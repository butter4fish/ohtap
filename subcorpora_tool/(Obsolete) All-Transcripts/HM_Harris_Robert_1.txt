Story_ID: 570711
Speaker 1: Okay, we're gonna get started. And I wanna start out by asking about your mother, Lucy. If you could talk about her background and what you know about her growing up.
Speaker 2: My mother, Lucy Lois Harris [Lucy Luster Harris], born in Arkansas. She is eighty-four years old, be eighty-five years old on her birthday. She was one of about ten children, grew up very poor in rural Arkansas. She spent most of her life working as a domestic, and I believe she reached the third grade, but never any education beyond that, but was a Ph.D. in how to raise children and how to survive in life.
Speaker 1: Do you remember any stories she told you about her growing up, sir?
Speaker 2: Well, what I remember most was that they had to work hard; they had to stay out of trouble; and they had to try to be somebody.
Speaker 1: Do you know where she was born?
Speaker 2: She was born in a rural section of Arkansas by a midwife, same as I, and not in a hospital.
Speaker 1: Okay. And do you know any of the, you know--how far back do you know on, going on her side? Do you know much going back?
Speaker 2: She was a Luster, maiden name was Lucy Luster. Pretty much can trace her back to the Lusters maybe forty or fifty years after slavery, in the late 1800s, probably about 1890--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and beyond.
Story_ID: 570712
Speaker 1: Now let's go to your father. His name was Ben, right, that is (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Benjamin Franklin Harris [Benjamin Harris]. He too grew up in Arkansas, descended of both the Harris and the Williams. The Williams' side of the family, which was his mother, Mary Williams [Mary Harris], very prominent in terms of owning land in Arkansas, mostly cotton, corn, and other stuff like that, but also very, very poor but hardworking people, very proud people who always earned a good living for their family. My father at about age thirty became a minister, and for the rest of his life, almost fifty, fifty-two years he was a minister, pastor in the Church of God in Christ in Arkansas, pastored two churches, Carthage, Arkansas, Church of God in Christ in Carthage and Church of God in Christ in Kingland, Arkansas [sic. Kingsland, Arkansas]. The first church he pastored was in Ogden, Arkansas, which is down near Texarkana, Arkansas.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now, did he share any stories of him growing up?
Speaker 2: Well, the stories that they both always shared was that you need to get an education, work hard, and quote, be somebody. They shared stories in terms of demonstrations of hard work, and that you're gonna have to work for all that you get in life, and that nobody's gonna give you anything, and that you just can't sit around and do nothing. You have to be--
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: So your, your father--I know you said that they shared the lessons of, of, you know, what the value of hard work (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 2: --was. What about his side of the family? How far back do you know?
Speaker 1: Oh, we can trace his side of the family, the Harris side, back to North Carolina. Grandpa, Grandpa Henry Harris migrated to Arkadelphia [Arkansas] from North Carolina in the late 1800s, around 1895, I believe it was. He was born in, I believe it was 1878, and so he came to Arkansas as a little boy with his parents [Ailie Harris and James Harris, Sr.]. And that's about far back as we can go. But we do know that they came from North Carolina and that they came--his, Grandpa Henry's parents, I think they were in fact slave--matter of fact, I know they were in fact slaves.
Story_ID: 570713
Speaker 1: How many children in your family, sir?
Speaker 2: There are five of us.
Speaker 1: And where do you fit in the birth order (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I'm in the middle.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I have a oldest sister, older brother--
Speaker 1: Can you give their name?
Speaker 2: --and then two younger brothers. My oldest sibling is Jean Blacksher [Jean Harris Blacksher], spelled J-E-A-N, B-L-A-C-K-S-H-E-R. She's the oldest in the family. The second oldest is Leonard [Leonard Harris], L-E-O-N-A-R-D, Harris, and of course, me, and then my brother next to me is Harold [Harold Harris], H-A-R-O-L-D, Harris, and then my may--baby brother is Charles Harris. And then there was one who died right after he was born. His name was Fred Harris [ph.], so he never really lived. He was born 1955.
Speaker 1: So out of those, you said five children, were they four boys? Did I hear it right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Four boys and one girl.
Speaker 1: One girl, okay.
Speaker 2: Right--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --with the sister being the oldest.
Speaker 1: Okay. So how did that work? Did she--did you all have to do her beck and call, or she was doing all of the boys' beck and calls?
Speaker 2: She was in charge.
Speaker 1: Okay (laughter).
Speaker 2: And she's always been in charge, and she continues to be in charge.
Story_ID: 570714
Speaker 1: Let's talk about your--I wanna--when, when your father [Benjamin Harris]--I just want to establish something. When he decided to enter the ministry, how old were you?
Speaker 2: Oh, I was about eight or nine years old.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay. Now, I want to take you to your earliest memory. What was your earliest memory of growing up?
Speaker 2: My earliest memory of growing up was when I was about four years old, starting school at Williams elementary school [Williams School] in Arkadelphia, Arkansas, which was a two room school, grades one through four in one room and then four- five through eight in the other room. The entire school was a little bit larger than this particular room, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) How many students?
Speaker 2: It had about oh, maybe thirty at most, about fifteen, sixteen in each room.
Speaker 1: And did you have two teachers or one?
Speaker 2: Two teachers.
Speaker 1: Two teachers.
Speaker 2: The one through four was one teacher, and then five through eight was another teacher.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And the one that I remem- remember most is a teacher called Mrs. Braggs [ph.]. She had this big switch. And she would get your attention, and she maintained decorum, and she insisted on learning. And she didn't, she'd never heard of the phrase that a student could not learn. She was convinced that everybody could learn.
Speaker 1: Now was she one to, one to four, or was she--
Speaker 2: She was five through eight.
Speaker 1: Eight, okay. Now, you said that was your earliest memory. What about that memory sticks with you, if you take yourself back to that schoolroom? Can you describe it?
Speaker 2: Was the fundamental belief in education, that you need an education, that you need to learn, you need to study, you need to take education seriously, and that learning was an essential part of life; and, and if you didn't learn, you would not be prepared to deal with life. And it has to be put in the context of, of the times, segregation; schools were segregated; everything was segregated in Arkansas at that particular time, water fountains, restrooms, et cetera, so it was just sole segregation. This was in the late '40s [1940s], early '50s [1950s].
Speaker 1: Were you, were you aware though of the segregation as a little tot, I mean little kid? You weren't, were you?
Speaker 2: Yes you were, because (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You were--
Speaker 2: --every time--
Speaker 1: So talk about--
Speaker 2: --you go to town you would see colored signs here, colored only, white only, and then whatever that didn't look good was for black folks. Oh yes, that's a memory that you never forget.
Story_ID: 570715
Speaker 1: Can you describe what family life was like?
Speaker 2: Family life was very good. We were a very closely knit family. We always had enough food to eat, and we just had a good time. We had no idea, certainly I didn't, I had no idea we were poor, even though I only had one pair of shoes for the entire year, and usually a couple of pair of pants, and had to go barefoot in the summertime. But I never perceived that as being anything that was different from anything else. It was just part of life, and we played and had a good time, was very enjoyable.
Speaker 1: If we could take you back to your community, you know, growing up, if you could tell me what sights, smells, and sounds remind you of growing up.
Speaker 2: Well, we were in the country, way back in the country, something like twelve, thirteen miles outside of Arkadelphia, Arkansas, in the rural section, so the smell of springtime is just sweet. There were crops growing all over the place, watermelons, et cetera, the corn patches, and of course, the cotton patches, the cotton fields where we had to pick cotton from sunup to sundown. We had to chop cotton; we worked. We had no options. Everybody in the family worked. So growing up, my memories growing up in, in those days is one of excitement but certainly one of very, very hard work. And my [paternal] grandfather [Henry Harris] used to say, "You shouldn't be sitting idly by," that you should be doing something at all times, that just sitting by being lazy is not good for you, so get up and do something, if it's nothing more than move this rock from here to elsewhere. So, the atmosphere was one of work, one of responsibility, and also one of, of, of, of fun, and, and, and having a good time. We did our share of devious stuff, like stealing a few watermelons here and there and doing stuff that kids normally do and occasionally get caught, and of course, the spankings that would follow, which would help to teach a lesson, that if you do wrong, there's a price to pay. And that accountability will always follow you in life.
Speaker 1: Now you mentioned sights. What about sounds or smells?
Speaker 2: Well, the, the, the sounds pretty much of like springtime with the birds and all of the things that you tend to hear when you are out in the country. Sometimes it's just silence, but other times it's the birds, the owls, the, all of the noise that some of the animals tend to make. Smells, always smell good. The environment was not like it is today. The environment was much cleaner, so the smells were much better. So it was usually always a sweet springtime, fresh smelling atmosphere.
Speaker 1: You like springtime, don't you? And then (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Springtime in, in Arkansas was always a good time because you got your showers; everything is turning green, and it's not as much work to do at that time because the planting of the crops had not yet begun because of the rainy season coming out of winter. And, but you would know that a few weeks later that the real work would come. The cotton is planted. When the cotton is planted, the cotton begins to grow, and as the cotton begins to grow you have to hoe it. And a lot of people call it chopping cotton, but we refer to it as, as hoeing and chopping the cotton. In other words, getting the grass out of the cotton so that it could grow.
Speaker 1: You know, now that was spring. Were there other traditions that you had, you know, given the seasons? Can you sort of review those that were around the whole family?
Speaker 2: Well, summertime was a time around the whole family because it was usually warm, and usually in the summertime, especially late summer, you're out in the cotton field. Almost everybody's out there picking cotton. And that's an interesting time because it's hot. But at the same time, you come back home and there's the big family dinners and stuff like that. Christmastime was always a good times because you would usually get a toy or so at Christmas, not much, few apples, oranges, pecans, small stuff like that, and occasionally a cap pistol; that was all fun. But again, family was always an essential part of it because we had a very intact family, very religious family, and we all went to church, and we went to church constantly.
Story_ID: 570716
Speaker 1: Now you--your, I know your father [Benjamin Harris] became a minister of the Church of God in Christ, but were you raised up until eight or nine in the Church of God in Christ (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, can you talk about the church that you were rai- the church that you were raised in up until that time, was that the same church that your--
Speaker 2: Same church.
Speaker 1: --father--okay, ended up in?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, same church.
Speaker 1: Can you talk about, you know, church service, you know what it was like? Who was the minister before your father? Do you remember who that was before your father? You don't know--I mean--
Speaker 2: No (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) if you don't remember, okay. But do you remember your father, why he became a minister? Do you--was there any discussion that you--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: There's a story. Allegedly, my father was sort of wild, would drink a lot. And then during a revival, I believe it was around 1950 or 1951 when I was six or seven, maybe eight years old, they were having a revival and what they call a tabernacle, where you get--build your own little church out in the woods there. And a, a minister was there having a revival, and he was one of the people that got saved. And in the Church of God in Christ in those days you would listen to the word of God, and the saints would be singing and dancing and praising, and then the spirit hits you, and then you get converted. And he--the spirit hit him; he got converted and was saved and sanctified, and I believe within a year or so, he, the Lord called him to preach. You didn't--he didn't go to divinity school. He wasn't taught to be a minister. He was called by the Lord, and that's how he became a minister.
Speaker 1: So did that change family life at that point, when he became a minister? 'Cause you said he began with the church in Ogden. Is that, did I understand?
Speaker 2: That was--Ogden, Arkansas was the first church that he pastored.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: After he became a minister he founded that church in Ogden. Oh yes, it changed quite a bit. Prior to that, my mother [Lucy Luster Harris] was a member of the church. She was saved and sanctified, and he was, as I said before, the wild one. But once he became saved and sanctified, then the focus on church became even more intense, because now you have both parents that are in the church, and the church become, became a, a focus point of life. You go to church on Sundays, every Sunday, and usually one or two times during the week, depending on the occasion. But yes, church become--was very instrumental in everything that we did.
Speaker 1: So talk about the roles then at that point. Because your father is pastoring a church, then the role--the whole family has to be involved in some respects.
Speaker 2: Absolutely. The whole family went to church. We would all get in the car and go to church on Sunday. You didn't have an option not to go to church; you could not opt out. You know, some people, "I don't want to go church." You went to church whether you liked it or not.
Speaker 1: And so when did church begin, and when did it end? I just--
Speaker 2: Usually Sunday school would start around nine or ten o'clock in the morning, and then by the time the church is over, it's about 2:00, sometimes 2:30, depending on whether or not people got really stimulated by the services. And sometimes the saints would praise the Lord continuously, and the church could go as late as three o'clock in the afternoon. It also depended on the preacher, how long he wanted to preach. But you could count from at least nine to three on every Sunday in church and then oftentimes YPWW, Young Peoples Willing Workers [sic. Young People Willing Workers], in the evening, Sunday evening, usually from about 6:00 to 8:00 or 8:30.
Story_ID: 570717
Speaker 1: Now did you take a--I, I want to take a little bit back because your father [Benjamin Harris] became a minister you said, you know, when you were eight, you know, eight or nine years old. What were you like as a--you know, you're the middle child. You know, often they say middle child, children get lost, but that doesn't seem to be case. But you know, the middle child is right there smack dab in the center. What were you like as a young person? You know, were you in it? You know, were you sort of a thinker? Were you, you know, typical boy? I mean what were you like?
Speaker 2: I was probably typical. My sister [Jean Harris Blacksher] and brothers said that I tended to focus on education and quote, was smart in school. But I was a typical kid, getting into trouble, trying to get away with as much as I could get away with without getting caught, and occasionally got caught, and obviously got many spankings as I grew up, and I needed them, obviously. But I think I had a reputation for, quote, being studious, and smart, taking care of business. As they used to say, Robert Lewis [HistoryMaker Robert Lewis Harris] is, is a good student.
Story_ID: 570718
Speaker 1: What subjects did you gravitate to, that you liked?
Speaker 2: I think it was primary--history and English. Those are the ones that I recall that I enjoyed most, is history and English.
Speaker 1: What appealed to you about them?
Speaker 2: I think what appear- appealed to me about history was the sense of knowing the universe in which you live and understanding the world in which I was growing up; English, of course, was the ability to communicate, write, speak, et cetera.
Speaker 1: Okay. And do you remember--you, you talk about the one teacher that you had [at Williams School, Arkadelphia, Arkansas], that you remembered, you know, in the--
Speaker 2: Ms. Braggs [ph.] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) Ms. Braggs. Tell--what, what, what struck you about her? Were, was, were you her pet in some respects, you know, within that--
Speaker 2: Ms. Braggs did not have pets. What struck me most about her was that she fundamentally believed that all children could learn. And she was convinced that it was no such thing as a child who could not read. And I recall specifically that everybody in her class learned to read, write, and do arithmetic. And that struck me, and, and over the years, it has always stayed with me. And I have cited her numerous times throughout my career as a teacher who fundamentally believed in children and, and fundamentally believed that children, all children, could learn, given the environment and stimulation to learn. So she has always been someone that stands out in my mind--
Speaker 1: Now--
Speaker 2: --although she was tough.
Speaker 1: Okay. She was tough.
Speaker 2: She was tough.
Speaker 1: Okay. But you, did you get good grades from her?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 570719
Speaker 1: Now did part of your--you know, often in the community, you know, in the black community, when there was a child that showed promise, you know, the whole community would sort of rally around that child. Did you find that that happened with you, you know, in the community or in church itself?
Speaker 2: No, I, I don't recall being given special attention because of that, because there were many students who really were doing well in school in terms of the standards of that particular rural school [Williams School, Arkadelphia, Arkansas]. I do recall that, again, I was considered to be, quote, one of the better students, not necessarily the best, but certainly one of the better students of the school and was, when we had school plays and other things like that, I was given the opportunity to participate, et cetera. But in terms of the community rallying around, it was a different kind of community, closely knit community, small community, maybe a hundred or fewer people, and everybody was accountable to everybody. So if I were seen doing something by somebody else, my aunt, uncle, or anybody on the community, I knew that I was gonna get disciplined long before I got home, and then, by the time I got home, I was gonna get another one. So, it was a sense that everybody was responsible for everybody else's child.
Speaker 1: Now, can you describe your community, you know, the community you grew up, some of the, you know, your relatives or you know, the--which street did you live on? Was there a--
Speaker 2: We didn't have streets.
Speaker 1: --street--
Speaker 2: They have been named now as streets, but back when I was growing up, it was just roads. So you knew that you would go X number of distance, and then you see this tree, and then you turn right and go down that lane, et cetera. There were no formal streets at all. They did not name the streets in (cough), out in Williams Town where I grew up, or Manchester [Arkadelphia, Arkansas] it's occasionally called, until about a decade or so ago. Prior to that you just had to know what roads to go, and they were all dirt roads, dirty and dusty.
Speaker 1: But who are some of your neighbors? Do you remember their names?
Speaker 2: Well, the nearest neighbors are usually, because of the rural setting, would be, were a quarter of a mile away. The closest house to us, in addition to Grandpa Henry [Harris' paternal grandfather, Henry Harris], was the Knox family [ph.]. They were at the end of the road. And then across from them was Mr. Pappy [ph.] and, and, and Ms. Julie [ph.]. And then down the road from them was Uncle Joseph [Joseph Williams (ph.)] and Aunt Florine [Florine Williams (ph.)]. And then down from--across from there was Uncle Perkins [Perkins Williams (ph.)], all Williams, and then on down the road was Uncle Jacob [Jacob Williams (ph.)], who was the twin brother of uncle, Uncle Joseph, and the Aunt Flossie [Flossie Williams (ph.)]. And then on up the road to the next house up the road was one of my other great uncles, and he was a Williams, and on and on and on. Then if you turn and go back up the other road, you'll find the Goodlows [ph.], and then the Perrys [ph.], and then some more Williams, et cetera. So it was a lot of relatives. Matter of fact, I would say 75 percent of the people were related.
Speaker 1: So it was a big community.
Story_ID: 570720
Speaker 1: If you established a church, it was your church. It is not quite like that today, but that's how it was then. You established a church, and that was your church, your domain. And ultimately, you were within a district, and you would have a superintendent of that particular district, but that was your church.
Speaker 2: So when he [Harris' father, Benjamin Harris] moved from Ogden to Carthage to Kingland [sic. Kingsland, Arkansas], what, what, what was necessitating those moves, and who was replacing him, you know, or, or did he go around to all three?
Speaker 1: Well, initially it was Ogden, Arkansas, which was almost eighty-five miles one way from Arkadelphia [Arkansas], so that was a long drive. He established and built that church. And it was there almost a decade, but the distance was really too far, because leaving home, getting to Ogden, and then when church is over with, driving back, all the way back to Arkadelphia became difficult. So eventually he gave that up as he established a church, the next church was in Carthage, Arkansas, where they I guess needed a pastor, and the church decided they wanted him. And then while--after he was Carthage, then, and another place needed a church in Kingland. And so he succeeded a person down in that old raggedy building that we built up. And so he ended up with two churches at the same time, Carthage and Kingland.
Speaker 2: So he would travel be--would he do one Sunday at one church and another at the other church, or (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That is, that is correct. When he had the two, he would usually do every other Sunday, so two Sundays in Kingland, two Sundays in Carthage. So every Sunday he was at one or the other.
Speaker 2: Now how did your father go about preparing? 'Cause see, he was working during the week, right?
Speaker 1: For a number of years, absolutely. He worked at a brickyard up until, maybe he was fifty, fifty-five, somewhere around there before--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --he quit.
Speaker 2: And so how would he prepare for his sermons, one, and then, two, is there any one of his sermons that sticks out for you that you remember?
Speaker 1: He prepared for his sermons by reading the Bible. And unlike and some of the sermons nowadays where you prepare a text and read it, read that text to the congregation, what he would do is select scriptures from the Bible and then use that as a text, gonna talk on the subject of whatever it is based on what was in that verse, and then you preach from memory and not necessarily from any script. I don't recall any particular sermon that stands out in my mind. Many of them just, they were all inspiring, and, and he loved to preach about Jesus, and doing the right thing, the Ten Commandments, and all of the typical stuff that ministers in the Church of God [Church of God in Christ] tend to preach about, sinning and stuff like that.
Speaker 2: Now was--Y, YP--what, what is it, Y--the young, young people's--
Speaker 1: YPWW?
Speaker 2: The--right.
Speaker 1: Young People Willing Workers.
Speaker 2: Did you take a leadership role in that organization?
Speaker 1: Well, we didn't have so much leader roles in the organization out in the country there. The purpose of that was to really teach you the responsibility of young people in terms of their duties to Christ, and living right, and the Bible, et cetera. So it was an opportunity for young people to, in a different situation, learn about the Bible in, in the church. And the regular church tends to come from an adult perspective; whereas the YPWW is from the young people's perspective.

Speaker 1: After eighth grade, where are you going to school? At a (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Peake High School, P-E-A-K-E, High School in Arkadelphia, Arkansas, was the nearest colored high school. So everybody who graduated out in the country in Clark County [Arkansas], all the colored people then went, once they done--finished elementary, which is the eighth grade, they would all then go into Arkadelphia on the bus to Peake High School. So throughout the county you would have maybe seven, eight elementary schools all coming in to Arkadelphia for the high school, with was ninth through twelfth.
Speaker 1: Okay and this is, really at this point it's nineteen fifty--maybe '54 [1954] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) About 1956.
Speaker 1: Six [1956], okay, 1956, when you start high school?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now, what was that high school like?
Speaker 2: Oh, I thought it was the biggest school I'd ever seen in my life, and it was (laughter). Well, it's all-black teachers. Here you had no longer fifteen or twenty students. You now had maybe two hundred students, with a big auditorium, classrooms of maybe forty students or more, which was--one classroom would have more students than my whole elementary school had. And, and you get exposed to lots of different students, people you'd never seen before.
Speaker 1: And this is probably exciting to you too (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It is, it was, it was very exciting, this big, new school, this huge school, all these strange people.
Speaker 1: Now did you have--since you had a lot of relatives around you, did that result in a lot of your cousins being at the school too with you?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, right, a, a number of--just everybody who graduated from the eighth grade in el- Williams elementary school [Williams School, Arkadelphia, Arkansas] would come to Peake High School in Arkadelphia.
Speaker 1: Okay. You said--was, was it called Williams elementary--
Speaker 2: It was just called Williams elementary school.
Speaker 1: But wasn't your family the Williams?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: My, on my father's mother's [Mary Harris] side. The whole town is called Williams. You remember I said up the road was Uncle Perkin Williams [ph.], Jacob Williams [ph.], Joseph Williams [ph.], Beasley Williams [ph.], on and on. And that's why it eve- it is even known today as Williamstown [ph.], because most of the--
Speaker 1: I see (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) people were Williams.
Story_ID: 570722
Speaker 1: What are you in, in high school [Peake High School, Arkadelphia, Arkansas]? Are you still gravitating towards English and history? And do you remember any teachers specifically there that influenced you?
Speaker 2: Yes, I do recall several teachers who had influence, although they were not necessarily English or history teachers. But I recall each--as a matter of fact, he just died a couple of years, C.B. Blevins [ph.], who was a science teacher. He was very, very impressive because he really demanded excellence, and he just had control of his classroom and really had students believing in themselves. The other teacher I recall specifically was--well two others actually, Ms. Snowden, who was a math teacher, who was very similar; and then Mr. Caesar [ph.]. Mr. Caesar was somewhat older. He was a shop teacher, and he believed in strict discipline, and was very, very impressive, and he held you to a very, very high standard.
Speaker 1: And what are, were the other--were there activities and clubs during high school? Do you remember, or--
Speaker 2: Oh yes, yes, yes--
Speaker 1: Okay, and--
Speaker 2: --although we didn't get to participate that much because we had--we were bused in, and the bus leaves at a certain time. But the ones that I remember mostly were the school plays. And I was in an, several school plays, so that was my passion again, the acting and the being able to act in the school plays. So I did participate in a number of school plays.
Speaker 1: And were there--who, who--what were you like at that point? I mean what are you thinking? You know, 'cause you're at the age of discovery in many ways. You know, this is a new experience, being with all these students. That had to be exciting.
Speaker 2: It was. And I was considered--once I got to high school, again, I was considered to be very studious, and if I recall correctly, I was the number two person in the class. The number one person was a fellow named Orlando, Orlando Maken [ph.], who was a relative of mine from a different rural community. And he was number one, and I was number two. I could never beat him (laughter), but that was all right. He was, he was, he was very smart and, and, and very good.
Speaker 1: What is he--have you kept in touch with him?
Speaker 2: Yes, he is--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --still down there.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now, when you--what are you thinking? Are you always thinking you were going on to, to college, or what is, what is, what's happening at--
Speaker 2: I always thought I would go to college because I was always led to believe that I was smart and that education is very important, as my parents [Lucy Luster Harris and Benjamin Harris] emphasized. And there was no question in my mind that I would graduate from high school and go on to college, whether it be Henderson State [Henderson State Teachers College; Henderson State University, Arkadelphia, Arkansas], which had just been integrated in 1957 [sic.], or to one of the black colleges [HBCUs] there, such as Arkansas A and N--AM and N [Arkansas Agricultural, Mechanical and Normal College], which is now University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff [Pine Bluff, Arkansas], or Philander Smith College [Little Rock, Arkansas]. But I was going to college. There was never any doubt in my mind that I was gonna go to college.
Story_ID: 570723
Speaker 1: And you end up going to--well, no, but wait a minute. How do you end up--because at age sixteen you end up moving to, to, to California. Does--and how (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 1: --does that happen?
Speaker 2: My sister, Jean [Jean Harris Blacksher]--
Speaker 1: Your oldest sister.
Speaker 2: My oldest sister and only sister--
Speaker 1: Sister.
Speaker 2: --Jean, left California--I mean, left California--left Arkansas, went to California with one of our aunts--uncles in nine- when she graduated--a year after she graduated from high school, she graduated from high school, Peake High, and then went one year at Henderson State College [Henderson State Teachers College; Henderson State University, Arkadelphia, Arkansas]. And then in 1958--I believe it was the fall of '58 [1958], went to California. And a couple of years later in California she married Artis Blacksher. And a couple of years later would be the year of 1960. So in 1960 I was given the opportunity--I'd just come from throwing hay on a truck, bales of hay, hundred pounds--this is August. You--I weighed about 125 [pounds]. You picked the bale of hay up, hit it on your knee, and it goes up on a moving truck. And the hay comes back in your face, hot, humid, and sticky, and itchy. So I got home that evening, and this was about, oh, three or four weeks before the cotton picking season started, and cotton picking season is a whole other story. But anyway, when I got home, mother [Lucy Luster Harris] said that she had received a call from Jean, wanting to know whether or not I wanted to come to California and finish my last year of high school. I'd made sixteen in March, and this was August, and then my senior year would have started in September at Peake High School [Arkadelphia, Arkansas], where I'd been elected--what was I, vice president, I believe it was, of the student body. And, but, when my mama, mother conveyed the message, do you want to go to California to live? No, she didn't say do you want to go; she say, "Your sister's asked you to come to California and finish your last year there, and I know you don't want to go." That's what my mother said. I said, "Yes, I do" (laughter). All I had to do was just remember that hot cotton field coming up. The next day I would have been back in that hayfield, throwing that hay up on that truck, and of course, it was an easy decision. The next morning my mother and father [Benjamin Harris] were at the bus station, Continental Trailways [Trailways National Bus System; Trailways Transportation System, Inc.] in Arkadelphia, with my cardboard suitcase all packed, and I'm on the bus, back of the bus, of course, heading for the first time out west. So that's essentially how I got to California. So I rode the back of the bus all the way from Arkadelphia, Arkansas, to Albuquerque, New Mexico, before I could sit anywhere other than the back of the bus, because in 1960 segregation was still the law of the land in Arkansas, Texas, and it was only when you got to New Mexico that you could sit anywhere on the bus that you wanted to sit.
Story_ID: 570724
Speaker 1: Let's talk about what was happening in Arkansas because, you know, to date, we've sort of painted a, you know, very sort of insular picture, except you, you know, had said earl- you know, very early, remember saying, you know, the colored signs and separate--and during this time, you know, there have been--you had made some sort of reference to, you know, there was one integrated, you know, that, or a school being integrated.
Speaker 2: College.
Speaker 1: College. I'm sorry--college. Do you remember anything, you know, around integration or Brown v. Board of Education [Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954] or even not if, if it wasn't Brown, just the whole talk of integrating, and resistance, and you know, any incidents happening, you know, where people had fear, or you know, there was some disruption?
Speaker 2: Well, we re- I remember all of the news publicity in 1954 around Thurgood Marshall and his big [U.S.] Supreme Court decision, Brown v. the Board of Education, ending quote, segregation and education. But it really had no meaning in Arkansas at that time because the schools continued to be integrated [sic.] because the Supreme Court decision didn't really bring about immediate integration, said with all deliberate speed. And the next thing I remember was the quiet integration of Henderson State College [Henderson State Teachers College; Henderson State University, Arkadelphia, Arkansas] in 1957 [sic.], with John Taylor being the first black student to go to Henderson State, and that was done without any controversy at all. So, on the college level in Arkansas in 1957, it was very quiet. But on the high school level, the nation was really blown apart because of Central High School in Little Rock [Arkansas], where the Little Rock Nine attempted to enter Central High School and ended up with the National Guard having been, having to be called out by President Eisenhower [President Dwight David "Ike" Eisenhower]. So on the one hand, you had a quiet integration of a college there in Arkadelphia, Arkansas, Henderson State College, now Henderson University. But on the other hand, in terms of the high school level, you had just absolutely pandemonium up in Little Rock, sixty-five miles away, where the whole nation is focused on what's going on there.
Speaker 1: Do you remember discussions around Little Rock, you know, in your family and things like church or--
Speaker 2: Not in church at all. I don't ever recall in church there was any discussion around integration, very little discussion in the high school itself [Peake High School, Arkadelphia, Arkansas]. It was primarily the way it was. And people didn't like it, but in Arkadelphia there were at that time no organized protests, although people were aware of Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] and others, and certainly supported that, but did not organize right there in the small town of Arkadelphia any protests.
Speaker 1: Do you remember any of people really saying that they did not support--you know, that it was better to leave things as they were? Do you remember any--
Speaker 2: No (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) No discussion about that?
Speaker 2: No, there was no discussion about better to leave things as they were. But I think most people felt as though it should be changed, but there was no vehicle for effectuating that particular change, and things continued. And I think people really felt that at some point integration would come to Arkadelphia, and ultimately it obviously did, after I left of course.
Story_ID: 570725
Speaker 1: Now when you--that morning that you left, 'cause that was sort of pretty speedy here, you know.
Speaker 2: It was quick.
Speaker 1: It was--can you remember how you felt, and, and, and so if you take yourself back there. If mean you're, you know, you're going with your sister [Jean Harris Blacksher], so it's someone you know. Your, your parents [Lucy Luster Harris and Benjamin Harris] are there with your cardboard suitcase. I mean, how are you sort of feeling, you know, that, that, that morning?
Speaker 2: Well, my gut feeling was that, wow, I no longer have to be in the hayfield; I won't have to worry about picking cotton; and I can go to school. Because the first several weeks of school in cotton picking season you had to miss school to pick cotton. I said wow, I don't have to do that anymore. Now I'm on my way to California, and I can go to school full time and don't have to worry about being in that hot cotton patch, and, and, and the cotton patch was hot, I mean really hot and humid, sunup to sundown. So, just thinking about that was enough incentive to really say wow, it's a great to leave. But then the dessert was the fact that you could devote full time to education.
Speaker 1: And when you got to New Mexico, did that have a sense of something different? You know, 'cause you were saying, you know, up until New Mexico you had to sit on the back of the bus. I mean was--
Speaker 2: Yeah (unclear)--and, and I did. I did not remain at the back of the bus. I did move up. And I felt for the first time that I could move freely. And you could move freely without worrying about whether or not the white bus driver was gonna throw you off the bus, which of course he legally could do up until you got to Albuquerque, New Mexico, or maybe it was Tucumcari [New Mexico]. I can't remember which one, but anyway, in New Mexico.
Speaker 1: Now did your, had your mother sent you off with a paper bag, you know, with food or--
Speaker 2: Oh yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay, okay.
Speaker 2: Oh yes, you gotta have that (laughter).
Speaker 1: Your chicken (laughter).
Speaker 2: Well, well when the bus stopped, you gotta remember you couldn't go into the regular restaurants. Unless they had a place for colored to order food, you out of luck. So you hope that at each bus stop they would have a place where the coloreds could go and order their food, but if not, you out of luck.
Speaker 1: Now when you--so this is new. Like really, you had not been out of Arkansas at that, until that point, had you?
Speaker 2: Right. Essentially, I'd been in the northern part of Louisiana, DeRidder, Louisiana. We had a uncle down there, but really, for the most part had never been out of Arkansas.
Speaker 1: So the reason I'm sort of point to his, 'cause it's all new terrain in some (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It is.
Speaker 1: --respects, you know--
Speaker 2: It was.
Speaker 1: --it looks different.
Speaker 2: It looked quite different.
Speaker 1: Okay. And, and so your sister and her husband [Artis Blacksher] greet you when you get--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: They were I believe at work. I was met at the Continental bus station [Trailways National Bus System; Trailways Transportation System, Inc.], 20th [Street] and San Pablo [Avenue] in Oakland, California, by my cousin, Roosevelt Harris [ph.], who had also come out to California about three or four years earlier. So he met me at the bus station with, in his nine--in his black 1956 Fairlane Ford [Ford Fairlane] (laughter), never forget that, just shiny as it could be. But as I--as we drove--as the bus drove into California now, into Oakland, all these lights. I never seen anything like it in my whole life. It was like, wow, this is a whole new world. So it was indeed a whole new world, bright lights, big city.
Speaker 1: And, and new, a lot of new opportunity or--
Speaker 2: I--
Speaker 1: --feeling.
Speaker 2: The feeling is that it's a whole new world, new opportunities, whole new world. And he took me to my sister's, which was at 1064 53rd Street in Oakland.
Story_ID: 570726
Speaker 1: And the next morning was opportunity to enroll in high school, because I think the enrollment had started the day before, so it was the second day at Oakland Technical High School [Oakland, California].
Speaker 2: Now did (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And that was some school.
Speaker 2: What--now this is--is this 1960--
Speaker 1: Nineteen sixty [1960]--
Speaker 2: Nineteen sixty [1960].
Speaker 1: --August of 1960. I believe the date was actually August 31st, 1960.
Speaker 2: Okay. And talk about this high school. What was different about the high school? How many black students are in the high school?
Speaker 1: It was the biggest high school I'd ever seen or dreamed of in my life. It was at, it is at 40th [sic.] and Broadway in Oakland [California], student body population of probably 2,000, 2,500 people. And in the class that I roll--enrolled in, which was a senior class, it was about four or five hundred students. The population at that time was approximately 10 percent black. And it was just a huge school. Again, it was about three fourths of a mile, maybe close to a mile from where my sister [Jean Harris Blacksher] lived. So my brother-in-law [Artis Blacksher] showed me how to get there, and I walked up there and enrolled in school.
Story_ID: 570727
Speaker 1: Was that difficult though, that being your senior year, I mean besides the--you know, 'cause it's all new. You--
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was quite different. I--you have to go to your counselor and get your classes. So I went to the counselor, a person I'll never forget as long as I live. Her name was Mrs. Hillegas, H-I-L-L-E-G-A-S [Miriam Hillegas], and saw all the courses that could be taken. And you had choices between college prep and non-college prep, what they call workshop and all that other stuff. And of course, having believed all along that I was bright and would go to college, so I signed up for all college prep courses and gave her the slip.
Speaker 1: And, and so that worked out--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She properly denied it (laughter).
Speaker 1: So tell me what happened. Let's talk about--
Speaker 2: Well, she was very kind. She looked at it, and I recall she looked back up at me like I wonder what's his problem. And either I brought with me or had my transcript from my prior--or my grades. It was my grades from my eleventh grade, having been finished eleventh grade at Peake High School [Arkadelphia, Arkansas]. And I presented those to her, which was essentially an A minus average, and she sort of frowned and smiled at the same time, as though this poor kid doesn't know. And she said, "We can't enroll you in college prep courses." "You can't enroll me in college prep courses?" She said, "No. You wouldn't be able to compete because you're coming from this school," and, she was trying to be helpful, I guess, "in Arkansas, and the kids in college prep are very smart students, and you just wouldn't be able to keep up with them." And I did not believe that. I, I mean, I just couldn't believe it. It was the first time in my life anybody had ever told me that I could not compete educationally. I'd never heard that concept before. And of course, she was the first white teacher, or counselor, that I had ever seen face to face. So, that was disappointing obviously. And I went back home that evening and gave the news to my sister [Jean Harris Blacksher], who went berserk and insisted that the next day that her husband, Artis [Artis Blacksher], who is 6'5", at that time at least 250 plus [pounds], today a little bit larger, who was instructed by her to go with me back to school. And Artis was high school graduation, truck driver; he was a member of the Teamsters [International Brotherhood of Teamsters]. And he went back with me the next morning to school to see Mrs. Hillegas. And I will always remember that morning because he was not diplomatic. He just went in and started raving at her. And of course, it scared the hell out of her, and she just said any course he wants he gets, any course he want and just, you know, like get out of here. This man is crazy (laughter). And so she signed, and I was able to get all of my college prep courses. And then I went to those courses, which was odd to me. I'd never seen this before, coming from an integrated--a segregated school into my first class in an integrated school. It looked--I'd seen black students at school, and population was about 10 percent or so, so you seen them. But when I got in the class, I think in any class I didn't see more than one black student outside of myself, and I thought that was strange. But then it dawned on me, ultimately, wait a minute; those students probably went through the same thing that I went through that my brother-in-law just went berserk on, and they weren't into the college prep courses because of the belief that they could not compete. And so I, in, in, at Oakland Tech [Oakland Technical High School, Oakland, California] I was usually one or two, three at the most, of blacks students in any of those college prep courses.
Story_ID: 570728
Speaker 1: It's your first--your last year but your first experience in, in the school [Oakland Technical High School, Oakland, California]. You are in a, a class totally different, where you have, you know, there is only one other black student you said in your classes.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, one or two others, right.
Speaker 1: One or two. And now do you get to know who those black students are, or the whole thing is strange, you know?
Speaker 2: Well, initially the whole thing is strange because you don't know anybody. It's your first exposure. But yes, ultimately you get to know the black students, and I think I got to know most of the black students who were in my class and then some who were below class, in grades below me. But one year is a short period of time with that many students in, in a school.
Speaker 1: So what--how are, how are your classes that year? How do you find them? Are they, are they more difficult than what you were exposed to before?
Speaker 2: I think they were more challenging because you have exposure to more materials, a real library, et cetera, so, it's, it's different. The challenge is different because, I think because of the exposure to more information. But I didn't perceive the, any real handicap at all. So I spent a lot of time studying, as students should spend studying, and I did fairly well. I was again able to maintain a good grade point average in the college prep courses and did well.
Speaker 1: When you say good grade point, was it A or B, was it?
Speaker 2: More like a B plus (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) B plu- okay, okay, okay, so that's--
Speaker 2: Between the B and the B plus--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --absolutely.
Story_ID: 570729
Speaker 1: So how do you decide that you're going to Merritt College [Oakland, California] then? What happens, you know, at that point?
Speaker 2: Well, what happened was, again, with my counselor, still the same Mrs. Hillegas [Miriam Hillegas], she didn't tell me my options. And I wasn't quite certain of my options in terms of going off to University of California or the state colleges, et cetera, or that perhaps there were scholarships available, et cetera. So I was a little bit naive myself by not knowing how to pursue. But on hindsight, I think it was a good decision. So instead, when I graduated from college, I had--I mean from high school, I had no options presented, and so I just didn't know. I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You mean she didn't present you--
Speaker 2: She presented no options, as counselors normally do, so the only option was to go to Oakland's junior college. At that time it was called Oakland Junior College, later, Oakland City College, and now Merritt College. So as soon as I graduated from Oakland Tech [Oakland Technical High School, Oakland, California], shortly thereafter, end of the summer I enrolled at Oakland Junior College. And there I--it was clear that I was going to enroll in courses that would lead to a state college, and so I took all course that would lead to San Francisco [California]. And, and the nearest college was San Francisco State College, now called San Francisco State University [San Francisco, California]. So at junior college I think I learned a lot. I really learned how to--what the college scene was like. I recall my English class. I think I got an A in it. It was very good. I believe the professor's name was Mr. Bach [ph.], and I thought he was a very good English teacher, and got through my two years at Merritt College. And it was a great experience because in several of my classes, and I recall clearly my philosophy class was, there were two people that stood out, one because he tried to take over the class and, and, and, and really did take it over for the most part, named Huey Newton [Huey P. Newton]; and the other one, of course giving him support, was Bobby Seale (laughter). So both Bobby and Huey were classmates in a number of classes there. When I got to--
Speaker 1: At San Francisco State.
Speaker 2: No, Merritt College.
Speaker 1: At Merritt.
Speaker 2: When I got there they were there. Merritt College at that time, again, was Oakland Junior College on Grove Street [Martin Luther King Jr. Way]. When I got there they were there, and when I left they were still there. And that's ultimately where they founded the Black Panther Party, at Oakland City College.
Speaker 1: Can you talk about them as young people, I mean what you knew, knew about them and--
Speaker 2: They were fun loving. Huey was a philosopher. He, he knew something about everything. He was very active, very involved. Bobby was a little bit more reserved, more studious, but they both were way out there in terms of their philosophy. Huey had a passion about life and what the world ought to be about, et cetera. And that's why he usually took over the philosophy, called Philosophy 1A we had. And he could rap about anything. And I guess about two years after I left Merritt College, which was '63 [1963], '64 [1964], '65 [1965], I guess '65 [1965] or '66 [1966] they founded the Black Panther Party, as you well know.
Speaker 1: What was he philosophizing about? I mean (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Everything you could think of. No matter what it is, Huey knew something about it (laughter), whether it's the theories of John Law or whatever, he, he, he knew something about it. And again, he was impressive because he, he was, he was very bright, very smart.
Speaker 1: So how many other black students were at, you know, Merritt?
Speaker 2: Oh, I was at Merritt, it was about 30 percent black at that particular--have Oakland Junior College because a lot of students who did not get into or know about the college, the state college system or the university system would end up at Merritt. And some of the great people in California ended up through the community college system, which is actually in California is a great system. I recommend it highly.
Story_ID: 570730
Speaker 1: Let me ask you, what is Oakland [California] like at this period of time? And you know, because now you're able to experience it a little bit more, even though you're in school [Oakland Junior College; Merritt College, Oakland, California], you know. But what are you learning about the community there? And you know, we're in the '60s [1960s], the beginning of the--I mean we're, you know, in the early '60s [1960s] still, so what are you--what is that community like, and how does it differ from the community you, you know, came from [in Arkansas]? Like, you have 30 percent black, but what is the other, you know, ethnic groups and--
Speaker 2: Mostly, at, at that per time- particular time, in the '60s [1960s] is black and white. Oakland was approximately 65, 70 percent, about 70 percent black at that particular time and about--70 percent white and about 30 percent black at that time, although the demographics changed. The latter part of the '60s [1960s], the migration began with many of the whites moving out to the suburbs, and Oakland became ultimately, in the late '80s [1980s] about 48 percent black. And today that has, through gentrification, has changed significantly. Now it's back down to about 30 percent black (laughter) and falling, falling rapidly. So it's almost like a total reverse back to where it was forty-seven years ago.
Story_ID: 570731
Speaker 1: Were there any people that you befriended or were your friends, you know, became your friends at, at Merritt College [Oakland Junior College; Merritt College, Oakland, California] then that, you know, have stayed your friends now even?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, there were several people I knew at city college that still are friends, some of whom have passed on. But yes, there were several that I still remember.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you did well at Merritt, and then you went on to San Fran--
Speaker 2: Transferred from--when I graduated from Merritt, which two years later, Merritt is a community college, two year college. I stayed on schedule. And then went directly to San Francisco State College [San Francisco State University, San Francisco, California], at the time. So I entered that fall of '63 [1963] and then graduated two years later, which was the summer of 1965.
Speaker 1: Now that was a active summer, right, but then you graduated. Weren't there (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --a series of campus riots?
Speaker 2: Not, not at San Francisco State.
Speaker 1: Not San- okay.
Speaker 2: That came later. That came about--
Speaker 1: That came later.
Speaker 2: --two years after I graduated--
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: --when President Hayakawa [S.I. Hayakawa] became president, and that's when San Francisco State and the Black Student Union erupted and went to war with each other. But '65 [1965] was the great riots in Los Angeles [California] and riots--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --throughout the nation actually, with the first one erupting down in Watts [Los Angeles, California]. I had graduated in June, well, I guess May of '65 [1965], and then June of '65 [1965] started as a probation officer at Alameda County Probation Department and was a deputy probation officer, so.
Story_ID: 570732
Speaker 1: Now what are you thinking you want to be at this point?
Speaker 2: A probation officer.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Well, you know, I'd, I'd majored in at, at San Francisco State [San Francisco State College; San Francisco State University, San Francisco, California] I'd majored in sociology and did a work study program over at the Pacifica Police Department as an intern, so I had some exposure to police work. But I thought at that particular time I wanted to do social type work. And so when I graduated from San Francisco State with a degree in sociology and minor in criminology, I had an option. The police department, Pacifica, had given me an offer as a result of my work study program there to join them or I guess my--another friend of mine in my class, Avon Manning [ph.], and I decided that why don't we try to become probation officers. So we took the test with Alameda County Probation Department, and we passed, and so we became deputy probation officer trainees in June of 1965. And I think that was a six week training program. And after that, we got our badges as deputy probation officers and assigned to the juvenile division. So at age twenty-one I was a juvenile probation officer.
Speaker 1: So what are you learning about the system, you know, the judicial system, the court system? What are you learning? And are--do you--are you in that position for how many, for--
Speaker 2: Four years (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Four years.
Speaker 2: You learn a lot, because in, in the 1960s, the probation officer essentially did everything in California. You are the investigator, and you presented the case in court, juvenile court. And then the kid is play--if the kid is found responsible, they call it, and called it guilty in those days, then he would be placed on probation, and you'd be the kid's probation officer. So, so you learn a lot about the court system because you are in it all the time, you're supervising the probationers. And then if they violate the probation, you're taking them back to court, so you're in constant contact with the legal system all the time. And, and, and in those days, kids were, unlike today, they were what I thought were horrible things, having come from Arkansas, like burglaries and assaults, stuff like that. But today it's child's play, in terms of what some of our kids are accused of.
Speaker 1: Now what are you--describe the, the juvenile system there at that point. I mean, who were mainly the kids coming through? How many cases were you, you know, was one probation officer--
Speaker 2: I had about two hundred cases; I would say, oh, almost 50/50, 50 percent white, 50 percent black. And most of the black kids were from either East Oakland [Oakland, California] or West Oakland [Oakland, California].

Speaker 1: Were there thoughts at that point in time about what to do with kids, you know, what the best way, you know, different treatments, 'cause they weren't being treated as adults, right?
Speaker 2: No (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) But--
Speaker 2: They were--right.
Speaker 1: Were they assign- being assigned to any detention centers or foster homes or--I'm trying to figure out what was--
Speaker 2: Right. Some were, if they were a, what we call a Section 601, which is a dependency child, they would be assigned to foster parents, which means that they hadn't committed any crimes themselves, but they didn't have any parents or means of support. So they were dependent upon the state for their survival, so therefore they would be put in a foster home or something like that. But most of the kids that I dealt with were what we called 601 [sic.], that kids who had been convicted of some statutory violation, and so they were all on probation from the home. So they would still be living at home, and some would be up in juvenile hall. We, we had several juvenile detention centers; boys' camp in those days they called them. And they could be on probation from the boys' camp, and you would supervise them again back into the home with the parents. The biggest problem was, was education around the school setting, and just about every, I would say 90 percent of the kids on probation had problems in the school system.
Speaker 1: Now were drugs playing a part at that time?
Speaker 2: Very minor part, some marijuana but not a big part in the '60s [1960s].
Speaker 1: Okay. Now what--did you feel that the system was working, you know, the--
Speaker 2: For the most part, yes.
Speaker 1: --the juvenile--you did?
Speaker 2: Yes, I, I felt as though the kids were treated fairly, and of course it was my job to make certain that they were treated fairly in the court system and while on probation. I didn't feel that they were being treated fairly in the educational system.
Speaker 1: Okay, and can you talk about that?
Speaker 2: Because in just about every case, in, in terms of two hundred cases that I had [at the Alameda County Probation Department], I would say 80 to 90 percent had problems in school as well. And almost 100 percent of the black students that I had on probation were either classified as educational handicap or attention deficiency, or whatever they call that stuff, and really treated as though that they couldn't learn. So it was like a vicious cycle in the education system. They were treated as though they couldn't learn, and the kid acted out. And it was predictable; they ended up back in trouble. So I saw a definite correlation between the educational system and how these kids ultimately ended up.
Speaker 1: Now how successful were you getting kids out of the system? Did you do that, or did most of the kids, once they were in the system, they were in the system?
Speaker 2: Most in them in the system stayed in the system.
Story_ID: 570734
Speaker 1: Now what makes you think of law school? What is that experience, and do you decide that you want to, you know, think about attending law school?
Speaker 2: Hadn't really given it too much though, although one, two, maybe four of the probation, deputy probation officers in the office [Alameda County Probation Department] were going to night law school at Golden State--Golden Gate law school [Golden Gate College; Golden Gate University, San Francisco, California] or at San Francisco Law School [San Francisco, California]. Then, with the assassination in 1968 of Martin Luther King, Jr. [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.], there was a cry throughout the nation for affirmative action and getting more blacks in the professional schools, and I happened to be a beneficiary of that. And Boalt Hall, University of California, Berkeley [University of California Berkeley School of Law, Berkeley, California], who had never had more than one or two blacks in any entering class, apparently was doing a recruitment. And one of the deputy probation officers who was in night school, law school, a fellow named Dennis Sullivan [ph.]--it wasn't Dennis Sullivan--Dennis, can't remember his last name now, but he was a white probation officer, and we were friends, and he mentioned one day to me, he said you know, "Boalt Hall is trying to get some black students. You ought to apply." And I hadn't thought about it. "Apply to Boalt Hall? Where is Boalt Hall," (laughter)? I, I, I really didn't know anything about the University of California school of law. Then, of course, I quickly found out what Boalt Hall was, and thought about it, and then decided that I would apply, and, and I did. And I got probate recommendations, one or two from the judges that I had worked with as a probation officer and was admitted. I only applied to one law school, 'cause my position was, well, I'm not gonna apply to anything, 'cause I wasn't about to leave and go off somewhere. So I said I'll apply to Berkeley. If I get into Berkeley, I'll go to law school. And I got into Berkeley, and I went to law school.
Speaker 1: Well, that opened up a new world in many ways (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It was totally--
Speaker 1: --totally different world.
Speaker 2: --totally different world, absolutely.
Speaker 1: Now--
Story_ID: 570735
Speaker 1: I just want to ask before we enter to law school [University of California Berkeley School of Law, Berkeley, California], because you know, '60s [1960s], I think of '60s [1960s] in the Bay Area [San Francisco Bay Area, California], you know, I mean besides the Black Panthers [Black Panther Party], a lot of free love, free sex, I mean (laughter) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh yeah, oh yeah.
Speaker 1: What--
Speaker 2: The flower children (laughter).
Speaker 1: The flower children, LSD--
Speaker 2: LSD, the whole bit. Haight Street in San Francisco [California], Telegraph in Berkeley [California].
Speaker 1: So are you participating in any of that at all? Are you sort of straight, you know, straight arrow, you know, working, you know?
Speaker 2: I'm a probation officer [in the Alameda County Probation Department].
Speaker 1: Officer (laughter).
Speaker 2: And as a probation officer, there are certain standards that you have to adhere to. So, no, I was not a flower child, hanging out on Haight or any of that stuff. I was a probation officer. The only reason out on Haight Street and Telegraph Avenue was trying to keep up with my kids (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Kids.
Story_ID: 570736
Speaker 1: Let's talk about the, the whole world that opened up when you got accepted into Boalt Hall [University of California Berkeley School of Law, Berkeley, California], which is a very, very good, you know, law school. So tell me what that, you know--I mean you had been a probation officer, so you were at least familiar with, you know, a part of the court system. So what--who--how many are in your entering class? And what other--are there other blacks in your entering class?
Speaker 2: There were a total of twelve blacks, largest number in the history of the law school, entered with me in 1969. And the law school, I believe my first year law school class had about five- maybe six hundred students. It was a whole new world. You had students from throughout the United States and actually throughout the world and supposedly some of the brightest. Boalt is still one of the top law schools in the nation. And so it was different. It was, wow, this is, this is strange. And, and the average age--I guess I was twenty-five when I started--so the average age was around twenty-four I think. So you had, I had older and younger to get to that average. So it was a, a whole new world, I mean with professors using the so called Socratic Method. And it's, it's a different exposure (laughter). So it was exciting. It was a, it was a real challenge.
Speaker 1: So now, would we know of anyone in your, you know, in your entering class that was black, or black or white? Would we know anyone?
Speaker 2: Today, the one that has a perhaps national reputation would be Calvin Grigsby. Calvin Grigsby went on to become one of the top investment bankers in the nation. He still has his firm there in San Francisco [California], although he's had some challenges, as you may recall from some of the news clipping. But Cly- Calvin Grigsby was one of my classmates I think that stood out in, in terms of African American classmates.
Speaker 1: Now you, your classes the first year you have torts--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --right, civil procedure; contracts?
Speaker 2: Contracts.
Speaker 1: Contracts.
Speaker 2: Criminal law and property.
Speaker 1: Crim- property, okay. Were those--this is all, you know, pretty different study than what you've been used to, so are they--are there any courses that you gravitate to more than the others, that you like?
Speaker 2: I liked torts; I like, I like contracts. Criminal law was okay, although I had long decided I did not want to be a criminal lawyer, having dealt with juveniles, and so the criminal justice system is not what I want. But I was intrigued by torts, intrigued by contracts, in particular.
Story_ID: 570737
Speaker 1: And now who were your--do you remember your teachers, your--who, who (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) My property teacher was Professor Hetland [John R. Hetland], who was considered one of the real experts in property in the State of California, written most of the books on the subject. And my tort teacher was Professor John Barnett [sic. Stephen Barnett], who's al- also considered one of the top professors on torts in the nation. So we had some, had some rather famous teachers.
Speaker 1: And the Socratic Method, how did you take to it, 'cause that--you know, can you describe the Socratic Method, first of all?
Speaker 2: Yes. You remember Socrates, who lectures and teaches? The Socratic Method is essentially where the, the professor will quiz you, "Ms. Richardson [Julieanna Richardson]," as you well know, "what about the case of Blevins versus Johnson? What was unique in that case?" What he mean, what was unique? And then they can just go on. It's almost like cross examination in a court. And that's totally different because a professor can just literally destroy you if he or she wants to, and of course, you could probably destroy the professor as well if the roles were reversed. But it's just the nature of the Socratic Method. You're engaged in dialogue, like Socrates used to do as he walked around in Greece just quizzing people.
Speaker 1: What did you find most challenging, and, and then on the other side, most engaging about your first year experience?
Speaker 2: I--in a diff- in addition to it being different, I really thought of it as an opportunity to really learn the law, how it operates. And I wanted to absorb as much as I could so that when I finished law school [University of California Berkeley School of Law, Berkeley, California] and became a lawyer, I would be hopefully effective at being a lawyer. So, actually, and, and students used to get upset with me about this. I said I actually enjoyed law school, 'cause law students have this--they like to say how much they hate law school, and here I am talking about how much I'm enjoying it. But I was enjoying it for a different reason, because I saw it as an opportunity to absorb and learn how to be a lawyer and then how to practice as a lawyer. So I just saw it as an opportunity to learn as much as I could.
Speaker 1: And this is, this is really, again, it's a lot of backdrop of a lot of things, you know, happening. The [HistoryMaker] Angela Davis case probably happened your third--
Speaker 2: My--
Speaker 1: --your third year (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) third year, my last year of law school.
Speaker 1: That last year of law school. But you had decided that you really were more interested, would I say in corporate? Had--was that your decision?
Speaker 2: Well, my decision was essentially non-criminal, so it would be either civil or perhaps corporate, and it, it, it ended up corporate by accident.
Story_ID: 570738
Speaker 1: Now what did you do after your first year of law school?
Speaker 2: Entered my (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What--
Speaker 2: --second year (laughter). I'm being facetious.
Speaker 1: What did you do that summer?
Speaker 2: At the end of my first year of law school, obviously I, I had survived, and you know, you want to celebrate, hey, Boalt Hall [University of California Berkeley School of Law, Berkeley, California], affirmative action; they say you couldn't compete, and you competed. And I was invited to join the law review. I joined the law review, and I found that to be extremely intriguing--one, two, three of us, other blacks, twelve blacks; I guess the second year we were down to eight, but three of the eight were invited to be on the law, law review, myself, Calvin--
Speaker 1: Grigsby [Calvin Grigsby].
Speaker 2: --Grigsby, and Jimmy Harris [ph.], who was really the, probably the brightest of all the law students, black law students, and he was at, way up in the, in the class.
Speaker 1: But this is, I mean you sort of like go over that like that's--that, that's very significant, to be in enjoin--invited to join the law review.
Speaker 2: Yeah, because then it, it's another opportunity to learn how to write. And writing for a lawyer, especially if you're not gonna be on the criminal side just handling criminal case after criminal case, if you're gonna get on the civil side, you, you're not gonna be in court that much, so you're gonna be persuading through documents. And I saw the law review as a real opportunity to learn how to write, and I took it seriously. Matter of fact, I published two articles in the California Law Review.
Speaker 1: Now what--do remember what the articles were on?
Speaker 2: Oh, boy, yes, I do. The first one was on the juvenile delinquency statute in California, as to whether or not it should be changed, and ultimately it was changed. And the second was on the second degree felony murder rule in California, the fairness of that second degree felony murder rule, and both are in 60 Cal Law Review [California Law Review, Volume 60].
Story_ID: 570739
Speaker 1: So what as most challenging though about that first year? You know, do you think, was it the, the amount of work? Was it the legal theory? Was it, you know, the, the Socratic Method of teaching? What did you find most challenging (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It was probably the Socratic Method of teaching as well as the fear of, how do I get through this as a first year student? Am I gonna make it? But after the first exam you tend to get over a lot of that. But the thing is, I think, I think the, the, the challenge of the first year is the fear of not making it. You don't want to flunk out.
Speaker 1: Right. So you--
Speaker 2: And I was in--I was determined not to flunk out.
Speaker 1: Okay. So you made it, and you're enjoying the experience too, you know--
Speaker 2: Yeah, psychologically I decided I'm in law school, and I'm gonna enjoy every moment of it.
Speaker 1: And so--
Speaker 2: And I did.
Speaker 1: --so when you came back, it was the second year. Was that the second year that you published both of the articles you spoke of (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The--
Speaker 1: --or was it--
Speaker 2: That's when I started writing the articles in this--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was selected to law review [California Law Review], and then during that first year you're doing mostly the research on your articles, and then the third year is usually when they are published.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now were there at, at, at, at Berkeley [University of California Berkeley School of Law, Berkeley, California], were there several different law reviews at that point in time or not?
Speaker 2: They were just starting up a law review called the ecology law review [Ecology Law Quarterly], which I assume now is the environmental law review. That was the only one--other one that was starting up. I think it started up maybe in my second year of law school.
Speaker 1: And when you--okay, so when you--talk about the law review a little bit, just about--because a lot of people don't understand law reviews, you know, and how they work. How are they governed? You know, who does what? How is it divided? How are assignments, you know, given out?
Speaker 2: The, the law review is the so called scholarly publication by the law school students. It is headed up by an editor-in-chief, who is selected by the other members of the law review. Then the editor-in-chief of the law review will assign associate edit- editors to do certain tasks. Everybody on law review is expected to publish at least one article, although some don't, and you're expected to edit and review the articles that are submitted by others on the law review. Because again, these are articles that's gonna be published in the law review which are read throughout the world. So it's a certain quality. You want to make certain that your law school is not embarrassed by some of the articles, so we did lots of proofreading, lots of cite checking, et cetera, et cetera. For example, if I were given an article, I had to go--had two hundred footnotes, had to check every single footnote to make certain that it was accurate.
Speaker 1: And at this point in time, there's nothing like BALSA existing on these campuses, are there?
Speaker 2: It was just the beginning.
Speaker 1: It was just the beginning, so--
Speaker 2: We started the Black Law Students Association I guess during my second year--
Speaker 1: Okay, so this--
Speaker 2: --at Berkeley.
Speaker 1: --so the year that you were actually on law review is when BALSA--
Speaker 2: BALSA [Black American Law Students Association; National Black Law Students Association] started, if I remember correctly, around 1969, 1968, 1969, late--yeah, yeah, about that time, by what's his name out of Alabama [HistoryMaker Algernon Johnson Cooper, Jr.]. And it got to California, Berkeley about 1970--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --two years later.
Speaker 1: So where you one of the founders of BALSA, or were you a participant on, on (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I was a participant--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --but I was not the leader.
Story_ID: 570740
Speaker 1: Now when you, your, your second year [at University of California Berkeley School of Law, Berkeley, California] you're taking courses like con- con-constitutional law.
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: Did you take corporations?
Speaker 2: Yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, okay. Evidence?
Speaker 2: Second year, con law, corporations, evidence, remedies, and your typical second year courses that you tend to take so that you have a broad understanding of the law and getting ready ultimately for the bar exam.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now are you looking for that summer in terms of what your job is gonna be? And what job do you have during your--
Speaker 2: The second year I went back to the probation department [Alameda County Probation Department]. It was guaranteed. They had given me an opportunity to come back to work. When I said second year, between the first and second, when I graduated the first--I mean when I finished the first year, there are very few jobs for a first year law student. And so the probation department was a natural for me to go back during the summertime and do investigations, which I did. So, between first and second, back to the probation department.
Speaker 1: Okay, and then what about between second and third?
Speaker 2: After the second year I went to a law firm.
Speaker 1: Okay, what law firm?
Speaker 2: A law firm in San Francisco [California] called--can't remember the name of it, but it's slipping my memory--
Speaker 1: That's okay.
Speaker 2: --but it was a law firm where Jerry Falk [Jerome B. Falk, Jr.] was one of the partners.
Speaker 1: Partners. Now did the, did that, was that part of your recruitment process there, or did you apply?
Speaker 2: I applied.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay. And what did you learn that summer? I mean how large was the firm?
Speaker 2: The firm at that time was about twenty lawyers. I learned a lot. I did a lot of research and did--I think that--what I remember most was I did some research on copyrights concerning George Schulz [sic. Charles M. Schulz] on the Peanut [Peanuts] character, and I thought that was very intriguing. So I learned a lot about copyright law.
Speaker 1: So were they, were, they were, were they--
Speaker 2: Howard, Prim [Howard, Prim, Rice, Nemerovski, Canady and Pollak] was the name of the law firm.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay, Howard, Prim.
Speaker 2: It still exists in San Francisco (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: --much larger now.
Speaker 1: Okay, did it have a large intellectual property practice? Is that--
Speaker 2: It was at the time a small, it was small. They had about three or four lawyers that worked on--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --intellectual property.
Story_ID: 570741
Speaker 1: Now, your, so your last year, what are you thinking you want to do? (Unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Get a job (laughter)--
Speaker 1: Okay, but, okay.
Speaker 2: Any kind of job, just get a job. You know, you graduate from law school [University of California Berkeley School of Law, Berkeley, California], you're looking for a job. You don't want graduate from law school and not have a job.
Speaker 1: So how did you, how did you end up at Pacific Gas?
Speaker 2: I interviewed for just about every law firm, major law firm in San Francisco [California]. I interviewed and got zero offers. And studying for the bar exam, I, I spent a lot of time over at the law school. I knew a couple people in the placement office. And they were, they were now and then, "How are you doing with your job?" I think I'd gotten one offer from Alameda County [California] legal services. And then finally, this lady in the placement office who I think she sort of liked me in terms of my diligence, and she said, "How would you like to interview at PG and E, Pacific Gas and Electric Company?" I'm thinking Pacific Gas and Electric Company, those are the people that come by and read my bill. Oh no, I don't want to go out and read bills. I want to be a lawyer. And she said, "Oh, they have a law department." I said oh, okay. And I was in the middle of studying for the bar exam, and I went over. She set up an interview for me to go over to San Francisco to interview at the law department in Pacific Gas and Electric Company. And I interviewed and interviewed and interviewed, and ultimately got an offer from Pacific Gas and Electric Company to join their legal staff. And of course, it was--I'd, I think I'd taken, already taken the bar, waiting--I took the bar in July, waiting on the results. I think my final interview with them was in late August, and they finally, finally, after all kinds of stuff--and I teased them over the years I don't think ever put anybody through what they put me through--so they finally made an offer. And of course, it was conditioned on the, on the fact that I pass the bar exam and made it clear (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Which is a lot of pressure.
Speaker 2: --which it made clear that if you, if your bar exam--view exams are negative, you don't pass, you're out of here (laughter). So on September 15, 1972, I started to work at Pacific Gas and Electric Company and was the twenty-seventh lawyer on staff. And by accident, it turned out to be thirty-four years of real enjoyment. And--
Speaker 1: Yeah, I want to talk about that just sort of in context. So you said you were the twenty-seventh law--
Speaker 2: Twenty-seventh--
Speaker 1: Okay, lawyer (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) lawyer on staff there.
Speaker 1: So, that is larger than I would have thought, you know, given the time--
Speaker 2: Um-hm, 1972.
Speaker 1: --you know, frame--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and, and in house. So how many black lawyers did they, had they had at that point?
Speaker 2: They had three in the history, never more than one at a time. The first one was Don Mitchell [Donald Mitchell], who came about 1966, left about 1968 to go to Boise Cascade [Boise Cascade Corporation; Boise Cascade Company]. Don is still alive, is a friend of mine. I still met him--I mean we still meet from time to time. The second was a fellow who started shortly after Don left and committed suicide, oh, about a year later. He was having marital difficulties. And then the third they hired was from Berkeley [California] and Boalt Hall [University of California Berkeley School of Law]. He was a year ahead of me. And he did not pass the bar exam the first time, so he was let go, which, again, to some extent, explains why they put me through such scrutiny, I mean 'cause he had just been hired the prior year. And then I became the third black lawyer in the history of the company to be hired.
Speaker 1: So, one, that's a lot of pressure to, you know, to be there, you know--I, oh, I felt pressure; I don't know--you know, having the bar exam hanging over you, but--
Speaker 2: It was.
Speaker 1: --the, but the other thing is the, the hist- the history up to that point had just been people hadn't really stayed that--
Speaker 2: People had not stayed--
Speaker 1: --that long.
Speaker 2: --and then, of course, the one that died tragically, and then the one that did not pass the bar exam was even more tragic in the sense that he had to face leaving.
Speaker 1: So, was that typical at that point in time? Did you know that other legal departments, were they, you know, that large, and, and--
Speaker 2: Nope. At that time, PG and E was one of the few corporate law departments that did almost all of its litigation in house. We did, at that time, about 90 to 95 percent of all the legal work for the company was done through company lawyers.
Story_ID: 570742
Speaker 1: Can you give a little bit of the history of PG and E, you know, just for our sake and--
Speaker 2: PG and E, yes, was formally incorporated in 1905. It acquired a number of companies around Northern California and ultimately they all came together and were incorporated as Pacific Gas and Electric Company in 1905. Territories start in Bakersfield, California, goes up to the Oregon border. It's one of the largest combined gas and electric companies in the nation. It serves one in every twenty Americans, people in this nation. It is a Fortune 500 company. I believe now it's about a 160, 170 on the Fortune 500. In a nutshell, it's one of the major companies in the nation.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now you, this is your first really experience with Corporate America. That's (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Absolutely.
Speaker 1: --that's one thing.
Speaker 2: That is correct.
Speaker 1: And this is, is it 1972 that you are hired, is--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: September 15th, 1972.
Speaker 1: I see, okay. And this is a time that, you know, blacks are just getting into Corporate America. You know, I mean--
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: --this is, you know, I mean soon you will have Black Enterprise. I mean all this is all new, you know.
Speaker 2: That's correct.
Speaker 1: And, and even though, you know, there had been--you say you're the first black, had come on in 19--I think '66 [1966]--
Speaker 2: Sixty-six [1966]--
Speaker 1: --you had said.
Speaker 2: --approximately.
Speaker 1: So, tell me who is in charge of the legal--you know, who's the general counsel at that point? Do you remember?
Speaker 2: General counsel at that time was Fred Searls [Frederick Searls]. The person who actually hired me into the law, law department was Richard Clarke, and he was my first supervisor. He ultimately became the chairman of the board and chief executive officer of the company, so it never hurt to have been (laughter)--and the, the, the, the thing that was so intriguing about--of course, after the bar results came out in November of 1972 and I'd passed, obviously that was a happy day. But the intriguing part was being assigned to Richard Clarke. I found out later that he had a reputation for nobody wanting to work for him and that nobody could ever please him. And so, if you were assigned to him, good luck. And I was assigned to him, and I, you know--he was what you'd call senior counsel at that time, and I thought it was--talking to some of the other white lawyers there, you know, I thought it was a great thing. And one pulled me aside and said, "Do you know what they call him?" "Oh yeah, Dick Clarke." "King Richard" (laughter), King Richard, said, "Nobody can please him. Nobody wants to work with him." It turned out though that Dick Clarke was probably one of the best persons I've ever worked for in my life. He really did teach me how to be a lawyer. He spent a lot of time with me. And indeed, he spent a lot of time criticizing, chopping up your work and all that stuff. But at the end of the day, we were very good friends, and I learned a lot from him, and I did please him. Matter of fact, I worked with him right up until he got promoted and left the, the law department. And we continued our relationship right up until his death about two, two and half years ago--three years ago, even after he had left the position as chairman of the board and chief executive officer. And about, oh, six months before he died we had lunch together. And about three weeks--four weeks before his ultimate diagnoses of Lou Gehrig's disease, he had called me and, and told me about the diagnoses, and that it was really going aggressive, and that he didn't think he was gonna make it. But we remained very good friends, and that's one person that I will always remember and think highly of at PGs, Dick Clarke, because were it not for him, my career in PG and E would have been obviously quite different, would not have been thirty-four years.
Story_ID: 570743
Speaker 1: Now what kind of cases were you working on in that early period with him (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Initially, it started out with what we call--what Dick Clarke [Richard Clarke] always called fender bender cases, you know, personal injury and stuff like that. First case I tried was a case up in Redding, California, which was a redneck area, Northern California, and it was a wrongful death trial. I was the--it was a case that they gave me because it was a loser, you know, wrongful death, little girl died. We know we're liable. You know, the key is to try to keep the liability as low as we can. They had local counsel up there. And so, but it would be a good case to learn how to try a case and practice law. So it was a case called Randall v. Warden [ph.]. I never--I guess it had been going on about three or four years. I hadn't, I had never seen such huge boxes of files in my life. So I started looking through files, and, and, and just trying to make sense of the case, and found it to be fascinating. So I went up to Redding, California, lots of times for depositions, and then ultimately, the trial itself, which to my surprise, the opposing counsel waived a jury trial. He was so certain of his case and just wanted to try to the court, superior court judge named Judge Eaton [Richard B. Eaton], a very conservative judge. And I assume--and he knew the judge. Obviously that was why he had try--'course I did not oppose because having a jury trial of a big company like PG and E [Pacific Gas and Electric Company] up there could be crazy. And so he elected to go to the court. And things seemed to just turn around against the lawyer. I did spend a lot of time preparing for the case, brought in, in some expert witnesses from around the nation, one who had written the code, the book on electricity, Professor Lewis [ph.]--he was out of Missouri--and brought him in. And he taught me a lot about electricity, transformers, et cetera, et cetera. And the opposing counsel I think made some really critical mistakes. He just assumed that he had won the case, and he brought in some experts that were not too sharp, and always forge- remember this is, it's in some articles in a paper. I had him on the hid- the opposing counsel's expert on the stand decided to have a little fun with him, Socratic Method of course--to explain to me the difference between an S type transformer, because the theory was that the transformer had failed. And as a result of that, electricity had gone in, blown out the meter, and set the house on fire. And so, you know, you carry him around and around, and then you finally say now, "Mr. So and So," won't call his name, "could you explain to me the difference between a C type transformer and an S type transformer?" And he sat there dumbfounded (laughter), dumfound- you know, it was almost like basic electricity. And, and since he stammered and, and really couldn't, I simply looked the judge, Judge Eat- Eaton and said, "Your honor, I move that this witness be disqualified." He said, "Granted" (laughter). The other, my co-counsel up there was an older white lawyer. I will call his name. His name is Larry [ph.], and he looked at me in astonishment, "I can't believe the judge is gonna rule that way," and he did. And so after that, things just started going downhill for them. And then the other thing I remember about this was, one day--this is about a weeklong trial. So one black person, he came by the courthouse, courtroom, stuck his head in. He saw me cross examine witnesses and came in and sat there for the whole morning. And when it was over, I walked outside to go to the restroom. He pulled me aside, said, "Brother, I don't know what you were doing or what you were saying, but you sure were giving those white folks hell" (laughter). He was just, he couldn't believe it. He had seen a black lawyer up there, and you know, I said wow, that made my day. But ultimately, the judge did rule in, in our favor and dismissed the case. And when I got back to San Francisco [California], everybody was in a state of disbelief: "How could you have won that case? How could you have won?" So that gave me a little bit of--
Speaker 1: Credibility--
Speaker 2: --credibility, having (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) and standing.
Speaker 2: --having taken that particular case on. That was the, really the first real opportunity I had in PG and E to establish myself as a, as a lawyer, and then lots of things happened after that.
Story_ID: 570744
Speaker 1: So what were some of the lots of things that happened after that then? Because, first of all, did, did, did Dick Clarke [Richard Clarke] help you in the preparation, or that was your own initiative, you know, being given this fender bender case?
Speaker 2: Dick Clarke helped me in the sense that he got the cases assigned to me, telling me all along, "You don't want to be a litigator; you want to get on the business side of the house; you want to help run the company." And of course, I was on the business side the last seventeen years of my career there, seventeen on the legal side. But the next big event after that was the--there were instances where in California cities can vote to take over the utilities and run them themselves. So I was involved in a lot of that and did lots of TV debates and stuff, supporting the company, and did a very incredible job alongside of Dick Clarke. And so that, again, gave me further visibility and credibility within the company 'cause we won them all. And then one of them was the City of Berkeley [California], you know, have you heard the Republic of Berkeley? They passed a law that no corporation could participate in a local election, and then they put on the ballot an election to take over PG and E [Pacific Gas and Electric Company]. So I argued that that was unconstition- tutional. That theory had never been argued in court before, and of course, the court, superior court, ruled in my favor, and the California court of appeals ultimately ruled in my favor in that. And that particular case was cited in a footnote. In the first case it came before the United States Supreme Court on a corporate free speech case called Bellotti v. First National Bank of Boston in 1978 [First National Bank of Boston v. Bellotti, 1978], had a little footnote there. I said ah, I made history, footnote in, in that case--opinion written by Justice Lewis Powell [Lewis F. Powell, Jr.].
Story_ID: 570745
Speaker 1: Fast forward, things began to evolve in California where the California Public Utilities Commission as well as State of Illinois and about twenty other states across the nation had begun to compel utilities to include in the monthly billing envelop the messages of consumer groups. And when--California never passed a statute on that but--until later, after the, the California Public Utilities Commission ordered us to do it. And my position was, having learned a little bit of constitutional law, having defended the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] in some civil rights constitutional law issues, that, that's a violation of the First Amendment. And it took a while to convince the other lawyers in the company [Pacific Gas and Electric Company] and ultimately, the, the senior executives at the company that we ought to challenge this and take it on.
Speaker 2: Challenge the inserts?
Speaker 1: Challenge the order by the commission to put the inserts in, that it was unconstitutional. I don't care what states have passed it. It's still unconstitutional because it's an infringement upon our, on a corporation's right of free speech. And it took a while for them to really understand that position. And so finally, almost like in the Randall v. Warden [ph.] case, they said, "Okay, well, if you really want to waste your time," because they had got an opinion from law professors and law firms from throughout the nation saying that it, it's a loser. You don't--yeah, you just do it, and forget about it because it is constitutional. And so finally, they said, "Okay, well, if you want to spend some time, your time on it, we'll allow you." So, first, I appealed to the California supreme court [Supreme Court of California], which promptly in, in, in one word, denied when I wrote the re- the brief of the California supreme court saying to take it up, because at that time, Public Utilities Commission decision could only be appealed to the California supreme court. And since they denied it, meant that there was no court of record any, anywhere in the State of California, except this administrative body, the Public Utilities Commission. So when the California supreme court denied it, they said well, forget it. It's a real loser. The next step, of course, is a, a writ to the U.S. Supreme Court, which had never decided a case at that time from an administrative law decision without an appellate court decision in between. So they Shepardized, Shepardized, Shepardized and said reluctantly, "If you want to waste your time, you can try and convince the Supreme Court to hear the case. But we know they're not going to hear the case; it's impossible." So since it was impossible, I, I spent about four months in, in 1984, from about June to December, researching, preparing to try and convince the U.S. Supreme Court that they should take this case. And about January, I, I guess I filed the brief right before Christmas of '84 [1984]. And then I believe it was January or maybe early in February we got word out of nowhere that the United States Supreme Court had decided to accept the case for review. And you can imagine that was pandemonium throughout the office and actually across the nation. It was, it was unbelievable that the court had decided to hear this case [Pacific Gas and Electric Company v. Public Utilities Commission of California, 1986]. And of course, every law school--I mean every law firm in the nation descended upon the company to argue the case for the (unclear) United States Supreme Court. And what happened was, again, Richard Clarke interceded and, to a certain extent, and said that why don't we--because there was some controversy as to which law firm should argue--why don't we have this law professor from Stanford [Stanford Law School, Stanford, California] to decide which law firm to argue the case for us. And so the law professor, Professor Cohen [William Cohen]--I don't mind mentioning his name 'cause we turned out to be great friends--came up, and we, about ten of us, in the general counsel's office, sat around. And of course, I was the only one that could explain to him what the case was about so, so that he could make a decision in terms of recommending the law firm, constitutional law firm. And so I had fun with him. I used the Socratic Method on him. And at the end of that conversation he says to the general counsel, "If you want to win this case, it's only one person that can do it for you." He says, "It's that young man." That's how I was selected to argue the case for the company in the United States Supreme Court. And (laughter) obviously the law firms across the nation who had wanted the case were disappointed and again, condemning the company as putting a loser out there, putting this inexperienced lawyer out there to argue the case.
Story_ID: 570746
Speaker 1: A lot of disappointment, you know, among the legal community.
Speaker 2: Yeah, obviously law, law firms are disappointed they did not get the opportunity to get paid all this money for going to the [U.S.] Supreme Court to try and represent PG [Pacific Gas and Electric Company] in a case that they said they were gonna lose in the first place. But anyway, after that, then a number of lawyers in the law department wanted to be on the brief as you decide, you know, it's going to the Supreme Court, I want my name on the brief and all. We tried that for a little while, and finally I went to the general counsel, said it's not working; it's not working for a primary reason. Every time I do a draft, wanted it circulated to them to read and review, and I said they don't even understand the basic issues in the case [Pacific Gas and Electric Company v. Public Utilities Commission of California, 1986]. It's a waste of my time. And Malcolm Furbush [Malcolm H. Furbush], god bless him, he's still alive--sided with me and said, "Okay, I'm taking everybody off the case. It's only you and he," Malcolm, since he's general counsel, he has to be on. And if you look at 475 U.S. Supreme Court 1, you will see Robert L. Harris [HistoryMaker Robert Lewis Harris] argued with Malcolm Furbush on brief. But he did put one caveat in. He said, "Look, I'm, I'm really sticking my neck out here 'cause this is unusual to put this much trust in one lawyer. But you have to collaborate with Professor Cohen [William Cohen]." You remember he was the one that su- suggested me in the first place. "And you all have to sit down and review, say you don't have to send drafts to me. You've got to--you and he have to work together." And then he said, "If you and he disagree on anything, you, after you thoroughly considered what he said and you all can't agree, then it's your final decision as to how it's gonna turn out." So he had stuck his neck way out on that particular case. And of course, the professional and I really never agreed on anything. We've had lots of--I spent a lot of time down at Stanford [Stanford Law School, Stanford, California] with him, and we had lots of dialogue and suggestions, et cetera, but ultimately he would always defer to me. And he had some great ideas and suggestions, which I adopted, for the most part. And then I went over finally to the University of California School of Law, Boalt Hall [University of California Berkeley School of Law, Berkeley, California]. Anytime you go before the United States Supreme Court, you're gonna do a moot court. So I went over and argued befo- before my former professor of torts, Barnett [Stephen Barnett]. The dean of the law school at that time was my par- former constitutional law professor, Professor Jesse Choper, who's well known for his constitutional law work. And the other one had just come to Berkeley. He wasn't there when I was there, from Michigan [University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan]. His, his name was Paul Mishkin. And after I presented my oral arguments to them, and they were acting as the court, Mishkin said to me, he said, "You know, I read all this stuff, and I followed this as a law professor over the years. And I was convinced there's no way the Supreme Court can buy this stuff." He said, "But you've persuaded me that you got a chance." I say yes. And he was the one that really essentially gave me that little bit of encouragement. The dean of the law school, Jesse Choper, we're still friends today. He's sort of tried to help me, like Mrs. Hillegas [Miriam Hillegas]. He said, "Well, Bob, you're a good lawyer. You know, you got good arguments. Just no way in the world the court is gonna buy it. I just want you to know that in advance." So, on the day of the argument, October 8th, 1985, lawyers from the nation had come. The courtroom was full, but my friends got there early, the lawyers and judges from the D.C. [Washington, D.C.] area. So they had gotten there early. I don't know whether you have been to the Supreme Court. The first tier round for the lawyers, they had occupied just about all those seats. And as the case was coming up for review, you sit one table behind the other. And then the Supreme Court justice will know who's gonna argue the case. The next one comes up as to where you sit. If you sit on the right, means you're gonna argue. So the case before us was called, and then the next case you sit right behind. And I sat on the right, and the two white lawyers, Malcolm Furbush and another lawyer from the company sat to my left. Thurgood Marshall looked up and just smiled (laughter), say yes. He smiled. I said hm, he hadn't seen that before, because that, that was probably the first time that they'd seen a black lawyer coming to argue a corporate case. And in this particular case, it was the first time because it was a corporate free speech. The issue had not come up if--before whether or not a corporation has a negative First Amendment right. But the rest of the courtroom was filled pretty much with lawyers from around the nation who had come to hear the argument in the case because it was at that time a real hot case throughout the nation. And I think they were all surprised when they saw a black lawyer in that case. I think--what was I, forty-two, forty-three at the time and looked relatively young then--quite surprised to see a black lawyer up there arguing the case. And it was fun.
Story_ID: 570747
Speaker 1: So describe the experience and the result.
Speaker 2: The experience was great. It never dawned on me that I was gonna lose the case [Pacific Gas and Electric Company v. Public Utilities Commission of California, 1986]. I was convinced that I would win, and I was convinced--and some people say you were lucky; it was you were cocky, or whatever. I had done so much research on every single justice, how they think, what they wrote about the subject, and even before I argued the case, I had predicted who would vote for it and who would vote against it, who would be in my favor and who would not be in my favor. As the appellate, we had lost in California, so we had to go first, and so I went. The, if you look at the transcript, the first question asked of me was from Justice Rehnquist [William Rehnquist], who was not the chief justice at the time because Burger [Warren E. Burger] was. Rehnquist, with his bad back, leans up and say, "Mr. Harris [HistoryMaker Robert Lewis Harris], where did you get this notion that a corporation, like an individual, is entitled to negative First Amendment rights, the right not to speak? We know we've granted them the right to speak, but going so far as giving them right not to speak is, you know, somehow absurd." I smiled. I said, "I got it from Justice Powell [Lewis F. Powell, Jr.], of course," (laughter), and then went on to explain why. And Justice Powell is just sitting there grinning. I knew then he would write the, the, the opinion, and he did write the opinion. The, the, the other justices, with the exception of Marshall [Thurgood Marshall], was pretty much engaged in the--Marshall didn't ask a single question. But they were really engaged in it, the (unclear). As you look at the news articles, all you see is Associated Press said it was one of the most animated [U.S.] Supreme Court arguments in long time before the Supreme Court. I needed, in particular, Sandra Day O'Connor, who was the first woman on the Supreme Court and hadn't been there too long. I knew I needed her vote, and I became convinced I had it when my opponent came up to argue, said I'll go first; he came second. And when she started cross examining him and calling him by my name, I said ah, I must have made a hell of an impression. And I knew he was in trouble, and primary because of the questions that she was asking of him, and he couldn't really respond. So I figured I had her vote as well, so I--and I, and I knew I had Marshall and Brennan [William J. Brennan, Jr.] because of the way that I had argued the case and had set out the briefs, so that government--and, and this shocked a lot of people. A lot of the corporate lawyers and so called experts in constitutional law--you notice I said so called--they knew Brennan and Marshall, the two most liberal justices, would never vote for a corporation. They're, they're probably right if you framed it that way. But I framed the, the issue that they had to answer the question whether or not you were gonna allow government to pick and choose who can speak. Because the only way you can enforce this statute or this order, since the envelope is very tiny, and only so many voices can be heard, which means that the state has to decide who speaks this month, who speaks next month. And then I just, just had fun quoting Brennan and Marshall the case after case after case where they said government has no business picking and choosing who can speak. And the only way that you can rule in favor of the state in this instance is for the state to pick and choose who speaks (laughter). And that was absolutely correct. And, and, and that was what the fatal flaw that most constitutional lawyers didn't quite understand, that Brennan and Marshall were tied to that notion; they were consistent. They couldn't now say, "Well, if it's a corporation, the state can pick and choose." No, they have been consistent. They don't want government picking and choosing who can speak, and you shouldn't. And, and the other thing I said, you--, "If free speech is about free speech, you really shouldn't have to decide," and if you look in the transcript, you'll see this, "you have to look and see who's speaking to determine whether or not that speech is permissible." Speech is a permissible or it is not. So you don't need to look and say oh, that's John Jones speaking; oh no, that's a corporation speaking. You're gonna let John Jones speak but not the corporation. So anyway, they brought in a 5-4, 5-3 decision. Justice Blackmun [Harry Blackmun] recused himself apparently because he owned utilities stock, because when the case was called, he got up and walked out. The opinion was written by Justice Powell and concurred in by Marshall, Brennan, Sandra Day O'Connor, and the chief justice, not Rehnquist, of course, but Burger.
Speaker 1: Now how much time passed between your argument and the decision?
Speaker 2: It was October the 8th [1985]; the decision came out in February [1986].
Story_ID: 570748
Speaker 1: There are a lot of questions about this. First of all, can you put in context what was happening with the utility companies, you know, at that point in time? You had talked about, you know, that there had started to be, you know, different attempts by municipalities to take over, which is a whole different issue. But I'm just wanting you to, to set the stage for what was happening with the utility country- companies, either just in California or around the country. You know, was there increasing regulate- you know, regulation, more groups wanting to, you know, to--
Speaker 2: Yeah, right, and I (unclear), the context in which utilities were existing in the '80s [1980s] really were, were premised on what was happening in the seven- '70s [1970s] with the energy crisis, with oil prices shooting way up, thus, driving up the prices of electricity. And of course, they were not the most popular entities in the nation. So there was a lot of resistance to utilities because of the rise in price and the cost of electricity. So those are factors that were going against utilities at that particular time, which make, make them somewhat unpopular.
Speaker 1: Okay. And you had--who were the most vocal voices at the time against utility companies?
Speaker 2: Consumer groups. In California it was a group called TURN, Toward Utility Rate Normalization [The Utility Reform Network]. A (laughter), a very vociferous lady named Sylvia Siegel, she was really the guru of anti-utilities in California and did a good job. I, I recall specifically after I finished my argument and was going out in the hall--my wife [Glenda Newell-Harris] will recall, recall this as well on several different occasions--she, Sylvia walks up to me, "Mr. Harris [HistoryMaker Robert Lewis Harris], how could you, how could you, how could you argue in support of that utility?" I said, "Well, because I believe that the, that PG and E [Pacific Gas and Electric Company] has a fundamental right of free speech." I think she felt the impact of that particular day as she sat and listened to the argument and had a sense that maybe their side was not gonna win.
Story_ID: 570749
Speaker 1: The reason I--you know, there are not that many precedents sitting--I mean prece- to be involved with a precedent setting case is, you know, really big in the legal profession. So I wanna go back to why you originally thought this, this idea was born of you. So why did you think that you--you know, where did you first come up with this legal theory, and why did you think it had validity?
Speaker 2: Well, it goes back--
Speaker 1: I mean because you said no one--you know, I was--you know, I sort of had this idea, and no one understood it first of all, you know, or thought it had potential.
Speaker 2: Well, I spent a lot of time on constitutional law, having represented not only a company when Berkeley [California] tried to stifle its First Amendment rights in the early '70s [1970s], but also in the late '70s [1970s] with the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] as their volunteer legal counsel in representing them in constitutional law is your First Amendment. It, it really doesn't matter, the First Amendment, as far as I'm concerned, whether you're dealing with an individual or a corporation. A First Amendment is still the First Amendment. And so I had, although not inside of PG and E [Pacific Gas and Electric Company], but outside of PG and E I had considerable experience in representing the NAACP when the police officers association [National Association of Police Organizations] would sue them every time they stood up and complained about police brutality. In other words, they were trying to stifle the right of the NAACP to complain about police brutality. Because if they complained, they slap a lawsuit against them, and of course, if you don't have the money to pay for lawyers to defend you, then you shut up. So it's denying you the right to speak. And the principle to me is the same. So in, in the NAACP cases, we volunteered, the Charles Houston Bar Association, which local black lawyers there in Oakland [California]. I led the team of lawyers to defend them and ultimately received the William Robert Ming award [William Robert Ming Advocacy Award], which is the highest honor of the NAACP, for litigating civil rights issues.
Speaker 1: Now what year was that that you--
Speaker 2: That was in 1986.
Speaker 1: Okay, 1986 on the NAACP--
Speaker 2: On the, for the award of the, the Ming award.
Speaker 1: No, but when was the, when was--
Speaker 2: The cases were, the cases started in 1977--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --nineteen seventy-eight [1978] back in Oakland and in San Francisco [California].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And they were not ultimately resolved until about 1984, '85 [1985]. And when they were finally resolved, then the NAACP recommended me for its Robert Ming award.
Speaker 1: How many, how many total cases were there within NAACP (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) There were, there were two: one in Oakland and one in San Francisco. We represented both, the San Francisco branch as well as the Oakland branch. There were two--
Speaker 1: Now were those--
Speaker 2: --separate actions.
Speaker 1: Okay, those cases, were they held by the federal, or heard by the federal district court?
Speaker 2: Superior court.
Speaker 1: Okay, the superior court (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Alameda County superior court [Superior Court of California, County of Alameda].
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: The cops brought the cases in San Francisco in San Francisco superior court [Superior Court of California, County of San Francisco] and in Oakland in the Alameda County superior court.
Story_ID: 570750
Speaker 1: But back to this, you know, the U.S. Supreme Court case. And the name of that case?
Speaker 2: Pacific Gas and Electric Company v. California Public Utilities Commission, 475, U.S. 1, 1986 [Pacific Gas and Electric Company v. Public Utilities Commission of California, 1986].
Speaker 1: I thought that would bring us (unclear) days too. But the, the thing that I, I want--where was Dick Clarke [Richard Clarke] in this whole thing? Was he still your supervisor, or (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No.
Speaker 1: --had he moved--he had--
Speaker 2: He had moved into the corporate side.
Speaker 1: So he had moved, okay.
Speaker 2: He was the like the number two person at the company [Pacific Gas and Electric Company]. He became chairman and CEO that same year in 1986, shortly after--
Speaker 1: Now--
Speaker 2: --I argued that case--
Speaker 1: Now--
Speaker 2: --or won that case.
Speaker 1: Okay. Was your position--what was your title still? Was it, was--you had moved past senior attorney, or were you--
Speaker 2: Well, we had gotten rid of all of the titles by the time. I was just an attorney in the law department--
Speaker 1: Okay. And--
Speaker 2: --but considered--
Speaker 1: One of the--
Speaker 2: --one of the seasoned lawyers.
Speaker 1: Okay. And why--okay, politically speaking within the, the law department, 'cause politics do play, you know--why do you think you won and got sort of approval to go ahead? Was it because the company was feeling under sie- you know, un- you know, under siege, by the consumer, you know, by TURN [Toward Utility Rate Normalization; The Utility Reform Network], or what--I'm just trying to understand the, the dynamics--
Speaker 2: Well, the company (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) you know, the--
Speaker 2: --was clearly under siege by TURN, and TURN was determined to get into the billing envelope. And as I said previously, the company was ambivalent about it. They really thought that they were gonna have to do it. I was really the only lawyer at the company who understood the constitutional law issues surrounding this by far, because I had started this back in 1973, 1974 in terms of the Berkeley [California] case. So I had far superior knowledge on constitutional law of anybody in the company by far. Matter of fact, it wasn't isn't close. And if anybody in the company was gonna argue it internally, it was no question that it was gonna be me. The issue was never internally. The question was externally. If we go outside, who would we get? So there was nobody inside the company that I was competing against.
Speaker 1: Now--
Speaker 2: They had accepted the fact that I knew more constitutional law than any of them.
Speaker 1: But when you went down to the, the law professor--his name again.
Speaker 2: Was the, professor Cohen [William Cohen].
Speaker 1: Per- Professor Cohen. When you went down there, why did he feel that you were the only one who could really sort of argue the case? Was it--I mean when did you have to try to convince him, first, of your theory--
Speaker 2: Well, first of all, I knew that he did not know nearly as much about the case, even though he was a constitutional law professor, as I did, because I had studied everything about it. So in the process of presenting the case, I simply started asking him all kinds of questions about the case to let him know that I fully understood what the issues were in this case and what it would take for the Supreme Court to rule in our favor. So I just simply had already decided what to do to him, and I did it to him that day. And he came out, at the end of the conversation, he was thoroughly convinced. "I don't believe that there is any other lawyer that understands this case as well as this young man or could present it to the court." And I think he was absolutely correct.
Speaker 1: So at the end of the day, it's not like the, the company invested a lot of effort. There weren't a lot--I mean money, because you didn't have outside legal counsel. They weren't running up bills. It was you. I mean there were (laughter)--
Speaker 2: I saved them a lot of money--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --because I was on staff anyway, and they were not incurring huge legal bills. The most that they had to do was continue to pay my salary and the filing fees in the case before the United States Supreme Court. They recognized ultimately that by going in house they saved a lot of money. The only question was of whether or not they were correct in allowing an in house lawyer to do it versus an outside law firm, established law attorn- firm, with a lawyer who may have been--argued in the court numerous times to go in. So that's the risk that they ran, and the general counsel [Malcolm H. Furbush] really stuck his neck out and stayed with the law professor's recommendation that I argue the case. And he convinced senior management, along with Dick Clarke, that I argue the case, and that was it. So they put all of their eggs in my basket.
Story_ID: 570751
Speaker 1: So the day the case [Pacific Gas and Electric Company v. Public Utilities Commission of California, 1986], you know, was ruled upon in that you said February. Was it--
Speaker 2: February 24th [sic. February 25, 1986], I believe--
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) or 23rd.
Speaker 1: That was a grand day then.
Speaker 2: It was a grand day.
Speaker 1: Okay, so tell me what the implications. What were the results of that ruling in, you know, internally and externally?
Speaker 2: Well, internally the law department [at Pacific Gas and Electric Company] was pandemonium. They couldn't believe it. And the general counsel, Malcolm Furbush [Malcolm H. Furbush], literally picked me off the floor (laughter), because I had--you know, he invested all of his goodwill in terms of allowing this to be argued in house by this inexperienced attorney who's never argued before the [U.S.] Supreme Court. And so he was just unbelievably delighted. So throughout the day there were just meetings after meetings after meetings, you know, talking about the case and dah, dah, dah and dah, dah, dah; it was just pandemonium, and, and across the nation, as you can see from some of the news articles. There's huge news articles from The Wall Street Journal to The New York Times to everywhere--some of them in that book over there, the impacts of this across the nation. And there were written maybe twenty or twenty-five law review articles, all saying Supreme Court came to the wrong conclusion. Of course, what do you expect from them, because they had predicted a defeat in the first place. So it was nationwide impact, and it reversed a number of what, about seventeen, eighteen statutes across the nation. And that was tremendous work. And, and in most constitutional law cases you will see the case standing for that proposition of negative First Amendment rights of corporations.
Speaker 1: Can you, can you just for us describe negative First--you know, the theory behind--I mean just the concept?
Speaker 2: Yeah, the concept is that when the Supreme Court decided in 1978 [First National Bank of Boston v. Bellotti, 1978] that a corporation has a right to speak, which gave it the affirmative right, you can speak, but that does not necessarily mean you have the right to remain silent and not speak. My theory was that, to the extent you carried somebody else's message in your billing envelop with your name on it, whether you liked it or not, you were speaking when you don't want to speak. The company did not want to affirm the message of TURN [Toward Utility Rate Normalization; The Utility Reform Network] or be associated with its message. But by merely putting it in that billing envelope, caused it to be associated with that message. No matter what that disclaimer may have said, it's in the billing envelope itself. So the company was being forced to speak when it did not want to speak.
Speaker 1: You know now, what is, is, is interesting to me is in the tobacco cases, why that theory hasn't played there. Has that been more political, you know, with the warning notices or the warnings on now, on food?
Speaker 2: Well, different, different standard applies there, because there you're going to the health--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --of a person--nothing related to health, and so therefore it is no compelling governmental interest. If somehow this was causing a health condition in people, then the government would have a compelling interest for forcing us to do it. And my theory was there was no compelling interest to force us to do this. Tobacco, yeah, 'cause it's a health and safety issue involved.
Speaker 1: So at the time that this case came out, you had been in the legal department, is that fourteen years?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, approximately (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Two--yeah--
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: --approximately, yeah.
Speaker 1: So shortly, like three years--
Speaker 2: Thirteen years, right.
Speaker 1: --after that you actually ended up moving over to, on the other side.
Speaker 2: I did.
Speaker 1: Okay, so what--I'm forgetting the general counsel's name.
Speaker 2: Malcolm Furbush.
Speaker 1: So Mal- Malcolm Furbush, his, his stock goes up.
Speaker 2: His stock goes up (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Your stock goes up. How large is the legal department at that point, you know, of his--
Speaker 2: Oh, it was probably about fifty, sixty lawyers by then or maybe more--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --had doubled in size at least.
Speaker 1: Okay, so had that--so it had doubled in size from the beginning, but you also had started to use outside counsel more.
Speaker 2: We had started to use outside counsel more starting in the late '80s [1980s].
Speaker 1: Okay, okay. And why was that? Was it that the issues, you know, the issues had gotten more, or just the work, the legal work was--
Speaker 2: No, I think it's the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) as a polit- okay--
Speaker 2: --political decision.
Speaker 1: --it was political, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 570752
Speaker 1: In 1973, you co-founded the Charlie, Charles Houston, Charles Hamilton Houston bar association. So can you talk about how that, you know, why that came about, and who were the, you know, other people in, in the founding group?
Speaker 2: I did not co-found--
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: --the Charles Houston Bar Association. The Charles Houston Bar Association was founded in 1955--
Speaker 1: Thank you (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) by a group of black lawyers there in Oakland [California]. The Charles Houston Bar Association underwent a reformation in 1973; that is, it was a Charles Houston Law Club. And what happened was it changed from a law club--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --to a bar association dealing with the issues of today. I became involved right after law school [University of California Berkeley School of Law, Berkeley, California]. I graduated from law school in 1972. Nineteen seventy-three [1973] I was elected the secretary, to my surprise, of the bar association, the leaders of the, real leaders of the bar association that time: Ben Travis [Benjamin Travis], retired superior court judge, in Oakland now; John Stewart, who's also a retired lawyer now; Clint White [Clinton White], and a number of, of seasoned lawyers in the Bay Area [San Francisco Bay Area, California]. I had worked with Ben Travis as a young lawyer on some other stuff, and he thought that I was a hard worker. So even though I was less than a year out of law school, he in- insisted that I be elected one of the four officers of the bar association. And that's how, essentially, I became involved in the transformation of the bar association starting in 1973.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now you in--let's just, just get some facts straight. Nineteen fifty-five [1955] the club starts.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay, and it starts as a club because it's fewer people, you know (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Charles Houston Bar Association started as a law club to really bring together socially some of the black lawyers, about maybe forty or fifty in the Bay Area at the time so that they could get to know each other and talk about some of the issues of today, but it was primarily for social purposes.
Speaker 1: And then when did it become a bar association?
Speaker 2: It became officially a bar association, 1976.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We started the groundwork for it in 1973.
Speaker 1: Seven- okay.
Speaker 2: We started, we started the transition of it. There's an article on that in the--on the fiftieth anniversary, so it would have been 2005, a huge--I think it's on the Charles Houston Bar Association website on the fiftieth anniversary of Charles Houston Bar Association, explaining how the bar association evolved. I believe I wrote that article (laughter).
Story_ID: 570753
Speaker 1: Okay, I could go on, but I won't go. Okay, you, see, you have a lot of history you can impart on all these. And short thing on Charles Hamilton Houston, who was he?
Speaker 2: Charles Hamilton Housta- Houston was really the father of civil rights law in this nation, Harvard [Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts] educated, really was the person who put the Howard school of law [Howard University School of Law, Washington, D.C.] on the path to overrule Plessy versus Ferguson [Plessy v. Ferguson, 1896]. He trained Thurgood Marshall and a cadre of lawyers that ultimately led to Brown [Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954], even though he died four years before Brown was decided.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's good. So now, with--when, when you came on, was one of the attractiveness--and I'm just wanting to understand this group that formed the bar association, you know, or had formed the thoughts of the bar association. Were you the only one that practiced in corporate law at that time--
Speaker 2: Yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) you know, in a corp- okay. So that was one of your--I mean that you represented a new breed, in some respects.
Speaker 2: That is correct. I represented a new breed, the first time really they'd had a corporate lawyer involved in--actively involved in the bar association and the activities of the bar association as a corporate lawyer coming from a big company.
Speaker 1: And so what were the plans then? What did you sort of--the group state out that you wanted to accomplish, and what were the issues you wanted to--
Speaker 2: The (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) you know, to--
Speaker 2: The, the visionary behind the transformation of Charles Houston Bar--Law Club [Charles Houston Law Club] to a bar association was Ben Travis [Benjamin Travis]. Travis' plan was--vision was to make the bar association representative of most law--black lawyers in Northern California and then to have a mission, first, to change the face of the judiciary; second, to take on important community issues impacting black people, making the bar association a vital part of the community in which that bar association operated. And his passion was to do that. And, and, and, and we figured that the first thing we needed to do was to increase our membership and get substantially all of the black lawyers as members of Charles Houston Bar Association, which we were able to do within about eighteen months, amazingly. We had almost 90 percent of all black lawyers, dues paying members of the Charles Houston Bar Association. We took on some important issues, including police brutality, grand jury investigations of police shootings, et cetera. We challenged the new governor of California in 1974, as he--the campaigning governor as he was running for governor of the state, Jerry Brown, to appoint blacks to the judiciary. And then when he was elected in 1974, we hounded him to death in 1975 on until he appointed more black judges in California than anybody else in the history of California, probably all combined, because we wouldn't let him do otherwise. We, we dogged him, hounded him. He didn't do it voluntarily. He takes great pride in saying that he appointed all these black judges, but he appointed them because we were on him like white on rice.
Speaker 1: Who were some of the judges appointed during that--
Speaker 2: Oh, in addition to Judge Ben Travis, you had Justice Wiley Manuel, who became the first black justice of the California supreme court [Supreme Court of California]; the second black justice of the California supreme court, Allen Broussard; the legendary Clinton Wayne White [Clinton White], who was the lawyer who tried the Zebra cases in California. There's a book coming out soon, soon on the Zebra shootings in San Francisco [California], although it doesn't deal with the trial aspect of it. But Clint White is legendary, and on and on. There are lot of really outstanding black lawyers in Northern California and throughout California that were appointed to the bench.
Speaker 1: Okay. And what would you say during that--what period of time are we talking about? Set (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Nineteen seventy-four [1974] to 1980.
Speaker 1: Eight- '80 [1980]. Okay, so, in that six year period, how--what was the percentage that you increased appointments?
Speaker 2: Oh, (unclear) existing in California, not just Northern California, but throughout the State of California, probably had fewer than black--twenty black judges. So you went from twenty to over a hundred.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's significant.
Speaker 2: It was significant (simultaneous).
Story_ID: 570754
Speaker 1: Now what are you learning, and how is this--I mean, so, first of all, you're a young lawyer, and you are really probably for the first time becoming very civically active, you know, with the bar association [Charles Houston Bar Association]. You had been a probation officer, but you know, you're using--you know, you have your corporate job [with Pacific Electric and Gas Company], but you also are becoming, you know, playing a leadership role through civic activity, through the bar. What are you learning about the community, you know, around you that you didn't know, you know, previously?
Speaker 2: I'm learning that people can have impact. Lawyers can have even more impact. I'm learning more of what Charles Hamilton Houston meant when he said a lawyer is either a social engineer or a parasite on society. So I'm learning that it's important not to be a parasite. So if you're not gonna be a parasite, in the words of Houston, you must be a social engineer, and a social engineer is a person who works to help change things.
Speaker 1: Are you learning also about the history of black lawyers too at that time? Had you been really aware, you know, you know, much before that?
Speaker 2: Sure, you learn a lot about the history of black lawyers. Prior to law school [University of California Berkeley School of Law, Berkeley, California], I don't think--certainly prior to being a probation officer and didn't know a single black lawyer. And prior to law school, had met very few accept the one or two I'd seen occasionally in the juvenile court. So I'm learning about the black lawyers. I'm learning the role that they can play and should play in society and the real impact when they work collectively that they can have. So I was just as a young lawyer, lawyer pleased to be included among that group of highly skilled, intellectual lawyers, giants.
Speaker 1: Okay. And Ben Travis, what--was it Benjamin Travis, right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay. What was his background? Can you talk? There was, you know, just how he had come into the law and his--who his mentors were (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, Ben grew up in New York [New York], had come out to California, attended San Francisco State [San Francisco State College; San Francisco State University, San Francisco, California] and then Hastings College of the Law [University of California, Hastings College of the Law, San Francisco, California] and had been in legal services primarily most of his legal career, San Francisco Legal Assistance Foundation [San Francisco Neighborhood Legal Assistance Foundation] and then ultimately in private practice, and always sort of like a rebel and, and, and with a passion. He's married, you may or may not know, to Attorney Anne Fredd [Anne L. Fredd] here in Chicago [Illinois] and just been a passion of the law all of his life. And, and he drove, to a significant extent, that passion in me. He used to call me, "Hey little brother," little brother this and little brother that. Ben was a dreamer, and, and dreamers tend to need somebody to do the footwork, and I just delighted in doing his footwork, and that's how you learn. And he was always a dreamer, the ideas, and then, "Little brother, make it happen."
Speaker 1: So (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And then any support I needed, I got it from him.
Story_ID: 570755
Speaker 1: So you were young and had something to prove. And you're doing these pro- police brutality cases and, and work, you know, with the NAAC- the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] were really primarily the police brutality, right?
Speaker 2: Mostly (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) At first mostly, okay. Were there any housing or things? There weren't housing. That time had sort of passed, right?
Speaker 2: There were housing issues, and there--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --always have been in California, and will continue to be, but we were not focused on the housing issues. We were focused on the other issues.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now, the other thing that you really got involved with, you know, was Kappa Alpha Psi. And I--well, when did you pled- when did you become a, a member of--
Speaker 2: I became a member of Kappa Alpha Psi in 19--July 1964--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --when I was still a student at San Francisco State--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --University [San Francisco State College; San Francisco State University, San Francisco, California], which I had the pleasure a few weeks ago of being inducted into its hall of fame.
Speaker 1: Congratulations. Okay, so now, how had you come to pledge, you know--
Speaker 2: By accident. When I got to San Francisco State they were recruiting people to come. And you know, you go to, at that days you call them smokers, and you end up--I ended up with the Kappas, and liked what I saw, and ended up pledging and becoming a member of the Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity [Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity, Inc.].
Speaker 1: Okay. You know, I'm gonna use you basically to lay out, since you've touched upon these groups, you know, just some of the history behind Kappa Alpha Psi. Can you do that now?
Speaker 2: Kappa Alphas Phi--Kappa Alpha Psi was founded in 1911, Indiana Uni- University by ten men attending that campus who really thought that there should be a fraternity of men who were committed to education. And you can imagine in 1911 at Indiana University [Bloomington, Indiana], a white campus, they were very isolated. So Kappa Alpha Psi was founded out of that, founded to bring together men who believe in achievement. And those ten men started and initiated its first member, Irven Armstrong, who became the second grand polemarch of the fraternity, and lived to be almost, well, actually 102 years old. And they built the fraternity up to what it is today, well over a hundred thousand members, whose fundamental purpose of it is achievement. Some of its great members have been good friends of mine over the years. I knew several of the founders, including the first member of the fraternity, initiated member, Irven Armstrong. One of my mentors is a past grand polemarch of the fraternity, as I am, Thomas Bradley [Tom Bradley], mayor, former mayor of Los Angeles [California], mentored me as a, as a young lawyer and as a young member of the fraternity. There have been three members of--from California who've been grand polemarchs of the fraternity. We are now at our--we've had thirty grand polemarchs of the fraternity. I was the twenty-seventh grand polemarch. The two others in Cali- one other in California besides Bradley and myself was Randall Bacon [Randall C. Bacon], who now lives in Henderson [Nevada], Las Vegas [Nevada]. As I sa- we've, we've had some very famous people in the fraternity, Wilt Chameon- Chambers [Wilt Chamberlain], Bill Russell, Johnnie Cochran, just lots and lots of noted Kappas. I saw one up on the wall, Ed Perkins [Edward J. Perkins], who is a former, who is a laurel wreath recipient of the fraternity, former ambassador, as you know.
Story_ID: 570756
Speaker 1: And Kappas are involved in just about everything that you can think of, a number here in Chicago [Illinois], Chicago alumni chapter is one of our big chapters. The second fratern- I mean the second chapter after alpha chapter was beta chapter, and beta was the University of Illinois, Champaign-Urbana [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Champaign-Urbana, Illinois], with its founder being none other than Earl Burrus Dickerson [Earl B. Dickerson]. Earl Dickerson was also the former grand polemarch. He was the fifth grand polemarch of Kappa Alpha Psi [Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity, Inc.] and really my mentor, both in the legal field and in the fraternity. I first met Earl Burrus Dickerson at my first convention 1973 in San Francisco [California]. I saw this tall, light-skinned, imposing fair--fellow that I'd seen in the Kappa Journal [The Kappa Alpha Psi Journal] and Kappa history, and I just went up and spoke to him, knowing that he was gonna push me aside. Three hours later Earl and I had become very good friends, and we communicated right up until he died in the mid-1990s, early 1990s. I have tons of correspondence between the two of us, letters and stuff. He was a very close and very dear friend of mine, and he inspired and motivated me. Earl, as I said before, was not only the former grand--fifth grand polemarch of the fraternity, he was also a former president of the National Bar Association, which I also became. And other thing we have in common, Earl argued before the U.S. Supreme Court. He argued Hansberry versus Lee [Hansberry v. Lee, 1940], which came out of Chicago here on restrictive covenants, and I ultimate argued in the Supreme Court. So Earl and I have a lot in common, and, and again, we were very, very close friends, even though he was much older, but he's just, was a tremendous person.
Speaker 2: I didn't know about your relationship with him, and he's, he was a, a legend--
Speaker 1: I know.
Speaker 2: --you know, here in Chicago (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Supreme Life Insurance Company [Supreme Life Insurance Company of America].
Speaker 2: That's right, Supreme Life. What resonated--do you have a, a favorite sort of Earl, Earl, Earl Dickerson story that you'd like to sort of share, an interaction, or something he taught you, or--
Speaker 1: What Earl really taught me was excellence, that, that really you have to be good in what you do. You have to have passion around what you believe. The, the, the, the, the thing that, that he used to say to me most was, "Tell the truth; let truth triumph over everything else, that truth will ultimately prevail, so just stand behind truth; when everything else fail, just be about truth." And he was a very, very learned, very, very passionate man, and a very good friend.
Speaker 2: And you were saying that he was one of the, the--I don't want to say founders, but he was one of the head people at, at Supreme Life Insurance Company (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh yeah, yeah. Remember, he ran that company for a number of years.
Speaker 2: Now, you became of the rest- president of the western regional division of Alpha Kappa of--
Speaker 1: Yes, I became--
Speaker 2: Alpha Psi, sorry.
Speaker 1: I became prov- ultimately became province polemarch at the age of thirty-two of Kappa (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Which is young.
Speaker 1: --Alpha Psi, which is very young. Matter of fact, the grand polemarch at the time out of Louisiana really hesitated, did not want to appoint me primarily because he said I was too young. These older members would not respect and would not follow my leadership, and he was thoroughly convinced of that. And of course, before the day was gone, those older members pulled him off in a room. And when he came out, he came directly to me and said, "Brother Harris [HistoryMaker Robert Lewis Harris], you are the next polemarch of this province." They'd read the riot act to him.
Speaker 2: Because they saw something in you.
Speaker 1: They had supported me.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's right.
Speaker 1: They had--I had come up through the fraternity on their shoulders. I had been the polemarch of the Berkeley alumni chapter [University of California Berkeley School of Law, Berkeley, California] at a very young age, and age had never been a factor in anything I did within the fraternity or within the bar association [Charles Houston Bar Association]. So at an early age I was actively involved, just primarily worked. And as I worked, they promoted me. Even though they were old enough to be my father, they wanted me as their leader. And I would have never been anything in the fraternity were it not for them. The Bradfords [ph.], and Holfords [ph.], and the Sedeths [ph.], they were all my supporters.
Story_ID: 570757
Speaker 1: Now so this is what I'm just wondering. So you are--you have your corporate job [at Pacific Gas and Electric Company], which you're doing, and that has its own, you know, issues.
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: And then you are active, very, very active in these two organizations [Charles Houston Bar Association and Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity, Inc.], right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Correct.
Speaker 1: Okay, in leadership roles.
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: How are you balancing everything at that point? Was it, you know--I mean you hear a lot sometimes about, you know, corporate law jobs that there are, you know--it can be more nine to five [o'clock]. But, at the same time, there are a lot of things that you are doing there. But were there more resources there, you know, or that allowed you to be active in these two, or you just have a lot of energy?
Speaker 2: Combination of all that. There are, are obviously resources you have at a corporation that you would not have had I been at a small law firm or something. But it's a balancing act. You decide what it is that you want to do. You learn how to manage time. There are some people that just waste time. They don't understand effectiveness. They can have a meeting that should be thirty minutes go for four and five hours. You learn how to manage time. And of course, one of the ways--one of the things that impresses people, if you can manage time, they'll say wow, he's effective, well, went to the meeting with him; he conducted that meeting, was over like boom, boom, and we took care of all kinds of business. So it enhances your reputation if you are effective. And so once you understand how to utilize time, you can do lot of things that you didn't think that you could do, and you'll have more time to do it.
Speaker 1: So that was, that, that's, that's essentially what you say--
Speaker 2: My (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) was your answer.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was, it was knowing how to manage time and not waste time.
Story_ID: 570758
Speaker 1: Did the Charles Houston Bar Association lead you to the NBA [National Bar Association] or you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay. So can you talk about that?
Speaker 2: Absolutely. Charles Houston Bar Association, again, as I said, I came in in 1973, treasurer from 1973 to 1975. When Ben Travis [Benjamin Travis] was appointed to the superior court [Superior Court of California, County of Alameda], which meant that he could no longer be the president of the bar. We'd been successful. Remember, Brown [Jerry Brown] became governor in '75 [1975], so shortly thereafter Ben was elevated--was appointed to the court. And of course, he had to be replaced, and they did not replace him with the vice president. They replaced him with the treasurer, who was me, and I became president of Charles Houston Bar Association from 1975 to 1977. I was elected vice president of the National Bar, first time in the history in California they'd ever had a lawyer and to become a vice president of the National Bar, became vice president of the National Bar in Houston [Texas] in 1976, and--
Speaker 1: You said that, that was the first time that they had--
Speaker 2: History of the National Bar they'd had a vice president from--
Speaker 1: Be--
Speaker 2: --California. A number of lawyers from California, L.A. [Los Angeles, California] in particular, had run. Older lawyers, more seasoned lawyers had run to become president--vice president of the National Bar. They had never been elected--1976, three years--little over three years a member of the bar. California, Northern California, Ben Travis and that whole group as well as the rest of the lawyers in California all got behind me as a three--little over three years out of law school. We went down to Houston to take on the power structure of the NBA, which was mainly East and, and Northeast and middle west. Michigan, I was running against a person from Michigan, who had been anointed and was supposed to be the next vice president, and he was upstaged.
Speaker 1: Now how did that happen?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Well, long story, but I'll make it short.
Speaker 1: That was Junius Williams?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Oh, who--
Speaker 2: Junius preceded me.
Speaker 1: Preceded you. I'm sorry. Okay.
Speaker 2: The person who was, I was running against was Stu Dunnan [ph.]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --a nice fellow out of Michigan. He was the--at that time they had fourth vice, third vice, second vice, and then president elect, and president. Well, I didn't run for fourth vice. Stuart was the four vice president, a currently existing, moving down to become third vice. I decided, based on the advice of Elihu Harris, who ultimately became mayor of Oakland [California] and was tat- that time the executive director of the National Bar Association and a very, very good friend of mine, he advised me, since he--and he's also a former member of the California State Assembly, that you don't want to run for fourth vice because the fellow that's running from that out of D.C. [Washington, D.C.], you can't be him. But what you do is go for third vice and never become a fourth vice president and move down. Just shoot in, break into the chain, and go against the fellow from Michigan, and that you can beat him. And he convinced me, and we were able to convince all of California to support us. And because I had a connection in Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity [Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity, Inc.], at that time, remember, I, I was already a polemarch of the western province, so I had some Kappa support from around the nation who knew me a Kappa. And we were successful in Houston to break into the chain as third vice president, knocking off the fellow from Michigan. And I became the third vice president of the National Bar Association, becoming the first vice president ever from the State of California, and had only, had been out of law school [University of California Berkeley School of Law, Berkeley, California] less than four years. Nobody had been able to do that before.
Speaker 1: That's pretty amazing. So--
Speaker 2: It was stunning.
Speaker 1: So what--had you at that point, had you already gone to several of the National Bar Association conferences?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I'd been to everyone.
Speaker 1: Every one (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I started in '73 [1973].
Speaker 1: --since the beginning?
Speaker 2: So I'd gone in '73 [1973], '74 [1974], '75 [1975], and then '76 [1976]. And in '75 [1975] was in D.C., and [HistoryMaker] Arnette Hubbard was elected secretary of the National Bar Association. And as she ran for secretary, I ran for assistant secretary. So they had a position called assistant secretary, so I became her assistant. So I was assistant secretary of the National Bar Association. And again it was the first time they'd had an officer from California, even though it was just an assistant secretary.
Story_ID: 570759
Speaker 1: Let me ask then, you became president then. Do you become president [of the National Bar Association] in 1979?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And are the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) But you have to first become president elect.
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: I became president elect right, five years out of law school [University of California Berkeley School of Law, Berkeley, California], in 1978, in Hollywood, Florida.
Speaker 1: I--
Speaker 2: And then I was installed as president in 1979, served 1979, 1980 as president.
Speaker 1: And then Arnette [HistoryMaker Arnette Hubbard] became president in 1981, is it?
Speaker 2: She was elected president elect in--
Speaker 1: In 19--
Speaker 2: --Dallas, Texas, in 1980.
Speaker 1: Eighty [1980]. I thought it was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And she was in--
Speaker 1: --eighty [1980], but--
Speaker 2: And she was installed in 1981.
Speaker 1: Okay, so where does--wait a minute. I'm--let me just get some clarity here. Wait, I'm trying to think here. Where is William Borders then?
Speaker 2: Borders followed me. Borders was the fourth vice president that I elected not to run against because he was very powerful at that time, had a huge D.C. [Washington, D.C.] delegation, plus he my, my, one of my Kappa brothers [Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity, Inc.]. And I decided not to challenge him for running for fourth and went for third.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So Borders followed me as president, so he served in 1980 to '81 [1981]. He went out in Chicago [Illinois]--I mean in Detroit [Michigan] in 1981. And--
Speaker 1: But wait a minute (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Arnette was installed in Detroit in 1981.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, okay, that's what I wanted to be clear.
Speaker 2: She was installed--
Speaker 1: Okay, so she followed Borders.
Speaker 2: --in August of 19--followed Borders.
Speaker 1: Okay, she followed Borders, okay.
Speaker 2: Borders followed me; she followed Borders--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and Dawson [Warren Hope Dawson] followed her; Dennis Archer [Dennis W. Archer] followed Dawson.
Speaker 1: Okay. Oh wow, so those are always one year terms then.
Speaker 2: One year term.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Now what were you wanting to accomplish--how, how--during your term?
Speaker 1: You mentioned Junius Williams. Junius also was fairly young when he was president. We have this debate as to who was younger, as the youngest president. So I settled that debate by saying, "Okay, Junius, we won't talk about chronological age because we would debate that forever. I became president fewer years out of law school by far than you or anybody else, so." But Junius Williams and I teamed up in, in the mid-'70s [1970s], right, '76 [1976], '77 [1977], in terms of the young lawyers trying to change the National Bar Association. He was actually the founder of the young lawyers section of the National Bar Association, did just an outstanding job. And our goal was to really transform the National Bar Association into an effective national association, speaking out on national issues, taking on national issues that impact black America. And that was our goal, to be more than just coming together on a yearly basis to have a good time, drink, and socialize but to have an impact. And Junius took on a number of issues. For example, he was most noted for taking on the issue of Rhodesia, when Rhodesia was transforming into Zimbabwe, and did, I think, a very good job in that international aspect. My primary focus as the president of the National Bar was to deal with the federal judiciary and internally, within the bar association itself, how it operates professionally, and to start to deal with this whole issue of black America and how it related to each other, black on black crime. You'll see in there that when I was president of the National Bar, we had the first ever black on black crime conference in 1980 in Oakland, California, in this nation. And we took on the federal judiciary in terms of the appointment of more black judges, having learned from California. And as I was indicating earlier, U.W. Clemons [sic. U.W. Clemon] and [HistoryMaker] Myron Thompson from Alabama, if you go back and read Jet, you'll see those were two of the many federal appointments that we supported and took on before the United States Congress. Fred Gray was nominated, but as a compromise--and that's a whole story in and of itself what happened to Fred Gray. And if you want to hear more about what happened to him, read his book, 'Bus Ride to Justice' ['Bus Ride to Justice: The Life and Works of Fred Gray,' Fred Gray]. He devotes a whole chapter on how he was vilified before the U.S. Senate by some lawyers, white lawyers, from Alabama to stop him from becoming a federal district court judge, which he should have been. But anyway, those were the kinds of issues that we were taking on in my administration in the--the 1979, 1980.
Story_ID: 570760
Speaker 1: I have several questions.
Speaker 2: Um-hm. Sure (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) One, I want you to review the history of the nat- National Bar Association, and you know, at what point it was when the new breed sort of took over. So can you do that for us?
Speaker 2: National Bar Association was faun- founded in Des Moines, Iowa, in 1924 [sic. 1925] by several men and one woman and really was founded because the American Bar Association would not allow blacks as members. So for a number of decades the National Bar was the voice of black lawyers. And some of its members included Thurgood Marshall, Charlie Houston [Charles Hamilton Houston], A. Leon Higginbotham [A. Leon Higginbotham, Jr.], and who's who in black America, Damon Keith [HistoryMaker Damon J. Keith], you name it; they all members of the National Bar Association. And the National Bar Associations had, I think over the years, a tremendous impact. But yet when we entered the 1970s, we still did not have the kind of impact that we should have as an organized bar association. So a concerted effort was started in the mid-'70s [1970s] on to really transform the National Bar Association into a powerful organization. We hired an executive director in mid-'70s [1970s]. And the most impactful executive director was our third executive director, Elihu Harris, who was a part--who is now a former assemblyman in the State of California, former mayor of the City of Oakland [California], and now a chancellor of the community college district there in the Bay Area [San Francisco Bay Area, California] called Peralta College [Peralta Community College District]. He had just finished his tenure as the administrative assistant to Congresswoman Yvonne Burke [HistoryMaker Yvonne Brathwaite Burke]. And he took over really at a critical moment in the National Bar Association, when our doors were about to be closed, and really helped us on a solid foundation financially and otherwise to move forward. And he stayed until 1977 I believe, in '75 [1975] to '77 [1977], maybe part of seventy- close to '78 [1978]. Then we had another person in for a very, very short term. And then our current executive director, John Crump, came aboard in 1978 and has been there since 1978. But again, the real story was to put the National Bar Association on the map as an effective organization, taking care of the professional needs of black lawyers. And I think twenty, almost thirty years later, we have come a very, very long ways and have had a very profound impact upon this nation.
Speaker 1: Now and it's a vibrant organization.
Speaker 2: Very, bri- vibrant.
Speaker 1: And, and the thing that was, I wanted to ask you about. Was there any pushback? Because really, you know, we're at the time that you took over leadership and then Arnette [HistoryMaker Arnette Hubbard], and you know, and William Borders; that this is a time that, you know, first of all, you know, blacks in corporate law firms that's, you know, there are more numbers increasing there, though that's still an issue (laughter), but pe- you know, blacks in corporate law firms, people entering into the mainstream bar, the American Bar Association, so was there ever a whole thing where--are, are we at the, the nexus when you guys went into leadership that, you know, it could have gone one of two ways that, you know, it could have said well, that, you know, in the NBA, National Bar Association, is outdated, you know, we don't need that. Let's have our voice in the, you know, in the ABA. Or, you know, and I'm wondering also was there any issue about the NAACP Legal Defense Fund [NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Inc.], you know and mission--just, was there, were any of these things being sort of discussed is what I'm try, trying to wonder, you know, within the context of the National Bar Association.
Speaker 2: Those are always discussions, but they were very quick discussions.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Because of the, what was going on in society, they were answered. They were mostly rhetorical questions and answered themselves. The National Bar Association addressed issues that the American Bar Association would never dream of exec- of addressing. The National Bar Association was dedicated to integrating the federal judiciary. The American Bar Association was not concerned about that. As a matter of fact, the American Bar Association was the primary obstacle. And I wrote a long article about that in the Los Angeles Daily Journal that was published about the American Bar Association and its role in trying to keep the federal judiciary segregated. It ultimately made some changes and it has made some changes. But as long as there is an American Bar Association that is not willing to embrace the problems of black lawyers fully, there will always be a need for the National Bar Association. So we're in a put by--pushback. In terms of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund from [HistoryMaker] Julius Chambers on, they were all and continue to be members of the National Bar Association. We're supportive of the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] and the NAACP Legal Defense Fund. So we've all worked together on many issues th- throughout the nation.
Story_ID: 570761
Speaker 1: Now you, you know, you've held other leadership positions in other, like the National Bar Institute, which came, you know, a few years later in 1982. And then that's the same year that you were also president of the Wiley Manuel Law Foundation. What were those? Tell me where those sort of fit within the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay, the National Bar Institute was founded through the National Bar Association as its 501(c)(3) funding arm. And I did serve as the second president of that organization and actively involved in the National Bar Institute from its inception. The National Bar Institute essen- actually owns the National Bar headquarters in D.C. [Washington, D.C.]. The Wiley Manuel Law Foundation was founded in 1981, '82 [1982], right after the untimely death of the California, California's first black [U.S.] Supreme Court justice, Justice Wiley Manuel, in his honor, as the Charles Houston Bar Association's 501(c)(3) organization. I served as its first president for six or seven years, and again, it's the, the 501(c)(3) funding arm, support arm of the Charles Houston Bar Association.
Speaker 1: Wiley Manuel (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Wiley Manuel Law--
Speaker 1: What was the funding?
Speaker 2: --Foundation.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's a 501(c)(3). It's just like the 501(c)(3) of the National Bar Association or the 501(c)(3) arm of most non-profit organization to raise money that is tax deductible so that you can carry out the mission of the association.
Speaker 1: Well, the main, um, organization, the bar association is really more membership based. Is that what (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Membership based, but you also need to be able to raise money to support membership--
Speaker 1: I see. I see.
Speaker 2: --activities.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 570762
Speaker 1: Now, tell me what are you learning about leadership and managing organizations? I mean at this point, we're talking--maybe about six, seven, I mean I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Actually it was a lot more than that (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Okay. Ten, whatever. But what are you learning about that? Because there's a lot in terms of human behavior. A lot of your work is really being done in the black community. You have--you know, you are definitely excelling in the white corporate world, but you're squar- you know, squarely ensconced within the black community and the issues of the day there. So what are you learning about how to manage change of--and several of those organiza- some were new, you know, and others were, you know, much older. What are you learning about that and how--you gave one instance where you, you know, being a Kappa [Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity, Inc.] helped, you know, you with your election, you know, to, to National Bar Association.
Speaker 2: And being a Kappa helped me also, as well as being a member of the National Bar Association, helped me in my latest endeavor, and that is the grand sire archon president elect of Sigma Pi Phi Fraternity, the Boule. Leadership is, leadership is about the ability to influence others to want to go in a direction that you think you want to go in without them feeling as though they're being pushed. In a voluntary organization, people don't have to do anything. They can tell you to go to hell and nothing you can do about it. So, my philosophy has always been: if you can lead in a non-profit organization, the business world is a snap, because they get paid to follow you. But if you can get people to follow you who are volunteering and not getting paid and then be passionate about doing it, then you know you have mastered the art of leadership. And I, I say that frequently to younger lawyers and people that I talk with in terms of leadership. The leadership is not about commanding anybody to do anything. Even if you are working in a corporation and people are paid, it is not about dictatorship. Leadership is by example, leadership by influence; leadership is about being able to convey a compelling vision where people really want to achieve that vision; and leadership is about getting people to work together to achieve a common goal and then being passion about that, not because you are dogging them, but because they really see the goal, and want to achieve the goal, and willing to work for it night or day, whatever, without pay.
Story_ID: 570763
Speaker 1: And what have you--being involved in so many African American organizations, what do you see as our challenge organizationally wise now. You know, do you see a lot of promise or hope, you know, with them, or do you, do you think that they need to cast a new vision, I guess is what--I'm just, just trying to under- see, you've had--I mean okay, Earl B. Dickerson and you (laughter), but from a--but you've had--not many people see that broad a spectrum.
Speaker 2: The leadership challenge of the day is more about collaboration, not form a new organization, but learning how to work with others versus you versus me; recognizing what are the common problems that we are confronted with as a people, and we are confronted with some very, very serious problems; and how do we work together collectively, not to outshine some other organization, not for the Kappas [Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity, Inc.] to say that they are better than the Alphas [Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity, Inc.], or the Alphas say they're bigger--better than the Sigmas [Sigma Pi Phi Fraternity], or the National Bar [National Bar Association] says oh no, we got the answer, and the medical, National Medical Association is crazy, but for all of us to work together for that common vision that we have identified as something that we need to address. One example, the plight of the young African American male is so serious that we cannot even afford to spend a moment talking about who should lead, who should be the leader of this, and dah, dah, dah, dah. We should all be focused upon the fact that in Chicago [Illinois], for example, fewer than 35 percent of the black boys in public high school don't graduate. Nationally, fewer than 50 percent of black boys in public high school don't graduate. Nationally, in our colleges and universities, 75 percent of black graduates are black women, which in and of itself is great, but the tragedy is only 25 percent are males. So those are the kinds of issues that unless we address, it ultimately destroys the very fabric of the African American communities. And it's all centered around where we started this interview around, and that is education. Education is our passport to the future, says Malcolm X. Tomorrow belongs to the people who prepare for it today, he concluded, third grade education. But absolutely correct, without an education, we go nowhere. Without an education, our black boys will continue to fill the prisons of this nation. Without an education, our sisters will suffer the consequences, and ultimately the entire black community will suffer those consequence for generations to come. So, all of these organizations, it is so critical for them to be working together to, to resolve some of the critical issues, just as we coalesced around, quote, getting our civil rights in the 1960s and '70s [1970s], where all the organizations tend for the most part to be pulling together to pass the Civil Rights Act [Civil Rights Act of 1964], to support Brown versus Education [Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954], and blah, blah, blah and blah, blah, blah. Well, now we have some issues that are actually even more critical than the civil rights rev- revolution. Because if we lose these boys, we destroy our community.
Speaker 1: That's true. That's true, very well said.
Story_ID: 570764
Speaker 1: So I want to talk about the Boule, and I want to go back then to your career and sort of--since we went on the organizational. Do you--you're now the new grand sire archon, is it--
Speaker 2: Elect.
Speaker 1: Elect (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I will take over next year--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --July 2nd--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --two thousand eight [2008]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --as the grand sire archon, which is national president.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's right. And what do you--can you talk first about the history of the Boule? And you're coming on at an interesting time too, you know, some, 'cause the organization is sort of coming out, or it's been outed (laughter), or whatever. So if you could just talk about though the history.
Speaker 2: The (laughter)--it's interesting. The, the Boule, Sigma Pi Phi Fraternity was founded in 1904 in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], which is its alpha chapter. And why I say it's interesting, because I told you about Kappa Alpha Psi [Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity, Inc.], which started in 1911 in Indiana University [Bloomington, Indiana], its alpha chapter, and its beta chapter being in the Chicago [Illinois] area. The beta chapter of the Boule is here in Chicago. That is the second chapter of the Boule. The Boule was founded by men who had already graduated from college--it's not an undergraduate fraternity--men of achievement who wanted to come together in 1904. It was primarily doctors and maybe a couple of M.D.'s and, and, and maybe a couple of dentists to come together, men of, of, of, of like thinking to get to know the best of one another and do collectively that which they could not do individually. And I know there has been a lot of discussion around the history of the Boule and that the Boule is all about having a good time and partying. Well, the Boule does have a good time. The Boule does party. But that is not the real history of the Boule. The, the real history of the Boule has been one of intellect, one of involvement in its communities from day one. For example, one of the founders, Algernon B. Jackson, a physician in 1912, said no professional can rise above the people upon whom he practices that profession, a profound statement, recognizing that no matter what you may achieve individually as a black person, as long as black people are considered nothing, you will as a professional be considered as nothing. So therefore, it is important to work with your people, to uplift, help uplift them. W.E.B. Du Bois, a member of the Sigma Pi Phi Fraternity, the Boule--a lot of black people say, "W.E.B. Du Bois, how could he be a member of Sigma Pi Phi Fraternity?" He was a founding member of Zeta Boule in New York [New York] and served as an officer for many, many years. Now, I will be the first to admit, if you read the history of W.E.B. Du Bois in the fraternity, which I consider to be a glorious history, Du Bois was not given nearly as much support as he should have, as he was outside of the Boule and across this nation as being one of the early starters of the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] and of course the editor of Crisis magazine [The Crisis] for years and years. Du Bois was a man who was way above his time. And Du Bois constantly challenged not only in the NAACP, but he challenged Sigma Pi Fraternity to get beyond complacency and move into the broader field of humanity, helping people. So the lessons from Du Bois are the same lessons that he taught in the NAACP, and that is involvement. So the Boule over the years has been involved, certainly not visibly, as, as an organization. It's not a civil rights organization, never meant to be a civil rights organization, but the Boule does support civil rights activities. The Boule has taken a position. For example, our current grand sire archon, Cornell Moore [HistoryMaker Cornell Leverette Moore], outstanding lawyer out of Minnesota, has championed something I believe firmly in, and that is the plight of the young African American males. And Boules across the nation--we have now 117--many of those Boules are working on projects involving our young African American males, and many are collaborating with others. And one of the things that I intend to do as I take the office is to broaden that coalition of working with other national organizations that are working on these issues, so that collectively we can have some real impact.
Story_ID: 570765
Speaker 1: So the Boule [Sigma Pi Phi Fraternity] is no longer as secret as some people thought it was, although there's quite a bit if you go into the Internet you'll find about the Boule. Matter of fact, our current website on the Boule gives lots and lots of information. One of the articles that I just talked about, a speech that W.E.B Du Bois gave to the Boule, Sigma Phi Fraternity, in 1948. It's published on the Internet, article that was written on that speech currently on the Internet, and, and there's a lot about the history of the Boule. So the Boule I think in year 2007 is really carrying out to a significant extent some of that which was intended by those founders back in 1904, to not only get the--know the best of one another, but to come together collectively and do that which you cannot do individually, which means collab- collaboration.
Speaker 2: Wasn't there another aspect of it that was really the, the concept of the Talented Tenth? Wasn't there--I mean you talk about the Algern- Dr. Algernon--
Speaker 1: Algernon B. Jackson (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) making that speech. But it was also, you know, the perception has been that it was, you know, the people feel, you know, who were the most talented of our --
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --society trying to move the society forward.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and, and, and, and again, I'm, I'm glad you mentioned that because in that website, the Boule's website, you will see that there today. Du Bois explains to a significant extent what he meant with the talent--about the Talented Tenth. And then at the forty-eighth biennial convention, he--I believe it was in Baltimore [Maryland]--he went on to explain more about the Talented Tenth. Well, it was very clear when he spoke in terms of the Talented Tenth at a phase in his life he was talking about members of the Boule really constituting that Talented Tenth. But, as he explained in his speech at that convention, he is not limiting that Talented Tenth to the Boule. But it was just at the time that he originally made that statement, and then he say he wanted to clarify it, and he does clarify it. What he's talking about is a cadre of educated men who do have the intellectual capacity to help move the race forward. Education is still the cornerstone. And if you don't have an education, you're not really gonna be--unless you're Malcolm X, a few individuals who self-educate themselves, but it's still education whether you self-educate yourself or not. You're talking about with, with the lack of education your ability to lead is gonna be hampered significantly. So if you have an education, and we would like to see a lot more people with education, then educated people cannot be enslaved. Educated people are not gonna be standing on the street corner smoking dope. So education becomes really the passport to the future, as Malcolm X say, and that if you get an education, tomorrow is not gonna belong to you. It's gonna belong to those who have an education. And, and that's why it's so important for the Boule and all, especially black organizations, to really refocus on the importance of education, something which is eluding many of our young African American students, and in particular African American males. They don't realize that. Even some believe that being educated is being white, which is con- contradicts everything that I learned as young boy, that black folks needed to be educati- educated, and that education was salvation, that education was really the key to everything, and it was precious. And as my mother [Lucy Luster Harris], my father [Benjamin Harris] used to say that knowledge is something that nobody can take from you, and that is absolutely correct. If you have knowledge, you have power. And that power can really propel you just about anywhere you want to go, assuming that you have a fundamental belief in your own ability to go there.
Story_ID: 570766
Speaker 1: So, in many ways, your, your, your position, you see the work of the black community almost, if I don't get you right, internal and focused on, you know, one of the thing--one big thing would be black boys, but it's an internal thing focused on education. But it's not like fighting an outside enemy in some respects, is it? Do you--
Speaker 2: (Makes a face) There--yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Put it this way: there is always, quote, an enemy out there. There was an enemy when the Constitution of the United States was written, when the founders of this nation wrote in discrimination into the Constitution itself. But if you spend all of your time dwelling on that, over which you have no control, you're really wasting your time. You can always find an enemy out there, and god knows there are plenty. But if you decide to spend your time focusing on what you perceive as maybe this external enemy, then you have very little time to deal with those things that you do have control over.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I don't have control over President Bush [President George Walker Bush]. I do have some control over some of these young black boys who are going astray. I may never be able to straighten out Bush. God knows I don't even wanna spend my time trying because it's hopeless, and I can say that. But I would want to spend some of my time trying to help some of these little black boys, as I was helped in growing up, helping to understand the importance of education, helping to understand the importance of being a man, which is unfortunately missing in many instances, as we walk down the streets of Chicago [Illinois], or San Francisco [California], or New York [New York], especially on the street corners in our neighborhoods, and see the wasted talent.
Story_ID: 570767
Speaker 1: Now let's go back to 1985. And, and I say 1985 because you--when do you go over to the business side after that win [Pacific Gas and Electric Company v. Public Utilities Commission of California, 1986]. You said three more years you stayed in the legal department [at Pacific Gas and Electric Company] right? So--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --that would have been 1988.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And, and you know, Dick Clarke [Richard Clarke]--you can't--you also see--let me just say this, that you can't be general counsel.
Speaker 2: Right (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right, okay.
Speaker 2: I would never become general coun--
Speaker 1: General counsel.
Speaker 2: That, that wasn't in the cards.
Speaker 1: Right. So, and the--Dick Clarke's, you know, I'm sure he's still, you know, was still a constant presence, but his words or advice about getting on the business side, because in a company that's where all the decisions are really made--
Speaker 2: Right--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --right, absolutely.
Speaker 1: So, what, tell me what happens then.
Speaker 2: Well, Dick Clarke never lets up. If you knew Dick, when he was on something he's like a pit bull, just never let up. So he continued to press and chat with me about leaving. And then he--okay, I'll think about it. And then he talks to the HR [human resources] people, and then next thing I know, I'm offered an opportunity to go off to Harvard Business School to do the Advanced Management Program in preparation for transition in from the legal side to running a major operation on the business side. So in 1988, August of '88 [1988], I went off to the Harvard Business School's Advanced Management Program from August through November back in Boston [Massachusetts], and completed that course, and came back end of November. And a month later I was named division manager in one of our major operating divisions in the East Bay [San Francisco Bay Area, California].
Story_ID: 570768
Speaker 1: So you, you, you in 1989 were promoted to PG and E's [Pacific Gas and Electric Company] central division manager, okay. Of what region?
Speaker 2: It was called the central division.
Speaker 1: Okay. And how many employees? What are you doing?
Speaker 2: There were about five hundred employees. At that time the company was divided in divisions, geographic divisions, so I was responsible for the entire operation of that division, which covered the cities of Oakland [California], Piedmont [California], Emeryville [California], and Alameda [California].
Speaker 1: How did you like that?
Speaker 2: It was different. It was the first time that I had responsibility for managing a large group of people, and it was on the operating side. I had no experience stringing electrical wires or digging ditches to lay gas pipelines or any of the operations. The only thing I knew was about what I'd learned at Harvard University [Harvard Business School, Boston, Massachusetts] in terms of how do you lead an organization, and that proved to be good. But the other ace in the hole was the fact that I had already been actively involved in a number of non-profit organizations. And I indicated early, if you can run a non-profit organization where people ain't getting paid, and they will follow your leadership, then whatever leadership skills you are using, whether it's in Kappa Alpha Psi [Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity, Inc.], or in the National Bar Association, or in Charles Houston Bar Association, try those same leadership skills, and you'll probably get good results. So when I took over as the manager of that division in 1989, I was a full division manager in four years. No person had lasted--and I was the first black--and no person had lasted more than one year. They were throwing them out every year. It, it, it was the most integrated of all the divisions within the company at that time. It was something like twenty-eight divisions. And it was the toughest division because it was in the middle of Oakland, which was the most integrated city in its operation at that time. So it was clearly one of the toughest divisions. And I don't think, other than maybe Dick Clarke [Richard Clarke], most people thought that I would probably be gone within a year, but it didn't happen.
Speaker 1: You, you lasted there five--was it (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Four years.
Speaker 1: Four years.
Speaker 2: And then voluntarily left.

Speaker 1: Now what did you learn from that experience, and what was happening with that whole area? U- utility regulation and, and, and the operation of (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, what I learned from that was essentially that the same principles that you use in non-profit organizational leadership, leading people, leading people, whether it's in the business world or in the non-profit world, and employing those skills made it much easier for me to relate to employees and for employees, even though they knew I was a rookie and didn't know what in the hell I was doing, but they rallied around and accomplished things that they had not accomplished before--big issues, two big issues. The--within six months, after seven months after being there, or eight months after being there, the Loma Prieta earthquake occurred, which mean many of our facilities went down. So that was a crisis of leadership in and of itself. We were able to do well, even though brand new on the job there, with restoring power, getting the facilities back up, but nothing spectacular because that was happening around the system. And other division managers did equally as well. Then two years later, in 1991, came the ultimate test. We had one of the largest urban firestorms in the history of the company [Pacific Gas and Electric Company], in the history of United States, actually when Oakland Hills [Oakland, California] caught on fire, as you saw throughout the nation, which presented a challenge unique in, in the company's history in terms of restoring power and gas back to that area. And ultimately, since that was my area, it fell on me, the whole operation, to, to do that. And fortunately, Dick Clarke [Richard Clarke] again was the CEO, and he came out right after the fire was put out. We toured the area, and then he made it clear that even though we had this major disaster, that I was still in charge and my responsibility to get the facilities back in place. Well, we did. We, we did something that no other division had done and that was the quick restoration of gas and electric service unprecedented--. The best estimate was take three to four weeks. We did it five days.
Speaker 1: How did you do that?
Speaker 2: People, people.
Story_ID: 570770
Speaker 1: The vice president, corporate communication had instructed me specifically not--well, they--first of all, I must admit, they entrusted me with the news media, which was good. And, but one thing I was not to tell the news media was when power would be restored, because you set those expectations out there, they can't be met, and then, you know, it just causes more problems. So under no circumstances do you give a date when power would be--you know, something nebulous, like maybe a couple of weeks or so. If it comes back on sooner, it's a surprise to everybody. My people, my direct reports, which, you know, the gas and electric superintendent, the general operations manager, the market, all those people, customer service people, on about that Tuesday--the fire ended on late Sunday night [in Oakland Hills, Oakland, California]--we got together, and they convinced me that they could have everything ready to go by the end of workday on Friday. So Channel 4 [KRON-TV, San Francisco, California], Channel 5 [KPIX-TV, San Francisco, California], they had this big news conference at the service center out in Oakland [California]. And that service center and one of the smart reporters, "When will it be back up?" And I said, "By the end of the day, workday on Friday, October 25th," which (laughter)--and you can imagine, soon as that news came--conference was over, phones ringing off the hook from corporate. "What in the hell?" (Makes noise) And then and finally said, "What possessed you?" And I answered. I said, "My people; they told me that they can do it." And he said like, "You stupid idiot, and you believed them?" I said, "Yeah," (laughter). "I believed them." I said, "Yeah, I believed them." And guess what? (Gesture) Not only was it back up by the end of the day on Friday, but the Tribune, Oakland Tribune--I don't know if you remember Bob Maynard [Robert C. Maynard], the first black editor of the Tribune. He did a story on it, and they said all of the responses from the water company, the sanitary, every company in the City of Oakland [California], et cetera, said there was one company that stood out, and that was Pacific Gas and Electric Company, and they get an A plus. I say yes. They did a tape. Matter of fact, there's a tape on that, on that whole firestorm that the corporate communications had did, and it was a very powerful tape. Matter of fact, they show it from time to time in terms of leadership, how do you rally and get employees to do the impossible? And so that was just one of those stories where I wish I could take the credit for, but it was my people. All I did was provided the leadership, empowered them to do what they said, and they, they convinced me to do it, 'cause I couldn't do it. And they did it, and that's what leadership is all about--
Speaker 2: But how (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) selecting good people and then allowing them to do their job.
Speaker 2: But how did you actually--I mean because it's people plus it's, it's resources. So--
Speaker 1: Resources.
Speaker 2: --you're saying that the resources were all made available, but--
Speaker 1: Resources were there. Resources--we had crews from around the system. Resources were there. The question was whether or not you could coordinate those resources to make it happen. And the people were convinced that they could do it. There's no reason for me to disbelieve them. Why would I? They know their jobs. They know what they've been doing. They can do it, and they said they could do it. They assessed the situation. They convinced me that they knew what they were doing, and I believed them, and I trusted them, and they did it.
Speaker 2: Right. You have an angel guiding your path. (Laughter) Some people would say.
Speaker 1: It could have gone south--
Speaker 2: It could have gone (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) just as the Supreme Court [Pacific Gas and Electric Company v. Public Utilities Commission of California, 1986] could. But at some point you really do have to just put trust--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --in the situation and go with your best instinct.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: And sometimes it'll prove to be wrong.
Story_ID: 570771
Speaker 1: In 1994, you dis- you are promoted to vice president of community relations.
Speaker 2: Correct (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now, you--is this a position you want and why?
Speaker 2: Yes, I wanted the position. And I wanted it because it would give me an opportunity to really relate to the communities in which we operate. Hey, I've been doing that off and on for most of my career, from the law department on, involvement in the bar association, involvement in A- NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], et cetera, et cetera, so it's now, it's just like throwing the rabbit in the carrot patch.
Speaker 1: Okay. So now didn't the, wasn't--what were the issues that you were dealing with, you know, during that time related to the community? Was one of them the Hinkley scandal? Did that--
Speaker 2: That came later.
Speaker 1: That came later.
Speaker 2: The Hinkley situation came later when I was vice president of environmental. Hinkley--
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: --was an environment issue.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And it surfaced while I was--I was the first environmental officer of the company, appointed in 1998, and that's when the Hinkley issue came, a couple of years later.
Speaker 1: I thought it came in--it wasn't 1993?
Speaker 2: No. It, the lawsuit--
Speaker 1: Wasn't--
Speaker 2: --was filed, but the issue really surfaced when 'Erin Brockovich' movie came out in, in, in 2000 with Julia Roberts.
Speaker 1: So you're saying that it sort of kept quiet--
Speaker 2: Oh, it was (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) all that time.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, there was no--
Speaker 1: All--
Speaker 2: --no publicity about that at all. It was a quiet case and the loss--and the law court said, we had already settled back in 1993, this 2.--was it $93 million or something anyway. Maybe it's two hun- $233 million [sic.] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Why don't you describe what happened.
Speaker 2: Well, it, the Hinkley case, as you probably saw, which partially true, from the movie, 'Erin Brockovich' involved depositing certain chemicals in the soil down in Needles, California, where it's 121 degrees today I understand. But at that time there were no environmental regulations concerning how you disposed of the water. So the water was put into a pond, and it soaked into the ground, and ultimately it hit into the water stream. And part of that solution coming from lubricating the compressor gas station was hexavalent chromium, and that went into the water supply. And as a result of that, some people claimed that they were ill and ultimately sued. And we settled the case for about $233 million around 1993. And that was essentially the end of it, although there were some pending, other pending lawsuits. And then the movie, 'Erin Brockovich' came out, using the name of PG and E [Pacific Gas and Electric Company], not disguising it at all. And of course, Julia Roberts won best actress for portraying Erin Brockovich in that particular movie. So that's how the nation became aware of the Hinkley case.
Speaker 1: So you had to kick into motion in the position that you, you were in at that point--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) 'cause there's a lot of community fear--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah
Speaker 1: --at this point.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, it was a whole movie (laughter). It was a whole movie around that. But, but remember, I started in 1994 as vice president of community relations. And one of the things that I wanted to do as vice president of community relations was to continue to position the company as a responsible entity. So by the time 2000 came with Hinkley in a movie, there was really no real negative reaction against the company. Most people would say that well, maybe they were that way then. Let's assume that they were, but that's not how they are today. So nobody's gonna be angry at you because you used to be an alcoholic, and now you've joined the church and become a preacher. They forgive you for being an alcoholic. Now you see saved. So that's the theory behind it. And nobody's gonna remember it or, or hate you because at one time you may have done something bad, but they're gonna judge you primarily on what you are today.
Speaker 1: So what, what were the things that you did in that, you know, in that six year period then, that you put in place--
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: --you know, at--to make PG and E, you know, a good corporate citizen?
Speaker 2: Well, the theory was we wanted to become a neighbor of choice. And--
Speaker 1: Because there was competition coming--
Speaker 2: Well, competition coming, et cetera, et cetera, and so you want to be perceived in a favorable light. So if people decide--have to vote on whether or not to give up PG and E and allow the city to give it its electric service, we want them to say oh no, we like PG and E. We feel good about PG and E. So we were involved in all kinds of community activities, involvement in community economic development, et cetera, and, and just really integrated into the community in which we operated. So when people thought of PG and E, oh, that's my neighbor, not my enemy. And so I was not at all surprised when there was no--I think I got one letter reacting to PG and E as a result of 'Erin Brock- '--'Brockovich,' one letter. So, that's what you want. And then the fellow that wrote that letter was sort of misinformed. And I was able to write him back and give him the facts, and I didn't hear any more from him. But that's what you want. You want a reputation where people perceive you, what am--what are you doing today in terms of being a good citizen, in this case a corporate citizen? And that's what they are mostly like judge you on.
Story_ID: 570772
Speaker 1: Now when you took over, then you moved up to vice president. You went from community affairs, which is not really so much line item right there, but how large was your budget?
Speaker 2: I was division manager and then to community (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right, right, right.
Speaker 2: --vice president of community relations, then vice president of--
Speaker 1: Environmental--
Speaker 2: --environment affairs. The community relations budget at that time was probably ten, twelve million [dollars] or so.
Speaker 1: Okay. And then when you--why did you want this position with environmental relations? Why did you seek or take it when it was offered (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, the con- well, the CEO offered it to me, and they were establishing a new department called environmental affairs. And he said that he thought that I would be the best person for it, my legal background and my understanding of community issues, et cetera, et cetera. Even though I'd had no real experience in environmental, he said but you'll do a good job. And so he recommended to the board of directors of the company [Pacific Gas and Electric Company], and I became the company's first environmental officer. And, and now the company is considered one of the great environmental companies in the nation.
Story_ID: 570773
Speaker 1: So now during this time, or let's say--I just want you to--the, the issues, so there have--there was an issue of environmental safety, you know, what, what electric companies, what the, you know, the waste (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Environmental responsibility--
Speaker 1: Right, what it was--
Speaker 2: --absolutely.
Speaker 1: --was, was doing. But there's also, you know, nationwide has been an issue of nuclear power plants, you know, and their role and safety or not, you know, safety. And then we also--you had the whole rolling blackout issue, you know, in 2001. Can you talk about that, you know?
Speaker 2: Well, nuclear power, PG and E [Pacific Gas and Electric Company], of which I retired from January 1st of this year [2007], we've operated Diablo Canyon [Diablo Canyon Power Plant, San Luis Obispo County, California] since it opened up in 1986, '87 [1987] very safely, been given accommodations by all kinds of agency for its operations, so it has been no problem there. In California we did have a crisis in 2000, 2001 with the shortage of enersy- energy supply that came on as a result of, quote, deregulation legislation passed in California, deregulating the elec- wholesale electric market. And as a result of that, Enron [Enron Corporation] and other companies went wild in terms of manipulating the market and stealing. And they ultimately got caught, and as you know, went bankrupt. Enron, in and of itself, went bankrupt. But that was due primarily to behavior, predictable behavior on the part of some people who take advantage of situations. If you have a market that is unregulated with a commody- a commodity that people can't get enough of and can't live without, there's always the temptation to exploit. That's why you have regulations in the first place. So by deregulating that, it was sort of like putting the fox in the chicken house and asking the fox to govern himself. Foxes eat chickens--
Speaker 1: Now wa- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) can't help it.
Speaker 1: Why was it deregulated? Why was there a push and under what administration had there been a push to deregulate? Was that under the Reagan [President Ronald Wilson Reagan]?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: What--
Speaker 2: No. That was under the, I believe it was under the Wilson [Pete Wilson] administration--
Speaker 1: Wa- okay.
Speaker 2: This was local. This was in the California.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Wilson administration, where the deregulation actually occurred in 1996. And then when Gray Davis took over is when the crisis happened.
Speaker 1: And then that was the end of him. He couldn't anything (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) He got, he, he--yeah.
Speaker 1: He could do anything after--
Speaker 2: Well, he couldn't do anything before that because he could never make a decision. And when you have an indecisive person in a position like that and in a time of crisis, they gonna look even worse. And of course, he was recalled, as you well know. He was recalled and current governor--
Speaker 1: Right, Schwarzenegger [Arnold Schwarzenegger].
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Who's--so, so you--in that, how are you dealing with those issues, and what are the issues that are predominant, you know--
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: --that, that--because first of all, the, the, the public has no faith, right, in what has happened. And they don't even understand how this even happened. And then you have this rolling blackout issue, which basically blackouts are--
Speaker 2: Well, they weren't that extensive.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: There were some. In Northern California, our territory, there were actually very few. The big impact was the, we filed chapter--of course the price went way up, and we filed chapter--
Speaker 1: Because of the Enron?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Because of manipulation of the market, market. We were limited in terms of buying at, I think it was five cents a kilowatts and having it sell at thirty. How long you gonna stay in business? Buy at five, sell at thirty. I mean just the reverse (laughter).
Speaker 1: No, you were buy at thirty and sell--
Speaker 2: Buying at thirty, selling at five.
Speaker 1: Right, 'cause you were--
Speaker 2: So you can't--
Speaker 1: --regulated, but you had bought--
Speaker 2: But we had to pay market price.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: It was thirty cents, and we're selling at five, so buying at thirty, selling at five. It's a matter of time before you go out of business. So we did cha- declare a Chapter 11 bankruptcy [Title 11, United States Bankruptcy Code] and ultimately came out of bankruptcy--
Speaker 1: In a very short period (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah--
Speaker 1: --of time--
Speaker 2: --about three years a period of time, three or four years, and did quite well as we came out. And stock went down something like $6.50 a share. A few weeks ago it was up to fifty dollars a share. Today it's selling about forty-five dollars a share, so, company did quite well. It did a good job of coming out a Chapter 11 bankruptcy.
Story_ID: 570774
Speaker 1: So, you retired you said a year ago (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) January 1--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --of this year [2007].
Speaker 1: This year. So where are you in your life right now? I mean I, I keep thinking--well, answer that question first.
Speaker 2: Having a good time, enjoying life, doing all the things that I wanted to do but never had enough time to do them. So I can now, I now elect to do those things that I just really enjoy doing and, and no longer in the fast lane.
Speaker 1: But, and you're entering into the head of the Boule [Sigma Pi Phi Fraternity] pra- you know, presidency.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: That's right. Being a retired person, so you will have time to really dedicate to that (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh yeah, I have a lot more--
Speaker 1: Now--
Speaker 2: --time than if I'd stayed.
Speaker 1: But, I can't help thinking about your, what I could consider amazing story, you know, how you started. And you say your mother's [Lucy Luster Harris] still alive--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --right? Your father [Benjamin Harris] died.
Speaker 2: Died in 2000.
Speaker 1: Okay. And you've been married how, how many years?
Speaker 2: My second marriage, twenty-two years.
Speaker 1: Okay. When we--when you look at that--your wife from your second marriage, her name?
Speaker 2: Glenda [Glenda Newell-Harris].
Speaker 1: Glenda. When you look at your, you know, humble beginnings and think--you know, I kept thinking about the image of either, you know, the picking of the cotton or the chopping the cotton, you said, and the hay, the baling of the hay, and the person that you were the day when you said--you know, you had just that hay, and your mother tells you your sister [Jean Harris Blacksher] has called--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and where you are now. What do you think in terms these--how many, many years, fifty something?
Speaker 2: Forty-seven since I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Forty-seven years--
Speaker 2: --left Arkansas, right.
Speaker 1: --that, you know, that have passed. Could you have judged the, the path that your life took?
Speaker 2: No, no. I have taken every step, one step at a time, not looking to achieve something else, but rather to do the best job that I could do or accomplish as much as I could accomplish as I took each step. And the next step was something that I had never planned.
Story_ID: 570775
Speaker 1: And in that, what do you, when you sort of look back over your life, what do you--two questions I have. Then I, I have some others. But I want to know what you want to be remembered for if, you know, when--and you're still very vibrant, looking like you're fifty (laughter).
Speaker 2: Thank you.
Speaker 1: You're welcome. What do you, what do you want to be remembered for you think?
Speaker 2: E- well, essentially as a person who not only believed in himself but was genuinely concerned about others and was willing to go that extra mile to extend whatever I could extend to, to help those who wanted to be helped. And I want to be remembered as a person who really wanted to make a difference in the lives of others, not to be remembered as some person who achieved this or achieved that but a person who's achievement, most significant achievement, is to be of influence and assistance to others, and that those whom I may have helped over my lifetime will remember me as someone who really had an influence upon them.
Speaker 1: And your legacy?
Speaker 2: Legacy is one of dedication and service.
Story_ID: 570776
Speaker 1: And when you look at the black community, what are your hopes and concerns for that community?
Speaker 2: My hopes are that we will fulfill the dream of Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.], Thurgood Marshall, Charles Hamilton Houston, the dream of being the very best, the dream of achieving real equality and having an economic impact. My fears and concerns are that we may have wandered, to some extent, off that path today and that we may not necessarily be headed in a direction that is going to achieve those dreams. And there- therefore I'm very, very, very much concerned about the education. And, and I still consider to be, consider education to be that key, that if we don't deal with that, everything else becomes relevant, or irrelevant.
Speaker 1: And do you have any answers or thoughts about why we veered off the, off the path?
Speaker 2: Well, you never know. That, that--I mean one could pontificate all day and, and come up with theories as to why we may have gone off. And I'm not certain whether there is any particular reason why we have. But, but I do know that one of the factors is that we have not put as much focus--and again I'm back to that continuing theme--on education as we should have. We've allowed our children to adopt our fundamental belief--too many of our children, oh, there's some of our children just doing great, fantastic. But too many, the belief that education is not important. So, and, and then secondly, we have veered somewhat from the religious background, religious training, where we were taught values. We were really taught to believe that the first--that the Ten Commandments meant something. Even though we may have done a few bad things, there was always something there telling us thou shall not steal; thou shall not kill. But nowadays, some of our children, there's nothing there to tell them anything. So you look at them the wrong way, they shoot you. And say, "Why did you shoot that person?" "He dissed me." "What do you mean, dissed you?" So anyway, so I think education and spirituality become two components that we may have allowed to steer off course, and as a result of that, we're losing a lot more of our younger people than we should lose. We've had through the affirmative action years tremendous progress in terms of black middle class. But now you see even some of the children of black middle class not identifying in the education system but finding excuses as to why they are not achieving when there should be no excuse.
Story_ID: 570777
Speaker 1: And anything else you want to say, sir?
Speaker 2: No, except that I think that when you think about telling stories, you think about history makers and the importance of understanding our history. Nothing can be more important than dealing with history. Because if you don't know history, you are going to repeat it. And HistoryMakers [The HistoryMakers] I think really gives us an opportunity to see ourselves as people, especially for our young people. It's not for us, who've already traveled that road. It's for our young people to see how their parents got to where they got, in other words, how we got over. And we didn't get over by just sitting around with an entitlement mentality, that we got over because we fundamentally believed what Frederick Douglass said when he said, "You may not get all that you work for in life, but you certainly are gonna work for all that you get." And, and, and, and some of our young people really don't understand that. They don't understand that it is necessary to burn the midnight oil. They just assume that you go to class, you see these other people that are doing well. Oh, well, they were just smart. No, that's not it. They have studied like hell. And if you do the same thing, you can accomplish the same thing. So get rid of that and, and, and just be prepared to spend the midnight oil; be prepared to put in the time and effort and never, ever, ever give up, and always remember what I said earlier when I quoted Marcus Garvey, "If you have no confidence in self, you're twice defeated."
