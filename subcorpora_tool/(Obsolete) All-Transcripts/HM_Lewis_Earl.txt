Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: Including--I don't know if you have a middle name.
Speaker 2: I do not.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That's fine, okay.  State your name and spell it for us and give your date of birth.
Speaker 2: Sure.  My name is Earl Lewis, Jr., E-A-R-L, L-E-W-I-S, and then Jr., J-R.  I was--birth date, November 15, 1955.
Speaker 1: And I'd like to have today's date?
Speaker 2: Today is October 18, 2013.
Speaker 1: And our location?
Speaker 2: Our location is the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, 140 East 62nd Street, New York [City], New York.
Speaker 1: And your occupation?
Speaker 2: I am the President of the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Would you describe yourself as foundation president, I think, and scholar?
Speaker 2: Also as a scholar.  I, I still hope to be able to continue to write, and, and we'll see (laughter).
Story_ID: 105993
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, we, I, we have five People magazine--ish questions, excuse them but it's our tradition.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I'd like to have your favorite food?
Speaker 2: Ooh, (laughter) that's an interesting question.  My favorite food, I'm a kid who grew up Tidewater, Virginia so one of my favorite foods is steamed blue crabs.
Speaker 1: Favorite time of year?
Speaker 2: Really, I love fall.  As we move from summer into sort of the cool and crispness of before we get to winter.
Speaker 1: Favorite time of year?
Speaker 2: Favorite--
Speaker 1: Oh, I'm sorry, sorry.  You just told me.  Favorite color?
Speaker 2: My favorite color is blue.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Favorite, favorite place to vacation?
Speaker 2: I actually love going home.  So we have a family house in the southern tip of Virginia Beach [Virginia] on a national wildlife refuge, on the Back Bay National Wildlife Refuge, and so if I could do anything, I would go out to our house, look out at the water and just commune with nature.
Speaker 1: And favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Favorite phrase or saying.  Well, I think one's, one I actually adopted a few years ago and learned from my former colleague at Emory University [Atlanta, Georgia], James Wagner.  And Jim used to always remind me and himself that while we have these titles "we serve as," rather than "we are."  And so we serve as president, rather than being the president and it helps to remind you of both the core values and who you are.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You know I was just thinking, when you were talking about your favorite place to vacation you know--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --you're in New York [New York City, New York] now.
Speaker 2: And--
Speaker 1: So (laughter)
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: So are you gonna be forest, are you gonna be at the [Martha's] Vineyard [Massachusetts], or are you gonna be up in, gosh what is it?  What's (unclear)
Speaker 2: The Hamptons?
Speaker 1: The Hamptons, yes.
Speaker 2: I experienced the Vineyards for the first time this past summer.  A friend who had been trying to get us to come and visit, we managed to drive up and so, we'll get there and the Hamptons and probably over time.  But I'm still a Virginia kid in that certain way and it, there are ancestral reasons for returning to Virginia.
Speaker 1: That's right.  And you never know you may turn the tide here (laughter).
Speaker 2: Exactly.  Precisely.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 105994
Speaker 1: So, I'd like to start out by asking you about your father.
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: And then I'd like to, you know, what you know about his background, since you're a junior.
Speaker 2: My father was Earl Lewis, Sr.  He was born in Tidewater [Norfolk, Virginia on August 1923].  He died at the age of thirty-eight in 1961.  I was five years old.  He was buried on (unclear) my sixth birthday.  And so my memories of my dad are few.  He worked, still the segregated South, and I can still remember seeing him in what was then the segregated wing of Norfolk General Hospital [now Sentara Norfolk General Hospital in Norfolk, Virginia] in 1961.  Well, his kidneys failed and this was before the perfection of the dialysis machine, and so there was very little treatment and as his body retained fluid, you know, eventually his limbs would swell and it was a slow, painful death in the early '60s [1960s] of dying from kidney disease.  And so what I remember, both of the renal challenges that he had but also of my childhood was of a man who actually bore a striking resemblance to my brother [Rudolph Lewis].  So there's this interesting way where my brother, who is two years younger, looks a lot like my dad.  A little darker but a lot like my dad, both in physique and height and all.  I was the shortest of the group.  My dad was about six feet.  My brother is six feet.  And for whatever reason I was more the size of, a little taller than my maternal grandfather.  So it, my dad was a guy who (laughter) had a family joke, he would sometimes have an impulse and he would act on it.  So my, he would tell my mom he going out to the grocery store and he would come back with a new car (laughter).  And so somewhere between the grocery store and coming back he had a new impulse (laughter) and, and he would get a new car.  Now then the car was not necessarily new, it was just different.  And so there were these stories and, and images and I can recall even a few moments, this fleeting memories of childhood, where a choice moment would be to go into what's now the city of Virginia Beach [Virginia], it was Princess Anne County back in the late '50s [1950s] and early '60s [1960s].  And we would go to this black-owned restaurant where they made at that time I thought the best fried chicken that anyone had ever made.  And we would sit there and we would order and then we'd go out into the car and would eat it.  And we would get these knee high sodas with the long straws, and sit there and have a Friday afternoon or Saturday evening, sort of family venture.  And that sense of my Dad as someone who was both committed to the family, working as a custodian actually, for the, down in the federal building, downtown.  He had served in World War II and had come back and worked then in, in the federal job but as a custodian.  And it was just in that sense it was a mixed marriage 'cause my mom [Virginia Carr] was a school teacher.  And he was able to think about the future, although he didn't have a long future.
Speaker 1: Good.  Now do you remember the name of that restaurant that you--
Speaker 2: The restaurant was called Hawkins [Hawkins Inn Restaurant], and it was (laughter), it's funny that, my brother and I went back looking for it years later, of course, it no longer existed, but we had a vague memory of the part of Virginia Beach that it was in.  They were, Virginia Beach like most southern cities had two or three or four nodes of black commercial activity.  And it was in one of those nodes of black commercial activity.
Story_ID: 105995
Speaker 1: So, do you know how your parents met?  Did you--
Speaker 2: My parents met through, so my mom [Virginia Carr] had two siblings, a, a brother, and a, a sister.  My uncle introduced my father [Earl Lewis, Sr.] and mom.  My uncle was younger than my mom but there were so many older guys in the neighborhood, my father was one of the older guys in the neighborhood and he ended up introducing my mom and my dad.
Speaker 1: Now, do you remember any time of your father--, other times in your father's illness, do you remember any of that?
Speaker 2: I, I remember quite a bit actually.  This interesting way where I would dreams at night, nightmares for years where hospitals became both this inviting and dangerous place.  And so what I recall is probably circa 1959, my dad first starting to show some symptoms and then certainly by 1960 he was going over to, there was also a historically black hospital in Norfolk [Virginia], Norfolk Community Hospital.  And so he started at Norfolk Community Hospital getting treatment and looking to see if there was a way that they could cleanse his system in a way, in some ways.  And so he would go in and out for treatment and sometimes in those years there was still blood transfusions, they would sort of give you, try to clean the toxins out of the blood.  And eventually the condition became acute enough that they moved him from Norfolk Community Hospital over to Norfolk General Hospital and the, the colored ward of Norfolk General Hospital [now Sentara Norfolk General Hospital in Norfolk, Virginia].  And I can see actually going there, because he was hospitalized for several months before he died, and standing outside of the hospital with my grandfather, my, my mother's father [Clifton James], and on occasion they would allow one or both of the children to come in but it was not common to allow the children into the hospitals in those days.  We had to get special permission.  So a lot of my memories are actually standing outside of the hospital and waiting to hear reports of how my Dad was faring, and then particularly toward the end of his life when it became clear he was not going to recover, they would then make provisions for me and my brother [Rudolph Lewis] to go in and see him and to hug him and chat a little bit and, and all.  But you're young and five years old almost six years old, imagining that somehow he was gone come home and then on a Saturday morning I recall cartoons were playing Saturday morning, my mom got the phone call that he had died.  It was, November, I'm almost sure it was November 11, 1961.  And so it's Veterans Day and this is Saturday, but I think it was, no it was a Saturday.  And in any event, I, I looked at her and I knew something devastating had occurred and she started crying and then she, then she came back and grabbed me and my brother and said our dad had passed away.  And, you know, I didn't, I mean I knew that meant something but it was really at the funeral when I realized and with the casket before us, and then as we would go and bury him at what's called Roosevelt Memorial Cemetery [sic, Roosevelt Memorial Park] in Chesapeake, Virginia, it was Norfolk County at that point in time, that, that was it.  I mean when they played "Taps" and they sprinkled the ashes and closed the casket and lowered it into the ground, I, I knew that was it.  And that was more than fifty years ago.  And, and as a youngster I, my brother and I would talk about this, and part of our goal was to live beyond thirty-eight.  I mean, knowing that your father died at thirty-eight and you go okay, my goal is to live beyond 38 and fortunately we both did.
Speaker 1: So that's a lot to sort of understand as a five year old--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --in some respects.
Speaker 2: It's a lot.
Speaker 1: You know, because there, there had, was there a lot of angst 'cause, you know, the whole thing of what's sort of happening--
Speaker 2: Well, there was angst on several different levels.  I mean, no one else around us had fathers, parents who were dying.  We lived in a military town and so we had friends whose father's would go off to Vietnam [Vietnam War] and were career military.  We were not.  Our family was not career military.  But there was this sense that whereas most families are building towards something, we were already losing something.  And fortunately for me, my mom had a job.  I mean that's (unclear) had my father been the only provider at that point, it would have been really hard, but fortunately my mom had a job.  And my mom and dad married in '54 [1954], I was born in '55 [1955].  And in 1954 together, my mom was not working at that point, they bought a house.  And so they not only had a job but they had a house and so, and so we had a little place that was what quote unquote "home."  And it was that sense of being able to reestablish the home without my father in it that was the first big transition.
Story_ID: 105996
Speaker 1: So let's talk about your mother [Virginia Carr]--
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: --and her, you know, her family background--
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: --and your grandparents.
Speaker 2: So my mom was also born in Norfolk [Virginia].  And, and my mom was part of that rare group in her neighborhood, so this is Central Norfolk circa 19, she was born in 1927 [May 14, 1927], and so by the-- World War II it, there was little ambiguity that she was gonna go to college.  My grandmother, her mother, my maternal grandmother [Susan James], had one goal in life, she was sending her kids to college.  And it goes back to her own experience, when she was growing up in rural Norfolk County before she moved to the city, she always had a dream of going to St. Augustine [St. Augustine's University] in Raleigh [North Carolina] and becoming a nurse.  She saved money to do so twice, and each time her father turned to her and asked to borrow that money for some other family need.  And the second time it was to help save her older brother who was behind on the taxes on his house.  And so she had saved this money for a second time to go to college, and the second time her father had come to her and says, you know, and the family was, your Bud Luke [ph.] needs this money to keep his house.  And as my grandmother would say to me years later, he still lost that house during the Depression, and that hurt her as much as anything outside of death.  I mean to realize that she was sacrificing, giving away her money twice, and the second time only to see that piece of property be lost no matter what.  So she had made a plan, so she was actually going to actually send her kids to college somehow.  And as it was, my mom ended up going to St. Augustine.  But it was not, she didn't get to St. Aug right away.  After World War II, so sometime in the late 7, '40s [1940s], she started at the Norfolk, Virginia, sorry, the Norfolk division of Virginia State College [now Virginia State University] which is now Norfolk State [Norfolk State University in Norfolk Virginia].  And it was clear to my grandmother, that my mom would get through there but it would be harder 'cause she's at home and there are other kinds of demands on her time and efforts.  So the family story is, my grandmother swears its true, she, she did something she didn't normally ever think of doing, she played the numbers.  She played the numbers and she hit and she used that money to send my mom off to St. Augustine.  And it was a way of getting her out of Norfolk into North Carolina.  And so my mother became the first in the family to get a college degree.  And she ended up, she graduated from St. Aug with a degree in English and in secondary studies, educational studies.  And, and then my grandmother would follow that, eventually she was, both my aunt and my uncle will also go off.  My aunt would go to St. Aug like my mom, and my uncle would go to Kentucky State [University in Frankfort, Kentucky].  And so in the household, my grandmother was a domestic, my grandfather [Clifton James] was a day laborer, well not, he had been a day laborer by this time he was a skilled laborer, painting planes for the government at the naval air station.  And they had aspirations, and so it's that aspirations, so by the time I came along there was never any question would I go to college, because it went all the way back to the early part of the twentieth century and my grandmother had a plan and she not only had a plan set up for her children, she had a plan for her grandchildren as well that they would continue to go on to college, and so was that piece.
Speaker 1: And this big vision probably a lot of energy around getting educated?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  A whole lot of energy getting, around getting educated.  So my grandmother's brother the one I referenced Bud Luke [ph.], her brother, Luke had been a teacher at sort of the turn of the century.  So in my grandmother's family as she would explain it to me, they were two sets of kids.  Her grand, her parents had actually been born as slaves.  And, and had at the end of the Civil War had moved from North Carolina up to rural Virginia and my great-grandfather became a justice of the peace, I, I was told.  And because he had managed to learn to read, even during the end of slavery which meant that he actually was more literate in some ways than a number of the whites that he was working with as well as most of the blacks.  My uncle, my great-uncle, my grandmother's brother then, you know, without much education but enough to allow to him to become a school teacher, became the first sort of generation of teachers.  It just, I, I keep thinking of teachers in that era were part of the working, what I refer to as "middle working class."  They had middle class status and working class wages.  And since they tended to work for three months at a time, and then be unemployed, he made a living but not a, not a great living.  But the value of education was always espoused as a core commitment on the part of at least that side of the family.
Story_ID: 105997
Speaker 1: So let's get names.  Now, your, do you remember the name of your great-grand--
Speaker 2: You know I, I, I--
Speaker 1: Okay. How about your grand, let's just go with your (unclear) (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: Well, my, my grandmother is Susan and so her maiden name was Jordan, and she became James.  My grandfather was Clifton.  And he was Clifton James and so.  And there's a Jordan sort of branch of the family and then the James' and they all were large families.  The typical rural families, 16, 17, 18 kids.
Speaker 1: Can you describe your grandparents?
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: 'Cause you grew up around them.
Speaker 2: I grew up around with my maternal grandparents were, we were close.  And so I, my mom [Virginia Carr] after my father [Earl Lewis, Sr.] died [1961] managed to survive in part, and my grandmother moved in for a period of time as part of that transition to help my mom.  My mom then went back to work full time as a school teacher and, and was working in one city and we were living on, in another city at the--  And so my grandmother, I mean, in terms of physical description or, or okay.
Speaker 1: Description and, and personality.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  So personality, let me start with personality and then I'll go.  My, my grandmother was not highly opinionated but when she said things, everyone listened to her.  I mean she was, she would be willing to actually sit there and let everybody else talk and spout off and but when she thought something needed to be said, she would just turn and say, you know, "Now I've listened, here's how it, I think it should go."  And because she was very balanced and reasoned in her approach, we all listened to grandma (unclear) when grandma said something it's like "Okay."  It's not like when she's talking every second and those economical use of words meant that you should pay attention.  She was warm and inviting it (laughter) she lived in different times.  I managed to always joke with her so.  We would go downtown and my grandmother refused to go on an escalator.  And (laughter) she would look to me she would say, "I see those stairs moving and they shouldn't move, I'm getting on the elevator.  I'm not going to."  I said, "Well, you'll get on an elevator, a shaft and go up and down."  And she goes, "That one makes more sense to me than to this escalator thing."  (Laughter) and so she wouldn't do it and it was the funniest thing in the family to look and go okay.  She would refuse to believe anyone ever landed on the moon.  She goes that's just beyond my ability to grasp.  I, I think if Hollywood can make us see a whole of things, Hollywood can also make us think people landed on the moon.  So there was this way in which she was of a different era where things seemed simpler and more straightforward to her.  But she and my mom, I realized were their own form of social activist and I only really thought about this years later.  So after the sit-in activities in Norfolk [Virginia] in the early 1960s, my, my mom, didn't sit in at Woolworth or at W. T. Grants [W.T. Grant Department Store] but she started taking us down to a lunch counters on Friday afternoons after work.  We would go shopping and then we would go and have a meal at the lunch counter.  And, and it was just a, it was years later, I thought that's interesting, in that she would choose just to do this without any fanfare, without any notice, that we would be sitting there at the lunch counter.  And it was same thing with my grandmother.  There were some of the department stores in Norfolk where she had grown up, where if you were black and you tried on clothes you, you owned them.  And as there was this-- a little window in breaking down those old strictures of segregation in Norfolk.  My mom and my grandmother would go in to these department stores on a Friday evening after work and would try on the clothes.  And, and, and my grandmother would say to me, "I used to not be able to do this.  I can do it now."  And so it was also this sense that she was aware of her place in the world and realized that sometimes small acts could become part of a larger landscape of change.
Story_ID: 105998
Speaker 1: So now when you are, I wanna go to--now what about your grandfather [Clifton James] before I go-- (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: So my grandfather, my grandfather was in some ways far more complicated a person than my grandmother [Susan James].  He said even less (laughter) than my grandmother.  Believe it or not.  But he, he was a working man and he valued work and, and even during The Depression he used to always say to me, "Son even during the Depression I had a job."  I said, what would you have to do granddad?  And he'd go, well, sometimes I had to walk ten miles into, each direction for that job, 'cause he never had a driver's license, he never learned to drive.  He always used public transportation or some other means or walked.  And in the geography of Norfolk [Virginia], there's Norfolk, then there's the Elizabeth River, there's Portsmouth [Virginia], and then there's Chesapeake [Virginia], and he at one point worked at this fertilizer plant that was a good 10 to 12 miles from his home.  And he would have to walk through black neighborhoods and white neighborhoods to get to work.  And he said and some days he ran through the black neighborhoods and he ran through the white neighborhoods to get to work because if he was carrying his paycheck he knew that he could be attacked in either one, especially during the Depression.  And during the Depression if he was a black person walking through a white neighborhood he could just be hassled because that's the way things were.  And, but he, he prided himself on all of this.  But my grandfather also was what I refer to as a weekend alcoholic.  And so all the pressures of living in the segregated South and all would come out on the weekends when he would get his fifth and sit out on his back porch and sort of talk to the winds and philosophize.  And, and I can remember he looked at me one day and he says, "you know, son if I knew now as much as--" "If I had known then as much as I know now, I could have been mayor of this town."  And I was thinking for a guy who had a tenth grade education and that was a pretty profound statement.  And, and it seemed to suggest as he talking, "and you'll have opportunities I didn't."  Just be alert to them.  And, and he never said it quite that way but that's the least of what I inferred.  But I watched him.  He, he lived, my grandmother lived to be about 83, and my grandfather lived to be 76.  And he didn't drink during week but on Friday evenings and, and into Saturday, and then Sunday he'd get up and go to church.
Story_ID: 105999
Speaker 1: And, my grandmother [Susan James] and my grandfather [Clifton James] went to different churches.  But--
Speaker 2: Which one, what was--
Speaker 1: Well, my grandmother and my mom [Virginia Carr] ended up going to church together. So my grandmother's, one of her, another one of her older brothers, William [ph.], well, had been the pastor of one of the larger Baptist churches in Norfolk [Virginia].  My grandfather remained a Baptist, my grandmother in the end like my mom became Presbyterians.
Speaker 2: (Unclear)
Speaker 1: And so--
Speaker 2: They rose up the--
Speaker 1: Yeah.  And so they rose, they rose up and--
Speaker 2: Do you remember the name of the churches?
Speaker 1: I'll think about it.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I'll be able to pull it down.  So, so then the Presbyterian Church was the Messiah Presbyterian Church 'cause my mom and my grandmother were forming, founding members of that church.  They helped to found that church.  My mom remained an elder and active until she died, in that church.  And--
Speaker 2: So is that the church you grew up in?
Speaker 1: That was the church in effect that I grew up in.  We started out as the Church of God in Christ, and then in the, that Church of God in Christ, Christ the core members stayed, the pastor moved from Norfolk to Flint, Michigan, and so it collapsed and then a group of them started another church in the end, became a Presbyterian church.
Speaker 2: That's, that's unusual because--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --you know, Presbyterians, they tend to be liberal but you didn't find them so much in the South--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --too.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  No
Speaker 2: (Unclear) (simultaneous)
Speaker 1: There are three or four black Presbyterian churches in and around, between Norfolk [Virginia], Portsmouth [Virginia], and Hampton [Virginia], Newport News [Virginia].
Speaker 2: But there, there's also, because of the, the black schools you have an educated--
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Exactly.
Speaker 2: --population.
Speaker 1: So you have enough colleges, you know, in and between Hampton and Norfolk State and all that you can create a population.
Story_ID: 106000
Speaker 1: So what's your earliest memory of growing up?
Speaker 2: Fascinating question.  Probably my, one of my earliest memories is in, well, actually it's actually at the beach.  So in Norfolk [Virginia] there is something called the City Beach.  And the City Beach was the black beach up until the 1980s actually.  It was created in the 1930s after protest by black folks saying "We're surrounded by water all around and there's no beach for black people, this is sort of crazy."  And so on the outskirts of town, the city gave a swath of land to the black community and said if you can get there, it's yours.  And so people figured out ways to take buses, 'cause there was, from the core of the black community to the City Beach was not a direct line.  And so, but as a kid we used to get our grill and go down to the beach and grill the hamburgers and hot dogs out there on the beach and then play in the water.  And what I remember is actually that taste of the grill and the sand mixed in with the burger (laughter) that is sort of this really lasting memory of childhood.  It's like okay.  The burger doesn't taste right without a little bit of sand in it (laughter).  And I was probably two or three years old there, and there are some old family photos that, I know my mom [Virginia Carr] had circa 1957 or so of us out at the beach with my cousin and some other family members.
Story_ID: 105547
Speaker 1: But let's take you back--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: To, to the, to the beach, you know, you were talking, you know, we were talking about the, smell of the ocean--
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: --and things like that and the things and the oysters--
Speaker 2: Yes
Speaker 1: Or the--
Speaker 2: And so as childhood I mean one of the images and by the time especially I, I had a driver's license among my friends I was the oldest and so I was older than my brother [Rudolph Lewis] so I, I got the driver's license first and we would find our way down to the beach then, not only to hang out but we would go crabbing.  And as a kid I never really proved to be much of a fisherman, but boy I could crab (laughter).  And there were two ways to crab in those days.  And so the traditional way you put a smelly piece of fish on a string or a chicken on a string and you wade out into the water and you throw it out and you did some reeling in as the crabs would start nibbling and you scoop 'em up and put 'em in your bucket.  And so that's the way I first learned to crab.  And explain to people, if I'd try to explain to my children: while it was labor intensive, it was great joy to see them and knowing you're reeling them in.  And then we ended up getting these crab pots and we would place the pots and eventually we would (laughter) become more economical both with our time and effort and see if we could get a dozen as fast as possible to have a party or something at the house.  But, but that was the other part about going to the beach, it, it was not only just fun to hang out, you actually got a reward at the end if you were willing to make use of the ocean.
Story_ID: 105548
Speaker 1: So I want to, the, the house that you grow up in--
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: The house that your parents [Virginia Carr and Earl Lewis, Sr.] bought, what was the address?
Speaker 2: The address was 936 Spaulding Drive in Norfolk, Virginia.
Speaker 1: So can you describe your, your block?
Speaker 2: Sure.  The block was a, it was a community of men and women who had for the most part, mixture of some who migrated into Norfolk after World War II or during World War II and after and established their first homesteads.  It was a working class, middle-class neighborhood.  So my most immediate neighbor, on, on one side was a woman who was the comptroller at Norfolk State [University in Norfolk, Virginia]. Across the street was a fellow who drove long distance on trucks.  Originally across the street on the other side was someone who had been a school teacher.  They would move out and successive families would move in.  Next door on the, on, if you're in the house on the left side was a woman who worked at the navy shipyard but whose real business she ran a tippling house.  Which is this after-hours joint where they sell liquor by the, by the glass.  And so Ms. Mildred [ph.] had a range of characters who would come in and out of the house, and you could essentially buy almost anything and you knew most of the time it was hot but they were available to members of the community.  Down the block were some friends whose father worked as a crew leader on the longshoremen corner in the hull.  He was a unionized longshoreman.  And since the early 1910s African Americans dominated the docks in Hampton Roads [Virginia].  The first all-black union in Norfolk was founded in 1910 of longshoremen.  And so they were longshoremen, and their family was interesting because their family spanned the, the racial imagination of America.  Their uncle was the Chief of the Cherokee Nation in North Carolina, their one cousin was as blonde and blue eyed as any white American could ever be.  And another cousin was three shades darker than me.  And so if they were all lined up on the front porch--
Speaker 1: And the family's name?
Speaker 2: Last name was Silver [ph.].  The last name Silver [ph.].  And, and they would all line up on the front porch and, you realize, I said, "All right this is my neighborhood where it confounds all of the conventions of life in the segregated South because you realize all kinds of lines have been blurred for a long, long time."  As you go down the street then you would get a series of people who worked in laboring kinds of jobs, often times were in the navy yard or, or the naval air station on, in and around Norfolk.  And then you would get a handful of other school teachers and clerks at different kinds of stores, undertakers, and so it was in that sense a mixed community.  Now the, the only thing I think we're missing I don't, I can't see any attorneys or doctors in the immediate neighborhood.  They lived elsewhere.

Speaker 1: Now, can you take me back and tell me what sights, smells, and sound remind you of your childhood?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) sure.  Sights, sounds, so sights in my childhood would be in the front yard, a bunch of little kids out playing.  And it would, it could be playing football.  So I remember it used to drive my mom [Virginia Carr] crazy, my brother [Rudolph Lewis] and I would come home from church and sometimes before we had gotten out of our Sunday suits, friends would be knocking on the door "You wanna play football?"  And we would be out in the yard playing football, as you can imagine tearing holes in our pants and which did not set well with our mom and-- 'cause she would have to go and them darned in, in, in some ways.  But it was that sense of little groups of kids all coming together and our yard was the locus for activity.  And so kids from all over would come to play football, marbles, basketball, just hang out.  We eventually would get a ping-pong table or something in the garage once my mom built a garage, and folks would hang out and so those sounds of a gathering place of kids, just being kids, sometimes getting into mischief but being kids.  I can-- old TV show from the 1960s "Ivanhoe" and so we all decided we were gonna all be Ivanhoe that day and other kids in the neighborhood were the other team and so we got our swords and we went and had sword fights and, and it got only dangerous when somebody decided to make a bow and arrow and attach something to the end and it was like okay, time out (laughter).  We shouldn't be shooting at each other heads with bows and arrows and all.  But it was that sense of actually playing and where you would have fun but, the, the notion later on where playing in space in urban and kids congregating could be sights of danger, that was not, ours it was actually, it was fun.  So that's sights.  Smell would actually be coming into the house, my mom would be calling for us to come and eat.  And, and, and, she would have cooked something from scratch, and one of our favorites was she made this meatloaf.  And so it was the meatloaf that she would make that would be a mixture of ground beef and green pepper, onion, tomatoes, bread crumbs, and then with a, a sort of ketchup tomato paste over the top and then three strips of bacon over the top of that and, and then oven-cooked.  And you walk in the door and the aroma, it was not a big house and so you walk in the door, probably 1400 square feet, 1600 square foot home, you walk in the door and you go boom, I mean, there you are.  There was this powerful sense that you were home and there always would be cornbread to go along with it and probably some green, some kind of greens as well.  And so that's a smell I have been trying to replicate and after thirty years (laughter) I can't quite, I told my mom before she passed, I said I can do almost every you, you cook, that one I could never quite get the way you cooked it.  And so she would just laugh and she said, "Well, keeping trying" (laughter).  And, and, and that was part but my brother and I both actually watched my mom cook and my grandmother [Susan James] cook and to this day one of the ways I relax myself is going home and I cook and, and, you know, friends would say, "Well what are you doing?"  I said "Well a little bit of this and a little bit of that."  And so I grew up in a house of cookers who with "A pinch of this and a pinch of that" until you, you got it seasoned properly.
Speaker 1: I could tell by the way you describe the--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --you know, the meatloaf--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --with the bacon.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now what about sounds?
Speaker 2: Sounds, that's interesting.  Its, when I think back to my youth at the very least, I mean the only sounds that really jump out are the sounds of the music, of the era, so it was the '50s [1950s] and the '60s [1960s] into early the '70s [1970s], mostly Motown, a little James Brown and, and all.  And then I couldn't sing a lick and but friends would all climb in and we all would sing and I was background (laughter).  They would take the lead and we would try to do our own improvisation of some particular record that was playing.  I mean those were the sounds, in some ways it was the music of my youth.  My, my own children laugh because I'm so out of touch with contemporary music and I go "Yeah, I stopped listening to music circa 1975, '76 [1976], I mean I probably can get to '78 [1978]," I said, "but after that it became a different era."  And my son has come to appreciate it.  But, and my daughter just laughs and accommodates me (laughter).
Speaker 1: Well, no because even you go to-I was at a wedding I was the, but now they have to play the old music--
Speaker 2: Ahh.
Speaker 1: --'cause they don't have music that you can move to.
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: (Laughter)
Speaker 2: Well, and, and my son ends up having this 5,000 songs that he goes back and forth from different eras and so actually he became a history major for a good reason (laughter).
Story_ID: 105550
Speaker 1: So now let's talk about growing up in your household.
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: You know, and what that was like and, and I would, I, I do wanna say that what struck me, was that if I get the dates the right your father [Earl Lewis, Sr.] when he passed away when you were five.
Speaker 2: I was five.
Speaker 1: It's four days before your birthday.
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: And I was just thinking, you know, that that would be sort of, 'cause the family is sort of in mourning you've just buried your father and that's you're trying to celebrate.
Speaker 2: I have no memory of my sixth birthday.  I mean for that reason.  And I'm almost sure I got a car, I mean it was one of those little things where you pedal around, it was something I had wanted.  And some kid down the street would eventually steal it and we had to get it back and all but I, I have almost no memory of that particular birthday at all.  Subsequent birthdays in my childhood, I mean if, if I were to paint the picture, what I remember is the three dominant themes.  One, that my brother [Rudolph Lewis] and I we're very, very close.  I mean we're a year and ten months apart in age.  We're one school grade apart.
Speaker 1: And his name?
Speaker 2: Rudy, Rudolph is his name but he goes by Rudy. And so Rudy would, he, he was always there.  I mean but I had a companion.  In a way sometimes (laughter) like any siblings we had our rivalries but we were always one another's best friends.  And we remain best friends to this day.
Speaker 1: (Unclear)
Speaker 2: And so, yeah, there's that piece of growing up close and that's why it was this way where I kept thinking you know I never felt alone even after my father died because there was always my brother and we shared a room.  I, I jokingly said I unlike today's college students, I went to college to get more space, even though I had a roommate because we had a small little room that we shared and we shared it until I went to college.  And bunk beds and from the time I was six, five or six, until the time I was at eighteen walking out the door.  And, and it was that sense of intimacy that was part of my childhood.  So that's one.  The second was, I have a family that my mom [Virginia Carr], my grandmother [Susan James] and in particular, but my aunt, my, my mom's sister and her husband, you know we, we got to travel.  And so I got to do things that many of my friends never did.  I mean I can remember in 1965 on a bus coming up to New York City [New York], 1964 on a bus coming up to New York City.  1965 on a family car it was a Chrysler Newport and we came and like almost every black family I thought I knew at that point we packed several picnic baskets and ate along the way at rest stops and so you didn't have to deal with people hassling you, and then you came into New York and, and went to the World's Fair and did some other things.  And we would eventually do this similar trip and go all the way up to Montreal [Canada] to the World's Fair [1967 International and Universal Exposition, also known as Expo 67].
Story_ID: 105551
Speaker 1: Okay.  And go all the way up [to Montreal, Canada].  And so there's this way in which I can recall even as a young kid, my world opening up wider than most of the kids in my neighborhood.  Where if they took a trip, it was a trip maybe to Washington, D.C. or maybe to some place in North Carolina but the idea that you would go to New York or that you were gonna go up to Montreal or you were gonna try to see some broader, some place outside of what was common, and so it was this way that home is what you returned to and you never lost but you weren't bound to stay there.  I learned early on by moving and moving about.  And in some ways probably explains why I ended up in Minnesota and my brother [Rudolph Lewis] in the end, ended up in Kentucky for, for school and we've been all over the world since that time.  The third thing I guess I would say from the childhood is just that, there was never any ambiguity that my mom [Virginia Carr] was as devoted to her children as anything.  My mom not only loved us, she was devoted, I mean, to us.  She didn't, my father [Earl Lewis, Sr.] died in 1961 my mom would not remarry until I was a junior in high school.  Not because she couldn't have, it's because she decided that she needed to make sure that my brother and I were well-taken care of and well on our way to doing the things that we needed to do to secure our place in life and in the world.  And it's only as an adult that I realized what sacrifices she really made on our behalfs to give us the security.  And it was not just a security of a home and food and all, it's a security that you could be in this world.  I, I said to people that the irony, it was not until I was well through my high school years that I ever understood the word "minority."  I had grown up in the South where I was in the majority most of the time.  And in that majority I was always led to believe I could do anything that I set my mind to.
Story_ID: 105552
Speaker 1: And it's funny, 1968 [sic, 1967], and I thought I won't remember much of this [1967 International and Universal Exposition, also known as Expo 67, in Montreal, Canada] but I actually did.  I remembered things and I was walking through the old complex, and I go this used to be over here and then you look at a map and oh yeah, it was there but it looked like this.  And you realize that these imprints, when you're a young kid, and well I was twelve years old I think, in '68 [1968], yeah, so before my thirteenth birthday and, but there was something about it because it was so unlike other things that I had seen or were doing.  It was the first time I had been outside of the country.  And it was important but it was that way in which, living where I did, living when I did, this notion I was about to say about growing up in a world where you're always in the majority, and I think in looking at my friends and where many of us are now and it's this bimodal distribution.  It's interesting, sharply defined bimodal distribution.  Several friends who are, are already deceased in their fifties, and others who are well-placed and well-regarded as part of that first generation to live through desegregation in the South.  Yeah.
Story_ID: 105553
Speaker 1: It's, it's really, you know to your recount, I was just think, you know, it's aspirational, it's nurturing--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --it's got, not that's its perfect though--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --it has all those aspects to it.  I wanted you the, but you're the oldest son.
Speaker 2: I'm the oldest.
Speaker 1: So when your father [Earl Lewis, Sr.] died was there any, you know how a lot of times they say that the oldest wants to be the man of the house or feels that obligation and I don't hear that here.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I, I came to realize that I had heard that and in fact I would tell my, my mom [Virginia Carr] she thought my brother [Rudolph Lewis] and I had lost our minds 'cause we, we sort of swore that at least twice we saw things in the house that she couldn't find.  And one of those is I swore I had an encounter with my father after he died.  And, and where he essentially said to me, "I'm gone now.  I'll be looking after you guys and to the best of my ability but you're the man of the house now" and I had thought "Okay.  I don't know what that means," I heard it but I also came to realize my mom was one tough lady.  And so when she put her mind to something and she wanted it done she could be quite persistent.  I mean, as much as anything I think my mom needs my brother and I not to create too much of hassle for her that maybe the best gift that I give, give her because she will argue her own case quite effectively.  Excuse me, please.  And so I, I would watch her at times where she thought either she wasn't getting the proper respect or do push and push and push and push hard.  And so and in that sense I thought well she does not need the, the classic young kid to be the man of the house.  She, and so we, and we all adopted and adapted over time.  But no I can remember this and so I don't know whether, your five years old, six years old you're not sure what's being imagined.  But the other thing was a cat, with my brother and I both saw this black cat come through the house and we both swore we saw it.  There was only one way into the house, and there was only one way out of the house, my mom searched that house up and down she never saw this black cat.
Speaker 1: Was that around the time when your, your father's--
Speaker 2: It was, it was several months after my father died.  It was several months after and so.
Speaker 1: The both of you said that you saw it?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  So both of us said we saw it and that's what convinced my mom it's not just me imagining, my brother said he saw it to.  And, and we decided we probably did and we'll never know what it was.
Story_ID: 105554
Speaker 1: So what was life like at home in that way, I mean were there chores or--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: And you, I know you said your grandmother [Susan James] came to live with you for--
Speaker 2: My grandmother came to live for a while.  One of my mom's cousins came and lived with us for a while, and so there were family members in, in and through.  But no we had chores.  My mom (laughter) there were seasons of chores.  So a couple times in a year, we knew we were gonna spend three days in cleaning the house from top to bottom.  So we had take the windows out and, and it was not just to wash them we had to take them out and wash them.  You had to take the curtains down, we would have to go with her, 'cause at that point and time we did not have washer and dryer in the house, and so on Saturday mornings we knew we were gonna go with her to the laundromat to wash clothes and my brother couldn't wait until he was old enough to know how to do plumbing.  He's a, my brother's an engineer now, and he, he was well on the way on to his engineering degree when he was fourteen (unclear), I'm, I'm redoing the house.  I'm gonna redo the plumbing and we're gonna put a washer and dryer in so I don't have to go out to the wash and, and go out.  And he did, he installed a washer and dryer.  He, he dropped a plumbing line and they soldered them and he read a book and he figured it out and a Vice President of Raytheon because early on he realized he wanted some parts of his life to be simpler (laughter) and he was tired of hanging out at the laundromat on Saturday morning.  But we had that from washing dishes and cutting the grass I mean, so we got a lawn mower and we would cut the, our grass and then we would make money cutting other people's grasses.  We would be responsible when we got older for the maintenance of the cars and, and a whole range of other things too and that went with being at home.
Story_ID: 105555
Speaker 1: So what were you like, Earl?  How would you describe yourself in that sort of eight or nine year old sort of your--I mean, how--
Speaker 2: Eight or nine I was this I was chubby, little smart kid who--
Speaker 1: Chubby?
Speaker 2: Yeah, oh, yeah.  Yeah, I was a chubby, little smart kid and so that's what (unclear).  I mean people were to ask me now, they, they'd be asked "So what did Earl look like" and you go back to those pictures of my brother [Rudolph Lewis] who is, my brother was almost always as tall if not taller than me, and he was always lean and in that period of my life I was chubby and, and so at eight and nine but I learned things quickly.  And so I tended to do reasonably well in school and get into a lot of trouble at school.
Speaker 1: So where was, what elementary school?
Speaker 2: So the elementary school, so my mom [Virginia Carr] was teaching at that point over in what's now the city of Chesapeake [Virginia], it was Norfolk County at that period and so it was Crestwood.  Crestwood [High School] was an all-black elementary, junior high, and high school.  There were three different facilities.  My mom was teaching fifth grade at that point in time.
Speaker 1: So she was at the school you attended?
Speaker 2: So she was at the school I attended.  So every time I got into trouble and she, my mom knew about it unfortunately for me.  And first grade I was out in the hall more times than she thought was permissible and so she sent word that if she saw me out in the hall again, not only would I get in trouble at school, but--
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 2: --I was gone get a spanking when I got home.  And I decided to minimize the number of times I was in the hall as a result.
Speaker 1: Now why were you in the hallways?
Speaker 2: I was, I was just bored.  I was bored.  I would finish with work early on, and then I'd start goofing around and playing.  Yeah, I was practical joker and being a practical joker when you're six years old can land you in a lot of trouble at that point.  But we, it, probably would have helped to have given me more work to do, and thirty-five kids and a teacher which I think like a whole lot of teachers trying to deal with the kids who needed more assistance, and, and attention.  And what I realized most school work well through, I was pretty good at doing and (laughter) I would, could get bored after a while and, and once I figured it out, I thought "Okay, now what's there to do" and would be punished for it, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So were, you weren't a smart aleck though?
Speaker 2: I didn't think I was, I mean, the teachers, you know it's one of those things, I didn't I was smart aleck, man, and I didn't say it as loud-- as much as what I did.  I mean there was, so yeah it was so here's, here's an example.  I mean one of my good friends who Eady [ph.] who is now an attorney for the state of Massachusetts.  You know, Eady go to sit down and I thought it would be fun just to pull his chair out.  And it's the kind of antics that you get when you're a youngster.  And so, and then I knew that I could do at that particular point much of the work that was before me.  And--
Speaker 1: Now is this in what, when you're talking about this are you talking about first, second, third, or fourth, fifth, sixth?
Speaker 2: Actually I could do, I mean I got into, I would get into periodic trouble in fifth and sixth as well but it was mostly in those first and second grades.  Third grade teacher was Mrs. Cassell [ph.] had a very heavy ruler so we all learned after a while that we wanted to minimize the encounters with Ms. Cassell [ph.].  There were two Ms. Cassells, one older and one younger and we had older Mrs. Cassell [ph.] by the third grade and we were like, naw, no.  We, we wanted to avoid that ruler.  So I got, I got a few licks but not as many as I have would gotten in my first and second grade years.
Story_ID: 105556
Speaker 1: So what were your other interests then, too?
Speaker 2: Uh--
Speaker 1: Did you have an interest in sports or--
Speaker 2: Well, I had a little bit of interest in sports at that particular point in time and, and part of the challenge for us even if I had it, one there was not a lot of organized sports in any elementary school in that day and age.  And two, I, I was going to school in one city [Chesapeake, Virginia] and I was living in another [Norfolk, Virginia].
Speaker 1: So you were commuting with your mother [Virginia Carr]?
Speaker 2: I was commuting with my mother.
Speaker 1: So I don't think I understood that.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So you commuted to school?
Speaker 2: I commuted to school with my mom.  So I was living in Norfolk and going to school in Chesapeake and the State of Virginia was happy with that as long as we maintained segregation.  And so they actually would give a check, so the state actually would send a check to Chesapeake to cover, 'cause we weren't living there and we didn't pay property taxes but the state underwrote me going to school in Chesapeake 'cause it, it supported segregation.
Speaker 1: And was that the same for case with Rudy [Rudolph Lewis]?
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My brother.  By the time, so the next year it was Rudy. I mean I can remember the first day for instance when I went to Crestwood [Elementary School], I didn't know a soul.  I mean I walked into this school, the only person I knew in the entire school was my mom.  I walked into this big 'ol cafeteria with a whole bunch of, other first year kids.  And most of them knew each other 'cause they lived in the same neighborhoods, they had gone to the same kindergartens, if they had gone at all.  I had to meet everyone.  And then my friend Eady [ph.] who I was referencing, her mom was a school teacher.  She lived in Portsmouth [Virginia], so she came.  And so there was a group of us who had actually, our parents were teachers in the school area around and we all found one another in, in a way, so, yeah.  No, I commuted.
Speaker 1: And, and that would help 'cause you don't, you know, they're just bringing you with them--
Speaker 2: Yeah, exactly.
Speaker 1: And then that--
Speaker 2: It helped.
Speaker 1: (Unclear) (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: It, it simplified life a whole lot.  My mom didn't have to worry me.  In kindergarten, I was going to kindergarten in, in Norfolk and, not too far from my grandparents [Susan James and Clifton James], and so my mom would drop me off at my grandparents, and my grandparents would then take me over to kindergarten or get me to kindergarten and then arrange to have me dropped back at, at their house.  But it was much simpler the next year.  And then my brother was left alone then that next year then he caught up and we were there, and, it wasn't always easy being the kid of a school teacher.  I mean that we found ourselves in scrapes and on the playground after school because kids in the neighborhood wanted to pick on you because they thought, you know, you're the teacher's kid so you need a whooping and, you know, it was not whipping, it was whooping, to be reminded of the order of things.  And so we had to protect ourselves on a couple of occasions.
Speaker 1: And you were taught, taught how to protect yourself.  Did it--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I mean part because, it was funny because I saw myself, I mean I was chubby but I thought of myself then as big, right, so.  I, I think, you know, come if, if you come near me and I get a hold you, you're in trouble, and so I, I held my own.  My brother was smaller and so they would go after him first and then, and then I would have to jump in.  And I, yeah I held my own during those years and then.
Speaker 1: So you went to Crestwood until sixth grade?
Speaker 2: I went to Crestwood Elementary School until sixth grade, then I went to Crestwood Junior High School seventh, eighth grade.  It was middle, it was junior high and then I started at Crestwood High School in ninth grade and at the end of ninth grade they finally decided to phase out the black high schools and they shifted us all to a series of, of freestanding what had been predominantly white high schools.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 106001
Speaker 1: Ninth grade it's all, me rolling back a little bit, seventh grade my mom [Virginia Carr] gets a call.  And she gets a call to say that she's gonna be among the first black school teachers to desegregate predominantly white schools.  She gets a letter actually.  And she starts crying.  She didn't wanna be a part of this group where she was leaving Crestwood and having to go to Sparrow Road [Intermediate School] which is not too far from Indian River [High School] where I ended up going to high school.  But that first year she has been picked out to be among the first black school teachers to go and it was a big transition.
Speaker 2: And this is what year?
Speaker 1: This would have been probably '69 [1969], probably about '69 [1969]. '69 [1969].  And that's when we began to realize, okay so change is afoot.  By that same time, by the time I was a freshman in high school, so probably 1970, I think it was, '69 [1969], '70 [1970], '70 [1970], they start introducing white school teachers into the historically black high school but no students, just teachers.  Most of whom had just finished college and so they were brand new and that was the experiment.  That next year we would then go, they would close Crestwood and I would go to Indian River and it was the most tense year of transition.  There were cops in the hall every day.  If you stepped on someone's sneakers there was a fight.  There were bathrooms that became color-coded.  If you stumbled into the wrong one you could find yourself in a fight.  It was this part of young people who had learned the histories well.  So I'm in the band right and so one of the kids in the band, Tommy [ph.], it was black a kid Tommy Jones [ph.], Tommy was first seat sax [saxophone], very good sax player.  Next to him was a kid, and I'm forgetting his name, but anyway his uncle was the Grand Dragon of the Ku Klux Klan in local, how do we know this, you learn these things, right.  And we were joking one day 'cause Tommy also had a black belt in karate and he was showing us a move and this other kid happened to be coming through the door, it was out of completely accidental, but he hit him in the nose and bloodies his nose.  And so we were joking and said "Tommy, you gone get a cross burned on your lawn tonight."  And but it's that social commentary in school that actually is sort of framing the context.
Story_ID: 106002
Speaker 1: It was not just the, the students it was the teachers as well.  I, I tell the story, I had a geometry teacher, Mrs. Overby [ph.]--
Speaker 2: And this is at Indian River [High School in Chesapeake, Virginia]?
Speaker 1: This is at Indian River in the tenth grade.  And the class about 40 percent African Americans, 60 percent white and Asian, there were a handful of Asian kids.  And Mrs. Overby [ph.] one day starts regaling us with stories about the good old days on the plantation.  And we were sort of sitting here going, "Good old days.  I don't know if we have that interpretation but what does this have to do geometry?"  And she was the geometry teacher, not the social studies teacher.  And, and it was that part in these early years, the transition that Ms.--my, my brother [Rudolph Lewis] had the hardest time with Mrs. Overby [ph.] because he, there were in her mind, there was only one way to do a proof and my brother believed that were many ways to do a proof and, and he would lock horns and years later he would go off to Virginia Tech [Virginia Polytechnic Institute in Blacksburg, Virginia] first before going go [University of Louisville in Louisville, Kentucky] Louisville where he would get his undergrad and graduate degree.  And he came, he came back and he says "I knew I was right and she was wrong" (laughter).  He showed her there were multiple ways of doing proof, and but it took college to verify what he understood and it was more about Mrs. Overby [ph.].  I ended up then, a woman, Mrs. Richards [ph.] who taught the advanced biology class, there were thirty in this advanced biology class.  There were three African Americans.  I was the only African American male, there was Cheryl Reid [ph.], a friend of mine, and Valerie Johnson [ph.], another friend.  The three of us and then twenty-something white kids in the advanced biology class, where the school itself was about 50, 45 percent African American, 55 percent white and other.  And so we were just like, I was like how did it happen that all of my other friends didn't end who, who were able to, didn't end up in this advanced biology class?  And how did I end up being the only guy?  And then Mrs. Richards who was fine.  Could not say the word "Negro" to save her life.  "Negro" always came out as "Negra" and, and I was looking at her going, you know, you don't even need to say it, just tell me about biology and all.  And so it was this part of making that transition where the school was new, the labs were better, better access to equipment and the curriculum and in some ways.  But there was also the social milieu where everyone was trying to sort out the new order.  And so and that was my sophomore year.  And by my senior year my friend Valerie was Student Body President and another friend, another friend named Cheryl [ph.] had won homecoming queen.  And so, and, and for a moment we had figured out among the students how to get along.  There were no longer the fights in the hall.  There were no longer the color coded bathrooms.  I, I had been (unclear) been elected by the class "most intellectual of the senior class."  And so that was, that was the way I left Indian River High School as being voted most intellectual.  And I had to laugh later, years later thinking, "how did they know?"  And but it was, and then I would hear from friends who had kids who would go to this school years later that the sad irony is that many of our schools have resegregated themselves in intense ways including Indian River.  I lived through at least three little cycles in that period.  But what it reminded me, and in fact in some ways why I left Virginia and went to Minnesota, is that if I was gonna grow in a different way I needed to move away from home.  And I needed to, and I wasn't brave enough to go to UVA [University of Virginia in Charlottesville, Virginia].  I have friends who went to UVA and I thought I just went through this in high school I, and I do not wanna go to a place so steeped in tradition that I'll be fighting all kinds of battles some visible and some not visible.  So I went to Minnesota believing, okay there aren't, the experience with African Americans and black kids in Minnesota and particularly in Western Minnesota is gone be so slim and that I should be able to carve out a whole brand new chapter.  And, and it was true.
Story_ID: 106003
Speaker 1: We were talking about the '60s, you know, how it was--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --in the, you know, the, '60s [1960s], and what were you experiencing, I mean your mother [Virginia Carr].  And then at Indian River [High School in Chesapeake, Virginia].
Speaker 2: Sure.  So to conclude part of it the challenges as we made this transition and we had gone through really by the end of the '60s [1960s] into the early '70s [1970s], successive groups of students came to understand one another but it required work.  And a little bit of trust and some scary things happened.  I can recall (laughter) my brother [Rudolph Lewis] and I and four or five other black kids we were the first to integrate the Key Club which is the Junior Kiwanis Club.  And I can remember the first time where our Key Club chapter went to sit in with the older Kiwanis guys.  They were all white and they were all the guys who essentially ran the city and they used the Kiwanis Club to cut the deals for a lot of them to run the city.  And we run, walk in, I mean the only other black people in there were the people serving.  And, and they didn't know what to do all of a sudden because they had this sense that there was this code of silence, or at least the cone of silence now inside of this room and where they could say whatever that wanted to say and they brought in the Key Club and it was now integrated and they had a handful of black kids.  And, and I could still remember the look on these guys going "Oh, oh okay this is changing."  But, I, I give credit to my chemistry teacher Mr. Woodall [ph.] was the guy who was the Key Club representative, faculty representative.  And he was making a point of saying "You're Key Club members and I'm bringing you along to all the meetings."  And, and years later I would think back and I would smile and say all right that was actually stepping out there for him.  And--
Speaker 1: So he was white?
Speaker 2: He was white.  He was white and he was our chemistry teacher and I took chemistry from him and my brother took chemistry from him and our other friends would take chemistry from him, Calvin [ph.] and some of others.  But one night after leaving one of those Key Club meetings one of our friends, and I just blanked on his name, but one of our friends we, my brother and I had a car so we dropped everyone off and then, in what was Chesapeake and then we drove home to Norfolk [Virginia].  Before we got home or after we got home we got a call saying one of the friends had been shot on his front porch.  Somebody from an adjoining working class white community had shot across the fence and shot the kid in the shoulder.  He survived, I mean he was fine but it was this notion that it was not just that these were sometimes a war of words or kids in fisticuffs and but there were adults who were engaging in behavior as well and in this case that could have been tragic had he been shot a few inches more to his right and where instead of just piercing the shoulder, it had gone into a vital order, organ or artery.  And so I was reminded on a constant basis that the challenges before us all, was to try to figure out "What kind of America we really wanna live in and who gets to be part of this America?"  And fortunately for me my grandmother's [Susan James] take on the, on the role and the value of education was the one piece that was the constant through--
Story_ID: 106004
Speaker 1: And I think for my mom [Virginia Carr] it was hard in those first years being among the group of first black school teachers to go.  I remember her coming back with this classic line, right.  She goes and after the first day I said "How was it mom," we were at the dinner table.  She says, "Oh, my God."  I said, "What?"  She says, "I'm not gonna ever be able to tell them apart" (laughter).  And we just started laughing and I said, "Mom you're kidding me."  I said, "You know what that sounds like?"  She says, "I know, but it's like there's a group of little blonde kids and there are a group of little dark haired kids and they are sitting here" and I'm like "Oh, my God."  And (laughter) so she struggled in that first year trying to distinguish her group of little blonde kids from her group of little brunette kids and I think the red haired ones were easier to pick out of the crowd.  But she would adapt.  But it was I, I remember that down to this day her coming home and saying--
Speaker 2: Did she ever talk about frustrations as a teacher?  I'm, in that integrated environment or not being treated fairly or you don't hear?
Speaker 1: She would not talk about frustrations until later, and so well after I had graduated from high school, in fact, graduated from college.  The city decided it was gonna apply some new standards.  So my mom who, she had been an elementary school teacher for twenty-something years, was told that she had the wrong credentials and that she had the credentials for middle school or high school, but not for elementary, notwithstanding twenty-something years of experience.  And so they would reassign her to a middle school.  And that was enough to get her to quit.  And so she would decide, new principal, a young guy trying to make his own name by hassling and she had both more experience and had seen more types of students than he ever would.  She quit.  And, and what happened, she quit, she took a year off.  She had her own version of the sabbatical, and then she became a youth counselor for the city of Norfolk [Virginia], working in essentially city homes for kids who were displaced and all.  And she did that until she retired.
Story_ID: 106005
Speaker 1: So now, you, so you said you graduated "most likely to succeed"--
Speaker 2: No--
Speaker 1: What was it--
Speaker 2: I was voted, I graduated "most intellectual."
Speaker 1: Most intellectual.  Okay.  I was gonna say (unclear).  Okay, so most intellectual.  So this is in a mixed school though?
Speaker 2: It was in a mixed school.
Speaker 1: An integrated school.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And I, I know you said you, you made the decision but where does the University of Minnesota, where, how, wait is it--
Speaker 2: No
Speaker 1: Concordia [College in Moorhead, Minnesota].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Concordia, I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But how do you find out about Concordia?
Speaker 2: Concordia at that point and time thought it wanted to integrate so they sent notices to all black kids all over the country who only had a certain test score, and I started getting literature from them.  And I responded and I started getting literature.  And there was something about it, it I didn't know anything about Lutheran so I mean it's not because it's a Lutheran affiliated school and, and I would jokingly say I came back after my freshmen year first semester and opened the phone book in Norfolk [Virginia] going I know there's some Lutheran churches here somewhere.  But I had never actually been to a Lutheran church and so it was the Lutheran aspect of Concordia but it was the way it described itself to the world and saying it was committed to bringing in students of color, African Americans and Native American students to prepare young men and women of the Christian faith to lead in the world.  And that was the motto then, it's still the motto in some ways, and I thought okay.  Let's take a look at this place.  And then they offered me an academic scholarship sizable enough that I thought I could actually make this work.  It was different than anything else that I had looked at and I, like I said I wasn't comfortable going to UVA [University of Virginia in Charlottesville, Virginia] at that point in time.  Some of the other smaller schools along the eastern seaboard, no, the HBCUs [Historically Black Colleges and Universities], Hampton [Institute, now Hampton University, in Hampton, Virginia] literally is in the backyard and all and I thought I need to get away from home.  My mom [Virginia Carr] and I both agreed I should go away from home.  So I went to Minnesota.  And it was as far away from home as I ever thought I wanted to go.
Story_ID: 106006
Speaker 1: So describe-- so, where is Concordia [College in Moorhead, Minnesota] located, and also are you going there sight unseen or did you make a visit that's--
Speaker 2: I made a decision to go to Concordia sight unseen, that is, I had already accepted by the time I would go and make my first visit.  So Concordia is in Moorhead, Minnesota, which is western Minnesota, it's four and a half hours by car, west of the Twin Cities, Minneapolis-St. Paul [Minnesota].  It's on, the, the Red River Valley, the Red River [Red River of the North], Red River itself separates Moorhead, Minnesota from Fargo, North Dakota.  So if you're gonna fly in, you fly into Fargo and take a cab five minutes or ten minutes to the college.  And so in 1974, that summer my mom [Virginia Carr], my grandmother [Susan James] was still alive, my mom, my grandmother, my brother [Rudolph Lewis] and I took a Greyhound bus from Norfolk, Virginia to Moorhead, Minnesota for me to see this school before I was to fly there a month and a half later.  It was orientation.  And I got there and I go, "Oh, my gosh."  This is ni-- like nothing I have seen before.  It was Scandina--, it was not just white, it was Scandinavian white and it was not a frame of reference that I knew.  I mean it was small and all but I thought, you know, I said I would try this.  And if worse comes to worse I made a mistake and I'll have to find someplace else to go in a year or two.  And I got there and, at that point in life, Concordia, I, I'm on the board now, of trustees at Concordia so, and I remind them they engaged in an experiment in the early 1970s that they would never engage in, in again.  They believed then that actually, they could actually recruit a lot of black students, so there were well over a hundred black and African students at Concordia in 1974.
Speaker 1: And out of the population of?
Speaker 2: About, around 2,000.  And so we had one of the highest percentage wise, highest number of black students anywhere in the country at that particular, in that point in time.  And large enough to even have cliques, you know, it was like (laughter) where everyone didn't have to agree with everyone and get along and, and all.  So, and they came from all over, L.A. [Los Angeles, California]; Chicago [Illinois]; Minneapolis [Minnesota]; Jackson, Mississippi; Houston, Texas; Memphis, Tennessee; New Haven [Connecticut], I mean, when I got there, New Orleans [Louisiana], I got there and I go wow, made friends from Detroit [Michigan] and from Muskegon, Michigan along with Louisville, Kentucky and I'm going there's all kind of black folks in a small, little Lutheran school and we all grew up together.  There are some of us succeeded in that environment, others were done in by that environment.  My freshman year one of the guys Jacques [ph.] who came in with me, black kid from Las Vegas [Nevada], attempted suicide twelve times through his freshman year.  There were other things clearly going on with him and in his life and that college, and that environment didn't make it better.  Another a black woman ended up successfully committing suicide in her senior year.  She was a senior my freshman year and she committed suicide and we were like, "Woah.  What's going on?"  But the campus in and of itself tried to be responsive to a degree.
Story_ID: 106007
Speaker 1: So my freshman year [at Concordia College in Moorhead, Minnesota], my sophomore year, was it my sophomore or my junior year, must have been my junior year but any, anyway we would go on strike for ten days and we would boycott classes for ten days.  We would have Russell Means, who was on trial for AIM [American Indian Movement], over activities over in Fargo [North Dakota], come over to meet with us and rally with us, because what we had come to realize and, we had tried to help the administration understand is, they brought us all in assuming like in any set of college students we would come in and we would change because that's what college does.  It's a socialization process.  And, you know, we tried to remind them that when you bring in that many black kids from all over the country, we also want the institution to change.  And it, what we realized, sure, we'll have to change but the institution should change as well.  And the institution was less committed to changing and has never had that many black students since.  And so when I go up and talk to the kids and they go, "You know, I would really like for there to be a more diverse student body," and I go "you had one once.  Has anyone actually seen fit to call and talk to their '70s [1970s] generation to figure out why these kids from all over the country came to, to, Moorhead, Minnesota, Fargo, North Dakota in 1973, '74 [1974], '72 [1972], '75 [1975], '76 [1976].  I can put you in contact with a good number of them and, and in fact, the way I know it, if I put you into contact with one, somebody else knows someone else and before you know it you can probably find one hundred."  I gave, years later I would go and give a lecture and I would say, you know, there were over a hundred black students here at one point and the then head of alumni relations who had been the deputy campus minister at the time, a guy named Ernie Mancini, Ernie was from, Italian guy from New Jersey who ended up as campus minister and we used to always joke, I said, "I'm part of the odd couple, you're the other part 'cause you shouldn't be here either." (laughter)  Ernie said, "Earl that's not right."  I said, "Ernie I'm a social historian.  If you have your records, we can test it.  I'm almost sure I'm right."  And so he went back and we found and we went through 'em and he said, oh, yeah, you're right.  There were that many.  And I said see part of the problems no one even remembers there were that many because we, if you've written a narrative to say there were some, but, and you only count the ones who graduate, but if you actually count the ones who were enrolled at one particular point in time, there was a sizable community.  So I went in and so in that sense it, in the end once I got there, it was not as foreign and alienating as, as I thought it would be because there were a lot of black kids around.
Story_ID: 106008
Speaker 1: So now, what are you learning about yourself and then what major are you taking on?
Speaker 2: So--
Speaker 1: Because you you--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  So I had, I'm learning that all of the things I thought I knew about myself, I'm learning in a new way.  And so I'm learning how you actually affect change in an organization.  So I go in, I decided when I leave Virginia in 1974, I'm gone be a psychology major.  And if you look at my high school [Indian River High School in Chesapeake, Virginia] year book it will say, "I'm gonna major in psychology and accounting."  'Cause I was, I was interested in psychology but I wanted to be practical, nothing else then accounting and I can do that and I'll always be able to find some kind of a job somewhere.  I couldn't get into an accounting classes my second semester, freshmen year and I took a history class instead.  It was an African history class.  I never did take an accounting class.  I just thought, "Oh, I like this history."  And so I ended up deciding to double major in history and psychology and then minor in political science.  And I was a fortunate one because in college I got to be on research projects and publish research both in psychology and history.  And so I was on a history, sorry a psychology project where we worked on, see if we could reduce hypertension in pre-hypertensive young males by using biofeedback, feedback techniques through meditation.  And--
Speaker 1: That's innovative.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  This was 1975.  So--
Speaker 1: Those things are just actually coming--
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: --into being.
Speaker 2: Precisely.  And we were doing it back then.  It was published in the Psychological Bulletin [sic, Psychological Reports, 1979] way back and I was the research assistant.  So--
Speaker 1: So who's your professor that you--
Speaker 2: At that point it was a team of people I was working with.  There was a guy named Al, [Albert] Al Bartz, and Al has actually, he wrote one of the most successful basic stat courses for psychology, stat books rather for psychology there was, so he was the statistician.  There was a guy named Al Zimmerman who was a clinician, who was a clinical psychologist.  And then there was a guy named Hal Bertilson who was the design psychology and experimental psychology.  So it was the three of them that designed this experiment and I worked on it collecting the data, coding the data, and getting it ready for analysis et cetera.  And then my senior year, I wrote my senior thesis in, on blacks in the Red River Valley and which became my first published piece in 1978 and all.  So what I learned there, is just that I could find mentors in a variety of forms, in a variety of ways.  I had people who actually believed in me.  It was, it was interesting.  I mean there was no black faculty but I had mostly white male faculty members who believed and developed and were willing to give me a chance.  And, and it's interesting because my first psychology class I, I hated introductory psychology.  It was a series of multiple choice tests and I hated multiple choice tests because I spent too much time trying to reason and, and I could always in an A and B proposition I can always see something between A and B.  And, and so I did mediocre on that part of the course but on the research experiment where I had to design my own research experiment and write it up, explain it and all, I got an A plus.  And so, and then I would get after the initial freshmen class, I would get As in almost every other psychology class but I got a, I had a C something, B, low B in that first class and it was balanced between my research, but nonetheless the faculty saw something in me and invited me to be a research assistant on this project (unclear).  And by the time I was senior I was a TA [teacher's assistant] in that course that I hated in my freshmen year.  And, and that was worthwhile because I actually got to know the faculty and spend time with them.  And in the history side, one of the guys who ended up being my mentor literally passed me on to the person who became my mentor in graduate school.
Speaker 1: So who was that person and who did they pass you to?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  So the person, Carroll Engelhardt was the history professor at Concordia.  Carroll was an American historian, intellectual, institutional historian.  He would then pass me on to [Russell] Russ Menard, Russ, you know, the economic historian of the colonial era was at [University of] Minnesota [Minneapolis, Minnesota], Russ and Carroll had gone to graduate school together at [University of] Iowa [Iowa City, Iowa].
Story_ID: 106009
Speaker 1: And when I got into the University of Minnesota [Minneapolis, Minnesota] right after I finished Concordia [College in Moorhead, Minnesota], so I left Concordia and went right to Minnesota with, to University of Minnesota, with a break in the summer where I worked for Minnesota Mutual Life Insurance Company and I designed an attitude survey for the whole company and implemented that attitude survey using my psychology degree.  And then a few months later I left there, they hired someone else to do the data analysis and I went to graduate school at the University of Minnesota, initially just to get a masters.  I was gonna get a masters.  And I got into graduate school and I discovered I still, if, if I have something to work on, it was actually finding my own voice as a writer because I realized undergrad and even early graduate school, you're reading so many different people and you're trying to figure out how to be like one of them.  And then Russ [Russell Menard] took me aside one day and he said, "Earl, let me tell you a secret."  I said, "Sure Russ."  He says, "I started out thinking I was gonna be the next generation Perry Miller and only discovered I couldn't do the work in intellectual colonial history the way Perry Miller did.  And then I became an economic historian and it refocused who I was and I was able to find by own voice."  He says, "Just think about who you wanna be.  Stop thinking about who all these other folks have been, and see if you can't find your own voice."  That was actually quite valuable and--  So my second year of graduate school in the masters program I thought, "You know what?  I may be able to get a Ph.D."  Meanwhile Joe Trotter [Joe William Trotter, Jr.] was ahead of me.  So Joe pulled me aside and he says, "Earl," and I said, "What?"  He said, "I got a prediction."  I go "What's that's, Joe?"  He goes, you gone be the next African American to get a Ph.D. from the University of Minnesota in the History Department.  I said, "Well there are people ahead of me."  He says, "I know.  But you will be."  And, and, and I to this day I thank him 'cause it was at that point where he was telling me something that I was just discovering about myself.  That yeah, I could do this.  And, and so after getting the masters then I talked to the professors and applied to get into the Ph.D. and, and with an understanding and said, "And this is how long I plan to be in graduate school."  So I, tell me now if I can, I don't wanna be here more than six total years.  I've had enough Minnesota winters.  I know exactly how many more I plan.  And they all agreed they thought I could move at pace and Joe had been able to do it in five and I figured I could do it in six.  He was on full scholarship the whole time and I wasn't.  And, and I did.  And, and even in, even at the university I ended up discovering that I could do a lot of things in that graduate program and so I ended up my, my major was, area was U.S. History.  But I also had a heavy secondary major in African Peoples History.  And so I used to always joke with my own doctoral students who would complain about exams, I'd say "Look, I took an eight hour written exam in U.S. History.  I took an eight hour written exam in African History.  And then I took a two hour oral exam.  So that was sixteen hours of writing.  And four hours I think, you can survive."  And, and, and that was the sense and I remember talking, Allen Isaacman and Lansine Kaba and I said "Why are you guys making me take this eight hour written exam.?  I'm not an Africanist.  I mean it's not my major area."  And they, they said, "because we know you can do it."
Story_ID: 106010
Speaker 1: I really didn't decide I was gonna go into the academy probably until my second, somewhere between second and third year of graduate school [University of Minnesota in Minneapolis, Minnesota].  I mean and in interesting way because--
Speaker 2: But when you're going to take your masters, what are you thinking you're gonna do, is that just--
Speaker 1: It was a stage.  I thought if I don't this I'll go, I had been offered a job, and way in between I got called by Prudential Life Insurance Company and I had taken some test somewhere along the way and they said, "You scored so high, would you like to come and work in the insurance industry and be an analyst for us" and do some other things.  And I was like okay.  I mean, I thought if I don't this, I'll do something else.  And I'm one of those folks who kept believing that I had, I could change my career several times but, and, and as a result, in fact I lost a Danforth Fellowship opportunity.  I--
Speaker 2: I was wanna gonna say 'cause you just I, I saw that you had a Danforth Fellowship--
Speaker 1: Well I didn't actually, I was finalist and, and then but the, the question that I realized in hindsight, I was too honest.  Somebody said "Earl you're too honest.  You gotta stop being so honest."  And I said "Why?"  And the guy, this fellow asked me "So, tell me in ten years after you're a faculty member, what you hope to achieve."  And I looked at him and I said "I'm not sure I wanna be a faculty member, let alone for ten years."  And I could see him writing furiously and, and I realized it was at that point, because they were trying to populate the academy and while I had many of the attributes, I was not yet prepared to make a commitment to the academy for a lifetime and, and as I walked away, someone said "How did it go," I said "I think it went well.  I may have even answered one question with too much clarity" (laughter).  And but it-- so I entered graduate school in 1978 with a little bit of ambivalence and so, and, and part of it is, is that the ghosts of my family past were playing with my head at that point in time.  If there was a family business, it was education.  So my great-uncle Luke [ph.], my mom [Virginia Carr] and my aunt were both school teachers, and I was thinking all right I'm of a different generation and I should be doing something that they weren't able to do.  And while being a professor was at a higher level, it still was in education and I was a little ambivalent about whether or not I wanted to be in the family trade.  My brother's [Rudolph Lewis] studying to be an engineer and I thought, okay he's breaking out, he's doing something entirely different.  There's nobody else who has done that.  And so I was going through those own development questions about what I wanted to be and how I carved out my own mark.  By the end of my second year going into my third year of graduate school, I had come to realize actually I'm pretty, more than pretty good at this.  Two, I could get a Ph.D. and do so within a reasonable amount of time.  And three this was not what my mom and my aunt had done, let alone what my great-uncle had done, this is actually a brand new world and let me see if I can prove myself.  I had to apply then to get into the Ph.D. program.  That was not, Minnesota didn't have an automatic and so I applied and I was accepted and--
Speaker 2: So you applied, you were accepted, Joe is already, he's a year, Joe Trotter [Joe William Trotter, Jr.]--
Speaker 1: Joe, Joe was several years.  So I, when Joe graduated I, Joe would leave in 1980.  And so by the time I actually got into the Ph.D. program, Joe actually was teaching at Davis [University of California, Davis in Davis, California].
Story_ID: 106011
Speaker 1: So how many blacks are in your Ph.D. program [at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis, Minnesota]?
Speaker 2: One, two, me, over that period I was there, four, four because it was not just, it was the African Peoples Program that included Tiffany Patterson.  And, and Tiff and I spanned the whole arch, she was there before me and she was there after me.  Paul Barrows who was at Madison [University of Wisconsin-Madison in Madison, Wisconsin].  There was a young woman, Kimberly [ph.] who, who was in Latin America but would leave Minnesota and go somewhere else to get her Ph.D.  There was Ralph Crowder (unclear), and, and we would all overlap with one another but throughout.  And then there was a guy, I'm blanking on his name, who had transferred who was doing German, had transferred from Madison.  I can see him I just can't pull out his name.  But I don't think he ever finished either.  And so that's when Joe placed a bet on me and he was right.  I actually finished before any of the others.
Speaker 1: So of that number you finished before any of the others, how many finished the program?
Speaker 2: So Tiffany, it would take Tiffany, you probably know, it took, took Tiffany a while.  She probably finished twelve years later.  Paul would finish three or four years later.  Ralph would also going in and out but he would eventually finish.  But they would going in and out and I would be consistent, I would actually hang.  I actually worked two jobs and got my Ph.D.  I actually worked most of the six years teaching.  It was only one year out of the five-- of the six I didn't teach.  And then four out of the six years I worked for a private research company as a research assistant.  I (laughter) as I said to someone there was something about the work but also I wanted to live where I was not hand to mouth.  My parents [Virginia Carr and his step-father, Louis Carr] didn't the extra money.  I didn't wanna have a whole lot of loan debt, and so I just worked and, and that extra discipline of working just allowed me to cut out things that were superfluous.
Speaker 1: You know, that's interesting jut for context--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --because a lot of people that is not what they're, they're, they're not working--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and, and then there were the ones that never graduate, I mean they never got to the program--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --we were still doing research--
Speaker 2: (Unclear)
Speaker 1: --and whatever and--
Speaker 2: I--
Speaker 1: --and they get stuck.
Speaker 2: Well, I, I knew exactly how long I wanted to be at this and was determined, once I got to a point, in particular after I passed all of my exams and was then working on my project, and I go, "you know what, I can get support here," I got a, a handful of small fellowships along the way.  Twice the department nominated me for the top university fellowship and then twice I was turned down.  And I remember the second time it felt devastating 'cause I was the number one choice nominee from the History Department that year.  And Fred Lukermann, who was then the dean of, of the graduate school, wrote me a letter that said "Others made more compelling claims."  And I go, "Okay."  Man I don't know what to do with this.  So I borrowed.  I took out a loan for $5,000 and I borrowed some monies from some friends and said I would pay it back and went off to do my research and decided I'm gonna finish this somehow, someway, even without monies from the university.
Story_ID: 106012
Speaker 1: The next year I came back, I had got a bit of research and had been writing, and Minnesota [University of Minnesota in Minneapolis, Minnesota] found itself in a bind.  There was a faculty member who, it's on public record, who had been misbehaving for years and so they were going to fire their first tenured faculty member who also happened to be black.  I had worked for him as a research assistant and I know he was a scoundrel.  So I admit that, no other way to say it.  He, I worked for him and I'm a graduate student and he wrote me a check that bounced so high I thought it was it was gonna go into orbit.  And, and (laughter) so when the university came to me and said "Will you take on his courses?"  And, and I'm trying to finish writing my dissertation and I said well, let me go talk to the students first.  So I went and talked to the students and said "How often has Professor [George D.] King so showed up this quarter?" And we're in the second week, and they said he hasn't shown yet.  I said "Okay.  You guys are owed an education, I'll teach it."  And so I ended up teaching five classes that year while I'm writing my dissertation and I'm going out on the job market.  And--
Speaker 2: Earl, I've never heard a story like this.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I mean this is very atypical.
Speaker 1: (Unclear)
Speaker 2: I never heard a story like this.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  I--
Speaker 2: So you have great capacity?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Story_ID: 106013
Speaker 1: Now, but now who is your mentor?  'Cause you have to have a mentor.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.  No, I had a series of mentors, I mean so.  In graduate school [University of Minnesota in Minneapolis, Minnesota], I mean [Russell] Russ Menard who I had mentioned was a mentor.  Russ and I were, I mean he was a mentor and he was a friend.  And so he would call me over to his house and I would have dinner, he and, and his wife, Cathy [ph.], and my ex-wife and I would go over there and we would have dinner and hang out and just talk.  And, and he would introduce me to the chair of the Economics Department and then a whole range of other people.  So I actually got to know folks around campus.  Lansine Kaba who was still on the faculty at that point at Minnesota, Lansine was a mentor, and Lansine was the one who looked at me, I was joking with him just this past April, and said remember, I looked up and said, "You remember what you said to me one day." Yeah, I, I said "What's that?"  He said he looked at me after my second year and he goes, I'm tired of seeing you, I'm tired of, how did he say it?  "I'm tired of seeing you around."  I said, "What do you mean, Professor Kaba?" He goes "It's time for you to be finished and out of here."  And I said, and it was at that point I says, "It's just those words told me, you're fine.  I could finish and I have what was required to be an effective faculty member."  And so Lansine actually served as a mentor in a way.  In another area, Clarke Chambers who taught U.S. Social Welfare History, served as a mentor.  John Modell who was still, then on the faculty at Minnesota.  John was another mentor.  He, worked with me and teach me a lot of ways.  And so I was actually able to, to find at least five faculty members at Minnesota who I were to turn to for advice and support in different ways.  And then a woman, Marlys McPherson, who I worked for at Minnesota Mutual, sorry, the Minnesota Crime Prevention Center.  It was this, it was a company of about fifty people when I started working with them.  And by the end, there were six of us, but I was still one of the six.  And Marlys, she took this big company and brought it down to a smaller manageable research company.  I was one of the ones she kept along.  And, and, and I kept researching and working.  And so I ended up, and she became a friend as well.  So I ended up finding folks there.  And then I had friends in the community.  And so one of my best friends from Concordia [College in Moorhead, Minnesota] a guy named Eric Warren, me, and Eric is famous is now 'cause he's been on TV two or three times as a top chef.  He was on Oprah's [Oprah Winfrey] show ["Your OWN Show"] and he was on one of the top chef shows [sic, "Food Network Star"], but back in those days before he moved back to L.A. [Los Angeles, California], he was living in the Twin Cities [Minneapolis-St. Paul, Minnesota] working for Cargill selling salt by the barge load, and then he would move to St. Louis [Missouri] with his ex-wife, Alice (unclear) Warren.  But Eric and Alice and others made sure I knew people in the community and it, you know, it helped.  I could go in and out and hang out with people.  And then I had classmates too who ended up being friends, if not mentors.  And so I had a little community around that I could turn to and not lose my way and it, it all helped.  And so it was multiple mentors, not one person but I, I'd search them out in different ways.  Sometimes just going--there was a black owned barber shop I used to go to get my hair cut and it was this guy, I can't think, think of his name at this moment, but I can see him.  He was from Mississippi and he had moved up from Mississippi in the 1950s and settled in the Twin Cities and had a, a barber shop and you would sort of there and you go in and you talk to a cross section of people in those spaces.  And that was a way to be reanchored in the community.
Story_ID: 106014
Speaker 1: So all of those pieces came together for me in a way, and then at the end of this [University of Minnesota in Minneapolis, Minnesota], after working this five jobs the year I went out on the job market, and there were six jobs in my field, and I got called for three of 'em, Berkeley [University of California, Berkeley in Berkeley, California], Emory [University in Atlanta, Georgia], and University of West Virginia [Morgantown, West Virginia].  And I would go and give talks at all three and I would get job offers from all three.  And in some ways going back to that African Peoples course and that eight hour exam, because my ability to teach both African History as well as African American History, gave me an advantage at Berkeley over a lot of other people.  And once I got the Berkeley offer I took it and I, I realized that it had advantages over Emory at that point.  And West Virginia was, I said to some people later on, "I need to send you guys a little note.  You guys are the worst recruiters in the world" because they kept describing Morgantown as "a state of purgatory."  And everybody kept saying to me, you know, "I came here ten years ago and I didn't think I was gone stay here for than five years and wo, lo and behold I'm still here ten years later."  And I'm going "That's not a good ad for someone you're trying to recruit first, to say you didn't imagine you were gonna be here.  And two, oh my God it sticks like fly paper once you're here you can't get out."  And, and (laughter) so I, I thought no, I'm gone take that one off the list if I get another job offer.  And both the Emory job and the Berkeley job, and I thought, "I'm gonna go to Berkeley."
Story_ID: 106015
Speaker 1: So how, when did you decide on your doctoral thesis [at University of Minnesota in Minneapolis, Minnesota]?  That who was the, who is--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  So the doctoral thesis I ended up, the title of thesis was "At Work and At Home: Blacks in Norfolk, Virginia in--" 19-- it was either 1890 to 1945, I think it was "1890 to 1945." [sic, "1910-1945"]  I decided on that in, in part because I was influenced by Joe [Joe William Trotter, Jr.].  So Joe had already, I had read his dissertation on proletarianization in Milwaukee [Wisconsin] ["The Making of the Industrial Proletariat: Black Milwaukee, 1915-1945"].  He had given me a copy as soon as he and Ruth finished typing it.  And so I had a copy before most other people had ever seen it, let alone before it was published.  And, but I kept saying to, I said to Joe at that time, "That thesis works in the industrial North, it doesn't work in the South."  And I had concluded in reading the literature that really what was missing was an account of migration and urbanization in the urban South.  And so I started out actually, I was going to do a dissertation about Richmond [Virginia].  And, and then I was doing a literature review and I discovered that a woman named Elsa Barkley Brown was doing a dissertation on Richmond and that her advisor on paper was a guy named [August] Augie Meier.  And I thought well that's not smart.  Augie controls University of Illinois book series and, and almost everybody who publishes in black history at this particular point in time goes through Augie.  And I didn't know at that stage (laughter) Elsa's relationship with Augie.  But I thought, "You know I may need to find another city other Richmond."  And so, and that's when I settled on Norfolk [Virginia].  I said well I grew up there, people gone think it's because of that and I thought no it's because I had rule out Richmond because one of two Virginia cities, I wanted to do the upper South, I wanted to understand either a port city or an old industrial city in the South.  And so, excuse me, I ended up going to, to Norfolk and it's that part of actually looking at Norfolk and I go it's not proletarianization as Joe described it that's at play.  It's the interplay between what's happening at work and what I refer to as "what's happening at home."  And so I ended up working out that thesis in the case of the Norfolk situation and theorizing, hypothesizing whatever, that this is probably true in, in other urban settings as well.  And then as I transformed the dissertation into the book, "In Their Own Interests" I sort of tried to extend that argument in part and to understand it more.  But it really was me, my attempt to advance the literature in the ways in which Joe had reshaped and recast the literature and our conversations about African peoples in the industrial age.
Story_ID: 106016
Speaker 1: So this, this was a whole new sort of new area.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  It was (unclear) (simultaneous)
Speaker 1: Both of you [Lewis and Joe William Trotter, Jr.]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: In that way.  Its, is there any, you know, 'cause a lot of times with new areas either people are saying "That's not history" or that I mean "Why are you taking that approach?"
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: Was there any of that or was the academy pretty open, you know, to, to the concept because you're trying to prove a new concept where sometimes--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I mean we had we had our ups and downs.  Allan Spear, who was at Minnesota [University of Minnesota in Minneapolis, Minnesota] and Allan was on my dissertation and on Joe's dissertation, he was not teaching class as he was in the state legislature [Minnesota Senate] most of the time we were there.  But Allan thought in particular that Joe was a little harsh on, you know, many of the others who have framed the ghetto school.  And, and so I can remember going out to lunch with Allan after my defense and, and talking about it.  There was an openness but I can remember going through the book trying to place my dissertation in in a book, going with Augie [August Meier], and talking to Augie, and sending it to Augie.  And Augie, of course, (laughter) Augie was one unique human being.  That's all I, let's say that first.  And then two, he had his own thoughts about what the literature should look like and Elliot [Rudwick], his partner, had written this article on urban African American History in the doldrums, and that there were no new approaches, just as I was finishing up.  And so Joe and I both knew that at the very least, Augie and Elliott, in particular, believe there was space for new approaches.  And they had signed Joe, so Joe was one of the fortunate ones.  Joe, Joe's probably the only person that ever published in Augie's series twice.  And he, he got a contract with Augie right after he finished his dissertation, that too was rare.  And so I had actually written a piece and Augie wanted me to change both the introduction and some parts of the argument.  I changed the introduction and in hindsight I wish I hadn't.  I actually was ahead of a curve that would catch up to me and 'cause I had a whole introduction about (laughter) about race-making and how the theories of race and how you get at it and how study at work and home is also about how race making leads to people making and, in that process, being that place and, and Augie thought, "No, this is too far out there.  You should, you need to the take this out" and I did.  And years later I go, yeah, I shouldn't have listened to Augie at, at all.  It would have situated "In Their Own Interests" even more broadly than it was situated, but in, in the end, the community was receptive.  I mean there were people who sniped but for the most part the community was receptive.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now "In Their Own Interests." So "At Work and at Home: Blacks in Norfolk, Virginia, 1910 to 1945"--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --actually becomes "In Their Own Interests".
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, not everyone also is lucky to have a book come out of their doctoral thesis--
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: --I mean that--
Story_ID: 106017
Speaker 1: But the thing is, in the research that you're doing this is, are you learning Norfolk [Virginia] in a new way, you know, on Hampton Road [Virginia]?  That's, that's--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Now I it's one thing--
Speaker 1: --since you grew up.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  It's one thing to grow up some place but to be honest, now Virginia, at least when I grew up, you, you had to start taking Virginia History in the fourth grade.  So you took Virginia History in the fourth grade in the eighth grade and you had to take a third time before you graduated from high school.  So you were steeped in Virginia History and you had the same cycle for U.S. History and a little less for World History at least in those days.  But there was almost no accounting of local history of Norfolk, one.  And there was nothing written on African Americans in Norfolk at that particular point in time.  And so my attempt to piece this story together and tell it, was not only new for me it was new for most of the people I talked to 'cause they had, they had gone through or remembered it as a historical narrative about what happened and how it changed over time.  People would have fragments.  And so I learned a whole lot.  I mean there's no one in my family, once I gave them the document and they could try to read through it, there were few people in family knew the history as I came to know the history.
Story_ID: 106018
Speaker 1: And, were you doing, so you were doing research in the libraries there [Norfolk, Virginia]--
Speaker 2: (Nodding)
Speaker 1: And you also, were you doing interviews?
Speaker 2: I did a few interviews.  I did research in the libraries both in Norfolk [Virginia], in Richmond [Virginia], over at Hampton [Institute, now Hampton University, in Hampton, Virginia], a lot in Washington, D.C.  Meaning one of my favorite stories is the fact, those were the innocent days of doing work in the National Archives [Washington, D.C.] and the where the archivists, literally would open the door and say and "Go look and see what you can find."  And there's this one box to this day I could not find it.  I mean I found it the first time and thought I had, you know, noted with great diligence the, where it was and all, and I couldn't find it the next time.  And in, and by that time they had examples of people who had gone in and were stealing things and selling them, and so it became more difficult to go and roam in the back room.  And one of the curators I had been working with had retired and all.  And then they were data there that were in raw form, that had not been put into a tape and I wanted to analyze some of these and I was social historian so I had quantitative skills as well, and so trying to figure out what I could lent to my quantitative skills and analyses verses just being able to tell the narrative in a literature part so.  It, I searched all over, I was at the, there were materials at UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles] in the [Ralph J.] Bunche papers.  'Cause [Gunner] Myrdal and Bunche had done some work of interviewing people about contemporary things in the 1930s Norfolk and that were in files, the FBI or the precursor to the FBI and the military intelligence had been surveilling black citizens in Norfolk during World War I and around, so those files became particularly important as they would again for World War II.  And Norfolk was the site for Supreme Court related matters and related to black school teachers and the battle over equal pay.  And so the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] papers and the Library of Congress were important.  So what I realized is that there were piles or collections of papers all over.  And then there was the Norfolk Journal and Guide, the black newspaper.  And the best thing that ever happened to me which allowed me to finish, is that the Center for Research Libraries in Chicago [Illinois], and years later I would serve on their board because, I, I owed them a debt, sent me all the reals of Norfolk Journal and Guide that they had, that had been microfilmed and, I-- John Modell one of my mentors, had his microfilm reader, they had a portable one which he gave to, and loaned to me for a half a year.  And so I would sit at home and crank through the Norfolk Journal and Guide and be able to take copious notes and, and if I needed to print something out, I would flag it and take it over to the university and print it out, those copies.  But it allowed me to, the, the piece that I did, so one of the first articles that I wrote when I was junior faculty member at Berkeley [University of California, Berkeley in Berkeley, California], was on black visiting patterns.  And what I did was sample, it was 840 of the visiting columns in the newspapers and "Mrs., Ms., and Mrs. Richardson came from Chicago, Illinois to visit their niece in Norfolk for the last week."  And so I thought, I kept looking at these going, there's a story here.  And so I ended up sampling then 1916, '17 [1917], 1921, and 1925 to get some change over time, and then a random sample about 840 and submitted them and put 'em in an SBSS format and analyzed them to see what patterns materialized.  And so it's the first article on black visiting patterns that was ever created but it was that ability to have the microfilm reader in the first place to begin this, as your turning you're starting to see something over and over again and going there's a story here, it's not the story you think you're looking at but there's a story here and having the imagination to figure out what that story is.
Story_ID: 106019
Speaker 1: Now did your quantitative skills come out of, of psychology?  I'm just, is it typical that historian or scholars in the academy would have have quan, would take a quantitative approach?  And then where does social history come in that because it's a new discipline too?
Speaker 2: So Minnesota [University of Minnesota in Minneapolis, Minnesota] was at the center of social history and quantitative history.  And so in my time, in Minnesota you had to have two languages.  But one of those languages could be stats [statistics] and quantitative reasoning.  And so I ended up deciding then, okay I was gonna take stats and quantitative reasoning.  I passed out of Spanish and then I had taken courses in stats as undergraduate.  I had taken a course in experimental psychology as an undergraduate.  So that was some part of the background.  Then John Modell taught a course in historical quantitative reasoning.  That was a two quarter course and so I took two quarters with him.  And then I went over, actually to the Stats Department and took a series of courses on multi-variable analysis in the Stats Department as a graduate student, so that I would have more sophisticated skills.  And but, it was the way in which social history was being taught at Minnesota, which is to say it's not only from the bottom up but there are structures and systems that you can analyze and there are these various tools that you can use to begin to analyze them.  And, and I was encouraged.  And there were a few of us, I mean I (unclear) in, I probably went farther, I and my friend Jon Gjerde who both of us ended up getting our first jobs at Berkeley [University of California, Berkeley in Berkeley, California].  And John would tragically die a few years ago of-- when the electrical pulse to his heart stopped.  But Jon he was, he was exercising one day.  He told his wife he was up stairs and when she went up to get him.  He clearly had finished 'cause she had talked to him just before he, after he finished and he sat down to cool down and the pulse just stopped.
Speaker 1: (Unclear)
Speaker 2: Fifty-three years old and the kind of thing and so.  But John and I were friends in graduate school.  He had gone on even more so, for he had gone to Caltech [California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, California] for a two year post doc to even-- develop even more sophisticated quantitative skills, and then come to Berkeley.  And he wrote on the migration of Norwegian immigrants and establishment of European Norwegian or European Scandinavian communities in the United States.  But there's a group of us in and around Minnesota who studied movement migration and all, and I did, Joe [Joe William Trotter, Jr.] did, John did, we were from different perspectives.  And that was actually exciting 'cause we could talk to one another in and across field and boundaries and, and we would come to help one another at different stages in our lives.
Story_ID: 105567
Speaker 1: But no, it-- learning, thinking about story and audience and, and part over the, the fun part of over career, I did the Norfolk [Virginia] book and then I decided, I can do all kinds of different books after that and so, mean compare "In Their Own Interests" to "Love on Trial" which is a completely different.
Speaker 2: It, it's amazing.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I mean you've, I'm telling you, I was totally captivated with that.  And I wanna talk to you about that but I would, but let, let's--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --go to Berkeley [University of California, Berkeley in Berkeley, California].
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: So you're at Berkeley, and you get, so Berkeley is a prime, so--
Speaker 1: (Laughter)
Speaker 2: Did you get your jobs because you lectured at those places or did you get the jobs through the organization American Histor--
Speaker 1: (Shaking head no.)
Speaker 2: And so you--
Speaker 1: I, yeah, so I did not, I, I never was part of the meat market of the AHA [American Historical Association].  So I got once, got called to go to the AHA for an interview, a job interview and I didn't go.  And God knows I'm so glad I didn't.  It was Dartmouth [College in Hanover, New Hampshire].  And it was Dartmouth in the dark and wooly days of Dartmouth trying to figure out how to desegregate, so this is like 1983.  Elsa [Barkley Brown] went and we joked about it later and--
Speaker 2: It hasn't changed.
Speaker 1: It hasn't changed much at all.  And so I ended up interviewing at Berkeley.  I applied and I can still remember, I applied at Berkeley and I didn't think I had much of a chance right, 'cause there's no one from Minnesota [University of Minnesota in Minneapolis, Minnesota] had been considered for a job at Berkeley in recent years.  So but I thought I'm, I'm gonna apply.  And I get a call.  And I remember I think I almost floated down the stairs (laughter) as I was running down to tell [Russell] Russ Menard.  I said, "Russ" and he was Department Chair at that point.  I bust in there, and burst through the door and my, the secretary was like what, "What are you doing, Earl?"  I said, "I gotta find Russ.  I really need to find Russ."  And she said "Okay, what?"  I said, and I walked in and said, "You're not gonna believe it but I just a call from Berkeley they want me to come up for a job interview."  And, and he said, "Great."  And so he and a few of the, Stuart Schwartz, whose now at Yale [University in New Haven, Connecticut] who went to Latin Americas and a few others they said, "Okay. How can we help you?"  I said, "Set up a practice interview for me."  So they did, they set up a practice interview for me.  So I actually gave a talk, and they critiqued it.  They asked me questions as if I were a job candidate and then they prepared me.  And I thought I got something special which really should have been routine for everyone but in part I learned to ask, and sometimes asking people will step up.  And I, and I think back on it now and I go, woah, that helped.  Because when I got to Berkeley, it was not like this is the first time I was doing it.  I had done it in front of the other group of faculty who were friends but who were critics to, before.  And, in fact, the funniest part I, I fly out to Berkeley for this job interview and Joe's [Joe William Trotter, Jr.] at Davis [University of California, Davis in Davis, California], and Joe comes "Earl," and I, and I told him.  He says, "Well I'll come and see you for and you got any gaps in your schedule?"  I said, "Yeah, between here and here I have a gap but I have to show up for a dinner."  He said "Okay.  Let me come and get you and I'll take you over to San Francisco [California]." And, and I didn't know at that time how directionally challenged my friend Joe is (laughter).  And so I mean over the years I've just gotten to the point, let me drive and I (laughter) 'cause I, but we get over to San Francisco, we get there eventually but then we're trying to get back and I'm like, this is before cell phones and I know I'm about to be late for the dinner and (laughter) that's going to determine whether or not I get this job (laughter).  And though sure enough we were a little late.  [Reginald] Reggie Jones who was then Chair of the African American Studies Department at, at Berkeley was kind, and Charles Henry, and my friend [HM] Charles Henry and him also.  They, they were kind but they laughing he says, "All right rule is don't go out with friends who will get lost and cost you your job" (laughter).  And I-- and Joe felt so bad.  He was like, "Can I go in and tell them it was my fault and that I had sort of kidnapped you and then and all?" so.  It was (unclear) but I gotta sit here and go "Oh, man I may have blown this one big time."  But it turns out, no.
Story_ID: 105568
Speaker 1: But it was interesting because they would say to me later, says, "Earl you're the first person from a place like Minnesota [University of Minnesota in Minneapolis, Minnesota] we've considered.  I mean, we typical hire from Yale [University in New Haven, Connecticut], Harvard [University in Cambridge, Massachusetts], and Princeton [University in Princeton, New Jersey] and, and fourth on that list would be Columbia [University in New York City, New York], and so, unless you come from Berkeley [University of California, Berkeley in Berkeley, California] itself."  And so I, I'm going "Well, I appreciate the fact."  And it was the job, I was gonna occupy the job that Al [Albert J.] Rabateau had vacated.  So I was Al's replacement and Al had come from Princeton and gone back to Princeton.  And so in that sense I thought, okay.  I'm glad they took a chance on a kid from Norfolk [Virginia] who went to Concordia [College in Moorhead, Minnesota] and made his way to Minnesota and I get to come to Berkeley.  And, and I got there in what was for me a great time.  The, I had a new set mentors, my official mentor was Leon Litwack but actually my best mentor was Larry, Larry really, Levine [Lawrence Levine], really adopted me in, and he was one who helped me get my book contract with California [University of California Press] and worked with me.  He was the one who, he was the one who had to read my dissertation and to say I should, my title should change from "acting assistant professor" to "assistant professor."  But, but, I became friends with Ron Takaki and Ron gave me advice and actually some of the most important advice that I ever would have.  But as I thinking about this, trying to place my first book he goes, he stopped by my office one day and we were on the same hall and he goes "So how are you doing?"  I said "Well, I had just had this thing interaction with Augie [August Meier] and I'm trying to figure out how to best to, who to go to next 'cause Augie wants me to make changes I don't wanna make."  And he said, "Well it's your book."  And then he looked at me and said, "Are you sending it to them one at a time?"  I said, "Yeah."  He said "they all say they want right of first refusal."  He said, "Earl send it to him this way, send it to one, one day, send to the other one the next day, send it to the next one the third day and tell them they all get the right of first refusal if they're first" (laughter).  And, and that was the best advice, 'cause I had, no one else had said that to me.  So I was going to take three, send it to someone there within three or four months and then, of course, the time is ticking.  And when Ron said this, I go "Okay.  I'll send it then to-" and I ended, subsequently I would send it to Chapel Hill [University of North Carolina Press], and I would send it to, to California.  And I explained to [Lewis] Lou Bateman who was the editor at Chapel Hill and to Sheila Levine who was the editor at California where we were.  And, you know, and Lou came back and says "I'm prepared to give you a contract but only after you made these changes."  And Sheila says "We'll give you a contract, its conditional but to be honest all contracts are conditional if you read all the clauses."  And, and I said "Okay, I'll publish with California."  And, and so I had my contract that was probably in, by 1988.  I had gotten there, I graduated December of '84 [1984], I had showed up at Berkeley in January of '85 [1985].  And so I had a contract by '88 [1988] and made the revision maybe even earlier '87 [1987], '88 [1988], somewhere in that period.  I finished the book ["In Their Own Interests"] the summer of '89 [1989] right after I moved from Berkeley to Michigan.  And, and then it would take, and California apologized to-- for the next twenty years, it would then take them two years to get it out of production.  Something happened with their production editor and, and all.  And so the book was to have come out in 1990, it didn't come out 'til 1991.
Story_ID: 105569
Speaker 1: Fortunately for me, they [University of California Press] put it ["In Their Own Interests"] on their cover, so it was their cover book for that year [1991].  And then I got the attention and I got oh, positive, very, very positive reviews in all but one and that was in the Journal of Southern History.  And that was someone who never wanted me to write the book.  And so that was Henry Lewis Suggs and I had a disagreement over whether or not I should ever write this book.  And Henry got to write the review for the Journal of Southern History which I thought was a conflict.  I wouldn't review his book 'cause I thought we had a conflict.  He didn't have the same belief.
Speaker 2: So why didn't he want you to write the book?
Speaker 1: I, I don't know the full answer to that question.  I met Henry in probably 1982 the first time.  He was at Howard [University in Washington, D.C.] at that stage, and he was writing a, what I thought the biography of P. B. Young, the editor of the Norfolk Journal and Guide.  And so I reached out to him because I was looking at these visiting patterns and I had a question for him, a technical question, as I was trying to figure out how to make use and analyze.  He took me out to lunch and we had, and I was happy because I, I living at the Y and on a hundred dollars a week and somebody to give me a good meal, I was more than happy to see them.  But after I got back he wrote a letter to the chairman of the History Department [at University of Minnesota in Minneapolis, Minnesota] suggesting that I should be encouraged to think about a different topic.  And, and suggested other cities and towns that I could study because there was nothing new I could say about Norfolk because he was doing one piece and Tommy, Tommy Lee Bogger who was at Norfolk State [University in Norfolk, Virginia] was gonna do something else, and there may have been a third person.  I ignored him.  I wrote him back, my committee wrote him back and says, "Well, why don't you send this-- here's what we'll do, you send up the outline of what it is you plan to do and we'll make sure he doesn't do any of that."  That was the end of it.  Years later an anonymous letter would show up via the history department, to the history department colleagues at, at Michigan [University of Michigan in Ann arbor, Michigan] after my book came out and I am led to believe it was, it was from Henry but--
Speaker 2: And it said what?
Speaker 1: Essentially that I, these were never, none of these were my ideas.  They were, (laughter) and that I had essentially in taken other people's ideas and et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.  And I thought, in so far as I know, I don't think he's an urban historian.  And, and the only reason I actually several, I and several friends thought 'cause one of our colleague had gotten a letter from him signed by him and the typewriter looked very much the same and they both were at that point from this place in Virginia.  Who knows?  In the end some friends simply told me to ignore it.  And Richard Black had said to me and I think Richard said, "Earl, if you don't get one bad review, you're ahead of most of us."  And, and the editor of the Journal of Southern History actually apologized later.  He should have figured out that this was not the best person to review it.
Speaker 2: Right. And that there was somewhat of a conflict?
Speaker 1: There was a somewhat of a conflict, yeah, there.
Speaker 2: Now what is the, and that's sort of politics of academia, right, right, right. (simultaneous)
Speaker 1: Exactly. Exactly
Story_ID: 105570
Speaker 1: So what, what you said, in fact, I have to tell you this, [HM] Charles Henry I grew up.
Speaker 2: Oh okay.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, okay.
Speaker 1: Yes.  In Newark, Ohio.  His, my father [HM Julius Richardson] was his mentor.
Speaker 2: Is that right?
Speaker 1: And I didn't know that, I didn't know the connection until I was reading the foreword to the book and I was like, 'cause you talked about, you know, your three on three games.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.  We played Charles and I played tennis together, basketball and I've seen and talked him even as recently as last year or so.
Speaker 1: So now what is the, you said also that the hardest decision you made was leaving Berkeley [University of California, Berkeley in Berkeley, California].  But what did, what did you mean by that and how did the Berkeley experience differ from your Minnesota [University of Minnesota in Minneapolis, Minnesota] experience?
Speaker 2: Me at that point at Berkeley I could have stayed and had a lovey career at, at Berkeley.  I mean just the physical environment alone.  Jayne London my ex-wife--
Speaker 1: Now when did you get married too?
Speaker 2: So we got married in 1984.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We got married before--
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: So we got married in July of 1984 before we moved--
Speaker 1: To Berkeley.
Speaker 2: To Berkeley.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And--
Speaker 1: So you met her in Minnesota?
Speaker 2: We met in Minnesota, and we moved out to Berkeley together, my daughter was born out in the Bay Area [California].
Speaker 1: Suzanne is her--
Speaker 2: Suzanne [Lewis] is my daughter.  So Suzanne was born in 1986.  And so we had moved to the Bay area.  We were renting this brand new townhouse in what was in, what is now Emeryville [California], literally across the street.  It's one of those parts of Bay Area, on one of the street it was Oakland, the other side of the street it was Emeryville.  And so we had a place there.  So Jane and I actually, both thought, you know, we can, we can make this work.  Jon Gjerde who I, I referenced a few minutes ago, his wife, Ruth, we were all friends.  We were friends in Minneapolis and we both ended up on the faculty at Berkeley together and we were friends there.  Ruth took care of Suzanne in the first six months after she was born.  So Jane (ph.) was working still full time and John and, and Ruth had two daughters who were two and four years older than Suzanne and so we have friends there.
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 2: And so it was hard in the sense that I'd gotten tenure.  I mean I actually had gotten tenured at Berkeley.  I mean part of the offer from Michigan [University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, Michigan] was to accelerate a decision at Berkeley, and Berkeley offered me tenure.  And so I actually, I would--
Speaker 1: 'Cause so Berkeley wanted to keep you (unclear) (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: They wanted to keep me.  They were convinced they wanted to keep me.  They wanted me to remain a member of the faculty and they, (laughter) ironically they offered me an administrative posting, even gave me more money and I thought "I don't wanna be an administrator" (laughter) and said, "No."  But Jane and I, I recall to this, to this day, we ended up going to this restaurant called I think its Skates [Skates on the Bay], but it, it, it's on the Berkeley Pier.  You look out and you can see at least three, if not four bridges when it's clear.  We order a bottle of wine and a full meal and decide we're gone take our time and talked through the pros and cons of going to Michigan verses us staying at Berkeley.  And if at the end of this bottle of wine and seeing the sun set going across the back silhouette in the, the Bay Bridge, if we can agree to leave, then it's the right decision.  And when we actually weighed through the pros and cons and thought about it, while it was a tough decision, we thought it was the right decision.  It was a tough decision in, in part because we realized that being at Berkeley for a career with the range of people and the kinds of graduate students and all, you know.  Top-- Jane had a job and working in a development operation there and she, she could have gone on to do a, a range of other things at, at Berkeley.  But Michigan offered something that we came to see that Berkeley didn't offer.  One, it was closer to family.  And to be quite honest Jane's family, and she grew up in, in a Jewish family up in New England.  I grew up in a family in Norfolk [Virginia].  My brother [Rudolph Lewis], where is my brother at that point?  My brother was in New York at that point in time.  My parents [Virginia Carr and his step-father, Louis Carr] are still in Virginia.  And so for my daughter to see her family, was an effort.  So I would, every year make sure that either parents came out to California or I got out, took her out to Virginia and all.  But I thought, you know, there's a way from Michigan.  We could actually drive if, and we did to either New England or Virginia and do it in a day, which we did in most cases.  So that was one piece.
Story_ID: 105571
Speaker 1: But the other part about, in the end, while it was tough but the right decision: California's [University of California, Berkeley in Berkeley, California] budget system didn't make any sense to me.  I mean they had these wild swings.  And Michigan [University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, Michigan] at that point had decided to fit a line, and while there were gonna be some challenges it was gonna fit a line.  And then the people at the University of Michigan were the smartest recruiters around.  And so they did something that Berkeley never saw fit to do.  So one of the people I meet when I was on my recruiting trip to, to Michigan rather was Jim Duderstadt who was then president of the University of Michigan.  And Jim told me not only the university's vision but how he saw me fitting into the university's vision, and that if I came, that I would access to the president's office for the kinds of things that I want to do.  I didn't know at that point that not only was that true but I was gonna want access to the president's office for the kinds of things that I wanted to do.  Mike Heyman [Ira Michael Heyman] was then the chancellor at Berkeley.  I had met Mike, but Mike wouldn't have known me from any other junior faculty member on campus.  And I realized that I also probably could afford, the cost of living in Ann Arbor, while not cheap, but still much more affordable than in the Bay Area.  I wouldn't have to, unless I wanted to, to send my kid to private school because the public schools worked well.  I could have other space.  And what I didn't know until I got to Michigan, I would be able to recruit some of the best graduate students in the world and, and we were and then able to recruit, and this is where access to the president's office made sense, able to recruit Robin Kelley and Elsa Barkley Brown to join me on the faculty, and we built the top program in African American History for a period of time in the country.  And we have students now who are full professors all over, who came through.  And so when I made that move in 1989, '90 [1990] didn't know what the next ten years will look like, let alone the next 20 years.  So while it was tough, it definitely was the right decision.
Speaker 2: Right.  And you so, you make the decision in, in the fall or the spring of 19--
Speaker 1: We made it in the spring of 1989.
Speaker 2: 9.  And so by 19, by the fall you were--
Speaker 1: Yeah, so--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: We, we drove Jane [London] and I and Suzanne [Lewis] took our Honda Accord and we drove from California to Michigan tag teaming with our friends Ruth and Jon Gjerde and their daughters.  And so we, we camped out across America all the way up.
Speaker 2: You mean all of you, both of you went?
Speaker 1: Yeah they--
Speaker 2: The same year?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  So they decided they were going back home to see family in Iowa.
Speaker 2: I see.  Okay.
Speaker 1: And so they said, "Why don't we go out together?  We'll ride with you and keep you company as you move to Michigan."  And so we hung out, it was fun.  I mean we got the, my first trip Vegas [Las Vegas, Nevada] and, and camping out in Zion [Zion National Park] and the whole range of other things I would never have seen.  I, probably the only time I would ever think about camping in Utah.  But Jon and Ruth mapped out a route, and we took the girls and their car and, and our car and their dog and we made it across the country.  And so we got there then in July of '89 [1989].  And, the a few months before the major earthquake in '89 [1989].
Speaker 2: You left just in time.
Speaker 1: I did.  And--
Speaker 2: So was it, you said the ups and downs of, of the U Cal system, was that also, the propositions starting at that point?  They hadn't started yet?
Speaker 1: They had, they had already had a early prop, so prop, the Prop 2, whichever the prop (unclear) now in the beginning, but the one that actually changed their tax structure--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --had already been introduced.  And it was already in effect.  And other props would show up.  But part of it was, is that California had no way to regulate the income, and so there would be some years when they would have a bust and other years they have a boom.  And the years when they have a boom there was, by state law for some reason they would be sending you money back.  And I remember one year they said "we're gonna send every resident of the state a hundred dollar check back."  I said, "Keep the hundred dollars 'cause you're gone need it next season."  And sure enough as soon as they wrote the checks and sent it to us, they were calling 'em back and asking for the hundred dollars back 'cause they now had a deficit.  And I'm like this part makes no sense.  And this was where my quantitative skills came in, I, I looked at Jon and I said, should we call 'em up?  'Cause we can fit a line.  We can show them how much range they should have, and, and what they should do.  But we were the only, we were the academics.
Story_ID: 105572
Speaker 1: So how did the, how did the faculty differ at Michigan [University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, Michigan] and what are you coming into at this (unclear) (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: So I'm coming into the History Department and the Center for African American/African Studies [sic, Center for Afroamerican and African Studies, now the Department of Afroamerican and African Studies] at the University of Michigan in 1989.  The faculty at Michigan--
Speaker 1: And it is a department?
Speaker 2: Its--
Speaker 1: It's not a program--
Speaker 2: No--
Speaker 1: --it's a department.
Speaker 2: It's a center.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It's a center for, and so at Berkeley--
Speaker 1: 'Cause these things are important.
Speaker 2: --at Berkeley [University of California, Berkeley in Berkeley, California] it was a department.  At Michigan it was a center.  As a center it had all of the features of the department except for the right to grant tenure or, or to advance tenure independently.  So it had a budget, it had a degree in the curriculum, it had faculty, it had space, we all of those things.  The only thing we weren't able to do as a center is to say that we wanted to independently review someone for tenure.  I, I would get that changed, but that's wasn't the case when I arrived in 1989 and.
Speaker 1: So you arrive and you're assistant, assist--
Speaker 2: As associate professor.
Speaker 1: You're associate professor.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I came, I came to Michigan with tenure.  I was not gonna leave.  I got tenured at Berkeley, I was not leaving.  And so I was the tenured faculty member now.  And what I didn't know is, when I arrived in the center (laughter) Ali Mazrui would leave.  As I would walk in one door, Ali Mazrui would leave and go out the other door.  The same thing with Walter Allen, and Walter would go to UCLA [University of California in Los Angeles, California].  Allen-- Ali would go, to Binghamton [University in Binghamton, New York].  And so I came in as a newly tenured associate professor and now--
Speaker 1: You're the only one there.
Speaker 2: I'm, you know.  Michael Dawson is there.
Speaker 1: Oh, Michael Dawson is there.
Speaker 2: Michael is there, but Michael is not tenured at that point and time.  Lemuel Johnson, who is now deceased, but Lem, in literature Lem never-- his appointment was a hundred percent in English but he was acting as the director of the Center for African American/African Studies.  There was a guy, Teshome Wagaw who was joined between the School of Education and the Center.  And then one, a woman, Gracia Clark, who anthropologist, who was joined between anthropologist and, and the Center.  Michael Awkward who would be joined between English and the Center, but Michael wasn't tenured at that point either.  And so I come in really as the only tenured person, 'cause Lem was about to go on leave.  Teshome was on leave, and I go wow, okay.  This is not the place I thought I was going.  Oh, and then Harold, had Harold retired?  Harold Cruse, I think Harold had just retired.  So Harold was still around.  I loved Harold.  Harold was still around.
Speaker 1: Who had developed a whole reputation for himself.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  And a persona that he created and if he didn't create it he would, would have created it (laughter).  And, and so I, I got there thinking I was leaving Berkeley and not going into an administrative role and within a short time of getting to Michigan, within months I was asked to be the interim director of the Center, really within four months.
Story_ID: 105573
Speaker 1: But you didn't know this about yourself bus you were very good at administration.
Speaker 2: I did not know it at the time [1989] but I am I, I was, I turned out to be good at administration.  And, and what I ended up explaining to myself for that period in time, was that I liked administration for-- once I got into it because I realized I could make a decision in the morning that had consequences by the afternoon, that would make a difference in someone's life.  And I lived in an economy that was so much about deferred gratification.  I write a piece, it would take six month to a year, to a year and half before it would show up in print.  By the time it showed up in print, I'm going "Oh, I wrote that."  I mean it was just that cold.  Whereas I knew if I made a decision that morning, it was done, and, and it was immediate.  And I thought I sort of like that balance between some deferred gratification and some immediate gratification.
Speaker 1: So what, what do you, what is your ideas about what you wanna do with the Center [Center for Afroamerican and African Studies at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, Michigan]?  I mean, and then how, how long does it take to make that a department.  I mean, you know(simultaneous)
Speaker 2: Yeah, so the Center.  I actually, so on the department front I actually wasn't so convinced that it needed to become a department.  I thought that really what it needed to do, is have the right to grant tenure into, independently or, or recommend tenure independently.  And so I set upon trying to get that changed.  Mean, in fact I held on to the idea that it needed to be a department.  It became a department post-20--, was I there, 2009.  Finally it went it from CAAS [Center for Afroamerican and African Studies] to DAAS [Department of Afroamerican and African Studies].  And I didn't want to give up, I mean well, there's the intellectual debate.  And so there was a whole question about whether African Studies should pulled out and it becomes the center of the department for African American studies.  And I fought the whole time I was there to have it the Center for African American and African studies, arguing that it really is the African diaspora--
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: That is the frame and that we should be utilizing, rather than this sort of colonial notion that there are African American people and then there are the African folks.  When it became DAAS circa 2009, they pulled out African studies and put it somewhere else on campus.  I told my friends in Michigan I'm still pissed about that but sometimes you realize you can only fight the wars you wanna fight for so long and, and.  But the I, I do realize that Harold [Cruse], so going back to Harold.  Harold was the director of CAAS at one point in his--.  And Harold had this notion that, and he would tell me this, he said, "Earl, I just told people stuff.  They never checked to see whether it was true" (laughter) and so he made this claim about the value of African American studies as compared to African studies and that Michigan shouldn't have a full-fledged African study because that's what Michigan State [University in East Lansing, Michigan] does and that and so we'll some teaching in African studies but we won't do ABC and D.  And so I got there asking why are we doing ABC and D and it was the Harold Cruse principle that was in place.  No one understood that Harold was being Harold and if you called him on it he would tell you "yeah, I just bluffed but no one called my hand and we've been acting this way for twenty years."  So my goal was to try to figure out how to actually think about the African diaspora and could we begin to put together a center and a center structure that brought people in who actually talked across, and could we anchor certain critical programs in the Center.  So my colleagues, Tom Holt [HM Thomas C. Holt], but over time would leave to go to [University of] Chicago [Chicago, Illinois], Rebecca Scott and [Frederick] Fred Cooper, Fred would ultimately leave and come up here to NYU [New York University in New York City, New York], but they had a program called Post-Emancipation Societies and they had graduate students and visitors and they had gotten monies and et cetera and this was before Tom and Rebecca both won MacArthurs [MacArthur Fellowship] in the same year.  And so the Post-Emancipation Societies Program [sic, Post-Emancipation Societies Project] was in the Center.  So I came in and I thought what happens after post-emancipation, right?  And so is the creation of the industrial age, and so the companion research project to post-emancipation should be "African Peoples in the Industrial Age."  So I go about then trying to find monies from Ford and Rockefeller and elsewhere to anchor programs in the Center for African Peoples in the Industrial Age.  And I get a grant from Rockefeller, had, the Center already had a grant from Ford just as I arriving, and we turned it to begin to create a whole set of visits and, and bringing in graduate students who would explore some aspects of life of African Peoples in the Industrial Age.  And that was my vision and fortunately was able to get the monies.  Now what I was not successful in doing, is getting enough of my colleagues, this is my one lament, that I couldn't get as many of my colleagues as I would have liked to have been entrepreneurs for the Center as much as they were entrepreneurs for themselves.  And so I said, look you guys go out and write grants to get yourself released from teaching and do ABC and D, why don't you write two or three grants that actually comes to the Center where you actually take that  research and it comes back in.  And that was harder to actually get because so many of the faculty thought of themselves as not a part of a Center but a department where they didn't have to write grants because the, in a departmental culture, no I mean unless you're in the sciences, that's not what you do.  In a Center culture yeah, you should be getting external dollars.  So I got the dollars, I got the grants, I got very few people to replicate my activities and then I cycled out.  The I was able to keep some things going because my graduate students kept it going.  And I got them monies and then got a lot of them to keep the African Peoples in the Industrial Age Project going for a decade.
Story_ID: 106020
Speaker 1: So 1991 "In Their Own Interests" comes and, and people start to pay attention.  I had in a series of articles that had come in different ways as well.  But my, I, I knew my stature had risen a little bit when I got a call one day out of the blue from, Nancy Toff who is an editor at Oxford University Press.  And Nancy said, "Earl, may I come to see you?"  And I was at that point still directing the Center for African American, African Studies [sic, Center for Afroamerican and African Studies at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, Michigan] probably in 1992, '93 [1993].  I said, "Sure.  What do you wanna talk about?"  She says, "Well, I wanna do this multivolume history of African Americans for young adults.  And I wondered would you edit it.  Would you be the one to assemble the team to produce these volumes" and I, and I started laughing.  I says, "So I've now reached an age of maturity where this is possible."  That there had been other points in my life, where things were coming and people were saying, "Earl, you're still too young to do AB, to, to do something."  So Nancy came and we talked and I said I'll, "I'll do it but let me see if I get Robin," by this time Robin [D.G.] Kelley had, had joined the faculty at, at Michigan.
Speaker 2: So you recruited him as a student then he joined--
Speaker 1: No, I recruited him as a faculty member.
Speaker 2: As a faculty member?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  So Robin had been a, Robin and I had met at a conference in, in the 1990s thereabouts 1991.  And we were talking and I said, "Would you ever consider leaving," he was at Emory [University in Atlanta, Georgia] actually, "would you ever consider leaving Emory and coming to Michigan.  I've gotten approval from the president of the university and the dean that I can hire at least two other African American historians.  And, and I like to think about you joining me and we can build."  And he said "Sure."  At that point he says, "and what do you think if we invited Elsa [Barkley Brown] as well?"  And so at that moment I, Robin and then Elsa and (unclear) I think (unclear) had just come out or was just about to, no it had just come out by the time Robin appeared.  And so we were all three of us end up there.  But so Nancy comes, and I said well, let me turn to Robin and so Robin and I decided, "Okay we'll do this."  And so we become the general editors of this eleven-volume history as it turns out, of African Americans for young adults ["The Young Oxford History of African Americans"].  Excuse me.  And that's when I realized okay, my stature in the academy and in my field it, it's growing.  In between, Joe Trotter [Joe William Trotter, Jr.] and I would do a documentary volume on African Americans in the Industrial Age in, in documents.  And we, Robin and I then put together this volume, and that volume garnered a lot of attention and we decided we could repackage that in ten volumes, the 11th volume was an appendix, so 10 volumes into a new book, "To Make The World Anew."  And so we recrafted it into a single volume.  And, and now we sell them as split volumes part-- volume one and volume two.  That helped to reshape ways of thinking about African Americans, not only in the U.S. but in the global sense.
Story_ID: 106021
Speaker 1: That parallels with some changes in the African American studies, because what had been argued is, is that African American studies is at the forefront of really a multi-disciplinary approach to knowledge.  And that you have to begin to sort of say that if you gonna ask questions, it, it can't be just a single disciplinary approach that will allow you to get a handle on the particulars of those questions.  And so to have a literary scholar sitting next to a psychologist talking to a historian who then informs a political scientist, actually begins to enrich and give you a deeper sense of the lived experience.  And so in some ways when we think about African American studies as a field, it really begins to instantiate the whole notion of what will become inter-disciplinary.  And in those early days, I mean from its marginal place in the academy, excuse me, its marginal place in the academy where you end up with some schools questioning whether this is legitimate scholarship and all.  To, if you think of some of the most important books that have been written in almost every major field of the humanities and the social sciences, it has, touches upon in some form or another some aspect of the African American experience.  And that was a major transformation that I got to witness and to be a part of.
Story_ID: 106022
Speaker 1: And by the time-- ten years at Michigan [University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, Michigan] I, we got in the college of Arts and Sciences to allow both women's studies and African American studies to administer tenured decisions independent of a department because we could show that in effect there was a body of scholarship that was expansive and deep, and that it had really helped to reshape the ways of knowing.  It took ten years but I kept saying to people "I'm here for a while so and we'll stay at it."
Speaker 2: But that's profound because, that-- what happened there is now resonating--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --really around the country.
Speaker 1: Exactly.
Speaker 2: In, in many ways.
Speaker 1: Well, and, and, the, the, the best part is there are a doctoral students that I knew both, and I was on probably thirty committees at one point when I was Michigan, most of those students are now, not all finished, but those who finished are all tenured and many are full professors.  And so they're now, so the third generation in effect.  If there was that first generation in the '60s [1960s], and then the second generation with the late '70s [1970s], '80s [1980s] into the early '90s [1990s], that third generation asking even different sort of questions.
Speaker 2: But let's talk about also your career in, oh, they're asking a different set of questions, so what--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: So what, what set of questions are they asking?
Speaker 1: Well, I think they're, they're even asking other kinds of questions about how you think about not only the conceptualization of, of race but race as it relates to space and race relates to nation, nation as it relates to empire, empire as it reforms and recasts the ways in which you think about not only the industrial order but capitalism itself.  And so you, you think of the questions I posed in "In Their Own Interests" and I'll take one of my students who, Merida Rua, who's teaching at Williams College [Williamstown, Massachusetts] and she just published a book with Oxford [Oxford University Press], and she is actually looking at Puerto Rican migration into Chicago [Illinois], and but it's, it's a combination of ethnography and history and sociology.  I mean sort of blends three different disciplinary areas and to tell the story of these Puerto Rican migrants, the communities they formed, the boundaries they created, the ways in which they thought of themselves as Puerto Ricans in Chicago but not just as Puerto Ricans, sometimes as black Puerto Ricans, sometimes it's not, how they blended into with the African American community, when they chose not to blend, and how their understanding Chicago, reframed the ways in which they thought about Puerto Rico.  And Puerto Rico as both a separate state and independent of the United States.  And Merida would not have been able to ask the questions she's asked, asking without those early generations putting in place both a foundation of knowledge, in a different way of recasting questions, and so that would be an example.
Speaker 2: So what you're essentially also saying is besides the, the sort of cast away view that--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --African Americans are just okay, just give them their thing--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --to, you know, the work that you and your colleagues did that helped prevent-- open up a different view and a more contextual view, a more completive view of African American--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --studies, to now asking new questions.
Speaker 1: Both new questions and, and old questions anew.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And so if you think oh, you go back to [St. Clair] Drake and [Horace] Cayton and their study of the black metropolis in Chicago, and they knew and they mentioned these Puerto Rican communities and their relationship to the black community.  But the "Black Metropolis" piece then naturally say, well what happens if you work through, the, the door of a Puerto Rican migrant and start looking out into a black metropolis rather than from the other side?  And so whereas Merida's work, you get a walk through a different door.  But, you in some cases you get to walk through two doors, I mean she has this lovely part of, of her book ["A Grounded Identidad"] where she talks about this one funeral home.  It's owned by an African American guy who's married to a Puerto Rican woman and they sit at the intersection of the two communities.  And what happens in those communities, there's Spanish and English, there are African American folk ways, Puerto Rican folk ways actually bump into each other in the context of this funeral home in the communities and then lives that intersect with it.  It's such like, "Oh, okay."  And, and, and for me it's like, I'm glad I'll live long enough to actually see the students that I've worked with at different stages take questions that I got to frame out in one moment and give it life in a completely different way.
Speaker 2: It's wonderful--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --in many ways
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: So--
Story_ID: 106023
Speaker 1: Let's talk about "Love on Trial."
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: Because I felt, I'm telling you, I love that book.
Speaker 2: Oh, thank you.
Speaker 1: For all--so how did that come about?  Because that's atypical of anything else you've done, unless I misunderstand.
Speaker 2: No, so "Love on Trial" started, actually back in 1982 or '83 [1983], I was, when I was cranking through the microfilm for the, the Norfolk [Virginia] book ["In Their Own Interests"], or the dissertation [""At Work and At Home: Blacks in Norfolk, Virginia in 1910-1945"] that became the Norfolk book, I came across this story and I just filed it away.  And I thought hmm, someday I may go back and look it. And so I had been by, by the early 1990s and even with the Norfolk book, I had been intrigued by how identity is formed.  And so I, a lot my work which is a constant, is identity formation and the ways in which people think about themselves and both in history and time and, and in place.  And so I had been teaching courses then on race-making and not just whiteness, but race making and several of my students that I had worked with would go on to write books and pieces that questioning identity.  Merida [Rua]'s book is called "Identidad" ["A Grounded Identidad"] and, "Latinidades," I guess, in the end, is sort of this way of, you know, Latino identity and how it gets formed.  Well, I had another student I was working with, [Thomas] Tom Guglielmo, who would write a book about essentially "White on Arrival: How Italians Became White in Chicago." [sic, "White on Arrival: Italians, Race, Color, and Power in Chicago, 1890-1945"]  And so Tom was part of this cohort.  Heidi Ardizzone was one of my doctorate students in American culture.  I had doctoral students in American culture and doctorate students in history that I, I worked with.  And so Heidi has came to me and asked me would I direct her dissertation?  She wanted to write one on inter-- the notion of interracialness in the first half of the 20th century.  And I said, "Sure."  And I said, "and by the way there's this case I'm been holding, story I've been holding on to for twenty years, Heidi.  You may wanna go look it up.  I mean it's circa 1923, '24 [1924].  It was about this New York socialite and think it was the Rhinelander case but I can't remember more than that."  And so Heidi said, "Okay."  So she went and looked it up and she came back and says "Earl, here's what I found.  I think it's interesting but I don't know if I wanna write my dissertation on it."  I said, "Okay.  But let's look at it for a second."  So we, we talked and I said, "Well, if you don't wanna write your dissertation, do you wanna work with me and see if we craft an article at the very least, because it looks like there's enough here to at least get an article out of it."  And, and she said "Okay."  And so we ended up writing this article that ends up in the International Labor and Working-Class History journal.  And once we got into it, I go "Heidi there's a book here."  It doesn't have to be your dissertation but there's a book here, let's do a book.  And she says, "You sure?"  I said "Yeah," I said I, "I've now been around long enough, I know I can get us a book contract and I says it's one of the part of being older and, and you know enough editors."  So I, I called two editors.  One decides no, they didn't wanna do it, commercial editors, the Free Press.  They said "No," I said "Fine."  I talked briefly to someone at Random House, a guy Peter Demick [ph.] and think that's not right.  Then I called an editor I know at [W.W.] Norton.  I said "Amy, I've talked to a couple other people and I didn't think it was right for them, but I think this book is right for you and that Norton should publish this book."  She said "What are you telling, talking about Earl?"  I said let me send you a prospectus.  So we had produced a prospectus it was bound and all, with a copy of our article and what we were gonna try to do.  And Amy wrote back, now Amy Cherry who was at Norton has a Ph.D. from [University of] Michigan [in Ann Arbor, Michigan] in American Culture.  And, and so I knew that, and I knew that connection.  So she said "I like this."  And she said, "Okay I'll give you, I'll give you a contract."  And so I said to "Heidi, I said (unclear) we got a contract."  And I said, "I'm gone pull rank on you and I'm gone be first author 'cause I got the contract here, but we'll be in every other respects equal and, and we'll say this in everything that comes out."  And so we set about researching and writing and, meanwhile Heidi was also working on her dissertation.
Story_ID: 106024
Speaker 1: And, and it was fun I mean, because we discovered things.  I would do some research, she would do some research, I would write some, she would write some, we would sit in my, our basement at my house at that point and, and then Amy [Cherry] would fly into town and we would exchange chapters and eventually we produced this book, "Love On Trial."  And it's different because I actually wanted this to be different.  I wanted, I chose [W.W.] Norton 'cause I wanted it to reach a popular audience as this commercial book--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --that people would be, find easy to read, not a lot of jargon.  But it has a narrative arc to it that tells an important story.  And, and so we were able to pull it off.
Speaker 2: But it's almost as if you were an English lit major.  I mean--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I mean with that, I mean it's just, it's beautifully written.  It's intriguing and then the whole concept of, you know, race.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I mean that, I think that's probably the--
Speaker 1: Yeah.  It, I love this book because it speaks so much to America in my view.  So we have this young woman who is born of British parents, the mother who argues in court that she's a hundred percent British, a hundred percent Caucasian and a father who says that my mother was a hundred percent British, a hundred percent Caucasian but all I know of my father he was a subject of the British Colonies.  And in there is that one drop rule that gets applied not only in Great Britain but gets applied in the U.S.  And then you fast forward to the Rhinelanders who are one of the oldest and wealthiest families in the U.S. and right up the street here at the Ralph Lauren Building, is the old Rhinelander Mansion [The Gertrude Rhinelander Waldo House in New York City, New York]. And that's where they had resided in, in New York City.  And as we got into this story you realize oh, it's layered with more intrigue and complexity than we even knew.  And that an earlier Rhinelander brother so, Leonard's father, Phillip [Jacob Rhinelander] had a brother who had married a woman of a different class and so that's part of the story and he was Irish and then they were worried about all of this, and then Leonard who clearly loved Alice [Jones] at one level but who also loved his family status and the money and the everything else that went along with it and who has I think we say in the book, was the most inept witness any court had ever seen.  And then Alice's own family is complicated.  Who-- one sister is married to an Italian guy and everyone assumes she's white.  Another sister who's married to a black guy from Virginia and everyone assumes she's black.  And the power patriarchy, because they assumed it from the status of the husband.  And then there's Alice and what is she?  Is she black or white?  And, and so Heidi [Ardizzone] and I were working through, we, the fun part sometimes we'd disagree and so we had to try to figure out how to write our disagreements into the text and as we speculated about things.  And then the day Heidi called me 'cause she had stumbled on the cemetery marker--
Speaker 2: That was fascinating.
Speaker 1: It was.  And-
Speaker 2: Because she left-- her name was "Rhinelander."
Speaker 1: Exactly.  Yeah, I mean she had breached, as we write and, and part of that agreement is so powerful where, when she and Leonard finally split and they have this separation agreement and they, she gets this annuity for the rest of her life until she dies which didn't amount to as much by the time she died in 1989, but she had to forfeit use of the Rhinelander name.  She became Alice Beatrice Jones again.  And then there you go, through.  If you go to the cemetery, which we both have, and there's the headstone for Alice J. Rhinelander.  And you kept thinking, not only did she get the last word but she planned to get the last word.  And there was somewhere along the way someone says, you know, what, you can take me out of certain things up until but in the last end who to, who's gonna dispute it.  And I had thought, okay.
Story_ID: 106025
Speaker 1: This I mean, someday we as, we've [Lewis and Heidi Ardizzone] been approached by a number of people about trying to dramatize this story and, and now two other books that have come out since trying to tell the same--
Speaker 2: The same story?
Speaker 1: (Nodding)
Speaker 2: Oh, I didn't know that.  But I think it would make a wonderful movie honestly, just even looking at the pictures--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --was how-- you know, that was a, 'cause you were trying to look at them, you're reading about them. Then you're looking and--
Speaker 1: Well, I--right after the book first came out, oh, Jesus, I can't believe I just blanked on her name, and you'll know exactly who, [HM] Denise Nicholas called me, Denise called and says "Earl I just read the book.  Would you be willing to allow me to see if I can produce it?"  And she did.  And we had both agreed on what it should look like and all but she could never get the money to produce it.  And so our time elapsed and I've had young people call to say they wanted use it as a play or as some other thing to, it's fine I mean, it for us it was, the joy of writing this book and knowing, and then a lot, a number of people got to read it, at least when it first came out, and, you know, you debate with it and every now and then I will get a note from someone who's read it in their book group or some other and they wanna know an answer or a question and--
Speaker 2: S--
Story_ID: 106026
Speaker 1: So what did, how did you make the decision to tell this story, then contextualize in another chapter, tell the-- you know, 'cause you were, what, what, when did that decision or how was that decision--
Speaker 2: We [Lewis and Heidi Ardizzone] were working and trying to figure out how to actually both get the story out and remain true to our crafts, me in that certain kind of way, and we realized, and we didn't want it to be a classic academic book.  We wanted people to actually imagine they could pick it up and read it.  I mean we had one reviewer says "I just wanted the story, I didn't want all that contextualization."  I said well "That's fine.  I mean its nonfiction isn't it, even though you may think its fiction, its nonfiction."  There-- and we have some scholars saying we want even more contextualization and I said that's fine too.  Someone else will write it and one of, who, this Deborah Gray White's students did one I think for Yale [University in New Haven, Connecticut], that, heavy on the legal in the contextualization, piece.  So we decided probably as we started doing, we divided up the chapters and started doing chapters and then we thought how we rearranged then and cut it up.  And so Heidi and I first pass, Amy [Cherry] jumped in to, and the three of us literally sitting in the basement of my house in Ann Arbor [Michigan] one day and so.
Story_ID: 106027
Speaker 1: So really "In Their Own Interests" and "Love on Trial" they come in, come out like very close to each other.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  So love, "In Their Own Interests" comes out in 1991.
Speaker 1: One.
Speaker 2: So there was a period where I producing a book every other year.  So there was "In Their Own Interests" in 1991, Joe [Joe William Trotter, Jr.] and I did the book on, I think that was '94 [1994] or so [sic, 1996], the "Blacks in the Industrial Age" then, that volume.  Then by '96 [1996], '7 [1997], somewhere in there we have the first of the ten volumes of, of "The Children's Story and African Americans." [sic, "The Young Oxford History of African Americans"]  And then I'm, I almost need, then somewhere in there right after that and you may have the, the timeline--
Speaker 1: Yeah. You are talking about with Robin Kelley?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: That, that's 1994.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So that was--
Speaker 1: The year (unclear) (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: Yeah.  (Unclear) (simultaneous)
Speaker 1: Young Oxford--
Speaker 2: So that was '94 [1994] and then we ended up very soon thereafter.  So I was actually, literally, we were producing something every other year or two.
Speaker 1: And this is huge in academia--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I mean because you're like, you've become this super producer--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --as opposed to people who have trouble getting with their first book.
Speaker 2: I, I had great collaborators.  And it was, there was a part, there was an intellectual energy at Michigan [University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, Michigan] that I was not ever able to replicate at Emory [University in Atlanta, Georgia], that allowed me to be exceptionally productive even with full days, and I was dean-- over that period.  So I was at Michigan fifteen years four, three, almost four of those fifteen years I was directing the Center.  And another seven and a half of those years I was dean of the graduate school.
Speaker 1: And then weren't you (unclear)--
Speaker 2: (Unclear) (simultaneous)
Speaker 1: You were office of the provost too.
Speaker 2: I was vice provost as well.
Speaker 1: Right.  (Unclear)
Speaker 2: Made dean of the graduate school [Rackham Graduate School of the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, Michigan].
Speaker 1: So you can produce and do those things administrative because that's the only thing a lot of times it's perceived either you have one track or the other.  But what about your teach-- are you, you're not, are you--
Speaker 2: I used to teach during that period as well.  I haven't, I mean when I was at Michigan I had a, once I became dean of the graduate school I had I thing where I said I will either teach one year or try to finish a project that year.  And, and I had gotten the, to be honest because once you establish a track record, it's easier to get people to wanna publish your stuff.
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: And to be honest I haven't, I hadn't had a problem finding an outlet for something I really wanted to get out since the early 1990s.  And I, I mean that's not to say my first choice was always where I ended up but I can always find a reputable place and often times not just a reputable, but top reputable place that will wanna publish what I had to write.  And, and I was fortunate.  But, and, and then I had a role that I adopted.  I wanted to make sure I could launch as many of my students as possible, and so I would try to write with at least one of my students every year.  Meaning to get at least one if not two of them something in their early stages a publication so that when they went on the job market they had some kind of a publication.  And--
Speaker 1: Was that something you had learned or is that how you chose to, how to do things because--
Speaker 2: A little bit of both.  Me, I had to, I had realized that if I had a weakness and a handicap when I came out of Michigan, I'm sorry I came--
Speaker 1: (Unclear)
Speaker 2: --out of the University of Minnesota [Minneapolis, Minnesota] is, is that I didn't have as many publications as some folks, and a few of my faculty mentors had chosen to publish with some of my colleagues but not with the rest of us, and, and that was fine.  And I kept saying "If I, once I get to this point I will, won't being able to publish with all of my students but I wanna publish with as many of my students as possible to give them a leg up.  And I know I can get them into places that are visible and, and high quality."  And particularly, when I was doing this every day all the time.  And it was the one, but the second part is just that they kept me moving.  A hunger, there's nothing like a hungry graduate student who wants to get things out because that means they're constantly in your face saying "All right let's go, let's go, let's go.  How do we move this?"  And--
Story_ID: 106028
Speaker 1: So but the, the other thing though is that a lot of times people in academia and especially African Americans--
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: Talk about, you know the, the, the tuggle between administrative work and publishing and so they're not able--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --you know, they say that they can't publish because this, you know, they're, they have to be, serve on this committee and they're asked to serve on this committee and diversity committee and this committee and that committee, no--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I mean I think it's true for some people.  I think it depends on how you work.  And so one of the ways I decided I was gonna do it, is, is that I was gone find partners.  For me to remain active meant that, I mean I started out thinking that I would write every third piece with someone else, then I at some point said "No, it would be every other piece with someone else," and then I said "Well, if I'm gone get this its gone be every piece with someone else."  But it allowed me to remain active and if you choose, mean I say it this to friends all had time, if you choose your partners well, you can productive.  It just means you have to choose your partners well.
Speaker 1: And you're also then, first of all you're at a Tier, Tier one--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --institute.  You know, you're at--
Speaker 2: I'm at a major research institute.
Speaker 1: --major institution [University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, Michigan].  And so there are a lot of resources there.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And, and you're rising up, you, you start even administrative--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --so you're rising up.  What are the other things happening around?  What, what--'cause you take an active role in the Organization [of] American Historians [OAH].
Speaker 2: Yeah.  So I end up, I spend a lot of time, I mean at one point I was active in the Social Science History Association, all way up to the executive committee of the Social Science History Association.  I would back off from that for a while and do, get involved in the OAH.  And I think I said to someone I think I chaired every committee that was possible to chair for the OAH at one point or another over a 20 year period.  I would do some occasional work for the AHA [American Historical Association].  A little less for the Association for the Study of African American Life and History, but I would serve on and be involved in several conferences there.  And then I would just pick and choose.  Of course, I'm I, I was not a big American Studies Association person, although I would go to conferences on occasion.  But, so that's one part on the academic side.  I would spend, and try to increase also then into quasi-governmental service of one form or another.  And that increase once I became dean of the graduate school [Rackham Graduate School of the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, Michigan] because that would put in to conversation with people who wanted to understand more and more about graduate education in the United States.  And so I found myself on committees for the National Academy of Sciences and National Research Council, et cetera.  Doing stuff for NSF [National Science Foundation] in that period.  And then it would go on where it, I would find then once you both agree to do it and go on to do it, you get asked to do more.  So a, a lot of service.  I mean mentioned earlier, for instance, the Center for Research Libraries.  I think I was on that board for six years.  And it was important and a range of other boards and activities.  But, it, it what I discovered in doing so, it sometimes provided me with access to information into individuals I wouldn't have gained otherwise.  And they became critical for my day job.  And so--
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 2: I would know about the next trend or the next developments early enough that I could bring it back and say, you know, "We need to be on the front edge of X."  And that was important so I tried to learn how to keep things in balance.  One of my graduate students, a woman, Jamie Hart once said to me, we were talking about mentoring she said "Earl when I grow up, I don't wanna be you" (laughter).  And I said "Jamie what do you mean?"  She says "Your life's not in balance."  I said "What do you mean my life's not in balance?  My life's in balance."  She says "I don't think it is."  And so we had a conversation.  And what I said to her, I said "You see here me on campus and you see some days I'm doing this 14 to 15 hours a day, you don't know what I've done before I arrived on campus and you don't actually know what I'm doing afterwards.  You don't know how many soccer games I've gone to this week, and that on Saturday I'm gone be in the car driving down to Ohio to watch my daughter play and to do some of the other things.  And it's like and so I, for me it feels like it's in balance.  I see can see it from your vantage point it doesn't," but I said, "you know, we all find our own balance."
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: And it required me over the years during these periods also to recalibrate.
Story_ID: 106029
Speaker 1: I mean one of the things that on the personal side me, I, my first wife and I, Jayne [London] and I had moved, Minnesota to California, California to Michigan and we would end up separating in 1999.  And so one of the things that was lost, was a marriage.  I mean and so it's trying to keep all of these in perspective.  And I mean, I suspect Jayne would say, and she died last summer, but if she were still alive would say that part of that was both of us because I was pulling in one direction and she would, I think the metaphor she would say she was getting lost in the wake and trying to figure out what part of herself was retained as I was creating this, this (unclear) (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: While you were moving up, up, up like this.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And it's literally and just like water there's a wake behind you, and people can drown in the wake.
Speaker 2: And you, you, didn't you have a son though, too?
Speaker 1: Yes, oh, yes.  So we had a son.  So in 1991 my son, Max [Lewis] was born.  And so and Max, who just graduated from Syracuse [University in Syracuse, New York] this last May, is the younger of my two.  My daughter Suzanne [Lewis] is now 27, my son, Max is now 22.  And so I, and he is an Ann Arborite and he was the one born in Ann Arbor [Michigan], Suzanne was born in Oakland [California].  And, and as a result, I said to my daughter when she graduated from high school in Ann Arbor, went off to southern California to USC [University of Southern California in Los Angeles, California] for undergrad before coming to Columbia [University in New York City, New York] for her masters, is my son went from Ann Arbor, to Syracuse and he says I don't mind the snow and its, it's a point of reference for me all along.  And so (unclear) that was a, a real part and, and the hardest part of my life for me there's one chapter, and divorce itself is hard.  I got remarried then in 2002 to my, my current wife, Susan Whitlock.  And then I would leave Michigan [University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, Michigan] in 2004 to go to, to Atlanta [Georgia] to Emory [University], thinking that my son would want to go with me.  And he decided, no, he was gone stay in Ann Arbor with his mom.  And so for the first five years that I lived in Atlanta, I came back to Ann Arbor every other week.  And so my frequent flier miles had a clear line between Atlanta and Detroit [Michigan] as I was trying to maintain a strong fatherly relationship with my son.  And, and we're close.  I mean and I realize though that there were parts of that five years I missed out on, and can't replace and neither of us, or none of us actually realized that Jayne would then end up contracting cancer and dying at age 55.  And so it means, I was saying to someone the other day someone was asking about a memory and I go, you know, the hardest part even when you're separated and divorced from someone, you have shared memories and particularly about the kids and what I didn't remember I could always count on Jayne to remember.  And now I don't remember something and I go to turn and I go, "Oh, shoot."  There's no one else who can remember that in the same way.  And, and so that's (unclear) we divorced but we remained close.  We remained friends throughout and Susan and I were taking care of her in the end.  And so it's that kind of relationship, and I think that was good for the kids, to realize that woe, parents can end one kind of relationship, they can develop another kind of relationship.
Story_ID: 106030
Speaker 1: Okay.  So let's talk about the University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan] and your role in the, the, the case.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: The University of Michigan in the--
Speaker 2: Grutter [Grutter v. Bollinger] and Gratz [Gratz v. Bollinger] cases.
Speaker 1: Right. That's right.
Speaker 2: So--
Speaker 1: And where, 'cause when you get involved with that, you're not there that long, you know, that case lasted how many years?
Speaker 2: Case lasted probably a good five years.
Speaker 1: Five years, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And I wanna understand how, so are you getting involved first from an administrative standpoint and then you bring in the history is that--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  So--
Speaker 1: So just talk about the case (unclear) (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: So Grutter and Gratz cases.  And so it started, a Republican member of the State Legislature in Michigan decided that one of the problems with the University of Michigan is, is that it had an affirmative action practice that discriminated against white kids, basically.  So he put an ad in several of the newspapers in the State of Michigan saying if you're white and believe you were denied admission to the University of Michigan because of your race, send us your name.  And this former state legislator got a name, and then there were three young people whose names appeared, [Patrick] Hammacher, [Jennifer] Gratz, and [Barbara] Grutter.  And there were two at the undergraduate level and one at level of the law school.  By this time Lee Bollinger who had replaced Jim Duderstadt as president of the University of Michigan.  Lee would come back from Dartmouth [College in Hanover, New Hampshire], just before Lee arrived Nancy Cantor had left Princeton [University in Princeton, New Jersey] to become dean of the graduate school [Rackham Graduate School].  As it turns out, there were two final candidates to be dean in the graduate school at that moment.  It was Nancy Cantor and me.  Nancy was selected and I said fine.  This is circa 1996, '7 [1997].  Nancy called me after she was selected, we had never met.  She says, "I'm coming to town, would it be possible to talk?"  And I said, "Sure."  So she came over to my office in, in the Center for Afroamerican and African Studies, I was no longer director, I was sitting in my office, and, and we chatted.  And so finally she looked at me she says, "Earl would you come and work for me as the senior associate dean in the graduate school?"  And I said, "What do you want me to do?"  She says, "It's an open portfolio, you tell me what you want to do and you get to do it."  And I said, "Nancy I have, no one has ever offered me a job with an open portfolio before, I think I may accept your invitation."  And so I ended up doing so.  Nancy then is dean in the graduate school, Lee comes they ask me to be on the search committee for the new provost.  And I was supposed to be on leave, this is one of those leaves I never had.  I'm supposed to be on leave and I said to Nancy I said I'll give you five percent, I'm on leave I'm trying to finish up, I forget which of these projects.  And then tragically a friend, a woman, Betty Jean Jones, African American woman from Albany, Georgia who was a faculty member in theater and a dean, an associate dean in the graduate school, would die in a plane crash.  She was on this commuter flight between Cincinnati [Ohio] and Detroit [Michigan] that went down, a Comair flight.  And so my 95 percent of free time became less than that 'cause I was called in and asked if I would backfield for some things that Betty Jean had been doing.  So I thought okay.  This is the way life goes and, and I'll make it work.  So fast forward, Lee had a search committee after the first, now I'm still married to Jayne [London], after the first meeting I come home I said, "Well Lee doesn't know it yet, but he's about to hire Nancy."  And she said "How do you know?"  I said "He just told me so, he just doesn't know he told me."  He did.  And it was, I knew enough about Lee and I know enough about Lee and his attraction to certain elite networks and, and [William] Bill Bowen who's across the, the way and, and all that Lee was signaling he was interested in Nancy without telling anyone else.  And so Nancy was hired to be provost and then I ended up interim dean of the, I went from being the senior associate dean to interim dean in the graduate school, to then dean of the graduate school. And my only obstacle was actually Lee, because Nancy would have made me dean right away, Lee wanted a process.  And so we went for another six, seven months before I was named dean of graduate school.
Story_ID: 106031
Speaker 1: After that, we were in the Grutter and Gratz case [Grutter v. Bollinger and Gratz v. Bollinger], three litigants [Patrick Hammacher, Jennifer Gratz, and Barbara Grutter] in all.  And so Lee [Bollinger] and Nancy [Cantor] came and asked said, "Look we want you to do something for the university which is to head a internal effort to think about diversity at the University of Michigan and it's for the university communities and you will have both our blessing and our support and you can do it whatever way you want."  I said "Okay."  So I put together a student committee and we began to put together a series of programs and activities to talk about the role and value of diversity in the university community.  And I said, I think it's gone important to show that diversity is not just about race and gender, and that diversity is about a number of things.  So we in the context of the Grutter and Gratz case what was going on, was the University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan] then having a broader examination about the place of diversity, and spun out of it actually was two very, very important activities that still last to this day, in addition to what happened out of the case itself.  One was, is that we decided to take on the whole issue of mental health and stigma as a diversity issue inside of the university.  A woman, Pat McCune, who used to work for me at the graduate school [Rackham Graduate School], became the producer of this film on mental health and particularly depression among college age students.  And we aired a, a documentary based on conversations in, with students of, at Michigan in all.  Did it in one afternoon downtown Ann Arbor, 500 people showed up.  And we, we, realized we'd hit a nerve.  Then working with the former chair, he was then chair of the Psychiatry Department a guy named John Greden, and John says, "Earl I have a idea setting up the first national center for the study of depression in the country."  And I said well, "Johnny we've just done this so why don't we pair, come together."  And out of this effort from Grutter and Gratz we actually produced the first now annual conference on depression among college age students that's held every year in Michigan of bringing together speakers and all.  John went on to create this center [University of Michigan Depression Center], I'm on the board of this center and, and now there's a national network of depression centers.  Most people don't know that that activity in some ways sprung from Grutter and Gratz.  It was the Grutter and Gratz coming together with people talking about the broader issue of diversity.  We did a similar thing, program on disability.  We did a range of other kinds of questions there.  At the same time, we're talking about race and difference and, and gender and difference and how those pieces needed to be integrated.  So my job was then to not only talk about the history of diversity but to program activities that force people to deal with the divergent views and to think about diversity both in its narrow sense and in this broad sense.  And it was fun.  It was, five, six years I, I ran it until me, I left Michigan.  And in fact, I had my own little operation, had one dedicated person and, and we had activities.  Now my successor was less interested in it, so it disappeared.
Story_ID: 106032
Speaker 1: Well you know what the, what is the book and the book that was developed and--
Speaker 2: (unclear) "Defending Diversity."
Speaker 1: "Defending Diversity."  Which, you know, it's even just in the, in the foreword and introduction where you see, you know, that this has been talked about for years coming out of University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan], and I would say also across institutional collabor--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --collaboration.  You know, because a lot of the universities working--
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: --and making it happen.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Well, the one piece, I mean one, there's a project, [Patricia] Pat Gurin who is one of the coauthors of that book was chair of psychiatry, psychology rather, and what Pat noted in even today's research in, in intergroup relations, there's demonstrable evidence, social scientific evidence that kids who actually not only go to school with diverse populations but are enrolled in programs that actually examine that diversity tend now to, tend to participate in the civic culture more robustly than their classmates.
Speaker 1: Hmm.
Speaker 2: And we've been able to demonstrate this now across fifteen or so campuses around the country.  I mean (unclear) and even the critics on the right, who keep saying "this is nonsense," can't dispute the findings.  They've, they've tried but and so.
Speaker 1: But without that, I mean for any kind of affirmative action, it was dead.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I mean it was going out backwards.
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: But what the Michigan case [Grutter v. Bollinger and Gratz v. Bollinger], and this is, in going back to history, I would argue that the Michigan case did something that we haven't seen since Brown [Brown v. Board of Education] on which is to mobilize the academic community to work in a cross-disciplinary way to show the place of race in American life and society.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: And so psychologist, historians, sociologists, political scientists, demographers, they were all there, they were all called on, and it's not unlike Kenneth and Mamie Clark's doll test and the work that [HM] John Hope Franklin did for Thurgood Marshall.
Story_ID: 106033
Speaker 1: So, why do you end up leaving?  Now, so Michigan [University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, Michigan], is it one president or how, how many presidents are there when you're, 'cause remember you said I had access to the--
Speaker 2: So when I arrived at Michigan the president was Jim Duderstadt.  Jim would be forced to step aside for various reasons.  For a moment there's an acting president, Homer Neal, African American physicist.
Speaker 1: Which was, oh we've interviewed him.  But that--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --that's huge that he--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --had the--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, so, yeah.  So, Homer, Homer was there and he was acting.  Then Lee comes in to be the new president of the university.  Lee leaves after getting offered to go to Columbia [University in New York City, New York] and a little--
Speaker 1: Get Lee's last name?
Speaker 2: Lee Bollinger.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I'm sorry.  Lee Bollinger leaves and, and Lee leaves and comes to Columbia.  And he was in the context where he was, he came in second to [Lawrence] Larry Summers at Harvard [University in Cambridge, Michigan] and was, which was publicized.  He was at Columbia and, I'm sorry, he was at Michigan.  The Michigan Board was messing around with the salary they should pay him, Columbia came and--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and he left.  Then there for a moment, there was an interim president, I know, another interim president at Michigan a guy named Joe White [B. Joseph White], Joe, B. Joe who--
Speaker 1: Joe B.--?
Speaker 2: --who was in Illinois [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign] for a period.  Joe was the interim president at, at Michigan.  He had stepped down as dean of the business school and he was interim president at Michigan.  The regents then asked me to chair the search committee for the permanent president.  So this was 2001.  I am called on, this is after 9/11 [September 11, 2001].  Lee's in the process of moving, Joe's the interim president and I'm chairing the search committee.  And so I then, that's why all of these I, I chair the search committee that would advise the board on the slate of candidates.  In the end they would choose Mary Sue Coleman who had been president of the University of Iowa [Iowa City, Iowa].  And so Mary Sue has been the president for the last twelve years.
Speaker 1: So after some turbulence and in and out it, it settled down.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  So it settled down.  So Mary Sue is due to retire as president this coming June but she had a twelve year run.
Speaker 1: 'Cause that's long for a college president, right?
Speaker 2: Very long for her, yeah.  And she had been president of Iowa for six or seven years.  So she's had a pretty long stint.
Story_ID: 106034
Speaker 1: So what made you decide to go to Emory [University in Atlanta, Georgia] then?  What was that, that decision?
Speaker 2: It was probably driven by three factors.  One, several people had come to me several times and said "Earl are you gonna be the next provost of the University of Michigan?"  And I said, "I don't know."  And my friend and colleague, Paul Courant, had been the acting provost when Joe [B. Joseph White] was the acting president.  When Mary Sue [Coleman] came in, there were some who believed then there was gone be a search process for the next president, I mean provost.  And Mary Sue decided that she was comfortable with Paul staying in that role.  So she lifted the title of "acting" and made him provost.  I said "Okay.  So my, not gonna happen here at this moment."  I get a call from Spencer Stuart's search consulting firm and the search consultant called me and says, "Earl last time we talked was about five years ago, and you said to me call you back in five years when your daughter is about to graduate from high school.  By my records your daughter is about to graduate from high school.  Would you be interested in thinking about being the provost at Emory?"  And I said to her, "Paula (ph.) that is really good.  I have dealt with a lot of search consultants but I've never known anyone to maintain a five year tickler file."  I said, "You got, at least you got my interest here."  And she said, "Well things have changed at Emory."  And I said (unclear) 'cause I, I knew a little bit about Emory.  And I go, I'm not sure to what the new president and at least consider it.  And then several other peoples said to me, "Just think about it Earl."  So I went and had a conversation in, with the folks at Emory.  I met [James] Jim Wagner, who years older than I am and had grown up in the other place.  If I had been a Virginia boy, he's a Maryland boy.  And so, and we hit it off.  And I thought "Okay.  I, maybe I could be provost."  So I went back to Michigan and I explained to them, to Mary Sue here's my, here's what I'm thinking.  They offered me two more jobs (laughter).  They were making me vice president of research and the head of international if I stayed.  And I started to laugh.  I had, and by that time I had remarried and, Susan [Witlock] and I were married, and I said and, and Susan had lived in Ann Arbor longer than I had and, and, I said "Well I can stay at Michigan and have three jobs and get paid for one, or I can go to Emory and be a provost and have the title that goes with those, in some ways, the elements of those three jobs."  And so, and I went back to Mary Sue and just asked a question, a little bit about her view of the tenure of the provost and when that may open up again and whether or not I, help me think about whether or not I'd be better off biding my time at Michigan or going and being a provost in the next few months.  And I didn't get the answer I wanted.  And, and, and so I left.  Now irony of ironies, right, I get to Emory, I'm there a year and I get a call back because Paul's stepping down as provost and, and would I come back and I go, "No."  It was a missed moment.  I several, board members had thought I was gone be the next provost and several, much of the campus had thought I would have been, it didn't happen, that door is closed.  I had made at least a five year commitment to Emory, and I try not to renege on those kind of pledges and promises.
Speaker 1: And so you this, you're coming in as provost is historic--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --for Emory.
Speaker 2: It's historic for Emory--
Speaker 1: --because there's no African American provost--
Speaker 2: I was the highest ranked African American in Emory's history, ever period.  I mean, and to be honest if you look across the South there probably have only been two African Americans that have been into the level of provost or above, or certainly the level of provost at one of the major southern universities.  The other person was Bernadette Gray-Little at Chapel Hill [University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill].  And Bernadette and I were provost about the same time.  And, but if you go through the history and, I mean, and truth, I mean sad truth is that right now and among the AAU [Association of American Universities] institutions, the leading research universities in the United States, there are no African American provosts.  I mean in sixty-something institutions, there's one fellow who was African-born who I think has become a naturalized citizen who is provost at [University of Illinois] Urbana-Champaign [HM Ilesanmi Adesida], but when I stepped out of this role there is no one.  So it's even more than Emory its, there's initial in my view, where the larger complex of American, higher education in particular at the major research universities.
Story_ID: 106035
Speaker 1: So before we talk about that, let's talk about your experience there, I mean because you're from the South but you haven't had any tenure I mean any, any--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --experience in teaching or being part of the academy of the southern institution (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: Absolutely.  Now, and Atlanta [Georgia] itself is fascinating, Emory [University] in Atlanta, it's even more fascinating.  And so I would say three things.  One, I had to remind people from the very first day in that I was not a miracle worker.  And so I used to give these lectures to people, "My name is not Moses, it's not in my first name or my middle name or my last name.  I can part no seas or help create any miracles.  The hard work of dealing with change in the institution has to come from the ground up, in that we all have to put our shoulder to it and work together if we wanna make change."  Some people heard that, some people wanted me to wave a magic wand and to undo years.  And so when I left Michigan [University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, Michigan], Robin [Kelley] and Elsa [Barkley Brown] came back to be part of the ceremony to celebrate my tenure at Michigan and going off to Emory.  And Robin got up and said something to the effect, "Well Earl, you're heading off now to the plantations and you're in the big house."  And I was like "Robin that's not funny" (laughter), and, and that's not funny.  But there was this way in which going to it was this notion I was on the fourth floor and I was now in the big house.  And, and, and I was not just the head Negro in charge I was the, the second man in charge.  And so it was that complex piece. Atlanta itself, Emory too I think, Atlanta itself still thinks in black and white terms and ways that I kept trying to caution people that the future of Atlanta is not framed by Auburn Avenue and Peachtree.
Speaker 1: That's true.
Speaker 2: And that metaphorically speaking, the future of Atlanta is gonna be defined by Buford Highway, which is this international highway arrayed with restaurants and businesses from Latin America, Asia and the rest in Africa, and the rest of the world.  And that it's that triangulation that will be the future between Auburn and Peachtree and Buford and that Emory needed to situate itself in that triangle and not between the axis between Auburn and Peachtree.  And so we set about trying to figure out a way to do so, and so with mixed results I think.  But Jim and I had a joke, [James] Jim Wagner and I had a joke, and that it was more than a joke.  I said, "Jim, I'll do any, almost anything you ask me to do as provost except for one thing."  He said "What's that?"  "I am not going hunting on the weekend with these guys drinking bourbon."  I said, you know, "I'm not worried about Dick Cheney and having a Dick Cheney moment, I'm worried about people getting too comfortable after two or three, three bourbons, and will say things, that because they're now comfortable that will injury me but injury them as well."
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And so he went, I never went and, and on a couple occasions we would get together on Monday.  I said, "How was it?"  He says, "I'm so glad you weren't there" (laughter).  And I said "No need to say anything more.  I, I, I know some of characters," and these were the leading figures of the city, right.  Almost all white guys, who all of a certain age, who saw the world in a certain way.
Speaker 1: You know the interesting thing to, it would have been different to be provost at Michigan because--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --look you, you, you came up through the ranks there--
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: --it's different coming side-- laterally.
Speaker 2: Well, and some people thought I had been, there were some white folks in the Atlanta community close to the university who thought I had been brought in to deal with a racial incident on campus.  And I would say to these, I, I, would say, and it may have sounded arrogant but I wanted to be arrogant at this point, I said, "No, to be honest I'm more qualified than anybody else who was in the pool.  I can stack my credentials up against everybody else who was in that pool because it was public, and I've had more experience at well-known institutions.  The only difference they were public rather than private but, I served on national committees they've never served on et cetera, et cetera."  So in, in making just a decision about who's the best, I was the best, period.  Now we can always get into a conversation about fit, it's that ambiguous category and that allows people to not always choose the best.  And, and so, but in the end I thought I was reasonably well respected by most, even loved by a few.  And the others came to more than tolerate the fact that I was different and I would ask different questions.
Story_ID: 106036
Speaker 1: So what are the things you are proud of that you've accomplished and what was frustrating about the experience?
Speaker 2: I, I loved the fact that I got to actually try to do some things that may not change the institution [Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia] forever but made a difference for a time.  So to give you an example, I used to pickup basketball and I played picks for basketball with a lot of the guys who worked in facilities, in facility management.  And they didn't even know who I was at first until I show up and then they came to realize "Oh, you're that guy.  All right."  But we became friends and they would tell me things.  And I realized that one of the big issues on campus was the relationship between class and labor on campus.  So I actually commissioned the first two year study of class and labor on a university campus in the South that began to look at pieces.  Now will it all be implemented?  Probably not.  But there's a document there that's part of a public record.  Where we spent two years trying to understand the relationship between class and labor.  You know, 'cause a lot of black men and women, particularly black guys in one set of jobs, there are a number of black women in another set of jobs on campus.  And you can see the flooring and you can see the ceiling.  My commitment on the way out to the community, forcing everybody else to agree to it, that this would be the first of three studies that they are gonna have to complete over the next six year period, seven year period, and got my colleagues to commit to do it even after I left. [] And so I--
Speaker 1: So what is--how many African American faculty are at Emory it's--
Speaker 2: Let's see the student body is ten percent, so it's the highest among the many of the elite privates in the country.  The faculty is, it's hard to, any percent in and of itself hides a lot.  So let me-- what I mean.  For 3---- of the almost 4,000 faculty, 3,000 are in the medical school.  And the, the vast majority of the medical school faculty are clinical track faculty, not tenured track faculty.  And so all of those tenured track faculty, and there are several hundred African American tenured, clinical track faculty in the medical school but they're not tenured track.  You get over to the school of business, out of 50 faculty there's only 1 African American tenured track and 2 African American, essentially clinical track, faculty in the business school.  You go to the law school, I mean, this is why I can do it, it's just when, when I answer your question it's like I give you a number its probably about 6 or 7 percent overall but that hides a lot of the variation, I mean it's probably 14 percent in theology but only 3 percent in business.  In law it's a slightly better but not hugely better.  So it's better in public health than it is in, in at our Oxford campus [Oxford College in Oxford, Georgia] which is our two year campus when I was there.  So it, it goes from 2 to 7 percent.
Story_ID: 106037
Speaker 1: So what made you leave there [Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia]?
Speaker 2: Umm.
Speaker 1: And how--go--I wanna get my, my facts right.  When did you join the board?
Speaker 2: I joined the board--
Speaker 1: The Mellon [Andrew W. Mellon Foundation] Board.
Speaker 2: The Mellon Board
Speaker 1: 2011?
Speaker 2: (Unclear) about 2010 or so.
Speaker 1: I have it at 2011.  So you were on the board two years--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --before.
Speaker 2: (Unclear)
Speaker 1: Okay.  So how did the invitation come?
Speaker 2: So the invitation, so, I left, let me answer the first and then I'll answer the second.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So the, I had come to the conclusion probably about three years ago that I had come close to learning almost everything I could learn as a provost at Emory.  And so I said to Jim [Wagner], when Jim first hired me, he says "Earl would you come and stay for three years."  I said, "Jim you don't want me for three years, you want me for five years.  I will guarantee you I will be here for five years as your provost."  So I turned down jobs and job opportunities in that five year period.  Then when I started to look, I came in second at three or so places for various reasons.
Speaker 1: And were you wanting at that point for other positions, was it provost--
Speaker 2: Pre-- (simultaneous)
Speaker 1: --or were you on the president track?
Speaker 2: I was, I was on about to become a president--
Speaker 1: President.
Speaker 2: --someplace else--
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 2: --of a university.  And so, and so I kept thinking okay I'll stay.  But it was clear that at some point in this period I was gonna leave and so I had made a commitment to Jim that in, and I, I had no desire to be provost more than ten years because at that point I needed to do something else for myself and so I was gonna time myself out, if not anyone's gonna ask me to leave and I was gonna time myself out after, ten yours.  In fact, there were people who loved for me to stay and my guess is I, I have some friends in Emory who now see turmoil and wish I had stayed.  But it's all about change and the next person coming and changing things.
Story_ID: 106038
Speaker 1: So here I was on the board, we were engaged in a search process Don, Don Randel who was president of the Mellon Foundation had been at Chicago [University of Chicago in Illinois].  Don had reached a magical number.  All our executive officers have to retire at the age of seventy-two.  And Don was timing out in effect.  And so we had a search underway and I, it was a committee of the whole, the whole board was the search committee.  I had been actively participating and I'd been asked early on was I interested and I said "No."  And I was actively participating in the search process.  One meeting, I had to go to Brazil for Emory related, I was taking a group to Brazil to, to work on some relationships in Brazil.  So I missed the whole set of conversations here at the Foundation.  I flew back from Brazil on a Wednesday.  I was home that night, and I flew to New York [New York City, New York] that Thursday for board meetings here on Thursday.  Sitting in the room around the corner with one of my colleagues, Colin Lucas who was the former vice chancellor of, of Oxford University and who had been to Chicago at the University of Chicago as well, was one of the deans at Chicago at one point in his life.  So Colin and I were talking and he, we get up to go to what we think is a committee meeting and when I walk into this room, I thought it was odd for the committee to be meeting in this room, but I walked into this room, the whole board is there and my colleagues asked would I leave the room.  I go, "Okay."  I had no idea what was going on.
Speaker 2: You mean this is--you're already on the board--
Speaker 1: I'm already on the board.
Speaker 2: You're on the board, but how did you get to the board (unclear) (simultaneous)
Speaker 1: Oh, so I got to the board.  Okay.  Then--
Speaker 2: You, 'cause you (unclear) (simultaneous)
Speaker 1: Yeah.  No let me (unclear).  I got to the board I, it almost similar circumstances.  Don [Randel]called me out of the blue one day and he goes "Earl would you be willing to come and talk to our board about what you say are the major cutting issues in higher education?  And you sit in all of these places and it would be useful for them to hear what you have to say."  I said, "Sure."  So, and I said to Don, I said, "Don I'm traveling internationally I'm coming back from China, if they can deal with a guy who's going to be a little jet lagged 'cause I'll, I'll come home, I'll change clothes, I'll spend a night and then I'll fly to New York," which is what I did.  And I came and sat in this room sitting at that head of that table and tried to answer the two or three questions, and then the whole range of questions that came from the members of the, the board.  I didn't realize it was a dress rehearsal, so it was essentially an interview.   And that Monday I got a call from Don saying "My colleagues on the board were so taken, they wonder if you would ever consider joining the board as a trustee," and I go "Okay."  And by that time I figured maybe something was up.  And I said, and so I got my head around it.  And I was on the board of a group that this foundation had created Emeriti [Retirement Health Solutions], which I point because it often used to meet in the building across, on the courtyard here.  So I said "Sure." So at that point there were three African Americans on the board 'cause Walter was still on the board.
Speaker 2: [HM] Walter [E.] Massey.
Speaker 1: Massey was on the board.  And Danielle Allen was on the board.
Speaker 2: She had joined Walt, 'cause Walter had been on the board as a singular (unclear) (simultaneous)
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Walter been the singular, Danielle had joined.  And Danielle who had been in Chicago [University of Chicago in Illinois] and then is at the Institute for Advanced Studies at Princeton [University in Princeton, New Jersey] and won the MacArthur [Fellowship] in between.  So Danielle was the second one, and then I was gonna be the third one (unclear) (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: That was, that's historic in and of itself.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it is, it is.  Now Walter would be retiring within a year and so the numbers would go from three to two real quickly.  But, but anyway there was that moment.  So I, I got this invitation.
Speaker 2: And the board's not that large is it?
Speaker 1: Nine people.  I mean we can go up to 10, at max 11, but we try to keep it around nine.  And so I got a call, and, to give a talk and that talk led to essentially an interview that led to my appointment on the board.
Story_ID: 106039
Speaker 1: And in very similar circumstances than the presidency.  Literally, I'm asked to leave the room and what had happened while I was out of the country at that point, my colleagues had decided that while the pool was okay that I may, they thought I may be better than anyone else in the pool that they had seen and to see if they could persuade me to step in as the president of the Foundation.  At that moment I was deep in conversation of about becoming the president of a public university.  And so I had to decide pretty quickly whether or not 'cause I was still, have gone to the last stage of conversations with a board about becoming president of a public university.  And so I, my wife [Susan Whitlock] and I sat down, she was in New York with me and I said well look this what, this is what just happened 'cause we were on one path only to be now sent to another path.  And said "So it's either this university or the Mellon Foundation."  The Mellon Foundation is definite, the university is highly probable, 'cause I called the chair of the search committee and I said "Look here's what's been presented itself to me.  Am I one of three or am I your, your number one?"  And the person would say, "In all honesty, he says I can't tell you definitely it's yours but there's you and there's a line and there are the other people."  And I said, okay.  And so I had a choice to make.  And I called a good friend of mine who, it's a childhood friend she's a, we grew up together in Virginia we were like high school, early high school girlfriend.  So I said, Coretha [Rushing] here are my choices, and she's the chief administrator officer at Equifax and, and so highly placed in the business world.  And she laughed, she said, "Earl is there really a decision?"  I said, "What do you mean?"  She says, "Let me get this right, you're begging for the money or you're giving it away.  You're begging for money or giving it away.  You can't figure out which one you wanna do?" (laughter)  I said, "Okay I got it."  And, and so I called a few other people who were close friends and just to sort them out, and, and we decided okay.  The Mellon Foundation made a whole lot more sense.  The things that interested me and that I considered important, I could probably have a greater effect in shaping and shifting from this vantage point than I could from any place else.

Speaker 1: Be you elite institution or marginal institution, those that were endowment dependent found themselves often times with illiquid assets that they couldn't liquidate fast enough to deal with payroll and so they had to take out even more debt to meet their actual needs, this is Harvard's [Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts] story.  At, at Emory [University in Atlanta, Georgia] we knew we were gonna have to take millions of dollars out of the budget on pretty short order.  Our students were even needier than before, so we were gonna have to spend much more money on financial aid.  And so as someone crassly put it at a meeting I was attending last week, "You know you're in trouble when you have a product that most people can't afford."  And I thought it's a little more complicated than that but I understood as a business person.  So it, so it really heady time for American higher education.  And while I was prepared take on the job of a presidency of a university and, and, for a long I actually thought to be honest I was gonna go back and be president of University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan].  It was a long time that I held on to that fantasy and it was fueled by a, a few people in Michigan.  And as fate would have it that job comes open after I had stepped into this job (laughter).
Speaker 2: There is still a chance.
Speaker 1: Yeah. So, and you would be. So--
Story_ID: 106041
Speaker 1: So the decision to come here [the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation] was based not, what on, and you're talking about what are the possibilities, so, and you've alluded to some of your visions--
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: --but what would be success for you?
Speaker 2: Success for me is to get my colleagues here in the Foundation to reimagine what it is we want to try to achieve over this next 10 to 15 year period, so reconceptualizing.  And that's what we're engaging in as a new strategic planning exercise where yesterday I was talking to one group I says "Look I talked to the board a few weeks ago, we've laid out some ideas and they said this is great, we even encourage you to be bolder."  And I said, so I turned to the team I says "So I'm gonna give you a freedom of a complete white board.  Tell me how you would redesign your area if it was a complete white board."  And so we're engaging in this sort of white board strategy session internally to reimagine.  And there are some interesting things that we're gonna do.  And so we're committed, for instance, on a diversity front.  We have a diversity program.  We're committed on the diversity front to not only having a range of discreet programs but what if, if the Mellon Foundation did something it has never really done and put its name out front and create an annual report on the value of diversity in American life entitled "Our Compelling Interests" and what we would do in that annual report is highlight the best research in, in a particular domain.  And so we have begun the job, I got, in fact, I've arranged I'm gonna get the contract finalized, with Nancy Cantor to be the point person for me, to begin to think through and I, she and I working together.  This field of 10, 15 research questions when we will produce, because I said to a group the other day, I said look, I could worry every fall about the next case the Supreme Court is gonna take on in the area of affirmative action, and I can lose a whole lot of sleep.  But I learned something on a trip to Israel and in the West Bank some years ago, and the phrase there is called "facts on the ground".  And you, and then in American Jewish prudence you wanna establish as many facts on the ground.  And so I said "I want the research that we've produced to show up as footnotes in Supreme Court decisions, because those footnotes become the ways in which we begin to shape or constitutional law in history and American life."  And so my goal is so I actually produce a body of work that other people have to pay attention to.  And it has to find its way into Supreme Court decisions.  And it has to find its way into the ways in which the justices think about the world.  That would be success.  If I can influence, and that requires us to take the long view.  I say so, when I'm arguing it is not a strategy that won't have dividends tomorrow or in 5 years, but in 30 years.  And so the great thing about a perpetuity or a legacy foundation, is we will be around for a while.  I mean we're not [Bill and Melinda] Gates [Foundation].  We have no "sunset clauses."  I mean Gates will disappear twenty years after Bill and Melinda die.  We won't.  And we will still be here and so we can take the long view.  And we need to come up with a strategy, some areas for the long view.  So that's one area.  The other area, say, look in the performing arts area, I mean my great concern is, is how we sustain the performing arts organizations.  And so the team is trying to figure out a whole set of new kinds of grants that allow for performing arts organizations to grow and develop over time with different kinds of infusions of cash.  But my also is, my concern is for the artists.  And so I'm asking our team to see can we come up with an insurance, an insurance plan?  Can we actually use the Affordable Healthcare Act [Affordable Care Act] to put enough monies into some kind of insurance vehicle that artists can actually get low-cost, high quality insurance?  So, if we put 5 to 10 million dollars into some kind of vehicle or device that then with an insurance courier that they get to make money from a continuative fund, and you got a large enough pool to minimize against adverse conditions, can we do that in such a way that any artists who belongs to these 15 or 20 organizations can then get health care for 50, 60 a hundred dollars a month?  Is that possible?  And if we can do both of those things, then we really are democratizing the creativity because we're allowing people to actually imagine they can be artists and not thinking I have to work four or five jobs just make ends meet, and I can devote myself to my craft and, and, and what I'm interested in.  So that's sort of a, a range of the kinds of things and questions that we're posing.  And I thought why do, why do this job?  'Cause I can sit here and working with other people and have fun designing and knowing that if we do it, people will pay attention, yeah.
Story_ID: 106042
Speaker 1: So I wanna ask, we-- some philosophical questions and, you know, we've done some of that but I wanna look at your-- you still consider yourself a social historian--
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: --right?  Urban social historian?
Speaker 2: I, I have looked at the beauty of my life as I have, I have, I can sometimes be urban, I can sometimes be just social, like one point was a labor historian, and I have written little pieces on the history of education at times.  And so I, social historian is broad enough to encompass almost anything I wanna be at any given time, so.
Speaker 1: Well, let's talk about where African American studies is, as you see it, and where do you see it going--
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: --and what role have you played and would you like to play?
Speaker 2: Sure.  African American studies, and I think as a field, as it continues to grow and mature as this, we've had more people enter it.  And I think one of the great advantages since I actually started, though we're, in 1984 when I joined Berkeley [University of California, Berkeley in Berkeley, California] there were no Ph.D. programs in African American studies, if you think of it.  Mean and then there were, Berkeley had a Ph.D. study program in ethnic studies but over that period we've grown where you can either get a joint degree as you can get at Yale [University in New Haven, Connecticut] or you can get your own individual degree that you can get at Berkeley.  You see other places they have started to say it's not just about teaching undergraduates, it's also about the production of new knowledge inter-generationally, and how one imagines producing this new knowledge inter-generationally.  And, and that's important because if, if you think there are, I would say three to four classic models out there.  You have the Harvard [University in Cambridge, Massachusetts] model which is exceptional individuals doing their own work.  And so Skip [HM Henry Louis Gates, Jr.] and Bill Wilson [William Julius Wilson] and Cornell [West] and Anthony [Appiah] and when they were all there, Evelyn [HM Evelynn M. Hammonds or HM Evelyn Brooks Higginbotham], etc.  But then you ask the question, "Who are their students?"  And what students have they produced in this last period that are Harvard students that come out of the Harvard African American studies program?  And that has not been the main thrust or the focus.  And so, so that model works but it works in a particular kind of way.  You go to then the, I'll use Berkeley then on the other end with a Ph.D. program.  And what Berkeley has and will continually need to do, is to be able to identify its students as the next leaders of African American studies if they're actually gonna be a Ph.D. program.  It's not just enough to have the Ph.D. program and produce students but the students need to be leaders then of the next generation of African American studies.  And in, and in there's the Temple [University in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] Program which has a particular focus for a long time, there's some efforts at UMass Amherst [University of Massachusetts in Amherst, Massachusetts], and, and then Yale [University in New Haven, Connecticut] had the joint program, et cetera, et cetera.  Then and what you find in most places, is actually the hybrid model of individuals interested in African American studies who are still trained in a disciplinary sense.  And so they're historians with an interest in African American studies, may get a job in African American studies coming out, but they were trained initially as historians or literary scholars or psychologist or, or what have you.  And for much of the history of African American studies, it is that group of individuals who have become the intellectual leaders.  And if you go and look, most of us who taught in the first programs or, or even the second, were all trained as disciplinarians.  And--
Speaker 1: You mean interdisciplinary?
Speaker 2: No, we were trained--
Speaker 1: (Unclear) (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: --as disciplinarians.  I was trained as a historian before I actually came to understand African American studies.  It's actually when I moved to Berkeley and in the African American studies department teaching in the ethnic studies Ph.D. program, that my ethnic studies Ph.D. students who were coming from a whole range of different fields forced me to think not just as a historian but I had to think about "Okay what was literature asking?  And how does sociology read this and how the--", and so and in, in a way it's that juxtaposition of the interdisciplinary graduate program and the disciplinary field that forced me to think of myself as an African Americanist. More, broadly I, I (unclear) left Minnesota even though I was taught in African American studies in Minnesota, I was teaching the history courses in African American studies in Minnesota--
Story_ID: 106043
Speaker 1: So that's where I think it's different, is that now we're on the cusp of a generation of young people who are trained in a multidisciplinary way to ask questions that blur the lines between history, sociology, anthropology, et cetera.  And the real question becomes: "Who will be the leaders of the instantiation of that particular approach to African American studies."  And, and that's an open question.  And I, I don't, I don't pretend to know the answer to that question.  I've, I've seen some students in some cases that come out of American culture or American studies and with an interest in African American studies and have that multidisciplinary sort of frame and lens through which they analyze their work. Mean the last thing I would say here is that, is that I think about the future, it's also then what, well, what ways will students want to mark this next generation of work?  So let me give an example.  When I was at Michigan [University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, Michigan] I decided that it was not just enough for me to graduate my own students and send them out into the field.  If I really was gonna have an impact on the field, I needed to start a book series, University of California [Press].  So I actually was sitting there one day I said, I need a book series.  I walked across campus and called my friend George Sanchez, George was still at Michigan.  I said, "George, let's start a book series."  He said, "What do you have in mind, Earl?"  And I said, "Here's what I have in mind, but it's not complete.  What do you have in mind and who else should join us?"  So the American Crossroads book series started because I had a conversation with George, and we both came to, truly understand our ability to actually shape the field, is not defined solely by the students we work with.  It's by actually giving them a platform to produce new work that then filters through the academy and forces people to rethink.  And so we called it American Crossroads for particular kinds of reasons and, and we asked George Lipsitz and Peggy Pascoe when she was still alive, and Dana Takagi to join us in this effort, and we did.  And it was 40 books in, close to 40 books in, if not 40, and at least half of them have won book awards.  And but, but it's that way, and, and so I hope and this is, this is what I don't know.  But I hope my students imagine themselves being entrepreneurial for the academy and the discipline in a way in that friends and I were in another stage.  I mean I wasn't even a full professor when I went to say, "We need a book series."  And or I had just become a full professor.  And but I knew I had enough credibility that I could convince editors to take this on.  And, and I was (laughter)I  had learned enough about selling and marketing at that point in time to say , I mean it is a sales job and you have to explain to people why this is gonna be better than anything else they can invest in.
Speaker 2: How do you--that, that's, that's interesting.  I like--there's a lot of people in the academy, you know, if you're young you want to be accepted as a scholar--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --so you're not thinking necessarily about entrepreneurism in that way.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Story_ID: 106044
Speaker 1: Now, the thing, when I also read your first book ["In Their Own Interests"], I was thinking that it made a difference that you were African American and it made a difference that you were from that area.  But I'm, is that true or not?
Speaker 2: It probably because--
Speaker 1: (Unclear) (simultaneous) felt that way?
Speaker 2: I don't know if you should have.  I mean I think it certainly made a difference that I was African American 'cause I thought I was asking a slightly different set of questions.  I remember Robin Kelley and I used to laugh about this 'cause we both cringe at certain book prizes and we said, well, we don't want a book prize that says it's about race relations.  While we're writing about racial relations, that's not the lens through which we actually are trying to tell a story.  I mean, for me I was trying to say that African American people actually did live their lives day to day and sometimes they thought about it in the context of a larger white world.  There are many days when it was not the ways in which they framed themselves to walk out the door and encounter the world.  So that experience I think was important.  In my view Norfolk [Virginia] while okay, was sort of incidental.  I mean that is, it happened to be the place that I chose in part, partly out of convenience, partly out of the fact that I actually wanted to study either Norfolk or, or Richmond [Virginia] and at one point I actually thought I was gonna do a comparative study in Norfolk and Richmond.  I mean I realized I was not gonna finish on my time schedule if I tried to undertake that at that particular point in time.  And, and today's world the big difference is, is that so much, a lot of the data that in those days you had to go from here to there to everywhere to try to track down, has been digitized.  And meaning what you really need is some kind of organizer that allows you to pull out the information to go and look at materials.  So I would say yes, African American, perhaps, but not a great sense in my mind that I was from Norfolk per se, because I mean other than talking to a few people it, it didn't really influence or shape in a particular kind of way my understanding because to be honest I didn't know anything about that history and most of the people I was talking to didn't either.
Speaker 1: They didn't have the context.
Speaker 2: They didn't have to context
Speaker 1: They were living at--
Speaker 2: They lived in it, they lived through parts of the experience, they knew their own individual piece but they didn't, they couldn't place it in a broader context.
Story_ID: 106045
Speaker 1: Okay, so what about in the academy, the, the non-African American aspect?  I mean predominance--
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: I won't even say, you know, less--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --I mean the numbers in the academy I don't, who are they in terms of Ph.D.s and (unclear) (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: The number of African Americans earning Ph.D.s, at least in history is flat for the, the most part.  And there's a little bit of growth but generally speaking it's been flat for, for some time.  And but it, for me there are two sets of questions, one is about the field itself and whether or not it is viewed as legitimate.  So I can remember, and I'm hope we're beyond this but we're not entirely, I can remember at, at Michigan [University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, Michigan] having dinner with my former colleagues, David Hollinger and [James] Jim Turner.  David is now at Berkeley [University of California, Berkeley in Berkeley, California] and Jim's at Notre Dame [University of Notre Dame in Notre Dame, Indiana].  And I think we were at Jim's house.  And I was telling them about a long range project I wanted to work on, on black school teachers.  And, and David couldn't understand how I could work on black teachers without studying white school teachers.  And I kept asking him, "Why is one group normative and the other one not?"  And we have been asking that same question to one another now for twenty-something years 'cause there's this way in which in David's framing of things, race doesn't exist, race doesn't matter, and, and, you know.  And in my frame of things he, it, it had, race has mattered mightily--
Speaker 1: (Unclear)
Speaker 2: --and continues to matter.  And for historians to try to essentially write it out of the narrative does as much damage as, as anything else.  And so that's what I was saying, I am hoping that we've gotten beyond this but I know, I don't-- and I mean,  I saw David recently and I think David still retains some reluctance his (unclear) ethnic America still is his vision of where Ishmael's Irishness gets to be noted as much as the fact that he's black.  This is Ishmael Reed.  And, and all, and I used to say to David, "I know Ishmael.  If Ishmael walked down the street of Oakland [California], they're not seeing him as an Irish guy, (laughter) he's a black man in America."  And that was the irony in Ishmael actually in writing this piece that David references.  Ishmael knew this.  I mean it's like, okay.  So there's that part where I think the academy, we aren't finding some of those same concerns.  But I know there's still residue of this notion about when does race matter, how does African Americans, can you please tell a story about African Americans that's quote, unquote "not comparative?"  For the next generation and for the young people who are coming up, I hope they feel free to ask questions I hadn't even thought of yet.  I mean there's this way in which when I read the literature that I do, where I think, "Okay.  There's still a lot more to be asked and there are new ways of seeing things."  And I was over in South Africa this summer and new cross-national comparative ways of asking questions and relationships that were formed that need to be explored, and I'm hoping that our students are encouraged one, to believe they can go on to get Ph.D.s.  Two, that the academy in its attempts to deal with these dislocations and the feeling of being under siege doesn't retreat so much from the old perspective that we need a certain kind of faculty to instruct our students.  I've been in a lot of conversations in the last year or two where people question both the viability of the tenure model and the importance of tenure track.  And without some assurance, then the research scholar, as we've known it at least since the middle of the 20th century, could disappear.  What replaces that individual is an open question so.  Anyway I (unclear) ruminate on these topics.  There's a lot about the changes in higher education, let alone the use of new technologies in, in how people will use those new technologies both to teach and instruct but also to conduct research and, and what we need.  I mean if I have concern I, I had a meeting here in this room a week or so ago and one college president was making a note if you look at the number of African American young men in the United States who take, who are in the eighth grade you follow that cohort until they're in the tenth grade and you go from about five or six hundred thousand to about two hundred thousand or less but by the time you get to a senior in high school, how many of them have scored high enough score on the, ACT or the SAT to get into one of America's most selective colleges and universities?  And you go from hundreds of thousands down to a few hundred thousand down to a few hundred.  And that funneling effect in and of itself is loaded with a set of perverse disincentives all along.  And so by the time we get to the kid who imagines that he or she wants to be an academic (unclear) they have beat every odd in every step of the way.  And, and for the health of our society we need to figure out why we want that big funnel to narrow so sharply.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 106585
Speaker 1: Some ways the, the piece in the 1940s that produced, we dealt with NSF [National Science Foundation] being created and then NIH [National Institutes of Health].  When Congress got around to creating NEH [National Endowment for the Humanities] and NEA [National Endowment for the Arts] in the 1960s, they never did it with the same commitment.  So if you think about it, for research related activities in humanities we, we, the [Andrew W.] Mellon Foundation, provides more money on an annual basis than NEA and NEH combined.  The City of New York Commission for the Arts [sic, Art Commission of the City of New York] spends more money on culture and artists than the entire United States government.
Speaker 2: Wow.
Speaker 1: And so, and if you talk Carol Watson it, a lot of it starts with not just the right wing nuts, probably pejorative but it is, who, who wanna get rid of NEH and NEA for their own particular political reasons.  But it's also even in the White House and how the White House begins to think about how much money should go into this budget versus that budget?  And, and as I remind people, and this is the challenge right, I can remind people before STEM [Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics] was STEM it was SMET.  And I was in Washington [D.C.] at a meeting in the NSF and they were all talking about SMET.  I'm thinking, "SMET, what's SMET?"  Science, math, engineering, technology.  Well, apparently I mean the, the piece I read where some member of NSF went over to the [Capitol] Hill and was talking about SMET and some Congress person "SMET" as "smut."  And said, "Why do we wanna give money to smut?"  And the folks at NSF then decided oh, we better change these letters around and so they went from SMET to STEM.  And, and it took a few years for STEM to gain hold but now STEM is talked about all over the world.  I, I was, had a conversation about STEM in Brazil and STEM in South Africa and STEM in India, in the last couple of years.  And STEM in China, let alone in the U.S. and so.
Speaker 2: And we even have STEAM, they're taking the arts.
Speaker 1: Exactly.  It take, STEAM and the arts stay, humanities get left aside--
Story_ID: 106586
Speaker 1: So what about your view of the humanities and what it needs to do for its place in the twenty-first [Century] and as we move forward?
Speaker 2: Well, I think there are, there are three things and I can be really crisp here.  One, I think the humanities need to think about themselves in relationship to the other areas.  And so I think that in large measure the director of the NEH [National Endowment for the Humanities] needs to have conversations with his or her counterpart at NSF [National Science Foundation] and NIH [National Institutes of Health].  They should actually have offices for the humanities in NSF and NIH and, because I don't believe in this Congress, that you can get them to double, triple, quadruple, the budget for the National Endowment for the Humanities.  But one may be able to get a piece in the NSF budget, in the NEH budget to study, NIH budget rather, to study some aspect for medical humanities to the ways in which systems of knowledge are, are brought together and so.  So, so that's one.  Second piece I, I would say for humanities is in taking a report from the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and really systematically thinking through what pieces need to be acted upon.  And so there's a lot there by K through 12, and that's a long term strategy if you're actually gonna go through K through 12.  What's the intermediate strategy and what's the immediate strategy, meaning its unfortunate with the turnover in leadership in a, at the American Academy, they need someone to sort of take that on.  We launched a report and then Leslie [Cohen Berlowitz] resigned and it, it's still a report to be finalized in a, a certain kind of way.  So that's the second part.  And then third, I believe and this is the piece, it's for people, entities like Mellon [Andrew W. Mellon Foundation] and others to actually attach their names in a public way to the importance of the humanities in daily life. And the way I usually explain it and I say to people, I can remember a conversation with a, an executive from one of the automobile industries, companies in, Michigan some years ago.  I was in Michigan, this person was talking about the importance of education and it was so much about engineering.  And so in the end I said to him, I says "I love the, the way you're thinking about gear ratios and, and torque and, and all," I said, "But who designs your car?  Don't you need artists in there to design the cars?"  He said "Yeah."  I said, "Now but you also need anthropologist right?"  He said, "Why would we need anthropologists?"  I said, "Well, if you are gone paint your car orange and you're gonna sell that in the Netherlands or some place in Europe, it may have historical significance, and you need an anthropologian historian to tell you that that shade of orange may actually go back to a particular kind of war and period and that certain people are not gone buy that color, car because it has the wrong color.  And so you need somebody there who has some sense of history and all because you would have produced a product that's not gone sell, not because the gear ratio was bad or the spacing was bad, it's because you chose the wrong color for the wrong place in given its history."  I said, "now if you think about this, you extrapolate the building of a car is an interdisciplinary activity. It's not just the engineers, because at some point you're gonna need somebody to market that car.  So you're gonna need somebody with a degree in psychology who's a, and who knows something about sociology and not just business but how you market it.  How, what activates the brain in a certain way to make this look attractive.  And then you'll need somebody who understands something about science and scale, and who knows that this car is actually gonna fit on the streets in Buenos Aires [Argentina], because this car that fits in Buenos Aires may not be the same car that fits in Detroit [Michigan]." And so well we got into a conversation and I say, "So even if we start with STEM [Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics] and engineering, if you're producing a product that's gonna sell, you find that you're moving into the humanities and the arts. And so it can't be alone.  You can't do one without the other."  And if, if and so, how do you begin to talk about all of them as a integrated set of activities to be fully educated and to produce a workforce that will command the attention of the world?  And I think we, Steve Jobs actually figured that part out.  It was not just to produce a tool, he wanted one that looked cool, it felt cool, and had a certain kind of aesthetic appeal to it.  That's important.  Getting more people to talk about it that way and so, that we understand that focusing on one piece will not get us all the way to the where we need to be.
Story_ID: 106587
Speaker 1: So I, you know, I've been thinking about also where you began, I was thinking of the little boy, you know, who (laughter) you know, what were you pulling the chairs out?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was pulling the chairs out.
Speaker 1: (Laughter)
Speaker 2: I was being mischievous.  And, I didn't tell about the tacks I would throw every now and then (laughter).
Speaker 1: And I think of where you are now.  I mean it's, you know, we, we often mainly because sometimes in our society we have limited views of success--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But yours is definitely a success story in lots of, you know, where you were and it's an American story.  And I'm wondering if you could sort of talk of your journey?
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: You know--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Now I, I sit back, and now my mom [Virginia Carr] died in 2006, my father [Earl Lewis, Sr.] died in 1961, my grandmother [Susan James] died in 1983, my grandfather died, maternal grandfather [Clifton James] died in 1976.  And so the framing between 1961 with my father, 2006 with my mother, and my grandparents in between and my, my mom's sister, my aunt, would die the next after my mom, in 2007, and her brother would die in 1990s.  And there were, you know, a range of people.  And so I, every now and then, I imagine my ancestors in a way looking down at me and smiling.  Because two things happened.  Not only have I in some ways beaten the odds, growing up in this working middle class neighborhood in Norfolk, Virginia and Tidewater of a mom who was a school teacher and youth counselor and father who was a custodian and, and my stepfather [Louis Carr], my mom remarried, who had been a store manager at a state alcohol store.  And so their worlds and the worlds that I have gotten to be part of, I mean, I have, you know, I visited places all over the world.  I have met with dignitaries large and small all over the world, including current [HM Barack Obama] and former Presidents of the United States.  And, and, and I smile 'cause I realize I was fortunate than almost all of my friends.  It's not just me, my brother [Rudolph Lewis] and I both did.  And, and, and I realize that it would have been even more difficult had I achieved and he hadn't.  But as a vice president at, at, Raytheon, now he was a vice president in ITT [Corporation], we both beat the odds.  And it's that piece that is sort of great where I say to my kids and to my kids friends, you can never predict where you're gonna end up but what you can control is the steps you take to be some place other than where you were the day before.

Speaker 1: And so my journey has not been linear, I've had setbacks, and clearly you lose your father at, at an early age in most people's lives that's a setback.  Not every job I applied for came my way.  Not everything that I hoped for, was I was able to achieve.  But every five years I would say to myself, "What do I wanna do next?  Do I wanna continue to do what I'm doing or do I wanna be someplace else?"  I used to always say to my students, "Plan your life in five increments, live your life in ten year periods."  So think about the next decade, live in the five years and give yourself some freedom to slip from where you think you're gonna be.  But if you give yourself that ten years and that's what's you're aiming toward, in most cases you'll get there.  And, and it's not always in the ways that you imagined.  And so for me is this sense that when I was a little kid growing up in Virginia, and, and I was telling a friend this story recently, I can remember in elementary school when someone said to me "Earl, what do you wanna be when you grow up?"  And I said, "President of the United States."  It's 1961, '62 [1962], and, and I thought back a bit later, I had no reason to believe in 1962 that I could be President of the United States.  Now that I've seen Presidents of the United States I'm like un, un, I don't wanna be President of the United States any longer.  But, but this notion that I can could be something that I wasn't supposed to be, is a dream that I think too many folks give up on early on.  You have to prepare for it, and you have to be prepared to deal when, when you lose your way along the way.  And, and this was brought home to me.  I was in South Africa in June in Grahamstown, which is about an hour, hour and half north of Port Elizabeth at Rhodes University.  And one of the faculty there took me and my son and-Max [Lewis] and, and Susan [Whitlock], my wife out to one of the community centers that they work with in this university community partnership.  And there was a group of South African youth in this community center and they went there after school because it was a place where they had computers and they could get tutoring and they had Khan Academy up and a whole range of other things.  And so they introduce and they perform and they told us stories.  And then finally we went in our room, I says, "So what do you wanna be?"  And what was the most powerful thing is they were 14, 15, 16, 17 years old and they all had dreams.  They all could tell, say "This is what I would like to be."  And not a one of them was mute.  They all had it.  And as we were driving back I said to the faculty member I said, "So how many of these kids," and then to the head of the school, "How many of these kids from this township have ever made it up the road to Rhodes, in the history of Rhodes University or in the recent history post-apartheid history of Rhodes University."  And the answer was "Five, no more than ten."  So I realized the gulf between what these kids wanted and the potential realizing it, which was just up the road, was much wider than one would think achievable.  But I thought, but they'll never get there if they don't have a dream.  And so what I've tried to hold on too and as I sort of look at where I am today, is that while it's a different variant, I've held on to the dream of one day I could become President and here I am.

Speaker 1: Two last questions.  What do you want to be remembered for?
Speaker 2: I'd love to be remembered for over the course of a life of, of helping others and that it was not only about me or always about me or ever about me.  That what I did was to create opportunities so that others could become the best they could become.  In fact, if people, I mean the day I die and someone says that in my eulogy, I would be smiling.
Speaker 1: And your legacy?
Speaker 2: My legacy is, would be threefold I guess.  One is that on the scholarly side, that someone would find long after I'm gone some reason to debate and argue with some of the things I wrote years later.  I mean I used to always say to, to my students and to myself "The one way to achieve immortality, is to write something that other people still have to argue over."  And so if some period of time people were still remembering, arguing, considering that would be one.  Second legacy is actually is a personal one and it relates to my own family and, and my children.  Which is, is that they get to grow up Max [Lewis] and Suzanne [Lewis] get to live full and rich lives.  Full of both of intrigue and possibility and knowing that it's not always what they had expected but at their control.  If I can get them to understand that their dreams are achievable dreams and all, that would be a powerful legacy and, and getting them to work on it.  And then the last legacy I guess is to help create, it's help to-- institutions that I believe in to continue to endure, may be at the foundation or the universities or the other kinds of things to (unclear) sure that it's about this next 5 years and the next 10 years or 15 years but a hundred years, 200 years, some aspect of what they're doing still endures.  If I can play a small role in any of that I'd be happy.  And, and what I've come to learn, I learned when I was five, was reminded again last year when Jayne [London] died, and that all the time in between, you never know when the clock's gonna stop for you.  So enjoy it while you can, maintain a sense of humor, take whatever you do seriously, without taking yourself to seriously, and invite other people in, so.
Speaker 1: That's it.  Thank you.
Speaker 2: Thank you.
