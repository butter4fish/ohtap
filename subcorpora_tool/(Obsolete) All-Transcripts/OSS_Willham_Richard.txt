 Larson  Willham  Okay. Well, I   m Mary Larson, and I   m here with Dr. Richard Willham.  Today is June 10, 2011, and we   re here in the basement of the  president   s house, or Willham House, right off of the campus of OSU.  Dr. Willham, can you tell me a little bit about when and where you were  born and where you were raised?  Okay. I was born in 1932, right in the middle of the Dust Bowl and the  Depression. My folks were at Panhandle A M College in Goodwell at  the time. I always laugh. My mother was an old maid school teacher,  and so she needed to have a cesarean to have me. The only place close to  Goodwell was Hutchinson, Kansas, so they went up there, and I was  born in Hutchinson, Kansas. Now, they gave these beautiful birth  certificates from the hospital, and I carried this sucker around for  twenty-five or thirty years. I got in the Army. I got out of the Army. I  got in Oklahoma State and out of Oklahoma State, no problem. And  when I went to get my first passport, I didn   t have a birth certificate, so I  had to dash madly to Topeka and get it (Laughs) because I had really  forgotten that I had been born there and not in Oklahoma or anyplace  else.  So you started out when you were young at Goodwell?  Goodwell. Goodwell was a beautiful little place, because these people  were clannish like you couldn   t believe. They loved that panhandle, and  they were going to stay there, come hell or high water. The only nasty  thing I ever heard my dad say was about Steinbeck   s The Grapes of  Wrath because he eulogized those people, not the ones that stayed, and  this just infuriated him. (Laughs) My mother and he, one was dean of  women; the other was dean of men. They were in charge of the dorms.  One evening, they got the word, and they went to the girls    dorm. A man  jumped out the window who had planned to stay there all night. They  caught him and kicked him out of school. His name happened to be  5  Larson  Willham  Larson  Willham  Larson  Willham  Larson  Willham  Larson  Willham  Harold Groendyke, who was the Enid oil magnate, lived in the  penthouse in the hotel at Enid all his life. These Groendyke trucks kept  driving by, and so, of course, I got the story several times.  One day, we were walking in Oklahoma City, and Harold walked up and  he says,    Why, how do you do, Susan?    and he pulled his hat off and  doffed it clear to the pavement and just gave her the real,    Glad to see  you.    It   s almost the first time I ever saw Susan stomp her feet. She was  still mad at Harold. They really enjoyed Goodwell. That   s where they  got married, where they did all sorts of things. During this time, Oliver  went up in the summers and got his master   s degree at Iowa State from a  man by the name of  Lush . He babysat fraternities as a means of having  board and room. Susan and her cousin went to Columbia, and she and  her cousin got their master   s degree at Columbia. We went to New York  once. Well, it was    39 at the World   s Fair. Susan had to go to one of  these plays that she so dearly loved, so she sent Oliver and I to The  Wizard of Oz, the movie. After the movie, Judy Garland and Mickey  Rooney came out and danced and sang for us. We always figured we got  the better of the deal.  Well, how did your folks meet?  Oh. (Laughs) There were quite a number of ladies that taught at  Goodwell. There was a drama/English teacher, an artist, and they were  sisters, and they had a mother. There was a couple of others that were in  contention. Of course, Oliver was the only young bachelor around. He  finally got with Susan, and they were married in 1928, after four years.  What had she been teaching?  Home ec. She was what turned out to be dean of women at the end, so  that   s how they kind of got organized.  So you grew up for the first few years in Goodwell.  Yes. I don   t remember a thing.  That   s what I was wondering, if you remembered any of that.  Right. No, I don   t remember a thing, yes.  Now, you would remember growing up in Stillwater, though.  Oh, yes, yes. Every four years, the president changed with the governor,  and that   s why this Board of Regents is such a blessed event, because  they don   t do it that way anymore. Oliver and Susan neither one could  6  Larson  Willham  Larson  Willham  get along with the new one that was appointed. The old one was named  Fanning, and he was a prince of a guy. Oliver talked to Iowa State, and  they went up there in 1935. They quit their job at Panhandle A M, and  you just didn   t do that then, because you had a job. They went up there,  and Dr.  Jay  Lush, the major professor, paid Oliver on assistantship the  same amount that he got at Panhandle A M College.  The Dust Bowl and the drought affected different parts of the country  drastically, so we moved to the Lincoln Way Apartments in Ames.  When Esther and I started graduate school at Ames, we talked to them  and moved into the same apartments, but they weren   t the same by then.  We got introduced to prostitutes. We got introduced to men that lived  together, all kinds of things that our na  ve education didn   t allow for. I  hadn   t been in the Army yet. I got my master   s in a year and then went  to Korea in the Army.  The reason we came back to   well, in 1935, a man by the name of W.  A. Craft had been in the Animal Husbandry Department, and he and the  major professor Oliver wanted to work with had got their PhDs with   Leon Jacob  Cole, who was the epitome of geneticists for livestock at  the University of Wisconsin. Craft went back to Ames as the Regional  Swine Breeding Coordinator. Blizz, Warren Lale Blizzard, was head of  the department then. He hired Oliver to take Craft   s place as the swine  breeder, which they did, and they moved to Stillwater. We lived in a rent  house on Duck. That was all right because the lieutenant governor lived  at the other end, and the Blizzards lived in the middle at that time.  And what year was that?  Thirty-five.  Thirty-five, okay.  Yes, and then probably    36 or    37 we moved into 120 Orchard Lane.  Oliver paid four thousand dollars for that house. I thought it was a dump  to start with, but I don   t think they did a thing to it in all the years that     and I lived there until I got married and left for graduate school. In the  evenings, Oliver always had to go back to work with these swine  records, so we   d go back in the evenings, and he   d turn me loose in that  old animal husbandry building. They had a bronze bull that was, oh, it   d  fit on this table, great big sucker, and it had two beautiful curving horns,  like this. (Gestures) I used to polish the horns when I was a kid. It was  on a rickety old table, and it   s beautifully situated now over in Animal  Science. That was my favorite bull. Much later on, I had an art  exhibition in which I used that bull and the other three that came from  Chicago.  7  Larson  Willham  Larson  Willham  Larson  Willham  Larson  Willham  Larson  Willham  Larson  Willham  Larson  So you   ve gone from being born in Hutchinson, Kansas, raised for the  first three years in Goodwell, then to Iowa State for a short term, for a  year, and then back to Stillwater.  Then to Stillwater.  Which wasn   t back to Stillwater for you. It was just coming to Stillwater  for you for the first time.  Yes, for me, yes. We totally grew up here. Esther and I, my wife and I  both, are from Stillwater.  What was the   you mentioned the neighborhood on Duck, but what was  the neighborhood like on Orchard Lane?  Oh, it was a beauty. At Stillwater, we had three white Russian  professors. One of them was across the street. They had  Doberman  Pinscher  dogs, and those suckers would chase me when I was walking  home, and it just scared the woolies out of me. We had several breeders,  professors, and that sort of thing. One guy ran the Bell Telephone  Company, the closest neighbors. One of them was a Mrs.  Alice  Traver,  and she was over in English. She built an old English cottage, and it   s  still over there on Orchard Lane. The paint would come off of it, and it  was this beautiful brick, and it was just covered with ivy. I thought that  was the best looking house in town.  Just magical, right?  Yes.  What was Stillwater, as a whole, like when you were growing up?  Stillwater and Ames, Iowa, were exactly the same. (Laughs) Not much  industry. The big deal was the university. About twenty thousand to start  with. I can remember going from a thousand to two thousand students  and that sort of thing. It wasn   t what it is now, at least not big business. I  thought it was kind of sleepy because friends in high school, we tried to  get in trouble and couldn   t. (Laughs)  Nothing like a small town for keeping you in line. (Laughs)  Yes, exactly.  Having been in university towns most of your life, how do you think that  balance colors a town?  8  Willham  Larson  Willham  Larson  Willham  Larson  Willham  Larson  Willham  Larson  Willham  Oh, I never met anybody that couldn   t read or write. They had a black  town in Stillwater, and we just never saw them. They had their own  school, and so only if we hadn   t had the football stadium down there,  we   d have never seen them.  What area of town was that?  That was on Ninth Street as you go down in the flat, where it flooded.  The school is still there. I drove by it the other day, but it   s closed up.  Our school was just up the hill a little ways, on Duck.  Now, having grown up in Stillwater   and I   m assuming you went to  Stillwater High School.  Yes.  Was there any question of where you would go to college when you got  to this point?  Oh, you   ve got to hear this one  (Laughter) Listen, this is just hilarious,  and I   ve got it all written down. When I was about a junior in high  school, the three of us were eating lunch over at Orchard Lane. I said,     I   ve figured out where I want to go to school.    That got their attention,  and they said,    Oh, where would you like to go to school?    I said,    I   d  like to go to Texas A M so I can be in the Corps and wear those boots  and spurs as a senior.    My dad jumped up from his seat, stuck his finger  in my face, and he says,    I   ve been all over this state telling mothers and  fathers and kids to come to Oklahoma A M.    He said,    By God, if it   s  good enough for them, it   s good enough for you     And I never asked  again. (Laughs)  Well, I mean, it sounds like in your family, though, you have a tradition  of having both Oklahoma State and Iowa State.  Oh, yes, yes.  Which you later did as well.  That   s where I went, right back up there. Well, they had the best   that  was the Mecca for the field that both my dad and I were interested in.  But the interesting thing is, I thought when I got all trained, I could sit  there and talk with him about it, but by that time, he must   ve figured that  it had passed him by. Never once would he talk with me about livestock  breeding. It was really funny.  9  Larson  Willham  Larson  Willham  Larson  Willham  Larson  Willham  Larson  Willham  Larson  Willham  Larson  Did you talk about that when you were younger?  No.  It seems like you had a longtime interest in it.  Oh, yes. Of course, we went out and weighed pigs every Saturday.  When I was working with the testing station at Iowa State, I   d ask the  breeders, I said,    How do you weigh your pigs?       Well, we don   t weigh  them. We don   t have any scales at our farm.    I said,    What the hell do  you do on Saturday morning?    (Laughter)  That   s just what you do  (Laughs)  That   s just what you do, yes.  Well, when you started at Oklahoma A M, did you know at the time that  you wanted to go into the field that you ended up in?  Yes.  Okay, you were already set when you got here.  Well, I didn   t get here. I just walked over.  Walked over. (Laughs)  No, this was a real trauma for me because, already, my dad was  associate dean of agriculture in charge of resident instruction. He had to  sign every leave slip and everything those kids had, because there  weren   t that many of them. That was trauma enough. Then, in a year, he  was the president. I finally just sat down, and I said,    I   m damned if I do  or damned if I don   t. I   ll just do what I can, and to hell with them,     which I did. I made two Bs in college and was first colonel of the cadet  corps, co-chairman of religious emphasis week, chancellor of Alpha  Zeta, and all sorts of things and had a beautiful time. I never did know  whether this had occurred because who my dad was or whether I had  done it. When we finished basic infantry officers course at Fort Benning,  Georgia, about twenty of us got to go to the Far East, and we got to go to  the Korean occupation. I got over there. There wasn   t anybody in that  whole Army that knew who I was or knew who my old man was. I  figured out pretty quick I was a damn good second lieutenant, so that  solved the problem for me. (Laughs)  You had to get some outside perspective.  10  Willham  Larson  Willham  Larson  Willham  Larson  Willham  Larson  Willham  Larson  Willham  Larson  Willham  Yes, and I was very useful to the Army and knew what to do and so on,  so that was kind of the way it was.  Yes, but I would imagine that would be tough. I mean, you   ve grown up  in Stillwater, at least the time that you can remember...  Yes.     and for as long as you   ve been here, you   ve been around people who  have known you, known your family.  Right, yes, yes.  It   s hard to be able to evaluate yourself.  Just really how good you are. It really is.  Well, and certainly from the way your career went after you left  Oklahoma A M, you obviously had quite a career.  Yes. (Laughs) Well, that   s   you want to know why I   m not an  administrator? I was here on the faculty from    63 to    66. Probably about     64, Oliver called at my office and says,    Meet me down at the car. I  want to talk with you.    So I walk downstairs and walk to the parking lot  and found the car. I opened the door and sat down. He looked at me, and  he said,    Richard,    he says,    If you ever give up that job of professor     it   s the best one in the world  Don   t ever give it up     And I never did. I  also was diabetic. I have been for fifty years. I couldn   t have. He didn   t  realize that. I mean, he wouldn   t accept it.  What I wanted to say was Oliver never met anybody that wasn   t his  friend. He had friends everywhere. Oh, and I need to tell you how he  could remember names. But Susan was very private. She had very good  friends, but very few. Just completely opposite. And, of course, I was  raised by my mother so I have good friends.  So you were talking about how     How he remembered names.  Right.  When he was at the dean   s office, he had a fantastic secretary named  Inez Atha. She worked for the university her entire life, but she was his  secretary. When a kid would come by to see Oliver, she would bring him  that guy   s records, and he could see every thing  the guy  had done ,  11  Larson  Willham  Larson  Willham  Larson  Willham  Larson  Willham  Larson  Willham  Larson  Willham  Larson  Willham  what his parents    names were, what he had done in his career to date,  and all that sort of thing. Then he attached that to who he was looking at  and talking with. He never had to ask anybody   s name. I mean, he could  see them on the campus, and he could call them by name. When he  found out how valuable it was, then he learned how to do it without the  crutch of seeing it written. And I learned that I could do it, too. I kept  swine records, and when I   d meet the swine breeders, I   d attach them to  their records. I had no trouble calling them by name because that was  easy. I got so interested in trying to make conversation that it just passed  me by.  More your mother   s son, in that regard?  Oh, yes, yes.  Now, you were saying that when you started, your dad was over   when  you started at A M, your dad was     He was in the dean   s office.     in the dean   s office, and then within a year he became president.  Yes.  Do you want to talk a little bit about what you remember about what  happened at the time?  Well, nothing really did, in terms of much change, except I was living at  the SAE  Sigma Alpha Epsilon  house. The first real big event was  Susan having the stroke. Oliver asked me to move home, which I did  and stayed there for the last three years of college, on Orchard Lane.  When they got her to the hospital that day     I mean, it was right after your father became president, after Henry  Bennett passed away.  Yes, yes.  Why don   t you take the story from there.  Let me start somewhere else. This one   s too good for you to miss.  Okay. (Laughs) We don   t want to miss a thing.  In the late    40s, I rode my bike to high school up College Avenue, past  the president   s home near the old chemistry building, and on some  12  Larson  Willham  Larson  Willham  Larson  Willham  Larson  Willham  Larson  Willham  Larson  Willham  mornings would exchange waves with President Henry Garland Bennett  as he was viewing Theta Pond. Had I known what would transpire later,  I would have waved harder, but because of the hill, I was usually tired  by then. In    51, Bennett took leave to head the Point Four Program for  President Truman. Bennett selected three men to be vice-president at  OAMC. One was  Philip  Donnell, a business manager, the other,  Randall Klemme, in economics, and Oliver Willham, associate dean of  agriculture in charge of resident instruction. He made Oliver executive  vice-president, laughingly saying he was the only one who would give  him his job back. (Laughter) But the leave was not for long. Dr. Bennett  and his wife were both killed, landing at the Tehran Airport in Iran. I   ll  never forget the funeral held in Gallagher Hall. The backdrop to the  podium was a wall of flowers sent from everywhere.  Now, what was the mood on campus at the time?  Oh, everybody was just beside themselves. They didn   t have a clue what  to do. It was really   well, they   d had several before, but he was the one  that started to put this place on the map, and they didn   t want to lose  that. He was also a politician. He was from Durant, Oklahoma. He and  his buddies sold textbooks, and I never did follow anything about that.  So you would   ve grown up knowing him, I mean, in town here and with  your dad.  I didn   t see him much except early in the morning, riding to high school.  So that was your first year? Would that have been your first year of  college or your second?  No, that would have been in high school.  Oh, in high school.  Yes, I rode to Stillwater High.  Oh, no, no, but I was thinking the plane crash. Was that while you were  still in high school?  Yes, yes.  Okay.  No, that was    51, I think, and then he was president in    52. I was  already   I started college in    50.  13  Larson  Willham  Larson  Willham  Larson  Willham  Larson  Willham  Larson  Willham  Larson  Willham  Larson  Willham  Larson  Willham  Larson  Willham  That   s what I thought. I was just trying to get the chronology straight.  Yes, now let me finish something else.  Sure.  One of the many problems lying on Bennett   s desk when Oliver took it  was the Johnny Bright case. A star, Drake  University , black football  player had had his jaw broken in a game at OAMC. The coach then,   J.B.  Whitworth, considered that was the way to play football, but the  Des Moines Register made headline news over the entire country. The  coach lived next door to us on Orchard Lane, but he shortly left. The  story finally simmered to a close. That is not bad for a green president  for a starter. (Laughs)  So that   s the first thing he had to deal with.  First thing that hit him between the ears, yes. Oh, gosh  (Laughs)  Was there the sense that it was the whole     Intentional.     intentional, but racially motivated, or just football?  Just football.  I was going to say, because football is     That   s the only thing   because, Lord, I played at Stillwater High, and if  there was a star player from Cushing or Ponca City or someplace, our  coach would tell us to see if you can get him out of the game.  It   s just football.  It   s just standard practice, (Laughs) but they didn   t make it that.  Okay, so your father became president then.  Yes, the Regents asked him to, yes.  He   d already been stepping in while Bennett was out of the country, so  he   d been handling a lot of the day-to-day.  Yes, as executive vice-president, yes.  14  Larson  Willham  Larson  Willham  Larson  Willham  Larson  Willham  So the Johnny Bright case was one of the first things left over on the  desk.  Yes.  And then you mentioned that your mother had a stroke not long after.  Yes.  Do you want to talk a little bit about that?  She had her stroke in    52, the year that   and she was on her way to a  luncheon. She was the president   s wife for the first time, and she had  this stroke. A doctor found her. They got her to the hospital. She had a  doctor named Freed, Leon Freed, that lived in Perkins. Freed was there  when Oliver and I got   well, I got there and then Oliver got there. From  one o   clock to four, we paced the floor. Freed didn   t even take her  clothes off. They just laid her on the bed. I don   t think they took her  shoes off, so we knew right quick that it was a serious go.  About four o   clock that evening, Susan roused up just enough and said,     My head hurts.    I   ve never seen a man flip a lady over faster on her  back. He got a needle this long and tapped her spine with her clothes still  on. Tapped her spine, and when he drew it out, it was red. He said,     She   s had a stroke.    They started working then, and they saved her. She  had an aneurism in the Circle of Willis, in the back of her brain. It didn   t  mess up any particular part of the brain so she recovered without any  problems. She just always was weak, and so that was very fortunate. It  made a fantastic excuse to be the president   s wife as she wanted to be.  That sounds a little funny, but that   s just the way I mean it. I think it just  scared the woolies out of her, this job, and it would scare anybody.  Oliver was gung-ho like you couldn   t believe to do this job, or any job  that he ever had.  Well, and you mentioned, too, that your dad didn   t know a whole lot  about entertaining and that your mother really had that knowledge, but  may not have been so keen to     My mother was born in Ash Grove, Missouri. Her mother was a  Comegys, and they had St. Louis money. They owned stock in Boatman  Bank and some of the big St. Louis establishments. Her parents were  bankers in Ash Grove. She married this guy quite a few years older than  she was. His name was Elijah Ambrose Hurt. He was a drummer boy in  the Civil War. He prospected at Cripple Creek, Colorado, and he was a  livestock buyer around Ash Grove. He had a horse, and he went and  bought livestock and moved them himself to the stockyards there in that  15  Larson  Willham  Larson  Willham  Larson  Willham  Larson  Willham  Larson  little town and shipped them to Kansas City. That was how he lived. He  built his own house.  We went, at least Susan and I, went three or four times to Ash Grove,  after I could remember going. We always took the train. It was a fun  place to be. Susan had a sister who was named Myrtle. Myrtle was the  dominant kid in the family. She was six years older than Susan. When  Susan was born, she said,    I think I   d have rather had a pony.     (Laughter) I think this always affected Susan one way or the other. She  was very influential in my life because every summer we went to La  Jolla, California, to see Myrtle and stayed a month. I learned all about  civilization in California. I learned how to drive on the interstate that  was just started at that time, in a car, 1937 Packard that went thirty-five  miles an hour, max. Man, I got passed like you wouldn   t believe.  You mentioned that maybe because of her dominant sister, that explains  a little bit about why she preferred a    take this route    to being the  president   s wife.  Yes, right. Exactly, because Myrtle just dominated the works. She also  was the dietician for the officers    mess at Quantico, Virginia, during the  First World War.  That probably explains a lot, actually. (Laughs)  Yes, she ended up marrying a Marine much, much later.  Since we   re talking about your parents at this point, and we   ve talked a  little bit about your dad starting with the presidency at A M, did your  folks   my understanding is your folks kept the house at 120 Orchard  Lane, and you moved back there     After she had the stroke, yes.     after your mother   s stroke, so you were able to help out. Did they     because of her health issues, did they entertain a lot there or none at  all?  None. I think what Susan wanted to do   and it finally dawned on me,  this is what she was doing. She was making a refuge for Oliver. He  could come home at dinnertime, sit down, and they could eat quietly.  Then he always went in and had a nap for fifteen minutes, and then got  up and went back to work. I mean, he did this religiously his entire life.  So it was some place away from the office.  16  Willham  Larson  Willham  Larson  Willham  Larson  Willham  Larson  Willham  Larson  Willham  Larson  Yes. Now, they belonged to a Bridge club when they first came that was  partly animal husbandry and some biochemists and a bunch of those. I  dearly loved to sneak down the stairway and watch the going-ons when  they had this Bridge club. Other than that, there was no social     So there was personal socialization, but not entertaining on a university  scale.  Right, yes, yes.  So it wasn   t like the space here, where part of it   s very public, and part  of it   s very private.  Yes, right.  The whole thing was private. So, as you said, sort of a sanctuary or a  refuge.  Exactly. That finally hit me not too long ago, that that   s what she was  doing.  Do you remember your father having to host events at the university?  Did they have things elsewhere on the university campus in the Student  Union, or there were things he didn   t have to host, he just had to attend?  Yes, lots of them, the banquets, this, that, and the other. By that time, I  was going with my wife, and her mother was very upset that I had to eat  by myself all the time. Which, I mean, they   d just leave a note and say  they had to be at this banquet or that banquet or something, which was  fine with me because I could go eat where I wanted to, and proceeded to  do so.  Now, where were the places you and your friends liked to go to eat when  you had the chance back in the day?  The Lasso was across from Leachman Theater. They had those first  curly fries I   d ever eaten in my life. And then there was one that we  went to a lot, and it was right next to the Oldsmobile car place. I can   t  remember what the name of it was. Other than that, liked anywhere in  town.  I understand that your parents ended up rather indirectly funding the  president   s home that we   re in right now, and we talked a little bit about  that before we got started, but for people who don   t know the  background story, if you could explain a little.  17  Willham  Larson  Willham  Larson  Willham  Larson  Willham  Larson  Willham  Larson  Willham  Larson  Willham  Oliver got this entertainment fund, and it was to be used when the  Regents came and for   it was really probably getting ready for the era  we   re in now of    How do you get money?    This hadn   t crossed  Oklahoma State   s mind at this time. He just kept socking it away, and I  think it was close to  80,000 because he was the president for almost  fourteen years. By the time it was    60 or so, there was enough money  there to build the house because they didn   t cost as much as they do  now. So that at least started it, I   m sure. I think the Physical Plant built  it. I   m not sure.  Now, do you remember anything   I think you would have been in Iowa  at the time, but do you remember hearing your parents say anything  about the planning of the house, whether they had any input?  Oh, yes. I   m sure they   I know Susan did. Oliver did. Well, my son told  you things that I didn   t know, just a little bit ago, about it. (Laughs)  About the windows upstairs for the lighting in the eaves.  Yes, but anyway. I don   t     So do you remember hearing anything about the planning process from  your mom or your dad?  Not really.  Because you were busy with your own     We were raising kids and doing all that sort of thing.     busy with your own career at that point. Do you know anything about  the architect that worked on the house?  We   ve been having discussions about this because all of these people  that were here thought Phil Wilbur was the architect for Oklahoma State.  Turns out, he was, but he didn   t draw the plans for any building. He  would tell the group what he wanted, and let them bid. So he  inadvertently was the architect, but he wasn   t the draftsman that put it  together is the way we finally think it happened, but we don   t know.  Do you have any idea who might   ve been the person that did the draft  work?  No, not of the president   s house or any of the other, except  Williamsburg architecture. The first time I ever went to the Union after  it was finished   see, that   s where the power plant was before then,  18  Larson  Willham  Larson  Willham  Larson  Willham  Larson  Willham  Larson  Willham  Larson  Willham  Larson  Willham  Larson  Willham  down on Washington. Washington went all the way through. I walked  up two or three stairs on each side of the building, and there were  windows halfway up one floor to the next. Then it dawned on me that  they were supposed to be that way from the architecture outside.  (Laughs)  Do you remember when the house was finally finished?  Yes.  Was there a big grand opening event or anything?  Not that I was ever aware was there anything. They just moved in,  probably.  What was your first impression when you saw it the first time?  Well, I was impressed, but nothing special.  I didn   t know, since you would   ve been seeing it with your folks.  Yes, I know.  Did your folks first move into the house in    62, or was it closer to    61?  I really don   t remember.  Okay. And they were here until your father retired from the presidency  in    66.  Sixty-six, yes.  So you would have actually been back in Stillwater from    63 to    66?  Yes.  Were you around the house a lot more?  We built a house on Will Rogers, 319 Will Rogers. When you went up  to the end of the street, up level with this place, and then went over and  down just a little bit, there was a road that joined up with the president   s  road. You didn   t have to go out on Washington Street. Our daughter, the  one that has the stroke, used to ride her bicycle over there, little bitty  bicycle, and she   d go over and see Susan, and Lee would go on his  tricycle.  19  Larson  Willham  Larson  Willham  Larson  Willham  Larson  Willham  Larson  Willham  Larson  Willham  Larson  Willham  Larson  And your daughter is Karen, right?  Yes.  Yes, Karen and Lee.  And, of course, that   s a pretty steep deal. (Laughs) She had several  tumbles. It was gravel then, so she was really messed up. But the best  one on Karen was Granddad had been given this beautiful cedar tree,  just fit in this room here. It was outside, so he got Karen to help him  drag it in, and they drug it in. We got over here late, and we didn   t even  recognize our daughter. Her eyes were clear shut. She just was allergic  like nobody   s business to that cedar. (Laughs) It just had us in hysterics.  She was all right the next day, but, man, did it cost her.  How old was she at the time?  Oh, probably five or six or something like that.  Now, with the president   s residence, there probably wasn   t any more  entertaining going on here than there had been, but were there more  public areas to the house that you remember, or was it all just used as a  family home?  Just this one. Upstairs was used for them, and down here was the  occasional, like mortar board or something.  So the breakfasts and that sort of thing would be held.  Yes, and a lot of times they had nothing to do with it. The people would  come in and do it.  Did they have staff here that helped out with those events, or     They came in.  Okay, so it was just like having catering come in.  No permanent people at all. I was laughing with you about   well, I was  talking about Baker Bokorney. He turned out to be the hotel and  restaurant administrator over there in Home Ec, and Baker was a  classmate of mine at Stillwater High. He had to fix our Christmas dinner  and stuff, and, oh, it just embarrassed me to no end to have to have  Baker give us our food. (Laughs)  Someone you grew up with and knew real well.  20  Willham  Larson  Willham  Larson  Willham  Larson  Willham  Larson  Willham  Larson  Willham  Larson  Willham  Larson  Willham  Oh, gosh, yes.  Now, do you have any, besides the Christmas tree incident, do you have  any particular stories that you remember about your parents    time here?  Oh, Lord. Well, I   ve got to tell you one more.  You can tell me as many more as you want. (Laughs)  Oliver died in    74. We were in Europe, and we got back to Chicago and  were headed for Ames. I looked over at the message board, and I said,     Oh, we   ve been gone a couple weeks. Do you reckon anybody missed  us?    I walked over there and looked at it. It had our name on it, and it  says,    Call home.    We didn   t even go to Ames. We just called from  Chicago. Mrs.  Maxine  Kamm came up and got us into the plane and  took us back to Ames. Of course, we didn   t have many clothes. Oliver  was just holding on by a thread. Then about three days later he died.  Then we had the funeral. He was York Rite Grand Commandery, and  they wanted to do something, so he went out from the First Presbyterian  Church under drawn swords and chapeaus with ostrich feathers on them.  That   s when Esther says,    Why did you have that funeral on the first of  October?    She said,    Didn   t you remember its Lee   s birthday?    I   ll  never live that one down. But, anyway, that   s what happened.  You mentioned that she had a cake for him?  Mrs. Kamm, yes, yes...  Mrs. Kamm had a cake for him.     when we got home, when we got over here. That was very nice.  Does seeing the house again bring back a lot of memories? How long  has it been since you   ve been here?  Oh, yes. I haven   t been back here for ten or twelve years, I don   t expect.  How does it seem to have changed over time?  Oh, it   s beautiful. It   s beautifully kept and so on.  You mentioned that up on the first floor, when you first walk in, there  used to be a partition.  Yes.  21  Larson  Willham  Larson  Willham  Larson  Willham  Larson  Willham  Larson  Willham  Larson  Willham  Larson  Willham  Larson  Willham  Larson  Willham  So instead of the area where the dining room table is now, there was a  partition that went from over where the wall is for the fireplace     The fireplace all the way to the other partition.  Okay.  You could see out the back when you were in this small room, and the  bookcases were over there. You walked in, and when you came in the  house, you were up against this panel. You walked into a panel and went  right or left.  Okay, and on the other side of that panel there was a small room. Was it  like a sitting area there?  Yes, yes. That   s where Susan sat all the time and read.  Any other major changes or additions that you noticed coming in?  No, no.  And the rooms are pretty much laid out the same way?  Just like they were, yes.  Except that   oh, and you mentioned that the area to the left of the  kitchen as you   re facing the kitchen used to be a dining room, I guess.  It   s now a den.  It was the dining room, yes.  Do you have any other recollections on the house itself that you   d like  to     No, not really.  Let   s talk a little bit about your career. You graduated from Oklahoma  A M in 1954?  Fifty-four, yes.  And I guess before we proceed from there, we probably ought to get  your wife into the story and where she appeared in the picture.  Okay. I was given a mandate when I came to college, and that was,    If  22  Larson  Willham  Larson  Willham  we   re paying your way, you will not get married while you   re in  college.       Fine.    Well, I graduated the twenty-eighth day of May from  Oklahoma A M. We got married the first of June, and I was in graduate  school the fourteenth of June. So we played it like we were supposed to.  That   s how that occurred.  Okay, so you went up to Iowa State.  Yes, for a master   s degree. At that time, you could take a year off from  serving the two years in the military until you could spend a year, so I  went up to Iowa State and got a master   s degree in a year, which nobody  should ever do. Then I went to Korea, and Esther came back here and  stayed in the apartment and was working on her degree. Of course, it  was a real revelation to me to be in the Army because, as I told you, I   d  never met anybody that couldn   t read or write, and half my platoon  couldn   t read or write. I   d have to write letters for them, home. The only  thing they could do was make an X, and I was just absolutely  flabbergasted.  That   s not the only thing that I learned. I was given headquarters and  security platoon, and I was supposed to keep all the GIs out of the  village. There were three whores for every GI in the village, and so I had  my hands full. I stayed up until two and three at night. I court martialed  my entire platoon because they went to the village, too, and they didn   t  need to. Finally, the warrant officer said,    Willham,    he says,    I   m  going to let you interview these new people that come in from Repo  Depot, and you can choose what you want.    I said,    Fine.    I went in  there, and I picked big old farm boys that had just been married. They  didn   t go to the village, but they weren   t as crafty as the rest of the  criminals were. (Laughs)  It was just an absolute experience that I   d have never got otherwise, but  I learned a lot about people. It was very rewarding from that point of  view. Then I came back, and we went back to graduate school at Iowa  State and finished up, and got a job with them on swine breeding. We  stayed for four years, and then a job came open here, and we went to  Oklahoma State for three and worked with beef cattle. Then we went  back to Iowa State in    66 with beef cattle. Been there ever since.  What inspired you to come back to, I guess it would   ve been, OSU at the  time?  I couldn   t wait to get here. I knew all these guys. As far as I was  concerned, it was the place to be. It wasn   t as good as Iowa State, but it  was to me, so I roared back.  23  Larson  Willham  Larson  Willham  Larson  Willham  Larson  Willham  Larson  Willham  You had another opportunity, though, at Iowa State in    66.  Yes. It became rather evident that the leadership at Oklahoma State was  in transition. As I told you, I wasn   t going to be an administrator. I knew  I   d have to do it if I stayed, so I chose to go back to Iowa and be a  professor.  And you have done that the rest of     Yes, my entire life.     the rest of your time. Do you want to talk a little bit about what your  key areas of research have been throughout your career with genetic  prediction models and EPDs  Expected Progeny Differences  and     Yes, well, that was what I was   there was the research project with live  animals, and then there was another component to that, to deal with the  breeders and give them information to utilize, which I spend an awful lot  of time with. I got involved with a beef improvement federation, which  was the organization of beef cattle groups or organizations. We made a  whizzing go of that thing. We got sire evaluation. We got genetic  predictions. We did some things right. My mentor in that was Frank  Baker, and he had been here at Oklahoma State for a lot of the time.  When we were discussing things before we started the interview, you  had mentioned a little bit about how you   d been lucky enough to have  really great mentors over the years. Do you want to discuss that a little?  Oh, yes, this was one of them. The other one was Dwight Stephens, who  was superintendent of the El Reno experiment station when  Oklahoma   State got control of it. All the project cattle were down at El Reno when  I was working here. Dwight decided, since I   d been with pigs, that he   d  take me under his wing and make a beef cattle breeder out of me, which  he proceeded to do. He   s the only man that when I   d come home from a  trip, my wife would tell me,    I   m going to send you with him again. You  come home so nice.    (Laughter) He was a prince of a guy.  Now, I understand you created something called the computer cow  game, which was pretty innovative back in its day.  Oh, yes  (Laughs) When I got back to Iowa, I was putting a project  together. I had some time, and I   d been to Brown University for a little  seminar sort of thing for the summer. About forty of us went there on an  NSF  National Science Foundation  Fellowship to learn about teaching  population genetics. We had the instructors of the time. One of them had  a swine game in which he generated pigs, sows, and mated them to  24  Larson  Willham  Larson  Willham  Larson  Willham  Larson  Willham  Larson  Willham  boars, and with models we made their performance for the pigs and so  on. I thought,    Well, gee, I can do that with beef cows,    and so I did. I   d  give breeders fifty cows, mated to five bulls, ten apiece, and the calves,  and this was the output. They were to choose which bulls to use again,  or they could use a new bull that was in the calf crop, based on their  performance records.  For some reason, there was just enough competition in it to make that  game just go like Cracker Jacks. For forty years, almost every university  that teaches livestock breeding used that computer cow game. Iowa State  still does. It   s used internationally, and it   s just a fun game to play  because you start competing with your buddy that   s sitting there. We   d  do that with a group of breeders. We   d tell them how everybody was  doing. Man, I   ll tell you. They   d struggle over those records at night and  send it back. We did it by mail. It was very successful.  And from a teaching perspective, it really gives people a chance to see     They ask the questions you want them to ask.    How come that bull  didn   t do this?    Just perfect, yes, you got it.  So, what accomplishments in your career   I mean, you retired in    97.  Yes.  What accomplishments are you most proud of?  Well, working with the beef industry on the   EPD is a household word  for beef cattle breeders anymore, and I was instrumental in getting this  done, and all manners of genetic predictions.  For people who aren   t aware of what EPD stands for, could you     Expected Progeny Difference. It   s what you expect the progeny   how  you expect them to perform over some average. If it   s positive, it   s good.  If it   s minus, it   s not.  Now, what have you been doing since your retirement?  I   m trying to get a book published. In    72, I started teaching a course  that I called Our Livestock Heritage. It dawned on me that a lot of these  kids didn   t know where they came from. They didn   t know the aura of  romance that surrounded this business, so I decided I   d teach it to them.  So in    72 I started, and I still feel sorry for those first students I had  because they had to put up with a lot, but I got it down. I   ve got a book  about this that I   m working with the OU Press, University of Oklahoma  25  Larson  Willham  Larson  Willham  Press, to publish, and we   ll see how that goes. Oh, also, I did a history of  the animal science society, nationally. That took me two years to do. I  did a history of the Saddle and Sirloin Club that met in Chicago. It was a  gentleman   s club is what it was.  I understand you have a portrait there, too.  Yes, yes. That was 2004, but they have over three hundred pictures there  now in Louisville, in that fairgrounds. They were in Chicago when the  stockyards were still there.  I understand you   ve been involved in the art world.  Oh, yes  (Laughs) The director of the art museum   s a good friend of  mine. Always has been. She and a friend came to my office one day, and  they were looking around the wall. It   s just wall-to-wall pictures of  animals. Lynette says,    We ought to have an art show featuring the  images of animals.    I said,    Lynette, when do you want to have it?    She  said,    When   s the next time you   re going to have a meeting at Iowa  State that this would be appropriate for?    I said,    Four years from now,  the animal science meetings are going to be here, and we could do it.     She said,    Good, we   ll get to work. That   s just enough time.    I thought,     God, that is a long time     So I put together a list of what I wanted for  the art show.  Lots of them  were  in Chicago Art Museum and all of those places  because Esther and I had been to see all of them. You should   ve read  some of these letters. (Laughs)    We haven   t a clue where Ames, Iowa,  is.    I didn   t realize, but works of art have dossiers that go with them.    I  was shown at such and such a place,    and the more prestigious they are,  the better the deal. I didn   t know that. Lynette and I had enough faith in  each other. She had no business asking a university professor to be guest  curator for an art show, then fly. My colleagues thought I was absolutely  daft, so neither Lynette nor I had any support whatsoever. We just got  laughed at. Every so often we   d hug each other and say,    Well, we   ll  keep going.     We filled the Brunnier Gallery. It   s a big gallery for a university. We  filled it with works of art that had to do with livestock, including the  three bronze bulls, one of them from here and two of them from Iowa  State, for judging trophies. Had this show when the animal science  meetings were in Ames. Lynette says,    I   ve never been to an art show  where the people that came thought the art belonged to them.    She was  talking about those bulls the judging teams won as trophies, like ours. I  hadn   t even thought of that, and they just ate it up. It ran three months  and when we ended up   usually,  if  a three-month art show has four  26  Larson  Willham  Larson  Willham  Larson  Willham  Larson  Willham  Larson  Willham  Larson  thousand people, they   ve had a good show. We had 16,446 people come  through that, almost all of them on Saturdays and Sundays from farms  all over the state of Iowa. And Lynette, it put Lynette on the map, as far  as a director of a museum. It was just phenomenal, the success it had.  Having grown up as a farm kid, myself, it   s an exhibition for us.  Yes   I mean, the folks in those small towns can take ownership of something  like that.  Right. I invited a lady that   she and her sister have a restaurant in a little  bitty town in southern Iowa. She had probably the first print of The  Horse Fair by Rosa Bonheur. Wrinkled, and she had it in a little frame,  and it was up on the wall along with a lot of other stuff. I asked Gus if I  could have that for the art show because, of course, I couldn   t get the  real one. You couldn   t even move it, it   s so big. She said,    Oh, yes, you  could.    I invited Gus to come up. She had never been to Iowa State.  She brought all her cousins, young girls and kids. She was gussied up  like   I   d always seen her in bobby socks and sandals and a dress made  out of a feed sack when she was cooking, and, oh, she could cook good  food. She threw the water out the back door. There wasn   t any running  water in the place. Of course, that was a no-no. Had been for thirty years  in Iowa. She fed all the highway patrolmen and all the policemen for  twenty miles around, and nobody ever said a thing to Gus. (Laughs) But  she came up and brought her friends. I   ve never been so happy over  anything in my life as to see that.  Something else to be proud of. Now, we   ve covered a lot of territory. Are  there any things that we   ve missed that you   d like to address?  Yes.  Okay.  One more and we   ll give it a go. What do you know about Ethiopia and   Oklahoma  State   s involvement?  We   ve actually been doing a series of interviews on that.  Have you?  We had one person who was interviewing the husbands, and I was  interviewing the wives of some of the couples who have gone over.  27  Willham  Larson  Willham  Larson  Willham  Larson  Willham  Yes, I   ve been over there.  It   s very interesting, so what would you like to discuss with that?  You   ve heard about Haile Selassie coming over here in    57. It just  turned the social set upside down in Stillwater. It was just hilarious.  Esther   s mother sold dresses downtown at Bonnie   s. They couldn   t keep  enough dresses so they could all go to the ball he was going to throw, or  somebody was. He came in    57, and he gave Oliver a gold medallion  this big around that you wore on your chest, and it had a sash that you  put it on with the Ethiopian flag colors. It was just absolutely  magnificent, and he gave this to Oliver, beautiful case, metal case with  leather over the top of it and everything. Oliver put it in the lockbox, and  it was in the lockbox for twenty years because it was so valuable.  When he died, I had to get three guys   I got the lawyer, myself, and one  of the guys, Murphy, that was here today. They had to witness what was  in the lockbox. The first thing we came to was that medallion of Haile  Selassie   s, and I thought,    God, I   m going to have to eat that    because  Oliver gave a third to the university, a third to the church, and a third to  me. So I was going to have to eat whatever. They wanted cash,  obviously, and I figured,    Well, that   s interesting.    So we took it to the  jeweler   s downtown, and when it came back, scratched on the back of it  was    NV,    of no value. It was pewter with gold paint, and I said,    I still  want to know what that gold paint was,    because it didn   t tarnish a bit   (Laughs) I don   t know why that just tickled me to death. I was just   it  was just a very interesting sort of deal, but that doesn   t make Ethiopia  any more or less.  Your dad was involved with the  Point Four  project during his     Oh, yes, he went over there at least four times, developing the  university. He didn   t stay over there, but he was over there four different  times. From what I understand, the architecture is Williamsburg, just  like here. My last graduate student was Ethiopian. He can   t go home  because he belongs to the wrong tribe. He happened to go over as a  tourist about three or four months ago and went to Addis  Ababa  to see  the university because he taught there before he came over here. We got  him a job at Pioneer, but he   s a man without a country, and it just brings  you to tears to see that sort of thing.  Ever since the beginning of that program, there have been so many  strong ties between here and there that still seem to continue.  Oh, yes, yes. I don   t think you could stop them.  28  Larson  Willham  Larson  Willham  Larson  Willham  Larson  Willham  Larson  Willham  Larson  Willham  Larson  Everybody that we   ve talked to as part of that interviewing program just  had the most amazing recollections of their time there.  Yes, yes.  They just loved it. They all thought they learned a lot, and it impressed  all of them immensely.  Yes, it would. I didn   t realize that Addis was seven thousand feet  elevation. That   s high. That   s Estes Park height, compared to 850 here.  (Laughs)  Quite a difference.  Yes.  Anything else that we missed that you want to discuss?  I think we   re doing fine.  Well, thank you so much.  You   re welcome.  I do appreciate it.  Yes, it   s been fun.  We   ll be following up with you, but thank you so much for your time.  -------  -------
