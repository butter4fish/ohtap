Speaker 1: And I'd like to have you--I ask five questions of everyone; they're a little People magazine-ish.  I'd like to know what your favorite food is.
Speaker 2: Food.  I love food; don't eat red meat, try to stay away from shell fish, but everything else is fair game.
Speaker 1: Your favorite time of year?
Speaker 2: I love all four seasons.  I grew up in the Midwest, so I have a profound appreciation for the changing of the seasons.
Speaker 1: Your favorite place to vacation?
Speaker 2: At home.  I have to travel so much that when I'm at home, it's like a vacation to me.  And we live on the water, and I fish, and I garden and take care of my flowers.  So my favorite vacation spot is my home.
Speaker 1: And your favorite color?
Speaker 2: Orange.  I love earth tones.  I love golds and oranges and reds and yellows, the colors of nature.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: My favorite phrase is a statement that Sir Winston Churchill made to his troops when they were losing the war [World War II, WWII].  And his commanding generals were--are saying to him, "We're doing our very best." And he said, "It is not enough to do your best.  You must do what is required of the situation."  And so I've pretty much lived my life by that.  I tell my staff all of the time and my son [HistoryMaker Alfred Liggins, III], as he was growing up, 'cause he's like, "I'm trying, Mom.  I only got a C, but I'm doing my best."  I'm like, "Well, your best isn't good enough.  You must do what is required of the situation."
Story_ID: 317896
Speaker 1: Now, let's start out by talking about your father.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: If you could give his name and also talk about what you know about his background and his growing up?
Speaker 2: My father's name was William Alfred Woods.  My son's name is Alfred [HistoryMaker Alfred Liggins, III], after his grandfather.  My father was one of eight children, born to a maid [Fannie Woods] and a chauffeur [Edgar Woods] in Chattanooga, Tennessee.  And my father was the black sheep of the family.  He worked for a bootlegger whose front was black funeral parlors.  And instead of having bodies in the coffins, they had bootleg liquor because this is during the days of Prohibition.  And my mother [HistoryMaker Helen Jones Woods] thought that my father--at that time, black society, the ultimate in terms of black entrepreneurism were black undertakers.  And so my mother thought that she was marrying very well by marrying my father.  She thought his family owned a chain of funeral parlors, when, in fact, they were bootleggers.  And he had dropped out of high school because he was making so much money which gave him the freedom to literally follow my mother, who was a professional musician, all around the world.
Story_ID: 317897
Speaker 1: All right, Julieanna [Julieanna Richardson], where was I?
Speaker 2: So we were talking about your--
Speaker 1: My daddy [William A. Woods].
Speaker 2: Yes, your daddy.  And I would like to ask on camera, what, who did he work for?
Speaker 1: He worked for a gentleman by the name of Harry Brown who had a nightclub years ago called the Brown Derby.  And my father was a high school dropout, and once he married my mother [HistoryMaker Helen Jones Woods], my mother used her savings from being a professional musician to put him through school.  Back then, they didn't have GEDs [General Educational Development].  If you dropped out of high school, you went back at night, to night school and got your high school diploma.  There was no shortcut back then.  So she made him go to night school and get his high school diploma.  And she said that she figured that since he was going to school, that he might as well go to college.  And so he enrolled in Creighton University [Omaha, Nebraska].  He became the first African American to graduate from Creighton University which is a Jesuit institution.  It's the sister institution to Georgetown University [Washington, D.C.] which is also owned and operated by the Jesuit order of the Catholic priests.  And he graduated from Creighton University as their first accountant.  Quite a tragic story.  Three years after graduation, the best job that he could get was the midnight to eight A.M. shift at Skinner Macaroni [Skinner Macaroni Company, Omaha, Nebraska], bagging pasta at night.  No one would hire or trust an African American accountant.  After the third year, the Jesuit priests were very embarrassed.  Here they've produced their first African American accountant and no one will hire him.  And so they went to the Internal Revenue [Internal Revenue Service (IRS)]--Creighton University is quite influential, was then, still is, in Omaha, Nebraska, and insisted--one of their graduates was in charge of the bureau at that time.  They hired my father as the first IRS agent, black agent, in the history of the Midwestern office.  However, they sent him out state and out-state Nebraska is not appreciably different than out-state Mississippi.  And one of his clients, three, four months into his tenure with the Internal Revenue Service was one of those Wild West bars.  And the owner took offense at a black Internal Revenue agent coming in--they carried guns.  My father had a badge and a gun.  He took my father's gun and pistol whipped him within inches of his life.  And my father almost died.  When he recovered, he took all the knowledge that he had acquired at the Internal Revenue Service and went in business for himself.  And we specialized in representing African American businesses.  And it was quite interesting because just that brief time that he worked for the Internal Revenue, established a track record and gave him the credentials that then made black businesses feel comfortable with him.  So we had the black cab company.  We had the black funeral parlor.  We had the black restaurant, which was really called a cafe and then hadn't grown up to be a restaurant in Omaha yet.  We had the one black doctor, the one black lawyer.  My daddy was the one black accountant.  But we had quite a successful accounting practice in Omaha, Nebraska.  My father died at forty-five.  And it was so tragic because he was just starting to come into his own.
Story_ID: 317898
Speaker 1: We had opened an office in Chicago [Illinois] where we were representing Reverend Clarence Cobb and the First Church of Deliverance [Chicago, Illinois] and his famous, world-famous Sunday evening broadcast.  And when we took over, Reverend Cobb and the members of First Church of Deliverance were really just taking the receipts and stuffing 'em into mail bags.  Back then, mail bags used to be big, old ugly gray, dirty things.  And they would just stuff the money in.  And my father [William A. Woods] was like, "No, no, no, no, no.  You need to have the Brink's [The Brink's Company] truck." Because that's how much money the good people of Chicago were throwing up on that altar on Sunday night.  And so we established a system for the First Church of Deliverance.  And a lot of people aren't real--don't realize that Reverend Clarence Cobb was very much in the same vein as Daddy Grace [Marcelino Manuel da Graca] and Father Divine, only he never looked for anything back.  When we took over the books for Church--First Church of Deliverance, one of our first responsibilities was to inventory the assets of the church.  Reverend Cobb had apartment buildings all over the United States that belonged to the First Church of Deliverance, that people had lived in 20, 30, 40 years, never paid a penny's rent, all over the United States.  He would buy buildings, move black folks into them and then, like forget about them.  And it was such an interesting thing because most people didn't realize how many people, throughout the United States--he had one of the first national churches and national movements.  The parishioners would take care of the churches themselves.  They never called the church to have the new furnace put in the building because they weren't paying rent.  They were doing all this themselves.  We found tens and tens of millions of dollars' worth of property.  And because we had done such a good job of really helping to establish the books and the accounting service for the First Church of Deliverance and Reverend Clarence Cobb, Gladys [Gladys Holcomb], of Gladys's Restaurant [Gladys' Luncheonette, Chicago, Illinois] then hired us.  She was one of our big clients because at that time, there was a line 24/7 to get in Gladys' in Chicago.  And then all of a sudden, the Honorable Elijah Muhammad and the Nation of Islam became our client.  And then shortly thereafter, the federal government gave the P-Stone Rangers [Blackstone Rangers; Black P. Stone Nation] a contract.  We were the accounting firm that that contract went through.  And so we were building quite a practice in Chicago.  We had the Hyde Park Association [Southwest Hyde Park Association, Chicago, Illinois] and E. Duke McNeil was one of our clients.  And we were doing just great.  And because of our relationship with the Nation of Islam, Muhammad Ali became a client because by then he was quite active in the Nation and particularly close to the Honorable Elijah Muhammad.  And John Ali was the business manager for the Nation of Islam.  And so we start handling the fight business.  And as things were just finally breaking through for my father, after all these years of struggle, he's finally being recognized as this great CPA [certified public accountant].  He's finally having so much business that we're having to hire a staff, he dies of a heart attack at forty-five years old.  And we were devastated.
Story_ID: 317899
Speaker 1: One of the reasons that I ended up ultimately moving to Washington, D.C. was because his [Hughes' father, William A. Woods] dear friend, John Jenkins, was then in charge of a program for the government called OMBE.  And OMBE was the Office of Minority Business Enterprise.  It was an idea that Congressman Parren Mitchell [HistoryMaker Parren J. Mitchell, III] had sold to President Richard Nixon [President Richard Milhous Nixon].  Now, I take a lot of grief when I say this, but I'll say it to the day I die.  Under Richard Nixon's administration, African Americans made more economic progress than we have under all the rest of the presidents combined.  And black folks don't wanna hear that.  But Richard Nixon's theory was, and philosophy was, "Let me make some black folks financially successful, and let them take care of the rest of the black folks, and I don't have to be bothered anymore, and neither does the Republican Party."  And so, so many innovative, progressive programs that Parren Mitchell, who was really an entrepreneurial genius.  If he had not been a politician, he probably would have been our first black billionaire.  Parren Mitchell is busy masterminding these programs, taking them to Richard Nixon.  They're passing them through [U.S.] Congress, and there's all this money being made available for African American entrepreneurs and ventures.  Well, so many of them were failing, because they did not know how to set up books.  They didn't know that they had to pay their taxes.  They did not realize that if you get in tax problems, there's no bank--you can't get yourself out.  You have to pay your taxes.  We were experts on this 'cause remember, we come out of the Internal Revenue [Internal Revenue Service (IRS)] (laughter).  And so the first thing we do is go into a black business and make certain that their taxes are, boom.  Two things that have kept me in business all these years: my taxes are always current, and my employees always get paid; never had a check bounce on any of my employees or the government.  I may have to do without the rent and the lights and the rest, but the taxes and the staff get paid.  And so we taught black businesses this.  So John Jenkins, who had grown up with my father in Chattanooga, Tennessee, was now in charge of OMBE, the Office of Minority Business Enterprise.  He says to my father, "Open an office in D.C.  Everybody we give a grant to, we're going to require them to hire your company to set up their books so that they will not go out of business not knowing that they have to pay their taxes, not knowing that you have to make the payments on your loans, not knowing the things--," so many African Americans at this time were so hard working, so smart, so creative, so ingenious, but had no business experience, didn't know how to keep the books, didn't know what was needed.  And so that was gonna be our big contract.  But dad died before we could, in fact, do it.  So I had an opportunity to move to D.C.  And so I did, and it was kind of like in his memory, because I was just so, so, so--we were all just so distressed in the family.  And so I came, and I went to Mr. Jenkins' office.  And he was like, "Well, I can get you a government job."  And I was there towards the end of the day.  And when that day ended, I had never seen a human stampede before.  But thousands of government employees were stampeding out that front door, and me, being from little Omaha, Nebraska, where the tallest building was about eight stories tall, I panicked.  I was like, "I can't work in the government."  I had never seen such a mass exodus of human flesh in my life.  I was intimidated.  I was terrified.  I was like, no way can I work in the government.  So that was the end of my opportunity to get a good government job.  But thank God that that stampede frightened me.  Maybe the Lord scheduled it for that day so that I would ultimately end up in the field of communications.  But it was my father that made me want to move to D.C.
Speaker 2: When he had those clients, when things were going well, what period of time was that?
Speaker 1: I'm terrible on dates.
Speaker 2: Okay, do you that was the early '60s [1960s]?
Speaker 1: Well, Alfred [Hughes' son, HistoryMaker Alfred Liggins, III] is forty years old.  And he was three, going on four when my father died.  So, we're talking about the '60s [1960s].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: We're talking about the late '60s [1960s].  We're talking about '68 [1968], '69 [1969].  Accounting, I'm pretty good at.  Straight math, I have to use my fingers, even with the calculator, and I'm not good on remembering years, but I'll do the best I can for you.
Story_ID: 317900
Speaker 1: Now, let's talk about your father's [William A. Woods] family because he had an interesting--there's an interesting background with his parents [Fannie Woods and Edgar Woods].
Speaker 2: Absolutely.  His parents were a real-life version of 'Driving Miss Daisy'.  In Chattanooga, Tennessee, his mother was a maid, his father was a chauffeur.  And the thing that--I'm sorry, I got distracted, okay.
Speaker 1: You said his mother was a maid and his father--.
Speaker 2: No, no, no, I remember my point.  I'm sorry.  I thought they were trying to get me.  His mother was a maid.  His father was a chauffeur.  In Chattanooga, Tennessee, as was the case in so many southern towns, the servants lived behind the mansions in what we now know as alleys.  But back then, they had street names.  And my grandparents lived on Blair Alley, Blair Street.  And there was a row of houses that belonged to the servants that worked in the mansions that were in front of them.  So as the matriarch of the Cox [ph.] family--was their name, started to grow old in age and the children had moved away, they wanted to provide for their mother, very much like 'Driving Miss Daisy.'  They wanted to be able to keep her home.  So they come to my grandmother and grandfather with what they think is this great deal, which is, they will give them their house on Blair Alley if they will stay on and keep the house open so that on holidays they can come home to momma and bring the grandchildren and if she wants to go to the doctor or shopping, my grandfather can drive her.  And my grandmother and grandfather looked at the Cox family and said, "Are you crazy?  I mean we don't want the servant's house. Okay, we assumed we were gonna get that."  So they said, "What do you want?"  They said, "We want our eight children to be sent to college."
Story_ID: 317901
Speaker 1: So anyway, the Cox [ph.] family comes to my [paternal] grandmother [Fannie Woods] and my [paternal] grandfather [Edgar Woods] and said to them that they wanna keep the house open.  They want their mother to be able to stay home in the mansion and keep the mansion going until she dies.  They don't wanna put her in a nursing home.  And in exchange for that, they're willing to give them the house on Blair Alley [Chattanooga, Tennessee] where the servants live.  Well, my grandmother and grandfather are like, "The house?  We assumed we were gonna get the house.  We don't want the servants' quarters on the alley to work the rest of our lives taking care of your mother."  And so they said, "Well, what do you want?"  And my grandmother and my grandfather said, "We want you to send all eight of our children to college."  And so the Cox children said, fine.  They made a deal that they would college educate all eight of my grandparents' children.  The interesting thing is that Mrs. Cox lived well into her nineties.  And my grandmother and grandfather were very frustrated because--not that they wished her any ill, but their lives weren't going to begin until she died because my grandfather was really 'Driving Miss Daisy' and Miss Cox, interestingly enough, the reason she wanted to stay home, and she had her bridge club, and she had her flower club.  She went somewhere all the time.  When we would go to visit grandpa and grandma in the summertime, grandpa had to go to work just about every day.  Grandma would tell Miss Cox, "Listen, my grandchildren, my son's coming home with my grandchildren from the North.  I've not seen them.  So you go in the refrigerator and warm up your food, okay" (laughter). But Grandpa was, Grandpa was a lot more loyal in terms of--he was just like Morgan Freeman.  He would go every day, make certain Miss Cox--Grandma was like, I don't know when that broad's gone die (laughter), okay, 'cause she's ninety-seven years old now, you know, (laugher) and I've been working for her for fifty years.  But they made good on their deal.  They educated seven of the eight children.  The eighth child that didn't get the college education, courtesy of the Cox family, was my daddy [William A. Woods], because as I said, my daddy had dropped out of high school.  So it's my mother [HistoryMaker Helen Jones Woods] who actually sent my father through high school and college with her savings.  My oldest, my father's oldest sister, Aunt Jeanette [Jeanette Woods (ph.)], became the first African American principal of a school in Chattanooga, Tennessee.  It was quite an accomplishment for a maid and chauffeur to have eight college-trained children.  And it was only because they were wise enough to strike this deal.  Unfortunately, they died within six months of Miss Cox dying.  What they said was absolutely correct, that she was going to outlive them.  They never did get to enjoy their house.  They never did, because they worked 'til the day that they died.  But on my mother's--grandmother's death bed, she said to my mother, that it was well worth the investment that all of her children had been college educated, because I don't think that my grandmother had been to college, had been to school at all.  And my grandfather had been a third grade dropout.  And so to have college-trained children was an accomplishment for even the undertakers and the Pullman porters and the black bourgeoisie of the day. For a maid, this was like high society in Chattanooga, Tennessee.  And so it was quite a status symbol that, you know--everyone in the community knew the story of my daddy and his family.
Story_ID: 317902
Speaker 1: Did your father [William A. Woods] share any other stories about his growing up?
Speaker 2: Yes, but to be very honest with you, you don't keep up with them.  So much of black--the reason what you're doing is so important, when you're a child, it bores you.  It irritates you.  You don't wanna sit at the dinner table listening to your daddy talk about when he was your age.  You're like, will he please give me a break?  Who's interested in that?  And even back then, because here we are, we all were educated, all four of us.  I'm the oldest of four children.  We were in parochial schools all of our lives, nice little Catholic children.  Back in those days, black folks felt that the way to save your child was to put them in a Catholic school 'cause we grew up in the projects while Dad was going through high school and college.  And so Mom [HistoryMaker Helen Jones Woods] kept us in Catholic schools.  So even the stories about the Brown Derby and dad's quote sporting life days, that wasn't real to us.  We had no frame of reference.  We didn't know anything about that.  So it went in one ear and out the other.  I can't tell you how distressed I am now that I'm approaching sixty, that I don't know my family history because when I share with you the story of my mother's side, both sides of my family have such rich legacies, such rich history, and I can't give you names, dates or places.  And that's tragic, because now, I get on radio, and I get on television, and I do interviews and print media.  And I tell people, document your history.  The reason that I want to be so supportive of The HistoryMakers, this is the most important thing that can possibly happen because other cultures, the reason they have such rich, cultural ties, is because their histories have been documented by them, not by other people telling their stories.  We have an obligation to our future generations to tell our stories.  And that should start with each of us individually.  I now collect black memorabilia.  Can you imagine how many foolish, middle-class, African Americans have gone home to grandma's house and thrown out everything in the attic, not realizing that they were throwing away the history of black people in America?  We didn't know.  And now that we know, we're kind of running to play catch-up, and while I encourage other people, I'm probably the biggest offender because I've had so much rich history in my family that I can't tell you about, because I wasn't paying attention.  I wasn't trying to document it.  I'm busy telling everybody about Frederick Douglass and everyone else's family, when God had blessed me with my own rich history and heritage.
Story_ID: 317903
Speaker 1: Now your mother, can you talk about her and her background?
Speaker 2: My mother's name is [HistoryMaker] Helen Jones Woods.  Helen Elizabeth Jones Woods.  My name is Catherine Elizabeth [HistoryMaker Cathy Hughes].  My mother was the only daughter of Dr. Laurence C. Jones.  Dr. Laurence Clifton Jones was the first African American to receive his Ed.D., which was a forerunner to the Ph.D. from Iowa State University [sic. University of Iowa, Iowa City, Iowa].  He was from Marshalltown, Iowa.  And my grandmother [sic. grandfather], nearly a hundred years ago, founded the Piney Woods Country Life School in Piney Woods, Mississippi, which is a 2,200 acre boarding school.  At one time, there were over sixty boarding schools for African Americans because, again, those black folks that didn't send their children to Catholic schools, sent them to boarding schools because even though the inner city and the ghetto wasn't a hundred years ago what it is today with the drugs, it still was not the best place to rear your child if you, in fact, wanted something better for your children.  And one of the things that Africans living in America have always wanted and we've had this insatiable thirst for, was for each generation to do better, for our children to do better than we did.  And so we had all these black boarding schools.  And they were some of the finest institutions of learning that his country had.  Now, we have four.  And of those four--we're down from sixty-eight, I think was the top number, to four.  And of the four, the Piney Woods Country Life School, founded by my father in 19--grandfather, founded by my grandfather in 1907 [sic. 1909], is the only totally financially secure one of the four.
Story_ID: 319945
Speaker 1: Okay, your mother [HistoryMaker Helen Jones Woods].  So can we talk about--well, we have--talking about her family, yes.
Speaker 2: Yeah, we were just starting.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: All right, my mother is the youngest.  She's the only daughter of Dr. Laurence C. Jones, and what we were talking about at the tape change was how there were a group of African craftsmen who were convinced by the wealthy Americans of the time to come to the United States. Well, they're like, no, heck no.  We're not coming there.  You got slavery.  And they, a deal was struck where these African craftsmen were settled in the Midwest of the United States, places like Iowa and Nebraska and North Dakota and South Dakota and Kansas and Missouri.  And they were skilled craftsmen who not only produced their wares, but were allowed to sell the good, goods that they produced.  And a part of African American history that certainly we aren't proud of is many of them had slaves themselves, because that's what was going on in America at the time.  Slavery existed in both the North and the South, the West and the East.  Slavery was accepted for a period of time in the United States.  And so many of these free Africans who were skilled craftsmen doing--craftsmen doing things like being goldsmiths and silversmiths and working with marble and other things that the wealthy white families of America wanted.  They were never slaves.  They arrived here on private ships.  They were settled in the Midwest, and many of them went on to take advantage of the American economic system and live in isolated communities.  There are stories--I don't know how true they are, that my ancestors were never slaves, that they were, in fact, entrepreneurs.  And that my grandfather was the youngest of seven children.  And he was the only boy.  The six, his six older siblings were all girls.  So I don't have to tell you that he was the star of everybody's eye.  He was the apple of their eye.  They saved their money.  They pooled their resources, and they sent him to college.  And there is a document that exists in our family where it cost them $10,000 the first year for him to go, because the school [University of Iowa, Iowa City, Iowa] didn't wanna take him, naturally.  Can you imagine $10,000 a hundred years ago for someone to go to college?  That was like a million dollars back then, but they did it.  And he graduated from college, and they certainly were expecting and looking forward to him being a superstar, probably founder of black intelligentsia. I'm certain they had these grandiose plans for him.  He had other plans.  His plan was to go and help black folks who had no education.  Something had touched his heart while he was in college, and maybe it was because he had grown up in a privileged existence and had learned about the plight of, at that time, probably 95 percent of other black folks.  And there was no talented tenth, and probably I'm stretching it by thinking there was fifth of the population that had some level of resources and privilege connected with their lives.  So, he gets on a train, right after graduation and travels to Mississippi, of all places, gets off the train and sits on a log under a cedar tree and starts telling black kids--they're like, "Who are you, and what are you doing down here?" 'Cause a northerner in a suit and tie and real shoes.  Everybody else is barefooted and illiterate and barely able--
Story_ID: 319946
Speaker 1: My [maternal] grandfather [Laurence C. Jones] used to always say, I never forgot, that the reason black folks in Mississippi talk so bad and crack verbs is what they used to call it, and couldn't--had no command of the English language was because they talked just like the white folks that they worked for; that everybody in Mississippi at that time--you know, Mississippi was, was, for a long period of time, the poorest state in the United of America.  Everybody was impoverished.  Everybody was backwoods, illiterate and ignorant, for want of a better term.  And so he wanted to change that for African Americans in Mississippi.  It almost got him lynched.  But--and there's a picture that exists in my family of my grandfather on the horse with a rope around his neck.  But my grandfather, being the great orator that he was to the day he died, when he finished explaining to those white folks, how much better their farms were going to be run, because the slaves would be able, the--not slaves, but the workers--because slavery was over by then.  But the workers would be able to count the acres and know how many seeds to put in each plot, how much better their food was gonna taste, because they'd be able to read and write recipes and do correct measurements, how much better their clothes were gonna fit them because they'd be able to take exact measurements.  There was one intelligent, wealthy white man who said, "Stop, stop the lynching, whoa.  This is exactly what we need, not just in the colored community," as it was called at that time.  "We need this for our own white folks."  They took my dad--granddaddy down off the horse, and the wealthy white man became one of his biggest benefactors, gave him a shed, took him out from under that tree.  And it was an old sheep shed.  And my grandfather and my grandmother lived in one side, and they taught school in the other side.  By then, he had married a woman from Iowa, who was also an educator, by the name of Grace [Grace Morris Allen Jones].  And Grace and my grandfather actually built the school together.  Grandma Grace died when my mother [HistoryMaker Helen Jones Woods] wasn't but three.  And so she's pretty much left out of the story of Piney Woods [Piney Woods Country Life School, Piney Woods, Mississippi], but she was there during those early, critical days.  It was her idea of how they could support--this lynching kind of opened their eyes to a lot of things such as, there were a lot of--even though Mississippi was a poor, backward state, any time you have large populations of poverty, impoverished individuals, you also have great wealth.  They go hand-in-hand.  Any time you have great poverty, you have great wealth because the great wealth is created off the exploitation of the impoverished.  And so you had a handful of really wealthy individuals in Mississippi.  And my grandmother came up with the brilliant idea that they should be entertained.  So, she started a choir.  And so, they would raise money going around to the plantations and the mansions in the evenings, singing old Negro spirituals to the rich, white folks, and they would toss out money that she would then bring back to run the school.  And they would come out, and they would do on-site alterations for the wedding parties and even when, excuse me, the war was going on, you have movies and, and books about how the South loves to entertain.  And so we kind of had a traveling, catering, tailoring, seamstress.  They would go to the rich people's houses, and they would cook all the food, get all the wardrobe together, clean the house, set up, and then they'd go to another, in exchange for money.  And so a lot of these houses, even though they were quote, white people of means, they didn't have enough means to have full-time staffs because, again, it was relative to the fact that Mississippi still was a very poor state.  And so it was really my grandmother that came up with all these little, ingenious ideas of how to generate contributions for the perpetuation of the school.
Story_ID: 319947
Speaker 1: She [Hughes' maternal grandmother, Grace Morris Allen Jones] died when my mother [HistoryMaker Helen Jones Woods] was three.  She has--my mother has two older brothers.  And the school had a band that went along with the Cotton Blossom Singers.  That was the name of the singing group.  And the band played, quote ol' Negro spirituals.  Well, because the band was traveling everywhere with the Cotton Blossom Singers, they start getting exposed to other music.  And that other music, at that time, was called swing.  Swing was the forerunner to jazz.  And they would hear all these wonderful songs that were called swing.  And they would come back to campus and want to play them and practice them, and my grandfather [Laurence C. Jones] was like, no.  So he gave them something other than Negro spirituals.  He gave them anthems.  So anthems weren't quite a suitable substitute for the swing that the band wanted to do.  So they expanded their repertoire from just old Negro spirituals to old Negro spirituals and anthems.  And the band director and the band members--'cause band members, creative children are always wanting to do whatever is hip, even if you're in Mississippi, isolated.  So they're like, "No, we wanna do swing."  So one night the band director decides that she's gonna steal the band because that's how good they are.  They practiced every day.  My grandfather was just a stickler behind them being the very best.  When the Cotton Blossom Singers would sing and the Piney Woods School [Piney Woods Country Life School, Piney Woods, Mississippi] band would play, they--a old story, the joke was that white folks' wallets would start jumping around in their back pockets and just hop right up out of their back pockets, and open up and dollar bills would just start going everywhere.  And so, that was what the kids were told.  You have to be that good that you gotta make that white man's wallet jump out of his back pocket 'cause that's how we survive.  And so they were that good.  So late one night, they ran away.  And my mother was fourteen years old.  And she told them that unless they wanted to get busted, they were gonna have to take her with them, because my mother wanted to be a professional musician.  Well, my grandfather had very low regard for musicians and singers unless they were singing spirituals and doing anthems.  He told my mother--and I never will forget, constantly for many years, because he was still telling her this once I was old enough to hear it and remember, that she should have become a prostitute, because at least they got paid.  Musicians didn't get paid.  He felt that being a musician was lower than being a hooker.  And he just disassociated himself from her for many, many, many years.  They were not reconnected from time she was fourteen--and she had me at twenty-five years of age--they were not reconnected until I was seven.  And the only reason they were reconnected was because one of the adult quartets that had grown out of the Cotton Blossom Singers, they had--these four gentlemen had graduated from Piney Woods.  At that time, we had kindergarten through junior, junior college at Piney Woods--they had graduated from junior college and had--were a professional gospel quartet.  They passed through Omaha, Nebraska and came, looked up my mother.  And they got on the telephone.  They called my grandfather, and they said, "You've got to see your granddaughter," and, "She is the reincarnation of you."  And to the day he died, he always felt that his spirit had resided in me.  His nickname for me was Castoria which, as you know, is a laxative.  And he used to say, "Yep, Castoria's gone give 'em the runs.  She gone give 'em a run for their money (laughter).  She gone give 'em a run to be in charge.  She's gone--." That was always--it was so encouraging to me and for me as a child also, because my mother used to say, "Why is he calling you a laxative?" But he would always tell me in private, "You gone give 'em the runs, baby girl.  You gone be okay."  And it would always make me feel so good that my grandfather thought that his spirit, his determination, his progressive vision of who he should be and what he should do for his people, resided in me.

Speaker 1: People often ask me why I'm so community oriented.  I don't know anything different.  I mean here my [maternal] grandfather [Laurence C. Jones] had an opportunity--and still, I mean when my grandfather died, he had about fourteen servants in his, you know, service.  He had a full time, two full-time physicians.  They both worked twelve-hour shifts, twenty-four hours a day, an M.D. was there to make certain that we could prolong, and he could prolong, you know, an additional day, an additional hour, an additional minute at that point.  Ultimately, he was ninety-four years old when he died.  Ultimately, he wasn't deprived economically.  It was just that he used 99 percent of the resources that he was able to accumulate to help other people.  But it provided a very, very comfortable, a very successful lifestyle economically for him also.  His mansion--it's called the Community House, still is in existence in Piney Woods [Mississippi].  And they use it now as the campus museum.  The school [Piney Woods Country Life School, Piney Woods, Mississippi] is 2,200 lush acres.  One night, I'm talking to him on the phone, and he's like, "Castoria [HistoryMaker Cathy Hughes], did you hear that noise?  Something just happened.  I gotta call you back."  He had so much oil on the property that it had just popped through the ground (laughter).  It just exploded while he's on the phone (laughter) with me, all right, just boom.  So they found oil and natural gas on the 2,200 acres.  And the good Lord blessed him abundantly, because, I mean, it wasn't always that he could have fourteen employees at his personal disposal.  It wasn't always that he could afford to have, you know, twenty-four hour medical service.  He spent the greater majority of his life being impoverished himself, and using all of his resources to teach an incredible, tens of thousands of African Americans.  Half of Chicago [Illinois]; William Dawson [William L. Dawson] was a graduate of Piney Woods [sic.].
Story_ID: 319949
Speaker 1: Can you tell me about the, the wealthy man?  Do you know who that was who helped your--you know, your [maternal] grandfather [Laurence C. Jones] was teaching under a tree, and he--who was the wealthy--?
Speaker 2: Yes, I know his name, and it'll come to me in a minute.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But where my grandfather really got his true wealth for the school was---my grandfather's favorite show was, 'This Is Your Life' with Ralph Edwards.  And so he's in California, and his staff gives him tickets to go to 'This Is Your Life.'  And Ralph Edwards is walking through (laughter)--Ralph Edwards is walking through the audience like he does, and he stops at my grandfather and says, "This Is Your Life, Dr. Laurence C. Jones."  Well, my grandfather almost fainted because my grandfather had felt that the only thing lower than musicians was the press.  My grandfather felt that the only way for him to survive was to stay off everybody's radar screen.  And he had more paranoia than Mel Gibson in 'Conspiracy Theory' as it related to publicity.  That's the reason so many people don't know the story of Piney Woods [Piney Woods Country Life School, Piney Woods, Mississippi] and the International Sweethearts of Rhythm, which was the name of my mother's [HistoryMaker Helen Jones Woods] band, because my grandfather was just adamant about no publicity, no press coverage.  We control who we interact with.  So they do this, 'This Is Your Life' story, and my grandfather is acting--this is in the '50s [1950s], first African American ever on 'This Is Your Life,' first African American Ralph Edwards had allowed on this show.  And at this time, 'This Is Your Life' is the number one show in America on Sunday nights.  But my grandfather is looking all around, and he's all distracted, and it's his paranoia.  And people are thinking he's getting old and senile.  Ralph Edwards is thinking this.  So Ralph Edwards says, "Well, we can tell that Dr. Jones is getting up in the years," at the end of the show.  And Ralph Edwards starts to cry.  And he says, "I just want to know if there're one million of my viewers who will reach in their pocket and take a dollar bill out, because this man's dream can't die with him."  He's like thinking my grand--my granddaddy lived for another forty-five, fifty years after the show.  And I just need for you to mail in one dollar.  My grandfather's still looking around.  My grandfather is looking around, 'cause he is that upset, okay, he is that paranoid about being on this show.  He's like how can I steal this tape, I'm sure is going through his mind.  Long story short.  So many viewers sent in, not only one dollar but five and tens and twenties and checks for hundreds.  They had to close every bank in Jackson, Mississippi.  They have these photographs of bags of money stacked from the floor to the ceiling in all the banks in Jackson, Mississippi.  They have over a dozen individuals that were caught, prosecuted and sent to jail for stealing tens of thousands of dollars because everybody in the United States knew the money was coming cash in these envelopes.  So railway employees, postal employees, bank employees, they were just taking envelopes and stuffing 'em in their pocket.  Well, even at that, grandpa, still, when the smoke cleared had like $7 million cash, which back in the 1950s was an astronomical amount of money.  Ralph Edwards used to laugh and, years later 'cause then he started coming to Piney Woods regularly.  And, "Your grandfather really set me up.  He really fooled me.  I thought he was about to die on that show."  But what it was, was his paranoia.  He fired the person who arranged for him to be on 'This Is Your Life,' and it was only through the goodwill and insistence of Ralph Edwards and the staff and the family that she was hired back.  It was one of his secretaries who knew he would be in California, a speaking engagement, thought that this would please him so much.  So she had arranged--he was that upset about, "The IRS [Internal Revenue Service] is gonna come get me."  The White Citizens' Council is what the Klan [Ku Klux Klan, KKK] was called back then. "The White Citizens' Council is gonna burn me down.  This is the worst thing that ever could have happened to me."  And years later, when he was in his eighties and nineties, I used to say to him, "Grandpa, how can you say that?"  I mean, the school at one time had $250 million in the bank because seven [$7 million] back then was a real seven (laughter), all right.  It was, it was before inflation and all that.  And he was like, "If I had it to do over, no, I wouldn't have been on Ralph Edwards," and blah, blah, blah.
Story_ID: 319950
Speaker 1: Years later, [HistoryMaker] John H. Johnson is probably who I look up to more so than anyone else.  I love Mr. Johnson.  I love his daughter, Linda [HistoryMaker Linda Johnson Rice].  And so Mr. Johnson--one of my success stories that I like to tell is I can get John H. Johnson to return my call within a couple of hours unless he's not feeling good that day.  And Mr. Johnson's always made me feel good too 'cause he'll introduce me, "This is [HistoryMaker] Cathy Hughes.  She's somebody whose calls I return."  And so, I feel I have a close relationship with him, needless to say.  So we're sitting at a podium.  He's the guest speaker at this awards program.  And we're just making chatter, and I say to him, "Mr. Johnson, all these years, I realize you've never done anything all these years on my [maternal] grandfather [Laurence C. Jones] in Ebony or Jet.  Why is that?"  And he said, "Who is your grandfather?"  And I said, "Dr. Laurence C. Jones."  Well, he just went off.  He starts to tell me the story, that the only time in the history of Johnson Publishing [Johnson Publishing Company, Chicago, Illinois] that they ever missed a deadline was when he found out about my grandfather.  He thought it was the most interesting story that he had ever heard.  And at that time, he felt that my grandfather was the richest black man in America, and that's what the cover story, the headline read, "Richest Black Man in America," with a picture of my grandfather.  And he said, he doesn't know why my grandfather agreed to do it, because very much during the interview, my grandfather made it clear that he couldn't stand the press.  And so, which is interesting, a little sidebar.  I have more sidebars than an O.J. Simpson trial.  So let me just give you another sidebar.  My mother [HistoryMaker Helen Jones Woods] becomes a musician which he had no respect for.  And I'm a member of the press (laughter), which he had no respect for.  So I don't know that Grandpa would be that pleased with how my life came out.  But anyway, during the interview with Johnson Publishing, Grandpa makes it clear to Mr. Johnson and his staff that he doesn't have any regard for the press, and he's leery of them and paranoid about them.  So he said, he doesn't know why he agreed, because he knew what the cover was going to say.  Two weeks before the magazine was supposed to hit the newsstand for the first time in the history of Ebony magazine and Jet, they're slapped with a court injunction by what Mr. Johnson described as, one of them big, highfaluting, New York [New York], Jewish law firms, quote, unquote.  And they couldn't release, they couldn't release the magazine.  And my grandfather and his law firm forced them to change that cover.  And in the timeframe that it took to change the cover, they missed their ship deadline.  And so Mr. Johnson is like, just getting revved up telling this story.  He's just going on and on and on.  They had introduced him.  They're standing at the podium, "And now we have John H. Johnson." Mr. Johnson ain't heard nothing (laughter), okay.  He's steadily dogging my grandpa, okay.  He's like, "If I could a killed your grandfather--."  Like, "Excuse me, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Johnson (laughter), you're supposed to be giving a speech."  Okay, when he got up there, he had to apologize to the audience.  He said, "Whew, my good friend, Cathy Hughes, I hope we're still friends after today's luncheon, just shared some information about her ancestry with me that I have to apologize."  He couldn't get himself together.  Afterwards, I was like, have I made a big mistake?  Only time I've ever felt apologetic about who my grandfather really was--but that's how upset and paranoid he is, was about the media.  He did not trust the media.  He didn't trust politicians.  He lived by a certain set of traditional, old-fashioned rules that served him and the school very well.  As I said, they're financially secure and almost a hundred years old now.  And that's the tree that my mother comes from.
Story_ID: 319951
Speaker 1: Now, talk--put your [maternal] grandfather [Laurence C. Jones] in historical context.  He was a contemporary of (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Booker T. Washington.  One of the stories I grew up as a child--with as a child, was my grandfather went to Booker T.'s funeral.  And he came back home just raising sand about, "There were so many Mrs. Booker T. Washingtons at that funeral that the whole front row was full of mourning sisters, all of whom, all they were in grief, and they were mourning the death of Booker T. Washington, and Booker should a been ashamed of himself, not straightening out his life."  I grew up with fourteen aunts, all of whom thought they were Mrs. Dr. Laurence C. Jones.  My grandfather never remarried.  At his funeral, it was not only them, it was their daughters all (laughter) okay--it was a whole--that, that was the, the standard of the day, different than today when they are called by other terms.  But my grandfather, as I said, my grandmother [Grace Morris Allen Jones] was the first, but there was a whole bevy of beauties, all of whom were referred to as Sister Nellie, Aunt Bert [ph.], Sister Eula [Eula Kelly]--the list goes on and on, Dr. Chandler [ph.].  These women never married, and dedicated their entire life to helping my grandfather build and run his school [Piney Woods Country Life School, Piney Woods, Mississippi].  And when he died, it was so interesting because by then, I'm fully grown, and I really realized the impact of these incredible, strong, beautiful, brilliant, African American women, literally putting their life, their lives on hold so that this brother, who they recognized as being smart, hardworking and pure of heart, in helping other people--because certainly he was not pure of heart in his relationship with all of them, because they all co-existed at the school.  Now, each of them, each had their own house, as I was growing up, 'cause I would go sometime to Sister Nellie's house for dinner, or I'd go to Aunt Bert's (laughter) cottage, okay, for dessert, all right, or Grandpa would say--sometimes after dinner--every evening, dinner was a big, formal affair.  And after dinner, I would be like a messenger service.  He'd send a note here, he'd send a note there.  I'd have to pick up this, I'd have to pick up--and sometimes I had to hit four or five cottages.  But, and they all came to dinner.  They all came to dinner, and I would sit right next to Grandpa and just about every evening, we would have special guests, and one special guest that I would like to tell you about was Ross Barnett, who was the governor of the State of Mississippi.  So one day, I'm watching a videotape that is being circulated in the schools.  It was sixteen millimeter.  I never will forget.  And I'm reading this literature.  And in this literature is Ross Barnett's position on Nigras [Negroes] being allowed to sit next to your daughters in the classroom.  And God forbid that Negroes would be allowed to have equal rights in Mississippi and integrate the schools and live in your neighborhood and under no circumstances would this take place.  And it would be over his dead body.  So Uncle Ross is at dinner that evening, and I say to Uncle Ross, "Uncle Ross, you come here every week and have dinner with Grandpa and us.  You hate Negroes?"  So my grandfather corrects me and says, "Castoria [HistoryMaker Cathy Hughes], that's not a proper question for Governor Barnett." And I'm just, you know, I was then the way I am now.  I was insisting.  I wanted some information, okay.  I had seen this sixteen millimeter piece that they were circulating through the State of Mississippi saying that Nigras would be kept in their place and yet, this wasn't the Uncle Ross that I knew that would always--'cause he knew it would please Grandpa, he always gave me a nickel and bounced me on his knee and everything.  I had no idea that he's the great segregationist that he is.  So when he left, my grandfather explained to me that politicians were all whores, and that Ross Barnett said what he said because that's what pleased white folks, and that the only reason that he came to our dinner table was because the amount of money that Ralph Edwards had made possible for the banks of Jackson [Mississippi] to be existing off of.  And Governor Barnett used to say this, "So glad to be dining once again with the richest family in Mississippi."  Again, I'm a kid.  This doesn't make any sense to me.  I don't understand this, all right.  And I certainly had no idea that Ross Barnett was the great segregationist that he was.  But every evening, we would have these big dinner parties with just unbelievable food and then afterwards, the student body would entertain the guests.  They would sing the old Negro spirituals or the band would play.  We would have a formal program, 'cause no TV was allowed.  There was a TV that had a picture screen this big (gesture) and the TV was that big (gesture).  But we had live entertainment every evening.  And my aunts would all retire to their cottages.  They wouldn't stay for the entertainment, and I would send, I guess the notes were where he was gonna visit for the evening (laughter).  And I would run the circuit, and all of this would be done by sundown and--before sundown.  And then when the sun would set, the campus would shut down.
Story_ID: 317911
Speaker 1: So, yes, Grandpa [Hughes' maternal grandfather, Laurence C. Jones] and Booker T. [Booker T. Washington] were contemporaries, and there was quite a movement of African Americans during that time. This--a correspondence to him from Paul Laurence Dunbar.  My grandmother, Grace Jones [Grace Morris Allen Jones], was--a lot of people don't realize that part--Paul Laurence Dunbar's wife, Alice [Alice Dunbar Nelson], was more accomplished and more prolific a writer than he.  She founded newspapers.  She left him because he felt--she came from a black, middle-class family of means.  And he felt that she should put her writing ability and her whole life on hold to help him.  And he was basically a mama's boy.  And Paul Laurence Dunbar primarily supported himself and Alice, based on the generosity of wealthy white people.  Back then, he wasn't making money writing.  He was basically living off contributions.  And she's like, that's not for me.  She established a women's empowerment organization.  And my grandmother, Grace, headed the Mississippi chapter.  And we have correspondence between her and the Dunbars, so many individuals.  But back then, it was quite customary for--it was very African too, because the African tradition--we don't understand it a lot in Western society, because we view it as polygamy.  It's really not polygamy in its truest sense.  It's really the African man being responsible for the women in the village that do not have means to take care of themselves.  In exchange for that, they build his kingdom.  And so many great African American men practiced that tradition, not realizing it was an African tradition.  And my grandfather and Booker T. and several other of their contemporaries practiced it.  And these women really, brilliant, beautiful women, put their lives on hold for the fulfillment of these great black men's dreams and aspirations.  A contemporary example, not with the, the, you know, the numbers, but Coretta Scott King would have been an accomplished, classical musician, vocalist, but she put all of that on hold in order to be of assistance to Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] and his Civil Rights Movement and sacrificed everything, including the money.  I mean, it's so interesting.  [HistoryMaker] Harry Belafonte was who was paying their bills.  They had no money.  He wasn't bringing in any money.  Coretta would have been done much better economically, but she put her dreams and her vision and her life on hold to help Dr. Martin Luther King.  Dr. Betty Shabazz, major investments, Inner City Broadcasting [Inner City Broadcasting Corporation], the owner of--owners of WBLS [WBLS Radio] and LIB [WLIB Radio] in New York [New York] and several other radio stations.  She was the second largest stockholder to Percy Sutton.  She would have been just fine had she not married Malcolm [Malcolm X].  But, again, she put her dreams, her vision--so it's, it exists in contemporary society in a different version.  But it's very much an African tradition where the king is able to attract women and other individuals who put their priorities on hold for a larger, more important, humanitarian vision that, that is more important; what's better for the overall good of the community of the village, than what your individual wants and desires are.  And that's very much what my grandfather lived by.  That was the dictate of his life, and I just wanted to kind of stick that in there so it just didn't appear that he was just a playboy for the purpose of the, this--the community that he assembled around him.  It was a humanitarian community for the purpose of educating African Americans.
Story_ID: 317912
Speaker 1: Can you talk a little bit about Piney Woods [Piney Woods Country Life School, Piney Woods, Mississippi] and its legacy, you know, the roll that it has played in the black community?
Speaker 2: Oh, Piney Woods still is in existence.  Our placement rate is 96-97, 98-99 percent college placement.  We put in a very active ROTC [Reserve Officers' Training Corps] program a few years back so those percentages that we slipped are young people who decide to go into the [U.S.] military.  It's changed and it's changed very, very significantly.  At one time, it was for underprivileged children.  And the definition of underprivileged children has changed so, so drastically, because now an underprivileged black child isn't necessarily economically deprived.  Their daddy and mama could very well be drug dealers, and they could have a pair of $5,000 diamond studs in their ears, but nobody cooks 'em breakfast, nobody asks them are they doing their homework, nobody gives a darn whether they come home for two, three days at a time.  So they are quote, still underprivileged, but it's not an economic deprivation that we're addressing now which really changes how we have to deal with our student body.  Also, we believe in corporal punishment, and that's a very unpopular position.  Oprah Winfrey had been a big supporter.  She's from Mississippi originally.  And she had just fallen in love with the school, but when she found out that we paddle our students--let me be very clear--I'm the only family member that's ever served on the board of trustees, other than my [maternal] grandfather [Laurence C. Jones].  We monitor this very closely, because we know this is a very unpopular position.  But this is our position.  We usually are the last resort for so many of these young children.  So, is it better for us to snatch up in their behind and straighten them out, because sometimes punishment doesn't work, and sometimes they do very mean-spirited things to other students, or we can't break their stealing pattern.  So do we return them home, as was the case in a child from Chicago [Illinois] who was returned home, and six months later was dead?  Or do we make certain that they understand that we will lay hands on them and keep them in that school, because they've already been expelled from life.  So when we expel them from Piney Woods, we feel, it's like a death sentence.  So we monitor almost hourly.  Anytime we have to lay hands on anybody, it's a big meeting of all the trustees and all of the administrators.  It's not just, you just don't have the right as a faculty member to grab a child and whip their behinds.  But we do believe in the laying of hands on our children, because we feel that the last resort has to be to return them to their home, because the reason they're with us in the first place is because the home is not a safe and nurturing environment for them.  The other thing is, a lot of us are old fashioned.  If my mama [HistoryMaker Helen Jones Woods] hadn't laid hands on me, I wouldn't be sitting here doing this interview today.  And some of the hands that my mama laid on me in contemporary time, she would have gone to jail (laughter), 'cause my mother used to think that until the switch gave you a whelp [ph.], that she hadn't applied it.  And she used to think she was Zorro.  You could hear it cutting the air (sound), (laughter), you know, and that was the tradition in the black family.  I mean, most folks my age can tell stories that their mamas laid hands on them.  Now, young people will pick up the phone and call 9-11 and, you know, the other day, I was in a store.  And a mama was disciplining her child, and the manager of the store came and threatened her with, "I'll call the authorities," 'cause she had snatched the child.  Well, the child went off and had a temper tantrum.  And the mama was very cool.  She cooled out the manager and everything.  And when she got out to her car, I followed her, and I said, "You're doing the right thing, mama."  And she said, "You ain't got to worry."  She got that kid in the car, and she said, "Now, I'm gonna kill you when you get home."  The child stopped crying, stopped having the temper tantrum, okay.  That child will be just okay, because you could tell, the mama was not abusive.  She was straightening the child, and children, babies by nature like to just have their way.  And so I think that a lot of what has happened in society now is that, yes, there are some parents that are abusive, and they should not be allowed to lay hands on children.  But I think the part of what is deteriorating in our society is, our young people don't have a fear of God, and don't have a fear of parents.  And when you don't have those two fear factors in your life, and you figure, I can do whatever the hell I feel like doing, and nothing's gonna happen to me.  I mean so many of us, I mean I grew up in a generation where we said, if we got in trouble, just arrest us.  Do not call home (laughter).  All right, just tell my mama that I disappeared without a trace (laughter), okay.  Let her file a missing person's report.  Do not tell my mama I got in trouble, because the only thing gone keep me safe is lock me up first, if you have to call her, because that's the only thing gone keep me alive, because when she gets down here--and I grew up in the projects where literally, you got beat from one end of the block to the other.  Mamas would stop washing dishes and cooking dinner and come out there and slap you, "Why you do that; embarrassing your mama like that?"  You didn't even know her (laughter), okay.  You didn't even know the woman that was banging you upside your head.  And I mean you'd be so tired by the time you got back to your house and then had to deal with your mother and father disciplining you, and so, what we do at Piney Woods is not totally foreign and alien to me in terms of how I grew up.
Story_ID: 317913
Speaker 1: And I mean I grew up in the projects, and even though now, it's politically correct to call it public housing, it was still terrible back then.  It's always been terrible.  It's poverty that's either stacked high or spread out wide.  And it's a lot of people with lost hopes and lost dreams.  And my mama [HistoryMaker Helen Jones Woods] saw to it and my father [William A. Woods] that we navigated through that system and part of the way was that--not, not my daddy.  My daddy was the peaceful one.  But my mother was a musician.  She had a musician's personality, still does, and temperament.  I like to tell the story about how my mother bought her first leather couch.  And it turned out to be pleather.  And in the projects at night, they turned our heat off at 11:00 P.M. and did not turn it back on until 6:00 A.M. the next morning.  And it would be twenty [degrees] below zero.  And the projects were made out of cinderblock.  So you had all this cement with linoleum in the kitchen and little area rugs, if you were lucky.  But some black folks and white folks, we were just living on cement floors, all right.  We would sleep in our clothes and sometimes we'd actually have to sleep in our boots and shoes and socks in order to stay warm.  So my mother buys what she thought was her first leather couch.  I can see it as vividly today as I could as a kid.  And they turned the heat off, and it cracked.  So my mother called up the store and said, leather can't crack.  It can't split.  I'm not paying you for this.  This isn't real leather.  This is pleather.  So they were like, well, if you don't make your payments, we're gonna repossess the couch.  They came out to repossess the couch, and my mother took her cast iron skillet--and I still have this vision, vividly in my mind of my mama chasing the repo man down the projects with the skillet.  They never came back.  We kept that couch, and my mama put some masking tape on it (laughter), all right, and then took some shoe polish and dyed it the color (laughter), all right.  And almost until I graduated from high school, we had that pleather couch, and my mother would tell everybody, "That's my pleather couch that I turned into leather with my cast iron skillet."

Speaker 1: My mother [HistoryMaker Helen Jones Woods] was a very talented musician.  And my mother is very fair complected.  And my mother and the band, they were young girls.  My mother was the youngest at fourteen, but most of them were only sixteen and seventeen.  They'd run away from Piney Woods Country Life School [Piney Woods, Mississippi].  They go out into the big world of music, and they become the sensation of the entertainment industry.  They were Down Beat band of the year.  All of the great musicians--[HistoryMaker] Quincy Jones loves to tell the story about how Ray Charles said, "Man, I gotta go see the Sweethearts [International Sweethearts of Rhythm]," and Quincy is like, "Who?"  He said, "You not hipped to the Sweethearts of Rhythm?"  I mean they were the ultimate for everyone during their day, eighteen beautiful women.  And through mismanagement, a group of unscrupulous, a series of unscrupulous individuals stole their money, left them penniless.  The band broke up.  It was just pure hell for my mother.  They couldn't stay in hotels.  They had to sleep on the bus.  The white girls in the band had to wear dark makeup and pass for black.  It was just a hellish existence for my mother.  She gets pregnant with me.  I'm on the road.  They have me sleeping in dresser draws in hotels.  They would pull out the drawers and put in baby blankets and pillows and everything, and they would make me--they would put me on the front row in a little homemade bassinet.  And this couple from Omaha, Nebraska, who--their daughter had been one of the band directors who had helped abscond with some of the funds; she died of cancer.  And they kind of adopted me and my mom.  And they said, "The road's no place for little Cathy [HistoryMaker Cathy Hughes].  Leave her here with us."  And so that's how we ended up Omaha, Nebraska.  So, they kept me.  And when they died, they tried to repay their daughter's wrong doings.  They left me all their worldly possessions.  And so, that's how we got established in Omaha.  And so my mother went and applied for and secured a seat with the Omaha Symphony.
Story_ID: 317915
Speaker 1: And she [Hughes' mother, HistoryMaker Helen Jones Woods] was in her third season with the Omaha Symphony and was really feeling good about herself, and her music, and there was a terrible snowstorm.  My father [William A. Woods] was waiting tables at this time at a place called the Omaha Club [Omaha, Nebraska].  Omaha, Nebraska has produced a long list of distinguished individuals, both black and white.  Marlon Brando and his family are from Omaha, Nebraska.  Mrs. Brando [Dodie Brando] ran the Omaha Playhouse [Omaha Community Playhouse, Omaha, Nebraska].  The Fondas, Henry Fonda, Joan Fonda, all--Jane Fonda, I'm sorry, Jane Fonda, Henry, Peter [Peter Fonda], all of them, Omaha, Nebraska.  Warren Buffett, the list goes on and on.  In the black community, Bob Gibson, who won the World Series back when black folks were barely getting baseball contracts, [HistoryMaker] Gale Sayers, the list goes on and on, of distinguished African Americans and white people.  Anyway, this club, the Omaha Club is where my father waited tables.  And so that night the club closed early, because there was this terrible blizzard coming to Omaha.  And my mother was getting back and forth to the symphony on the bus.  And so my father was being let off from work about the same time as mom was getting off.  So he went to the symphony house to pick up my mother.  And it was her third season with the Omaha Symphony.  And so either they thought she was a white woman, married to a black man, or they realized that it was a black woman that they had accidentally hired.  And they fired her the next day.  To this day, my mother has never picked up her horn.  It devastated it.  It changed everything in our lives.  My mother was more--I think it was the culmination of a successful music career that left her penniless.  I think it was the realization that my father, not only wasn't a wealthy son of a funeral parlor owner but was a high school dropout.  I think it was my pregnancy--her pregnancy with me when she wasn't married.  I think it was just a culmination.  Several years ago, Leonard Feather, the great jazz writer and critic put together a reenactment of the International Sweethearts of Rhythm because Marian McPartland has written a book about them as well as Antoinette Handy [D. Antoinette Handy], granddaughter of W.C. Handy.  And at that time, there were nine members of the group still alive.  And they put them in an orchestra of eighteen women and had them each play their individual instruments, and play their music.  My mother stood on stage and tapped her foot.  She refused to touch her horn.  Her horn is still in the attic, in the box.  All of us, all of her children have been in there and pulled it out and everything.  And the only time my mama will really go off on you, if you touch it.  She wants it left in that box to the day she dies.  She has refused to pick it up.

Speaker 1: No musical talent with the four children that she [Hughes' mother, HistoryMaker Helen Jones Woods] gave birth to.  But my niece is a child prodigy.  She was the only African American child to perform for the Queen [Queen Elizabeth II] when she celebrated her anniversary in London, England.  My niece has performed in China.  She has performed in Australia.  Every conservatory in the United States is vying for her--she's a senior in high school now--for her attendance at their school.  And my mother just kind of has dismissed music.  There's been so much pain, so much misery associated with it. And remember what I told you; at a very formative, formative age, my [maternal] grandfather [Laurence C. Jones] said to her that it was lower than being a prostitute.  So, she's had all of this.  So I bring you full circle forward, and when I decided to go into radio, my mother was devastated.  She was terrified.  She petitioned me all the way up to 1999 which was the turning point.  My mother is a unbelievable reader.  She reads everything.  And so when we went public, she starts subscribing to and reading The Wall Street Journal.  So when she starts seeing Wall Street analysts have a favorable opinion of her daughter's business, she changed for the first time in her life and stopped worrying me about getting a good government job.  She was so upset with me that, that day when I saw John Jenkins' stampede coming out of the [U.S.] Department of Commerce, I was like, "Ma, I can't work there.  I just, that's not my personality."  She was like, you know, I mean, right now she thinks I should have Condoleezza's [Condoleezza Rice] job (laughter), all right.  She just really not--never got comfortable with the fact that I didn't come here to get a good government job, because she sees radio as just being a, a offshoot, which it is, of the music industry.  And she has these terrible, terrible, terrible memories of the music industry that--she's in her eighties now.  And all of my brothers and sisters, we all talk about it, and her grandchildren.  We just wish we could get her past that.  And we can't.  She'll take it to her grave because so much of it was so glorious.  As a child, the nuns used to send notes home to my mother saying that Cathy [HistoryMaker Cathy Hughes] has delusions of grandeur and needs counseling, because I would say, "This weekend, Uncle Nat King Cole came to visit us, and he took us shopping, and he bought us all shoes."  And this was when he was on television.  And he would be, you know, maybe performing in Chicago [Illinois] or some place or St. Louis [Missouri], and he would come through Omaha [Nebraska] and visit Mom because Mom had played, you know--and, you know, gigs with him with the Sweethearts of Rhythm [International Sweethearts of Rhythm], you know, had performed with him.  And we were living in the projects and struggling, and he would come and they were good friends to the day he died.  I mean, his brother, Freddy [Freddy Cole] now still calls me his niece.  And I call Freddy Cole, Uncle Freddy.  Years ago, when I was the general manager of WHUR [WHUR Radio, Washington, D.C.], we reopened the historic Howard Theater [Washington, D.C.].  And I'm backstage, and Moms Mabley is sitting on a big speaker, smoking a cigarette, and her--and Redd Foxx is standing there with her smoking.  And I walked past, and she was like, "Excuse me?  What's your name?"  And I said, "Cathy Hughes."  She said, "Is that your maiden name?"  And I said, "No, ma'am."  She said, "What's your maiden name?"  And I said, "Woods."  She said, "What's your mama's name?"  And I said, "Helen."  She said, "Helen Jones."  And I said, "Yes, ma'am."  She said, "I bought you your first baby carriage.  You used to live in a box."  (Laughter) And so I said, "In a box?"  She said, "Get your mama on the phone."  And she and Redd Foxx started telling me these stories about how successful my mother's group was, how Billie Holiday was my mother's half-time entertainment.  Back then, bands did half-time breaks where they changed clothes.  Entertainers actually left the stage, went and changed clothes and came back for the second part of their performance.  And Billie Holiday, Moms Mabley, Redd Foxx, all of them worked for my mother and the International Sweethearts of Rhythm.  And she told me about these drawers that they would make into bassinets and this box that they had, this wooden box that was my bassinet.  And she brought this carriage, this baby cradle and said, "You all better put that baby in a cradle."  And so here, I'm standing backstage as the general manager of WHUR, putting this opening night together, featuring Redd Foxx and Moms Mabley, and she's telling me how she bought me my first baby carriage, 'cause she was tired of me living in a box.  My mouth was hanging open so that I couldn't--I don't even remember the show to this day.  All I remember was that backstage episode.  And so I called my mother, and I said, "Mama, Moms Mabley and Redd Foxx are telling me that they used to be your half-time entertainment with the Sweethearts."  She said, "Put Jackie on the phone."  Well, my baby sister's name is Jackie [Jackie Woods].  I'm like, "Jackie's not here."  She said, "Fool, that's Moms' real name.  Put Jackie on the phone."  And so then I realized that my baby sister is named after Moms Mabley, okay (laughter).  Jackie "Moms" Mabley was her real name.  And when she said, put Jackie on the phone, I'm like, what--I'm just like totally confused.  My mother gave all that up with that one final culmination incident with the Omaha Symphony where they said, "We don't allow Negroes to play in the Omaha Symphony."

Speaker 1: But then, my mother [HistoryMaker Helen Jones Woods] is a survivor.  She could have been the lead singer for Destiny's Child and done the hit 'I'm a Survivor.'  My mother became an LPN [licensed practical nurse].  Then she became an RN [registered nurse], and then she got her master's [degree] in geriatrics.  She said she wanted to know all she could about old folks so that when she became one, she would understand herself.  My mother has always been socially active in the community.  When we were children, young children, living in the projects, with one chicken, and there's six of us in the family, my mother would go to the orphanage every weekend and bring home children, saying that black families don't adopt black children.  And there'd be six of us already on one little chicken.  And then we have four other people to share it with.  And my mother used to take the end of the chicken, the part of the wing that had no meat on it, and give it to me.  And she told me, and I used to complain.  I said, "I don't want any chicken.  I don't wanna eat.  I don't even wanna be in this house.  I hate you, I hate them.  I just hate, hate, hate, hate--."  And my mother used to corner me and throw me up against the wall, and she said, "Until you learn to be a cheerful giver, God will not bless you."  And that has been something that has--sometimes I'll do something for someone or for an organization, and I don't like the outcome.  And I'll come home, and I'll say to Jeff [Jeff Majors], "I'm not being a cheerful giver."  And he's like, "Why are you saying it that way?"  And it's a throwback to when I was a child, when my mother used to just preach that to me, "Until you can give something that's really important to you or that you really want and feel good about it, God's not gonna bless you abundantly."  And that's something that I monitor constantly within myself, and I try to tell other people that when you do something for somebody, when you give somebody something, you're not supposed to expect anything in return, not even a thank you, because what you're doing is really building your scorecard with God.  And God is who, the creator is who is going to repay you.  And that's what being a cheerful giver is all about.  And the more you give and the better you feel about it, and when you really can't afford to give, when it's really a sacrifice--it means nothing for a person of means to write a check, to sponsor a table at a dinner or even to give somebody some money.  What I try to do, and I try to encourage other people to do, is give my time because my time is more valuable than my financial resources.  When you give your time, you're really giving of yourself.  And so many folks have to give money.  They need it as a tax write-off.  Their accountants say, you know, "Okay, (laughter), you need to get rid of a couple hundred thousand for the end of the year or you gone have to give it to Uncle Sam."  And so that's a lesson that I take with me forever, and I thank my mother so for it, because my mother would make us give until it hurt.
Story_ID: 317918
Speaker 1: One Christmas--my mother [HistoryMaker Helen Jones Woods] was big on books and classical records.  I don't know if you remember, but grocery stores used to sell book series.  And they used to sell classical music series.  So that's what I got for Christmas.  And I thought that was the worst Christmas, and I ignored the fact that the four of us got collectively a record player to play these 45s on, that I don't wanna hear anyway.  And I kind of led a revolution, a little mutiny on my mother.  My mother packed up everything under that Christmas tree and took it to the orphanage and dropped it off.  By three o'clock Christmas afternoon, there was nothing in the house, not even dinner.  She took dinner, she took the toys, she took everything out of the house and then started taking down the tree, just humming to herself.  She said, "You all don't appreciate that I try to do my best."  That was last time that I ever led a mutiny in my household against my mother, and it was the last time that I was not grateful for that which someone does for me.  And, you know, I'll get something maybe as a gift.  Sometimes my listeners are so gracious and generous with me, they'll send me something.  And it's really not something that I need or want, but I won't give it away, because that lesson that my mother taught us that Christmas was that when somebody gives you something, it's the motive, it's the reason.  It's not the gift.  It's the action behind the gift.  And you, if you're ungrateful, that's the ultimate in disrespect.  That's like slapping them, because after my mother took down that Christmas tree, she sat down and cried like a baby.  She said, "I did the best I could for you all this Christmas," which we didn't believe.  We thought she did the best she could for herself 'cause we didn't want no book (laughter), and we had classical records (laughter), okay.  But she dismantled that whole--and my father [William A. Woods] was like--we're like, "Daddy, do you see what Mama is doing?"  And, okay, he was like, "You better talk to your mama, 'cause you all really hurt her feelings."  After that we had happy Christmases every year, and if we didn't, we pretended that we did, because Mama didn't play.  My mother originated what is now called tough love.  My mother believed that you taught children the lessons of life by really applying pressure until they got the message.  And then you move on to the next lesson.  And I have to honestly say it was the most effective--and she didn't know.  Remember, I told you.  Her mother [Grace Morris Allen Jones] died at three, and she ran away from home at fourteen.  My mother had no nurturing.  She had no mothering.  She just figured this out on her own, but she is the wisest, most compassionate, loving, wonderful human being, one personality.  The other personality, she should be hired by the [U.S.] military to train the troops (laughter) because the war would be over (laughter), okay.  She would not tolerate, (laughter), okay, terrorists, oh, no, no, no, no.  We're not having any of that today.  It would be over.  As I've gotten older, I can't tell you how my resp- how much my respect and love has grown for her.  But it hasn't always been that way because my mother feels that, she brought you here, she'll take you out if necessary.
Story_ID: 319952
Speaker 1: Now, I wanna start with what your earliest memory is of growing up?
Speaker 2: I can remember about two years old, eighteen months, around in that area, my mother [HistoryMaker Helen Jones Woods] bought me a cowgirl outfit, cowboy boots, a suede skirt, a vest and a hat.  Well, I wasn't walking that good.  And so, it was not dress appropriate for a toddler.  So I'm stumbling and fumbling, and so my mother takes it off of me, and she remembers as well as I do, the worst temper tantrum that I had ever threw, 'cause as I said, my mother is the originator of tough love.  But she was so happy that I loved this outfit so much that she didn't punish me.  She tolerated my tirade.  I can remember screaming and hollering and punching her and "I want it, I want it, I want," I just loved this outfit.  So my mother put the outfit back on me, and she took a photograph that I have to this day.  And you can see the tear stains and the little suede vest has teardrop stains on it, and then she took it off of me, and probably practiced her tough love, but she took a photograph with me on it--in it.  And I was never able to maneuver.  By the time I was walking good enough to wear cowgirl boots, they were too small.  But I still have the boots, and I still have the vest.  I don't know what happened to the skirt and the hat, and I have the picture.  But I remember that tirade.  I remember trying to punch my mother's lights out.  I can remember fighting and screaming and hollering.  And I can remember the feeling that went through my body of her taking something from me that was really important.  Now, part of what I've learned as I've gotten older and my mother also, 'cause as I said, my mother, you know, gave up being a musician and educating everyone else and went and did her own thing for herself.  And did I mention that while she was in college, she ran for senior citizen homecoming queen and won.  And I think she was fifty-eight, fifty-nine years old (laughter), and the kids at the college thought it was a joke.  And they all voted for her, and she won.  And she called me up and said, "I'm the homecoming queen."  She said, "Well, this is a new experience for me."  And the captain of the football team took her to the prom.  But I think that, because we were on the road, I think that at some point, that she--I felt she had deserted me because she left me with the couple in Omaha [Nebraska].  I think that, that this cowgirl outfit might have symbolized to me in my toddler's mind, my mother really loved me.  And then when she took it back, I think that she didn't, I didn't realize, 'cause I was somewhere between--she and I have been trying to figure out, between eighteen months and two years old.  And it's so strange 'cause I can remember this so well.  And over the years, now, I have a strong personality just like Mama, so there've been many exchanges, none where I was ever allowed to pound on her like I was allowed when I was eighteen months old.  But for some reason, that, that rejection--I, I guess I associated my mother with the outfit.  And then so I thought I was losing my mother again, that she was going to leave me.  She was going to desert me because even though the adults in my life didn't think that it was a wholesome, healthy, happy relationship for me to be on the road, I was very happy in the relationship with my mama and the band [International Sweethearts of Rhythm].  I had eighteen mamas, and I was the center of attention, because I was the baby.  And, you know, what Moms Mabley called me living in a box. It was a cute box.  It was all decorated with bows and ribbons, and they loved to play dress-up with me. And, you know, when I've heard African Americans, women, say that when they were young, they fantasized about being white or having, you know, this or that or long flowing hair; never, because here I was surrounded by these beautiful, talented, African American women.  All my aunties and like I said, even before them, with my mother and the band, it was my [maternal] grandfather [Laurence C. Jones] and all these beautiful, African American women.  All I wanted to do was grow up and be a strong, beautiful, smart African American woman--
Story_ID: 319953
Speaker 1: And I've always been so proud of my African heritage and culture, who did good for their community, because, as I was saying, my mother's [HistoryMaker Helen Jones Woods] always been so active in the community.  I was saying earlier that she went to the orphanages.  Well, also, my mother belonged to an organization called the St. Martin de Porres--he was a black saint--Club [St. Martin de Porres Club] in Omaha, Nebraska that was founded by the gentleman [John P. Markoe], the priest, the Jesuit priest that put me through high school [Duchesne Academy of the Sacred Heart, Omaha, Nebraska], that I'll tell you about in a moment.  But anyway, the de Porres Club was picketing and boycotting and marching in the '40s [1940s] and the early '50s [1950s], well before the Civil Rights Movement.  And their big effort in Omaha, Nebraska was to force the bus company to hire streetcar drivers.  Even though it was called the bus company, buses were pretty scarce back then.  They had a few, but there were streetcars, and they had no black drivers.  And so my mother became the symbol because she represented not only the African American community, but also women.  And the St. Martin de Porres Club, the de Porres gave the Omaha bus company so much grief that they finally acquiesced and said, "Fine, we will hire Helen Woods as our first black woman, bus driver."  There was only one small technicality.  My mama didn't know how to drive.  She didn't get a driver's license 'til she was well into her sixties.  My mama's only been driving twenty-some years (laughter).  So, here she mounts--they mount this big demonstration, and they win.  And my mother's not able to accept the job.  Now, someone else did, but it was a guy, so--and it was not a step forward for her gender.  But it was for her race.
Story_ID: 319954
Speaker 1: I was doing protests and picket signs when I first was going to kindergarten and grade school [at St. John's School, Omaha, Nebraska] because my mother [HistoryMaker Helen Jones Woods] would drop a demonstration on you in the blink of an eye.  Social injustice was something that she did not take lightly.  Her obligation--when they called and told her that at age fourteen, I had been arrested.  I was the vice president of the NAACP Youth Council.  And we had integrated a swimming pool in Omaha [Nebraska] where I had been swimming numerous times with my white--I was the only African American student in the school that I went to, Duchesne Academy of the Sacred Heart [Omaha, Nebraska] which is one of the ultimate Catholic, all-girl schools in the country to this day.  Father John Markoe [John P. Markoe], who founded the St. Martin de Porres Club [Omaha, Nebraska] was a classmate at West Point [United State Military Academy, West Point, New York] of Dwight Eisenhower [President Dwight David "Ike" Eisenhower].  And there was a serious incident involving that class at West Point where there was a ballroom brawl and some individuals lost their lives.  And Father Markoe decided he could not be in the [U.S.] military because of that incident.  And so he became a Jesuit priest, but he never stopped having a friendship and contact with his classmates, including Dwight Eisenhower, who ultimately went on to become president of the United States.  And that's who paid my tuition during high school, all through high school, was Dwight Eisenhower.  And that's who Father Markoe got the money from.  And Father Markoe saw to it that myself and other African Americans received the best education in the white institutions of Omaha, Nebraska that money could buy.  And he did it through the financial resources of these individuals.  He and my mother were quite active in trying to correct social injustice in Omaha, Nebraska.  So I'm in high school.  I'm going to this exclusive Catholic high school.  I'm going swimming at this place called Peony Park [Omaha, Nebraska] with my white classmates.  And then all of a sudden, I hear that Negroes weren't allowed to swim.  And my classmates said, "Did you know Negroes aren't allowed here, Cathy [HistoryMaker Cathy Hughes]?"  And I'm like, I was wondering why are, you know, but most of the time, we would go during the weekdays.  So I'm thinking maybe it's not their time, you know, they're coming after school or something.  So anyway, I go back.  I convince the NAACP Youth Council that we'll all go to the park and integrate it.  We go to the park.  The police come.  They arrest us, because they were surprised that my classmates showed up to support us.  So they've got this big mess on their hands, 'cause here are all these wealthy kids from this finishing school that I'm attending.  General LeMay's [General Curtis LeMay] daughter--Omaha is SAC headquarters, Strategic Air Command.  So all these high-ranking generals, all these powerful military people live in Omaha.  And their children, if they are able to get in, go to Duchesne.  Duchesne only had thirty girls in my class.  And they're all--like, not all, but ten, twelve of 'em were out there with us, going to jail.  They called my mother.  "Your daughter has just been arrested in a civil rights demonstration at Peony Park.  We want you to come get her."  My mother said, "Oh, no.  Good.  I'm glad she was arrested.  You all keep her as long as you like because the longer you keep her, the bigger my lawsuit is going to be against you."  And she never showed up down there to bail me out and discouraged other parents, because we were making a statement.  They expected the parents to come down.  So after about six or seven hours, they're like, "We gotta book 'em.  Their parents won't come."  Mama's like, "No, do not go get them."  All right, this was the first time anyone had ever been arrested in Omaha, even though Mom and them had gone through demonstrations.  They were--we were now at the stage where demonstrations were taking place with Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] and other individuals.  And Mom and the group that she was a member of realized that if we could get some press coverage, if we could get some arrests going, that we could get a little further down this integration road than we had traveled before.  And Mom was like, "No, keep her as long as you'd like."  They were like, "No, no, we want you to come down and get your daughter.  She's only fourteen."  And my mom was like, "No."  Said, "She's been arrested.  Don't you understand?" Mom was like, "That's really good."  They're like, "You're glad your daughter was arrested?"  Mom's like, "For this purpose, yes, I'm very proud of my daughter that she was arrested."
Story_ID: 319955
Speaker 1: People ask me why I'm so community oriented, and I ask them, "Why aren't you?" Because that's the type of family I grew up in.  I grew up in a family where you do for others.  I grew up in a family where you stand up for the underdog.  I grew up in a family where you try to right social injustice.  I grew up in a family where you speak your mind.  Now, you might get popped upside your head, but that's life.  In life, sometimes, a lot of times, you stand up for what's right, you get popped upside your head.  And that's the type of household that I grew up.  And I'm like [HistoryMaker] Nikki Giovanni.  I'd never dealt with the lack of economic resources.  I didn't know that the projects weren't cool until I got grown.  We had fun.  We had loving--my mother [HistoryMaker Helen Jones Woods] gave birth to three children after me.  Never once did we ever have to go to a babysitter when my mother went to the hospital to have the babies.  All the neighbors just took care of us.  They came.  They cooked dinner.  They got us up for school the next morning.  Our household ran in the projects just like my mother was there.  My mother--and back then they kept you in the hospital a week when you had a baby.  It wasn't like you had the baby in the morning, and go home in the afternoon, 'cause your insurance doesn't cover the night (laughter).  Back then, they kept you for five days or seven days, and observed the baby, and observed you, never missed a beat.  Come home from school, "Oh, your mom is having your little brother.  You have a new little brother.  We gon' have dinner at six o'clock.  Anything special you kids want?  What's in your mama's freezer?"  They'd come in, cook, clean, keep the house going.  True community spirit, true reality living of the statement that it takes a village.  Even though it was public housing, it was a village, and everybody had a responsibility to look out for the children, to look out for each other.  And when you did something, you just didn't disappoint your mama or your daddy.  You disappointed the whole darn village.

Speaker 1: Now, let me ask you.  I still wanna go back to, to your, you know, early years, and just trace it chronologically.  But what, what--you were living with a family.  And what was the family's name?
Speaker 2: The Middletons [ph.].
Speaker 1: It was the Middletons.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, the Middletons.  They died when I was about four.
Speaker 1: Okay, and then your mother [HistoryMaker Helen Jones Woods] and father [William A. Woods] came.  At what age did you start living with--did they come to Omaha [Nebraska]?
Speaker 2: When I was about three, they got married.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Or about two and a half, three, they got married, and then when the Middletons died is when they moved to Omaha because we had their house which we only had a minute because they had been on some type of aid to senior citizens.  And as is still the case, if you receive any type of state assistance, then if you have any resources when you die, the state gets the first go at them.  And so they came thinking that we had, you know, a home and that we had some resources.  And we didn't, and it was shortly thereafter when Mom found out that Dad needed to go back to high school, not just college.  And so that's how we ended up settling in Omaha, Nebraska.

Speaker 1: Interesting story about living at the Middletons' [ph.]. Mom [HistoryMaker Helen Jones Woods] was visiting me [in Omaha, Nebraska].  And the house was right next door to a church.  And she heard this incredible voice.  The choir was rehearsing in the church, and she heard this incredible voice one evening.  And she went over.  And she discovered a gentleman by the name of Gene McDaniels.  And Gene McDaniels wrote a song that was a major hit, called 'A Hundred Pounds of Clay,' but more importantly, Gene McDaniels went on to become one of the most prolific song writers ever.  Most people do not realize, he's written major hits for just about everybody in the industry.  My mother, sitting on the porch, playing with me, heard the lead vocalist in this church, and assisted him in accomplishing incredible things in the music industry.  She was able to position individuals in the music industry that had significant success and reward.  Never once was she able to do that for herself.  And I think because of her personality, I think because of her commitment to other human beings, I think that my mother was always destined to be a nurse and not a musician.  My mother is eighty-three years old as I do this interview.  And my mother goes and volunteers five days a week at a magnet school that's two blocks from her house.  And she grades all the papers, and this magnet school--it's a grade school, and the children have this incredible relationship with my mother.  And there's been a lot of research done about how effective grandparents and how effective elders are in dealing with young children and shaping their lives.  And over the years, I can't tell yah how many young people my mother has influenced to really do something with their lives because of her volunteering at this school.  She says she does it because it keeps her young.  I think that the children benefit a lot more from it than my mama does, because there're a lot of things that she could do to keep her young like; come help me run my company (laughter).  I got over two thousand young folks there in dire need of an elder that believes in tough love.  But these little grade schoolers, they just--they made her lose weight.  My mother had gained all this weight.  And she came into school one morning, and they said, "Ooh, Ms. Woods is gonna have a baby.  Look at her stomach."  My mother called me up.  She was petrified.  She was like, "I can't believe this.  They think I'm pregnant."  They--she's like, "I'm too old to have a baby."  They're like, "Look at your stomach, look at your stomach."  Guess what?  My mama ain't got no stomach no more (laughter), okay.  And it's just been such a positive influence, and one of the things that she's been encouraging me to get more involved in is this hook-up between senior citizens and young children.  They're finding that it's the most effective of all relationships.  And, you know what?  When you look back at the history of black folks, grandmamas were who were really in charge of our community.  It wasn't mama.  So often mamas had to go and get jobs.  It was grandmamas who also had jobs, but some type of way, knew how to run Ms. Anne's house and their own house at the same time.  And so many of 'em may not have done the best job with their own children, but did spectacular jobs with the grandchildren.  And so this whole, old folks, young folk connection is something that my mother is really encouraging me to get more actively involved in--
Story_ID: 319958
Speaker 1: Okay, so with the Middletons [ph.]--so your parents [HistoryMaker Helen Jones Woods and William A. Woods] come [to Omaha, Nebraska] at age four.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And then did--is that when you move into the projects?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And the housing?  And was there a name to those projects?  Do you remember?
Speaker 2: Well, the first one we moved into--they were called plazas.  And the first one we moved in was called Franklin Plaza.  And it was behind the Finley Ice Company [Finley Coal, Grain & Ice Company], off 24th Street.  And 24th Street is the main thoroughfare for black folks in Omaha, Nebraska.  On Friday and Saturday night in Omaha, there's so little activity for black folks, that what we did was cruising.  Now, it's become the thing of the hip-hop generation.  In fact, in Florida and L.A. [Los Angeles, California], they have signs up, "No cruising after 8:00 P.M.," (laughter), and I was like, boy, that's a throwback to fifty years ago.  But we would just walk up and down the street.  It would be almost like an Easter Sunday parade on Friday nights or Saturday nights.  And then when you got older, if you could afford a car, you drove up and down the street.  There was this big ice company.  And we lived in Franklin Plaza, right before the ice company.  And it was an all-black plaza.  We only had two bedrooms, and we needed three.  And because during that time, they didn't have four bedrooms.  We needed a larger unit.  They had three bedrooms and kind of like a little den which became my room ultimately.  But the only way for us to get it was for us to integrate an all-white plaza.  Well, I don't need to tell you that Mom signed up for that right away (laughter).  She was like, "Yeah, this sounds like a cause for Helen Jones Woods."  And so back in those days--it's interesting when I tell young people that back in those days, you had to have a job to live in the projects.  You had to be gainfully employed.  There was no welfare, okay.  You had to have a job if you lived in public housing in Omaha.  And so we became the first black family in the all-white plaza, and we caught hell.  We had to fight just about every single, solitary day of our lives for a prolonged period of time.
Story_ID: 319959
Speaker 1: When we left there [Omaha, Nebraska], it was the time that my [maternal] grandfather [Laurence C. Jones] once he convinced my mother [HistoryMaker Helen Jones Woods] to let me come see him, he decided to keep me, and she didn't have any choice.  And it was good because they were leaving the projects, and by now, my father [William A. Woods] is an accountant.  And so he becomes the comptroller for Piney Woods [Piney Woods Country Life School, Piney Woods, Mississippi].  And we moved to Piney Woods.  And that was our first house.  Our first house was at Piney Woods.  My grandfather built it for my mother.  Their relationship was not long lived.  They had a serious physical altercation in the dining hall, in front of the students.  And so, we had to flee in the middle of the night one evening because my grandfather was literally looking for his shotgun (laughter), right.  She learned tough love from her daddy, but he had said something she didn't like, and she threw the apple-butter jar across the dining room table.  And unfortunately, it hit bulls' eye.  And the student body was like, "Oh, my God.  Dr. Jones just got hit in the head with the apple-butter jar," (laughter).  We laugh about it now in the family.  Apple butter went everywhere.  Okay, the jar didn't break or anything, but the top was off of it, and it just went everywhere.  My grandfather was like, "I'm gonna kill you.  You haven't changed."  So my mama went home, packed us, and we all ran back to Omaha.  My daddy was like, "Well, I'm the comptroller of the school."  My mom was like, "We gotta get outta here, okay, all right.  I know my daddy.  And I've embarrassed him in front of his student body.  We will not survive the night.  He's gonna burn this house down and everybody's gonna die except Castoria [HistoryMaker Cathy Hughes] (laughter). Okay, let's go."  So, but they were able in later years to get their relationship back on some type of cordial basis to the point where I got to visit him during the summertime.  I would go and spend summers with him.
Story_ID: 319960
Speaker 1: So elementary school, what was the name of the elementary school, and can you spell it.  It had a strange name.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Duchesne [Duchesne Academy of the Sacred Heart, Omaha, Nebraska] was high school.
Speaker 1: Oh, Duchesne, okay, so what--.
Speaker 2: Duchesne was high school, and Duchesne is D-U-C-H-E-S-N-E, Duchesne Academy of the Sacred Heart.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The nuns were semi-cloister, which means that they can never be seen by men.  And we wore white gloves and stockings all four years of high school.  And you curtsied any time--they're called Madams of the Sacred Heart, and when you meet them in the hallway or you pass them in a classroom or when you enter a classroom, you curtsy.  And they are, they are the female counterparts to the Jesuits.  All of them have Ph.D.s.  They are considered the intelligentsia, the women intelligentsia of the Catholic hierarchy.  And so by grade school, my first grade school was St. John's [St. John's School, Omaha, Nebraska].  St. John's--I started to kindergarten the same day my father [William A. Woods] started to college [Creighton University, Omaha, Nebraska].  My mother [HistoryMaker Helen Jones Woods] was so proud.  She got up that morning and sent her husband and her oldest child off, and at that time, her only child.  I was an only child on that first year.  By the time I was in the first grade, my brother [Billy Woods] had arrived.  But anyway, the first six years of my life, I was an only child.  And St. John's was on the campus of Creighton University.  And it was an experimental school which I think has a lot to do with why I was able to do certain things in life, because I never completed college.  I was pregnant at sixteen, a mother by seventeen.  And although I have had a lot of college classes and probably, if I put all my credits together and some university would, you know, allow them to be accepted, I would have enough for a degree, but I do not have a college degree.  And I think it was my foundation that I received that allowed me to self-educate myself, because I had such good schools that I attended and such good teachers that worked with me.  My son [HistoryMaker Alfred Liggins, III], I put him in the same type of experimental program, although it wasn't a Catholic school. My son's nursery school.  For three years, he attended a school where all the teachers had Ph.D.s, because that had been my experience.  And the foundation that you get when you have teachers that are serious about education themselves and are very much into early childhood development.  It wasn't even called that then, but that's what it was.  It was Head Start before its time.  It was early childhood development.  From St. John's, we went to Piney Woods [Mississippi].  When I came back from Piney Woods--
Speaker 1: Now, how long were you at Piney Woods?
Speaker 2: Almost three years.
Speaker 1: Okay, do you know the years?
Speaker 2: No, I'm sorry.
Speaker 1: Approximately--okay.
Speaker 2: But I can get them for you.
Speaker 1: That's okay.
Speaker 2: When we came back, I went for one year to Sacred Heart [Sacred Heart School; Sacred Heart Elementary School, Omaha, Nebraska], which was a Catholic school.  And then I was ready for ninth grade.  I did my eighth grade at Sacred Heart and finished the last year.  And then I went to Duchesne Academy of the Sacred Heart for my freshman through senior year of high school--
Story_ID: 319961
Speaker 1: --I want you to take yourself back to, you know, Omaha [Nebraska], and those times.  And I was wondering if you could tell me what sights, smells and sounds remind you of growing up?
Speaker 2: Oh, please.  The smells.  Omaha is the stockyards.  And what a lot of people don't realize is the reason Omaha was such a big cattle city was they actually drove the herds into the slaughter pens.  They didn't come in by truck or train.  They came in on foot (laughter).  They actually--just like on TV when you would see 'Bonanza' and the others, they actually drove them through a section of the city.  And so you had this dust, but also cows are not dumb.  And they could smell the blood of the slaughterhouse.  And they would give off an odor like you would not believe, and depending on how the wind would blow.  So we grew up, and naturally, the housing projects were built in the path of the wind (laughter) from the slaughterhouses.  But Omaha, Nebraska during my childhood had this terrible, terrible, terrible odor of the slaughterhouses that people in Omaha say, "Girl, you need to shut up complaining about that smell.  That's money you smelling." Because slaughterhouses were unionized early in American history.  And black folks with no education were making twenty-five, thirty dollars an hour, twenty-five, thirty years ago, working in those slaughterhouses.  I mean, unbelievable salaries were made in those slaughterhouses.  But the smell was absolutely unbelievable.  The sound was the same sound that people now describe as tornadoes.  Cattle rumble the ground.  You actually feel the ground, and you hear the thunder.  And it sounds like a train is the best description I can make.  And they now--I hear people describing tornadoes--now that the Weather Channel is one of the most popular channels.  When the Weather Channel first came out, my dear friend, [HistoryMaker] Dick Gregory, said, "TV is just gone too far now.  Who in the world is gonna watch a weather channel?"  One of the most popular cable channels (laughter) in existence, the weather.  Everybody and particularly a tornado week, everybody tunes in.  But that's how they describe it, as a train.  That's how the, the cattle being driven to the slaughterhouses; they created these big, big clouds of dust.  They rumble the earth, and they make this rumbling sound like a tornado.  And they cry.  They make squealing sounds when they would smell the slaughter of the cows that were before them.  And so the sights and sounds that I grew up with as a child are primarily of that of the slaughterhouse.  But then some of the more pleasant sounds and sights, there was this old black man.  And his name was Mr. Poor [ph.].  And Mr. Poor had a hot tamale wagon, that he would come to the projects, and if we had been real, real good, Mama [HistoryMaker Helen Jones Woods] would allow us to buy a hot tamale for a nickel and we would split it four ways.  And the smell of those--to this day, even though I don't eat red meat, 'cause I just imagine the hot tamales are not red meat.  Any time, I smell that hot tamale, it's like a flashback to my childhood.  I seek them out.  I'll be places like in Texas and other places that have--and I can tell by the smell whether it's one of Mr. Poor's hot tamales.  And in the summertime, the ice cream truck would come out.
Story_ID: 317929
Speaker 1: My most vivid memory of sight, sights when I was a youngster; the bookstand at the Hinky Dinky grocery store.  My mother [HistoryMaker Helen Jones Woods] went grocery shopping every Friday evening, and she took all of us--to the grocery store with us.  And she would deposit us at the bookstand and make us read the books.  And I think that's why I love to read today.  And we could not move away from the bookstand.  And then when she would finish her grocery shopping, she would come back, and she would come back, and we would be allowed to pick out what one book or magazine we wanted.  During those days grocery stores had, as they are returning to now, big magazine, newspapers, bookstands--'cause they didn't have Barnes & Noble, and they didn't have bookstores back then.  Grocery stores is where you bought your books.  And my favorite magazine was True Confession.  And my mother used to beat my behind when she would catch me reading True Confession.  So I'd be watching her go down the produce aisle, and then I would take the True Confession magazine, and I would put it inside a Life magazine which was a big magazine.  And I would read my True Confession stories.  And she was always so pleased with Cathy [HistoryMaker Cathy Hughes] who never would fidget and never would leave the magazine and book section.  My brothers [Billy Woods and Bobby Woods] and little sister [Jackie Woods], they'd be wandering off and like, "Oh, Mama, can we have some Lucky Charms? Can we have this cereal, can we--?" And she'd like, "Go back to the book section."  Cathy would never do that, because Cathy would be reading Life magazine.  And one day I got busted.  She realized that I had been putting True Confession inside--and she would always say, "Do you want me to buy you that Life magazine?"  And I'd say, "Oh, no, ma'am, I've already read it."  My second most vivid sight, and so many sounds connected with it, was Joslyn Art Museum [Omaha, Nebraska].  My mother felt that we should go to the art museum many weekends and to all of their special programs.  And the museum offered just a whole, long list of diversified activities for young people and adults.  There were cooking classes.  There were arts and crafts, painting, so many different things that you could do at the museum.  So, I kind of spent free time and grew up in the museum, and museums have a special smell.  And so, so much of my memory bank, in terms of pleasant aromas, if it's not Mr. Poor's [ph.] hot tamale truck, it's the museum's special smells that were associated with painting and sculptures and arts and crafts and cooking classes and so many other wonderful activities for young people.  After we left the museum, we went to the library.  And we all had library cards.  My mother had a regimen that she followed with all of her children.
Story_ID: 317930
Speaker 1: The type of child I was, I was a challenging child.  I was very inquisitive.  My [maternal] grandfather [Laurence C. Jones] nicknamed me "Castoria [HistoryMaker Cathy Hughes]," and I don't think that he just meant because I was gonna be so wonderful.  I think that part of it was, why my mother [HistoryMaker Helen Jones Woods] took objection to it, that I gave folks, adults, a run for their money.  I always questioned things.  I was a terrible teenager.  I was pregnant at sixteen.  I tried my best--I did everything I possibly could do to get expelled from Duchesne [Duchesne Academy of the Sacred Heart, Omaha, Nebraska].  I hated it so badly.  Here I'm living in a lower middle-class existence.  By now, my father's [William A. Woods] out of college [Creighton University, Omaha, Nebraska], but we're really struggling trying to get his business going.  There are six of us living in a two-bedroom house with one bathroom.  We still haven't figured out--we have family meetings, we try to figure out where we slept (laughter). We have no collective memory of where all the bodies went, all right.  And now that we look at the house, we're like, who slept where?  How did we do this?  How did six individuals in this one house share this one bathroom, and everybody left out clean and polished and everything.  But I hated school, because I'm in school with these very wealthy, white girls who go home to maids and servants.  And so often, some of my friends, their parents were the--my classmates' servants.  I would come to my classmates' house for a study session or for a meeting of Girl Scouts [Girl Scouts of the United States of America] or something.  And I would know Ms. Jones [ph.] in the kitchen.  I'd be, "Hey, Ms. Jones, how you doing?  How's Portia [ph.]?"  And Ms. Jones would be like, "I can't talk to you right now, baby.  I'm talk--I'm working, can't talk to you right now."  And then my classmate would be like, "How do you know Mable [ph.]?"  And I'm like, "Oh, Mable's daughter and I are good friends."  And it created this, this confusion in me.  So, I would get expelled as regularly as possible.  I robbed the bookstore.  I went in there and stole all the pencils and pads one afternoon (laughter).  Now, remember, I'm (unclear) (laughter)--and then organized two other girls.  They told.  They got scared when we got busted.  Father Markoe [John P. Markoe] was like, "No, you will not expel her.  You will work with her."  And, "She's doing this because she's not comfortable.  And, you know, she's a child.  You all are adults.  You're a--you're nuns.  You're supposed to be educators.  So educate her.  Get her comfortable.  Make her feel good about herself.  And, you know, I'm not going to allow you all to cop out and put her out."  It's not gonna go down like this.  Remember, her tuition is being paid by the president of the United States of America [President Dwight David "Ike" Eisenhower].  You want an incident?"  And so they would take me back, and finally, the last resort was getting pregnant.  I was like, I'm trying to get out of here by some type of way.  When I graduated from high school, I was pregnant.  We graduated in white.  It was not black tie.  It was white tie.  The fathers had to be in full tails, white tuxedos.  We graduated in white flowing gowns, carrying a dozen of red roses with the white gloves up to here.  And I had my little baby in my stomach.  And everyone's like, "Cathy looks like she's pregnant."  And I can't tell you how much joy it gave me.  I am--because I just was so rebellious.  I realize now that part of it.  Education is very big with me.  That's why I stay, you know, supportive of Piney Woods [Piney Woods Country Life School, Piney Woods, Mississippi].  So much of it was because they were not challenging me mentally.  They were not making any--and Father Markoe was correct.  He may have been explaining it and articulating in different terms.  But it was their obligation.  I mean, I can't remember what the tuition was back then.  My mother and I were talking about it the other day, and we think it was $7,500 a year, which again was--I'm almost sixty years old.  We're talking about forty years ago, all right.  We're talking about big dollars for my education.  It was their obligation to find out what is making her act like this?  Why is she uncomfortable?  Why is she, you know--sometimes with the tests, I would actually sit in class and put my hands over my eyes and just mark down the, you know, and they would be like, we can't deal with her.  Well, they didn't wanna deal with me because I was their first black student.  And it was easier for them to dismiss me than it was to extend themselves.  And now, I understand that that's why so many black children end up on prescription drugs as well as illegal drugs on their own, and why so many of them drop out of school, and why so many of them are classified as troubled.  It's not--they're not the problem.  It's the teacher that's the problem, and the whole African concept of you having everything, you know, contained within you at birth, and that it is society's responsibility to assist you in bringing it out of you, as opposed to the Western belief that you're a blank slate, and you're supposed to put information in and have it regurgitated out.  And I realized that God had blessed me.  A lot of it had to do with my genes and my ancestry, and I had a lot of information in me.  And nobody was plugging into how to correctly pull it out of me.
Story_ID: 317931
Speaker 1: And God blessed me by allowing me to get pregnant at sixteen, because it was the birth of my child at seventeen that turned my life around.  And I tell young people this story all of the time.  My son's [HistoryMaker Alfred Liggins, III] father whose name also was Alfred [Alfred Liggins, Jr.] was what the hip-hoppers now call a member of the thug life.  He was an active member of the thug life.  He was very good to me.  And most thug life men, they love their babies.  So, he was very good to his baby.  But remember, I told you, my mother [HistoryMaker Helen Jones Woods] believed in exposure.  She believed in making certain that her children were all right.  So--and my father [William A. Woods] worked at the Omaha Club [Omaha, Nebraska], and so I had beautiful, expensive clothes; even though they might have been hand-me-downs, very often, they were brand new hand-me-downs coming from my father's job.  My mother being from Mississippi, believed that if you didn't have a roof over your head, you were supposed to have expensive shoes on your feet 'cause Mississippi black folks believed--because they were on their feet so much, that you couldn't let your arches fall, that if your feet hurt, everything was out of kilter in your life, that you had to make certain that you had good shoes on your feet, and your children had good shoes.  So, I had good things as I was growing up, although we were living in the projects, and we were poor.  My mother believed in keeping us well dressed and keeping good shoes on us.  So, I say to young girls that the reason that I didn't become a victim of the thug life was because I wasn't impressed when my gangster, hustling husband would come home--and he was seven years older than me.  He was in his mid-twenties when I wasn't but seventeen.  And he'd bring me two leather coats that he had bought from the hot man.  I didn't want a hot coat.  And I couldn't wear but one leather coat at a time.  I wanted to go in the department store and try it on as I had always as a child.  I wasn't interested in it coming in a brown paper bag.  I wanted it in a box with tissue, with a bow around it.  So I say to young girls all the time, I said, "How old is your mama?"  And they say, "Oh, she eighteen years older than me."  I said, "So when you were a baby, didn't your mama put diamond studs in your ear?"  "Uh-huh, how you know?"  I said, "Because most mamas in the generation that you're in put diamond studs in their baby's ears."  I said, "Didn't your mama always have you dressed real cute?"  "Uh-huh".  I said, "Then why are you living with a hustler because he put diamond studs in your baby's ears?"  I said, "You already had that.  You were already exposed to that."  And for some reason, I understood that at seventeen.  I was like, you not doing anything for me that my mama and daddy struggled to do already.  So I'm not impressed with this thug life.  I'm not impressed with you being a gangster and a hustler.  And most importantly, I don't want that around my baby.  Alfred's birth changed my life and changed my thinking, 'cause the only reason I was with this gangster in the first place, was I trying to show my parents, okay, and my whole environment how I hated them and how rebellious I was.  But once I got in it, I was like, this isn't how I want my child to grow up.  And so I'm very effective dealing with teenage mamas because all of them say the same thing to me.  It's like, "Wow, Ms. H [HistoryMaker Cathy Hughes]--which is my nickname--we never thought of that."  I said, "You always had, already had all this.  So why are you tolerating this boy dealing drugs around you and your child, so that you can get some diamond studs, so that he can lay a C note on you?  You don't need the Bennies.  You already had Benjamins [$100 bills].  Your mama and your daddy gave 'em to you, because you, your parents were the start of this generation. This whole hip-hop culture that you're in, that you're a part of.  It ain't new, bling, bling ain't new.  Blinging been going on a long time in the black community."  All of 'em say the same thing, "You're absolutely correct."  I said, "So you're letting the police chase him into your house around your baby?  You're letting him go upside your head?"
Story_ID: 317932
Speaker 1: And what broke me and my son's father [Alfred Liggins, Jr.] up--he was very good to me, helped me around the house, took his son [HistoryMaker Alfred Liggins, III] everywhere.  As I said, would bring me hot stuff until I start saying, no, okay.  Give me a credit card.  I wanna go downtown and go shopping.  I don't want the hot man bringing me stuff in a brown grocery store bag.  But one day, he threatened me.  He told me what he would do to me.  And the very next day, I went and filed for divorce.  And, again, I shared this story with young people, I said, "Because anybody who's a gangster, anybody who's a member of the thug life, that's just a preview of upcoming events, just like when you go to the movies.  They show you what's coming up next, so when they start issuing the threats, you can rest assured the blows ain't too far behind."  And I wanted to make certain that I didn't get to see that feature film.  So I got myself right on up out of the theater.  And it took me a long time to get a divorce, because he was so much older and mature and clever.  He was a very successful hustler.  He convinced the court system I was just young and being emotional.  And he gave all types of evidence of how good he was being to me.  You know, he was sending me to night school [at University of Nebraska Omaha, Omaha, Nebraska].  He had someone come in once a week to help clean the house so that, you know, I could go to school and helped with the baby.  And I had to admit to the judge and the court that, yes, he took the child everywhere and did all these things with him, and blah, blah, blah.  But I was determined that I was not gonna stay around until I got brutalized.  And I tell all of them, I said, "The minute they start calling you out your name, they have lost respect for you.  Then, they start threatening you.  Then, all you're doing is looking at some previews of upcoming events because they will start laying hands on you."  And my daddy [William A. Woods] was very close to me, and he told me on a regular basis, "If you don't do anything else, do not ever allow a man to put his hands on you."  He used to say, "Lord knows I should've beat your mama's ass (laughter), but I never did, and don't you ever, ever let a man put his hand--." And so I grew up in that environment.  And my mother [HistoryMaker Helen Jones Woods] to this day laughs about it.  She said, "Your daddy used to always say that he needed to kick my behind.  But he never did."  And so I was not going to allow myself to stay in that circumstance and particularly, with my son.  That environment was terrible.  And I knew that at seventeen, eighteen.  By the time, I was nineteen, I was single.  I was out of there.  I was on my own.  And he died a few years back, and on his deathbed, he paid me the greatest compliment which was, "I thank you for how you reared my son, and I thank you most of all for getting him out of the environment that involved me."
Story_ID: 317933
Speaker 1: And yet, I didn't keep him [Hughes' son, HistoryMaker Alfred Liggins, III] away from his father [Alfred Liggins, Jr.].  He visited his father.  His father loved him very much, but I was not going to let him grow up with the gangsters and the hustlers because my son is very smart.  And I knew at an early age, just like myself--and again, if my mother [HistoryMaker Helen Jones Woods] hadn't exposed me, if my mother hadn't had us as her top priority, if my mother hadn't concentrated on trying to give us the very best that she could, and like I said, that Christmas where she dismantled Christmas (laughter), where she canceled Christmas, even though it was classical 45s and books that we got that Christmas, it was still the very best of that category.  It was the whole collection of 45s.  So I already knew what it meant for someone to want to give you the very best.  And I think that that's what so many young girls, these teenage mamas, they get confused with.  "You know, my daddy--baby's daddy bought me a car, so I can take the baby--." Well, he's supposed to provide you with transportation.  He's supposed to do these things.  My mama and daddy [William A. Woods] lied on my driver's license. In Omaha [Nebraska], you can get your license at fifteen.  I had mine at fourteen, because they falsified the form that you have to fill out.  They struggled, and the first car cost fifty dollars, but they got me some wheels.  So I say to them, "That's what you should do for your child, so that when your baby girl grows up, no hustler, no gangster, no thug lifer, can come in here and mess up their life, impressing them with material things, because you've already had those things.  You've already been exposed, and God intends so much more for you."  So, it was Alfred's birth that caused me to really wake up because I was very much infatuated with that fast life, as young girls are today.  I was very--I felt that this baby gave me a right to be on the same level as my mother.  I felt that being a mama myself, gave me some rights to do what I wanted to do.  But his birth made me rethink, and more importantly than anything else, it made me think about how much I did not know, how much I didn't have, and how vulnerable I really was to the whole world at that point, because I had this innocent child that I was responsible for protecting and rearing and nurturing and caring for, and I didn't have a clue.
Story_ID: 317934
Speaker 1: Now, when you left--you left your husband [Alfred Liggins, Jr.], right?
Speaker 2: (Nods head).
Speaker 1: Did you move back in with your parents [HistoryMaker Helen Jones Woods and William A. Woods]?
Speaker 2: Oh, no.  She would not allow that.  My son was six years old before my mother let him spend the night in her house.  My mother practiced tough love.  My mother and his mother both tried to convince me to allow them to raise him.  And I said, "No, I got this."  Again, I'm still pregnant.  I'm thinking I'm knowing everything.  I'm working, making good money, all right.  I forgot the part of the story.  When I was almost fourteen, not quite fourteen, I used to help this woman who was the first black supervisor at the phone company.  And she told me about how the phone company was hiring young, black women in high school and college.  You had to be a senior.  And so I coopted her, and she helped me lie, and I went in, and I was working forty hours a week when I was in the eleventh and twelfth grade in high school.  So I was building my little nest egg and really getting myself together financially.  So, I felt that I knew everything.  So, no, heavens no.  One of the greatest compliments that was paid me at that time, I did not realize, was paid by my mother-in-law whom I'm still very close to.  And she said, "You want to be a good mother, and so I'm gonna help you.  If you need to ever move into my house, 'cause I know you don't wanna go home, nor will your mother allow it, you are welcome to move here."  And when I divorced her son, he thought he could go home to her house.  She had a big, six-bedroom house.  And she has a big, six-bedroom house, still lives in the same place after all these years.  And she told him, "No."  She said, "I'm keeping that room empty in case Cathy [HistoryMaker Cathy Hughes] and little Alfred [HistoryMaker Alfred Liggins, III] ever have to come back home."  And when she said to me, "You really wanna be a good mother," that was such a great compliment.  It just boosted my ego because everybody else was telling me I couldn't do it.  And she said, "You know, if you need me, I'm here."  And I went and got an apartment.  And I went to work full time, and I reared my son.  And at a certain point in my life, when I saw an opportunity to leave Omaha [Nebraska] to expose him to a different way of life, I took that opportunity and moved to Washington, D.C.
Story_ID: 317935
Speaker 1: And talk about that.  How did you end up coming [to Washington, D.C.]?  What was the (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, Tony Brown was the dean of the School of Communications at Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.], brand new School of Communications at Howard.  Tony was the first dean.  He was setting it up.  And we didn't have a black studies department as such at the University of Nebraska at Omaha [University of Nebraska Omaha, Omaha, Nebraska], where I was taking courses.  But we did have a black studies committee.  And then we had a black studies chairman who was in charge of the courses they taught in black studies, by the name of Dr. Milton White.  I'm taking classes, dating Dr. Milton White.  And Tony Brown is coming to Omaha [Nebraska].  He was our favorite speaker.  He would come frequently to the University of Nebraska at Omaha and lecture us.  One of the reasons he loved Omaha so, is Omaha is the home of Warren Buffett.  And Warren Buffett's wife, Suzie [Susan Buffett], was the leading civil rights advocate in Omaha, Nebraska.  All the protests, meetings of that next generation took place in her home.  She was on the front line all the time.  So she and Warren wanted to see Tony Brown's, 'Tony Brown's Journal,' the show that he produces and hosts.  And where they lived, they couldn't get reception.  And so Warren and Suzie bought a house in a different neighborhood where they could get 'Tony Brown's Journal.'  Well, this just blew Tony Brown away because even then, although Warren Brown--Warren Buffett was not the richest man in America then, as he went on to be before Bill Gates, he was still very wealthy, very affluent.  And the fact that this wealthy family thought enough of his show to move, just kind of endeared him to Omaha.  So he would come for our demonstrations.  He'd come for meetings.  He'd come for lectures.  So he ended up ultimately offering Dr. Milton White the chairmanship of the department in the newly-formed School of Communications at Howard.  Dr. White said to me, "You will be okay if you stay in Omaha.  I don't think Alfred [Hughes's son, HistoryMaker Alfred Liggins, III] will be.  He deserves more.  He needs to be exposed to more.  He needs to be around more black folks."  There're only like forty thousand black folks in Omaha, Nebraska.  "He needs to see more than little Joslyn Museum [Joslyn Art Museum, Omaha, Nebraska] that you grew up in.  He needs to see the Smithsonian [Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C.] and the Library of Congress [Washington, D.C.] and the African American museum, and a lot of other things that Washington, D.C. offers."  It wasn't hard to convince me, because my father [William A. Woods] was already gonna open an office here.  So, I had been back and forth, wasn't expecting him to die, but felt comfortable coming with Milton because I was fairly familiar, felt my father's friend, Mr. Jenkins [John Jenkins] could get me a government job, just things were in place, knew Tony Brown well enough to feel that I knew some folks here.
Story_ID: 317936
Speaker 1: So I moved here [Washington, D.C.], but I didn't realize that my grief was--it was harder on me here than it was being in Omaha, [Nebraska] 'cause in Omaha, I had Mom [HistoryMaker Helen Jones Woods] and friends and church and all of the rest of my comfortable environment that I had grown up in.  Here I felt isolated, didn't know anybody, and I used to write letters home to my mother telling her that there were so many black folks, that I was staring so hard, my eyeballs were tired at the end of the day.  It was so wonderful, seeing black women wearing their geles and the beautiful--during this time period in--Washington, D.C. has always been very African centered.  But during this day and time, it was fashionable, the dashikis, the sisters wore the wraps, the geles, I mean you didn't come to class on Howard's [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] campus, faculty or student without your head wrapped.  Everybody wrapped their heads back in those days, had Afros.  You should have seen me in the bathroom with a box of Tide soap because someone had told me that Tide would give me an Afro.  So I was trying to get my hair to (laughter) go into a bush, okay.  I finally got the wrap of the gele correct, okay.  So I wore my ge--I was just so proud.  It was so wonderful.  It was so great for Alfred [Hughes' son, HistoryMaker Alfred Liggins, III] to be able to see, you know, this whole proliferation of black intelligentsia, black progress, black activity, black history, black everything.  And so I was a happy camper.  But I was still isolated and lonely because I wasn't home, and my daddy [William A. Woods] wasn't here with me.  And so I didn't do anything for the first six months.  I just kind of explored D.C., took Alfred to the museums and various places.  And Tony Brown said, "What are you doing?"  There was a social affair, and Milton [Milton White] took me, and Tony cornered me and said, "What are you doing?"  I said, "Really, nothing."  And so he's like, "I'm, you know, setting up the new faculty for the new School of Communications [at Howard University, Washington, D.C.], and I'd like for you to be a part of that faculty."  And I was like, "You know, I never graduated."  He said, "No, I know that and neither did [HistoryMaker] Quincy Jones and [HistoryMaker] Melvin Van Peebles," who were all part-[HistoryMaker] Stan Lathan.  We were all part of that first faculty.  He said, "I want my students at Howard University in the School of Communications to be as committed to their community as they will be to their craft.  If they're gonna be a journalist, I want them not to just give whitewashed news.  I want them to give news from a black perspective.  If they're on TV, I want them not just to cover, If it bleeds, it leads.  I want them to argue with their news director."  And then he stopped himself.  He said, "No, better still. I want them to be the news director."  He said, "And I think that you can help me do that."  So I was kind of the community activist in residence.  I was in charge of getting the student body in the School of Communications into the community.  We set up newsletters.  We did projects.  We did incredible things.  Most importantly, he allowed me to implement an idea that they still do at Howard today, called the Communications Conference and different then than today.  You could not attend the Communications Conference unless you were going to hire on the spot, some of our students.
Story_ID: 317937
Speaker 1: Now, you brought a lot of skills to the position because you had worked with your father [William A. Woods].  You had, you know, business skills from him, right?
Speaker 2: Well, not only that, I had helped build the OIC, Opportunities Industrialization Center.  I worked for Dr. Leon Sullivan.  We had built a center in Omaha [Nebraska].  I had been the personnel assistant--personnel director for Western Electric [Western Electric Company].  I had always been a community activist.  And I can't tell you how honored I was to be like a community activist in residence at Howard University [Washington, D.C.].  I was the intake counselor for all of the freshmen students.  We did all types of incredible projects, holiday projects, newsletters, volunteer, public relations.  We did so many things in the community, and so many of the students, to this day, say that the reason that they stayed in school or the reason that they were so excited about being in the School of Communications [at Howard University, Washington, D.C.] had to do with the various activities that I kept them involved in.  And so Tony [Tony Brown] being--first time he had been a dean, gave me the title of lecturer[AB1].  It was probably the only title that fit our category that he had to put me in.  But really I was in charge of making certain that the students had a social consciousness that would require and motivate and stimulate them to not just get their degree and become appreciably no different than a white journalist.  This, this whole thing of information and commitment from an African American perspective is what years later, because of Tony Brown, I ended up doing with my first radio station that I owned, WOL [WOL Radio, Washington, D.C.], which was the first twenty-four hour talk station in the country, from an African American perspective.
Story_ID: 317938
Speaker 1: My days at Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] were very, very, very difficult.  I ended up having to report ultimately, after three different supervisors, to a General Davison [Frederic E. Davison] who would say frequently to me that he did not feel that a woman should be the general manager of the Howard University radio station [WHUR Radio, Washington, D.C.].  I had a regiment that I followed very, very closely.  My son [HistoryMaker Alfred Liggins, III] came to my office every day.  It's no accident that Alfred's now my president and CEO [at Radio One, Lanham, Maryland].  He likes to say facetiously that he didn't think--he thought everybody in the world worked in a radio station, that he didn't know until he was sixteen that people had other jobs because every day of his life, he came to the radio station.  I would either pre-prepare, cook his dinner at home, bring it in, warm it up or I would go to a restaurant, and we would sit down--I had candles and everything, little table cloth.  We would have dinner in my office.  And then we would do his homework, and then he would get to watch TV or hang out in the radio station because I was putting in fourteen, sixteen-hour days, and I was not going to allow my son to be home by himself.  The general would come to the station, put my child out, raise sand.  I get credit for creating the Quiet Storm and really bringing a whole different aspect to communications to Howard University.  An area that I don't get credit for, that I know I'm directly responsible for is, early childhood development and childcare.  Howard has one of the best childcare programs of any of the universities in the country.  And it was because I kept lobbying them, and so many single mamas and daddies also, they empathized and sympathized with me.  They're like, "We wanna bring our kids."  What, what black mama or father doesn't want their child to hang out on a college campus?  This is the best environment a young person could possibly grow up in.  This is why Jewish children do so well in business, because their parents bring 'em to the office, bring 'em to the store, bring 'em to the pharmacy.  This is a good thing she's doing.  General Davison thought it was terrible.  He would punish me in so many mean-spirited ways.  He--I had jury duty.  He docked my pay.  I was like, "General Davison, that's illegal. We're a government--."  We were getting GS [General Schedule level] checks, and we were--at that time, Howard University, which is a land-grant college--most people don't realize that it's federally funded.  That's the reason, when you see the United Negro College Fund [UNCF], Howard is not a member of that because it is a land-grant college.  It belongs to the federal government.  The federal government used to issue our paychecks, and we were GS-rated, which stands for government service [sic.], just like all government employees.  I used to say to my mama [HistoryMaker Helen Jones Woods], "In a way, I work for the government."  Howard wasn't allowed to have its own bank account back then.  The United States government treasury was the payroll keeper for Howard University.  So anyway, I said, "You know, I work for the government, General Davison; you can't dock my pay for jury duty."  Then one day I was just crying and a gentleman who's been so instrumental in keeping my head on right when I worked at Howard, and even to this day is such a good friend and helped me with my first investors, group of investors when I wanted to work for myself and became one of those initial investors; [HistoryMakers] Ofield Dukes is his name.  Ofield said to me, "Cathy [HistoryMaker Cathy Hughes], you must be understanding and patient of the general.  He's shell shocked."  I said, "Shell shocked?"  He said, "Yes.  He did three tours of duty in Vietnam."  Well, my heart melted.  I've been a big supporter of Vietnam [Vietnam War] veterans.  I've participated in all types of programs over the years, had no idea that that was the general's problem, that Vietnam had had this adverse--after that I had no problems with him.  Whatever he wanted to do, I just smiled and said, "Yes, sir," because I realized that what this brother had been through had rendered him this mean-spirited individual that he had become.  And I felt that it was almost like God had given him to me to kind of soften him up and make him know that life was worth living again, because I was really about ready to quit my job and leave Howard and tell the general and the university to, you know, just forget it.  But after that, my whole attitude changed, and my level of productivity went up.  And I really start even liking the general after that, because I realized that anybody that had to go to Vietnam, three tours of duty, my God, they--the things that this man must have seen and had been through.  And then being an African American general on top of it.  But my days were very, very troubled.
Story_ID: 317939
Speaker 1: Ultimately, I was offered a position that I could not turn down [with the Washington Area Broadcasters Association].  Not only was it a doubling of my salary, but it was also an opportunity to take a signal that had been dark for twelve years and put it on the air.  So I got to do everything from A to Z.  I got to pick the call letters, choose the staff, select the format, everything.  And I knew this experience would be very valuable to me.  So I submitted my letter of resignation to Dr. Cheek [HistoryMaker James Cheek], who, although he had not persecuted and prosecuted and, and harassed and mistreated me, he had stood quietly by what was going on [at WHUR Radio, Washington, D.C.].  The general [Frederic E. Davison] was later replaced as my supervisor by a woman who had no concept, no idea what radio was about and was even harder to work with than the general, because the general was highly intelligent.  This woman was not particularly bright, I'm sorry to say, and was in charge and just would come up with silly things, such as, she couldn't understand why my air personalities only were working five-hour days instead of eight hours like everyone else.  I'm like, "'Cause they have to be in here at 5:00 A.M. in the morning."  And she just couldn't get this together.  She felt that we should put them on a part-time basis and pay them hourly instead of paying them an annual--just stupid stuff.  So I was pretty much fed up, and I submitted my resignation, and Dr. Cheek called me in and said that he had never in all of his years of being a college president, ever asked anyone to withdraw a letter of resignation.  But he was asking me, and then he said, "I'm not asking you.  I'm petitioning you.  Do not leave us.  It will be a big mistake on your part."  And I said, "Dr. Cheek, all the hassle, all the pain, all the misery was well worth it to hear you say that to me," and I said, "I love you, and I respect you so much, but I've gotta go."  He said, "You're making the worst mistake of your life."  About ten years later, I bump into Dr. Cheek.  He said, "Was I stupid sitting there telling you it was a mistake for you to leave me (laughter)."  He said, "I should have gone with you and invested in you (laughter)."  And I'm so proud to say that on May 14th, the year 2005, President H. Patrick Swygert [HistoryMaker H. Patrick Swygert], the present, the president of Howard University [Washington, D.C.] is going to bestow an honorary doctorate of communications on me.  And I have over the years, received honorary doctorates from the Syracuse University, Newhouse School of Communications [S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications, Syracuse, New York], from Lincoln University.  None of them, all of them combined, will not have the same meaning as Howard University saying, "You did a good job for us, Cathy [HistoryMaker Cathy Hughes], and we are appreciative."  So on May 14th, 2005, my life will change because it was a pretty hard eight years that I spent laboring in the vineyard of Howard University.  Dr. Swygert has been so supportive.  When he first came in as the new president of Howard University, I was still doing my morning talk show.  And he came on my radio station for us to announce that, you know, he was the new president.  And my student interns lined up in my lobby to greet him.  And he comes off the air, and he says, "You have more of my students interning at your radio station than I have at my own radio station [WHUR Radio].  What's going on at my radio station?"  And I said, "Well, it kind of stopped when I left out because--." Because of my community involvement when I was on the faculty, when I became a staff member at the radio station, I just transferred that into working with the students.  While I was on the staff of Howard University, when I transferred from the faculty to the staff, I became the general sales manager of the radio station.  And then Dr. Cheek, on Christmas morning, 1975, December the 25th, the headline on the front page of the style section of The Washington Post says, "First Woman GM in Nation's Capital."  I was the first woman general manager of a broadcast facility in the nation's capital which is considered the news capital of the world.  And, again, while Dr. Cheek never protected me or defended me, he certainly did promote me and allow me to do things that had never been done before in the area of broadcasting which I guess was his quiet way of saying, "You're doing a good job."  Later he said those exact words.  But when Howard bestows this honorary doctorate on me, it will be the end to the story.  I can't tell you how painful it was for me when I left Howard University--
Story_ID: 317940
Speaker 1: I created for Howard University [Washington, D.C.] a program called the Quiet Storm, a format that almost got me fired.  Ultimately, it went on to become the most successful, urban format in the history of black radio.  It was on nearly five hundred radio stations at one time.  I tried to get Howard University to license that.  By now, they would have generated billions, with a B, not millions; billions of dollars in revenue.  Radio stations named their whole station the Quiet Storm and did my format 24/7.  I then tried to convince Howard to do a black Muzak, which still has not been done to this day.  Howard was building a new hospital.  And one of my fellow faculty members had been the highest ranking African American and the only African American actually with the Gallup Poll.  So he knew how to do polls.  He was a black pollster.  So we did a poll of four hundred African American professionals, doctors and lawyers and other professionals, real estate agents, insurance executives.  We asked them, number one, Leroy [ph.] said to me--that was the gentleman who was the pollster's name, that he had never seen it, 84 return, percent return rate, 84 percent of the four hundred people we polled returned their questionnaires.  They were willing at this time, which was how many decades ago, to pay up to hundred and fifty dollars a month for the service.  We described it as a black Muzak.  Howard University had the equipment.  When Katharine Graham, and The Washington Post gave WHUR [WHUR Radio, Washington, D.C.] to Howard University--WHUR, W-Howard University Radio.  It had before that been WTOP-FM Radio.  When they gave the station to Howard, they gave the equipment for a sub-channel.  Muzak is sub channel.  Muzak is actually an FM radio station on a sub channel.  We had the equipment.  All Howard had to do was say yes.  They were already wiring the hospital.  Every room in the Howard University Hospital [Washington, D.C.] has radio and television already wired in.  All I had to do was sit the transmitter in the basement and bring the signal up.  So there was no additional cost.  All they had to do is say yes.  They said no.  Here we have a 84 percent respondent rate.  We have people saying that they'd be willing to pay Howard up to hundred and fifty dollars a month to have a black Muzak service, because by now, my Quiet Storm was so successful, they knew it would be like the Quiet Storm.  But even today, it hasn't been done.  How many black professionals in the whole country would love to have a beautiful, black music service being pumped in.  Now, Muzak is no longer popular because we got CDs.  It kind of got--technology kind of kicked it out the back door.  I think it wouldn't have been kicked out the back door as quickly if there had of been a black version of it.  I think that white folks would have gussied it up a little bit.  Remember, it used to be called elevator music[AB2].
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: But they still have different forms of it.  It's just called different things.  When you go in grocery stores now, you have a version.  They even do their own commercials.  "You're listening to the Giant Food music network," you know.  Now, you have satellite radio.  You have so many other things.  So, by then I realized that Howard University did not have the level of understanding and appreciation for my innovations and ideas that God was blessing me with that I was sharing with them.  And I was not trying to get any--it wasn't for me.  I wasn't trying to get anything out of it.  It was for them.  It would have generated--in hindsight, I now understand.  Other than the bookstore, they had never had any type of revenue-generating ventures.  They didn't know about being in business, and remember, I said earlier, they were government funded.  So they were accustomed to filling out requisitions, sending it to the federal government, getting the money.  And they went through a lot of--as any, anybody would, all of a sudden they have hundreds of millions of dollars put in a bank account in their name.  They had to establish accounting procedures and, so they really didn't have an understanding, a time or a commitment to the radio station at that time.
Story_ID: 317941
Speaker 1: Can I ask, how did the radio station come?  Was that, was it that The Post [The Washington Post] had to--
Speaker 2: Diverse itself.  Yes, it was a divestiture.  Post-Newsweek [Post-Newsweek Stations; Graham Media Group] owned The Washington Post, Newsweek magazine, an AM and FM radio station, WTOP [WTOP Radio, Washington, D.C.], all-news radio was still the ultimate in Washington, D.C., 'cause as I said, we're the news capital.  They owned radio, two radio stations, a television station, a newspaper and a news magazine.  The FCC [Federal Communications Commission] didn't allow you to have that much control of news at that time.  This was before consolidation.  Now, what The Washington Post was doing makes them look like an angel compared to what Clear Channel [Clear Channel Communications, Inc.] is allowed to do with their control of the media.  But back then, you couldn't do it.  So they had to give something away.  They had to--or get rid of something.  They didn't have to give it away.  They decided that what would be wise is to give a radio station away.  Katharine Graham was presented with the proposition, give away a radio station.  She gave away WTOP-FM, which happens to be the finest radio signal in the nation's capital to this day, because FM had not come into its own.  Back then, everything was AM.  AM was popular.  And back then, it was eclectic, it was long-hair music, they called it, classical music and Pharoah Sanders holding a, one note for twenty-three minutes, crazy stuff.  Nobody was into FM.  Everyone was into AM.  So she thought she was giving away the lesser of her assets.  And she knew it was a commercial license, and she knew that universities, historically, only have public licenses.  And so they couldn't really make any money.  So she felt that it would really service two areas.  It would take care of her problem, but also be--three, actually, areas.  It'd be a revenue-generating vehicle for Howard University [Washington, D.C.], and it'd be a wonderful student lab because the students could then go, after they graduated, into employers and say, I have real-life experience.  I didn't work at a college radio station.  This is a commercial license that I worked on.  My Quiet Storm, the concept was that every year the number one student in the radio department would be given the distinction of hosting the Quiet Storm.  This would be like a perk.  This would be, this would encourage the students to be the best, because they would get a one-year gig at the radio station so that, again, when they graduated, they could go and get a, at that time, fifty, sixty, one hundred thousand dollar a year job.  Back then jocks [deejays] weren't making a million dollars or multiple millions a year.  And so this was going to be an opportunity for them to get real-life experience.  After Watergate, when some of Richard Nixon's [President Richard Milhous Nixon] cohorts and friends were trying to punish Katharine Graham for Watergate, they sued her over giving WHUR [WHUR Radio, Washington, D.C.] because, you know, Post-Newsweek is a publicly-held corporation.  And they felt that she had not lived up to her fiduciary responsibilities.  They won.  She had to do a major cash settlement with several of them who had sued her for giving WHUR to Howard University.  And she told me it's one of the biggest business mistakes that she ever made, and that if she had to do it over, she'd do it again tomorrow, because she was so pleased with what, you know, she had done ultimately for Howard University with WHUR.

Speaker 1: And after my tenure [at WHUR Radio, Washington, D.C.] and a couple more general managers--the general manager slot had been a revolving door.  I stayed longer than anybody up until that time.  And the one, the present general manager now, has the longest tenure of anyone.  But it went through a few more revolving door sessions, and then it really got itself together.  And I think that it has generated revenue for the university [Howard University, Washington, D.C.]; nothing compared to what it could have done had it done the black Muzak and had it licensed the Quiet Storm.  [HistoryMaker] Smokey Robinson was so thankful to me.  It resurrected his career.  He gave me the rights--he wrote the song ['Quiet Storm'].  He signed them over to the university.  He signed the rights to the song.  He gave the university the song.  They would have generated billions of dollars off the Quiet Storm format.  They had the rights to the music, the whole nine yards.  So I decided never again--God was blessing me. 'Cause see, when you grow up with a mother as talented as my mother [HistoryMaker Helen Jones Woods], and even though the world didn't know these stories about her music, I did.  Her children did, and you have no musical talent?  The Quiet Storm was the first testimony to me having any type of creative ability.  It was an affirmation for me that I had creative talent, that I knew--it was in a whole different genre, an area that I never even could conceptualize having creative talent in, but I am a programmer.  The thing that excites me most about our new venture, and I'm sure it frustrates my staff the most at TV One [Silver Spring, Maryland], but I'm a programmer.  God has really blessed me.  I know what the masses wanna hear, and I also know what they wanna see.  It's just this innate ability I have to talk to fifty people and come to a consensus of what they wanna hear.  Record companies tease me--Jeff [Jeff Majors], my significant other, teases me, because basically music's not my thing.  I love silence, 'cause I earn my living in sound, so silence, I really like.  When I tell you something is a hit, put your money on it, 'cause if I can hear, it's gonna be a major hi,t because it's not something that I listen to constantly.  I listen to a lot more gospel music than I've ever listened to any other type of genre of music.  But my preference in radio is talk radio.  I like news and talk.  Music is not my thing.  So if I tell you an artist is gonna pop, bank on it.  If I tell you a song is a hit, bank on it, because that, even though I earn my living in it, it's not my thing.  But I love programming.  I love the ability to take the medium of either radio or television and not only entertain my African American community, but also create a social consciousness.  I love the ability to make black folks feel good about themselves.  Lord knows, we need it so badly.  I mean, right now, as we speak, tonight you turn on the news, and the lead story's gonna be somebody killing somebody in the black community or getting arrested or just doing something horrible or somebody went bankrupt or just something ain't right.  And to have not one, but now two vehicles, to tell the story of the greatness and the glory of the African and African American experience, to slip in information and educate on, as the new saying is, on the DL [down low], to be able to, to overtly disseminate information that will ultimately impact the subconscious minds of my listeners and make them feel good about themselves, and make them want to do better and inspire them to reach for higher heights, but more importantly, make them unapologetic for their blackness, is the greatest blessing that God could ever have bestowed upon me.  And although it takes the sales and the business end to keep the venture alive, it's the programming end that that takes place in and with the Quiet Storm, I understood that I had a creative ability to connect, interact, motivate, inspire and uplift my people.  And so I can't tell you how joyous my career has been.  And now, here I am approaching sixty and I'm learning something new, and it's called cable. Like I say, I'm sure it doesn't make my employees too happy at TV One, because I mean, they're like, "What, does she sit up and memorize every show?" 'Cause I can tell them exactly (laughter) what happened on each show and what came out and what--and they're like, "When, where, are you sure, Ms. Hughes [HistoryMaker Cathy Hughes]?"  And I'm like, "Yeah, I'm positive."  And that's what I've done for so many years with radio.
Story_ID: 317943
Speaker 1: Now, I wanna ask; you were new to radio when you came to Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.], right?
Speaker 2: No, no, no, no.
Speaker 1: What (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I was not new to radio when I came Howard.  The reason Tony Brown, who ultimately transferred me from--Howard started to raise sand about the fact that I was really the community activist in residence, and my title was a lecturer, and I wasn't a lecturer.  I didn't have a class.  I had a class, but it was called Community Organization.  And we met whenever there was a project, okay, and the kids came at will.  They didn't have to sign up for it.  They didn't have any--well, they signed up for it, but they didn't get any credit for it, okay.  And so he transferred me to the staff at the radio station [WHUR Radio, Washington, D.C.], because while he was coming to Omaha [Nebraska] doing the lectures, I was involved with a radio station in Omaha, Nebraska.
Speaker 1: And what was, what was the name of (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) KOWH [KOWH Radio, Omaha, Nebraska].  It has been put together and purchased by a group of Omaha activists and high achievers, basketball, football, baseball players, the Bob Gibsons, Bob Boozers.  I was working for the Ford Foundation [New York, New York] in a program called Project Equality during the time, right after the riots.  The Ford Foundation gave out grants to get minorities to go into business and particularly, African Americans and then women.  And although it wasn't my division, I was in the EEO [equal employment opportunity] division of the Ford Foundation, the funded program known as Project Equality.  I was the only person they knew.  And so you called the only person you know and say, what division is giving out the grants?  We want some money to buy a black radio station.  Well, that was music to my ears, because I'd been trying to get into radio since I was eight years old.  And my mother [HistoryMaker Helen Jones Woods] bought me a transistor radio that must have weighed fifteen pounds.  They stupidly had put the antenna in the handle, so you're carrying the transistor radio that needs to pick up the signal, and you're blocking the signal (laughter), 'cause you're carrying it by the handle.  And I used to get beat terribly, 'cause I'd stay up all night long, listening to 'Randy's Record Shack' and Wolfman Jack.  Their signals would float in and out.  I'm in Omaha, Nebraska, so they got me listening to Ricky Nelson and Conway Twitty.  And here's this new thing, black radio.  I didn't know back then that these were white guys impersonating air personalities, and as a young child, I had visions of being the first African American woman on the radio.  Little did I know that Hattie McDaniels [Hattie McDaniel], after she won the first Academy Award [Oscar], had also become the first African American ever to have a syndicated radio show.  So I was about twenty years behind schedule at birth.  Hattie McDaniels had been there, done that.
Story_ID: 319962
Speaker 1: Okay, I was asking what you learned.
Speaker 2: I learned so much at Howard University [Washington, D.C.], and they were really supportive of my learning.  They sent me to Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts].  At that time, Harvard did a six-week broadcast management course.  And there were two African Americans in the class, a gentleman by the name of Taber Bolden [Joseph Taber "Bud" Bolden, III] who was then the general manager of the NBC television station in D.C. [Washington, D.C.], and myself, and we came out number one and two in the class.  Years later, when--shortly before I created the Quiet Storm, and the reason I was able to create the Quiet Storm was because Howard, again, paid my tuition and allowed me to go to the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois] to study psychographic programming which basically is programming a radio station to a listener's lifestyle.  They use it for TV now, cable and everything--
Story_ID: 319963
Speaker 1: More importantly than their investment in me, going off to various schools to learn the skills of my craft, the thing that even though I had to struggle with General Davison [Frederic E. Davison] and my subsequent supervisor, I had a certain level of autonomy because they didn't understand the radio station [WHUR Radio, Washington, D.C.].  I had a certain level of implied independence that really allowed me the freedom to do some creative things that were the best learning experiences for me, that I then--once I went into business for myself, I had already made the mistakes on someone else's dime.  Thank God, Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] gave me that opportunity, and during this time, as I said earlier, we were subsidized by the federal government.  So, whether I would win, lose or draw, it was not going to adversely affect Howard's bottom line, because we had no bottom line.  We were funded by the government.  And so I had the freedom, the flexibility, the ability to do certain things that under normal circumstances--and I don't care how much, quote book learning or classroom learning you get, practical application is the best.  That's the reason I believe in internships.  I believe in on-job training.  You can sit in a classroom until you're 110 years old, but it's not until your first day on that real job and that real world that you're faced with decisions, that you're faced with problem--and solutions to those problems that everything you learn really comes into play.  And so much of what I had to do at Howard, I had to figure out on my own.  I didn't have any mentors.  And I'm the first woman general manager of a facility in D.C. [Washington, D.C.].  I didn't have anybody I could go to.  Some of the men that I went to actually said to me, "I don't think that women are best suited for management in the broadcasting industry."  The reason, as a child that I wanted to be the first woman on radio and did not realize that Hattie McDaniels [Hattie McDaniel] had already been there, done that, after she won the--had been the first to win an Academy Award [Oscar], was--women weren't allowed on the microphone, women weren't in radio.  Blacks weren't in radio.  There were white imitators of black disc jockeys in the radio industry.  And so this was all new, virgin territory.  And Howard University really gave me the opportunity to spread my wings, and if I could conceive it and believe it, I could achieve it.  It was just a matter of going through the political maneuvers that I had to, to satisfy my supervisors.  But as the great book, 'The Art of War' [Sun Tzu], says, "That which does not destroy you, makes you stronger."  So even though when I was going through it, I thought, oh, my goodness, this is so challenging.  This is so hard, this is so traumatic: it made me strong.  It taught me the lessons that I needed to know so that when I went through the serious trials or tribulations of trying to establish and run my own businesses, when I did have bottom line responsibility, and guess what?  That bottom line was my pocket book.  I knew a lot more about what I was doing--although I still had a lot to learn, I knew a lot more than I would have known had it not been for Howard University.  So I thank God, and I thank Howard University for the opportunity.  They probably spent more time educating and working with me than they have spent with some of their students in their student body.  And so, although it's called an honorary doctorate that I'll receive later this summer, they really need to give themselves one because they really did educate and prepare me, and I'm thankful for that.
Story_ID: 319964
Speaker 1: When you left [WHUR Radio, Washington, D.C.] then, you went where?  You went to another--
Speaker 2: I went to a group called the Washington Area Broadcasters [Washington Area Broadcasters Association].  They had been together for twelve years.  The signal that they were trying to get on the air was dark.  It was not even on the air, and they had gone through millions of dollars.  They were thirty-six of the most influential black and white members of the Washington, D.C. society.  Todd Duncan, who had been the first Porgy in 'Porgy and Bess' [George Gershwin].  Drew Pearson, one of the greatest journalists ever to have lived, this group of distinguished--and it was African Americans and, and white Washingtonians.  It was kind of an experiment in black folks and white folks doing an entrepreneurial venture that they felt also would have a very meaningful community significance and relevance together, because Washington, D.C. surprised me on how segregated a community it was when I arrived here.  I'm from the Midwest, and even though the Midwest has so many similarities to the Deep South, when you battle nature, when your car is broken down, and it's twenty degrees below zero, and you are twenty-five miles away from the nearest service station, even though you may be the Grand Potentate of the KKK [Ku Klux Klan], if somebody black shows up to help you, you're gone say, "How you doing, brother?"  Even if you're the most militant member of the Black Panther Party, and you're stranded on that dark road in the extreme conditions that we have in the Midwest, a tornado is getting ready to zap you and your family up outta that house, you don't care so--who it is that comes to rescue you.  So there's a different level of unity and cohesiveness.  Although you got the Klan and you got the Panthers, and you got these separatists philosophies and mentalities in the Midwest, Mother Nature, numerous times during any given year in the Midwest will see to it that black folks and white folks work in peaceful harmony in the Midwest.  Not so in Washington, D.C.  There were so few occasions for black folks and white folks to interact on anything in Washington, D.C.  You go to a black affair, there'd be the same two white folks that you saw at every black affair, who thought they were black.  You go to a white affair, and usually, it was somebody who was on the city council [Council of the District of Columbia], who also would be the same person who was invited to all the white affairs.  You go to a black neighborhood, all black.  Go to a white neighborhood, all white.  Go to a white school, all white.  And it was quite a eye opener for me, because even though I had been the first in certain categories in Omaha [Nebraska], like the first African American to graduate from Duchesne Academy [Duchesne Academy of the Sacred Heart, Omaha, Nebraska], there were a lot of black folks who could also say they were the first doing something.  So there was always this progressive movement.  We had a black bank in Omaha before they had one in D.C.  We had a black radio station, black-owned radio station in Omaha, Nebraska before they had one in Washington, D.C.  And so much of that had to do with the lack of interaction between the black and white communities.  And so I kind of was surprised at that when I moved to Washington, D.C.  Washington, D.C. in my opinion, still has a lot of segregation in its lifestyles, plural, in this--going on right now in this city.  And it's kind of tragic.  You don't see the Black Caucus [Congressional Black Caucus] at--or you'll see two or three of 'em at major Democratic functions.  The Black Caucus will have their Annual Congressional Weekend [sic. Annual Legislative Conference].  White politicians pass through.
Story_ID: 319965
Speaker 1: You said there was a group.
Speaker 2: There's a group [Washington Area Broadcasters Association] that wanted to put a radio station on the air, and so they lured me away from Howard University [Washington, D.C.] with the doubling of my salary, but more importantly, the ability to do everything for this radio station from A to Z.  And I got to name it, pick the staff, pick the format.  And then they ran out of money.  And I've never had a paycheck bounce.  I've never had an employee who could not cash their paycheck.  I've never had taxes that went unpaid.  So I start using my retirement money from Howard University to pay.  And I went through about a quarter of a million dollars, my entire life savings.  And then they didn't wanna put any more money in the station.  So, they told me they wanted me to package and go shop a loan for them.  And I was like, that's not what a general manager does.  That's what an owner does.  I said, so, if you all think that I can do this for you, then--and I've already invested.  You already owe me a quarter of a million dollars, then you should give me an equity position.  Well, they went off.  Number one, they'd been fussing and fighting all these years with each other, disappointed.  I've got the station on the air.  They're all trying to be programmers, telling me how to run it.  And so one word led to another.  I was in a board meeting, and so I said to them that either they give me an equity position or I left.  And they said, good-bye.  And so I resigned on the spot, and different than Howard.  When I left Howard University, I couldn't listen to the radio station [WHUR Radio, Washington, D.C.].  I didn't even want people to use H, words that began with H.  Any H word just brought me great pain and misery.  I missed them so terribly, even though I had left on my own.  I still missed them.  I was, you know, there was like something had been torn out of me.  When I left WYCB [WYCB Radio, Washington, D.C.], I was skipping and jumping and smiling.  I was so happy because what I was saying to myself--because I really respect--these were my elders.  These were people who had accomplished great things in their life.  These were high achievers.  If they had enough confidence in me to think that I could go get them a multi-million dollar loan, hello.  I'm gone go get one for myself.  I need to have more confidence in me.  And so I was looking forward to an opportunity of putting together a package for myself and going to get my own radio station.  I never got my money back.  I ended up getting maybe $100,000 of it back, never got all of my money back from them.  Twenty years later--and the station went through several bankruptcies, general managers, was topsy-turvy.  The station was twenty years old, and it was my birthday.  And my son [HistoryMaker Alfred Liggins, III] walked into my office and he said, "I have a special birthday present for you this year."  And I said, "Really?"  And he tossed on my desk the purchase agreement for WYCB, the radio station which is now in the Radio One [Lanham, Maryland] family, doing excellent, excellent, excellent.  It's still twenty-four-hour gospel.  I'm just so proud of it.  But it took it twenty years for me to get my baby back.  It was as if--I view my radio stations, and my staff, as my children.  And it was as if someone had kidnapped one of my babies, and it was returned, and YCB is doing great.
Story_ID: 319966
Speaker 1: So I left YCB [WYCB Radio, Washington, D.C.], and during the same time, Benjamin Hooks [HistoryMaker Reverend Benjamin Hooks] was commissioner, Dr. Benjamin Hooks was Dr. Commissioner Benjamin Hooks, the first African American to serve on the Federal Communications Commission [FCC].  And he had gotten an FCC policy called the distress sale policy through.  And the distress sale policy basically said that if your facility was in trouble with the Federal Communications Commission and in danger of you losing its license--prior to the distress sale policy, if you got in trouble, they would just take your license.  They would just take our license.  They would just shut you down.  They didn't do it frequently, but they had the power to do it.  So if you took your license, discounted it by one third of its fair-market value--you had an appraiser come out, appraise the property, discounted and only accept sixty-six and two thirds percent from a woman or from a minority, you could sell the license, so at least you came out--two thirds of the pie was better than, you know, no pie.  And so the policy had just gone into effect.  And lo and behold, the first distress sale station was in Washington, D.C.  And it was WOL [WOL Radio, Washington, D.C.], and the staff had been found guilty, as well as the owner, of accepting payola.  And the FCC would have normally lifted their license, 'cause they went to court, some people went to jail or one gentleman was literally executed, hands tied behind him, shot through the head and dumped on the interstate in the middle of rush-hour traffic, thrown from a car.  And so the FCC--that's what really triggered the investigation.  His name was Soul Papa [R. Seavy].  And Soul Papa left WOL; his wife was in the parking lot, and these two white guys came up and told his wife to go on home, and that Soul Papa was going with them.  Within the hour, with his hands tied behind him, and a bullet through his head, he was thrown on 495 [Interstate 495], which is our major loop which surrounds Washington, D.C.  The FCC was on the news that night saying, "We think we have a problem," (laughter).  And everybody in the country was like, "Yeah, we think you do too.  You've got some serious payola going on." Because oftentimes in radio, if you accept the money and didn't do what they said they, you were going--didn't do what you said you were gonna do for record executives, you would get hurt.  So anyway, Soul Papa got executed.  The FCC initiated this big payola investigation, and the station was going down.  And over a hundred individuals, including then Senator Edward Brooke [HistoryMaker Edward Brooke], and the most famous, popular man in the whole wide world at the time, Muhammad Ali, all these distinguished individuals wanted the station because it was in Washington, D.C.  It was a low-power, thousand-watt station, but it was in Washington, D.C., the media capital of the world.  What a distinction, what an honor to have this station and get it at a one-third, discounted price.
Story_ID: 319967
Speaker 1: I went to work.  I'm putting together a package, I thought.  And during this time, I'm dating an individual who by this time is in television and has fourteen Emmys [Emmy Awards] to his credit.  But he had started out in radio.  Dewey Hughes, when he had gotten out of the service, had come into WOL [WOL Radio, Washington, D.C.]--it was the name, is the name of the station, as an intern, although he calls it a full-time flunky.   He wanted to learn media.  He wanted to learn radio.  So he did everything.  And Dewey is, to this day, the most organized person I know.  He takes notes.  He--his files, his closet, everything about him is just totally organized.  One of the reasons that we didn't stay together too long 'cause I don't have that personality (laughter), and he was always like, "Get more organized."  But thank God, he was organized, took just impeccable notes on everything he was learning at the radio station.  So there was a challenge the license, way before the payola and the distress sale, some twenty years before.  It was while Dewey was interning.  Well, everything he heard, everything he saw, everything he did, he kept a journal.  So when the FCC [Federal Communications Commission] challenged the station some twenty years before, it was this really serious trouble, it was Dewey's diary that saved the station's license.  Well, the owner of the station was a Polish immigrant who arrived at Ellis Island [New York, New York] with thirteen cents in his pocket.  And he was big on the Horatio Alger story because he had been Horatio Alger.  He had arrived with thirteen cents and now was a multi-millionaire.  He was also very big on loyalty.  And Dewey had saved his neck at a critical time during his development, 'cause twenty years later, he was a lot richer then than he had been during this first challenge.  Dewey had come forth with his diaries and the only thing Dewey wanted in exchange for all this information that he had documented--with no hidden agenda, 'cause he wasn't even an employee, he was just somebody in there trying to learn radio--was a job.  And so they had given him a job.  He had worked, made a big success of his division.  He did public affairs for the radio station during the riots.  He really helped put this radio station on the map; had gotten 'em out of trouble, had put them on the map, and he came to Egmont Sonderling and said, "My wife and I would like to buy the station."  And so Egmont said, "Oh, Dewey, how are you going to get enough money to buy the station?  I would sell you the station tomorrow.  I owe it to you, but, Dewey, Dewey, even with the discount, we're talking about $1.5 million.  How could you possibly afford that?"  And Dewey said that he started to say to him, "You don't know my wife."  But instead, he said, "Mr. Sonderling, you let me worry about that.  You just worry about giving me the deal."  And so it was announced that Dewey and I would be allowed to buy the station.
Story_ID: 319968
Speaker 1: Well, Mr. Sonderling [Egmont Sonderling] was a very honorable, loyal person.  The people around him were not.  And some of his lawyers and some other family members who will go unmentioned, although they are now no longer alive, God rest their souls, but they came to Dewey [Dewey Hughes], and they said to Dewey that we have more influence with him than anybody and if you don't give us $100,000, then you're not gonna get the deal.  And Dewey is a very principled individual, and he said, "No, I'm not giving you any money under the table."  And so they then, because the lawyers were involved, went and drafted legal documents that required us to have a $100,000 additional deposit with them within forty-eight hours.  That was our punishment for not playing ball with them.  And we had forty-eight hours to come up with a hundred thousand dollars.  We already had our down payment.  Every penny I had in the world, everything I could beg, borrow and steal and thank God for [HistoryMaker] Ofield Dukes 'cause he was out getting people, investors.  I ended up with nine investors, eleven total in the end analysis, 'cause a couple people brought their sons, and they all put in ten thousand [dollars] here, twenty thousand [dollars] there.  All of that money was already on deposit, and they asked for an additional hundred thousand dollars because they were so mad.  And it was gonna blow our deal.  And they had already talked to some other buyers who had said, "Oh, it's no problem.  We'll be happy to do it on the side for you," to get the deal.  Dewey went to Egmont.  He refused to believe it.  He was like, "Oh, no, Dewey.  That could not be the truth.  You know, I've been with these people all these years."  So anyway, Dewey grew up in Washington, D.C. with two gentlemen who became two of the greatest vocalists ever alive.  One's name was Billy Stewart who had a big hit called 'Summertime.'  Another's name is Herb Fame of Peaches and Herb.  And Peaches and Herb were riding a high tide.  I tell this joke.  I tell Herb that he's had so many Peaches that he needs to change the name of the group to Herb and the Orchard, all right.  So here he comes in, and the Peaches at that time was Linda Greene.  And they had 'Shake Your Groove Thing' and 'Reunited' and it was number one in, both of 'em, back-to-back, boom.  And he comes running into our apartment with an $800,000 check to show his best buddy, Dewey Hughes--he had just gotten his royalty check for 'Shake Your Grove Thing' and 'Reunited.'  And Dewey to this day, said that I looked like a wolf, who had seen (laughter) a piece of red meat (laughter).  He said that my eyes were just whoa, okay.  I knew it was God, all right.  Who else, I mean never again, never before has anyone walked through my door waving an $800,000 check.  So I was like, "Excuse me, Herb.  Could I have a word with you?"  I'm like, "Dewey, you and I need to talk to Herb."  So I was like, "Herb, we've got twenty-four hours--," by now 'cause a day has passed, all right.  And Dewey and I just knew we weren't gonna get the deal.  We had just, all right, said, "Hey, we were praying, but, you know, I mean this was a miracle that's taking place.  We need $100,000.  We need to borrow it for thirty days, because the banks had already told us that they would give us the additional hundred thousand dollars, but they couldn't do it in forty-eight hours.  Thirty days, you'll have your money back."  And Herb looked at us, and we told him it's for--we were buying WOL [WOL Radio, Washington, D.C.].  He was very familiar with WOL.  He's from D.C.  He said, "I gotta go home and talk to my wife, Yvonne [Yvonne Feemster]."  He went home.  Yvonne said yes."  And then they approached Peaches and her husband who was also their manager and said, "Why don't you put up fifty, we'll put up fifty [$50,000]." And they all four, said yes, brought me the hundred thousand dollars, went to the bank, cashed their $800,000 check, gave me a hundred thousand dollars.  And within hours of me losing the deal, I went in and gave them the additional hundred thousand dollars.  They were stunned.  Then the bank start realizing how hot this property was.  I got the loan done in like two weeks.  So I went to Herb and Peaches and their mates, and I said, "Here's your $100,000.  How much interest do we owe you?" And they said, "Nothing.  We're so happy that we have helped you buy this station."  I said, "Well, please consider putting the hundred thousand dollars into stock in the company or letting me give you some stock."  Herb and Linda and Yvonne and Paul Cohen [ph.] was the husband, they were all four adamant.  They said, "We're so impressed that you come back to us in two weeks, bring us our hundred thousand dollars, we wanna see you and Dewey--we love Dewey.  We respect you.  We don't want any stock."  They now, every time I see 'em, they're like, "Where's our stock?  Where's that stock you said--(laughter)," all right, (unclear).  "All right, it was a one-time deal.  You said, no (laughter), okay."  They're like, "Were we stupid?"  That hundred thousand dollars when we went public probably would have been worth about, probably about ten million dollars to them, right.  Yeah.  So Peaches and Herb saved our deal.
Story_ID: 319969
Speaker 1: We got the radio station [WOL Radio, Washington, D.C.], and because the staff all had to be let go--part of a distress sale is you can't keep the staff, 'cause they're the ones who did wrong.  And so the staff's mad at us.  Some of them were still at the station from the days of Dewey [Dewey Hughes] being there, being a manager.  So they're like, "Dewey's our man.  I know he's gonna be able to get around the rule and keep us--," and blah, blah, blah.  And now, they don't like me to begin with because, remember, I've been the general manager of WHUR [WHUR Radio, Washington, D.C.].  I've created the Quiet Storm, which was part of their demise.  One of the reasons they were on the take was 'cause I was whipping their butts so badly with my FM signal, 'cause FM now is coming into its own, okay.  So that night, they backed the truck up.  The night we're gonna take over--we take over at midnight.  Most stations transfer hands at twelve noon or midnight.  Twelve-o-one [12:01], the air personality on duty, the last one, hands us the keys and he drops his head and walks out.  He had been one of the ones that had been there since the days of Dewey Hughes working there.  And he vanishes, just gone.  You know, we had thought he'd say congratulations, and we walked in, and it was a war zone.  Everything that they hadn't removed, they had destroyed.  We didn't even have one record to play.  The only record in the whole station was the one that was on the turntable when he walked out the door.  There was not a pen.  There was not a scrap of paper.  There were no records.  There was absolutely nothing in the radio station.  And the record is running out.  So Dewey shows me how to keep the record going, and I just kept playing it over and over.  He hops in the car.  He runs home and grabs our personal collection of LPs and runs back to the radio station.  And we had brought a bottle of Dom [Dom Perignon].  We had a bucket of fried chicken, and we sat there and ate fried chicken and toasted with our bottle of Dom and thanked the Lord for what we knew was going to be a glorious future.

Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So, the very next morning, we're still at the station [WOL Radio, Washington, D.C.].  We've been there all night long.  The place is like a disaster area.  And this woman walks in that I had never seen before, an elderly woman, very well dressed, very nattily dressed, and she says, "My name is Reverend Mozelle J. Fuller.  And I have done a fifteen-minute Sunday gospel show on this station for the last twenty-six years.  And God sent me here this morning to take your hand."  And she fell down to her knees and pulled me down to her knees and for the next fifteen, twenty minutes, she did not talk to God; she screamed at God, "Dear God, we need you now.  We need you right now."  And she insisted that God descend upon my business.  She insisted that God take me into the Creator's loving, protective care.  And she established that day with me down on my knees--and Dewey [Dewey Hughes] hears all this screaming going on in the lobby.  And he comes, and he's just standing there like he's frozen, watching this.  And she established what she called the WOL prayer circle.  And she said, "This prayer circle is going to encircle this woman and this company--," and what was so interesting, remember now, I'm married at this time.  And she just leaves him standing there, all right.  So she had the vision that it was going to be me.  "And you protect her and you encircle her and you get the devils and the negative spirits outta here, and if she will have me, dear God, I will be her chaplain, and we will sing your praises every day.  We will tell the world that we are your servants."  And she just went on and on and on.  And I'm like in shock.  I don't know who she is.  I've never quite had a prayer meeting on my knees in the middle of my less than twenty-four hour business venture.  And to this day, those prayers have been answered.  That circle has been around me, and when we had the first war, and General Colin Powell [HistoryMaker General Colin L. Powell] told President Bush, Sr. [President George Herbert Walker Bush] that he didn't think it was a good idea, Reverend Fuller called me and she said, "Sista Cathy [HistoryMaker Cathy Hughes], we gotta get our prayer warriors together, that prayer circle.  Call your church and see can we--," 'cause she was an evangelist.  She didn't have a church, "Call your church and see can we meet there, 'cause you know I don't have a church for us to meet in.  And I need to have a hundred prayer warriors.  So tomorrow morning on the air, I need for us to ask a hundred prayer warriors to come and meet us at your church."  So I called the church.  They said yes.  And the next morning, she comes on my air with me.  She petitions the audience for a hundred people, a hundred prayer warriors to come.  And that night, exactly one hundred people showed up at the church, and the war lasted one hundred days.  And her insistence, once again, to God was that the war would be no longer than every one of those people represented in that church.  And I already was a believer from the first day that she had fallen on her knees, but after I saw her bring that first war to an end in a hundred days, with those one hundred prayer warriors, there was nothing you could say to me that, that--I knew Reverend Fuller was an angel--
Story_ID: 318013
Speaker 1: I knew that she [Reverend Mozelle J. Fuller] was one of God's messengers.  And I knew that as long as I believed, and I learned from her the power of prayer.  And I learned from her the leaving and the Creator and accepting the will of the Creator.  And when that war ended in a hundred days, I was on the air [at WOL Radio, Washington, D.C.].  My audience will tell you.  We were like tripped out.  We were like, "She said it.  She said it." She asked God, she insisted because when Reverend Fuller would pray, we--the joke around the city would be that she prayed the roof off the top of the building.  She didn't like talk to God, "Oh, dear God, please hear my prayers."  She'd be like, (shouting) "Do yah hear me, Lord?  Do yah hear what I'm saying?  I need it now, God, I need it right now."  We're like, "Is that how you're supposed to talk to God?"  God responded, and Reverend Mozelle J. Fuller was a special guardian angel of Radio One [Lanham, Maryland].  And on her death bed, she had so many people that she had helped, so many people were fond of her.  And she was very, very sick in the end.  And so she and her family requested that people not come see her.  And one day, her family called and said that she needed to see me, that she needed to have a prayer session with me.  And her last prayer was that the good Lord would send as many guardian angels to watch over me and Radio One as necessary because she was going home.  She was leaving me and that she no longer could look out for me, and she no longer could pray for me, but that there would be people whose names I didn't know.  There would be people who I didn't even know existed and that they would pray for me and that they would keep me in God's protective care. I can't tell you how frequently we're confronted with something and I just ask the good Lord to hear the prayer of his servants.  And we get through--we were going public in September of 1998.  And something just said, no, inside of me.  I was uncomfortable going public to begin with, which is a story I'll share with you.  But then Alfred [Hughes' son, HistoryMaker Alfred Liggins, III] started getting uncomfortable.  And at the last minute, we bailed.  And the bankers, the lawyers, the accountants, everyone said, "You just can't change your mind."  We're like, "No, we're not going public."  September, 1998 ended up being the worst year for public offerings in the forty-year history, in the last forty years of the U.S. stock market, the very worst month.  And something just told us--and it cost us several hundreds of thousands of dollars, because we had to do everything over.  We went public in May of 1999.  But one of the things that--I couldn't say to my bankers and to my lawyers, is I heard Reverend Fuller in my head saying, "No, baby, that's not--no, baby, don't do that, no."  And like I said, Reverend Fuller didn't pray modest, soft kind of--she was like, (shouting) "No, do you hear me?"  I said, "No.  We're not going public."  So, you can't tell your banker that the voice of your dead chaplain is playing in your head (laughter), telling you, no, because they don't understand that it's the voice of God, that God has ways of communicating with you.  Jamie Foxx said it.  Jamie Foxx said, "I talk to my grandmamma now.  I just talk to her in my dreams, and I got a lot to talk to her about tonight."  But that's the voice of God; that's the voice of angels.  And Mozelle J. Fuller made such a difference, because she made me understand the power of prayer.  And that's how we've been able to survive and prevail.  And she made me realize that that's how I had gotten Alfred grown.  It's how I lived my entire life.  But I hadn't taken it as seriously as I started once she came into my life.  She stayed with me the first ten years of the station's existence.  And then she died, and she offered her last prayer, that her responsibility for me would be turned over to others.  And that day in the station, she was telling God, "I knew, I heard you, Lord, when you told me that you were sending me somebody to look out after--," I'm thinking, this is a nut case, all right.  She's saying that God sent her here to--that she been waiting twenty-six years at this radio station--when she died, she had been on the air thirty-seven years at the same station, paying 'em every week, paying 'em every week.  And I was like, "No, Reverend Fuller.  You do enough.  You can't pay me.  You're--."  "Oh, no, baby, you need the money.  You need the money," all right.  "Don't tell Reverend Fuller what to do with her money now.  I'm paying you for this time."  She was just absolutely incredible.
Story_ID: 318014
Speaker 1: Seven years, the station [WOL Radio, Washington, D.C.] was in the red.  For seven years, this friend of mine who had helped me get my first loan, who had taken me to Syndicated Communications [Syndicated Communications, Inc. (Syncom)], Herb Wilkins [HistoryMaker Herbert P. Wilkins, Sr.] and [HistoryMaker] Terry Jones.  His name is Skip Finley.  He was the first African American to ever head a network.  And he had taken me to Syncom to get a loan.  And we were sitting there, making the presentation, and they said, "Okay, what about your business plan?"  I said, "Oh, my plan is to succeed in business."  I didn't know what a business plan was, because I had never been an entrepreneur.  They died laughing.  They laughed me up outta there.  So Skip Finley sat me down, helped me develop and write a business plan.  And in exchange for that, I gave him 5 percent of my company [Radio One, Lanham, Maryland].  When Alfred [Hughes' son, HistoryMaker Alfred Liggins, III] turned twenty-one, Skip Finley just so graciously, so generously, gave Alfred that 5 percent in the company, saying, "Your mother needs you.  And I think that if you have a vested interest in this company, that you will view it differently."  Most people think that Alfred quote inherited his position in my company.  Not true.  His first ownership position came from Skip Finley.  And Skip Finley said, "If you own part of it, you'll work harder, young man."  He also teases me like Herb Fame.  He's like, "Was I drinking that night?  Was I on drugs?  Why didn't you stop me, Cathy [HistoryMaker Cathy Hughes]?  Now, you're supposed--I've been a good friend to you.  Why couldn't you be a good friend to me that night and say, shut up, Skip.  Give him a gift.  Okay, don't give him your stock for his twenty-first birthday."  He gave him that 5 percent stake in the station and said, "Now, it's yours.  Let me see what you gone do with it, young man."  And Alfred hasn't looked back since.  But Syndicated Communications, I have to also say, made such an incredible difference in my life, because they taught me how to be an entrepreneur.
Story_ID: 318015
Speaker 1: Herb Wilkins [HistoryMaker Herbert P. Wilkins, Sr.] also, he and my mother [HistoryMaker Helen Jones Woods] were cut from the same bolt of cloth.  He practices tough love.  He can be a gorilla when he wants to be.  He would keep me in tears.  When I was at my lowest, when I had lost everything--I had lost Dewey [Dewey Hughes].  We had gotten a divorce.  He had moved to California.  I'd lost Alfred [Hughes' son, HistoryMaker Alfred Liggins, III], although it was to college.  He had gone off to college, but I--they had repossessed my car. I'm sleeping in my radio station [WOL Radio, Washington, D.C.] in a sleeping bag, washing up in the public bathroom, and Herb Wilkins goes to a formal affair that gets out at two o'clock in the morning, and he makes himself, his wife [Sheran R. Wilkins], [HistoryMaker] Terry Jones and Terry Jones' wife, Marcella [Marcella Jones], come to the station to see is it true that their quote, crazy general manager and owner was sleeping in a sleeping bag.  So here I go to the door.  There's this banging at my radio station door.  I got pin curls and a nightgown on.  I'm thinking it's one of my listeners in distress or the police or the fire department telling me the building's on fire, and it's Herb making a light--a late-night credit call.  I'm like, do bankers come at two o'clock in the morning in tuxedos?  And I'm standing there, and he's like, "Why are you standing there in your nightgown with rollers in your head?"  And I said, "They're pin curls.  They're not rollers, and because I'm sleeping here."  "You've living here, aren't you?  I heard rumors you were living here.  You can't live in your business.  This isn't a grocery store."  I said, "No, sir.  I just spent the night here so I could be on time in the morning.  I had a late night."  And so he said, "You sure you not living here?"  I said, "No."  "You wouldn't lie to me, right?"  I said, "I would not lie to you.  I am not living here."  And I later told him, I didn't consider it living, so I didn't think I was lying (laughter), okay.  And, but I realized that he was just keeping me on the--'cause it was so unusual, 'cause he never went and looked.  If he had a gone in the back, he would have seen everything I possessed in the world.  He would a known I was living there.  And then he stormed out.  I went back in my little sleeping bag and cried myself to sleep.  I was terrified.  But that night, I made up my mind that if he ever tried to foreclose, I was gonna blockade that front door.  I was gonna be (laughter)--it was gonna my fort.  I was gonna padlock myself in.  They would never take me alive (laughter).  I was gonna go down with the ship.  And that may have been the reason that he did that late night credit raid, as he later called it.  He told me that he never foreclosed on me because anybody that was that determined, he said, that night, you were truly a pitiful sight standing there with those rollers in your head.  I said, "They were not rollers.  They were pin curls."  He said, "Same difference."  He said, "You were such a pitiful sight that all the way home, I kept saying to my wife, 'She is going to make it, because she is bound and determined, nothing is going to stop her,'" he said, because he really didn't believe I was living in the station when people were telling him that.  During this time, now people wanna write about it and talk about it.  They were calling me crazy.  They were calling me neurotic.  They were telling my mother I had had a nervous breakdown.  My mother, who normally believes, you make your bed, you sleep in it, sent me $5,000 with a note, saying they now make pre-fab [pre-fabricated] bathrooms.  Get yourself a toilet, a tub and a shower and a sink that is not public domain.  And stop--'cause, I mean, it got embarrassing.  Some days I'd be rushing.  I'd leave my panties in the bathroom, and the staff would be coming out (laughter), waving a bra (laughter), okay.  And at first, they don't know I'm living there, 'cause I'm not, you know, sharing that with them.  They just thinking I'm getting to work early in the morning, okay.  They're like, well, we have sex in the bathroom.  Someone lost their bra.  They're thinking it's funny.  And I'm snatching their--we'll have to find out who this belongs to, you know.  I'm stuffing it in my pocket and everything.  So my mother is getting all these stories back in Omaha [Nebraska], because every night I go to a friend's house to take a shower.  And I'm thinking that she's befriending me, and instead, she's telling everybody in Omaha that they need to come get me, that I've lost my mind, blah, blah, blah.  Long story short, my mother sends me $5,000 with this ad for a pre-fab bathroom.  They just drop the whole thing in, okay, countertops and everything.  But the pre-fab bathroom costs $5,000.  I didn't have any money for installation, and this black plumber came to--someone had recommended him.  And so I said, "Well, I'm gonna have to wait, because I don't have the installation money."  And he wouldn't accept any money to install it.  He put it in for me, and not only did he do that, but he did a kitchenette.  So I went from cooking on a hot plate to a two-burner stove, and a little refrigerator like they have in New York [New York] in those walk-ups, those little efficiency, they--they're connected to each other, the stove and the refrigerator are connected.  He installed one of those.  So I had an apartment in Georgetown [Washington, D.C.].  And I didn't see it with the strangeness and the adversity and the hardship that other people were viewing it.  And so many people were so kind.  They were so gracious.  They were so willing to help, including Herb and Terry.
Story_ID: 318016
Speaker 1: So seven years passed, and I get a financial statement every day.  I'm doing my morning show.  I'm running the station [WOL Radio, Washington, D.C.].  I'm doing fifteen different jobs.  Alfred [Hughes' son, HistoryMaker Alfred Liggins, III] drops out of college, comes home.  He and I have what we call a hit list on Thursday.  We divide up a list of clients who owe us money.  We go out and collect.  We take the cash to the bank so we can issue paychecks on Friday afternoon and know they don't bounce.  So, one of the things that the banks and the lenders are constantly concerned about is the inconsistency in my bookkeeping methodology, because I'm having to do the books myself and then a consultant would come in.  They'll say do it this way.  It's hard for entrepreneurs.  This is what my father's [William A. Woods] business was supposed to be.  And, you know, I report something on an accrual basis one month or two months, and then I would change it.  And I didn't know what to put under capital expenditures.  So I finally hire an accountant.
Story_ID: 318017
Speaker 1: Finally I find an accountant that I can afford.  He's basically doing it for next to nothing for me to help me get established and my financial statements are consistent.  They're in the form that make my lenders comfortable, and everything's going along fine.  And I get a statement, a monthly statement, and there're no brackets around my bottom line.  And it's not in red ink.  And I call him up and just go off.  I'm like, "I can't go this again with my lenders.  You cannot make a mistake."  And he start laughing.  He said, "It's no mistake.  You made a profit this month."  And I just could not believe it.  It had been seven years.  And so now, once again, we were creditworthy, because what all my lenders had said was that I could not borrow any money to buy another station until I turned this one [WOL Radio, Washington, D.C.] around, until I made some money with this one.  And finally, I was in that position.
Story_ID: 318018
Speaker 1: There was a station for sale, an FM.  And the lender was--the seller was playing all types of games with us.  He kept going up on the price.  He went up with the price, and it--the company was--he was the general manager; the president actually, president and general manager of the company--it was actually a publicly-traded company.  So we went to the largest stockholder and told him every time we come back, he claims there's somebody bidding against us.  The price goes up.  Can you help us?  And he says, "I don't get involved.  I'm just a stockholder." But he did get involved.  And so they sealed the price.  We're going to closing with a D.C. [Washington, D.C.] bank, and all of a sudden the bank announces that they'll only give us the loan if they--if we agree that, to their terms.  And their terms were that I could not put my talk show on the FM.  Now, the only reason I really wanted the FM, Alfred [Hughes' son, HistoryMaker Alfred Liggins, III] was already sophisticated and advanced enough in business to understand that had we not gotten that FM, it would have been all over for us.  We would not have been able to survive.  But I was happy, doing my morning talk show, and when I had hot topics, listeners would brag about, they would come into their office early so they could hear my little weak signal [WOL Radio, Washington, D.C.].  And it was like a joke because although I had this weak signal, I was the number one talk show in Washington, D.C.  Everybody was listening.  So this FM station would give me an opportunity to reach the suburbs, to reach millions of people instead of hundreds of thousands.  The bank said I couldn't do it.  So I walked out on the closing.  My son runs down the hallway with tears in his eyes.  He grabs me, and he says, "You have to sign these papers.  We will not survive.  We will not have a company if we do not get an FM partner for our AM mother.  AM is passe.  We have to have--," what was then called a combo.  And I was like, "No, because they said I can't do my show."  And he pulled an ace out of his pocket.  He said, "You have always said that all of this was about my future and about my life.  So do it for me."  So I turned around, and I went it and I signed the papers.  And that, I feel, was the demise of my professional career.  Signing those papers took all the joy out of everything I had done in broadcasting.  My show was that important to me.  And before I signed it, I prayed, and I said to God, "Do I sign these papers and disrupt my career for him, or do I really look out for myself?"  And I signed the papers.  And one of the reasons that Alfred now is so enthusiastic about me learning cable and the opportunity that TV One [Silver Spring, Maryland] is affording me, it's like make up because I haven't been shy about the fact that I would have been Oprah [Oprah Winfrey].  I would have been Tom Joyner.  I would have been so many others that I was doing it before--I would have been bigger than Howard Stern.  I would have done, in media, what other people after me did, but that day, when I signed those papers and agreed to the terms, was when I no longer had the desire to do my show; didn't lose the enthusiasm for the business aspect, but lost the enthusiasm.  And as I shared with you, that's really what I'm best at.  I'm good at the business.  It's second nature.  My [maternal] granddaddy [Laurence C. Jones] and my daddy [William A. Woods] trained me, and they were consummate business people.  I know business second nature.  It's the creative end that turns me on, that excites me, that really gets my juices flowing, that I feel that is my special gift.  I can count the money.  I now know how to do the bottom line responsibility correctly.
Story_ID: 318019
Speaker 1: We're [Radio One, Lanham, Maryland] considered the best managed broadcast corporation in America today, black or white, bar none or Hispanic.  We are the best, our management team.  And Alfred [Hughes' son, HistoryMaker Alfred Liggins, III] is responsible for the recruiting and management of that team.  And I manage him, so it's a partnership between my son and myself.  And we have the best of the best.  And we work 'em hard, but we try to reward them abundantly.  But my people are good on both the radio and the television, and also the research side.  We are considered the best.  That is exciting to me and fulfilling and gratifying, and that's something that I know is my responsibility.  But that doesn't give me the joy.  The programming gives me, creating opportunities for black folks to feel good about themselves, look good, say, yeah.  I did an interview with Jamie Foxx before he won the Academy Award [Oscar], and for people to say, I just felt good after I watched it.  I watched it two, three times.  That, that's what my satisfaction and my career is about, making people feel good about themselves with me and through me and through the vehicles that God has blessed me to be with.  So Alfred now is forty.  And enough people, including me, have said to him that, you know, your mama (laughter) would have been Oprah [Oprah Winfrey].  You know your mama would have been Tom Joyner.  You know your mama was doing blah, blah, blah.  The television show that Howard Stern does is a show that I did and the same format, cameras in the studio, the whole nine yards.  And when Alfred had become the president of the company, we decided that we wanted to pick up additional radio stations.  So there was not enough money to do the television show.  So, again, I was derailed, and, and do the acquisitions.  So we decided to cancel the television show.  And then when Howard Stern start doing it, Alfred saw him one day and said, "You know you stole that idea from my mama," (laughter).  The cameras in the studio had never been done before.  And it was a concept that, that I was just--I knew it would work.  I knew that--and we were right there on the brink, but couldn't afford to go forward.  And so I always say to people who feel that maybe their dreams haven't been fulfilled the way they want.  Maybe they didn't get what they want at a particular time.  Just be of good spirit and wait on the Lord because it may come around when you least expect because I am as excited about learning cable now and doing TV One, both producing and hosting as I have ever been in my life.
Story_ID: 318020
Speaker 1: And I just pray that the good Lord will bless me with the same creative abilities in television that he did in radio, because Radio One [Lanham, Maryland] is now a $3 billion corporation with over two thousand employees.  We are the only publicly-traded corporation in the United States headed by an African American woman.  And as I've been bragging about, we got the best management team on both the radio side--Radio One actually owns TV One [Silver Spring, Maryland], and on both sides and with Research One [ph.].  I can't say enough about the team that my son [HistoryMaker Alfred Liggins, III] has assembled.  They are the best of the best, but even more importantly, I watch my personal philosophy of each one, teach one, trickle down.  And I watch my veterans teaching young folks and embracing young folks.  I watch executives come into my corporation who have worked in major white corporations for years and just understand instantly, we're community oriented.  So, you gone give up some Saturdays and Sundays, 'cause we got some stuff we gotta be doing out here in the hood.  And it's great that you got rating, and it's great that you're a big celebrity, and it's great that you got all of these wonderful awards and, and, you know, accomplishments.  But that doesn't mean a thing when we go over here to this shelter and do something to try to get some of these brothers and sisters to pull themselves up outta here, because in my opinion, the most important thing a human being can do for another human being is to motivate and inspire them to do it themselves.  The most effective correction to any situation comes from within itself.  And so now, we are the second cable channel in the history of the cable industry.  For twenty-five years, Bob Johnson [Robert L. Johnson], in my opinion, got a bum rap.  Everybody in the black community, including me, raised hell with him about, all you do is play videos.  Well, guess what, hello.  That's what he called his network, entertainment.  He wasn't interested in doing anything but entertaining and quite frankly, now, I understand.  He was brilliant.  He did it the cheapest way.  He had someone else doing all of his programming.  He had no programming costs.  Because of Bob Johnson, record companies started spending millions of dollars doing four-minute videos because they could get 'em aired on BET [Black Entertainment Television].  Bob Johnson didn't keep black folks out of the cable industry.  The cable industry kept black folks out, while at the same time, allowing us to be a majority of their profit margin, and at the same time, allowing Spanish-speaking stations to come in--
Story_ID: 318672
Speaker 1: All right, we bought WOL [WOL Radio] in Washington, D.C.  And then seven and a half years later, we acquired our FM, big sister, to WOL, Majic 102.3 [WMMJ Radio, Washington, D.C.].  Majic 102.3 was Alfred's [Hughes' son, HistoryMaker Alfred Liggins, III] first opportunity to program.  And Alfred created an adult, contemporary format that became so potent that he created his own genre of radio.  He was so determined to show me that he could do a format the same way I had done the Quiet Storm, that what we now know as urban adult contemporary radio started with Majic 102.3.  In radio, the value of your listener to an advertiser is called a power ratio.  A perfect power ratio is 100.  Alfred's power ratio during certain periods of him directly running that radio station was 110.  It is a case history study at Harvard University [Cambridge, Massachusetts].  What he did with that FM was absolutely phenomenal.  I knew I had made the right decision signing those papers that day, and quite frankly, when a mama really loves her child, then you make sacrifices.  Sometimes you have to sacrifice yourself and other--in order for the next generation to do better.
Story_ID: 318673
Speaker 1: After we start succeeding with the AM and F--AM and FM combination in Washington, D.C. (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And what year was that?
Speaker 1: Nineteen eighty-even [1987].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: In the next eighteen months, we ventured into the Baltimore [Maryland] market.  And prior to venturing into the Baltimore market, we had tried to purchase a station from a black owner by the name of Ragan Henry.  And when we went to closing on that facility in Baltimore, Maryland, the bankers changed the terms again on me.  Well, now, I was still stinging from them changing the terms on me, not being able to transfer my radio show from AM to FM.  So when they changed the financial terms, I said, no way.  Well, Alfred [Hughes' son, HistoryMaker Alfred Liggins, III] agreed this time.  And so we walked from the closing.  Twelve months later--in broadcasting when you buy a radio or television station, your down payment is nonrefundable.  That's just the standard way we do business in this industry.  And so we knew we were walking on our down payment.  The seller was an African American by the name of Ragan Henry, who later called us and said, you made the right decision, because the bank was really not doing you justice.  And you did the right thing.  Twelve months later, we came back with a different bank and bought the station and Ragan Henry, on his own, did something that probably has never been done before, particularly, in black radio.  He applied our down payment that we had lost twelve months before, to the purchase price of the property, something he did not have to do, something that was so--and we had no idea, did not tell us.  We go into closing on his properties, and they've applied our down payment to the purchase of the station.  And we are eternally grateful to him for that.  So then we ventured into Baltimore.

Speaker 1: --About this time I start realizing that I'm still signing all these documents.  And I realize that Alfred [Hughes' son, HistoryMaker Alfred Liggins, III] is growing in knowledge, expertise, experience, is doing a very good job of being the manager of my company [Radio One, Lanham, Maryland].  But one of the things that was not taking place was they were not allowing him, the banking industry was not allowing him to be what they call creditworthy.  And I'm like, well, if Alfred is now the president of my company, he's the general manager.  He's running things.  Why am I still having to sign all the loans?  His name should be on the loans with me.  And so I start talking to my lenders about it, and they were like, oh, ah, ah, ah.  And they start speaking Latin.  So I was like, okay.  So we're doing really good.  We're making money.  And they're insisting that we buy some more facilities, because once you start making money, bankers want you to make some more money, 'cause they're making money.  And so I said to them, "I'm not buying another facility until Alfred becomes creditworthy."  So Alfred then was made creditworthy by the lenders, and he bought his first station which was a radio station in Atlanta, Georgia.  And he named it Radio One of Atlanta.  Most people think it was the same company, but it wasn't.  Alfred then had his own company and his own radio station.  It was not until we were going public that Radio One, Inc. bought Radio One of Atlanta, because we could not have this subsidiary, this--a company out that was not a subsidiary that was owned and controlled by the president, then president and CEO of Radio One.  The public market, Wall Street, was not going to go for that.  Alfred had to either dispose of it.  So Radio One bought it and brought it into the fold--
Story_ID: 318675
Speaker 1: But we [Radio One, Lanham, Maryland] started to expand into other markets.  We started to put together other stations.  When we went public, we had twenty-two stations.  We now have seventy-one.  A few years ago, we purchased twelve radio stations from Clear Channel [Clear Channel Communications, Inc.], because they were overpopulated in some of the markets.  Clear Channel, there're only 11,000 radio stations in the entire United States.  Clear Channel owns 1,100.  So, in some of those markets, the government, the FCC [Federal Communications Commission] was making them sell them.  We did a $1.3 billion acquisition from Clear Channel.  It was the largest business deal ever undertaken by an African American company.  The largest to date had been the $1 billion acquisition of Beatrice Foods TLC [Beatrice International Foods] by Reginald Lewis [Reginald F. Lewis] of Baltimore, Maryland.  And it had taken eleven years for the black economic community to get from $1 billion to $1.3 billion, $300 million growth in eleven years.  That's not something that I speak with pride about.  That's terrible.  That's embarrassing.  That's ridiculous.  That's racism in the banking industry at its very worst, eleven years and we only are able to pick up $300 million.  And to date, no one--I encourage businesses when I speak all the time, please, please, break my record.  But when we bought those twelve radio stations at $1.3 billion, it was the largest acquisition in the history of Africans living in America.  We have been doing quite well.  We are number one in several of our markets.  I used to pray to the Lord to allow me to have one thousand black broadcasters on my payroll.  I used to say, "God, when I get to one thousand, I will feel that my career was a success.  I'm gonna cut off the check-writing machine.  I'm gonna sign 'em and fill 'em out by hand.  Please let me employ one thousand African American broadcasters."  I now employ 1,800.  I have close to 2,400 total employees, 1,800 of whom are African American.  And now, my prayer is 2,500 black broadcasters, Lord, 2,500.  The more facilities that we acquire, the more opportunities we're able to provide for African Americans.  We now have a company called Research One [ph.].  And years ago, D. Parke Gibson used to do research on the black community.  And it was like the Bible.  It's so interesting, because even though advertisers now have definitely gone full steam into advertising to the black consumer, the majority of the big advertisers, because they understand the value, there's still not the type of in-depth, detailed research being done on the African American community and the experience that we deserve.  There's still not that understanding of why we have a preference for cable, and yet for twenty-five years, the cable industry denied us the opportunity.
Story_ID: 318676
Speaker 1: I started to tell you the Bob Johnson [Robert L. Johnson] story about--I felt that Bob for twenty-five years got this bum rap.  Why aren't there other black shows?  Why isn't he doing news?  Why he--he said he wanted to do entertainment.  The easiest group to entertain, twelve to twenty-four year olds.  The cheapest way, let somebody else send you the programs (laughter).  And that's precisely what he did.  Hello, when he cashed out, he became the first black billionaire, because of how shrewd he is as a businessman.  But it wasn't Bob Johnson keeping us out.  It was the cable industry.  Well, when Alfred [Hughes' son, HistoryMaker Alfred Liggins, III] was about fifteen or sixteen years old, he was watching BET [Black Entertainment Television] one day and hollered, "Ma, come here, come here, come here."  And BET was having a technical problem.  He said, "Let's sell our radio stations and go into the cable business.  We can do this."  I was like, "Alfred, we're in radio."  "No, ma, come on, let's do cable."  I'm like, yeah, okay, teenage dream; don't think anything more about it.  When he turned thirty-five, he start working on it again.  He wanted to be in the cable industry.  It took Alfred four years.  TV One [Silver Spring, Maryland] is totally his baby.  He did everything.  He asked me to do one thing during the whole four-year time, and that was to get him an interview with [HistoryMaker] Susan Taylor 'cause he wanted to use her in the video that we were putting together to pitch Comcast [Comcast Corporation].  That was it.  Everything else, Alfred did.  And Comcast decided, in exchange for a 49 percent equity participation in our company, percentage participation, that they would allow the second black channel to be on cable.  African Americans are so hungry for a destination for mature, quality programming that we went from zero to twenty million households in the first eleven months of our existence.  It took BET ten years to get to twenty million households.  First quarter, we made our budget for the year.  So we doubled the budget.  Second quarter, we made the second budget.  Advertisers have no way--they've been spending money with BET hoping that as your teenager is watching the last, the latest video, you might be in the room and see their commercial, because they had no vehicle to reach an African American adult.  And the response, the enthusiasm, the acceptance and the insistence that every cable distributor carry us.  We're now on DirecTV.  Rupert Murdoch was very wise.  He put us immediately in thirteen million of his DirecTV households because African Americans want to see something that positively reflects them and their lifestyle.  And that has been denied them.  Surf your cable channels.  How many channels you come across they speaking Spanish?  You don't have any idea what the heck they're talking about.  But if you were looking for something black, BET, BET, BET.  Or, if you hit VH1 at the right time, they might have had a black video on or the E [E! Entertainment Television] channel might have done a black story about some crime or some hip-hoppers or something.  Other than that, nothing.  And so now, after just one year of operation, we are at 20 million households and going great guns straight ahead.
Story_ID: 318677
Speaker 1: I wanna go back to the day you went public.  Can you talk about that for (simultaneous) --
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: --Radio One [Lanham, Maryland], and how, how you came up with the name Radio--I mean why you changed--'cause before the radio stations were called--(simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) My company was not called Radio One.  It was called Al-Mike Broadcasting [ph.], Al for Alfred [HistoryMaker Alfred Liggins, III], my son, Mike for Michael [Michael Hughes], Dewey's [Dewey Hughes] son.  When Alfred became president, his first official action was to change the name of the company to Radio One.  I didn't know.  He didn't tell me because he knew I wouldn't agree.  So The Washington Post calls me and says, "Why did you sell your company to Radio One?"  I'm like, "I didn't sell my company."  Well, there're papers filed at the FCC [Federal Communications Commission] transferring all the stock of Al-Mike Broadcasting to Radio One.  So I go into Alfred's office, and so he said, "Yeah, Ma, I changed the name."  I said, "You changed the name?"  He said, "Ma, I know it has sentimental value but nobody knew how to pronounce it.  They were calling it Al-Mick and Al-Mine.  They didn't know what they--."  And he said, "It didn't mean anything except to me, you and Michael."  And I was like, "Well, I understand you, but Michael.  There's been a divorce.  Michael's direct connection with this company is his name is in the name of the company."  He said, "Get him on the phone."  So we called Michael, and Michael said, "No, the new name, Radio One is a lot more commercially viable."  Well, now, we're Radio One, we're TV One [Silver Spring, Maryland], we're Music One, we're Research One [ph.].  And you look around, every company I know, Bank One, Media One, all these companies, one is the company, the name.  So, again, Alfred's vision.  And for weeks, I was like, "I'm not talking to you.  I'm mad.  You changed the name of my company."  Well, that was a gene that existed in him from his daddy [Alfred Liggins, Jr.].  I did not name my son Alfred.  I named my son, Jeff Jerome [ph.].  And I'm at home, seventeen years old with a brand new baby, saying, "How you doing, little Jeffie?  Mommy loves you."  And his daddy says, "Oh, that's not his name.  His name is Alfred."  I said, "His name is Alfred?"  "Yeah, we named him after his grandfather [Alfred Liggins, Sr.] and his daddy.  His name is Alfred."  He had gone into the nurse's office and changed the papers without notifying me that my son's name was now in honor of himself and his and my father, Alfred's [maternal] grandfather [William A. Woods].  So, when Alfred changed the name of the company without notifying me, I just said, "Well, that's his daddy's genes--and there's, okay.  It's happened to me before.  It's happened to me a second time."  So, Radio One, far more commercially viable name, something people know, easier to brand, the whole nine yards.
Story_ID: 318678
Speaker 1: Alfred [Hughes' son, HistoryMaker Alfred Liggins, III] then decides that he's going to go to Wharton [Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] and get his M.B.A., except he has one problem.  He's dropped out of college and doesn't have an undergrad degree.  So, we discovered that this accountant that I told you about that helped me years and years ago, graduated from Wharton, is on the admissions committee.  And he convinces them to take Alfred on a probationary status into their executive M.B.A. program.  But they made Alfred also take additional prerequisite credits in courses that he would have taken had he gotten his degree.  This put an incredible strain on him.  He's carrying like twenty-six credit hours.  During this time, we're trying to buy other stations, and not doing it, to this day, he says that we would have owned WDAS [WDAS Radio] in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], if he hadn't had term papers that were due, because every day he's having to commute up to Philadelphia after working a full day to take his classes.  [HistoryMaker] Larry Bailey corrected--convinced Wharton, correctly, that Alfred deserved the opportunity to be in their M.B.A. program.  He said to them, "He's already doing the--all he needs is--what you all are teaching people to do.  All he needs is the credentials.  Allow him to come show you.  He knows how to run a major corporation.  He just needs credentials."  After Alfred's first year, they dropped the probationary status, dropped the requirement that he take the courses that they were requiring him to take and allowed him to sail right on through.  He graduated like 126 out of like 3,000.  And he is the consummate business person.  But we're walking University of Pennsylvania's campus, right after graduation from Wharton, and I'm thinking, my proudest day of my life, my son, 'cause when he walked across the stage at grade school, in kindergarten, going into first grade, I knew I had a problem.  I said, Lord, please don't let this be the last graduation service I ever get to participate in, 'cause he had already start having my genes, that rebelled against established education surfaced, all right.  So he--we're talking across the campus.  He's twirling his cap and the gown is all open.  It's flopping open.  He looks over at me, "Yo, ma, you know we going public."  I said, "What?"  "We're taking the company [Radio One, Lanham, Maryland] public."  I just stopped dead in my tracks.  I said, "We're doing what, Alfred?"  He said, "We're gonna become a public corporation."  I was like, "Oh, no, I'm not having a whole bunch of strangers running through my life and my business and telling me--," 'cause remember, I had struggled all these early years when I wasn't turning a profit with my lenders complaining about financial statements, complaining about programming, complaining about, "Are you sleeping in the station [WOL Radio, Washington, D.C.]," the whole nine yards.  I'm like, "No."  He's like, "Don't worry.  I'm going to help you understand it, and once you understand it, you will come to the same conclusion that I came to."  He said, "The one thing that I am happy about you insisting that I get this M.B.A. is it opened my eyes.  We have to become a publicly-held corporation because the cost of money will prohibit us from growing if we don't."
Story_ID: 318679
Speaker 1: Alfred [Hughes' son, HistoryMaker Alfred Liggins, III] then became like a tutor, a mentor, a teacher.  He walked me through the entire process, and even when I still had reservations, he did a high-yield bond offering to run a test balloon up, a test run on our management team, because one of my last reservations was, we run real slim and trim, even now.  Wall Street likes that, but my managers wear a lot of hats.  And I was like, will they be able to withstand the rigors of the reporting required of a public corp--publicly-held corporation which are far greater now with Sarbanes-Oxley [Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002].  But even back then, the rigors were quite strenuous.  So he did the high-yield bond offering to test himself and our staff, and they came through with flying colors.  May 19th, Martin--Malcolm X's birthday, 1995, we're in New York [New York].  We're going public.  And I'm in the bathroom regurgitating as if I were pregnant.  That's how nervous I was, because right before our ticker came across the board, one of the Wall Street analysts said to me, "Do you realize that you will be the first corporation in the history of Wall Street headed by an African American female?  This has never been done before."  And that reaction of me getting sick to my stomach was almost like being pregnant and giving birth.  I realized that this was bigger than me and Alfred having growth capital.  This was bigger--this was me really lifting the bar for black womanhood, (laughter) you know.  I almost wanted to sing, "I am woman," (laughter) you know.  I needed an anthem.  And it made such an incredible difference.  So many of our staff members became millionaires because of the friend--friends and family list.  So many of our friends and acquaintances were able to achieve incredible financial success.  We opened at twenty-four and went to ninety-two in our first twelve months.  We then split, and it was such a glorious time, that first year.  Since then, the sector has been so depressed.  All radio properties have been undervalued.  And particularly when you're last in and you're African American, but we think that that will turn around.  We have never missed a projection.  Everything we have told Wall Street since day one has been the reality of the operation of my company [Radio One, Lanham, Maryland].  And that's why we're considered the best.  We are now the seventh largest broadcasting corporation in America, and we plan to be the sixth, the fifth, the fourth, the third, the second and who knows?  We might bump Clear Channel [Clear Channel Communications, Inc.] out of the number one spot before God finishes blessing us.
Story_ID: 318680
Speaker 1: Will you comment about you and your son's [HistoryMaker Alfred Liggins, III], you know, relationship and business relationship and why it has been so successful?
Speaker 2: I think because we, many years ago, made a pact that money would never be more important than our relationship and our family.  And it's not about money.  Certainly, we understand our number one obligation is to enhance, improve and upgrade shareholder value and participation.  But it also is about opportunity for African American broadcasters.  It's about a mission.  It's about a service, and now that he has grown into middle age, he embraces that more and more as well as our fiduciary responsibility to the bottom line.  We believe that you take care of your front line, your bottom line will automatically follow.  Our people, our employees, our listeners, our clients, are far more important to us than the dollar sign in front of our bottom line--
Story_ID: 318681
Speaker 1: I wanna ask the, you know, the story of you going for your first loan?
Speaker 2: Yes, oh, Sylvester [ph.], yes, please.  Syndicated Communications [Syndicated Communications, Inc.] had to put together a syndicate of subordinated debt holders.  But they had to find a senior lender.  Unfortunately, there was no black bank that had the lending capability and all the white banks we were asking were saying, no.  And we went through thirty-two different banks, including the Women's National Bank [The Adams National Bank] of Washington, D.C., that was supposed to be there for the benefit of quote minorities and particularly women entrepreneurs.  One of the problems though in, in defense of the banking industry, back then broadcast loans were not commonplace.  Most lending institutions did not even have a broadcast lending division.  They didn't understand that you may be paying $10 million for this property, but in hard assets, you had $500,000 worth of equipment.  Everything else was under the category of goodwill.  Well, lenders, this was foreign to them.  You can walk into a bank and borrow ten million dollars on goodwill, they didn't understand this because historically, broadcast facilities were owned--they were family operated.  The Johnson family, Lyndon B. Johnson [President Lyndon Baines Johnson], their wealth came from broadcast properties.  Lady Bird [Lady Bird Johnson] used to love to tell a story about the FM station that she picked up for $40,000 and sold for 40 million [dollars].  Families passed them down generationally, so a lot of these people that were saying, no, they had no clue.  After broadcasting started to explode, then it got easier to get loans for individuals.  It's still hard for minorities now and people of color and women.  But the thirty-third presentation was to a woman banker in New York [New York] at Chemical Bank.  And she--it was her first week on the job, a Puerto Rican woman named Lydia Colon.  And it was her first week on the job, and she said, yes.  And we just kept making the presentation.  The one thing, the good thing about making the presentation, by the time I made that thirty-third presentation, it was flawless because each time, I didn't take, no, personally.  I took it as an opportunity to improve my presentation.  Plus, remember, my father [William A. Woods] had been an accountant.  I understood the law of averages.  I knew that if I kept making the presentation, the law of averages would require someone to say, yes.  It was impossible, mathematically, for it to be all nos.  That's what the law of averages is about.  I train my sales team.  I tell them this old corny joke about this old drunk standing on a corner, talking to another drunk.  And he says, "Every woman that goes past here, I ask her if she'll go to bed with me."  And the other drunk said, "Yeah, I'll bet you get slapped in your face a lot, don't you?"  He said, "Yeah, but I also get a lot of sex," because the law of averages means you ask every woman that passes by you, somebody's gonna say, yes.  So my sales team is like, "What?"  I'm like, just keep asking, just keep pitching and someone's gonna say, yes.  So I got my first senior loan from Chemical Bank of New York.
Story_ID: 318682
Speaker 1: Three months after getting my loan [from Chemical Bank, New York, New York], prime goes into the mid-twenties.  I'm paying two and a half percent over prime.  One quarter my interest rate was 27.5 percent.  So three months into being business for myself for the first time, all of this economic reality, beyond my control, starts to send my company [Radio One, Lanham, Maryland] into a tailspin, and there's nothing I can do about the economy of the entire United States was just directly impacting my company.  The only thing that I can possibly do is work with my lenders and convince them to add that which I'm unable to pay in a timely fashion on the back end of my loan.  But I had learned a trick from my father [William A. Woods] that we used to teach to the small businesses that we represented.  And that was that every single, solitary month, you take all the total amount of money that you have to pay out and you split it among everybody that is owed.  So even though I may owe you a thousand dollars, and I can only send you a hundred, every month, you're going to get something and that the mistake so many small businesses make, is they stop paying the light bill or they stop paying this bill or they stop paying that bill.  So often some of my big creditors, they would send the check back saying it wasn't worth their time to process it.  But what it did was establish confidence that I was trying to be honorable about my loan, and I tell entrepreneurs, that's the most important thing you can do is establish credibility with the people that you owe money to.  The minute we start owing people money, we don't wanna take their phone calls.  We start hiding.  I'm like, don't let them call you.  You call them, say, "Excuse me.  I'm sorry but I don't have your full payment this month.  But I'm going to send you what I can."  So every month I took the financial resources that I had in the company, and I sent everybody, every month, everybody I owed money to received something.  And just like my daddy had taught me, they never, ever foreclosed.  They never lost confidence, and they start to believe in my dream, and they start cheering me on.  She's really gonna do this.  She's gonna pull it off, and then I would switch it around.  Maybe I sent you only a hundred last month.  So next month you gone get the five hundred, and the person who got the five hundred the previous month is only gonna get the hundred.  So it's looking better and better and better.  But every month, every single, solitary person I owe something to is gonna get a payment on it.  We went public.  The greatest joy was everybody got paid, and everybody made money.
Story_ID: 318683
Speaker 1: What do you want your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: That the world was a little better because I lived, that my community progressed even if it was just a little, itsy-bitsy, teeny weenie amount that there was movement forward, that there was improvement because of my life, because of my existence.  To me, success is judged on your very last day.  At your death is when your success is judged, and it's not judged by your money or your status or your prestige or what people think of you.  It's judged by the number of people's lives that you have directly had a positive impact on.  And I hope that on the day that I close my eyes, that there will be thousands of individuals who have improved, enhanced lifestyles because Helen Woods [HistoryMaker Helen Jones Woods] and William Woods [William A. Woods] gave birth to a baby girl named Cathy [HistoryMaker Cathy Hughes].
Story_ID: 318684
Speaker 1: But the black community, your feeling about the black community and its struggles?
Speaker 2: It's me.  I am the black community. I am so proud of my African heritage and legacy, I wouldn't trade it for anything.  I really do think, contrary to what the Bible and others--very important documents say, Africans are God's chosen people.  Why would the continent of Africa still be the only continent still with its resources?  Why did humankind start in Africa?  And as quiet as it's kept, guess what?  We are all African.  Every last person on the planet started off with the original Eve, and they have proven this.  The researchers, the scientists have proven it.  Life started on the continent of Africa.  So, am I proud that I'm part of God's chosen peoplehood?  Yes.  But that applies to everyone on the planet.  And I think that when you start embracing and accepting pride in who you really are, then that's when you're really able to have positive impact and influence on other people's lives.  I love the fact that I am an African [African American]--
