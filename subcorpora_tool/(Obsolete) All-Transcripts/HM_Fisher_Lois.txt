Speaker 2: My mother's full name was Georgia Milton Greene Ross [Georgia Milton Greene].
Speaker 1: Okay, and what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Oh, goodness.  Mother's birthday was November the 23rd I think.  I'm not sure.  And she was born in 19--1905.  I'm not sure.
Speaker 1: Okay, you say--you think about 1905?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, and she was born in the Grand Isles [sic. Grand Isle, Louisiana], I think, in Louisiana.
Speaker 1: Grand Isles, okay, Louisiana.  All right, now, what do you know about your mother's side of the family?  How far back can you trace that side and what details do you know about them.
Speaker 2: My mother--mother I think they came from Portugal, I'm not sure.
Speaker 1: So that's the story in the family?
Speaker 2: My brother [Allen Greene] knows more about it than I do, but, let me see, let me think.  Mother, mother's uncle and mother's mother [Eve Milton], they were, I think they were reared in the Grand Isles.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm. And, from what I can gather, the ancestors came from Portugal.
Story_ID: 481778
Speaker 1: Now, my brother [Allen Greene] knows all this.  My uncle--my mother's [Georgia Milton Greene] uncle, which was my great uncle, was a professor of music and he taught many musicians.  Have you ever heard of Plas Johnson?
Speaker 2: I have not but how do you spell his name?
Speaker 1: Plas, P-L-A-S, Johnson.  His father came out from under Uncle Adam, his name was Adam Lambert.
Speaker 2: Okay, so was Plas Johnson your great uncle?
Speaker 1: No, Plas Johnson was a cousin that came out from under my Uncle Adam.
Speaker 2: Okay, and your Uncle Adam's name was Adam?
Speaker 1: Adam Lambert, L-A-M-B-E-R-T.  They call it (pronunciation) Lambert.
Speaker 2: Okay, and he was a teacher of
Speaker 1: Music, he taught music and he also made violins.
Speaker 2: Hmph, that's something.  Taught music and made violins, okay.  Okay, all right.  Let's pause a second.
Speaker 1: Now we're rolling again.  You were talking about your Uncle Adam Lambert who taught music and made violins.  So he actually--did you ever have the privilege of watching him make a violin or part of the process?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, he made them in his garage. And they were beautiful--he gave me one and I left it with my mother.  And I don't know what happened but--and he played jazz violin.
Speaker 1: Okay, did he--did it take him a long time to make one?
Speaker 2: A violin?
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: No.  He could make them real fast.
Speaker 1: About how long do you think it would take him to make one?
Speaker 2: It's according to how he, you know, wanted to work on them.  He would--I think it would take him maybe about three or four months to make one, something like that.  But he made it by hand.
Speaker 1: Did he ever talk about how he learned how to do that?
Speaker 2: No, he never did--well, for one reason, when I would go around to his house he would either teach, you know, be teaching music or he had about ten kids and he was teaching all of them music.  So they all learned to play piano.  And he had one son named Adam, Jr. [Adam Lambert, Jr.] played guitar, lived in Chicago [Illinois] for quite a while.  His name was Adam Lambert.  Then he had a son that played piano, Famous Lambert.  And he had another girl, Enester [ph.], she played piano.  In fact, all of them played piano, bass, or--he had a son named Lloyd [Lloyd Lambert] that was noted with some of the top names.  And he played bass and trumpet.
Speaker 1: Okay, now this past weekend they had a piece about a woman out in Iowa, a white woman, that made--was making violins, you know, and it took her about the same amount of time as you say your uncle did.  It was like a--very few people can just do that anymore, just make a violin (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Make a violin, yeah.
Speaker 1: --on their own.
Speaker 2: And then get the right sound from them, you know, and I guess it was certain types of wood that they had to use to do that.
Speaker 1: Okay, so it sounds like--so you have like a musical family on your mother's side--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: --certainly.
Speaker 2: On my mom's side.
Story_ID: 481779
Speaker 1: Now you say, they--there's--the story is they were from Portugal?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And is it--we know that--well New Orleans [Louisiana] is a port--lot of people from different countries end up there.  Is there a story about how they got to New Orleans?
Speaker 2: My brother [Allen Greene] said that he traced it back to them coming over with Pirate Lafitte when he was down into Grand Isles [sic. Grand Isle, Louisiana] at the time, so I don't know whether my uncle came in with Pirate Lafitte or what.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Jean Lafitte, the pirate who fought against Andy Jackson [Andrew Jackson] in the War of 1812, Battle of New Orleans--or fought with him rather.
Speaker 2: Yeah, well they was supposed to have come in with him.  All I know is that Uncle Adam [Adam Lambert] and my grandmother which was named Eve [Eve Milton], they were in the Grand Isles and they came up to Thibodaux [Louisiana].
Speaker 1: So the Grand Isles are right off the coast of
Speaker 2: Of the Gulf of Mexico.  I think it's the Gulf of Mexico, isn't it?
Speaker 1: Yes, ma'am.
Speaker 2: So I knew it was down in there somewhere.  And then they came into Thibodaux.
Story_ID: 481780
Speaker 1: So your mother [Georgia Milton Greene] like--her family moved to Thibodaux [Louisiana] when she was a little girl?
Speaker 2: Yeah, she was a little girl.  And then her mother married my great-grandfather [sic. grandfather] who was George Milton, and, let me see, my grandmother, grandmother Eve [Eve Milton] died when my mom was nine years old.  So then my great-great-grandmother Elmira [Fisher's great-grandmother, Elmira Milton] reared my mother.
Speaker 1: Okay, so this is her great-great--her grandmother and your great-grandmother, Elmia [sic.]?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay, so she reared your mother.  Now, did your mother have any stories about growing up in Thibodaux? What it was like and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh yeah, she had a lot of different stories.  She grew up with my aunt, Owinda, Owinda Warren [Owinda Warren Tapplette].  And they had a lot of different stories they would tell.
Speaker 1: Can you remember any of them?  I mean, is there a good story from growing up that you can tell us?
Speaker 2: No, I can't remember.  I can't remember, I'll remember it after you leave (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay. So, she was--your mother was considered a Creole in growing up I guess?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, my mother was Creole.
Speaker 1: Now, could she speak French?
Speaker 2: Yes, she could and she spoke Latin fluently.  I don't know why but she loved Latin.  And she grew up to be a teacher and so she taught school.
Speaker 1: Now, where did she go to school?
Speaker 2: Mother went to--she was reared in New Orleans [Louisiana] and she went to McDonald 35 [sic. McDonogh No. 35 Senior High School, New Orleans, Louisiana] I think.  She went to--let me think, let me see.  I have such a poor memory when it comes to schools.
Speaker 1: But she went to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) But she went to, huh?
Speaker 1: I guess she went to a teachers college or something like that?
Speaker 2: Yeah, she went to teachers normal.
Speaker 1: Normal school.
Speaker 2: They call it normal, yeah.
Speaker 1: She didn't go to Xavier [Xavier University of Louisiana, New Orleans, Louisiana], did she?
Speaker 2: Yeah, she did.  She went to Xavier, uh-huh.  And she went to teachers normal and then she started teaching up in Plaquemine [Louisiana].
Speaker 1: Okay. Plaquemine. I'm not gonna ask you to spell that but it's (laughter)--
Speaker 2: P-L-A-Q-U-E-M-I-N-E.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, yeah, I've heard of that.
Speaker 2: It's right out of Baton Rouge [Louisiana].
Speaker 1: Right, yeah.
Speaker 2: And that's where she taught.  She was reared in what you call--they call it an old-folk home, because I had an aunt that was a great aunt, that was a mortician and they had a nursing home.  And my mother grew up in the nursing home with my aunt.
Speaker 1: That must've been interesting to be a young person around all these elders.
Speaker 2: Probably was, (laughter) but that's where she grew up.
Speaker 1: So can you remember any real stories?  She must've had all kinds of stories, ghost stories, and stories about race relations and all kinds of--music.
Speaker 2: She--mama didn't tell too many stories.  She very seldom told any stories.  And I was around her, oh, say, six months and I was around my aunt for six months.  I lived with my aunt in New Orleans so I was going back and forth.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you did that every year?
Speaker 2: Um-hm (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You'd be like six months with your mother.
Speaker 2: Six months with my aunt, six months with my mother.
Story_ID: 481781
Speaker 1: Let me ask you about your father's side of the family now.  So, can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: My father's full name was Allen Greene.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Allen Earl Greene.
Speaker 1: How did he spell Allen?
Speaker 2: A-L-L-E-N, Earl.
Speaker 1: E-A-R-L (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Greene. Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay, Greene.
Speaker 2: With an E.
Speaker 1: Right.  And what was his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: I don't know.
Speaker 1: Okay, was he older than your mother [Georgia Milton Greene]?
Speaker 2: He was a year or two older than my mother.
Speaker 1: Okay, say, about 1902 something like that (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Something like that. Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay, and where was he born?
Speaker 2: He was born in Plaquemine [Louisiana].
Speaker 1: Okay.  So it must be a story how they met in Plaquemine, I imagine, but I don't--but we'll get to that in a minute.  But what do you know about the ancestors on your father's side?  How far back can you trace them?
Speaker 2: I can trace back--my father's grandfather was an Irishman from Ireland and he was named--I know the last name was Rueben [ph.].  He married--from what I can gather, he married my great-grandmother who was a slave in Virginia.  And he moved from Virginia to Plaquemine with her.  And he had two sisters that lived in Seattle [Washington] but they were white.  My grandmother from what I could gather was the only child and--
Speaker 1: What was your grandmother's name?
Speaker 2: Josephine [Josephine Greene].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now was it, was it rough for your grandfather [sic. great-grandfather] and your grandmother [sic. great-grandmother] to live in Plaquemine, him being an Irishman and her being black?
Speaker 2: No, not at all.
Speaker 1: Okay, no stories about--
Speaker 2: Well, they--I don't have any stories about him.  I have stories about my grandmother, Josephine.  Okay, but I do remember when I was a little girl that they had a little grocery store in the front of the house where my grandmother lived, and his picture was in--she used to keep his picture in the grocery store.  And it was a picture with a--he had heavy mustache and she would say that is your grandfather--your great-grandfather.  So I do know that much.  My brother [Allen Greene] knows it all, that's why I told him (laughter) I said you should--what you should do is put it on tape so that we all can know who is who and what is what.
Speaker 1: That's always a good idea.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, because he did his thesis on the family tree.
Speaker 1: Okay, so he did a graduate thesis.  Okay.
Speaker 2: So he knows, you know, them all.  He checked into it and all.  And he tells me and I say, yes, okay, and it goes in one ear and come out the other.
Story_ID: 481782
Speaker 1: Did your father [Allen Greene] talk about growing up?  Now, he grew up in Plaquemine [Louisiana], right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, he grew up in Plaquemine.  And I wasn't around my father that much because he and my mother [Georgia Milton Greene] divo- well they separated.  They didn't get a divorce.  And when I was about two or three years old.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I was not around him that much.
Speaker 1: Did--is--was there a story that your mother or father told about how they met?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  My mother was teaching in Plaquemine and she was living--she had a room with my grandmother [Josephine Greene].  And my mother and my dad used to get in an argument because the bread man would bring French breads, those big long French breads, and mama and dad would fight with them.  And I guess they fell in love or something.
Speaker 1: They'd fight with the bread?
Speaker 2: Yeah, they'd fight with the (laughter). They'd always fight with the bread and my grandmother would say, "Why do you wanna fight with my bread and we have to eat it," you know.  But they would fight with the bread and they got together (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Guess it was kind of like flirting or something.
Speaker 2: Yeah. (Laughter) So they got together and I came along.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  They put the bread down, huh?
Speaker 2: Yeah, they put the bread down.
Speaker 1: They didn't stay together very long?
Speaker 2: No, they didn't stay together very long.
Speaker 1: So, you were basically raised by your aunt and your mother?
Speaker 2: By my [maternal] great-grandmother, Elmira [Elmira Milton], and Owinda [Owinda Warren Tapplette].  They reared me.
Speaker 1: Her name was Wanda?
Speaker 2: Owinda, O-W-I-N-D-A.  And her last name was Tapplette, T-A-P-P-L-E-T-T-E.
Speaker 1: Okay, now do you have a--now did your father have a chance to go to school too like your mother?
Speaker 2: My father was a contractor.  He built church steeples and things like that.  He built churches and all.  That was the type of work that he did.
Story_ID: 481783
Speaker 1: Well tell us, did--do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: Of my, my childhood?
Speaker 1: Yeah, what's your first childhood memory?  The first thing that you can remember.
Speaker 2: Being transferred back and forth because my great-grandmother [Elmira Milton] (laughter) wouldn't let my mother [Georgia Milton Greene] keep me.
Speaker 1: Now, well, okay now that raises a question as to why not?
Speaker 2: Because in the South in Louisiana there is a racial thing among the blacks.  And if you're a certain color they drift together, and my great-grandmother wanted me with her.  And she would tell my mother I'm gonna keep her.  I stayed with her until she died.
Speaker 1: Now, are you saying--now, was your mother considered white or black?
Speaker 2: My mother was black.
Speaker 1: Okay, and was your father [Allen Greene]--what was your father considered?
Speaker 2: My father was light.  I got pictures of them, would you like to see them?
Speaker 1: Well, we will at the end.  But, but was your father considered black too?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, well, why--I'm sorry I guess I just don't understand the color problem.
Speaker 2: There's a color problem whereas the lights always stuck with the lights, brown skin with the brown skin, and the real dark was--and my mother--my grandmother [sic. great-grandmother] wanted me with her so she kept me with her and my brother [Allen Greene] stayed with my mother.  And I stayed with my grandmother until she died, I was nine years old when she passed.
Speaker 1: Was your grandmother darker or lighter?
Speaker 2: My grandmother was extremely light.  She was mulatto.
Speaker 1: Okay, so she--so you stayed with your grandmother because you were lighter than your brother?
Speaker 2: Yeah, she made--she wanted me with her and that's why I stayed with her, but my mother kept my brother.  I started living with my mother when I was nine years old.
Speaker 1: Okay, was that--so some of us, I mean, it's hard for some of us, the rest of us and the rest of the country to understand the ways of New Orleans [Louisiana] so that's why I'm asking these questions.  You may think, well, everybody knows this but, you know, to the rest of us it's kind of odd that you would separate brothers and sisters based--sort them out based on their color.  But was that a common practice in Louisiana?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was to a certain extent.  But Grandma kept me with her all the time, she wouldn't let me go with my mom.  And then when my grandmother died then my mother took me.  But I was--my great-grandmother lived with my aunt, which was Owinda [Owinda Warren Tapplette], and she was a teacher in New Orleans.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right. Okay, now, so most of the time when you grew up, your household consisted of you and your grandmother and who else?
Speaker 2: My aunt.
Speaker 1: Your aunt, okay, so the three of you.
Speaker 2: Were together, and then when my grandmother died, then I moved with my mother and then I was with my mother, my brother and my stepfather.
Speaker 1: Okay, and when did your grandmother die?  How old were you (unclear), when you?
Speaker 2: I was nine years old when she died.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 481784
Speaker 1: Ma'am what were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Sights. Are you talking about things that I used to do when I was a little girl?
Speaker 1: No, things you used to see, sights, sounds and smells (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh well, I used to see Mardi Gras day and you always see the parades--watch the parades.  And whenever there was a funeral, you always watched that 'cause there was always a parade with the funeral.
Speaker 1: Now, what's a New Orleans [Louisiana] funeral like for those us who haven't seen one?
Speaker 2: Well, the funeral is when you are going to the graveyard.  Well, first you have the wakes, in which they have the wakes at night.  And they always have fish fries and they sold beer and that type of thing.  And everybody would go to the wakes.  And they'd sing and pray, they have a good time.  Then when you go to the funeral--for the funeral going to the graveyard, you go with the band playing and they play things like 'Nearer, My God, to Thee' or different hymns.  And after they bury you, the band comes and then they play 'I'm Glad You're Gone You Rascal You' [sic. 'I'll Be Glad When You're Dead, You Rascal You'].  (Laughter) And everybody's dancing when they come from the graveyard.  And there's the Mardi Gras day, we look forward to that.  And it's a lot of different things, I can't quite remember everything that we did but I do know that when I was growing up, my dad [Allen Greene] had a--what do we call a tavern, and I would go and visit him in the summertime.  And we would go and play in the dining room all the time.  I remembered him for that.
Story_ID: 481785
Speaker 1: I remember my dad [Allen Greene] used to go and paint--he would paint different places and take us with him, and have us to help him paint.  And I do remember he had to go and paint a mortuary, and he's afraid of dead people so he decided he would--he said I'll paint--he told the guy, he said, "I'll paint your place," he said, "but I'm not gonna paint it if there's a body in there."  And the guy told him there wouldn't be a body there.  So daddy went and started painting and they brought in a body.  And they put the body down and dad was saying, "I don't think I'm gonna finish painting today, I'll paint when you get rid of the body."  And so the guy said, "Well, finish that one little wall where you are."  And dad said, "Okay, I will."  And the guy walked out and left the body there and I guess he said the body will groan or something like that, getting rid of the last air.  And he groaned and daddy started running and he left his truck and ran all the way home.  (Laughter) And he never did go back and finish painting that mortuary. You know. Those are--that's something I remember.
Story_ID: 481786
Speaker 1: I remember my mother [Georgia Milton Greene] used to sing to me all the time when I was a little girl.
Speaker 2: What kind of songs would she sing? What songs would she sing?
Speaker 1: Usually a hymn or something like that.  Or she'd sit and play the piano for me when I was a little girl, I remember that.  I know she didn't let me play too much with the other children because she wanted me to--when I was with her she would, you know, keep me close to her.  And she would teach me how to crochet or how to knit because she, she said she didn't want anything to happen to me.
Story_ID: 481787
Speaker 1: I remember my [maternal] great-grandmother [Elmira Milton] when she would listen to Joe Louis' fight over the radio and we would sit and I'd watch her because she would, you know, be fighting like Joe Louis.  (Laughter) I remember that we used to listen to the radio.
Speaker 2: So, when--that was a big deal I take it the Joe Louis fights?
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.  It was really a big deal.
Speaker 2: Would other people come over to your house when--to hear it on the radio?
Speaker 1: No, but everybody would turn their radios up loud and you could hear all, you know, all around the neighborhood you could hear them.  And it was a thing whereas when Joe Louis fought, nobody did nothing but sit and listen, that's all they wanted to hear.  And I remember I used to sit and listen to 'Amos 'n' Andy' with her on the radio.
Speaker 2: Did you know that they were white when you listened to them on the radio?
Speaker 1: No, we thought they were black.  No, we didn't know they were white but we would listen to them.
Speaker 2: Were you surprised when you found out that they were white (laughter)?
Speaker 1: I didn't pay any attention, no.  (Laughter) But, yeah, I remember--oh, and I'd go walking with my great-grandmother in the evenings.  And every time when you walked down the street, you speak to everybody, you know.  And we would walk and grandma would stop and talk with peoples, people she never knew she'd just stop and start a conversation with them.  And I'd stand there and watch, so I was with her a lot.
Story_ID: 481788
Speaker 1: Did you know any of the people that would take part in the Mardi Gras in terms of the groups and such, 'cause I've heard there are different groups?  There are the Zulus [Zulu Social Aid and Pleasure Club], and then you got the Wild Tchoupitoulas and different groups would, you know, spend all year making their costumes.  And people are still doing that now in New Orleans [Louisiana] even after the flood.  So did you know any of those people?
Speaker 2: My [maternal] aunt [Owinda Warren Tapplette] named the--a group that was called the Night Steppers [ph.], and she was the one that game them the name.  It was a men's club and they would have little dances during the Mardi Gras season and all.  And they had debutantes and that's when you would have the girls--would have their coming out party.  And the Night Steppers used, used to do that.  So that's the only one that I remember because
Speaker 1: So these groups were sponsored, the debutante events too?
Speaker 2: Yeah, the blacks.  It was sponsored.  But I left New Orleans when I was what? Seventeen years old.
Speaker 1: About seventeen?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 481789
Speaker 1: When you think about your parents' personalities, your mother [Georgia Milton Greene] and your father [Allen Greene], who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: I think I take after my dad most because my mother was very, very quiet and very soft-spoken, but she was strict too, very strict.  And my dad was more carefree and outgoing, you know.  And so I think I took after my dad.
Story_ID: 481790
Speaker 1: Did you like to sing when you were, when you were a little girl?
Speaker 2: I started singing when I was six years old.  The first song I sang was in the church, 'Yes Jesus Loved Me' [sic. 'Jesus Loves Me'].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: That's a song a lot of little kids learn how to sing, I even learned how to sing that.  But, so what was the name of your church?
Speaker 2: Calvary, Calvary Methodist Church [Calvary United Methodist Church, Thibodaux, Louisiana].
Speaker 1: Okay, so your family was Methodist?
Speaker 2: My mother [Georgia Milton Greene] was--when she was born she was christened Catholic and then when her mother [Eve Milton] died and my great-grandmother [Elmira Milton] took over, my great-grandmother was Methodist.  So I grew up Methodist.
Speaker 1: Is that just the regular Methodist not the A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] or the C.M.E.?
Speaker 2: A.M.E., no, C.M.E.
Speaker 1: Colored Methodist Episcopal [Christian Methodist Episcopal]? C.M.E. (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Uh-huh, C.M.E.
Speaker 1: Okay. All right.
Story_ID: 481791
Speaker 1: Now what else did you like to do when you were growing up?  I mean, did you--I know you--sound like your mother [Georgia Milton Greene] was pretty strict but--
Speaker 2: She was very strict; she did not allow me to play a lot.  She always kept me in the house and she made me learn how to cook, how to crochet, how to sew and clean the house, things like that.  So, I didn't play with dolls and didn't have much of a childhood playing.
Speaker 1: You were around older people all the time with your aunts and your grandmother [Fisher's maternal great-grandmother, Elmira Milton] and your mother?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, and so I was constantly trying to learn how to do things in the house.
Speaker 1: Did you have a favorite thing that you could do that, you know, that was fun that they couldn't (laughter) stop you from doing?
Speaker 2: No, I didn't.  I didn't have a childhood like most children do, you know, because I became a young lady real fast and my mother said she didn't want me to play.  So, if--when I started living with my mother I would either clean the house--I did washing, I did washing on washing board and I did ironing with the smoothing iron not an electric iron.
Speaker 1: That's the kind of iron you had to put on the stove?
Speaker 2: Stove or you'd have like a little small crate or something and you put coals in it and put the irons on them and let them get hot.  That's what I learned how to iron with that.  And I learned how to wash on a washing board.  So my mother was a school teacher, and school teachers are lazy.  (Laughter) So my mother would see to me doing the washing on Monday, the white clothes, and then I'd have to hang them up and on, on Tuesday I would do the colored clothes.  And then on a Wednesday I would start ironing them, you know, ironing.  And my stepfather used to work on the railroad and he wore white shirts so I had to iron his shirts for him.

Speaker 2: That's right, Andrew Young grew up in the neighborhood where my brother [Allen Greene] and all of us lived.  My brother went to school with Andrew Young.  'Cause Andrew Young's dad [Andrew Young, Sr.] was a dentist.
Speaker 1: Right, right, so Andrew Young and his brother [HistoryMaker Dr. Walter Young] were both (unclear) to the two of them.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, they lived right across the street from us on Louisiana Avenue in New Orleans.  And then he went to Dillard [Dillard University, New Orleans, Louisiana] with my brother.
Speaker 1: Okay, what was Andrew Young like when you were growing up, and his brother?  His brother's a dentist now in Atlanta [Georgia].
Speaker 2: My brother was with him most of the time. I didn't have too much to.
Speaker 1: You didn't have any observations?  You didn't think, well, one day he's gonna be a great leader?
Speaker 2: Unh-uh.  Shoot, I--when my brother was in school he got my brother suspended for a couple of days because they were in the room playing cards and the dean walked up and knocked on the door, and Andrew told him grease your so-and-so and slide under the door.  (Laughter) And when the dean walked in and said, "Who said that?"  He pointed at my brother.  (Laughter) Andrew was something else.

Speaker 2: I went to Valena until I was about nine and then my grandmother moved to Thibodaux [Louisiana]--my [maternal] great-grandmother [Elmira Milton] and I went there and that's where she died.  Meanwhile, I was going to Washington [C.M. Washington High School] in Thibodaux because I had moved in with my mom [Georgia Milton Greene].
Speaker 1: Okay, Washington School, was it Booker T. Washington School? Or just a (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, it was named after one of our--one of my teachers, Mrs. Washington [Cordelia Matthews Washington], and they called it Washington.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you were there until I guess you were about nine when your grandmother [sic. great-grandmother] died?
Speaker 2: I was in New Orleans [Louisiana] until I was about nine and grandma came home, and that's when she died and I start living in Thibodaux with my mom.

Speaker 1: Did you like school?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I liked it, I guess so. Until I would go to my mother's room.
Speaker 1: Oh, she taught at the same school?
Speaker 2: Yeah, and then she would expect me to--well, she expected both of us to do better than any other children in the room, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay, now what was your brother's name?
Speaker 2: Allen [Allen Greene].  He was named after my dad [Allen Greene].
Speaker 1: Okay, so you had to--you were on the spot in your mother's classroom?
Speaker 2: Uh, uh, very much so.  And in my aunt's [Owinda Warren Tapplette] room too because, see, I told you every six months I was in New Orleans, six months I was Thibodaux.  When I was in New Orleans I went to McDonald No. 6 [sic. McDonogh No. 6, New Orleans, Louisiana].
Speaker 1: Now, McDonald you say?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, McDonald No. 6.
Speaker 1: Okay, now earlier you told us about a McDonald No. 35 [sic. McDonogh No. 35 Senior High School, New Orleans, Louisiana]?

Speaker 1: Okay, I just thought I'd ask.
Speaker 2: I don't remember but he was--whoever he was they named all the schools after him.

Speaker 2: (Pause) One of the teachers I liked was an English teacher, Mrs. Robertson [ph.], I used to like her.  And then there was the one, Mrs. Turner [ph.], I used to like her.  But my favorite was Mrs. Wallace [ph.] 'cause she taught me to sing.
Speaker 1: Okay, and which school was she at?
Speaker 2: She was at Washington [C.M. Washington High School, Thibodaux, Louisiana].
Speaker 1: Washington, okay, so Mrs. Wallace, all right.  So she took an interest in your singing voice and helped you develop it.
Speaker 2: So I started singing and I would follow--she was a Baptist; her husband was a Baptist minister.  But I would follow her to all the conventions, the Baptist conventions and I would sing at all the Baptist conventions with her.
Speaker 1: Okay, now these Baptist conventions--yeah, okay, so was this the National Baptist Convention [National Baptist Convention, USA, Inc.]?  Would she take you around the country?
Speaker 2: No, just around in Louisiana (simultaneous).

Speaker 1: So, you were singing basically hymns and--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, hymns and things like 'This Is My Task' [sic. 'My Task'], or the Lord's Prayer and things like that I would sing.
Speaker 1: Okay, now did you enjoy singing in those?

Speaker 1: All right, okay, now did you know--when you were growing up did you know any of the--there's so many famous musicians that come out of New Orleans [Louisiana] and--did you know the Marsalis family or any of the relatives?
Speaker 2: No, I didn't know the Marsalis family.  They lived way uptown around Kenner [Louisiana] I think it was, and I was further down.  No, I didn't know them but this Plas Johnson, he was with Henry Mancini, a sax man with Henry Mancini.
Speaker 1: Okay, now that's your cousin, right?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.  And he was also with--what is that girl's name?  She's a top singer, white girl, he played sax with her.  I'll think of it in a minute.

Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Story_ID: 481795
Speaker 1: Now did, did things get better in high school in terms of the strictness on you and everything or did it get 'bout the same?
Speaker 2: Nope, it was the same.  She never changed, and my [maternal] aunt [Owinda Warren Tapplette] was the same way too.  Both of them were very strict.  But she did let me sing with my [maternal] uncle at the country club when I was twelve.
Speaker 1: So this is--I know everything in those days was segregated down there so was this a black country club?
Speaker 2: Nope, this was a white (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) White? Okay.
Speaker 2: We had to sit in the back when we had intermission.

Speaker 1: Okay, so this is the one that made the violins?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh. He was the one that made violins.
Speaker 1: He was your great uncle, yeah?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: All right, so what kind of songs did you sing with him at the country club?
Speaker 2: 'Stardust.' What were the songs I'd do with him?  Let me see, it was a song called 'Trucking' [ph.], I remember doing that and--oh, my mind went a complete blank when you asked that question?
Speaker 1: Okay, but you were singing basically the popular songs in that era?
Speaker 2: Yeah, ballads and things like that.
Speaker 1: And this would be about 1940 or so?
Speaker 2: This was around the '40s [1940s], yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, early '40s [1940s], okay.  So they had to start I guess in the '30s [1930s] I guess.  I mean 19--no it was around the '40s [1940s] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It was around the '40s [1940s].
Speaker 1: You were born in '27 [1927] and yeah, it'd be around 1940, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, 'cause I was around fif- twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, 'cause I graduated from high school [C.M. Washington High School, Thibodaux, Louisiana] when I was sixteen years old.
Speaker 1: Okay. All right, so--

Speaker 1: Forty-four [1944], okay.
Story_ID: 481796
Speaker 1: Before we get to the debutante part I think it's time for at least one haint story or Hoodoo story or something?
Speaker 2: (Laughter)
Speaker 1: This is New Orleans [Louisiana] so janks, haints, (laughter) whatever.
Speaker 2: Well, we used to--my [maternal] aunt [Owinda Warren Tapplette] had a house right next door to our house and we would go over, Cousin Gracie [ph.] lived in my aunt's house and she would tell us ghost stories at night.  Well, it's real warm in New Orleans, you know, and so (background noise)--
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: (TAPE INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 1: All right, continue.  You were talking about your cousin's ghost stories.
Speaker 2: We used to go over to Cousin Gracie and sit with her at night on the front porch and she would be in the rocking chair and we sit on, and she told us that one night she and her cousin was coming home from church and her cousin could see spirits so she kept jumping and she kept saying, "What is wrong with you, why are you jumping?"  And she said, "Nothing."  So they started talking and playing and all of a sudden this girl started hollering and she say, "What's wrong with you?"  She said, "Spirit just slapped me."  And we would get scared (makes sound) and the she say, "Now I'm gonna tell you now."  She say, "You better be good 'cause if you not good spirit's gonna get you."  Yeah?  So, one night we had an uncle named Uncle Bill [ph.] and Uncle Bill knew she would sit out there and tell us all these ghost stories and scare us to death.  So he was real dark, and it was dark that night and put a sheet over his head, came around to the front porch (laughter) and we looked up and saw Uncle Bill and we started running.  Cousin Grace had fell off the porch with the rocking chair and everything.  She quit telling us ghost stories after that.  (Laughter) She say, "I ain't telling y'all no more ghost stories."  'Cause Uncle Bill was just (makes sound) and she (laughter) fell off the porch.  And it was a high porch, bang, down on the ground.  But my grandmother [Fisher's maternal great-grandmother, Elmira Milton] said that when she would come home from work at night, she used to work, well, on the street where we lived was called Narrow Street [ph.].  And a block down from where we lived there were four on each corner, it was like a street there.  And one corner was a tavern, across the street was another tavern and on this side was a tavern, and on this side was a mortuary.  And my grandmother was coming home one night and it was raining and she had a fifth of whiskey in her bag that they had given her at work, and she said when she got to this corner something kept pulling on her dress, kept pulling on her dress, and she say, she opened the bottle and poured a little whiskey on the ground and she walked a little further and something pulled on her and she poured some more whiskey down.  And say, by the time she got home she only had a half a bottle left.  So what we used to call it was the bucket of blood where these three taverns was and the mortuary.  And she said that, that was the ghost.  If you walked through there at night especially if it was raining, they would bother you.
Speaker 1: Seemed like a pretty dangerous formula, three taverns and a mortuary (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And a mortuary (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: That's where it was.
Story_ID: 481797
Speaker 1: Now tell us about, now, the story of how you did not become a debutante.
Speaker 2: Well, I was--I had gone to Southern University [Southern University and Agricultural and Mechanical College, Baton Rouge, Louisiana] and then I came out that summer and I got a job.
Speaker 1: Okay, well, let's go back a little bit.  Now you must've had pretty good grades in school then, to go to college?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, I had good grades.
Speaker 1: What were you majoring in, in Southern?
Speaker 2: I went into music, voice training.  I had voice training.
Speaker 1: And who were some of your teachers at Southern?
Speaker 2: I had one of the teachers, Mrs. Southern [ph.] and then I had--
Speaker 1: Did she get teased about her name, Mrs. Southern at Southern University?
Speaker 2: No. No, she should've been but no she was--and then I had--what was his name and I was crazy about him--Dr. Lee [ph.] I think his name was.  He knew every student by name when he walked across the campus, when he spoke to a student he called their name.  Dr. Lee his name was.
Speaker 1: And what, was he a teacher there?
Speaker 2: He was a teacher.  And, I don't remember my instructors' names, it was a lot of them but I loved going there.  I sang in the choir and the first year I was there they had 365 freshman girls in the dormitory that I lived in.
Story_ID: 481798
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And what were the rules? Now, I know the rules in those days were much different than they are today (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Very much so, yeah.
Speaker 1: And just--so just share with us some of the rules for living on campus in those days in the dormitories.
Speaker 2: When you lived on campus, we had chaperones to take us, like, for instance, if we went into Baton Rouge [Louisiana] the chaperones would take us in.  You were not allowed to have any boyfriends, not in the freshman dorm.  You could have boyfriends in the sophomore or junior dorms but you couldn't have them in your freshman dorm.  And you had to go to church every Sunday, vesper, they called it.  You had to go there, and you had to go to bed at nine o'clock at night lights were out.  You had to do your homework before you go to bed.  There were three floors in the dormitory that I was in.  And we had a house mother named Mrs. Odem [ph.], she was the sister to the president [Felton Grandison Clark] of Southern University [Southern University and Agricultural and Mechanical College, Baton Rouge, Louisiana] at the time.  And she was our house mother.
Speaker 1: So she had--so if you did something wrong, it would go right to the president presumably?
Speaker 2: Yeah, but she didn't allow any boyfriends, period.  If you were a freshman, you did not have boyfriends.  And if you did walk up to that dormitory with a boy, you would be, you would mess up the whole floor that you were on.  Like, for instance, if you lived on the third floor and you walked in with a boy, everybody on that third floor would get punished.
Speaker 1: Okay, so that's if you walked into the dorm with him?
Speaker 2: If you walk up to the dorm with him.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you weren't supposed to even be walking around with a boy on campus anywhere then, right?
Speaker 2: Unh-uh. Not in your freshman year.  So they were very strict.  We were--
Speaker 1: Did it work, I mean, did that kind--?
Speaker 2: (Makes sound) After a while, no, because what happened was one of the girls had--was going with a football player in the stadium dorm and our dormitory was right next to the stadium dorm, okay, so she would always--he would always come out and do a little whistle and this girl on the third floor would drop that sheet down and let the guy in.
Speaker 1: So he'd actually climb to the third floor?
Speaker 2: Climb to the third floor up on this sheet.  So, president emeritus found out about it so he goes one night and he whistles and the girl dropped the sheet and president emeritus went climbing up and when he got to the top, the girl looked down and saw who it was, she dropped the whole sheet, he fell.  Well, he got hurt behind that, he was hurt, really hurt bad.
Speaker 1: I imagine president emeritus was a fairly older man.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was an older man.  It wasn't too long after that he died.  And they buried him on the campus.  He's buried on Southern's campus.
Speaker 1: Did the girl get--?
Speaker 2: Nope, they didn't do a thing to her 'cause he didn't know who it was.  See, he couldn't pinpoint who it was.
Speaker 1: Oh, so they never found out who it was that was dropping the sheet out of the window?
Speaker 2: Unh-uh, and they dropped him down.  Well, that was in our dorm.  And they would--girls would take cans and we had marble staircase going up like this and this around and they would start throwing them and when all the lights were out, they'd throw these bottles and it would ring all the way down the steps and all.  Mrs. Odem would come up looking for it and nobody would say anything.  But it was a lot of fun and we had a nice time.  We used to give them a hard way to go (laughter).
Speaker 1: It sounds like it. Sounds very--
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, but we had a good time.
Story_ID: 481799
Speaker 1: Now did you like living at Southern [Southern University; Southern University and Agricultural and Mechanical College, Baton Rouge, Louisiana] better than being at home in terms of the--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I loved it there, I loved it there.  But I came out after my first year and I had to go to work.  And I went to work at Camp LaShay [sic. Camp Harahan; Camp Plauche, New Orleans, Louisiana].
Speaker 1: I'm sorry what was it?
Speaker 2: Camp LaShay.
Speaker 1: Okay, this is a [U.S.] military base?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I went to work there as a clerk.
Speaker 1: Now this is 1945?
Speaker 2: Nineteen forty-five [1945], '46 [1946].
Speaker 1: This is right at the end of the war [World War II, WWII].
Speaker 2: Yeah, so it was right at that time and so I work- was working in the camp and I met my husband, my first husband [Ralph Trotter].  And what happened was I started singing for the soldiers, and so I met him.  And he started booking me to work for all like the different social gatherings that the soldiers would have.  He would book me in to work with them.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, one thing led to another and I got married.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So this is 1946?
Speaker 2: Nineteen forty-six [1946] I got married February the 2nd.
Speaker 1: All right, so did this, did this cause any conflict with your mother [Georgia Milton Greene] and your [maternal] aunt [Owinda Warren Tapplette]?
Speaker 2: Yep, because my aunt got mad because she wanted me to become a debutante.  And my mother was mad because they were friends with a doctor out of Washington [D.C.] and she wanted me to marry him.  And I didn't.
Speaker 1: Okay, so did you continue--was Camp LaShay in Baton Rouge [Louisiana]?
Speaker 2: No, it was in Kenner [Louisiana] up, way up town, up by the Mississippi River.  I mean, yeah, Mississippi River bridge.
Speaker 1: In, in New Orleans [Louisiana]?
Speaker 2: In New Orleans.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 481800
Speaker 1: After you got married, did you continue to live in New Orleans [Louisiana] then?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: I got married and I was working at a club. What was the name of that club? I was working with--no, started working with a band called Paul Barbarin, big band.
Speaker 1: Okay, how do you spell that?
Speaker 2: B-A-R-B-A-R-I-N, I think.  It's in the--in that jazz book.  Anyway, I started working with him, Paul Barbarin and then my husband [Ralph Trotter] booked me--no, he got me a manager.  And this manager booked me into Washington, D.C.  So I left New Orleans in 1946, went to Washington, D.C.
Speaker 1: Okay, now you're like nineteen I guess.
Speaker 2: I was eighteen going on nineteen (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Eighteen. Okay, all right, okay.  So, where did you perform in Washington?
Speaker 2: I performed at the Stardust [Stardust Inn, Washington, D.C.] in Washington, and it was a club called Club Cavin [ph.].
Speaker 1: Now was that, was this kind of like a culture shock being in these clubs in--after having such a strict upbringing and having, you know, been at Southern University [Southern University and Agricultural and Mechanical College, Baton Rouge, Louisiana] with all that supervision?
Speaker 2: No, I guess I was--when I got to Washington, I was by myself and I would go to work and come straight back home.  And if I went out during the day, I would go by myself, didn't have anyone to go with.
Speaker 1: So, your husband didn't go with you?
Speaker 2: No, he was still in camp.
Speaker 1: Okay, he was in the [U.S.] Army?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was still in the Army.  So I left him in New Orleans.
Story_ID: 481801
Speaker 1: I stayed pretty much to myself when I was there [Washington, D.C.].  I had--I met a guy from out of New York [New York] called Bryson [ph.] and he got me an audition with Duke Ellington, and that night, it was Easter Sunday I was supposed to have the audition with Duke Ellington the Monday after Easter, 1946.  And some things came up that I heard and I didn't like so I wouldn't take the--I wouldn't go for the audition.
Speaker 2: Well, what happened, can you tell us?  Been a long time now, so I don't think it'll hurt anybody's feelings or anything, so.
Speaker 1: Well, I was living in this apartment--well, it wasn't an apartment.  I had a room which was--what was the name of it?  I can't think of it right now--but anyway I was living here, Showman's Inn [ph.], I was living there and I heard some things that was going down that I didn't particularly like if I had gone with Duke Ellington.
Speaker 2: Some things about how they operated and kind of things they did otherwise?
Speaker 1: Uh-huh, and I didn't approve of it so I wouldn't go.  In fact, that Monday I called my agent and asked was there anywhere you could send me, and I went from there to Richmond, Virginia and I worked in Richmond, Virginia.
Speaker 2: Okay now--
Speaker 1: (TAPE INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 2: Particularly like. And by being sheltered like my mother [Georgia Milton Greene] had been strict on me, I said, no, I don't want that.
Speaker 1: Well could we say that the Duke Ellington band was a little bit too wild for you in terms of what they did or did it have to do with them being too wild or not paying, or what was it?
Speaker 2: No it was, it was, it was--I wouldn't wanna say anything about.  Too wild, and I didn't want it.
Speaker 1: Yeah, 'cause you're not even--you're almost nineteen, you know.
Speaker 2: So, I didn't, you know, wanna go there.  But if you notice that Duke Ellington always carried two women vocalists.  And so I didn't wanna get involved in it so I left and went to Richmond, Virginia.
Speaker 1: Okay, we have to add all this up (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 481802

Speaker 1: --with my first child.  So I got off the road and settled in Indianapolis, Indiana.
Speaker 2: Okay, were you there doing shows already in Indianapolis?
Speaker 1: In Indianapolis, no, I hadn't done any shows at all in Indianapolis.  I left Tennessee and went to Indianapolis.
Speaker 2: Okay, so you left Nashville, were you in Nashville then?
Speaker 1: Yeah, uh-huh.
Speaker 2: And then moved to Indianapolis.  Okay, now was that the home of the father [Ralph Trotter] of your child?
Speaker 1: Yes, that's where he was living.  So I left Tennessee and went there, met him.  And I was pregnant so I quit working for a change.  So then I had my daughter and I had my fist son [Ralph Trotter] right there.

Speaker 2: It was during the '50s [1950s] I think, 1950.  It was around 1950, yeah, because--1950, '51 [1951], something like that.
Speaker 1: Okay, now why did you leave Count Fisher's band?
Speaker 2: Well, I had sent my children home to my mom [Georgia Milton Greene] and I decided I wanted to go home and be with my children.  I didn't wanna be away from them so I left and went back to New Orleans where they were. Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's when I started working at the Dew Drop Inn [New Orleans, Louisiana]
Story_ID: 481804
Speaker 1: You all got two dollars per night. If you--well you got two dollars?
Speaker 2: I did, I don't know what the others got.
Speaker 1: But someone like Ray Charles who was the head of the show you imagine he would get how much?
Speaker 2: I would imagine he would get around hundred and a quarter something like that.
Speaker 1: Okay. So if he did (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Because he was out of town and he, you know, came in.  So he was probably was getting a little more, I don't know for sure.
Speaker 1: I suspect that they paid women less money than men?
Speaker 2: Well, yeah, especially working the black clubs, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay, and in those days, now, we hear people talk about the Chitlin' Circuit of black clubs, the different black clubs around the country.
Speaker 2: I don't know too much about that but I worked the Dew Drop Inn [New Orleans, Louisiana] which was a notable place then, you know, everybody wanted to get into the Dew Drop Inn.  And I worked there for a while but then I got a job working for the syndicate which was the Marcellus [sic. Marcello].
Speaker 1: Okay, the syndicate, that the Marcellus family the famous Marcellus family?
Speaker 2: That's right.  I worked for Pete [Peter Marcello].
Speaker 1: And the syndicate was the name of their group?
Speaker 2: No, no, no.
Speaker 1: Or their club?
Speaker 2: No, the syndicate was the mob.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay, you're talking about, oh, okay, all right.
Speaker 2: And I started working at the Joy Lounge.  It was called the Joy Lounge over in Gretna [Louisiana].
Speaker 1: Okay, Joy Lounge.  So you're saying this club was actually controlled by the
Speaker 2: By the mob, the Marcellus because Carlos Marcellus [sic. Carlos Marcello] if, if you know anything about the mob, they would try to run him out of Louisiana and he would--he had a yacht and he would park it out in the middle of the lake and still run his business.
Speaker 1: These are the Italian mob, okay.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, these were Italian.
Speaker 1: How do you spell the last name?
Speaker 2: Marcellus?
Speaker 1: Well, take a try at it if--
Speaker 2: I'd say M-A-R-C-E-L-L-U-S [sic.] or something like that (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Story_ID: 481805
Speaker 1: Then I started making a hundred dollars a week--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --when we was working six nights a week.
Speaker 2: Is there a certain band that backed you up? I mean that played--a house band (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, I had a guy by the name of Teddy, Teddy Wilson [ph.] I think his name was.  He was a saxophone player.
Speaker 2: Okay, and this is the kind of show where--
Speaker 1: Well it was just a band playing and I sang with them.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right.  And only, well, correct me if I'm wrong but white people would come to the show, it wasn't a mixed crowd, right?
Speaker 1: No, no, no, it was only white.  It was an all-white club and we would, we would go on and play, but when we had intermission we'd have to go back in the utility room and sit.
Speaker 2: You're all dressed up and singing and, you know, they used to wear the beautiful gowns in those days, men with tuxedos and such.  And when you were finished you'd have to go back to the utility closet.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and sit in there until it was time to go back on again.
Speaker 2: Okay, now, where would the white performers go?
Speaker 1: We didn't have any white performers, it was only black that worked there. And--
Speaker 2: So people didn't come--did people come up and want autographs and that sort of thing?
Speaker 1: No.  They'd come up and ask you to do songs and plenty of times we was supposed to get off at two [o'clock] and if they demanded us to work longer he would ha- he would make us work longer.
Speaker 2: Did you get more money if you worked longer?
Speaker 1: No, you just worked.  We'd work until maybe three or four o'clock in the morning.
Story_ID: 481806
Speaker 1: Now did you have a sense in those days that this was the mob, did you actually know it was the mob at the time?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I knew about it but I didn't know too much about, you know, the mobs.  And as long as I didn't have anything to do with them at all.
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I think it would probably make a difference in your attitude in terms of complaining about time (laughter).
Speaker 2: At that time, Fats Domino, they were over Fats Domino too.  He worked for them and they were the ones that saw to him, you know, making records and everything.  He said they didn't have anything to do with it but he was under them too, Fats Domino and it's another guy--what's his name, I'll think of it.
Speaker 1: I think I know who you're talking about and I can't think of his name but--
Speaker 2: But he had a big band at the time.
Speaker 1: Lot of music coming out of New Orleans [Louisiana] in those days and I don't think the rest of the people in the country understood where the music was coming from.  But Fats Domino was a huge star in the mid-'50s [1950s] and 'Blueberry Hill' and whoever the fellow was.  I can't think of his name who did, (singing) "Duh da da duh, duh, duh da-da da-duh."  Remember that song, down in Mississippi, down in New Orleans.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, what was his name?
Speaker 1: Yeah. But a lot of these guys have been on the radio lately talking about New Orleans is so much in the public eye now because of the hurricane [Hurricane Katrina].  Lot of people talk about the culture and what was lost and where a lot of things came from that people didn't know about, that actually came out of New Orleans.  And, of course, it's the home of jazz and Louis Armstrong and Sidney Bechet and all of them, King Oliver and, you know.  But there are other musicians too that contributed greatly to what we were calling then rock and roll, which is now, you know, now rock and roll is something else altogether with long hair and everything.  But in those days it was Fats Domino.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was Fats and we remember when Fats first started.  He used to stand on the corner and sing.  But he had a brother, I'm trying to think of what his brother's name, because his brother borrowed two mics [microphone] from me and never did give them back to me.  Oh, I almost called his name.  Just this guy had a big band and most of the time when Fats would go out he would go out with him, you know, this big band.  And all them had something to do with the Marcellus [sic. Marcellos].
Speaker 1: Did you know [HistoryMaker] Harold Battiste by any chance?
Speaker 2: That name sounds familiar.
Speaker 1: He's a musician, he ended up--we interviewed him in New Orleans, he ended up doing the music for Sonny and Cher.  He was the band leader for the Sonny and Cher show [sic. 'The Sonny and Cher Comedy Hour'] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh he did?
Speaker 1: And he wrote all their songs actually, he's a black man from New Orleans.
Speaker 2: Harold Battiste, I think I know him.  A tall light-skin (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) No, short, dark, yeah.
Speaker 2: Heavy-set fellow, isn't he?
Speaker 1: No, 'bout medium size, kind of smallish.
Speaker 2: I might know him if I see him.  I forget all the names.
Speaker 1: He's at University of New Orleans [New Orleans, Louisiana] now teaching music.
Speaker 2: Oh, he is?
Speaker 1: Yeah, yes ma'am.  But he's--he was Sonny and Cher's--he came up with the songs that Sonny and Cher--and for Dr. John.  He wrote Dr. John's songs.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, now, Uncle Adam [Fisher's maternal great uncle, Adam Lambert] that I was telling you about, okay, the bass player for Dr. Jones [sic. Dr. John] was his son, my cousin, his name was Lloyd, Lloyd Lambert.  And he was the first one to use the electric bass.  He was the one that started playing the electric bass.
Speaker 1: Yeah, 'cause that's right.  There was a time when you didn't have electric bass on--
Speaker 2: We had the upright bass.
Speaker 1: --records. And lot of the singers would sing the bass part in these three part harmonies.  The bass would come from the guy's voice a lot of times.
Speaker 2: Well, he played the upright bass but then he also played the electric bass.  He was the first one, I think he started with that John, Dr. John or whatever his name was.
Story_ID: 481807
Speaker 1: Now how long did you play with this syndicate group?
Speaker 2: Okay, I was there for about four or five years and Pete [Peter Marcello] decided that he wanted me to become his mistress.  And he had a home built and everything and took me to it, took me and told me that he wanted me to become his mistress.  And I told him, no.  And I told my mama [Georgia Milton Greene] about it, well, he called and told my husband 'cause I was--he told Ralph [Ralph Trotter] that he would drop him.  So I quit, I quit working for him.  He started asking different musicians in New Orleans [Louisiana] to get me to work with them and if I--if they could get me to work with them, they would have a lifetime job.  And every time they would tell me who wanted me to go back to work I wouldn't go.  So then I got a job working down below the Industrial Canal in New Orleans in the Glass House [New Orleans, Louisiana], and I went in and I started singing.  He came about three days later and sat at the bar, looked at me and smiled, got up and left, and the man fired me for singing too loud.
Speaker 1: Now what is this man's name, Pete what?
Speaker 2: Pete Marcellus [sic.]
Speaker 1: Pete Marcellus, okay.
Speaker 2: And then I went into a job in Algiers [New Orleans, Louisiana] and the same thing happened.  Every time I got a job I would get fired for either singing too loud or I couldn't do the work.  So what I did was--what did I do, oh, I packed the kids up and I went to--no, no, no, no, I went and got me a job in Biloxi, Mississippi that's where I went.
Speaker 1: That's down on the gulf going east.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I worked at the Beachwater [Beachwater Restaurant and Club, Biloxi, Mississippi] and I would drive back and forth.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you were living in New Orleans but driving back--commuting to the Beachwater in Biloxi?
Speaker 2: And I worked there for about two years and--
Speaker 1: Now are we still in the '50s [1950s] now or are we (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, we're still in the '50s [1950s], and we tried to--after about two years the band tried to get me to go back into a club that was further down the Mississippi River from Gretna [Louisiana].  I'm trying to think what's the name of that little town--anyway, Pete had built another club called the Nightmare [ph.] and a musician got me in there and he didn't tell me Pete owned it but when I got there--now I worked for two nights and he came and saw and laughed and said, "I got you."  And I quit, I packed my car.  I had an old Buick, I packed my car, packed my children, put them in the car, and took off for Cincinnati, Ohio 'cause that's where my husband was.
Speaker 1: Okay, so this must've been nerve wracking, you know, for--
Speaker 2: It was, it was very nerve wracking.  And, see, Ralph had left and went to Cincinnati, Ohio because Pete had threatened him.  So, went to Cincinnati, Ohio and I started working in Ohio.
Story_ID: 481808
Speaker 1: So you worked in some clubs in Cincinnati [Ohio]?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, worked Clarence's Crazy Cottage [Cincinnati, Ohio], and I worked, oh, have to look in the book to find out what was the name of that other one.  But anyway, I worked there with a group called Frankie Payne Trio.
Speaker 1: That's P-A-N--?
Speaker 2: Pan, P-A-Y-N-E.
Speaker 1: Okay, Payne, okay.
Speaker 2: And I was there for about five years and I worked--one group I worked with called Popeye [ph.], and I worked over in Covington, Kentucky.  I worked over in two, three places in Covington and in Cincinnati.
Speaker 1: You ever work in Dayton?
Speaker 2: Dayton, Ohio?
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: No, no.  I worked from Cincinnati back into Kentucky.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then finally I left there and I went back to Indianapolis [Indiana].
Story_ID: 481809
Speaker 1: Now during all this time--now did you ever--did ever- anybody ever approach you about cutting a record or anything?
Speaker 2: I cut a record in Cincinnati, Ohio with Bill Doggett.
Speaker 1: Okay, the famous Bill Doggett, I know he was my parents' favorite organ player.
Speaker 2: Really?
Speaker 1: When I was a kid, they always danced to Bill Doggett.
Speaker 2: Well, I cut the thing called 'Love Is Strange' with Bill Doggett.
Speaker 1: Now is that the same 'Love Is Strange' that Mickey and Sylvia made?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I did the cover for it.  And that record company--I don't know what record company it was but they signed me up for a year and I didn't even push it.  I didn't even try, you know, to do anything.  But I was with Bill Doggett for that.
Speaker 1: But you don't remember the name of the record company?
Speaker 2: (Shakes head) I don't know whether it was the Blue Note [Blue Note Records] or what, but it was out of Cincinnati, Ohio.
Speaker 1: Should be easy to find out though because Bill Doggett was on that label.  It should be easy to find it.
Speaker 2: I been trying to find it because I--you know, would like to find that record if I could.  And what happened was, a guy came in the club that night and told me, says, "I want you to come and cut a record."  And I said, "Yeah, right."  And I didn't believe him, and he gave me a card and told me to come down to--it was the week before Christmas.  And so I told him, I said, "Yeah, okay."  And the next day I was up washing and he called me up and he said, "Are you gonna come down here and cut this record or what?"  And so I said, "Well, I don't have a car I can't get to you," 'cause my husband [Ralph Trotter] had taken the car.  So he said, "Well, I'm gonna send a cab for you."  I said, "Okay," so he sent the cab and I got in the car and I went there.  And there was Bill Doggett and his group, and they gave me the music, played it and I cut the record.
Speaker 1: Now did the Mickey and Sylvia record come out first?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  See, mine was the cover; it was a cover.
Speaker 1: So this is in the '60s [1960s], this is 1961?
Speaker 2: No, it wasn't '60s [1960s], still in the '50s [1950s].
Speaker 1: Okay, I thought that record came out in the '60s [1960s], early '60s [1960s], '60 [1960], '61 [1961].
Speaker 2: No, this was in the '50s [1950s] I think.  And the other one I'm trying to think what was on the other side.  Anyway--
Speaker 1: So they cut it as a--in those days, now, were they--
Speaker 2: It was a 45 [45 rpm record].
Speaker 1: It was a 45, okay. All right.
Story_ID: 481810
Speaker 1: So but you went to Indianapolis [Indiana] in--shortly thereafter (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Now I left Ohio and went back to Indianapolis.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that's when I started working with Count [HistoryMaker Lessly "Count" Fisher]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --at the Joy Lounge [sic.].  Was it the Joy Lounge?  Bar Music [ph.].
Speaker 1: This is with Count Fisher, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I started working with Count Fisher.
Speaker 1: Okay, so how did that work out?
Speaker 2: Well, at first I was working in a liquor store and Count came in and I used to sing in the little bar next to the liquor store, which was called the Hub Bub [Indianapolis, Indiana].  That's where Wes Montgomery and all them used to come in.
Speaker 1: He's from Indianapolis?
Speaker 2: Indianapolis, yeah.  So Wes would come in and I'd go in there and sing with them.  So one night, Wes asked me to come to this after-hour place and audition for a job so I said okay.  So I left my job and I went to this club, it was an after-hour place and Wes told me, he said, "You sit here and wait until we finish jamming on this number and I'm gonna call you up." I said, "Okay."  Well, before he could call me up the police came in and raided the place and he ran out and left me.
Speaker 1: So, did you get arrested?
Speaker 2: Yes, I did. (Laughter) And Count and Dizzy Gillespie was standing outside watching when I went to jail.
Speaker 1: And Dizzy Gillespie?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And I went to jail and I got out, and Count came and he said, "I'm gonna give you a job."  And that's when he gave me the job with him.
Speaker 1: Okay, so did you perform with Wes Montgomery's group that one time?
Speaker 2: No.  I quit speaking to him. I wouldn't talk to him anymore because he ran off and left me in this club.
Speaker 1: Okay, so he had recruited to perform with him at this club (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, at this place.  He wanted me to start working with him at the place--
Speaker 1: But it didn't work?
Speaker 2: --and it was an after-hour joint.  So he wasn't--hadn't become big either at the time.
Story_ID: 481811
Speaker 1: So Indianapolis [Indiana] must've been jumping in those days.
Speaker 2: It really did (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Dizzy Gillespie, Wes Montgomery?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, well you had the Hamptons that were there.
Speaker 1: Lionel Hampton and--?
Speaker 2: No, they were the Hampton family.  And--
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): Leroy Vinnegar.
Speaker 2: Leroy Vinnegar was there.  I don't know him though.  But Soro Van Riper [ph.].
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): Freddie Hubbard.
Speaker 2: Freddie Hubbard, too?
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.  Because all the big stars would come through.  That's how we met Redd Foxx, and George Kirby, Moms Mabley, we had all these top acts, and at that time Motown [Motown Records] was coming out so you had James Brown and all of them would come to Indianapolis.
Speaker 2: Was the Walker Theatre [Madame Walker Theatre Center] operating then in Indianapolis?
Speaker 1: No, the Walker--yeah, it was going but it wasn't like it is now.
Speaker 2: Okay, so it was kind of down 'cause it had been big at one point I think then by--but in the early '60s [1960s] it was down.
Speaker 1: But you had clubs all over Indianapolis then.  So I started working with Count [HistoryMaker Lessly "Count" Fisher] at the Bar Music [ph.], which was downtown a half a block from the state capitol.  And we left there--the guy that owned the place bought a place called the Carousel [Carousel Club, Indianapolis, Indiana] so we moved out on 32nd [Street] and Capitol [Avenue]?
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): (Unclear).
Speaker 1: And Meridian [Street].  So we worked the Carousel and that's when we was on the same circuit with June Christy, the guy that say I get no respect--what's his name?
Speaker 2: Rodney Dangerfield?
Speaker 1: Rodney Dangerfield, all of them were on that same circuit.
Speaker 2: June--?
Speaker 1: Christy.
Speaker 2: Christy, okay, and Rodney Dangerfield.
Speaker 1: Redd Foxx, George Kirby, all was on that same circuit.
Speaker 2: Okay, star-studded group.
Speaker 1: Yeah, but they were just beginning to rise, you know, so all of us was out there together.
Speaker 2: Do you have any stories about some of these personalities, George Kirby was an artist.  He could do a number of different things.
Speaker 1: Yeah, George Kirby told somebody I was his girlfriend, and I wasn't George Kirby's girlfriend.  He used to come in the club and listen to us, you know.  But he came in all the time and Redd Foxx would come in.  And he had a little motorcycle I guess he would ride and he called Rojo, something [Zorro Rojo].
Speaker 2: He had a name for his motorcycle?
Speaker 1: Yeah. And he wore--had a (unclear) he kept down in his pants.  They would come down to the club wherever we were working and talk to us or we would meet at night at the Knife and Fork [ph.].  It was a restaurant that everybody would meet, Moms Mabley, and everybody else.
Story_ID: 481812
Speaker 1: We were talking about some of the people you all worked with and we were talking about Redd Foxx and George Kirby, now, what was Rodney Dangerfield like?  Was he as rained upon in real life as he was on stage?
Speaker 2: I can show you a picture of him, he doesn't look anything like he looks now, used to look.  But he was at the Embers [Indianapolis, Indiana] which was in the--down in the next block from where we were.  And he would come down at night and sit in the Carousel [Carousel Club, Indianapolis, Indiana] and listen to us.  I didn't have anything to say to him.  I don't think Count [HistoryMaker Lessly "Count" Fisher] had anything to say to him but we would just see him, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay, what about Moms Mabley?
Speaker 2: Moms (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) She was really popular at what point, had all these albums.
Speaker 2: That's right, Moms Mabley would come. Moms Ma- I remember when we were at the Knife and Fork [ph.] and Moms Mabley came in one night, and she had on this black suit and had a cap on and all, and this beautiful girl walked in with her.  And all the guys in the Knife and Fork start trying to talk to her, and she let them come up and talk to her and then all of a sudden she said, "I think it's about time you guys leave my girl alone 'cause that's my girl."  And everybody said, "Well, all right."  But she, she was very quiet when--
Speaker 1: When she wasn't on stage?
Speaker 2: When she wasn't on stage, she was very quiet.
Speaker 1: And she didn't look the same--I guess she--did she always dress like she did on stage?
Speaker 2: No, no, she would dress in--she always wore a black suit or a brown suit.
Speaker 1: Like a man's suit?
Speaker 2: Like a man's suit, and she wore, you know, a cap or a hat.  And she had her teeth in and everything, she looked real nice, nothing like she did on stage.
Speaker 1: So you would think that most people probably wouldn't recognize her if they didn't--
Speaker 2: Some of them probably wouldn't, but she was not a bad-looking woman when, you know, she dressed up right.
Speaker 1: Was her voice still the (makes sound) like that, deep?
Speaker 2: Still the same voice, yeah, but she had like a deep voice and she didn't go into that Moms thing.

Speaker 1: With John Coltrane?
Speaker 2: Yes, Lord.
Speaker 1: Okay now, it's gotta be a story behind that yes, Lord.
Speaker 2: John Coltrane came to the club [Carousel Club, Indianapolis, Indiana] to work with us and he, at that time, he was drifting off into something else and he--his horn just screamed and his drummer was what--Alvin?
Speaker 1: Elvin Jones right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Elvin Jones and he crashed and hit those cymbals.  I think I went through a bottle of aspirins in one-week time.  They were going off into something else.
Speaker 1: So, did he have his famous quartet together then?  Elvin Jones, Jimmy Garrison on bass?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] McCoy Tyner on piano. That was a time I guess when they were moving I guess toward a more avant garde kind of jazz.
Speaker 2: I don't know what kind of jazz they were doing, everybody was doing their own thing.  You, you really didn't know what they were playing--
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): (Unclear).
Speaker 2: --you know, so.

Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Always.  We had what they would call battle of the bands, so Count [HistoryMaker Lessly "Count" Fisher]--we always took the battle of the bands so they stopped having them.
Speaker 1: How many pieces were in your band, the Count Fisher's band?
Speaker 2: Three.  We had Count, which was the drummer, and Erroll Grandy organ, and Chuck Bush, sax player.  But they could--you could stand outside and listen to the three of them and they sound like Count Basie's big band.  And we won everything that--anything they had and we'd enter it, we'd win it.  We worked all the muscular dystrophy things.
Speaker 1: Telethons?
Speaker 2: Telethons, and we worked that with Lorne Greene.

Speaker 1: I know we talked about Idlewild [Michigan] when we came in, when did you all first go to Idlewild (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Oh, well, let me see.
Speaker 1: Or am I getting too far ahead of the story?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's way ahead 'cause we--
Speaker 1: Okay, well keep going.  I don't wanna mess this chronology up.
Speaker 2: When we left Joe [ph.]--the Carousel [Carousel Club, Indianapolis, Indiana] and then we went in a club of our own called Chateau de Count and Eve [Chateau de Count et Eve, Indianapolis, Indiana].
Speaker 1: Chateau--? I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: Chateau de Count et Eve.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.  Now, that's, that's quite a move, you moved into your own club.
Speaker 2: Own club, yeah.

Speaker 2: Uh-huh.  And that's when we started booking in acts, different acts.
Speaker 1: Okay, so who all performed there for you?
Speaker 2: Well we had Redd Foxx, we had Jimmy McGriff, we had Jack McDuff, we had Coltrane [John Coltrane].  We was supposed to get the comedian, the one that said, "The devil made me do it."
Speaker 1: Oh, Flip Wilson.
Speaker 2: Flip Wilson, but we turned it down because we didn't know who he was.  And--
Speaker 1: Now, trying to think--Godfrey Cambridge was a big--was getting big in those days to.  Did you ever have him as a comedian?
Speaker 2: Unh-uh.  Though we had some dancers out of Philly [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] and then we had some dancers out of Canada.  We had quite a few--oh, we had Roy--I was looking at the contracts last night, Hamilton, Roy Hamilton.
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, right.  He had the--his big hit was--well, one of his big hits was 'You'll Never Walk Alone,' then he did--what's the one that everybody-'Ebb Tide,' yeah, 'Ebb Tide' and--
Speaker 2: And we had Lula Reed.
Speaker 1: Lula Reed and somebody mentioned Ike [Ike Turner] and Tina Turner, did you have them?
Speaker 2: No, we didn't have them.  I think Count [HistoryMaker Lessly "Count" Fisher] worked with them in Chicago [Illinois].  So then we had that for about three years and then Count's mother [Ruby Mosby Fisher] got ill and she wanted him to come here so we sold the club.
Speaker 1: Now, when did the club open?  Do you remember the year at all?
Speaker 2: Let me see, we came here in '66 [1966] so it was 'round '64 [1964], '65 [1965].
Speaker 1: Okay, so the club was in existence '63 [1963], '64 [1964], '65 [1965], you say?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay. All right.
Speaker 2: And so we sold it and left and came here to Grand Rapids [Michigan] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now--
Story_ID: 481817
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now, when you had the club [Chateau de Count et Eve, Indianapolis, Indiana], now, it was like--those were some of the--I guess, the real intense civil rights days when a lot of change going on in the country.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: Did you--'63 [1963], you know, the March on Washington and '64 [1964] the Freedom Summer in Mississippi, and '65 [1965] Selma [Selma to Montgomery March] and all that.  How did that affect what you were doing or did any of the people involved in the civil rights come in your club?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we had problems.  They would come in and one night a guy came in--it was about four of them and they came in and sat in the club, and that was before we bought our club.  We were at the Carousel [Carousel Club, Indianapolis, Indiana] and Count [HistoryMaker Lessly "Count" Fisher] reads lips, he used to could read lips.  And so these guys were sitting there and they were from Tennessee or somewhere and he made a remark about what he could do with me but he called me a black bitch.
Speaker 1: This is one of the guys?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: These are four white guys?
Speaker 2: Yeah, four white guys.  And Chuck [Chuck Bush] said--saxophone player said to Count, "Count did you hear that?"  Count said, "Yeah."  Well, Count kept on playing and he said something else, I don't know what it was but (unclear).  All of a sudden Count quit playing and he got up and walked over to the table and he said to him, "That lady that you just called a name is my wife."  He said, "What would you say if I called the lady sitting here the same thing?"  And he said, "If you were in Tennessee, you wouldn't even be talking to me."  And he said something else to Count, I don't know what it was, and Count hit him.  And when he hit him, the woman jumped up and said, "Call the police," and it was two policemen sitting on the couch and one got up and walked to her and said, "I am the police and I saw what happened."  And he said, "I think y'all should get up and leave."
Speaker 1: So he wasn't in Tennessee anymore.
Speaker 2: Unh-uh, that's what he told him, he said, I think you should get up and you should leave.  So, and then Count ran into a few things like that, but we would get them every once in a while or someone would come in and say, "Sing a blues," and I would say, "I'm not a blues singer."  And they would say, "Well, you're black aren't you," you know, or something like that.  So we'd get it, sometime we laugh it off other times we--
Speaker 1: So it's interesting, now, this is when probably this is a black-owned club near downtown Indianapolis [Indiana] with a mixed audience.  Is this like the first time something like this happened where black people actually owned a club and--'cause you know you hear about the old Cotton Club [New York, New York] but that was owned by whites with black entertainment, populated by white patrons, but, you know, in other kind of situations, but is this--did you have the only club like that in Indianapolis (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It was just that, at that time, I guess the movement was, you know.
Speaker 1: But did you have the only club in Indianapolis that was owned by black that had a black and white clientele coming inside to see the show?
Speaker 2: No, I don't think so, I don't think so.  There were a couple of other clubs.
Speaker 1: Were there any other clubs owned by blacks?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, yeah.  But they would--we ran into about every once and a while, yeah, every once and a while.  Sometime you get angry and say something and other times you pass it by.
Speaker 1: Do you think that the white patrons realized that the club was owned by black people?
Speaker 2: I don't know 'cause when we got our club, I know one night a guy came in and the shake dancer was up dancing and he was in the back and he was doing things that he wasn't supposed to do.  And Count went back there and caught him so I, you know, I don't know whether they were thinking, well, hey, this is black or and I can do what I want in here, or, I don't know.
Story_ID: 481818
Speaker 1: Did you have any trouble from the syndicate or the mob?
Speaker 2: No. Unh-uh, unh-uh.
Speaker 1: I know they tend to follow money, you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah, no, no, we didn't have no problem with that.
Speaker 1: Okay, you hear people say that they think that all entertainers have like some kind of mob connection.  The mob, you know, wants a cut of all their earnings and that sort of thing.
Speaker 2: Well, usually you find that when you're out on the road, you know.  But right there in Indianapolis [Indiana] we didn't have too much of that.
Story_ID: 481819
Speaker 1: So we're about 19--so--say the Count's [HistoryMaker Lessly "Count" Fisher] mother [Ruby Mosby Fisher] was ill and--
Speaker 2: So that was in 1966, we came here.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, was the Count's mother living here then?
Speaker 2: She lived in Muskegon [Michigan].
Speaker 1: Okay, so but you moved to Grand Rapids [Michigan]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we couldn't stand Muskegon.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now, what was wrong with Muskegon?
Speaker 2: What they say, they roll the sidewalks up at six o'clock (laughter), and the children start crying, and I was crying.  So his brother brought us here to Grand Rapids and he say, "Well, maybe you like to live here" so this is where--but we started to leave and go to Canada.
Speaker 1: Why, what happened?
Speaker 2: At first we were gonna go 'cause they were paying you for so many people coming there at that time.
Speaker 1: To Canada?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You'd get paid for coming to Canada?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, they were paying, and then Count said, "Well, no," he said, "I came here for mom so we'll just stay here."  So we stayed here.  But we were thinking about moving to Montreal [Canada].  But we started working here, and where did we go, we went into the London House [Grand Rapids, Michigan] here.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you were like the house band or something for London House?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we were the house band.  In fact, they build the room around us 'cause it was the Kind Edward [ph.] room that they build and they build it around us.  And we worked there for about two, three years, and we started bringing--they said that we were bringing in too many blacks.
Speaker 1: So this was considered a legitimate criticism in those days?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, so then we left there and we went into the Townhouse [ph.].
Speaker 1: Now, where was the Townhouse?
Speaker 2: Townhouse is here but it's closed now.  Practically every, every club we worked in when we left it they closed.
Story_ID: 481820
Speaker 1: Okay, so the Townhouse [ph.].
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay, how long did you stay there?
Speaker 2: We were in the Townhouse for about a year then we left the Townhouse, we went into the Mr. President [Mr. President Motor Inn, Grand Rapids, Michigan].  Nope, we didn't, Count [HistoryMaker Lessly "Count" Fisher] went into the police department.
Speaker 1: Okay, here in Grand Rapids [Michigan]?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.  And I stayed home.
Speaker 1: Was it hard to earn a living as an entertainer here in this town?
Speaker 2: No, it's hard now but it wasn't hard then because right after Count went in we went into Mr. President.
Speaker 1: Okay, so he continued to perform but served on the police department?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Now, was he the, was he the first black officer?
Speaker 2: He was the first black officer to go into that division.  And it was called the Friend of the Court, and when he quit they have never replaced anybody with him.  So he was the only black to work in that office.
Speaker 1: First and only.
Story_ID: 481821
Speaker 1: Grand Rapids [Michigan] has--what would you think the percentage of the black population is here or what was it then and what is it now?
Speaker 2: I don't know, I don't know the--at first they were saying there weren't too many blacks here but when we first came here and started working there were a lot of blacks, doctors and attorneys, and teachers and all because they had--they started a cotillion ball here where the blacks were bringing out the young girls, their daughters and all.  And there were a lot of clubs to work then all of a sudden everything just faded away.  You don't see--you know that the blacks are here but there's nothing
Speaker 1: It's not like it used to be.
Speaker 2: Not like it used to be.
Speaker 1: Okay, about how big a town is Grand Rapids in terms of the population, do you know?
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Quarter, quarter of a million.
Speaker 1: Okay, quarter of a million people here?
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  It used to be but, you know, with all of the big industry leaving.
Story_ID: 481822
Speaker 1: So, well, after, after he [Fisher's husband, HistoryMaker Lessly "Count" Fisher] joined the police department then you continued to work and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I worked.  I continued working and he would work on weekends but I was working the whole week.  First it was at the Mr. President [Mr. President Motor Inn, Grand Rapids, Michigan] then we left there and we went into the Morton House [Morton Hotel, Grand Rapids, Michigan].  I think it was the Morton House.  And then when--it was called Mothers [ph.].  It was the Morton House but then it was called Mothers.  Then I got hepatitis from surgery and I decided I'd go back to college.
Speaker 1: Okay, so where did you go?
Speaker 2: Went to Grand Valley [Grand Valley State College; Grand Valley State University, Allendale, Michigan], I majored in music and then the last year I decided I don't wanna do music.  I went into arts and I graduated.
Speaker 1: So you majored in music at first?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Then switched to art?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay, now what year did you graduate?
Speaker 2: I think it was 1984 or '85 [1985].
Speaker 1: When did you go in?
Speaker 2: When did I go in?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I went in--beginning in the '70s [1970s].  I went in around '74 [1974], '75 [1975], somewhere around--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was fifty-five years old when I went in.
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Started back.
Story_ID: 481823
Speaker 1: So you graduated [from Grand Valley State College; Grand Valley State University, Allendale, Michigan] with a degree in art in 1985, so what did you do with it, I mean, when you graduated?  Did you--
Speaker 2: What did I do? (Laughter) Let me see.  I--when I graduated--my daughter's husband died and I went to Indianapolis [Indiana] to help--to stay with her for a couple of weeks.  And I started working in a clinic there.  Then Count [HistoryMaker Lessly "Count" Fisher] came to Indianapolis with me.  And then I started working in the welfare department.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, now your brother [Allen Greene] was there, right, in Indianapolis (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, my brother was executive director of the welfare department.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, okay.  So you were there--are there any stories associated with that, you know, how was--I guess it must've been a big change?
Speaker 2: I could not stand it.  I hated it.
Speaker 1: Yeah, after singing in clubs and all that and to work for the welfare department.
Speaker 2: I hated it.  And my brother used to tell me all the time that I was lazy 'cause I didn't wanna work.  And I said, I don't mind working but I got tired of clients coming in calling you names and screaming and hollering at you, and threatening you.  And, at that time, it was--HIV [human immunodeficiency virus] had just come out--AIDS [acquired immunodeficiency syndrome] had just come out and the people in Indianapolis are, I guess, much worse than they are here.  It was spitting in your face and everything, so I decided I didn't wanna stay there.  So we contact the clerk's office and I got a job working for the judges and we moved back here.
Speaker 1: To Grand--
Speaker 2: Back to Grand Rapids [Michigan].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 481824
Speaker 1: Back here in Grand Rapids [Michigan] in 1989?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay. now, how did you like that?
Speaker 2: I liked that, it was good.  I liked that and I was there for eight years or something.  And--
Speaker 1: Okay, that'll take us--that'll be--that takes us to about 1997 or so.  Now, when does Idlewild [Michigan] come into the picture now?  Is it time for that yet?
Speaker 2: Wait a minute, we passed that up.  'Cause we were in Idlewild when I was in college.
Speaker 1: Okay. All right.
Speaker 2: 'Cause I used to drive from Idlewild to Grand Valley [Grand Valley State College; Grand Valley State University, Allendale, Michigan].
Speaker 1: Okay, so you were living in Idlewild then?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, before I graduated from college that's when Count [HistoryMaker Lessly "Count" Fisher] went into--I'm sorry, Count went into Idlewild and became chief of police.
Speaker 1: Okay, so what year was he brought in as chief of police?
Speaker 2: I'm trying to think.
Speaker 1: Okay, well, don't worry about it.
Speaker 2: It was during the '80s [1980s].
Speaker 1: So you lived in Idlewild itself, and what now--what was Idlewild like in the '80s [1980s]?  It had been a big resort I know that (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) A little dinky town.
Speaker 1: Was it still a big resort--
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: --for black people to converge on from Chicago [Illinois]--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, they still came, you know.
Speaker 1: --and Detroit [Michigan]? Okay, they had summer homes there?
Speaker 2: They would come in rather from Detroit, some from Ohio, some from--
Speaker 1: I know it's a lot from Chicago, you know, lot of people from Chicago had places there.
Speaker 2: Yeah, because they had cabins and all there.  And they would come in.  And Count and them went in at the time.  They had lot of prostitution going on and they broke that up, closed it up and everything.  I didn't have too much to do there.
Speaker 1: Okay, so they didn't have the shows in the summer and that sort of thing anymore?
Speaker 2: No, they didn't have anything like that, no.  In fact, the only big occasion they had was an inaugural ball I gave for the superintender when he made superintender that year.  We had an inaugural ball for them.  And--
Speaker 1: Were the residents mostly senior citizens?
Speaker 2: That's all they were.  They would--what they do there is they play cards and drink all night.  And they celebrates everybody's birthday and whoever is having a birthday, everybody bring gallons of whiskey and (laughter) gallons of wine.  That's what they bring 'em for their birthday present.  And then they sit and play cards and drink all night then they sleep all day and they get up around one or two o'clock in the day.  And then you see them moving around getting ready for the play cards that night, that's all they do (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, but the night spots and all that.
Speaker 2: They didn't have any night spots there.
Speaker 1: Did you do any performing there at all, no singing?
Speaker 2: Unh-uh.  Oh, yes, we did it for the--we played for--oh, there's a little club they have there and we played once or twice for them there, but it's not too much happening there.  It's nothing like it was--used to be.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think Mr. Fisher said when we came in there was a lot of corruption in Idlewild in those days and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was.
Speaker 1: --he and the other police officer had to do a lot of work to clean up a lot of the--
Speaker 2: Yeah, and they did--they had what--they had the dukes of hazard kids there (laughter).
Speaker 1: Dukes of hazard?
Speaker 2: Yeah, those kids would get in the car and have marijuana and stuff, and the policemens there would be race them all down the back roads and everything--used to call them the dukes of hazards.  (Laughter) That's the only thing I saw that was funny about it, (laughter) you know.  But Count enjoyed it, he liked it.
Story_ID: 481825
Speaker 1: So you all were there until you moved to Indianapolis [Indiana] again and then--
Speaker 2: Yeah we went to Indianapolis and then--
Speaker 1: --then back to Grand Rapids [Michigan]?
Speaker 2: We came back here and then I worked for the judges, then I retired and then we started working again at the Tratorria [ph.].
Speaker 1: I'm sorry, it's called what now?
Speaker 2: Huh, Tratorria.
Speaker 1: Tratorria?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: How do you spell that?
Speaker 2: T-R-A-T-O-R-R-I-A, something like that--is that the way you spell it, Tratorria?
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  I just thought about that place, I haven't heard them words in so long, like where is that at now?  Yeah.
Speaker 2: It's closed; it was the Tratorria.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's a club here?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was a club.  It's closed now.  And then we went into the Spinnaker at the Hilton [DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Grand Rapids Airport, Grand Rapids, Michigan].
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Tratorria is an Italian (unclear), right.  Is it an Italian place?
Speaker 2: Okay.  So now do you still perform any, now a days?
Speaker 1: We haven't performed in two years.  We are--were at the Spinnaker for a while and then we left, and we haven't tried to go to work anymore.  We were called to go to work about two months ago and I said, well, we'll think about it and so they haven't called back and we didn't call them.  So, right now we're just not doing anything.
Speaker 2: Okay, so basically you're retired and just trying to take it easy.
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Story_ID: 481826
Speaker 1: Tell me, what--we always ask this question, what, what is some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: I hope that the--we would get along with each other, you know, help each other instead of pulling each other down.  Our people for some reason another just don't wanna help each other and we should.  That's the only way we're gonna be able to move up and move out from where we are.
Story_ID: 481827
Speaker 1: When you look back on everything you've done to this point, is there any major thing that you would do differently if you could do it again?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think there are some things that I would do a little different.  I had two or three opportunities to move out--Charlie Shaffer tried to get me to go with the Tommy Dorsey band and I didn't go.  Dorothy Donegan wanted me to travel with her and each time I got these offers I was pregnant so I never, you know, got to do it.  And I was wondering if I had done it, where would I be now or would I be in the same position that I'm in now.
Story_ID: 481828
Speaker 1: You've got seven children, right?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay, can, can you tell us a little bit about your children?
Speaker 2: Well, I got six boys and two girls.  I have--and each one of them is doing well.  I've got three musicians out of all the children.  And my daughter, she's an accountant for Krogers [The Kroger Company], and my oldest boy [Ralph Trotter], he graduated from Davenport [Davenport University, Grand Rapids, Michigan] here and then he went to University of Sweden [ph.].  And lived in Sweden for a while so he's doing real well.  And Ronald [Ronald Trotter], he, he used to live in Alaska and I went to Alaska and worked in Alaska for six months.  So he's in Vegas [Las Vegas, Nevada] now, so he's doing real well.  And he has two children and a little grandchild.  Ricky [Richard Trotter] is in Detroit [Michigan] and he's doing fine, he has a daughter and a son.  Rodney [Rodney Trotter] is Sir Nose.
Speaker 1: This is with the--
Speaker 2: With Michael Henderson and, and, and the guy that do 'Ghostbusters,' what Ray, what's his name?
Speaker 1: Ray Parker Jr.?
Speaker 2: Yeah, with them.
Speaker 1: Oh, he's with them now but he was Sir Nose with George Clinton, this Funkadelic band, Funkadelic Parliament [sic. Parliament-Funkadelic], you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: And so he's with them now.  And Reggie [Reginald Trotter] is in California and he's doing all right, he's a guitar player.  And Lessly [Lessly Fisher, Jr.] is in Austin [Texas] and he has Les and the Funk Mob.  And he's a heck of a drummer, he's been on Jay Leno's show ['The Tonight Show With Jay Leno'].  And he's worked with, with quite a few big guys, you know, pop guys.  And I think I, I've got a nice family.
Story_ID: 481829
Speaker 1: Now when you look at everything you've done to this point, again, what today would you consider to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: I guess my family.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, is there anything I have not asked you that we ought to talk about before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: No, I don't think so.  I'll think about it after (laughter) I'm away from you.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, well, okay, I'm sorry did--
Speaker 2: I was thinking maybe I should have gotten in touch with my brother [Allen Greene] and had him to give me some--I didn't know (laughter) we were going through all these questions.
Speaker 1: Well, that's okay but the last question is similar to the legacy on some level, but, ma'am, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: Oh, I would like to be remembered as a good mother and a good wife, and maybe a good singer.
Speaker 1: Okay, well thank you very much for spending the time with us.
Story_ID: 481830
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Okay, go ahead and tell us about it.
