Speaker 1: My name is Larry Crowe.  I'm interviewer today for The HistoryMakers.  Our videographer is Matthew Hickey.  Sir, can you please state your full name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: Matthew, M-A-T-T-H-E-W, middle initial W, Kennedy, K-E-N-N-E-D-Y [HistoryMaker Matthew Kennedy].
Speaker 1: Okay, and--
Speaker 2: The W stands for Washington, and actually, my father [Royal Kennedy, Sr.] wanted that in my name before he died, he told my mother [Mary Dowdell Kennedy], in honor of the City of Washington, D.C.--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --because he had recently gone there for a Sunday school convention, and he was so impressed with the music that he heard, and he knew that I was coming along, and he told my mother he would like Washington included in my name.  But I don't use it too much now, I just use Matthew Kennedy.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what is your date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: I was born in Americus, Georgia, March 10th, 1921.
Speaker 1: And, sir, what is your occupation?
Speaker 2: I'm retired, and a musician and teacher.
Speaker 1: All right.  You were chairman of the music department at Fisk University [Nashville, Tennessee] for many years, right?
Speaker 2: Well, chairman for a brief period, but I was connected with Fisk for a long time--taught there for thirty-five years, so.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I directed the Fisk Jubilee Singers for twenty-three years.
Speaker 1: All right, okay.  Now, sir, what is today's date?
Speaker 2: Today's date?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: It is March the 13th; is that, is that not right?
Speaker 1: I think so.
Speaker 2: March the 13th, 2007.
Speaker 1: And where are we at the present time?
Speaker 2: You're in my living room, my very cluttered living room in my dwelling.  I live in a retirement community.  We have condominiums out here, and there must be about 240 condominiums in this community,
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Very lovely, quiet community for seniors.
Speaker 1: And here in Nashville, Tennessee.
Speaker 2: That's correct.
Story_ID: 559409
Speaker 1: All right.  Now, before I go into depth, there are five lightweight People magazine-ish type questions that we always ask, and they only require a short answer.  The first question is do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: I'm trying to think, because I, I like many things.  Favorite food?  Oh, chicken.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Blue, perhaps.
Speaker 1: Okay.  A favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Springtime.
Speaker 1: All right.  Do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: No longer.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And the last question is, do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: That I use?
Speaker 1: Yes, sir.
Speaker 2: I'm sorry.  I can't think of anything particularly--favorite phrase.  I'll say, I'm blessed.
Story_ID: 559410
Speaker 1: Now, I'm gonna ask about your family history.  I'm gonna ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's [Royal Kennedy, Sr.] side of the family, but we'll start with your mother's side first.  Can you give us your mother's full name, and spell it for us please?
Speaker 2: Mary, M-A-R-Y, Dowdell, D-O-W-D-E-L-L, Kennedy [Mary Dowdell Kennedy].
Speaker 1: Okay.  And Dowdell is her maiden name, I guess.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: She was born in the rural area of Americus [Georgia], and I'm trying to think of her date of birth.  It was around 1881 I believe, November the 2nd, 1881.
Speaker 1: Okay, November 2nd, 1881.  Now, what can you tell us about your mother's side of the family, about the ancestors on her side?  How, how far back can you go?
Speaker 2: (Pause) I imagine her great--well, I imagine her grandparents were slaves.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: Okay, I was just asking you about your family history--what you know about the ancestors on your mother's side of the family.
Speaker 1: Yes.  Relatively large family; she had a sister [Lillian Dowdell Patten] who was a little older, older than she was, and there must have been six or seven brothers.  Any particular details about the brothers, I don't remember.  The sister went into education.  She taught for a while, and she, she married a physician, and their last years were spent in Thomasville, Georgia.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And of course my, my mother ended up attending Spelman teachers professional school [Spelman Seminary; Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia], and one of her teaching positions shortly thereafter was at Americus Institute there in Americus, and in her class was this young man who later became her husband.  It was not uncommon for the age of student and teacher to be very close; actually, my father was about six months older than my mother when, when he was a student of hers and they became romantically interested and later married.  He was a mail carrier, and in addition was clerk for one of the insurance companies that was headquartered, I believe, in Denver [Colorado], the American Woodmen [American Woodmen Life Insurance].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 559411
Speaker 1: Now, I want to go back to your mother's [Mary Dowdell Kennedy] fa- family and growing up (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 1: --if I can.  Now, are there any stories that are passed down through the family--through your mother or her sister [Lillian Dowdell Patten], or--about growing up, you know, in Americus [Georgia], and going to school, or what life was like when she was growing up there in the 1880s and '90s [1890s]?
Speaker 2: You're right.  Just that her family was considered quite an elite family, so to speak, and the father [Joseph Dowdell] had a rather large farm and became somewhat prosperous, I believe, with, with the help of the boys in the family.  And the boys would get into difficulty sometimes, I understand, and their father would, would have to spend a lot of money to get them out of legal trouble. But the only thing I can remember is that, that they had quite, quite a large wedding when, when my mother and my father [Royal Kennedy, Sr.] married, with a horse drawn carriage and all of that; all the accoutrements of, of a wedding, which created quite some attention.
Speaker 1: Now, when were they married?
Speaker 2: That I don't remember exactly.
Speaker 1: Were they, you know (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.  She, she was--
Speaker 1: --somewhere near the turn of the century, I guess.
Speaker 2: Right, and she was--it was a little late; she was about thirty-five, I believe, so that would have been about (simultaneous)
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) About 1915, maybe?
Speaker 2: That sounds, that sounds about good, and that--maybe 1914.
Speaker 1: Yes sir, okay, 1914, yeah.  Is there any--are there any stories on your mother's side as to how they became well off and prosperous right after the, you know, Reconstruction?
Speaker 2: No, I don't recall any.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I mean there must be some story there from coming out of slavery to, you know--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --being able to achieve some prosperity in those days, which were hard days for a lot of people, so--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Probably with the success of the farm, perhaps.
Story_ID: 559412
Speaker 1: Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Royal, R-O-Y-A-L, Clement, C-L-E-M-E-N-T, Royal Clement Kennedy, K-E-N-N-E-D-Y [Royal Kennedy, Sr.].
Speaker 1: And what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: It was 1881 also, and six months prior to what I gave you as my mother's [Mary Dowdell Kennedy] date.  I believe hers was November, so six months prior to November, and also--and in the area--excuse me (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) In May, I guess, of--
Speaker 2: Perhaps so.
Speaker 1: --May of 1881.
Speaker 2: And in the area of Andersonville, Georgia.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, this is the famous Andersonville of the Civil War camp [Camp Sumter, Georgia], the, the prisoner of war--
Speaker 2: That's correct; that famous cemetery.  The land of my ancestors was adjacent and joined that land where the cemetery now stands.
Speaker 1: Yes, the prisoner of war camp where (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's right.
Speaker 1: It's sort of an infamous place in a lot of ways.
Speaker 2: Very true.
Speaker 1: Yeah, like a death camp, okay.  Are any stories passed down to the family about those days?
Speaker 2: No.  He was from a large family, also.  Don't recall any of those early stories that I can remember, but of course I, I heard the story of how the soldiers suffered there during the Civil War, the prisoners, and how they prayed for water at times, and actually a spring is supposed to have sprung up and, and they say it answered to their prayers, and that spring, of course, is still running now, I believe.  The boys--my, my brothers--the brothers of my father went on into different areas, but the Kennedy family is very well known in relationship to the North Carolina Mutual Life Insurance Company in Durham [North Carolina], and one of my father's brothers became president of that company for a number of years.
Speaker 1: What was his name?
Speaker 2: William Jesse Kennedy [William J. Kennedy, Jr.], if I'm not mistaken.  And his son [William J. Kennedy, III], I think--if he wasn't president, he was--had a very important position with the company as well, and quite a number of the family--the two sisters also were involved with the family, but the North Carolina Mutual is still viable and active in the insurance.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, did they do that from--in North Carolina, or did they--I mean did they move to North Carolina (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, yes,
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Those who were active, who followed that era as a career.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Some, some remained--I know one brother remained in Georgia.  He became a, a preacher and a minister.  That was my Uncle George Kennedy, and he was active around Thomasville, Georgia.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That's where they make the furniture, right?  (Laughter) In Thomasville [sic. Thomasville, North Carolina], famous.
Speaker 2: That's true, right.
Speaker 1: Thomasville furniture [Thomasville Furniture Industries, Inc.].
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So what denomination?  Were they an A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] church, or--
Speaker 2: Protestant, most likely Baptist.
Speaker 1: Baptist, okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Baptist, most likely.
Story_ID: 559413
Speaker 1: So, did your parents [Mary Dowdell Kennedy and Royal Kennedy, Sr.] have a story about how they met?  I--you said they met in class, but is there a story that accompanies that?
Speaker 2: They both sang in the choir of Bethesda Baptist Church there in Americus [Georgia].  He was a tenor and my mother was a soprano, and she had said to us that hearing that tenor voice behind her, as they were singing, would just thrill her so much that it would send chills up and down her spine, and so that certainly added fuel to any romantic interest that they had in each other.  Can't think of anything else; I don't know, I don't know how my father pursued her, but--
Speaker 1: But she taught him in school, right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's right.
Speaker 1: She taught him--she was a--what course was it, do you know?
Speaker 2: That I don't know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: There were probably several on that level.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Spelling and English, and that kind of thing, history.
Speaker 1: So this is a teachers college, or like a normal school, or--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: The Americus Institute [Americus, Georgia]?
Speaker 2: That's what, that's what it was called, so it was a little beyond the--say the ninth grade, I imagine.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Just, just like a high school perhaps.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 559414
Speaker 1: So your father [Royal Kennedy, Sr.], he was, he was a letter carrier, right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: And did he, did he keep doing that, you know, most of his life?  Did he work for the post office his whole life?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did your mother [Mary Dowdell Kennedy] continue to teach?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Did she teach at the Americus Institute [Americus, Georgia] most of her life?
Speaker 2: And later in the public school of Americus [McKay Hill School, Americus, Georgia].
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, okay.  Now, what kind of personality--personalities did your parents have?
Speaker 2: I didn't get to know my father at all because I was just about fifteen months old when he died.  My, my mother's personality was on an even keel.  She certainly was a strong person, because having to keep her family together as a widow took quite some doing 'cause I, I have an older brother [Royal Kennedy, Jr.] and an older sister [Juanita Kennedy Adams], so she kept that family together, the three of us, and each of us attended college, finished college, so that's--and the fact that she never re-married--I, I give her lots of credit for having a great will and sense of direction.  And, and growing up I, I could see that it was a struggle, and I became so close to my mother, and everything that I could do to assist her I did gladly, and wanted to help in whatever way possible.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So did people in the family think that you take after more your mother or your father, those that know you?  Or what do you think?
Speaker 2: I haven't heard many people make such expression really.
Story_ID: 559415
Speaker 1: Now, do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: I think perhaps the joy that I had of riding my tricycle when, when, when I was around three or four.  That's one of my earliest joys, and I had a couple of aunts--actually, they were half-sisters to my mother [Mary Dowdell Kennedy], and they would live with us from time to time, one at a time, visiting.  And they would practically spoil me, I guess, and nicknamed me the Gold Child, for some reason.  So I have fond memories of those aunts and even my mother's, my mother's sister, the one who lived in Thomasville [Georgia].  Upon visiting them, I'm afraid she would spoil me, and I have very fond memories of my Aunt Lillian [Lillian Dowdell Patten]; her name was Lillie.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What was her last name?
Speaker 2: She married a Patten [John Patten], P-A-T-T-E-N (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Story_ID: 559416
Speaker 1: Did you know your grandparents at all, on either side?
Speaker 2: No, I didn't.  I knew the widow of my grandfather on my mother's [Mary Dowdell Kennedy] side, and I ended up calling her Aunt Chris [Christian Dowdell].  I think her name was Christian, but--
Speaker 1: But she wasn't your biological grandmother but she was your grandfather's widow.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, can you describe for us--now, did you grow up in the same house the whole time, or did you move a lot?  Did you move to (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Made one move.
Speaker 1: One move.
Speaker 2: We were, we were in, we were in a small house on Jefferson Street; I believe the number was 509 Jefferson Street.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And later, later, when I was around six, we moved to 518 Jefferson.
Speaker 1: Okay, so same neighborhood, basically.
Speaker 2: Right, right, just up the street.
Speaker 1: Now, did the neighborhood have a name?  Is there a name for that neighborhood?
Speaker 2: Not really.  Now, the 518 address was adjacent to the public school; we could walk right out of our backyard into the public school, and that, that school went as far as the eighth grade, and then later a, a grade was added--went as far as the ninth grade.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What was the name of the school?
Speaker 2: It was McKay Hill [McKay Hill School, Americus, Georgia], and I think that was M-C-K-A-Y, and I have heard it referred to as McCoy Hill, M-A perhaps M-C-C-O-Y, so I don't know which has more significance or more veracity, really.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Now, was the school named after a local (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It was probably named after somebody who perhaps lived in that location, and the school was--I, I don't know, maybe it--whether it was because it was on a hill, or whether it was named for a person whose name was Hill, so I really don't--I'm, I'm not sure about that.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, it'd be--it was either McKay Hill or McCoy Hill School.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: All right, okay.
Story_ID: 559417
Speaker 1: What were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: I guess school was about the most important thing, and being involved with the church was very important because we, we would go to--we would walk to church, which was a good distance, I recall, and that was Bethesda Baptist Church [Americus, Georgia].  That's where I was baptized when I must have been about nine.  And at an early age I started taking music lessons, and music became so important in my life even at an early age, and for the local radio station, I was tapped to play on the radio quite often, usually about once a week.
Speaker 1: Now, do you remember when you first started taking mu- what it was like when you first started taking music lessons?
Speaker 2: Well, I, I first started playing by ear.  My, my mother [Mary Dowdell Kennedy] would sing a lot around the house, and I'm told that one day I just went to the piano and started playing one of the spirituals that I'd heard my mother sing.  I was four years old at the time, and the spiritual was '(It's Me Oh Lord) Standing in the Need of Prayer,' and I just went to the piano and started playing that, and my sister called to my mother and said, "Mama, listen to Matthew [HistoryMaker Matthew Kennedy] playing the piano."  And she said, "Girl, I thought that was you," and they both ran, they said, to the living room and--to watch me play the piano.  From that point on, music was just important in my life.  My sister, being a couple of years older than I was, was already taking piano lessons from a teacher, so my sister became my first teacher, showing me the fundamentals and--but shortly after that, she became a little discouraged, because she just felt that she wasn't capable of giving me the kind of instruction that I needed; I was making such advance--
Speaker 1: And that's Juanita--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --Kennedy [Juanita Kennedy Adams], right, okay.
Speaker 2: And so, from then on, I was usually assigned to a teacher; I had a cousin who was a little older than my sister, who was already attending school in Atlanta [Georgia], Spelman [Spelman College], and she was under the influence of Kemper Harreld, very famous name at that time, so when she was home for the summers, definitely I would be studying with this cousin, Theodis Weston.
Story_ID: 559418
Speaker 1: Yeah, I wanted to go back a little bit and just talk about your disposition as a young child.  You must have really been disciplined as a young child to be able to sit still at age four, right? To--
Speaker 2: I guess so, I guess so, and having that gift for music, which required sitting still and listening to music, being able to control the tendency to, to be fidgety.  And I was just happy being at the piano, and my mother [Mary Dowdell Kennedy], soon thereafter, actually wanted to enroll me in school, in public school [McKay Hill School, Americus, Georgia], because she was a teacher at school, so she approached the principal about enrolling me and, see, I must have been about five at the time, and the normal age would have been six, earliest age for entering the first grade.  But I went on anyway and sat in the classroom, and for that first grade and the second grade, I was doing that well before I was six.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, do you remember playing the piano that first time?  Do you actually have a memory of doing it (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I've heard, I've heard the story told to me so much until I seem to feel that I remember it.  I guess I remember it, yes, because I, I would just continue playing different things from then on, you see.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And shortly thereafter, I composed my first piece, and the way it sounded, my mother suggested that I call it 'The Bells,' and I, I remember that.
Speaker 1: So you would get on the piano and just--and come up with your own tunes as a child (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I'm, and I'm certain that I must have been playing different things by ear--from ear, as they might say.
Story_ID: 559419
Speaker 1: Now, did, did this, you know, ability to focus at that early age spill over into other areas?  I mean, were you an avid reader, or did you--were you good at math at that age?
Speaker 2: I must have been an apt student, because I made very satisfactory progress through the grades, and at the seventh grade they had what was called a graduation ceremony [at McKay Hill School, Americus, Georgia].  My mother [Mary Dowdell Kennedy] was the teacher of the seventh grade, and she considered me the one who would be the valedictorian, and then I went on--
Speaker 1: Well, I wanna speed past all this, that's why I'm asking especially--did you actually--I mean did the other work come easy for you?
Speaker 2: Somewhat, yes, yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I mean were you fond of reading?  Did you read a lot?
Speaker 2: I didn't read a lot, but apt and keen mind--
Speaker 1: Okay. Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: --to retain seemed to have been a gift, so that, so that I, I was good in mathematics; I was good in spelling, and sometimes the teacher--I remember one time I, I was being--toward the last standing in the spelling bee, and the teacher saw that that was gonna happen, so she had one of her students go down the hall to where my mother's room was to tell my mother to come down and see me doing well in the spelling bee; that must have been about the fifth grade and I, I re- I remember that somewhat.
Story_ID: 559420
Speaker 1: Now, as a little, little kid, though, at age four and five, did you play in public at that age?
Speaker 2: Not so much at four, but I suspect at five I was beginning to play in public, you see.  Because by then I was studying and, and was--I was learning little pieces that, that my teacher would expose me to.
Speaker 1: Now, the first piece that you played is a very familiar piece to anybody that's ever been in a junior choir.  I sung it when I was a kid (singing), "It's me, it's me, it's me, oh, Lord, standing in the need of prayer" ['(It's Me Oh Lord) Standing in the Need of Prayer'].
Speaker 2: Right, that's the piece.
Speaker 1: Right, yeah, that's a very simple piece to do--
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: --but, you know, how soon did you graduate to more complicated pieces, and how complicated were they by the time say, you were five?  What were you playing?
Speaker 2: It was probably just a gradual progress.  I, I don't remember too well, but see, during that time I probably continued to play from ear, and then as I say, my sister [Juanita Kennedy Adams] took over to, to give me lessons.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what--when were you, I guess, exposed to classical music first?
Speaker 2: Probably what, what I heard in church [Bethesda Baptist Church, Americus, Georgia]--when I, when I heard the religious music that I heard in, in church.  We didn't own a radio or Victrola, but friends and neighbors did, so that's where I would hear other music, in visiting some of the friends' home.
Speaker 1: So it was mostly religious music at first.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: And--okay.  Now were you exposed, in those early days, to other types of music, popular music or jazz, or anything (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I imagine so, just what, what was popular at the time I would hear those things sung or played by other people.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did anybody have a Victrola around you?
Speaker 2: Yes, neighbors and the friends across town.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So--but I was asking like when were you first exposed to the classical music, as such?
Speaker 2: You know, I can't say definitely, but it must have been in visiting those friends' home where I would hear the radio or their victor- Victrola.
Speaker 1: When did a teacher first try to teach you classical music?  I mean did they do that right away, or--
Speaker 2: The little pieces that would be in the, in the book, and probably as soon as--I suspect it was even difficult getting hands on some music, but I don't remember those details but I remember some of the little pieces.  One composer was Wollenhaupt [Herman Adolf Wollenhaupt] W-A-L-L-E-N-H-A-U-P-T [sic.], I believe, and I played a piece by him.
Speaker 1: How old were you when you were playing Wollenhaupt?
Speaker 2: I was probably about ten at that time (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Story_ID: 559421
Speaker 1: Now you composed a piece at age six, right?
Speaker 2: Right, this little piece called 'The Bells.'
Speaker 1: Can you hum a little bit of it for us?
Speaker 2: You really couldn't tell too much from the humming I don't believe.
Speaker 1: Oh, we can get (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) "Dah dah dah dah dum, dee dee dee dum, dee dah dah dum, dah dah dah dah dah, dah dum, dah dum."  And I played it in the upper register of the piano, so that kind of, I guess, as I say, my mother [Mary Dowdell Kennedy] thought it reminded her of bells.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay, that's an interesting little piece there, that's--so at age six you put that together.  That's something.  So, did they call upon you at church to play for the congregation when you were at that age, when you were young?
Speaker 2: Not that early, I don't believe; probably, I would probably just play on special programs.  But at an early age I began to have a job as playing for the choir, either at my church, and then a couple of other churches around the city.  I earned money playing for the choir and playing for the church services.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, I know that comes later, but I just wanted--so you would play for special programs when you were a little kid, right?
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: A little child--and then as you grew older you became the pianist for the choir.
Speaker 2: Right, but see that wasn't--that moved right along.  I was playing--probably playing for a church perhaps as early as nine.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, did you have a favorite music that you would play in those days?  What was your favorite music to play?
Speaker 2: Just the church music--the hymns and all.  They would probably have little anthems, and they would have probably someone who was in charge of the choir, so to speak.  I was the pianist and would follow what--the instructions from the choir director.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Those churches--I played at Mt. Olive Baptist [Mt. Olive Baptist Church, Americus, Georgia], and there was an A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] church that I played for, as well as playing sometimes at Bethesda [Bethesda Baptist Church, Americus, Georgia].
Story_ID: 559422
Speaker 1: You went to school at the--that school [McKay Hill School] was right there on your street [Jefferson Street, Americus, Georgia], right, up until--
Speaker 2: Right, just adjacent to my house on the backyard (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, it was adjacent to the--and now did that school go through high school, too?  Or--
Speaker 2: No, it went only as far as the eighth grade at first, and then through the ninth grade.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Did you sing as well as play?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Early in my life, oh, maybe around nine or ten, we had a little singing group that--actually, the piano teacher over at the Americus Institute [Americus, Georgia] became interested in our--well, contemporaries of mine, and we had a little group, a little quartet.  I sang tenor in this quartet.
Speaker 1: Did you have a name for it?
Speaker 2: No, we didn't--I don't think we bothered to have a name for it, but it was just, just known that this junior quartet was connected with Bethesda Baptist Church [Americus, Georgia].  And there was a quartet of men that I guess turned out to be our mentors, and I remember them singing quite a bit, this quartet of men, and so they would sing, and if there was a program where they were singing, if we had been able to prepare something, then we would be a part of the program.
Speaker 1: Now--
Speaker 2: The junior quartet.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now, now tell us, in those days, you know, we all know black music is dynamic and it changes over time, and what was the popular music in the church in those days?  Was it the same music that was popular when your mother [Mary Dowdell Kennedy] was in--a child, or had it changed, or what was it like?  What were the songs that you sang?
Speaker 2: I--we really probably just followed the hymn book--those things that were in the hymn book, and certainly some of the spirituals that were popular around the time.
Speaker 1: So, for, for instance.
Speaker 2: I, I--other than that one, "It's me, it's me, oh, Lord," ['(It's Me Oh Lord) Standing in the Need of Prayer']. I, I can't think of many other titles or spirituals.
Speaker 1: That would be considered a traditional spiritual, right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: What they call a Negro spiritual.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I'm trying to think of an anthem that I heard quite a bit.
Story_ID: 559423
Speaker 1: I was trying to come up with the title of a favorite anthem.  During it, during the singing of the anthem, there was a period in it where it said, "That ye may tell it, that ye may tell it to generations." (Singing) "Far away, that ye may tell it," [Psalm 48:13].  That was one of the favorite anthems I remember hearing many times.  And then other things, of course, would have been the songs in the, in the hymn book; favorite hymns that are still favorite hymns in, in worship, "Count your blessings, name them one by one," ['Count Your Blessings'].  And then, of course, the, the spirituals that would--were favorites and--from then on until this day, I'm sure.
Speaker 2: Okay.  I was hoping you--or can you explain to us, I guess, the difference between a Negro spiritual and a hymn?
Speaker 1: A hymn is composed to music, and this might simplify it a little bit but spirituals, music that are handed down orally from generation to generation.  And even now, spirituals that are overly arranged lose somewhat of the flavor, the original flavor.  So that's my thinking, that spirituals are handed down music; hymns are composed music.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So an example of a hymn would be what?
Speaker 1: 'Blessed Be the Tie that Binds,' 'Count Your Blessings, Name them One by One' [sic.], 'The Solid Rock' ['My Hope Is Built on Nothing Less'], famous hymns.
Speaker 2: Okay.  I'm not--well, I know that, you know, most--I grew up in a Methodist church, and there was a Methodist hymnal with songs by, you know, John Newton, I guess, and other people that--they're, you know, congregational hymns from--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --England and so forth, you know, Scotland and other places.  These are the--the music is in the book and everything, but for the Negro spirituals, for the most part, when you were growing up they weren't in books.  You basically--people knew them, right, already.
Speaker 1: In the books probably were spirituals with more or less simple arrangements--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --sometimes perhaps just a melodic line, but I'm sure they were included in, in books in some form or other (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right. That's right because you have a book on the piano by Samuel Coleridge-Taylor--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --that was published in 1905 and has African traditional songs and Caribbean songs, and what they call Negro spirituals--
Speaker 1: Exactly (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) (unclear), right.
Story_ID: 559424
Speaker 1: And you would--I was intrigued by what you said about a spiritual, if it's overly arranged, it loses its flavor, yeah, and I thought when you said that, I was thinking about some of the movies--the Hollywood movies when there's a field and people picking cotton, or something, but it sounds like a choir is singing instead of the people out in the field, you know.  Is that the kind of thing you're talking about?
Speaker 2: Somewhat, yes.  But that's not--I'm trying to just say that I wouldn't frown on that for some of those things that you hear because some names that--of course later, like Hall Johnson, he had his famous choir, and Eva Jessye was called on to do some of the directing of music at--in Hollywood, and I don't know how much I--it was probably some subtle influence I received, but I had the experience of actually playing for Eva Jessye's choir for a short period, and--
Speaker 1: Now that's a black woman that--she was alive until not too long ago.  About--I guess about ten years ago she passed away.  She lived in Michigan, I know--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --but it was Eva Jessye, yeah, so--was she associated with Fisk [Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee] in any way at all?
Speaker 2: Not with Fisk, I don't think.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But she did quite a bit of arranging of spirituals and had a choir, a large choir, which was professional and gave concerts different places.  And I was her accompanist for a concert she gave somewhere in Pennsylvania, and, and as a--I played for Hall Johnson also, for one of his concerts.
Speaker 1: And Paul Johnson, tell us a little bit about him.
Speaker 2: Hall Johnson?
Speaker 1: Hall Johnson, Hall Johnson okay.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.  He, he was a very famous Negro conductor during his time, and very well thought of, and had a choir also.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I was just trying to get a sense of the kinds of music you were playing, you know, that you started, that you grew up hearing and dealing with (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I see, I see.
Story_ID: 559425
Speaker 1: Was gospel music popular then, or were you playing gospel music when you were growing up?
Speaker 2: I, I wasn't exposed to it a great deal.
Speaker 1: I think it was new; wasn't it fairly new?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Gospel music more or less is the spirited, joyful and upbeat of religious music that actually is, is so popular today, and that so many people just don't differentiate between spirituals and, and gospel music, they just lump it all together; I think that's a mistake because the gospel music is, is on its own and it's that, as I say, upbeat presentation of the music.  Sometimes, if you didn't hear the words, you would think you were in a nightclub listening, listening to some of the gospel music.  And the trend now to have instruments and percussion, all as part of the worship experience, makes the gospel music very appealing, and youngsters growing up these days this, this is what they expect.  And it, it actually behooves those who can to keep the spirituals alive, let people find beauty and expression in the simple spirituals that we want preserved, and I think that's a very important job for, for us.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Spirituals are often sung without accompaniment, right?
Speaker 2: That's true, yes.  The, the a capella rendition makes spirituals very appealing.
Story_ID: 559426
Speaker 1: I wanna go back and pick up your life story, again and--so you--by the time you were nine or ten, you were playing--you say you were playing for churches as a regular pianist (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 1: Was it--as a young prodigy, was it easy to get along with adults when they were, you know, in control of the music, and did they ever feel jealous of you (laughter)--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --since you were such a prodigy?  I mean I don't know, what--
Speaker 2: No, I had a very wholesome bringing up, and the people just seemed to want to encourage this talented boy, and they would shower me with gifts when they could.  I really had a, had a wonderful environment of growing up.  Being exposed to the adults somewhat, I guess, made me grow up fast, probably faster than most young people did.  And as I say, at an early age, I played on the radio there in Americus [Georgia], and--
Speaker 1: Now, what was the stations that you played?  Do you remember the name of the station (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It was WENC in Americus.
Speaker 1: WENC Radio.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, and somebody said those letters stood for Where Every Nickel Counts (laughter); it was just a small station, but anyway it, it--they gave me that experience.
Speaker 1: Now, how old were you when you played a--
Speaker 2: About ten, I guess.
Speaker 1: Now it would put you--this is square in the Depression, right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: They call it the Great Depression.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Right, at the very--yeah, it's about three years into the Depression, so every nickel counts; I can understand that.
Speaker 2: That's right, that's, um-hm.
Speaker 1: So, was there a black oriented radio show that you were on, or what was it?
Speaker 2: No, it was--they would just mix me in into their programs, whatever they would have programmed, and about once a week they would put on a program that was rather late in the evening, maybe around eleven P.M. to twelve P.M. and I'd be asked to come and play on that sometimes.
Speaker 1: So, in a radio station in those days, you know--we always think today of disc jockeys, lots of records to play over the radio, but a lot of--you're describing a radio where live music is broadcast to homes.
Speaker 2: That's true, yeah.
Story_ID: 559427
Speaker 1: I wanted you to explain some more about the radio station [WENC Radio, Americus, Georgia]. This is a local station--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --a white owned station--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and how were you introduced on the program?
Speaker 2: Just by my name, as [HistoryMaker] Matthew Kennedy, Negro pianist.  But as things developed, and as I think back on it, perhaps to make things more acceptable to the public, they gave me the name Sunshine, and so in Americus [Georgia], I became known as Sunshine, so.  And I remember there was a program at, at our movie theater [Rylander Theatre, Americus, Georgia], and they actually had the--on one occasion wanted to have a live revue, wanted to include me in it, and so they, they just created a little spot where the organist was detained and couldn't get there, and they, they needed the music going and so somebody said, "Well, have Sunshine play," and this was all part of the little revue, so I crawled over to the big pipe organ, and people were quite amazed that, that I made music on the pipe organ.  However, the young lady who played the organ had pointed out some things to me and--for a special effect.  I, I knew what to do but, but I was such a little fellow then and, and to be in front of that big organ, big pipe organ--it was really quite a large organ--some people thought it was a trick, but it was the real thing.  And--
Speaker 1: Well, they thought it was a trick--that they didn't think you were actually playing it.
Speaker 2: Right, right (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: But--
Speaker 1: But it was part of the show, that they would say, "Where is the organist?"  And then--
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: "Let's have the Sunshine play."
Speaker 2: And they, they used the organ primarily just for background music for the silent films.  See, this was before we had talkies, and they felt that the organ really wasn't being used enough, and they gave--asked me to just come and play the organ from time to time, which I did, and my compensation was to be able to come to all the movies free of charge, so I enjoyed that.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you were part of the regular show at the theater then.
Speaker 2: Not--no, no; this was, this was during the time when they were cleaning up the theater, anytime in between.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Right, just as for somebody (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So, intermission, the intermission time or the changeover time from one movie to another?
Speaker 2: I don't, I don't even believe that because they had someone who was hired to do that, but you see, it would, it would take four or five hours for them to, to clean the theater to prepare it for the next show.  So, that was a good time to play the organ and, and let it get some additional use.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And it was beneficial for you as well.
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now, what was your--what kind of music would you play for those occasions now?
Speaker 2: Mainly popular music I'd imagine, yes.
Speaker 1: For an example, like what?
Speaker 2: There was a popular tune called, 'Home' (singing), "When shadows fall and"--something--"dah dah, dee dee dum."  "Picture a penthouse way up in the sky, dah, dah, dah dah, dah dah dah dah." I'd, I played things like that.
Story_ID: 559428
Speaker 1: Now, did you have a favorite musician when you were growing up, someone that you really idolized or?
Speaker 2: Not at that time, because I wasn't exposed to too many, you know.  The story of my life goes on to say that I went to Macon, Georgia to hear Rachmaninoff [Sergei Rachmaninoff], the great Russian pianist, in concert.
Speaker 1: How old were you then?  What age was that (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) See, I was about twelve at that time, and my mother [Mary Dowdell Kennedy] had a friend who was the widow of an undertaker in Americus [Georgia]; they were good friends, so she was Mrs. Simmons [ph.] and Mrs. Simmons the undertaker, when my mother approached her, decided to have her driver drive us, herself, my mother, and me, and we took along a cousin who was interested in music, my cousin Eula Dowdell.  And so we left Americus in time to get to Macon in time for this great concert, and of course, the white teacher that I had been studying with, and I was studying with Americus [Georgia], was the one who told us all about this, and urged my mother to try to get me to Macon to hear this concert, so (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What was that teacher's name?
Speaker 2: Kate Land, K-A-T-E, L-A-N-D.  She had a very flourishing studio in Americus and when people became aware that this talented Negro boy was--needed encouraging and needed instruction, some of them contacted her; some of the white people contacted Miss Land and told her she should take me on as one of her students.  Miss Land was a little concerned because some people might have thought that she shouldn't have her students exposed to a Negro child, but anyway she agreed to it.  She was a Christian woman and actually she was a Christian Scientist, we found out.  So it was during this time that I became a little more exposed to the classics, classical music, because she had her Victrola, and would play records for us.  Anything that I was playing that she wanted me to hear that she felt she wasn't playing, and giving it something that I could get from hearing it in a record, so I remember the 'Minuet in G' of Paderewski [Ignacy Jan Paderewski] and the 'Minute Waltz' of Chopin [Frederic Chopin], and so when she was aware that this great pianist was going to be in Macon, as I said, she said we should make every effort to go.  And that was--I was already trying to play his famous 'Prelude in C sharp minor' [Sergei Rachmaninoff] and to hear him play it and to see him as he played it, I'm sure made a great impact upon me, probably greater than I realized, but.
Story_ID: 559429
Speaker 1: Now, was it--did segregation present any barriers to you being able to go and listen to Rachmaninoff [Sergei Rachmaninoff]?
Speaker 2: They had a special section in the balcony reserved for Negroes, and the rest of the auditorium was reserved, of course, for the whites, and it was a small section but there were plenty seats vacant in that small section that they had reserved for Negroes.  Of course I can understand it; there just were few, few Negroes who would have been interested in going, but that was the way things happened there.  And even for any public occasion, there would be the section reserved for Negroes.  And of course this went on for years, until the 1960s.  Even here in Nashville [Tennessee], you would have to go down the alley if you were going to a movie, and take the back stairs to the section that was reserved for Negroes.  And that was the same thing in Americus [Georgia], and as I say, most likely in any other southern city.
Speaker 1: Now, did you get a chance to--well, was there any chance of meeting Rachmaninoff for you in those days?
Speaker 2: No.  I guess the adults even thought that few of them would have had that pleasure, and certainly my teacher [Kate Land] had no idea how to go about that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I had no i- no way of meeting him.
Story_ID: 559430
Speaker 1: Did you feel--now this is something I guess you just raised by what you said, that very few black people really were interested and--or were exposed even to classical music to appreciate it or not.  Did you feel--how did that make you feel?  Did you feel that you had something special that other people didn't have, or did it make you feel isolated, or--
Speaker 2: No, I just considered that as a part of the music world that I was being exposed to and growing up in, and I really didn't look upon it as anything special, but it was certainly becoming a special part of my life and my development in, in a way that I was not even aware of.
Speaker 1: Now, now did you get a chance to--did you like sports?  Did you get a chance to play baseball and, and such when you were growing up?
Speaker 2: Very little, and I, I missed that somewhat, even there during, during my public school days [at McKay Hill School, Americus, Georgia].  I, I would be on the sideline watching that taking place, and I remember one occasion, I think my mother [Mary Dowdell Kennedy] must have sent word to the principal--the principal was the coach as well in basketball, because he sent word to the field; he called out to, "Let Matthew [HistoryMaker Matthew Kennedy] play for a little while" (laughter), and so that was really something special and I was, I was glad to go out there just to be a part of that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So I imagine you spent a lot of time isolated just by yourself, playing--or playing with a teacher, an instructor (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's right, that's right--right.  And, and, and it became just normal; I, I really didn't feel that I was missing out on anything.  I would play a lot just by myself, in my backyard; I put up a little basket and I would throw the ball into it.  My brother [Royal Kennedy, Jr.] had come across a couple of golf clubs, and so I, I enjoyed just hitting the ball.  He even helped me construct a little miniature golf underneath our house, and I would play that quite a lot, and charge the other children matches if they wanted to play (laughter). (Unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Charge 'em matches.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, they'd have to give me a few matches, and I would collect those matches and--but that was a way out.  I was actually entertaining myself in playing with, you know, playing basketball alone (laughter) in my backyard.
Story_ID: 559431
Speaker 1: Now, when you were growing up, were you aware of some of the other black classical musicians in those days?
Speaker 2: No, I wasn't.
Speaker 1: I mean, like Coleridge-Taylor [Samuel Coleridge-Taylor], or--
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Okay.
Speaker 2: When I became a little older, I was aware of Kemper Harreld.  I think I mentioned him before.  He was at Morehouse [Morehouse College] in Atlanta [Georgia].
Speaker 1: I'm sorry, what's his name again?
Speaker 2: Kemper, K-E-M-P-E-R, Harreld, H-A-R-R-E-L-D.
Speaker 1: Harreld, okay.
Speaker 2: He was in charge of the Morehouse Glee Club [Morehouse College Glee Club], and when my, when my brother [Royal Kennedy, Jr.] attended Morehouse, he be- he sang with the glee club.  And on one occasion they came to Americus [Georgia] to give a concert, so I, I, I met Mr. Harreld for the first time on that occasion, but I had heard of him prior [to] that because I mentioned this cousin, Theodis Weston, who was a little older, and she taught me piano; she was a student of his in Atlanta.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, sh- so she was involved in classical musical music, too?
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Theodis Weston?
Speaker 2: Yep, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you ever hear of Will Marion Cook?
Speaker 2: Later--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --later in my life.
Speaker 1: All right.  And in those days, I guess Paul Robeson, I guess, as a singer--
Speaker 2: Yes, right.
Speaker 1: --was known on some level, but--
Speaker 2: Yes, um-hm.  I heard, I heard Paul Robeson in concert here in Nashville [Tennessee] in later years.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 559432
Speaker 1: Now, where did you go to high school?
Speaker 2: I started high school in Macon, Georgia for just a brief period, and then my mother [Mary Dowdell Kennedy] and I migrated to New York [New York] and I attended DeWitt Clinton High School [Bronx, New York].  That's located in the Bronx of Manhattan, New York [sic.].
Speaker 1: Now, now how did that come about?  How did this move come about, this move to New York?
Speaker 2: The white teacher [Kate Land] in Americus [Georgia] was studying with a teacher in Macon, and this teacher in Macon, she was a Mrs. Drake, Irene Greenleaf [Irene Greenleaf Drake].  She was from New England, and she had married this doctor Drake, Irene Greenleaf Drake; he was on the faculty at Wesleyan College [Macon, Georgia], Dr. Drake [Raleigh Drake].  But anyway, Mrs. Drake came to Americus to give a concert.  My teacher in Americus wanted so much for Ms. Drake to hear me play, so at the after reception, my mother and I were invited to a, to a local home, local banker's home, and I played for Ms. Drake.  Ms. Drake was so impressed with what she heard that she shed tears and told my mother she would be happy to give me instruction if my mother could arrange for me to live in Macon for a while.  And a local physician who had roots in Americus gave my mother permission for me to live with him and his wife, and this was a Dr. Smith [ph.], doctor.  And so Mrs. Drake, after working with me, said to my mother, "You should try to get Matthew [HistoryMaker Matthew Kennedy] to New York where his horizon would be so much broader; he could hear so much more music, so much live music."  And as it just turned out, this was the time that my mother's grade of the seventh grade, seventh and eighth grade, were being transferred, moved from the public school [McKay Hill School, Americus, Georgia] to become a part of the Americus Institute [Americus, Georgia], the high school.  And actually, they were changing the name to Staley High School [A.S. Staley High School, Americus, Georgia] in memory of a local educator, black educator [Alfred Samuel Staley] there in Americus.  She had--my mother had heard no word about what was going to happen to her, and I think she was just a little timid to ask the white superintendent.  So when this Mrs. Drake was encouraging my mother to get me to New York, it was very easy for her to just feel that maybe she should make the move, and so she took me to New York when I was thirteen at that time.
Story_ID: 559433
Speaker 1: Did she [Kennedy's mother, Mary Dowdell Kennedy] have a job in New York [New York]?
Speaker 2: She didn't have a job.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And she just went to New York on faith, and ended up doing whatever she had to do.  She did some housework and all, but whatever she had to do and--to make ends meet.  She had relatives in New Haven, Connecticut, and, after getting me settled in New York, she went to New Haven.  For a while, she was in charge of a kind of a nursing home for blacks there in New Haven, and then the war [World War II, WWII] years came about and she held a war job with Pratt and Whitney, Pratt and Whitney aircraft.
Speaker 1: Okay, so (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And this was also at a time that, that my sister [Juanita Kennedy Adams] came to New York, or came to New Haven and, and they both had jobs during the war period.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You said that your mother got you settled in New York, and then went to New Haven?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Now what does that mean?  Did you live with someone in New York?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, who did (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) When we first, when we first went to New York, we knew of a couple who lived there, and my mother contacted these people, a Mr. and Mrs. Wilson [ph.], in New York.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So we, we just had a room there, my mother and I, for a short period.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And while you stayed at the Wilsons, she moved to New Haven--
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: --and you went to DeWitt Clinton High School [Bronx, New York] then.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 559434
Speaker 1: Now, how did you like Wi- that?  Was--I guess it was a big change from Americus [Georgia].
Speaker 2: Right.  And it was a big change for me, but I took it all in stride with, with no thought about it, really.  I scored well in whatever aptitude tests they gave at DeWitt Clinton [DeWitt Clinton High School, Bronx, New York], because many people thought that I would not be able to go to DeWitt Clinton because it was out of my living area and district, but my mother [Mary Dowdell Kennedy] had a drive about her that was really commendable; she didn't let no discourage her in any way, so I, I entered DeWitt Clinton, did well, graduated from there as a member of the honor school.
Speaker 1: Okay, so this is what, 1939 or '38 [1938]?
Speaker 2: More like, more like '39 [1939], more or less, when I graduated.  That was about '39 [1939] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, okay.  So you were eighteen, about?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now continue--
Speaker 2: And, see, I entered--at the same time that I was going to--in high school, I was at the Juilliard institute [Juilliard School of Music; The Juilliard School, New York, New York].
Speaker 1: Okay, now where was Juilliard located in those days?
Speaker 2: Juilliard was just across the street from the, the Grant Memorial [General Grant National Memorial].  [President] Ulysses S. Grant is buried there in New York [New York], right down there on the Hudson River.
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's a famous story that: who's buried in Grant's tomb?  They always ask that as a joke.
Speaker 2: Is that so?
Speaker 1: You know, they ask it as a joke, "Who's buried in Grant's tomb?"  And you say, "Oh, well" (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: But Grant is--okay, so Juilliard is across from Grant's tomb?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's very close to that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: About 120th Street, I believe.  And, and near the Rockefeller Riverside cathedral.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Near Riverside Church [New York, New York], we call now?
Speaker 2: Exactly, Riverside Church.
Speaker 1: All right, okay.  So--now who were some of your important teachers during this period of time?
Speaker 2: Miss Lois Adler became a very important person in my life.  I use the Rachmaninoff 'Prelude' ['Prelude in C sharp minor,' Sergei Rachmaninoff] as part of my entrance examination.  Actually, I was competing for a scholarship that they would give entering students.  As I was about to leave the room, this person asked me if I had ever heard Rachmaninoff play his 'Prelude,' so I was happy to tell her that I had heard him play it in recital at--in Macon, Georgia, and she said something to the effect, "I thought you might have.  Your playing is very much like his, and I admired what you did with it."  And a few days after that, I received a letter of, more or less, regret, informing me that I had not won the scholarship, and of course a copy of the letter went to those teachers who were involved with the auditions, and when Miss Adler received her letter, she went to the dean and told him how much she was favorably impressed with the Kennedy [HistoryMaker Matthew Kennedy] boy, and she would like to give me a scholarship as a faculty scholarship, if the school would pick up the balance of the work, the course work.  And he readily agreed, and that is, that is the way I entered the Juilliard institute.
Story_ID: 559435
Speaker 1: Was Miss Adler [Lois Adler] that--do you think that without her influence you would have been able to get into Juilliard [Juilliard School of Music; The Juilliard School, New York, New York]?
Speaker 2: I don't think so, not at that time.
Speaker 1: And do you suspect--now I don't know if any way that you'd know, but do you suspect that Juilliard had a policy about black students they didn't--that they didn't--
Speaker 2: I don't think so.
Speaker 1: Were there any other black students at Juilliard?
Speaker 2: I think actually this student who won the competition, I think he was black.  I think he was from the Caribbean.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And there weren't many; I didn't--even when I started as a student, I didn't run into many, but actually the daughter of this Kemper Harreld [Josephine Harreld Love] was a student there while I was there but, as I said, there weren't many; I didn't run into many, but I didn't--I had no problems.  I didn't think of it as a problem.  (Clears throat) Excuse me.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So that, that's a life changing experience that opens up, you know, the--Juilliard is a--considered the best music school in the country, basically.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, I think so.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  So--that exposed you to--now, did you ever get a chance to go to Interlochen school [Interlochen Center for the Arts, Interlochen, Michigan]?
Speaker 2: Let me speak about this also.
Story_ID: 559436
Speaker 1: When we went to New York [New York], Depression [Great Depression] days, there was a movement where schools were set up to actually help artists and performers, all part of the WPA, Works Projects Administration, or something like that [sic. Works Progress Administration; Work Projects Administration], but anyway, it was the WPA, and I entered the school that was established there on 7th Avenue, and the piano teacher that I worked with there had attended Juilliard [Juilliard School of Music; The Juilliard School, New York, New York], and she gave us some advice about actually applying for the audition and the scholarship; I had left that out before.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So, how did you like Juilliard?
Speaker 1: Very much, very much, and there were problems there.  I look back sometimes and say I probably could have made much better progress if I'd had a piano in the apartment where I was staying with the Wilsons [ph.], but when I first started, I had no piano.  I would have to walk several blocks to another acquaintance who had come originally from Americus [Georgia] years ago; they had a piano and that's where I went to do my practicing, and of course I could do lots of practicing at school, at Juilliard, but it would have been so nice.  And Miss Adler [Lois Adler] knew about that hardship; she brought that to the attention of one of her students, as she knew this student had, had some means--from Albany, Georgia.  Her parents were into pecan plantations, and anyway, she told this student, this student arranged to have a piano, an upright piano, brought to the apartment where I was living, and that, that was a great help.
Speaker 2: That certainly sounds like it was, so, yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yes, yes.
Story_ID: 559437
Speaker 1: Now, did you get chance to go to Interlochen in Michigan [Interlochen Center for the Arts, Interlochen, Michigan], that music camp (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That came quite a few years later--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --quite a few years later.
Speaker 1: Well let's not--we won't deal with that right now--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --I'll just follow my chronology.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: So, you're at DeWitt Clinton [DeWitt Clinton High School, Bronx, New York] and at Juilliard [Juilliard School of Music; The Juilliard School, New York, New York].
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: You graduated from DeWitt Clinton in 1939.  Other than music, did you have a favorite subject in high school?
Speaker 2: I liked German, and one of the advisors, when he found that I was interested in music, said I should study German.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, did you get a chance to use your German?
Speaker 2: Not, not a great deal, really.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I thought perhaps you might, you know, study (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) But, but it--just in the study of music, you know, you have musical terms and the composers who were from Germany and all of that, so I'm glad that I had that exposure.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, was DeWitt Clinton a primarily black school, was it integrated, or what?
Speaker 2: It was primar- primarily a white school--large student body, maybe about twelve hundred students, and the graduating class was, was over eight hundred, so I felt quite pleased that I was considered a member of the honor school at graduation.  That means, you know, your grades had--were, were at a certain level.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you graduated with honors in 1939, then, and--?
Speaker 2: And it--I, I completed my work there at the spring semester of '39 [1939], so that was--I guess it was the January of 1940 because I finished my work at Juilliard in May of 1940, okay, so--
Speaker 1: Okay, so did Juilliard offer a certificate or something, or some kind of--
Speaker 2: Diploma.
Speaker 1: Diploma, okay, all right.
Story_ID: 559438
Speaker 1: What did you do next, after, after that?
Speaker 2: There again, Miss Adler [Lois Adler] comes into the picture.  Miss Adler's brother [Max Adler] had married into wealth; he married into the Rosenwald Founda- family.  The Rosenwald family is famous for establishing schools for blacks in many places in the South.  But anyway, he married, as I say, into this family, and he and his wife became interested in Fisk University [Nashville, Tennessee], and were interested in the Fisk Singers [Fisk Jubilee Singers] and gave contributions, financial contributions, to the school.  Miss Adler told him about me, and that I was finishing high school [Juilliard School of Music; The Juilliard School, New York, New York] and they wondered if I had made any plans for college anywhere.  So that's when he spoke up and said, "Fisk University in Nashville [Tennessee] has a wonderful music department, and we are already extending some financial support to them, so why don't you recommend that he go to Fisk?"  And that's the way I ended up applying to Fisk University, and he, he told his sister that if I went to Fisk, he would ask that some of the funds that he was presenting as scholarships be directed toward me.  They were glad to do that, and he mentioned this to Mrs. Myers [Henrietta Crawley Myers] who was director of the Fisk Jubilee Singers, Mrs. James A. Myers, M-Y-E-R-S, that he, he was hoping that I would soon be coming to Fisk, and if I did, for her to do whatever she could do in my behalf.  So when I attempted to come to Fisk--and it was because of all of this, because prior to that, I had thought I would be going to Morehouse College in Atlanta [Georgia].  That's where my brother [Royal Kennedy, Jr.] went.  That's where most of the young men of the South, if they were going to college, aspired to go.  But the fact that I, I had this scholarship assistance already waiting for me, I went to Fisk, and Mrs. Myers met me at the train station with open arms, and told me that she was going to use me as the accompanist for the Fisk Jubilee Singers.  That was quite a plum, and when it actually came to surface, people on campus wondered how could an entering student receive such, such a plum as that, such an opportunity to accompany the Jubilee Singers?  So, that was September of 1940 that I entered Fisk.
Story_ID: 559439
Speaker 1: Now, were you concerned about the, the draft at all?  The war was getting ready to--well, the war [World War II, WWII] hadn't really started in '40 [1940] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.  After I entered, that became a concern of many people, and we knew that the draft was, was going on, and actually I attempted to volunteer for the [U.S.] Navy.
Speaker 1: Now, why did you do that?
Speaker 2: At that time, blacks were saying that the Navy was the best arm of service to enlist in, but I was rejected because of poor eyesight, so I didn't make it into the Navy.
Speaker 1: Now, did you know about the Great--Navy Band at Great Lakes [Great Lakes Navy Band]?
Speaker 2: I didn't know about it but that's quite possible.  That's why some people were encouraging me to do that.
Speaker 1: And a lot of the great popular musicians ended up at Great Lakes (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Is that so?
Speaker 1: Yes, sir, yeah.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Quite a few, Clark Terry.  It's a bunch of 'em over there playing music at Great Lakes, you know?  They had like two all-star bands that toured the country.
Speaker 2: And that was located in--
Speaker 1: Great Lakes naval training station [Naval Station Great Lakes] near Chicago [Illinois], just north of Chicago.
Speaker 2: I see.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Did you say Terry Clark?
Speaker 1: Clark Terry.
Speaker 2: Clark--
Speaker 1: Clark Terry, the trumpet player, yeah (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Clark Terry.  Yeah, okay.
Speaker 1: Now, there are some others; there's a--we've interviewed quite a few of them (unclear), yeah.
Speaker 2: Very good.  Well, I think--
Speaker 1: I just wondered if you knew about them (laughter).
Speaker 2: No, and I, and I didn't.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But anyway my, my greetings came sometime in 1943, and so I--
Speaker 1: So you were drafted from Fisk [Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee] in '43 [1943].
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 559440
Speaker 1: Before we get there, now what did you--so you were the official accomp- accompanist for the Fisk Jubilee Singers in 1940 when you became a freshman at--as a freshman at Fisk [Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Correct, yes.
Speaker 1: And did you know very much about the group when you started?
Speaker 2: No, I didn't; no, I didn't.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I learned very shortly upon my arrival, what a renowned and influential group it was.
Speaker 1: Okay, and so were you familiar with most of the music that they played in those days?  Had you heard most of it before?
Speaker 2: Not, not a great deal; that was a learning process for me.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And how did you feel playing Negro spirituals after having come back from Juilliard [Juilliard School of Music; The Juilliard School, New York, New York] and all that?  I mean, did you feel that that was like a--I mean did you have any feelings about it either way?
Speaker 2: Mrs. Myers [Henrietta Crawley Myers], in order to make her program more diversified and appealing, she would include in her programs a piano solo group, so that was a great opportunity for me.  And she would also perhaps have one of the singers, or two of the singers do some classical selections as a group, and that also was--having that experience to accompany them was very good for me.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So it was such an opportunity to play these piano solos before the large audiences, and Miss Adler [Lois Adler] was just thrilled that things were developing as they were.  Because when, when Miss Adler knew that my mother's [Mary Dowdell Kennedy] ambition for me was to be a concert pianist, Miss Adler pointed out the difficulties of being a concert pianist.  There were so few who were able to make it as a concert pianist, and she just thought that as I prepared myself, I should consider returning to the South to be a part of a university or college and teach, but she, she was so pleased when the opportunity to actually be a concert pianist, so to speak, as a part of the Jubilee Singers concerts.
Speaker 1: Now, did you--was that your goal then, to become a concert pianist?
Speaker 2: Only, only because my mother wanted that for me; I, I did not feel too strongly about it, actually--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and so I, I looked forward to becoming a--an instructor, probably in a college or university.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you didn't see yourself like Rachmaninoff [Sergei Rachmaninoff], touring the world and all that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: No, I wasn't, wasn't drawn too strongly in that direction.
Speaker 1: Why not?  Did it seem like it would just be--
Speaker 2: Well, perhaps, perhaps the way--perhaps I was influenced by what Miss Adler was saying, because after she saw how I was developing, she began to encourage me to follow it as far as I could, actually advancing me money to have an agent, and that kind of thing, and to have my New York [New York] debut.  But my New York debut came after I had been at Fisk as a part of the Fisk music department faculty, but she was, she was so pleased to see me follow that career as far as it went.  It was difficult to do both, have the concert pianist career and teach at the same time.  And that, that--
Story_ID: 559441
Speaker 1: Now who were some of the other teachers at Fisk [Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee] that you--or some other notable personalities at Fisk that you remember when you were there?
Speaker 2: Anne Gamble [Anne Gamble Kennedy] was a student there at the same time I was.  She was a very fine pianist.  She was ahead of me but we admired each other's talent very much, and she finished Fisk as I was entering.  She was graduating as I entered in 1940.  She graduated in 1941 and went on to Oberlin [Oberlin Conservatory of Music, Oberlin, Ohio] for further stur- study, and as things developed, she was invited back to teach on the Fisk faculty in 1950, the--in January, I believe, of 1950.  And I was invited back to teach in 1954, and that's when I began looking at Miss Gamble with, with--in a romantic manner, and we ended up getting married in 1956.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Some of the students actually thought they were playing cupid for us; they wanted us to get together, but there was already that spark of interest.
Speaker 1: So no cupid was necessary.
Speaker 2: Right.  But my most talented student--one of my most talented students, Carol Stone [Carol Stone Gafford], felt she had a hand in it--special hand in it, so one day as Carol was finishing her lesson with me, I said, "Knock on Miss Gamble's studio. I believe she will have something to show you."  And when Carol knocked on the door, told Miss Gamble that I had told her to do that, that she would have something to show her, and she showed her the engagement ring.  Carol was ecstatic because she thought she'd had a great deal to do with it, and that's all right, too.  Miss Stone, Carol Stone, developed into a very fine pianist.  She went on to--trying to think of the school in Ohio where she went.
Speaker 1: Not--
Speaker 2: But anyway, she is now the chairperson of the piano department at Tennessee State University [Nashville, Tennessee].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now this (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, it was Indiana--I was trying to think; she went to the University of Indiana [Indiana University, Bloomington, Indiana] for further study.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I know that's a pretty well known music program.
Speaker 2: Right, right.  And her teacher there was so impressed that he sent me a letter to extol her talent and to congratulate me for the fine background that I'd given her.
Story_ID: 559442
Speaker 1: Back to undergraduate days at Fisk [Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee] before you went to the [U.S.] military.  Were there any other teachers or other students there then that made an impression other than the one that made the biggest impression on you (laughter)?
Speaker 2: John Work, John W. Work III [John Wesley Work III]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --was a (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now, who was John W. Work III?
Speaker 2: He was in charge of the theory and he became well known as a composer and arranger of music, and actually arranger of Negro spirituals.  The Work family had, had been a great part of music at Fisk; that's where he grew up, and his mother Agnes Work [Agnes Haynes Work], his father John Work, II [John Wesley Work, Jr.], and the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now is he the one who eventually became the director of the Fisk Jubilee Singers?
Speaker 2: That's correct.
Speaker 1: John Work III (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The III, that's correct.
Speaker 1: And--now did you know--was [HistoryMaker] Delano O'Banion in school at this--well, he was--
Speaker 2: He was a student, he was a student and--
Speaker 1: --a student, yeah, of yours later on, I guess.
Speaker 2: That's right.  So he was a Jubilee Singer under John Work III--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and when Professor Work had to give up the singers because of ill health, doctors advised him to give up the Jubilee Singers and to give up the chairmanship of the department.  Dr. Work more or less handpicked me to succeed him--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and so it was that semester when I took over that Delano O'Banion was still a part of the group.  This was his senior year, if I'm not mistaken.
Speaker 1: Okay.  This is in the '50s [1950s], right?  Or--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Story_ID: 559443
Speaker 1: Tell us about the Arm- now you went into the [U.S.] military in 19--was it '43 [1943] you said?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Was it the [U.S.] Army or--
Speaker 2: The Army, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I was inducted here, Tennessee, Fort Campbell, and went through basic training different places.  For a while, I was on the campus of North Carolina--I guess North Carolina State [sic.], but anyway, in Durham [North Carolina]. I spent a short period there, and I ended up being a part of--being assigned to Special Services, Special Services unit.  They saw that I was in music, so that was very good.  It gave me an opportunity to be involved with music and entertain troops for, for a period.
Speaker 1: Now, but that wasn't--now did you--most of your Army stint was spent doing things other than music, right?
Speaker 2: Most of 'em, yes.
Speaker 1: Was it, was, was it--they didn't know you were a musician?
Speaker 2: That was why I was assigned to that Special Services unit, I think.
Speaker 1: Because they finally found out that you were (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Because they didn't--yeah.  The Army wanted to use us to the best--to where we could make a contribution, I guess, because on the basis of aptitude test and all, I was chosen to be a part of the Army Specialized Training Program, A-S--no, Army, S-T-P, ASTP.  And I was sent to Boston University [Boston, Massachusetts] to be a part of this training, so just came from all over the country.  And we felt that we were being trained, actually, to support the occupation troops, wherever they--that would be, France or Germany, or wherever.  And while there, a small group of soldiers were selected to go to a special camp in Virginia for further study and specialized study, and it looked as if this would have been part of secret service work, so to speak, but by this point I was, I was a non-commissioned officer.  I was a corporal, and I was put in charge of this unit of soldiers, maybe about ten soldiers, all white, to go to this unit in Virginia.
Story_ID: 559444
Speaker 1: We were right on the horns of a cliffhanger, so (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, I was saying that I was put in charge of this small detachment of soldiers going to this special tra- camp in Virginia.  They were--as I said, they were all white, and I was wondering what I would do when we get to Washington [D.C.].  We were gonna have to change trains in Washington, and this was still segregation, and blacks going beyond Washington always had to change to we called it the Jim Crow car, the car reserved for Negroes.  And so I said, "Well, I'll just take these soldiers with me since I'm in charge, and see what happens," back and forth in my mind.  But I said, "Well, I'll just stay where I am with them, and see what happens."  Nothing happens; I decided to stay with the, with the group.  We didn't have far to go once we changed trains in Washington, and no, no problem at all.  When we arrived at this camp, it didn't take me long to see that there were no Negroes on the camp, so within my mind again I was wondering, what would they do with me?  And in about two weeks, I received word that I was being transferred.  They didn't give me chance to, to any--fail any course or, or even qualify for anything because I, I just was in the wrong place.  The [U.S.] Army had not opened up at that time.	 And it's so interesting, there we were in an integrated situation in Boston [Massachusetts].  The officers--the Army officers in Boston thought that I would be ideal for this training in Virginia, but in Virginia, so you see, the officers there, the program had not opened up to include any Negroes, so I was transferred to a, to a unit in Texas, and it was a Quartermaster unit.
Speaker 1: It would seem though--so many people we've interviewed who were musicians--trained musicians, the Army quickly discovered a use for them as a musician, you know.  But I'm surprised it didn't--did they not know that you had a--did they know you had a music background?
Speaker 2: They, they knew, because even as, as things developed, as I said, being assigned to the Special Services group again, we were sent around to entertain troops, and I was more or less in charge there, being as much training as I'd had, to help with the--those--the special solo acts and all.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So did you finish out the balance of your [U.S.] military career with a--with the trucking outfit, Quartermaster Corps [U.S. Army Quartermaster Corps]?
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: And did you serve in the states the whole time?
Speaker 2: No, we were abroad, and I spent a brief period in North Africa and, and France.  My longest period was in France, and we were stationed in a, in a small village not too far from Marseille [France].  This village was Fos, F-O-S, dash S-U-R, dash, M-E-R, dash--no, period, Fos-sur-Mer [France].  And I--by that time, I had been promoted to be a master sergeant, and so this was working very closely with the administrative officers in, in the office, in the headquarters of the unit.  And that, that was as high as I could go as a non-commissioned officer, and I was discharged as a master sergeant.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And you were discharged what, in 1945 or '6 [1946]?
Speaker 2: Forty-five [1945] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Forty-five [1945].
Speaker 2: December of '45 [1945], if I'm not mistaken.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 559445
Speaker 1: Now, what did you do after--did you go back to Fisk [Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee] to finish (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, yes, and this, this was wonderful, because of the G.I. Bill of Rights [Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944], expense was no problem.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you returned to Fisk and--
Speaker 2: And actually I completed the course work for the degree in summer school of '46 [1946]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --but I am considered a member of the class of '47 [1947] because there's no, no graduation exercises at the end of summer school.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, now, now you went back to Juilliard [Juilliard School of Music; The Juilliard School, New York, New York] right away, or did you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right away, actually--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --because I returned to Juilliard in '48 [1948] to pursue the master's [degree].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Had things changed much at Juilliard, or were they pretty much, you know--did you have the same good relationships you had (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) More or less the same.  Now, Ms. Adler [Lois Adler] had retired, but she suggested the person with whom I should work.  She actually retired before I had earned a diploma, and she had suggested the person with whom I should work.  And when she found out I was going back, she knew who was there and she suggested the person that I should work with when I started the master's program.
Speaker 1: And who was that?
Speaker 2: Be- prior to earning the diploma, she had suggested I work with a Ms. Frances, F-R-A-N-C-E-S, M-A double N, Frances Mann.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Then, when I went back to, to pursue the master's, she thought I should work with Arthur Newstead.  He was a very well known teacher, and he had, by that time, married one of his advance students, and he had married Katherine Bacon, and she had quite a career as a concert pianist, Ms. Bacon did.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So it was nice to be exposed to his students and to her students as well.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you earned your master's in 1950?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 559446
Speaker 1: And it's interesting that some time, oh, prior to that, Fisk [Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee] had decided that it was too expensive to keep the Jubilee Singers [Fisk Jubilee Singers] on the road, and had suggested to Ms. Myers [Henrietta Crawley Myers] that she do some rather drastic changes or something, and they were ready to retire Mrs. Myers as director of the Jubilee Singers.  Ms. Myers would not accept retirement; she was too deep within it.  She thought she could make it without the school, and she did.  She went on to have a group, and, of course, they were the Myers Jubilee Singers.  I've heard them referred to as the Famous Jubilee Singers under the direction of Mrs. James A. Myers.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So the Famous Jubilee Singers.
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.  And they were, I believe, about to make a South American tour, and Ms. Myers wanted me so much to be a part of that, that she went to the dean and the president at Juilliard [Juilliard School of Music; The Juilliard School, New York, New York] to have them to excuse me long enough to make this tour, so that was a fine experience as well
Speaker 2: Now, now (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) to, to again be with Ms. Myers.
Speaker 2: This--yes.  Now, what was the university thinking?  I, I know the Fisk Jubilee--well, give us some history of the Fisk Jubilee Singers; I--you know--
Speaker 1: When they were first organized, and they made their first tour in 1861, it was to keep the school afloat at that time, because the school was opened in 1865 by the American Missionary Association.  But by 1860 and 1861, the school was in very dire need of financial support, and just might have had to close if it had not been for the treasurer, whose name was George L. White, and Professor White had had a background in music, and it was his idea to train the students to do music to raise money locally.  And then as he heard the students singing, among themselves, these spirituals, and they were so appealing to him that he felt that that music would really be appealing to a larger audience outside of Nashville [Tennessee], and he wanted to take the group on tour to raise funds to save the school.  And literally, that is what happened, although they had ups and downs.  But their first tour started October 6, 1861, and they were able, in a few years, to send enough money back to save the school and to actually have the first large dwelling built for black education, and that building was named Jubilee Hall [Nashville, Tennessee] because it was from the funds of the Jubilee Singers that they were able to build that hall.
Speaker 2: And this is in the--18--
Speaker 1: Probably about 1873--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --I believe the Jubilee Hall was opened--
Speaker 2: Okay.  So the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) started to build.
Speaker 2: --the school used Fisk Jubilee Singers much like modern schools use basketball pla- games and other things to--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --raise and supplement the school.
Speaker 1: Exactly, exactly.
Speaker 2: Budget--
Story_ID: 559447
Speaker 1: And so when, when you left the [U.S.] Army, they were in a predicament where the, I guess, the Jubilee Singers [Fisk Jubilee Singers] weren't making enough money they didn't feel, or--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: And they wanted to kind of--
Speaker 2: The, the, the, the expense of keeping the group on the road was eating up the funds that they were raising.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So--
Speaker 2: And for a while, you see, the singers would open the door to philanthropists, great philanthropists.  Ms. Myers [Henrietta Crawley Myers] had firsthand communication with the Fords, the Rockefellers, and these were the people who were actually contributing large sums of money to such schools, but they still felt that the money from the concerts per se, were falling short for keeping the group on the road.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, it's interesting that Ms. Myers was able to take her group [Famous Jubilee Singers], and it was the same format, and put 'em on the road and make money, I guess, 'cause she did it as an enterprise, or as a way to preserve the music as well, I guess.
Speaker 2: Yes.  It was difficult for her and that group, but she was so immersed in it that she just didn't feel herself doing anything other.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, how did the school [Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee]--did the school have an official reaction to her forming an alternative group?
Speaker 2: Yes, certainly, when it would get back to them.  They thought she was using the term, Fisk Jubilee Singers, and because of her biographical data that she would submit, these places actually would use that so much, so it was a fine line that, that although she attempted to clarify, they still, in so many instances, looked upon her group as the Fisk Jubilee Singers and, and we would see that once we would arrive in a place and looking at the press releases and all.  We would caution her and tell her, "Just make it certain that, that you are not connected with the school," but this still persisted.  So much so that I think the school even threatened bringing a suit against her but, but it never materialized.  They might have seen that, that the line was too fine.  And I remember quite an article appeared, I believe, in Ebony and--where they were getting the two so mixed up, you know.
Story_ID: 559448
Speaker 1: You came back to Fisk [Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee], then you--John Work [John Wesley Work III] was in charge of Fisk Jubilee Singers, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) At, at, at a while there, there was just a vacancy and the, the administration prevailed upon Professor Work to organize a group, to organize the, the Jubilee Singers, and he did that.  I'm not certain what year it was, but it probably, probably was around '57 [1957], somewhere along in there--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --that he organized the group.  I, I think it was in '57 [1957].
Speaker 1: So how long had the group been in kind of a hiatus on campus?
Speaker 2: Maybe about three years or so.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So, at that time now you were back--were you back at Fisk then at that--well, you were back at teaching, right--in '50 [1950]--
Speaker 2: I--as I said, I came back in '54 [1954] to teach.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And act--it's earlier, it's earlier because I attended a concert--I attended an appearance of Professor Work's Jubilee Singers on 'The Ed Sullivan Show' when I was in, when I was in New York [New York], before being asked to come back to teach.  So, somewhere in the '50s [1950s] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, early '50s [1950s].
Speaker 2: --he took over, right.
Speaker 1: So--and then you got married [to Anne Gamble Kennedy] shortly after you came back, right?  A few years.
Speaker 2: Two years.
Speaker 1: Two years, right.
Speaker 2: We married in '56 [1956]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and I, I started teaching in '54 [1954].
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So--
Speaker 2: Excuse me for interrupting, but actually, there was a vacancy in the piano department in forty, forty--'47 [1947], so immediately, almost upon graduation, I taught for one year, '47 [1947] to '48 [1948]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --at Mr. Work, Dr. Work's behest.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: So now, were you still composing music in these days? Had you--
Speaker 1: No, I did not follow attempting to write music so much.  I wrote a couple of popular pieces.  The only composing that I did would have been in conjunction with class assignments.

Speaker 1: You became the director of the Jubilee Singers [Fisk Jubilee Singers] in--roughly when?
Speaker 2: They returned from their special European tour, the first time they had made a European tour, September of '56 [1956], they left Fisk [Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and came back close to Christmas of '56 [1956], and that--and Professor Work [John Wesley Work III] had to go into the hospital soon as they came back, and he asked me then to take over the singers.  But that was his, his appointment; the administration agreed with his appointment the early part of '57 [1957], and that's when I took over--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and when he had to give, give them up.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now when you took over, what was the basic repertoire of the group?
Speaker 2: They would do--the bulk of the program would be spirituals, but there would be folksongs from, from other countries, and he believed in having a few classics, maybe a couple of selections in Latin.  And so I, I continued similar what I had inherited from him along that line.  He, he would perhaps feature a pianist; he, he featured Anne Gamble [Anne Gamble Kennedy] in a couple of piano solos as, as a part of the program.  I generally got away from having piano solos as a part of the program, but I might have used them for, for a short period, either with Ms. Gamble, or Ms. Kennedy now (unclear).  I don't believe I, I ever actually had a solo group after I came--became director.
Story_ID: 559450
Speaker 1: Now, was there a--how would you open the show, and how would you close it?  I know those are important parts of any, you know, show--like an opening number and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.  Since we were including the classical, generally perhaps a Latin motet, or something, to open with, and then maybe English composition.  I remember we would use 'Now Is the Month of Maying' quite a bit, and that might take up the first group.
Speaker 1: Was that like a round sort of--or--
Speaker 2: That, that, that selection not really, but we would use a round maybe within the program, and then a, a group of spirituals, and we would sing the close with a group of spirituals.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Spirituals were the bulk of the program.
Speaker 1: What was it?  Was there one that was used as a finale the most, or the one that people--or--
Speaker 2: I think it would depend just what we had prepared and what we felt was most appealing and might be more of a, a climax.
Speaker 1: Was there a request for one song more than any other?
Speaker 2: I don't believe so, but, but we used, as well as Ms. Myers [Henrietta Crawley Myers] had used, we used 'Steal Away' so often because it, it was 'Steal Away' that we felt brought the attention of the world to the spiritual.  That original group, when it reached Oberlin [Oberlin College, Oberlin, Ohio], there was a convention going on of religious leaders from all over the country, and so Professor White [George L. White] knew that this would be a great opportunity if, if that group, as they were meeting, could hear the singers.  So we went to the one in charge, explaining what he'd like to do, and he say, "Well, you take your group into the balcony, and if there's a lull in the proceedings, then we'll invite you to sing."  So, the story is he--they went to the balcony and sat, sat quietly and just waited to be told when to sing.  Professor White felt the lull; the invitation hadn't come, so he just gave the signal for the student who would lead 'Steal Away' to start it very quietly and very softly.
Speaker 1: In the balcony.
Speaker 2: In the balcony.  And so that just entranced the people down below; I guess they thought it was something angelic perhaps happening, but anyway--
Speaker 1: There's a--well, there's a choir in Detroit [Michigan]--some of the congregations where the choir sits above the congregation--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and you hear the voice come over the congregation, but you can't see them.
Speaker 2: Yes, okay.  Well, it had been an effect very similar to that.  So they completed the, the song as he had arranged it, and that they were accustomed to doing it, and the, the audience down below just, just went wild, and then someone called, "White, bring your singers down!"  And so we all feel that, that 'Steal Away,' is an important part of the Fisk Jubilee Singers' history.
Story_ID: 559451
Speaker 1: Could you give us a sense of how 'Steal Away' goes, for those in the future who mi- who wanna know?
Speaker 2: I think it's very effective to have a single voice start out; start out very softly (singing), "Steal away, steal," then group would come in, "Steal away, steal away to Jesus, steal away.  Steal away home. I ain't got long to stay here."  That's the way the refrain is, then you have verses (singing), "My Lord calls me, he calls me by the thunder," and that's it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, that song has, as many of the so-called Negro spirituals have, has a history that's, that is (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, right.  I've heard that they were using it as a signal; the slaves would use it, and if they would sing 'Steal Away,' that meant, steal away in the night, or this is the night we're gonna steal away to make our escape, or try to escape.  I've heard things like that.
Speaker 1: And it's also, I would guess, just that by singing a song like 'Steal Away,' or 'Follow the Drinking Gourd,' people would get accustomed to thinking about leaving.
Speaker 2: Thinking about--
Speaker 1: Leaving the situation (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yes, yes.
Speaker 1: And even if it's not that night--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --you think about--you were singing about it enough, maybe you might, you know, organize a way to get out of it.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  So, those songs with, 'Follow the Drinking Gourd' is another song.  I think that's supposed to have the origin- I think the origin of that song is supposed to be a man named Peg Leg Joe, who would call for the slaves to meet him in the woods.
Speaker 2: I declare.
Speaker 1: But that--there are others, I guess.
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: What is--so that's one; that's one of the most famous songs that the Jubilee Singers [Fisk Jubilee Singers] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Especially for the Jubilee Singers, yes.
Speaker 1: It's got that great story that you just told, yeah.
Speaker 2: 'Cause then when they went down and sang more songs, they attracted the attention of really the leaders of, of the country.  And there was a Reverend Beecher there who later invited them to Brooklyn [New York] to sing at his church, and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Was that Henry Ward Beecher?
Speaker 2: Yes.  And from then on it, it looked as if success smiled upon the singers.
Speaker 1: World tours, concerts before international heads of state, right?
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: And performed before the queen of England.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: In the Victorian age, there was a--the Jubilee Singers were a big deal.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: I guess to--not to under- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, right, on--on another tour.  See, they went to England and were invited to sing before the queen, Queen Victoria.  She was so impressed that she had her court painter paint a portrait of the singers, and his name was Havel, H-A-V-E-L [Edmund Havel], I believe, and this famous portrait hangs now on Fisk campus in, in Jubilee Hall [Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee].  When it was first presented to the campus, it hung in Fisk Memorial Chapel [Nashville, Tennessee], beautiful, beautifully located there at the front, but when a new organ was being installed they needed that spot, and it was decided that the painting would be moved from the chapel to Jubilee Hall.  Alumni, when they heard about this, hated to see this happen 'cause they were just so accustomed to seeing the--and that was the place for it.  But now, since it's been there in Jubilee Hall, I've had opportunity to see it there.  It looks as if this is a perfect spot for it 'cause it's in Jubilee Hall.  Jubilee Hall is what the funds from the Jubilee Singers built, so it's--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --it's very nice.
Story_ID: 559452
Speaker 1: So did the--were you able to revive the--like the popularity of the Jubilee Singers [Fisk Jubilee Singers] when you took over the group?
Speaker 2: I don't think, I don't think they actually lost any appeal. I'd hate to use the word revive, but it was just at that period.  You know, there was a period of what I think--when I think spirituals did not mean as much to the public as they had meant.  And, you know, at the outset, the students didn't want to include spirituals on that program.  They thought it brought back too many sad memories of all the hardship.  So it was with a good bit of coaxing that Professor White [George L. White] had to use to get them to feel comfortable singing them before the public in their concerts, so the reception of the spirituals, I guess, were up and down perhaps, and prior, shortly prior, to the '60s [1960s], when there was interest in civil rights, that strong interest, I think there was--spirituals were downplayed.  But then as the Civil Rights Movement started and grew, there became more interest in the sing- singing of spirituals, because I guess they felt they were reclaiming their roots and--oh, the, the students loved the spirituals and they wanted to hear more of them, and know about them.  And from that point on--from the '60s [1960s] I, I think, that you had this renewed interest in them.
Speaker 1: Yes, sir.  I know that singing became a part--a big part of the preparation of groups like Southern Leadership--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Southern Christian Leadership Conference [SCLC]--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --and Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee [SNCC].
Speaker 2: Exactly.  Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] enjoyed so much having that support of the singing.  Mahalia Jackson was one of his favorites for leading songs, yes.
Speaker 1: And Mahalia Jackson would often make appearances in cities around the country and, and stir groups up who were, who were part of CORE [Congress of Racial Equality], or NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] and, you know--
Speaker 2: Right, certainly.
Speaker 1: I know she came to my hometown to do that for CORE back in '63 [1963] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Is that so?  Okay.
Speaker 1: March on Washington, and so.  Now the song, 'We Shall Overcome,' is that considered a spiritual from that era?
Speaker 2: I wouldn't consider it a spiritual, but it's--this might be something that I don't, that I don't know about, but it is certainly very popular, and identified with Martin Luther King and the civil rights struggle, so it's more or less an anthem, although it's very short, but it--I, I look upon it just as more or less an anthem of the civil rights struggle.
Speaker 1: What is the context of his--on that last line of his speech at the at the March on Washington, when he says, "In the words of the Negro spiritual, free at last, free at last, thank God Almighty, we're free at last." What spiritual is he referring to?
Speaker 2: 'Free at Last.'  I think it was entitled 'Free at Last.'
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Did you know how that one goes (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) (Singing) "Free at last, free at last, thank God Almighty I'm free at last.  Free at last, free at last, thank God Almighty I'm free at last."  And of course there are some verses that--I don't recall what the verses are.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's a--I've never heard that.
Speaker 2: Sure enough, okay.
Speaker 1: I've never heard that in context; never heard it (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It, it went something like that and I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And I think as old as I am, and as much as I've read about Dr. King, I'm probably not the only one who hasn't heard that in context.  There are probably lots of people have never heard that before.
Speaker 2: Right.
Story_ID: 559453
Speaker 1: We were discussing the song, 'Free At Last,' and you gave us a few bars of that.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Does this song have its origin in the Emancipation Proclamation, or the end of the Civil War?
Speaker 2: I imagine so; I, I, I don't actually know, but as you can see--the way the words are.
Speaker 1: Yeah, seems like that's it.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Now, did you--now, in those days, those early '60s [1960s] days here in Nashville [Tennessee], there's a great deal of civil rights activity.
Speaker 2: Exactly.  Fisk [Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee] students were very much involved in it.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, Reverend Lawson [James Lawson] here, and Reverend Bevel [HistoryMaker Reverend James Bevel], and Diane Nash, and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Exactly.  Diane was a student at Fisk, and Lewis--[HistoryMaker] John Lewis.
Speaker 1: John Lewis was here, yes, sir.
Speaker 2: And a student at Fisk as well as at the American Baptist College [Nashville, Tennessee].
Speaker 1: Right.  So, between Tennessee State [Tennessee Agricultural and Industrial State University; Tennessee State University, Nashville, Tennessee], American Baptist College, and Fisk, lots of black students were galvanizing themselves for--
Speaker 2: Exactly, yes, yes.
Speaker 1: --a movement that would--in fact, some would argue that here in Nashville was actually the--is where a lot of the movement was generated, you know.
Speaker 2: Yes.  Not too long ago, there was a reunion of some of those important Freedom Riders, and, had a very fine program at Fisk just a few months ago.
Speaker 1: Now Fisk is the home of the Freedom Riders, we know that.  I mean the--well, Nashville is the home of the Freedom Riders.
Speaker 2: Yes, right, okay.
Speaker 1: Fisk students were at the core of it, Diane Nash being one of the prominent leaders.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Out of--in the Civil Rights Movement, a group developed called the Freedom Singers.  Are you familiar with them in the, [HistoryMaker] Bernice Johnson Reagon and some of the others?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Guy Carawan was here in Nashville with them, and his music and leading of the songs were quite involved there with the young people.
Speaker 1: Right.  Now he was a white folk singer, right?--in those days (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 1: He was also an activist, and--
Speaker 2: Right; he was back for this reunion I, I just mentioned, as well as Diane Nash and Congressman Lewis and Reverend Lawson.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, how did--what were those days like, you know, being a professor here at Fisk University in, in those days?
Speaker 2: Wherever we could we, we offered encouragement and support through the movement to the students.  On one occasion, my wife [Anne Gamble Kennedy] and I just stood in silent protest down at the city hall, and we were certainly aware of the impact that it, it was taking and were, were hoping for success of the movement.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And we, we gradually saw it--saw things opening up, and on one occasion my wife and I had gone to lunch downtown at Morrison's Cafeteria, standing in line, and a rather large white gentleman came up and said, "You can't eat in here.  They may let you eat somewhere else, but Morrison's is a southern institution and you can't eat here."  And it was so embarrassing; we had to just walk, walk away, and about three or four people in front of us, one of 'em was a Fisk professor, a, a person who was in charge of the German department and--but we, we saw him in line.  We hadn't greeted each other but we, we left to make other arrangements.  I think we just decided to go back to the campus on that day.  But it wasn't too long that Morrison's op- had to open up because it was getting so much pressure from o- from other places.
Story_ID: 559454
Speaker 1: Did you have your doubts at first as to whether the movement was gonna be successful?  Having lived so long in this situation, did you think, oh, well, we're finally gonna (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I'm afraid I, I had some feelings like that because I, I just said, "I don't think I'll live to see the, the change," but then once you saw a little light, you said, "Well, maybe this is going to happen."  And things did happen rather quickly once it started.
Speaker 1: Now, did these successes kind of add a little more sweetness to the music you were playing in the--with the Jubilee--well, to the repertoire of the Fisk Jubilee Singers?  Did it mean a little bit more when you saw these changes being made?
Speaker 2: Hadn't thought of that, but it probably did.  They could probably sing these songs with more feeling, you know, whereas we--they were doleful and kind of sad, as you were always singing of what would happen, and--, "I wanna go to heaven."  And when we are seeing things opening up here, I, I suspect--I suspect there was a change of the way those words could be interpreted, and you could sing them actually with, with real spirit.
Story_ID: 559455
Speaker 1: You, in 1958, experienced a sort of a personal triumph of your own by getting this--a solo--your solo piano debut at Carnegie Hall--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --in New York City [New York, New York].
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Now how did this come about?
Speaker 2: Well, Ms. Adler [Lois Adler] was still encouraging me, and she was so encouraged at the experience I was having in giving these solo selections on the Jubilee Singers [Fisk Jubilee Singers] concerts, and she just wanted to see how far I might go as a concert pianist I believe, so she encouraged me to get the services of an agent, and of course he told her that I needed to have a New York debut, and so one thing led to the other and I was so, so, so happy the way things turned out.  I received favorable reviews from both The New York Times and the Tribune, and so--but, but even, even so, things didn't really open up suddenly or quickly enough for me because see, I was already at Fisk [Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee], on the Fisk faculty, when I made the debut there in '58 [1958], so if it had been an overwhelming success, I guess I would have had big headlines and all that.  And that, that didn't happen, and I, I couldn't even think of giving up my teaching to pursue just the concert career, but it was nice to have, it was nice to give a few more concerts and use the comments from the critics that I had earned.
Speaker 1: Were your students proud of you?
Speaker 2: Very much so.  And the faculty would give faculty recitals also, as a part of the year's activities; those were very well received.  But I was finding it difficult as, as, as involved I was now as director of the Jubilee Singers, to keep up my repertoire as a pianist, so that, that had to suffer as a great--as a consequence.
Speaker 1: Now, did your mother [Mary Dowdell Kennedy] get a chance to hear you?
Speaker 2: Yes, she was present for that debut, yes, very, very happy.  I think she felt that her dreams had been fulfilled.
Speaker 1: That must have been wonderful to have her there (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 559456
Speaker 1: When you came back to campus, you more or less concentrated on the Jubilee Singers [Fisk Jubilee Singers] and teaching.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And you taught--you were director of the Jubilee Singers for quite a number of years, right, 'til--?
Speaker 2: For twenty-three years.  Now, there were a couple of interruptions because I was on the Fisk [Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee] faculty, so to speak, as a--from '54 [1954] until '86 [1986], you see.  So approximately thirty, approximately thirty-three years on the Fisk faculty, but twenty-three years of those as director of the Jubilee Singers.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  From roughly, I guess, from 1957 to--what?
Speaker 2: I, I interrupted one time just to pursue doctoral study, so I just took, took leave.  And on another occasion I, I just asked to be relieved as director because I was disenchanted at the way the administration supported me in one (laughter) instance, so I resigned as director of the Jubilee Singers.  And interestingly enough, when they were about to celebrate their centennial, I was not director, but the person who was director left somewhat suddenly.  He was offered another position at another place, and I was asked by the president to come back onboard, and he was telling me they expected to do great things in celebration of the centennial, and I accepted that invitation and came back.
Speaker 1: Okay.  How has it been to serve on the faculty of Fisk University this (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Excuse me?
Speaker 1: I guess Fisk University and Howard University [Washington, D.C.], some consider them the two top black universities [HBCUs] in the country with, at one time, stellar faculty members, you know.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Do you remember the other faculty members here, and their contributions?  Was it, was it--you know, how was it to be on a faculty of that stature?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Well, when I first came aboard, you know, you had people like Arna Bontemps as the librarian; St. Elmo Brady, a great chemist, was in the chemistry department; and our dean of the chapel, Dr. Faulkner [William J. Faulkner], was quite respected throughout the nation.  So it, it was--you felt that you were in great company being a part of, of that.
Speaker 1: And Aaron Douglas who was a great artist (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Aaron Douglas, exactly.
Speaker 1: --and many others, but--now, you retired in 1986?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And there, I had retired in '85 [1985], but the new president [HistoryMaker Henry Ponder] called upon me to come and take the singers for a year because the current director there had accepted a, a position elsewhere, so I, I came aboard in '85 [1985] to be in charge of the singers for that year, '85 [1985], '86 [1986].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 559457
Speaker 1: Now, you were--served on the faculty of Interlochen music school in Michigan [Interlochen Center for the Arts, Interlochen, Michigan] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That was just for--right, that, that was just for one summer; I was invited up to be on the piano faculty there but, but that was a very--what shall I say?  It was important, and it certainly looked important on, on anyone's resume to have been at Interlochen.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And you've also served as a chairman of the music department, I think '75 [1975] to '78 [1978], right?  Here at Fisk [Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee]?
Speaker 2: Those years might be confusing 'cause I don't--I wasn't chairman that long--brief period I was chairman, maybe a year.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And what we--what was the--I guess after Professor Work [John Wesley Work III], or maybe the one who followed him, it seemed to have become standard that you would let the chairmanship rotate, so as I would be chairman, another person on the faculty who was more or less a, a senior faculty member, would accept it if the other colleagues wanted him to, so it became my turn, more or less, to serve as chairman.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 559458
Speaker 1: You released your first CD ['Familiar Favorites'] in 19--in 2003, it says here, right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Is this the first time you recorded a body of work?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Right.  And so many people and friends, but people at my church, First Baptist Church, Capitol Hill [Nashville, Tennessee], said, "You should record some of your music so that we could have it as a permanent record," and that had been going on for a while, and actually toward the remaining days of my wife's [Anne Gamble Kennedy] life, I decided to get some things on tape, and then on record.  She died in June of 2001, and the work was completed on this CD in '03 [2003].  I dedicated it to her memory, and dedicated it--included our daughter [Nina Kennedy] in that dedication.
Story_ID: 559459
Speaker 1: Sir, when you look at everything you've done to this point, is there any major thing that you would do differently?
Speaker 2: (Pause) I can't think of anything that I would do differently.  It's--I thought I was applying myself, say, in my practice.  Perhaps I could have tried a little harder, worked a little longer, but as far as the course of my life, I think I've followed just about what I should have.
Story_ID: 559460
Speaker 1: Now, you're on the board of the John W. Work Foundation [John W. Work III Memorial Foundation, Nashville, Tennessee]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Can you tell us about that?
Speaker 2: Shortly after he [John Wesley Work III] died, his widow [Edith McFall Work] just thought something like that should be done, and she was a member of The Links [The Links, Incorporated], that very strong community oriented organization of women.  I think she approached them and they were in agreement, and I think they gave her a sizeable grant, maybe about ten thousand dollars as seed money, and so the foundation just grew from that.  She wanted me to be involved and she wanted my wife [Anne Gamble Kennedy] to be involved because we had been students of Professor Work, and so we are pleased that it's growing, and we are able to give at least a couple of scholarships annually to deserving students, and we are hoping, you know, to encourage students who are interested in Afro American music, as well as, as others.
Story_ID: 559461
Speaker 1: Well, speaking of students, you mentioned Carol Stone [Carol Stone Gafford] earlier, but who have been some of the other students of yours that you're the proudest of?  I don't wanna get you in trouble, but--
Speaker 2: Yes.  There's a student--it's hard for me to sometimes come up with their names because we, we call her Ginger [ph.] (laughter).  She lives here in Nashville [Tennessee].  She's a--she hasn't attempted to pursue music so much, but she has established two pre-school schools and being very successful with that.  Another one of my students, George Cooper, who's in Chicago [Illinois], is doing quite well, very gifted.  I guess I should take time out and try to list that so I can answer that kind of question more easily (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, it was just a, you know, just a question; it's not a--I know you can't remember all the names, but--
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: --but that's--I know there must be quite a few of them and--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --many students that have probably benefitted from--
Speaker 2: Right, and those who didn't actually study piano with me, the experience of being in the singers [Fisk Jubilee Singers] also influenced them.  We have one, Derrick Lee, who actually works very carefully with [HistoryMaker] Bobby Jones.  He's the one that you see at the keyboard.
Speaker 1: The 'Bobby Jones Gospel'--yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, right; that, that young man at the keyboard is Derrick Lee; he was in the singers for a few years, and I have one who sang backup, a young woman was backup with The Judds for a number of years, and her name escapes me right now; I'm so sorry.  And we have Reverend Dr. Sherman Tribble, who was talented in music; he's pastor of a church here in Nashville.  So it goes that way.
Speaker 1: You know, we mentioned one person who was a student; I suppose he--was he a student of yours, a [HistoryMaker] Delano O'Banion?
Speaker 2: Yes, as I said, he was with Professor Work [John Wesley Work III], and under my direction for one semester, his final semester here.  He's very gifted, has a lovely bass voice, and Delano has organized a group that he calls the John W. Work Chorale, so that's quite a worthwhile endeavor.  That's in Chicago.
Speaker 1: I think for many years he was a music director for Marshall High School [John Marshall Metropolitan High School] in Chicago.
Speaker 2: Right, okay.

Speaker 1: When you look back on everything you've done to this point, what today would you consider to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: It would be what the young people will carry on, perhaps, and having been exposed to things that I was trying to do and instill in them; that, that, that's a great legacy for the young people to carry on.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And we always ask this question.  What are some of your hopes and concerns for the black community today?
Speaker 2: (Pause) I would hope that we would always consider the strong influence of a well rounded education, and I think we need to instill in our coming generations, the youngest, how important education is, how important discipline is.  If, if you're attempting to achieve something, you must discipline yourself to work at it, and have the patience to work diligently toward a, a goal--an important goal that you might have established.  And when you just build upon a foundation that's well supported by the proper education and discipline and et cetera, you're gonna build a, a black community that's able to be successful in the financial world, in the scientific world, in, in many areas where our presence is not as strong as it, it might be.  It would be wonderful if, if we are prepared, prepared for the opportunities as the opportunities open up.

Speaker 1: Did you have any children?
Speaker 2: I have one daughter--
Speaker 1: (Unclear). Okay--that's right.
Speaker 2: --and her daught- her name is Nina [Nina Kennedy], N-I-N-A.  We pronounce it Nina because she was named for her grandmother; she was named for my wife's mother, and she pronounced it as Nina.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, I understand your daughter is preparing a film, right, on your life (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, I was very honored that she decided to do this, and it came upon her more or less out of frustration that she was trying to put some order into all the things that we had held onto, I'd held onto the photographs and the newspaper clippings.  I hadn't had any opportunity, or maybe didn't take the time, but she's found these things just in boxes, and after her mother's [Anne Gamble Kennedy] death, this was really a problem for her.  But then she said, "Something should be done with all this material," and that's where the idea came upon her that she would try to make a documentary on my life, and I'm happy to say that she stuck with it, and that documentary is gonna have its world premiere.  I believe, I believe this will be the first one.  She was hoping that the Berlin Film Festival [Berlin International Film Festival, Berlin, Germany] would have--it would have gone through there, but we didn't make the deadlines, and the Nashville Film Festival is going to show it on February 19th, and we believe that's going to be the world premiere.  I said February?  I mean, I mean April, April 19th, 2007.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what's the name of the film?  Is it--
Speaker 2: Right now she calls it 'Matthew Kennedy: One Man's Journey.'

David Baker, I think, has one in Florida, [HistoryMaker] Samuel Floyd in Chicago (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) (Unclear), right. Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: --to musicologists that are trying to archive black music.
