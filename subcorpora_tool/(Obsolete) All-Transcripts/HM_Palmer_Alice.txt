Speaker 1: My name is Alice J. Palmer, and I represented the--
Speaker 2: The spelling, sorry.
Speaker 1: Sorry.  A-L-I-C-E, J., P-A-L-M-E-R.  I represented the 13th District on the south side of Chicago roughly from 47th Street south/southeast and--Is that sufficient?  I began in--Actually, I was appointed the first time when Senator Richard [H.] Newhouse, one of our most excellent senators, had to step down.  It's a fascinating quick story.  Of course, at that point, the ward committeeman then must choose a successor and they vote by proportional voting, which means you vote exactly as your constituents voted in the election that last elected the seated senator.  In that case, it became very interesting, because it was going to be between me and someone else.  It turned out--It was not my choice.  I was very happy being the Executive Director of Cities and Schools at that point, and running a non-profit organization for at-risk young people.  I had been elected ward committeeman in 1988 in the aftermath of Harold's [Harold Washington] death.  If you recall, the first election that came along was one for ward committeeman.  So people who were very unhappy about the outcome of that December 2nd or 3rd meeting at City Hall, across the city said let's put some other folk in.  Again, I had no intention of running.  In fact, my husband [Edward L. "Buzz" Palmer] was the first one they asked at 11:00 at night.  He said no, he didn't want to.  They said, what about you?  My husband said, you can't win that, and I said I'll run.  We ran it out of my basement.  I think I spent $500 entirely and ended up being elected.  Anyway, this grouping of ward committeemen chose the successor and I ended up on a Thursday night being elected by the ward committeemen and on a Monday making my way to Springfield in the heat of the 1991 session, which you may recall was one of the longest in history.  I had the foresight, thank goodness, to go and get my card that identified me from Phil Rock, who was then [Illinois Senate] president before I went down, because we got caught in one of those police traps on the way down and of course, my husband who was a former policeman was not thrilled with this, but a colleague was with us, a good friend, who had been one of Senator Paul Simon's right hand people.  He said stay calm, Alice do you have your card?  And I said yes.  So when we were stopped, he said show the man your card.  I showed the man and he said yes ma'am, and that was the end of that.  I got down there and I had all these elaborate plans to be sworn in with the pastor and all that and they said if you don't mind, let's do that later, you're needed on the floor, do you swear, yes.  I got on the floor and it was a full day with no preparation, nothing.  Afterwards--That's why I was laughing when I told you I'd been a politician before I was ever elected.  Some of the senior staff said how did you manage? You've never been here, you don't know anything about this.  I said I came out of university and there are no deeper politics than those in universities, so I'm very much at home.

Speaker 1: My mother was Mary [Roena] Ward Roberts and my father was Erskine Goode Roberts.  My mother grew up in Indianapolis, Indiana and was born there.  My father was born in Cambridge, Massachusetts.  My father graduated with a masters degree from MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology] in the 1930s in engineering, put himself through school as a red cap and as a waiter.  My mother tells a wonderful story about his final exam.  I think he had to be one of course, at that time, I wouldn't even say a handful of black people to come out of there with a masters in architectural engineering.  In the '30s [1930s], it was extraordinary.  He went to his final exam, of course, in his waiter's uniform.  I could picture that and always could.  He met my mother at Tuskegee Institute, which--I have to shift to my grandparents.  My grandfather [Joseph Henry Ward] was a slave.  He kept the horn that was his responsibility to call the slaves in from the fields when he was a little boy.  He had a goat horn that he kept on the wall of the den that he and my grandmother [Zella Louise Locklear Ward] lived.  He migrated to Indianapolis.  The migration patterns of black people are fascinating in this country.  He came from Wilson, North Carolina, brought his mother.  Now, his brother--we're all shades and so forth.  He was very fair and his brother, who had also been a slave, went to Philadelphia and passed for white.  My grandfather was fully and totally committed to being black when he came to Indianapolis.  He couldn't read or write.  He mopped floors up and down Indiana Avenue and finally someone took an interest in him and he went to high school when he was twenty, and then after that, he went to what turned into Indiana University Medical School, but it was a school almost like the herbalists and so forth now, who work with natural plants, and that kind of thing.  Then he went to medical school and became a doctor and he met my grandmother.  She was a teacher and her people--I'm still investigating this, but it looks as if they might have been all black and Lumbee Indian.  I remember in high school, I went to one rather like New Trier [Township High School] and of course, about the fourth class after the Brown v. The Board [of Education, Topeka, Kansas], so we were still not completely welcome.  I remember my freshman English teacher--I was the only black in the class--saying to me for my first assignment well, Alice you don't have to write a family history, because I know colored people don't have any history, and I went crying to my grandmother and I never heard her curse before, who grabbed me by the hand, took me to the attic and pulled all this stuff down.  Unfortunately it is missing and that's lots of other reasons.  One of them was a paper that had been signed by the governors of territories and that's when I learned that there was a deeper history, that she and her family had passed through territories with this free paper to allow them to go to and settle in Bedford, Indiana, because her father was a cleaner and dyer and that was a needed skill.  Then she went to Indianapolis and went to Normal School and was teaching when she and my grandfather met.  In addition, my grandfather, although he was far too old, signed up to serve in World War I and did so.  I have pictures of him in a fascinating book.  Two colored women in the American Expeditionary Forces were there and have put pictures of him in their book.  This is a book from the 1920 edition.  He went over there to serve on the battlefields in France and entered as a major and came out as a colonel.  At the end of that time, if you remember Robert Moten went over to France to meet with the black soldiers, and Jackie Taylor, I remember one of her early plays was 1919 about the return of black soldiers to Chicago and the consequences of that.  They met and later on when one of the issues that black soldiers raised was the health care they were receiving when they were wounded.  So President Moten of Tuskegee at the time, successor to Booker T. Washington, began to raise the issue that it was time to put a black person in charge of the veteran's hospital at Tuskegee, because it was the only one there that was serving black soldiers.  This got raised all the way to the President of the United States and my grandfather was chosen to be the first black to head Tuskegee's Veteran's Hospital.  So that's how the family ended up going there.  My grandparents had had two children, my uncle Buddy, my mother's brother.  He died when he was 12 during the 1919 influenza attack across the world and died in my grandmother's arms.  They were all three sick, but my mother and grandmother survived, and they said that they couldn't even go to the funeral they were so ill, so they had to watch him being carried from the house from the window.  Anyway, that's how they ended up at Tuskegee and my parents--my mother, before she met him, had gone to Denver University [University of Denver] and graduated in theater arts in 1934, I think.  Something like that.  Then came back.  She also went to Spelman [College] interestingly.  Spelman had a boarding school in the early days.  This is in addition to it being a college, before it became a college, it was a girl's boarding school.  My mother went to school there.  If you go into the oldest Spelman building on campus and go down into the basement, you'll see  a picture of her with Shirley Temple curls when she was a youngster.  She did not like it, didn't want to be away from her family and so insisted on going back to Tuskegee, which also of course, had a high school and she graduated from there and went on to Denver.  George Crockett who was a congressman later in Detroit, the two of them knew each other during this period of time.  I can't remember if he was at Tuskegee, I think so, and then later at Morehouse [College].  That's how they got together and of course, my father then--When he graduated taught at Howard [University] in their engineering department at Lincoln University and then at Tuskegee and that's how he and my mother met.

Speaker 1: One other thing I have to tell you is this has been such a thrill for me.  My grandfather [Joseph Henry Ward] was Madame [C.J.] Walker's physician and A'Lelia Bundles, who is Madame Walker's great-granddaughter, wrote a children's book, which my husband brought home from the Birmingham African American museum [Birmingham Civil Rights Institute].  I was glancing through it and at the end of it, it talked about Dr. Joseph Ward attending Madame Walker in her later years, and so forth.  I thought this is interesting, it had an e-mail address for A'Lelia Bundles, so I said what the hey.  I e-mailed her.  I said I'm the granddaughter of Dr. Joseph Ward and you mentioned him.  We had been in touch over the last year or so, as she is writing now an adult book on Madame Walker and whenever she finds anything about my grandparents, she sends it to me, and I've learned quite a lot in that way and in my office, I have a picture of Madame Walker, Booker T. Washington, my grandfather and several other notables at the end of World War I, standing in front of the Senate Avenue Y [YMCA, Young Men's Christian Association] in Indianapolis, which was the first African American Y in Indianapolis.  [Julius] Rosenwald put up money and said if the black citizens of the town can match this money, then they can have it and build a Y.  So these were the group of people who matched the money and built the Y.  So he went way far back and I thought that was just he.  Then A'Lelia sent me a letter that my grandmother [Zella Louise Locklear Ward] had written in 1920-something where she was arranging a tour for Madame Walker in Ohio somewhere in some black churches and it was really quite a thrilling thing to receive this.  I could hear her voice in this letter.  It was quite exciting, so I'm anxiously awaiting A'Lelia's book.
Speaker 2: Madame Walker, was she also from New York?
Speaker 1: Yes.  She started out in Denver, Colorado.  If you visit there, you will find that she started out--I don't mean the Southern end of her life.  I'm talking about when she really took off in terms of her beauty products in a black owned drug store in Denver.  She also lived with my grandparents.  That's how she got started in Indianapolis.  She lived in the home when my grandfather was in World War I.  I don't know the times exactly, and this is confirmed by A'Lelia.  That's how we started this conversation.  She lived with them and then began the process of putting up what turned out to be, of course, the first black owned professional building in the United States, the Walker Building, which is still there, which has been renovated some ten, fifteen years ago and is the anchor for the reclamation of this area that I mentioned to you before.  It's not called Bronzeville there, but it's the same principle and my grandparents lived there.  I think it was on California Street, down the street from Madame Walker's attorney and it's a fascinating area.  She did.  She moved from Indianapolis to New York and had a villa in which she lived and it was there that she died, and at the end of the children's book that's what she talks about, that my grandfather attended her at her New York residence.
Speaker 2: It was just recently that I heard her mentioned with Indianapolis.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: She was sort of the--
Speaker 1: She was also an internationalist.  Again, this dinner we had last night with Vernon.  There was a black woman, Brenda [Gayle] Plummer, who has written a superb book entitled 'Rising Wind: [Black Americans and U. S. Foreign Affairs, 1935-1960]' about African Americans and American foreign policy in the early part of the 20th century.  Madame Walker had put together an organization called the League of Colored People, which she wanted to affect American foreign policy when it came to people of color.
Story_ID: 11535
Speaker 1: What was your family like?
Speaker 2: They were great.  Sometimes I despair, I think, I'm having--My grandparents' house was always a center of people being there.  He [Joseph Henry Ward] was a hands-on doctor.  When we lived in Indianapolis, he would get a call--There was no secretary, there was no receptionist, that was my grandmother [Zella Louise Locklear Ward].  The phone for his office was on the bookcase in the hall.  His office was through a swinging door.  That's all that separated the living quarters from his office.  So when the phone rang in the middle of the night, more than likely it was my grandmother who answered and he would, wherever it was, he would go out.  My father [Erskine Goode Roberts] used to talk about accompanying him into the farmland area where he would operate on the kitchen table while my father held the lantern.  Of course, this came from the experiences from being on the operating--This was early M.A.S.H.  Operating on the battlefield, so he was used to that.  They were extremely generous people.  There was always somebody--You would go to bed and you never know who would be in the guest room the next morning, because there were always people passing through and staying.  I find that's like my house.  I think, my God, is it in the genes or what?  Very generous.
Story_ID: 11536
Speaker 1: Unfortunately, all of my elders have passed.  My father [Erskine Goode Roberts] was a very Bostonian black person.  He was raised almost a single father household, because his mother had died when he was 12 and his older sister, who was 15, my Aunt Lillian, went to work at that time.  They couldn't afford for everybody to go to college, so he kind of did it.  He attended Boston Latin School, and that's amazing to me.  My grandfather on that side was a postal worker, so he kept his family and apparently education--I didn't know him well, because the distance was so long.  I met him a few times, but I can't say I really knew him.  He was a very quiet man, but obviously education was extremely important to him.  He delivered mail and he saw that his son went as far as he could.  My aunt finished her degree at 40 years old and her masters at 42 and was a superb social worker.
Speaker 2: Your mother [Mary Roena Ward Roberts], what was she like?
Speaker 1: My mother was kind of the belle of the ball, a delightful woman.  When she died here, her funeral, I was amazed the people who came and who talked about oh, I used to talk to your mother all the time on the phone, she was a very charming woman.  She was a school teacher and I use her as an example in my classes.  There was a young woman in my graduate class who was complaining and complaining about a child.  I said how old is this child.  She said five.  I said my God, you teach kindergarten and she said yes.  I said my mother taught kindergarten and what she did was just get a rocking chair and put it in a corner and when there were difficulties, she'd lift that child on to her lap and just rock him for a moment and then they'd have a conversation and I said usually it worked out, why don't you try that.  She was just an extraordinary woman, very strong.  All the women in my family have been very strong women.
Speaker 2: And who would you say you're the most like, your mother or your father or what do you take from either?
Speaker 1: I'd say I'm more like my father than my mother.  More like my father and my grandmother [Zella Louise Locklear Ward].  My father was very logical, very connecting the dots, this goes to this and this, and my mother was more emotional and I'm somewhere in between the two, but probably more like my father and my grandmother, because I spent a lot of time with my grandmother.
Story_ID: 11537
Speaker 1: I have a brother [Erskine Ward Roberts].
Speaker 2: Where do you fit?
Speaker 1: I'm the older and he's the younger, five years younger.  Also education, very important to him and he has a masters and was a teacher and named after my father, Erskine [Goode Roberts] as well.
Speaker 2: I want to go back to any other childhood memories you have.
Speaker 1: I just remember the freedom of growing up in Indianapolis.  You could play outdoors all day.  The street was a one block street and it was a family street.  There were something like 19 children on the block, everybody looked out for everybody else.  I remember my mother [Mary Roena Ward Roberts] told me I was never to ride in a car when I was in high school.  I was absolutely forbidden.  I thought one time she'll never know.  Somebody offered me a ride home rather than the long walk that I would have had to make.  I said let me off at the corner.  Well, by the time I got to my house, which was in the middle of the block, my mother was standing on the porch with her hands on her hips.  The neighbor at the end of the block had seen me get out of this car and of course, had relayed it to my mother house by house and all of them were looking at me and I was so ashamed that I had broken a rule that we had agreed to.  It was lovely growing up on that street.  I still--In fact, one of the fondest memories--There were three of us girls born within days of each other, all delivered by my grandfather [Joseph Henry Ward] at his hospital.  In those days, black people were not allowed in the mainstream hospitals, so he had his own hospital.  Most of the children in Indianapolis, my age and older, were delivered there.  Our mothers were friends before us.  We have remained lifelong friends, and last year celebrated our birthday together in Indianapolis.  Our children gave us a party.  It was wonderful.
Story_ID: 11538
Speaker 1: I was a reader.  In fact, down the street on this street that I described, there was a woman with seven children.  She later became the first black assistant attorney general in Indiana.  At the time, she was a homemaker.  She had a window seat full of books and none of her children at that time were terribly interested, and of course, none of us locked our doors, so she said you can come get books any time.  I had read every book she had.  My brother [Erskine Ward Roberts] tells this story.  One summer, I spent the summer cataloging them and had library classes for all the kids up and down the street so that they would read too.  Kind of a loner in a way.  I guess reading--you could give me five books for Christmas and by the end of the Christmas day I would have read all of them.  Could entertain myself completely by myself.  Imaginative and I guess I'm sure there are other things, but that in particular.
Speaker 2: Did you have any sense that you were from a privileged background?
Speaker 1: No.  We were out on hard time.  Both of my--my grandmother [Zella Louise Locklear Ward] died suddenly and my grandfather [Joseph Henry Ward], who was by that time 90-something.  It was unfortunate--they celebrated their 50th wedding anniversary.  Mordecai Johnson, who was then president of Howard University, was the keynote speaker and it was a celebration of the entire community in Indianapolis and my grandmother, unfortunately she and her sister had had a falling-out ten years before over some other interesting things.  My grandmother was also very active.  She was the president of the board of the Phillis Wheatley YWCA [Young Women's Christian Association] and she and her sister had had a disagreement about an employee and my grandmother broke the tie in the vote that fired the lady.  They had just begun to be together again this 50th anniversary and my grandmother was dead one week after the 50th anniversary.  I remember the night of the wake, my grandfather just tuned out.  He got a chair and sat in the middle of the room and tuned out.  I won't go into a series of very unfortunate--which is why I don't have in hand material things representative of the family, but let's just say that some folks swooped down and took advantage of a situation and we ended up with everything being taken and it was some tough years, some very tough years.  So I have been on both sides of the fence.  I have been comfortable and I've also had to figure out when I was in high school whether my twenty cents a day was going to be spent to ride the bus to and from high school or whether I'd spend it on a bologna sandwich in the cafeteria.  So there have been some ups and downs.  Never thought that I was from a privileged.  Privileged in a sense of the love and the way--what we were given not in material, but in the books and the learning and the people who came through our lives, but material, no.
Speaker 2: When I said privileged, what I was referring to was that you had come from a very strong culture and family.  Was there--I also am struck by the fact that was it your mother [Mary Roena Ward Roberts] or your grandmother that took you to the annex?
Speaker 1: My grandmother.
Speaker 2: Did you have a sense of your heritage or did you have a sense of your place in this world is what I'm saying?  You said you spent a lot of time with your grandmother.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: I'm wondering what lessons she imparted to you.
Speaker 1: Up until that time, I had taken all this for granted.  I went to an all-black grammar school, George Washington Carver, and in the morning it would be Marian Anderson or Paul Robeson singing the National Anthem.  I had gone to what I finally figured out was kindergarten was a black Montessori school run by two African American women who opened one and we were taken there in a cab by--I can't remember--he's a famous artist now.  Unfortunately at the time no one recognized it.  He had to drive a cab.  He had an exhibit of his art down here at one of the museums on Michigan Avenue, but at that time that's what he did.  He would take us in his cab to kindergarten.  No.  I mean we took all this very much--This was just the way that all of us lived and it wasn't until we came in contact with people who did not think highly of us, who wanted to put us down, that we got a sense of what we had and who we were, and of course, that--because of this background, it made me a fighter.
Story_ID: 11539
Speaker 1: I had been in advanced English and we took theater for four years.  This was a high school [Shortridge High School] rather like Northwestern [University] in a sense that it had its own auditorium.  The high school senior play was not just a usual senior play, people went from there to Northwestern and to wherever in theater arts, junior vaudeville, that kind of thing.  By the time I got to senior, we had what we call cuts, which were auditions, and I made it through third cuts, as did two of my friends.  I remember the teacher calling me in and saying Alice, I know you made third cuts, and this was a big deal to get that far.  That was final cuts.  She said I know that you made third cuts, but we're having a family play this year, so I know you'll understand that you can't be in it.  I went home and I told my mother [Mary Roena Ward Roberts].  Remember, I told you my mother graduated in theater arts from [University of] Denver.  The next day I'm in class and I get a note to come down to the principal's office and there's my mother sitting in the principal's office with her legs crossed and a shopping bag sitting next to her and she's very business-like.  She said Alice, please come and sit down, I wanted you to be in on this discussion I'm having with the principal.  I can't remember his name for the life of me.  He was a Quaker, a very good man.  She said I want you to understand that I graduated from Denver University in theater arts, and I'm very familiar with theater and I have a bag of French plays here and I'm quite sure that the director can find an appropriate play in this bag and if not, I have others at home.  Do we understand each other?  (laughs)  So anyway, I got in the senior play as did the other two girls, and the teacher made sure I only had one line, but hey, sometimes that's the price of being the one who fights the battle.
Speaker 2: That's what I wanted to also ask you.  What I found interesting is that a lot of times the education in the North was totally different from people who got educated in the South.  How was that different from--Were you aware that being--Was there any difference to you?
Speaker 1: Yes, there was.  I always call Indianapolis up South, because as far as I'm concerned, our upbringing and the schooling and so forth was just as it was in the South, it was completely segregated.  When we moved from my grandmother's [Zella Louise Locklear Ward] house into the house that my father [Erskine Goode Roberts] bought on the block that I described on which I grew up, we were not allowed to go to the grammar school that was for blacks, it was still segregated.  I laugh when people carry on about busing.  I mean people who are anti-busing.  Can you imagine all of a ten square block area of black children every morning, rain, shine, snow, sleet, stood on street corners and waited for buses to pick us up and take us back to George Washington Carver Elementary School which was on the other side of town and it wasn't until my brother [Erskine Ward Roberts] came along and was ready for school that he could go to that elementary school.  So yes, I did see a difference.  It was an interesting time in a sense that we weren't wanted there in one sense and so clubs and organizations and so forth, you could try to join and some of them opened and some of them didn't.  On the other hand, we received a superb education.  I still have some of the textbooks and I just bemoan the fact that so many young people don't have that kind of education.  In high school I had world literature and was reading Persian poetry as a freshman and Turkish poetry and essays from English writers.  That was what was expected of us and so we wrote and read and did throughout the entire four years.  Of course, you had battles, but who doesn't.  I wouldn't trade it regardless.  I wouldn't trade any of those experiences.
Story_ID: 11540
Speaker 1: I graduated and was off to college, the entire block came to see me off.
Speaker 2: Where did you go?
Speaker 1: Indiana [University], Bloomington [Indiana].
Speaker 2: Was there anything significant about your college experience and the things you learned during that time?  You graduated when?
Speaker 1: I stepped out.  Life was very interesting.  No, I did not go all the way through.  I went to Indiana University and I think I wasn't ready to go to college yet.  I graduated from high school at 16 and I turned 17 before the fall, but I wasn't ready for the social life.  I wasn't a social person in that regard, but just a huge campus and all the rest of this, I wasn't ready for.  I ended up coming back to Chicago and went to Roosevelt [University] for a while and married and by the time I went back to school, I finished living in a trailer with a two year old and doing my papers in the tub in the trailer which was probably not much larger than this seat.  I'd have to see him to bed and asleep before I could do my work, took him to the babysitter on a Schwinn bike, because that's all I had.  I had no radio, no television, had a transistor radio and I could afford a battery about once a month, so if it ran out before then, that was it.  I learned a lot, matured and never looked back after that.
Speaker 2: Was there any thought that you were going to go to Tuskegee [Institute]?
Speaker 1: No, I can't say.  I remember all my grandparents had died by this time and so forth.
Speaker 2: Do you think your life is--They were old though.  You said your grandfather [Joseph Henry Ward] was about 90 when he died.
Speaker 1: And apparently my grandmother [Zella Louise Locklear Ward] was in her 80's [1980s], but you'd never know it, because she never let a gray hair touch her head (laughs).
Story_ID: 11541
Speaker 1: My father [Erskine Goode Roberts] had moved to Chicago and was living in the Rosenwald [Homes] and in fact, across the hall from Vivian Harsh.  They knew her very well.  I only knew her in passing.  My father and mother [Mary Roena Ward Roberts] divorced and my father remarried, so this was his second marriage when he moved to Chicago.
Speaker 2: What were your thoughts about Chicago when you first came here?
Speaker 1: I loved it.  In fact, I had a play cousin who was the nephew of my stepmother, who was also in college somewhere in Kansas or whatever, and we would meet up in Chicago and he would meet me--the train came from Bloomington, Indiana to Chicago to 63rd Street I think.  He would meet me and I'd have my little bag and we would go to all the jazz clubs we could find before we got home and said hello to our family.
Speaker 2: So you were here.  You're here.  You got married.  You met Gary Edwards, who you're married to now?
Speaker 1: No.  I married Ben Robinson at Roosevelt [University].  Both of us were students and when he finished Roosevelt and then I went back to Indiana to finish and we were the ones living in the trailer.
Speaker 2: What were those early years like?  You learned a lot then.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Early years where?
Speaker 2: When you were married.  Early years of marriage and handling a child and going to school.
Speaker 1: Amazing.  I couldn't cook.  I didn't know about children.  I knew nothing, but I taught myself and turned out to be a very good cook and I hope a decent mother.  My son says so.
Speaker 2: This is where I need a little help.  After you graduate from Roosevelt?
Speaker 1: No, Indiana.
Speaker 2: But you said you attended both of them.
Speaker 1: Yes.  I came to Chicago right after.  I had been to Indiana for maybe a year, year and a half and then my father had moved to Chicago by then.  I came to live with them and I went to Roosevelt during that time.  That's where I got married and we set up housekeeping.  I was an at-home mom, but I had all kinds of interesting jobs on the side to keep food on the table, but when I decided it was time to go back to school, I thought my best investment was at Indiana University and I went back there to finish.  I went back to Indianapolis first and lived with my mother and worked three and four jobs to put myself through and then got enough of a scholarship to go back full time to Bloomington, but it didn't pay for more than living and I think $30 a month trailer.
Speaker 2: Then you graduated in what year?
Speaker 1: I think it was December of 1965, but we would really call it 1966, because they didn't acknowledge until June.  There were only June graduations.  You might finish, but it was only a June graduation.  So 1966.
Speaker 2: Then did you take some time off, because you got your masters--
Speaker 1: Later.  Much, much later.
Speaker 2: So you came back here to live?
Speaker 1: No.  Went to Indianapolis, in Bloomington.  Taught school immediately.  A job immediately teaching junior high school English on the top floor of the high school that I had attended.  The board was not happy about having--the school was not happy about having the junior high located there, so it was a rough experience, first teaching job.  I shared--what they had done was to divide a study hall down the middle.  I don't mean length-wise, cross-wise with some rusty lockers from the boy's locker room and one side of that was the science teacher and I was on the other side.  There was only one plug in the room on my side, so because she had difficulty keeping discipline, she showed movies a lot, so she put the cord over the top of my head, my children's heads, plugged it in and I learned to teach English in the dark. Love [Edgar Allan] Poe.  You would be surprised what you can do with 'The Raven' in the dark if you try to teach English and people can't see.  I learned and it was great (laughs).

Speaker 1: Chicago's been very good to me in the sense of maturing me as a political person, as an activist.  When I came back here, I went to work at Malcolm X College and that of course, you can imagine in the 1960s was quite an experience.  The [Black] Panthers headquarters were there.  Extraordinary people I met.  The whole burgeoning of black history and sensibility and culture and so forth.  I went to school, masters, UIC [University of Illinois-Chicago], headed up English component there and co-authored a couple of books.  Each move was not anything that I sat down and planned.  I would be asked to do certain things so it's been very good.  The movement through to various things from Malcolm X to Northwestern [University].  I went out there to work on my PhD and to help myself through.  By this time I was pregnant with my daughter.  [Edward L.] Buzz [Palmer] and I had married by then and so I was full time in PhD, co-authoring two books and giving birth to my daughter, and also tutoring in the Black House and then when the head of the Black House left, he recommended me to take his place.  By this time I was a year away from my PhD and I became associate dean of students and dean of African American studies, student affairs.  I got the opportunity after I had been there about five years, got a call from a national citizen action organization, an activist organization, would I come and head up their voter registration education and so that was fabulous.  It allowed me to come back and get active in Chicago around the time that Harold Washington came into office.  In between time, after that, I was invited to put together a metropolitan YMCA [Young Men's Christian Association] youth and government program.  There's always been one for the state and in looking at it, there's only one high school in Chicago participated but it was rewarding under John Casey, who was president of the Metro Y then, who was the wind at my back in that.  My husband had had a conversation earlier about what had shaped them as committed civic minded people and both of them said it was this kind of youth, Boys Town, that kind of thing.  I guess if I have any pride, that's one of them that that is still going on.  It's been 12 or 13 years now and it's still going on.  It was from there that I went into the [Illinois state] senate, got the call and so forth and went to the senate.
Story_ID: 11543
Speaker 1: Based on your story that you really had to really hit the ground.  I also know that you had had all this experience in university, but this is big politics and really not that much is known about the Illinois General Assembly.
Speaker 2: You're right unfortunately.
Speaker 1: I'd like you to share some of your--the things you learned there at the beginning.  You had been involved in what committees?
Speaker 2: Almost all of them.  When I left, I was the Democratic spokesman for the Revenue Committee.  I was before that, the Democratic spokesman for Commerce and Industry committee.  I served on Education committee.  When I first got there, there was a higher education and an elementary.  I served on both of those.  After the Senate changed in 1992, I served on the Education committee, Appointments committee, Appropriations for a short time.
Speaker 1: You may have probably had some impressions of what it would be like and I'm wondering what your impressions of what it was, or you thought it might be different from what it was?
Speaker 2: I had had some experience, because my husband [Edward L. "Buzz" Palmer] and [Illinois] senator [Richard H.] Newhouse and Senator [Harold] Washington and that whole group were friends, and so I had been to Springfield often to visit Dick Newhouse and other black senators.  I was usually there while my husband went and did business.  I would go to the library or something else.  So I knew what it looked like and I knew who these people were, but I had not been actively engaged in anything that had to do with Springfield, so this was a first in that regard.
Speaker 1: Was your husband surprised when you were chosen?
Speaker 2: I don't think he was.
Speaker 1: You had been a ward committeeman?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Which tickled me, a ward committeeman.
Speaker 1: So you had obviously been active in your community?
Speaker 2: Oh absolutely.
Speaker 1: Then what are your views about politics and African Americans there and why do you choose to be involved?  I mean you could have stayed as an academic.
Speaker 2: I said before what my slogan was about "Power concedes nothing without a struggle," and there's more to that about plowing up the earth, the power of the sea and so forth and all that goes into that.  Another slogan is, "Those who don't do politics will have politics done to them."  So in that regard, politics--there is a politics of everything if you stop to think about it.  There is a politics, there is an economy of everything.  When I hear people say I don't like politics.  There's a politics of going to the grocery store, there's a politics of sending your child to school.  So to deny that we need to be engaged in that section of politics that is elected and appointed and in charge of the decisions that affect all of our lives is to be extremely foolish, and certainly we are not a foolish people.  What did I learn?  I learned that that is true, what I just talked about.  I learned that it is very humbling to be part of an institution where you are making, every decision that you make affects the lives of people, not just in your constituency, but across the board and as we become more and more aware of the--It's always been--we've always been globalized, we just haven't paid as close attention.  As we become more aware of that, that saying we had in the '60s [1960s], everything is everything, becomes so evident and that--It's a very powerful experience and it's one where you better keep your feet solidly on the floor and the protocols of course, are very pleasant to be called Senator, to be--The respect is built into the protocols, but I would imagine it's like being some kind of a way the people in the theater must be, you better keep your feet on the ground, because here today, gone tomorrow.  Make the most of it, because you are working for the people.  I was so pleased when I got down there.  I was taken under the wing of the senior Democratic senator and the senior Republican woman senator, both of them women, who tutored me, because as I said, this was the longest session, I don't know in the history, but certainly extremely long.  We did not finish until around July 15.  So to be there that entire time and the intensity of the session--one of the women took me aside and said, "Now Alice, by the time we get to the last day of sessions, you are going to have a stack of bills in front of you that when you stand at your desk, you will not be able to see over them and they will be on your desk for final voting, so let me suggest to you a way that you can look at these bills quickly, because you got here after many of the committees have met, so you haven't been here when the discussion was going on about them."  The Republican woman--the two of them insisted that all the women senators, both sides of the aisle, have dinner together at least once a month or every two months, and that was a very powerful thing.  That was what I went down there under and I'm so grateful that I had--although it was just from June to November when I did run for election and was elected, but I'm glad I had that period of time, because so many who have been elected since then when the Senate changed hands, did not have that experience of serving under a president who was bipartisan-minded and of members who were bipartisan minded.  Some of the best legislation as far as I'm concerned, came out of that.  Of course, afterwards things changed.  We were all pleased that we could get Senator [Emil] Jones in as the Democratic leader, if that makes a difference, especially when things changed so drastically and dramatically and all kinds of non-progressive legislation started to come out.
Speaker 1: Was it the whole--
Speaker 2: See, the leader of either House has extraordinary powers and the combination of the leader of the Senate and the House have inordinate powers.  It all has to be negotiated, the relationships.  There is no--see, we're not used to that in Chicago, because we have a kind of one-party town.  You may have shades of left or right on it, but in essence it is a one-party town, and the [city] council operates as people from one party.  They don't agree on many things, but in the end when it comes time for presidential elections or governorship elections or whatever, you can see that it's a Democratic town.  When you go to Springfield, you are serving with people who come from all over the state who have very different notions, have a very different worldview from yours coming from the city of Chicago, whatever part of the city you represent.  So I took that very seriously that in addition to serving my constituency and that's extremely important to have a good service office and people.  My administrative assistant--I was blessed in the people who worked with me.  I told you how I got there, that momentary thing.  After a while, the dean of black secretaries came up and said, "I'd like to be your secretary."  I didn't even know her at the time.  I said, "I'm going up to get my seat and my assignment and all this."  She said, "Don't worry about it," and was just extraordinary. And then in Chicago, Constance Goosby, she told me that it's--she said, "Now, when I answer the phone, the way I answer it tells people on the other end of the line what kind of office this is."  She was always a person who was very generous and joyous and took care of much business between the two of them.  I had a very small staff.
Story_ID: 11544
Speaker 1: Were you conscious of being a female more down there or were you conscious of being an African American?
Speaker 2: Both.  More an African American, but I have to say that at the time I got there, a wonderful woman, who was when the Democrats were in the majority in the Senate, the first woman was elected to be elected by the Democratic leadership to be the clerk.  That's probably not the correct name, of the Senate.  She had me laughing.  She said when she came in this position, she took the president by the hand and at the back of the chamber, she took him back there and she said now, this is the men's room and she took him to the other side and she said there's no women's room here, so do you understand that when women have to go to the bathroom who are senators, they have to go out of the chambers, down to the first floor and back again.  Doesn't it make sense that we should have a bathroom for women?  So it made a difference, yes.  She of course, was one who went to dinner with us as well.  There's some extraordinary people on the staff.  People don't pay attention to that.  It's the same thing dealing with Congress.  Once you find out who the staff members are, because they are the front line of people who are informed and engaged and people one should know.
Story_ID: 11545
Speaker 1: As it relates to African Americans--the focus is on African Americans and the Illinois General Assembly.  So what would you consider sort of--we're trying to find out what the themes are.  Maybe there were some prevailing things.  What is that body of--and what are the issues that this group is sort of asking?
Speaker 2: I think it would be the same thing you would find anywhere.  If you find yourself in a position of being able, if not to have power, at least to have influence.  It's kind of a duality, on the one hand to try to protect your people from the worst of policies that could be made.  For example, when some of the welfare reform stuff came out.  I'll give you a good example.  The SSI [Supplemental Security Income], the disability laws--When this whole welfare reform movement started after 1992, there was a kind of attitude among too many people from other constituencies, let's just sweep everybody out of receiving any kind of public money, and I remember working with--her name escapes me right now, but one of the black women senators.  To say there are African American men who are on SSI who cannot get jobs.  They are veterans, they are people with disability, they are people who are not going to work, so let us at least amend this.  We couldn't save it all, but we could at least amend it to say--to put in that this category of men will not be excluded from SSI, and quite often that's what you can do when there's a tidal wave that has come down and is sweeping away much of what we fought so hard for.  In some instances what you can do is to try to reclaim some of this, but the other part is to fight straight up, just to say no and put together whatever it is you can to fight for something proactively rather than reactively.  I think that black legislators serve in both of those and just as the civil rights movement was the engine and so many other movements came in its tail wind, I think often black legislators do that as well.  They proactively put forward something and then that serves as an engine for others.
Story_ID: 11546
Speaker 1: Who do you think was the most important African American that served in the Illinois General Assembly?
Speaker 2: I don't think you can identify one person.  I think that that has to do with when they served, what they did.  For example, I've always been impressed by what a group of legislators--Harold Washington was certainly part of that, called the 'Crazy Eight'.  That's a perfect example of what I'm talking about.  Dawn Clark Netsch, Harold Washington, a group of senators, black and white, and others.  There were those in the House as well who decided to be independent and to put forward proactively from their progressive legislation and to fight for it.  I admire that tremendously.  I knew that when I got down there and that was kind of an ideal for me and it certainly--I understood that I needed to learn.  It was a craft I needed to learn.  It was a power and so forth, and so I spent a lot of time in small towns, in Decatur, Illinois at a meeting set up by--let me back up a second.  When I got down there, [Illinois state] senator Babe Woodyard, a Republican, came across the aisle to greet me and he said you know [Illinois state] senator [Richard H.] Newhouse and I have formed an exchange program between upstate and downstate legislators, do you want to continue that.  I said absolutely.  So among other things, he set up a meeting.  [Illinois state] Senator [Emil] Jones was there.  Superintendents from about 15 schools met in Decatur many years ago and we compared notes about urban education.  Because I'd been with cities and schools and because I'd been active in the ed equity coalition [National Coalition for Equity in Education] before I went in to get adequate and equitable school funding, when I got in the legislature I set up a forum.  I don't think I'd been in but a few months.  I set up a forum at the Urban League and brought in Republican and Democratic people to speak on the issue of school funding.  Even the paper that I put out from my district office, my first or second edition, I had senator Jones speak to it and I had a Republican speak to the question of school funding, because I wanted my constituents to hear the debate.  I wanted them to know what the issues were.  I spent a lot of time on farms.  I have pictures of me, I went to visit--because I wanted to know, I wanted to understand.  The University of Illinois has an extension service.  Once they found out I was interested, I was invited to a lot of things outside of Chicago or Springfield.
Speaker 1: Was there anything that happened in that time period that you were most proud that you were a part of?
Speaker 2: One of the things that I was most proud of--when I first got down there, there was a House structure and a Senate structure in terms of the black coalition kind of thing.  I don't mean coalition, I mean [Congressional] Black Caucus kind of thing.  We decided, because a lot of new people came in and so forth.  We had a big meeting after the 1992 election at the State of Illinois building.  We just shut the door and sat down and decided that we were going to pull this together and make it a much tighter group in terms of being a caucus and we accomplished that.  That allowed us then over the next many years and on to now, to speak as one voice, which is extremely important, because then that allows you to be seen as a bloc, a voting bloc, to be seen as--to be taken seriously and not to fight over who's the leader of the caucus, to set up a mechanism by which the leadership is elected, and successors are elected after that.  I think that was--that then operated on many bills and many issues.  I think that was important.
Story_ID: 11547
Speaker 1: I'd like to start out by asking you who do you think you have admired the most or--
Speaker 2: There's so many, it's hard to say.  The women who were Freedom Riders, the black women of the early 20th century.  I mentioned the book the two women and the American Expeditionary Forces.  Extraordinary women who decided to go to war with their men and knowing that so many of the black soldiers couldn't read, they made the Y[MCA, Young Men's Christian Association] send them and they taught them to read and to write.  Women like that, I think are just phenomenal.  Winnie Mandela, Nelson Mandela, that whole--all of the women who said during the movement, you have struck a rock.  I don't know if I mentioned, I was co-chair of the Free South Africa Movement in Chicago, and so I got to meet a lot of South African women.  That whole group and so forth, and all women in this country.  The list is endless of black women in this country who have just made a difference for everybody.  That's why I think this project is exciting because it's time to unearth these people.  We have gotten, I think, unfortunately, too satisfied with the hero, conventional people and with all due respect, but a friend of mine who at 15, was one of the field directors for SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee] in Chicago and who to this day said she will not fry another chicken, because she had to fry too many of them in too many church basements over that time.  When I think about people like her and that's a powerful group.  Yet, we talk about the uppers without--It was the folks on the bottom who had to lift all that up.
Story_ID: 11548
Speaker 1: In terms of the African American community, what are your concerns about its survival now or what are the issues that you think you see?
Speaker 2: There are lots of them, but the one that my husband [Edward L. "Buzz" Palmer] I have been concentrating on for some time, and it's an outgrowth of earlier work--We have put together something called a Black Institute years ago when Kernie [L.] Anderson was here with WBMX [FM], who used to have a radio program, Issues and Newsmakers, and we would make it a point--I remember with the early movement, we would have brunch on Sunday mornings once a month at Catfish Digby's and have a panel and we had early ANC [African National Congress] people, so people could come and have waffles and chicken and sit down and listen to a discussion on anti-apartheid in person.  Then we moved it and so forth.  So the issue of internationalism and black people have been very central.  It's extremely important now that we pay attention, not just pay attention, but actually engage in it.  An outgrowth of the Black Institute, we've put together what we call the People Program.  It started out when I was in the legislature to be an exchange of legislators, I was the chair for a year of the international committee of the National Black Caucus of State Legislators and through the People Program the goal here is, our point here is, the Civil Rights Movement, other movements created a layer of black leadership of black people who are knowledgeable across the board and that's true in Europe and in Africa.
Story_ID: 11549
Speaker 1: It's actually part and parcel of what we were talking about already.  The movements over all the centuries that we have been here as black people and before the fight back and so forth, have created layers of black people who have been knowledgeable, active and so forth.  I was saying that now with globalization being on the front burner, that it is even more important for African Americans to be engaged in this.  If we do not define ourselves and our futures now, then we will spend the 21st century having to react to what has been defined for us and this time around we're not coming out of this as slaves, we are coming out of this as informed people.  That is what the People Program does.  It brings together this layer of leadership in the United States, in Europe.  It's fascinating how many black leaders there are.  We've had exchange programs that we brought people here from Europe and Africa and we've put them together.  Now, for example, one of the projects that we have is what we call "the social spot" and that is to be an international kind of a moveable feast, look at the welfare state on three continents.  To answer the other question, what would I fear about the future is the drop off in terms of the generations.  I want that intergenerational strength.  It's no different from politics.  Critical mass helps you get things passed, helps you get people elected, helps you influence things.  If we have a drop off of young people--I think we spend too much time saying it's the at-risk youth.  It's all of them.  I find highly educated, bright young black people--a colleague of mine the other day was at one of the charter schools and this is supposed to be the cream of the crop, talking to some of the black faculty and he's reading Margaret Walker's book on Richard Wright, and he mentioned it and they didn't know who Richard Wright was.  These are 30-something year olds.  That's scary.  That's really scary.  We've got some work to do to reconnect the generations and to do it aggressively, because there's a kind of attitude, I think that this isn't necessary or when people talk about children are our future, yes they are, but we are the present and in order for them to have a decent future, we'd better hook up those two parts, because to be a future, but to be floating out there by yourself is not much of a future.
Story_ID: 11550
Speaker 1: I want to ask you what you want to be remembered for?
Speaker 2: That I was committed, strong, a lifelong learner and loved the people.
