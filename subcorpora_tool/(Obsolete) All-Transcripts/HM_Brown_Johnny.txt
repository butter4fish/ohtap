Story_ID: 68263
Speaker 1: And tell me about your parents.
Speaker 2: Well, my--
Speaker 1: First your mother.
Speaker 2: My mom--
Speaker 1: Her full name.
Speaker 2: Her full name is Josephine.  Her maiden name is Mullen.
Speaker 1: Spell it for us.
Speaker 2: That's M-U-L-L-E-N.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Okay.  She was, well, she was born also in Gallion, Alabama.  Her father's name was Mack Mullen.  And she came from a family of sixteen brothers and sisters.  Yeah, yeah.  And--
Speaker 1: Do you know when she was born?
Speaker 2: She was born in 1918.
Speaker 1: Is she still living?
Speaker 2: She's still living.  Unfortunately, she lives in Atlanta, Georgia now.  Unfortunately she is an Alzheimer's victim.  But she has, she has been, had that illness for about eleven years now.  Physically, she's in good condition, but you know how that situation is, yeah.
Speaker 1: And your mother's parents, do you know their names and where they're from?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  They're, my mother's dad who, as I said, Mack Mullen, he's from the same area; and her mother is from the same area.  He was one of the fortunate blacks at that time.  He worked as a sharecropper.  And later on the owner of that property sold it to him, and he became one of the early plantation owners.  Where... if you're familiar with the plantation settings, where you have the big house and all the little small houses around--well, he had his sons and his daughters, they lived in those small homes and he had the big house.
Speaker 1: Oh, wow, that's great.  Do you know about what period that was?
Speaker 2: This was, this was in the twenties [1920s] and thirties [1930s], yeah.
Speaker 1: That was quite an accomplishment.
Speaker 2: It was quite an establishment, yeah.
Story_ID: 68264
Speaker 1: And your dad?
Speaker 2: My father was, he basically, he was born in Alabama in around that same area, but an area called Dayton, Alabama which was approximately, oh I'd say about fifteen to twenty miles away from where my mom was born and reared.  Although at that time, they, you have to remember, it seemed like it might have been five hundred miles away.  That's because there were no automobiles--well, they didn't own any automobiles.  They traveled then by horse and wagon.  So, it seems like it was an astronomical distance, when although it was only about fifteen miles away from each other.
Speaker 1: So, your grandparents on your dad's side and your grandparents on your mom's side, they were all from the same--
Speaker 2: They were all from basically the same area, yes.
Story_ID: 68265
Speaker 1: We're going to come back to your grandparents in a minute.  But let me ask you some fun questions, what we call our "People" Magazine questions.
Speaker 2: Okay.  (Laughter).
Speaker 1: What is your favorite color?
Speaker 2: Brown, like my name.  (Laughter).
Speaker 1: And your favorite food?
Speaker 2: Preferably fish and chicken, yeah.
Speaker 1: And your favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Well, in the United States, California, preferably San Francisco.  I like the area around San Francisco, San Diego, San Jose, northern California, if you you're talking in terms of the United States.  Out of the country, probably Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, yeah.
Speaker 1: Great locations, plus you can get a lot of fish in San Francisco.
Speaker 2: Exactly. (Laughter).
Speaker 1: Puerto Vallarta's alright.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.   What is your favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: My favorite phrase or saying?  (Laughter).  "Love yourself as much as you love your country."
Speaker 1: Oh, that's a good one.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And you try to do that, I guess?
Speaker 2: I try to do that, because I think your self-esteem is very, very important.  And if you, if you miss the boat on that, then you can't very well say you love your country.  And that's why I put it in that order, yeah.
Story_ID: 68266
Speaker 1: Okay, And so, let us travel back in time now.  And give me an idea of your relationship with your grandparents first, your mother's--
Speaker 2: My mother's parents?  Well, my mother [Josephine Mullen-Brown], I speak more of my mother's father [Mack Mullen] than I do my mother's mother, simply because my mother's father, he was married about four times, you know.  But the wives were deceased, and it wasn't that...  My mother's mother was his first wife.  And her father was a--I think that's where I got my basic concept of entrepreneurship.  Because he ran his organization just like you would a business.  He was the type of individual that took his children and his children's children, which is his grandchildren, and they, he had... you know, they picked cotton, they farmed the land, they brought the harvest in.  He didn't have really any outside people other than the family.  Like I said, he had sixteen sons and daughters.  And they, my mother, had twelve children.  Her brothers, some of her brothers had as many as fourteen and fifteen children.  So, he utilized that concept and he taught us the meaning, the true meaning of entrepreneurship, yeah.
Speaker 1: And you're named after that grandfather?
Speaker 2: Yes.  My middle name is after that grandfather.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And your first name is after... your first name, is it after--
Speaker 2: No.  My first name is Johnny.  But his name was just Mack Mullen.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.  And my parents took his middle name and gave it to me.
Speaker 1: Your mother--how many kids did your father have with your mother?
Speaker 2: Sixteen.
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: They were all--
Speaker 1: I mean your grandparents, I'm sorry, your grandparents.  How many of your mother's siblings--
Speaker 2: Six.  There was six that was around that was my mother's... full... you know, by Mack Mullen, yes.
Story_ID: 68267
Speaker 1: So you got really your entrepreneurial spirit from your grandfather [Mack Mullen]?
Speaker 2: The first taste of it, yes.  And then the main taste came from my father [Abe Brown].  He was not as fortunate as my mom [Josephine Mullen-Brown].  When I say fortunate, they were able to work for each other as opposed to working, as opposed to sharecropping for the white Americans.  My dad, his family sharecropped, okay.  And he never liked the concept of sharecropping.  Because I didn't fully understand it at the time, but I do now.  And the primary reason he didn't, he could not relate to the system, is because you would work all year, then you would borrow money against what your expectations of what the crop would bring.  By the time that you had a bad year, or if you had a good year...  Let's say you had a good year.  When you harvested and took the harvest and traded that off for the dollars and cents, you were still short.  So, you were always playing the catch-up game, and he never liked that.
Story_ID: 68268
Speaker 1: Did your father [Abe Brown] sharecrop all of your growing up years?  How long did he--
Speaker 2: Well, he actually sharecropped the majority of...  Well, I'm the seventh child, okay.  And a year after I was born, he moved, he and my mom [Josephine Mullen-Brown] moved to a town called Demopolis [Alabama], which was in a different county.  We were, Gallion [Alabama] was in Hale County, same county as [HM Eugene] Gene Sawyer and that group was from, you know.  So, these are people that I knew.  And he moved to a town called Demopolis which was in a county called Marengo County, which is the same town that [Ralph] Abernathy is from, you know, with Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.].  So we grew up with the Abernathys and that group.  And in that town they had a, they had what they call a cement plant, Lone Star Cement Plant.  And my dad, prior to him moving to Demopolis, he was able to secure a job there.  And keep in mind that Demopolis was roughly about eighteen miles away from where my parents lived at that time.  So, he walked; he was working the eleven to seven shift.  He walked those miles every day.
Speaker 1: How many miles?
Speaker 2: Eighteen miles.
Speaker 1: Round trip?
Speaker 2: Round trip.  Well, eighteen miles one way.
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  He would walk from Hale County to Demopolis, work, get off the following morning, and then walk back; and this is a serious thing.  He walked; he and my uncle.  Later on, they purchased a Ford, a car together, okay.  Because these two brothers were very, very close.  And they purchased a car, and a year later they moved to Demopolis, okay, because neither of them liked the sharecropping concept.  And actually my uncle had gone to Tuskegee [University in Alabama], and he was actually a brick mason.  And that's what he did at the cement plant, whereas my father basically was more or less a laborer.  But he was very, very instrumental in teaching us to take care of yourself, you know, in terms of becoming an entrepreneur.
Speaker 1: Give me an illustration of, on the entrepreneurial side, an experience you remember that really stands out for you, where you saw your father use his entrepreneurial spirit and heritage.
Speaker 2: Well, the thing that's outstanding to me about my dad, even though he was considered a laborer--but he worked, he chose to work a night shift, because racial prejudice was so bad, he did not want...  See, if you keep in mind when they worked--when you worked three shifts, like a day--like from seven to three; three to eleven; eleven to seven--it's a normal procedure that you have less bosses on a midnight shift.  You know, you might have one guy, that's okay.  So, there was a sense of freedom that he felt, you know, by working this shift.  And during the day, with sixteen--I mean twelve children--during the day he would work as a carpenter, okay.  And his off days he would work as a carpenter to supplement that income in terms of taking care of his children.  And where the entrepreneurship came in, everybody at that time were going to the fields and picking cotton for, you know, the rich plantation owners, even myself.  You know, I got caught at the very end of it.  And what happened was, he says, "Look, if you all want... I can only give you what I can afford to give you, and that's not much.  You know, I can give you change in clothes and that sort of thing, but it's very limited.  So, if you don't want to go to the fields--and I don't want you to go to the fields."  And he told his daughters, "I refuse to let you work in somebody's house.  Because that system, what happens in that system, the next thing you know you're pregnant by a person that's there.  And I'm not going to permit my wife to work in that situation, and I'm not going to permit my two daughters to work under those circumstances.  And I would prefer my sons getting a job downtown, you know, working in some shoe store or something of that nature as opposed to going to the fields."  And we didn't understand why he felt that way.  It's because this way you can learn what it means to run a business.  But you cannot get that, you cannot learn that concept from the fields.  You can learn to be a plantation owner, which those circumstances are almost null and void.  So, this is the thing that made me remember my father more than anything else.
Story_ID: 68269
Speaker 1: How old were you when your father [Abe Brown] died?  Is he still living?
Speaker 2: No, my father died, he was 51 when he died.  I had just graduated from high school, yeah.  He died in 19--I graduated from high school in '61' [1961], and he died in '61' [1961] [sic, 1962].
Speaker 1: And your mom, before she took ill she was able to see you successful?  I mean realize--
Speaker 2: Well, my mom [Josephine Mullen-Brown] was... at the time that my father died, she reared five children alone.  Because like I said, I had just graduated from high school, and my dad had told me then that...  I had three brothers that was in college at the same time.  Which... because his concept was then... you know, southerners would say, "Well, you got to go to school, you got to go to college."  And then even though with twelve children he said, "You must, you have to go to college."  So, we got caught up in a situation where two or three was in college at the same time.  And if you remember back in those years, in '55' [1955], '54' [1954]... '55' [1955], '56' [1956], those years there weren't any scholarships available for minority children, okay.  It was all, you had to pay your way.  You know, all you could... maybe if you went to, if you chose to go to some of the black colleges, then you might have an opportunity to get to work your way through.  I had one brother at that time that was on what you call a five year plan.  It took him five years to do a four year deal, because he was working.  I had another brother that chose to go to Kent State [University in Ohio] back then in 1955.  And you know, that school... and then you had out-of-state fees that was unbelievable.  I don't know why he chose to do that.  And you also had, you know, tuition and room and board and that sort of thing, which was unbelievable.  And then I had... my other sister at that time was at Talladega [College in Alabama].  So, we, when my turn came, my father says, "Well, look, I cannot afford to send you to college.  The only thing I can do is... I have a sister that lives in Chicago [Illinois].  Maybe you want to go to Chicago and work your way through school."  And this is, this is what happened.  So, getting back to my mom, she was there with five children.  And her concept at that time was that, "I'm not going to re-marry, even though I need to."  Because she was not old enough to get Social Security, okay.  She wasn't old enough to get those benefits.  So, what we did was, we had a meeting.  We called a meeting back in Demopolis [Alabama], and we met there one Christmas.  And the seven of us that had graduated from high school, some from college--the meeting was about the five that was left, and what we were going to do with our mother.  And we, we chose to get together, pool our little money that we did have, make sure that the five went to college, and make sure our mother didn't have to work.  And that has gone on right up until this day.
Story_ID: 68270
Speaker 1: Do you have any special stories or illustrations of your direct relationship to your mother [Josephine Mullen-Brown]?
Speaker 2: Yes.  My mom was very much into her children, like most mothers are.  When... she had a brother that lives I a place called Tuscaloosa [Alabama], you know, where the University of Alabama is.  At the time that Autherine Lucy was trying to get in, and George Wallace says "never," well, she got in.  And my mom's brother lived there, and he was married; but they couldn't have children.  And you know, in the South, that was a thing that you... you had children.  They weren't fortunate enough to have children.  His wife was a nurse.  And they asked my mother could they have one of her children.  And she decided that I would be that person, you know.  Because I, I think primarily because I was having some difficulties with the principal at the school.  And then... not that you were...  In those days when they considered you bad... you were not bad, you know what I'm saying?  You just, you might talk back or something like that, but you didn't hit anybody or hurt anybody or use profanity.  That was a no-no.  That was just our--you didn't smoke any cigarettes, you didn't drink, you know.  Because I remember back then, I had my first beer when I graduated from high school.  Because that was one of those things you just didn't do.  You wasn't around them, and you just didn't do it.  But she chose to, she says, she asked me, she sat me down and says, "Look, my brother, they want a child.  And they'd prefer a son.  Would you mind going to live with them?"  And, you know, when you're accustomed to being around twelve other brothers and sisters, I mean... and all of a sudden now you're an only child... I thought about it a little bit.  She said, "Well, you're going to have to let me know before school starts."  This was something like August.  So, I decided to go live with my uncle.  And that was the third phase of entrepreneurship.  He worked at a place called... in Holt, Alabama, which was right outside of Tuscaloosa, where they made concrete blocks and bricks and that sort of thing.  But his side thing was bootlegging, okay.  (Laughter).  So, he lived a very good life.  I mean, he had funds.  He taught me how to--when they would go on vacation, he taught me how to run his business while they were gone. (Laughter).  And I couldn't have been any more than twelve or thirteen years old.  (Laughter).  But, and I used to, you know, write back and tell my mother about it.  And she thought it was crazy, but I, you know, I felt like it was a difference... another step in my life to let me know what life was all about.  He was a very good person.  His name by the way, he was named after his grandfather.  His name was Mack Mullen.  And his wife was a very good person.  And about two years later, she died.  Yeah, she died of cancer.  And he re-married about three years later.  And at that time I chose to go back, you know.  Because I kind of felt like at that--you know, they had children of their own then; they were having children.  And I kind of felt like I wasn't needed there anymore, so I went back, I went back home.
Speaker 1: You were out of high school when you went back home?
Speaker 2: No, I went back... I was a junior in high school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: When I went back, yeah.
Speaker 1: And what did it feel like, being without your sisters and brothers?
Speaker 2: It was, it was a strange feeling.  I mean it was a--to be honest with you, I never was completely happy.  You know, because I was just too accustomed to being around family.  And my uncle did everything in the world for me.  I appreciate it to the max.  But it's just that something was missing.  I just couldn't get accustomed...  I was, we lived a different life.  We were so-called bourgeois in Tuscaloosa, and in Alabama we were just poor people.  But, you know, I chose the poor world because of family.
Speaker 1: So, you spent about five years in Tuscaloosa?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Give or take a few.
Speaker 2: Right.
Story_ID: 68271
Speaker 1: So, when you went back [to his family in Demopolis, Alabama] and you were a junior [in high school], what was happening with you school-wise?  How did it feel to be back in the family, the closer family mix?
Speaker 2: It felt good.  The reception that I got at the school was basically pretty much the same when I left.  If you remember in the resume, the nickname was "Jap."  And the reason that I was called "Jap" was because you remember when they bombed Pearl Harbor?  And my father [Abe Brown] said I was such an evil child until they started calling me "Jap."  So, when the opportunity came (Laughter) for someone to go with my uncle, they naturally pointed the finger at me.  But when I got back home, you know, the family just loved it.  But you know, your peer groups...  I had a gang, they called it the "Jap Gang."  But gangs at that time weren't gangs like they are now.  They didn't gangbang, and we didn't shoot anybody.  We just played, we went out and we played.  We made little treehouses, and that kind of thing.  So when I got back, I was challenged for that position again.  So it was, it was, it was fun.  And I appreciated my peer group, because they took me through little changes at first.  Because, you know, it was like the outsider coming back, and now we want to show him that he's not running things anymore.  So, I enjoyed that period of my life, yeah.
Story_ID: 68272
Speaker 1: So, your middle school and part of high school was spent in Tuscaloosa [Alabama]?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Let's go back to your early school.  Any favorite teachers in elementary school?  Any special experiences?
Speaker 2: Well, one of the, my favorite... one of my favorite teachers there was a teacher called Mrs. Reese.  She was an English teacher.  But in a small town like Demopolis, you know, most of the teachers had several different positions and duties.  You know, even though she was an English teacher, you know, she took care of the social groups.  And all of those things had to come under her, like what you call the YAACP or, you know, different various little groups that we had at school.  And I think that she, she, she molded... I think she molded more people at [U.S.] Jones High [School] than any one particular teacher that was there, even though she was very strict.  But everybody loved her.  We had a, we had a principal there who was a cousin.  A.J. Rowser was his name, and he was a loved person.  Because I think he, he was the first person that I knew that saw sports, realized sports was going to be a real big thing.  I remember him used to... we used to have meetings there.  And he used to tell us, we used to talk about--well, Willie Mays was a star then, and [HM] Ernie Banks and those guys.  And they were, they were not making anywhere near the dollars that these ballplayers are making now.  And they were much--you know they have records that still have not been broken.  As a matter of fact, [Barry] Bonds is now trying to get Willie Mays'--well, he's next in line, which I think he probably will catch his record.  But he used to tell us then, he says, "Now, you know, you guys don't realize it now.  But one day, athletes is going to be making much, much more money than professional people."  And by a professional, he meant teachers and doctors and lawyers and that sort of thing.  And everybody really thought he was crazy.  So, he built a program around that school based on sports, okay.  And we played games all over.  We even had schools that was coming from Chicago [Illinois] coming down to play.  Because we, that school was pretty well known for sports as well as academics... as well.  But it was very, it was very instrumental in sports.
Story_ID: 68273
Speaker 1: What kind of student were you?
Speaker 2: You have to remember, too, during those years class sizes were--graduating classes were only like about forty... thirty-eight, forty people.  (Laughter).  And that sounds, seems crazy, but that's the size.  And we had one of the largest classes there, which was forty-two people, and we thought that was unbelievable.  But out of that, out of those forty-two individuals, I was third in the class.  You know, I wasn't the top student, but I was right there, yeah.
Speaker 1: Did you like school?
Speaker 2: Oh, absolutely.  In a small town like Demopolis [Alabama], it wasn't--you had two choices.  You go to school, or you go and play pool or something like that, you know.  And from the type of family I was from that just was, that was just--wasn't allowed.  But if you didn't go to school, there was nothing else to do.  School was, you know, life.  I mean, you enjoyed it.  You wouldn't miss it for anything.  I don't think I ever missed a day, you know, in the years that I went to school.  I mean it was just strictly, it was your life.  You enjoyed it.  There were times when it would get very hot.  And there were no air-conditioners in the school, you know, obviously.  And when it would get like 100, 105, 110 degrees, we had the type principal that said, he'd come in and say, "Hey, look, let the kids out.  Let them play baseball."  We had school, you know, school teams, you know, and class teams.  And he would just say, you know, "Rather than let them go home, let's go out and enjoy that."
Story_ID: 68274
Speaker 1: So, you did, you came back home and finished your senior year with your class [at U.S. Jones High School in Demopolis, Alabama].  And right after you graduated from high school, is that when you went on to Chicago [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  When I graduated from high school, as I said earlier--you know, I had... there was three--I had three brothers that was already in college at the time.  So I couldn't, I couldn't very well go to school there.  And I didn't, and I left there and came to Chicago.  I had an aunt that lived--my father's [Abe Brown] sister--that lived here in Chicago.  And at that time, on the West Side.  And I came here.  The second day I was here--I wasn't accustomed to that kind of poverty, you know.  (Laughter).  I mean, it was a different type.  When I say that kind... it was a different type in the sense that in the South you were poor, but you didn't realize you were poor.  You know what I'm saying?  Everybody was poor, so you didn't realize it.  But when you came to Chicago and you saw the difference--if you would get in your car and you ride down Michigan Avenue or you would drive the Outer Drive up to Highland Park or those areas, and you see homes that are bigger than schools--and then you come back to the West Side and then you, you see that big difference.  And you know, and you know, in those years I knew something was really wrong.  You know, something was seriously wrong.  So, the second day I was here, I called, called my mother [Josephine Mullen-Brown] and asked could I come back home.  I said I can't--
Speaker 1: What year was that?
Speaker 2: That was in 1962.
Story_ID: 68275
Speaker 1: Okay, so you're in Chicago [Illinois] with your father's [Abe Brown] sister.  And you see this marked difference in life and lifestyle.  What kind of adjustment did you make to that?
Speaker 2: Well, it's--first let me say it this way.  I had come into a different world, where at that time the West Side [Chicago, Illinois] was heavily, heavily made up of drugs and alcohol.  I just wasn't familiar with that, you know.  I couldn't, that wasn't part of my lifestyle.  And you know, my aunt was the type of person that she never let that affect her, you know, or her children.  You know, she said, "Well, these are the things that's usually..." a lot like my father.  She... my father--that particular sister and his brother, Tom Brown, they were very, very close, the three of them.  You know they grew up together, and they were close.
Speaker 1: What location on the West Side?
Speaker 2: That was about 3800 around Van Buren at that time, yeah, right at Pulaski.  And the gang situation, that's when you had the Vice Lords and the Cobras and all of these, all of these gangs that was, you know, that really, they were flourishing during that time.  So, I couldn't, I couldn't get accustomed to that.  And the most important thing, my reason for being here was to come here and get a job and go to school.  And I never lost track of that, okay.  So, I couldn't... when I got here in June [1961], I couldn't get a job.  I tried to get a job.  And everything was based on a job, an income, so I could go to school.  And my aunt, she says, "Well, you know, I won't charge anything until you get a job.  And then once you do, then you have pay."  And I understood that.  So, finally I went to Spiegel [direct marketing and catalog company] where most people went.  When everybody was going back to school, I talked to [HM] Miss Ora Higgins, which most people know.  I don't whether you... if she's been on this yet or not.  But Miss Higgins was there.  And I talked with her like a lot of people did to try to get a job.  And she got me a job there, which was roughly then about September.  So, I couldn't go to college right away.  And Christmas, I guess around Christmas, you get laid off.  So, I got laid off.  So, I couldn't, that meant that I couldn't go to school in January.  Finally, I went to a place--I had a distant relative that worked at a place called CPC International, which was Corn Products, out in Argo, Illinois.  And he was able to get me a job there.  And I got a job there, and they paid very decent wages, because it was, you know, a union situation and they paid a nice income.  So, I took a job there working from eleven to seven like my father, and going to school [at Chicago State University in Illinois] during the day.  But I found that I couldn't stay awake.  So, I talked to my supervisor and I was able to get a position there as a lab technician working from three to eleven.  I would work from three to eleven, and then the next morning I would go to college.  I would always take the first class, which was like a 7:45 or 8:00 class, and I would go to college up until 2:45, then go back to work at 3:30 that afternoon.  And I did this until I graduated from college.

Speaker 1: And what was your academic interest at the time [at Chicago State University in Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Well, actually, you know, here again, having a southern background, the majority of the people in the South were teachers, you know.  And you looked up to teachers.  Teachers then were very important people, especially with children that they saw that really wanted to do something with their lives.  They tried to encourage you to go to college, just like your parents did.  Teachers at that time were like parents, because they took special interest in all the children.  And by the classes being thirty, thirty-five people... I mean the whole graduating class, not just a particular class.  It was a lot of one on one, you had that.  And we couldn't even relate to that until I came to Chicago [Illinois].  When you say, well, you got thirty people in one class, you only had twelve people in a class there... eight people in a class, you know.  Because especially most of the classes were divided... you had three different groups.  So if you only had, you know, twenty people in class, you know, you don't have that many in each group.  And I think that's why education... we learn...  I think at that time, in my opinion, a child that graduated from high school in the South was just as astute as a northern child graduating from college, I think, because you got it.  You know, their concept was is that you don't have all the books you need, but being that you don't have the books, just read what's in that book; and it's there, you know.  My father [Abe Brown], where he went to school, they only went to the eighth grade, okay.  He stayed in the eighth grade four years to satisfy himself that he graduated from high school.  And that's a fact.  This is not anything that's made up; that's a fact.  Those schools in the rural area, if you wanted to go finish school, you had to come to the little towns like Demopolis [Alabama].  The rural areas only went to eighth grade--seventh or eighth grade.  And once you... they couldn't, he couldn't afford to come over to Demopolis, so he just stayed in eighth grade for four more years.  And when he, you know, said that to me, I said, "Why would you do that?"  He said, "I wanted to go to school just like I want you kids to go to school."  But getting back to Chicago...  In that environment I was in, nobody wanted to go to college.  You know, and it could have been very, very easy to be swayed in the other direction--to be in jail, to be a pusher, drug pusher, or to be a drug addict.  But if you weren't strong--and keep in mind, I had no brothers and sisters here.  I had one aunt here.  And the environment that you were in, if you weren't strong you just wasn't going to make it.  And that's when, what I understood then for the first time what they meant by survival of the fittest.
Story_ID: 68277
Speaker 1: So, you kept yourself busy with school and work?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And you had very little social life?
Speaker 2: Almost no social life.  It's, it's almost... that's like now when, you know, my sons would tell me, "Well, Dad, I don't understand how you can work all these hours."  That's because I never had time, I never had any free time basically.  Because, you know, if you're working from three to eleven every day, and then you're going to school five days a week, full-times, just like...  You know, because I wanted to be able to have a car, I wanted to look nice.  And in order to do that I needed a full-time job.  A part-time job just wasn't going to help me.  Because I had to pay rent, you know, and things of that nature.  And so, I chose to work...  And you'd be surprised of the people that will help you along the way when they know you're serious about what you're doing.  You know, you had a lot of people that was in my household that would say, "Oh, you know, he ain't going to graduate.  He's just, you know, he's wasting time."  You know, but that was their concept.  I mean they, they didn't say it out of hate or dislike; they said it because they really believed that's what it was going to be.  Because they had--one of my favorite cousins was a guy by the name of Mingo Nixon.  Mingo had gone to junior college for about seven or eight years.  When I got here, he was still going.  But it was a play thing.  I mean, it wasn't nothing serious about it.  But with me, I said, "Look I'm going, and I'm going to graduate."  You know, even the people at Corn Products [CPC International], they said, "Well, you know you're not going to graduate; you'll get tired."  But it was no big deal to people now, because it's almost to the point now where that's just part of life; you just graduate from high school and you go to college or go to grad school.  But at that time, it wasn't part of life, you know.  It was something that you had to... you chose to do.  And it's something that you had to be strong to do it.  Because money was, money was not there.  Later on in the seventies [1970s], money became available for black students to go to college.  But early, in the earlier years there weren't, there weren't any so-called money available.
Speaker 1: So, did you, what did you choose to major in?
Speaker 2: Well, my major was education; I was an education major.  And then later on, I took business administration courses.  And when I was teaching school--you know I taught school for about two and a half, three years--a gentleman by the name of Carl Dennoms (ph.), who was the principal at Burnside High School, he encouraged me.  He said, "Look, why don't you just go and take some administrative courses and get your degree, get your master's, so you can become a principal; then later on become a superintendent or whatever," because he saw something there.  But I got away one summer when I had got, after I had got out of grad school.  There was a program that Goodyear [Tire and Rubber Company] offered, an eight week program.  And I saw it as a summer of making some extra money, not so much the program.
Speaker 1: What year was this?
Speaker 2: That was in 1969; that was in 1969 when I went into that program.  And then I never got back to teaching, yeah.
Story_ID: 68278
Speaker 1: When you came here [Chicago, Illinois] and you were working, going to school [Chicago State University in Illinois], keeping yourself busy and trying not to be overwhelmed by the big difference in the environment...  Chicago, well, not just Chicago, but the country was like very politically active.  How did you fit into all that?  Or how did that fit into you?
Speaker 2: Well, the politics, the [Civil Rights] "Movement" as we called it then was part of life, you know.  I mean you, every day that you went to school, you talked about one day you're going to be equal.  That was just something, I mean that was something you talked about all the time--you know, equality.  Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] was someone that we knew.  [Ralph] Abernathy was from my hometown.  These were the movers and the shakers.  But what a lot of people don't know is that people like [HM Rev. Fred] Shuttlesworth... there were other people in the Movement that even came down from Chicago.  James Owens, [HM] Reverend [James] Bevel, all of these people came down to help the movement... [HM] Dorothy Tillman, very instrumental in the movement, you know, which was from Montgomery, Alabama.  They were, she didn't just get popular in Chicago.  Dorothy Tillman was a strong mover and shaker in Alabama.  You just, that was just part...  Now, I took six months out of school to go back in '68' [1968] for the Movement.  Because that was a part of life, the Movement.  You got to know all of these people, you know, on a first hand basis.  When Dr. King...  The Selma March [march from Selma to Montgomery in 1965], all my brothers... not all.  But my younger brothers and sisters--Rhonda, Threet--those last five, they were all a part of the movement.  When they marched from Selma to Montgomery and they came back, what a lot of people don't know is those schools--the superintendents--the white superintendents--made the principals make those kids lose that year.  They didn't get promoted.  My brother, Threet, my sister Rhonda, his wife whose name is Ira Jean--they weren't married at the time--but all of these kids lost a year of school.  They said, "Well, you're not going to graduate, you're not going to be promoted."  And most of the country is not aware of that.  And these are people that did this--children that did these things because it was just a part of your life.  It wasn't something that you had to be paid to do, or something that someone had to teach you or coach you to do.  It was just something that you wanted to do, because you wanted to, you wanted freedom.
Story_ID: 68279
Speaker 1: And when you think about freedom, a lot of people say, well, they don't relate.  It's like Kunta Kinte, who talked about freedom.  He said, "Well, if you get your freedom, where you going?"  You can't escape.  But that wasn't the thought.  That wasn't... as much as I love [Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.], as much as we grew up in that environment, sometimes you realize that that really was not the answer, you know.  And the reason I say that is because sometimes when you talk in terms of integration, it just don't work in a sense, so to speak.  But, but Dr. King to us was like, like a God.  And he--
Speaker 2: What do you mean, it doesn't work?
Speaker 1: Well, in the sense that we were taught in the South at that time that integration would solve a lot of our problems.  Because they felt--integration and equality is two different things.  But we saw it as one and the same, okay.  You figure that if you integrate, then equality would be there, but that's not the case.  And answering your question, what happened?  What happened after Martin Luther King integrated the schools in the South?  What happened after we were able to sit down at a lunch counter?  What happened after we got to the point where we could ride a bus on the front seat?  What happened after Rosa Parks decided that that day I'm too tired, I'm not getting up?  And she just, boom, went right into history, simply because she said, "This day I am not moving, I'm not getting up," okay.  Now, what happened after all of these things?  The schools--at that time, the South that I knew, we had our school, they had theirs.  They had the better books.  We took the books that they got through with, and four or five years later they gave them to us, okay.  This is the way it was.  But we read, we still read those books, and we still learned what we had to learn from those books.  But after integration, they closed the black schools, sent all of the kids to the white schools, and we were right back being taught inferiority.  Separate... being separate is not equal either.  But being integrated doesn't make, is not going to make you just as equal.  What happened to the stores?  What happened to the black businesses?  Case in point: In my little hometown, before integration...  Don't misunderstand me, I love Dr. King, and I think his program was wonderful.  But the concept wasn't carried on.  We had, we had a black barbershop; we had two, okay.  We had a black pool hall.  We had a black recreation center.  We had black morticians.  We had two black funeral homes.  After integration, we had none.  They've gone.  We had... the Weiss brothers had two major grocery stores, but they're gone.  Once, after integration, all of these businesses was gone.  Because now they came with modernized stores, a store called Food Basket in that town--had everything that you need.  So, we no longer shopped with that brother, okay.  So, those brothers that had those businesses lost those businesses.  The same situation... that's a smaller scale... the same situation in Chicago [Illinois] on a larger scale.  We're fighting now just to stay in business.  After the Enron situation [Enron scandal in 2001], right today the average black entrepreneur can't even go to the bank and borrow money to save his business.  You know what they tell you now?  "Go take your home, mortgage your home, you can get it a lower interest rate."  So, when things doesn't go as well, you're going to lose that, too.  That's not the whole concept, but basically this is what the situation is.  You have contractors right now, they can't even get bond money for them to get bonds to get these major jobs.  You go to the bank, they say "Well, after the Enron situation, we can't take those chances anymore."  But whose fault is that?  You know, we're small entrepreneurs.  Do we have to go out of business simply because we can't get loans?  Do have to mortgage my home to get a two-hundred thousand dollar loan?  When these companies has done a wrong deed--has lied... and they always lie about these things.  And then you come back and borrow fifty billion dollars, thirty-three million dollars--but we can't do that.  We have to mortgage our home to get a lousy two hundred thousand dollars.  I don't think that's the answer.  And this is what has happened in the South.  We have, we have created integration, and from the concept of Dr. King, it worked and it still should work, but in the end it defeated the purpose.
Story_ID: 68280
Speaker 1: So you have gone through school, you taught awhile, you decided to take this Goodyear [Tire and Rubber Company] seminar--and just really to get some extra money, but you got hooked.  How did that happen?
Speaker 2: Well, as [Dr. Martin Luther] King [Jr.] always said, "A man should live out his true meaning."  That's what he believed you should be doing.  The tire business has never been something that I really wanted to do; it still isn't.  But it's a means of economics, it's a means of money.  It's a means of entrepreneurship.  But this is, this is... really has not been my goal.  But when I got tied into this, actually, teaching I liked better.  But it doesn't provide you with the income that you need in all cases when you're married and have a family.  So I got married and I say, well, I have to look for something else to do.
Speaker 1: When did you, what year did you get married?
Speaker 2: I got married in 1972.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And your wife's name?
Speaker 2: Her name is Jane, Jane Mall, maiden name; Jane Brown after we were married.  And my grandmother, my dad's mother's name was Jane Brown, yeah.  But in 1986, we were divorced.  And we have two sons, twins.  And they chose to stay with me, so I raised my sons as a single parent, you know.  And that--getting back to answering your question, what entrepreneurship does for you especially in the early years--instead of your business being a slave for you, you become a slave for it.  That's how I lost my wife.  Basically, because there were no time.  And one thing that I've learned about femininity is that you have to give it, you have to treat it like a business.  Or you have to make a marriage--the only way a marriage is going to work, you know, you have to treat it like a business.  I mean you got, you have to give the person time, and you have to enjoy one another.  And I was continually told, "Well, I'm not happy.  I'm not satisfied with this situation."  The money wasn't it.  And my train of thinking was, "If I can make this almighty dollar, everything will be fine."  Just like Martin Luther, "Well, if I get this integration, everything's going to be fine."  But you find out there's another side to it.  And in the process, I lost something dear, because I was trying to, trying to make things better.  Because we were, we basically was raised in that sense.  But my father [Abe Brown] was successful in staying with my mother.  They were successful in having these children together, and they taught us good things.  And I thought that's the way--I took for granted that that's the way--once you marry, you marry for life.  And I took for granted that it was going to work.  And I can't, you know, really blame anybody for that, other than, other than being an entrepreneur.  An early entrepreneur had to...  Let me re-phrase that.  An early black entrepreneur has to put a lot of time into what he believes that he can do, okay.  And in doing so... I'll give you an example.  Malcolm [X] died young.  Martin died at thirty-nine.  Because these are people, they're movers and shakers.
Story_ID: 68281
Speaker 1: But what I've learned from these people is one of the things that [Dr.] Martin [Luther King, Jr.] always said, Dr. King, is that "Longevity is not the case."  You know, it's what you do and believe in, you know.  Sometimes it takes--I mean here's a man who did so much in thirty-nine years, it's unbelievable.  But sometimes it takes others longer.  I felt like that I could be the Martin Luther King of the tire business, or the Michael Jordan of the tire business. That was, that's how I felt.  I said if Goodyear [Tire and Rubber Company] could run seventeen hundred stores across the country, I sure could run a hundred and seventy stores across the country.  And that's the way I felt, not realizing that these obstacles are going to be there.  You know, when the economy goes up or down, we're the first one to lose out because we can't get loans.  We can't get the money we need to keep us going.  I remember in 1972 when I opened Cottage Grove, that was the first store.  I couldn't, I was incorporated actually in 1969, but we didn't do anything until later.  We couldn't get any loans.  What we had to do was pool...  Seven, the seven brothers, we had to pool the little money that we had saved.  We couldn't get nothing from the SBA [the U.S. Small Business Administration], we couldn't get nothing from the banks.  We couldn't get anything from anybody.  We approached the banks and said, "Well, we want to open a tire store," after I had gone through this program.  They say, "Well, what you should do is maybe perhaps try to open a gas station first," you know.  So you know, "I mean I'm a college graduate, I'm not--I don't want to open a gas station.  You know, I mean I want to start on a different level."  So, the point that I'm trying to make here is that when you--when you're really looking to do something, you have to realize that the opposite side--those obstacles are there.  And the funds are not there, okay.  But that doesn't stop you in many cases.  Now, when I went into this business, Goodyear had what you call an umbrella.  I went in as a franchise.  You know, later I became an independent dealer, which I'm not a franchise.  You know, I was only a franchise for about a year and a half or two.  But when I went into this business, they had what you call... everything--an umbrella package.  You know, they would, you could get your insurance through them.  You could get everything, so you wouldn't be out there by yourself, or someone would say "No, because we can't take the risk."  So, you were kind of protected.  You know, especially--this was a program designed especially for the few blacks that got into this program.  Because they knew you wasn't going to be able to go to the bank and get any money.
Story_ID: 68282
Speaker 1: Okay. So, a year later they [Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company] decide, they say, "Okay, well, these guys, they..."  It was seven of us across the country.  They say, "Well, now they can stand on their own."  As soon as that happened--when the insurance umbrella dropped and all of these umbrellas dropped--right away I couldn't get any insurance.  I couldn't get any liability insurance.  When I say insurance, for the company--you know for the trucks, for the tires that you got back there, the inventory.  Nobody would give me insurance.  They said, "Well, you're in the type of business where there's a lot of liability, a lot of risk. You could put on some brakes and somebody can go out there and get hurt or get killed."  And couldn't get it.  Allstate [Corporation], all the... everybody I went to.  This is where [HM] Dempsey Travis came in.  Dempsey Travis at that time was a mortgage broker, you know, as well as was in real estate.  And I had nobody else to call.  I called him and I said, "Can you help me?"  He says, "Well, Son, you can come over and see me and we can talk about it."  I went over, we talked.  And I said, "I, you know, right now I'm running a business, running two stores without any liability, and I need help."  He says, "Well, if you call this, call this company..."  I said, "I've called everybody, and I can't get anything."  Well, what happened with Goodyear, well, Goodyear decided to let us go, okay.  Then finally... and that's one of the primary reasons why I can't speak of anything bad about Dempsey Travis, is because of the fact that he helped me when I needed help.  We got, we got an insurance package.  And ever since then, then later on, he became my kids' godfather.  And we just have a relationship ever since then.
Speaker 2: Did he do any packages for the other seven across the country?
Speaker 1: Yeah, he did, he did.  At one point he had all... basically all of my business.
Speaker 2: So, your request to him really kind of lumps him in the insurance area?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Because he went out and found it.
Speaker 1: He went out and found me... right.
Speaker 2: Seven--
Speaker 1: Locations.
Speaker 2: Goodyear locations?
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Because he, he had more clout, you know.  I was a young entrepreneur just trying to stay alive.  And he was, you know, he had a strong clout.  So, these people would listen to him a little better than they would listen to me. Well, they wouldn't, I couldn't even get through the door, you know.
Speaker 2: So, he was helpful to you, and you helped in bringing him a package of people?
Speaker 1: Absolutely.  So, we really helped each other for a long time.
Speaker 2: So that inter-dependence is what's so important for African-American businesses?
Speaker 1: It's very important.  Because from then... It triggered off in 1979, he began to get properties that, you know, he didn't...  He says, "Well..." you know, he couldn't buy it all.  So, he called me and says, "Well, are you interested in doing some real estate deals?"  I said, "Well, yeah."  You know, because in business you need to expand and diversify, you know.  So, that was my opportunity.  And I started at that time getting over into real estate then, you know, buying buildings like sixty flats and forty flats, and getting small ones--all sizeable of buildings, and we formed another relationship from that.  And then as I would... he promised me at that time, he said, "If you get the property, I'll manage the property.  You don't have to look for tenants, I'll do that."  So, we formed a different relationship from that time on.
Speaker 2: Okay.  And what about the other seven, the other six Goodyear businesses?
Speaker 1: Now, these were stores that family... if you remember, I said there were seven of us that was into this; that got into this situation.  And other brothers was involved.  We had two stores in Cleveland [Ohio] at that time.  I was President and Chairman of the Board, and we had two stores in Cleveland.  My oldest brother, Ralph [Brown], was running that store.  My other brother, Abe [Brown], was running the other store on Lee Road, those two stores.  I had a brother, Threet [Brown], who was running the store down in Atlanta [Georgia].  And my brother Matt [Brown] was running the store in New York [New York City, New York], and then I had the three stores here.  My brother, Winston, was the general manager of these stores.  I had another home boy that was running the store at 87th and Constance.  And a fellow from Gary, Indiana by the name of Gary Harris, who was a friend of the family, he was running the store on 95th and Western.  At that time things were booming, because you had people with concepts of wanting to have things.
Story_ID: 72089
Speaker 1: You had this series of [tire] stores.  What period was that?
Speaker 2: From 1970 through 19--when we opened them, from 1970 up to 1977.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: During that period.
Speaker 1: And the booming years were?
Speaker 2: The booming years were the seventies and eighties.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you still have seven stores?
Speaker 2: No, I have currently five stores.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Okay.  What I do now, instead of running them all, I have what you call... I lease them.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Because the idea of it is... is that when my brothers started getting burned out in the business--well, we call it burnout.  Then for an example, like my brother, Ralph [Brown], you know, he lives in Atlanta [Georgia]now.  He was running the store in Cleveland, and he started an architectural firm, because he actually was an architect with my other brother, TarLee.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, they have an architectural firm there.  My brother, Threet [Brown], who is running the store in Atlanta, he and my sister Rhonda--who went to the University of Alabama [in Tuscaloosa] during the [Georgia] Wallace time--they started a business called "Boss" which means... you know, they have an office supply business.  They teamed together.  Because I think at that time in their life, what they were looking for was more time to spend with themselves.  They decided to get out of the retail end and just get into the areas where they'd sell office furniture and that sort of thing, and by appointment.  So, it's serving that purpose very well.
Speaker 1: Oh, great.
Speaker 2: And they're doing quite well.
Speaker 1: So, that was the store you closed?
Speaker 2: Right.   That's the store that... right, that I leased.
Speaker 1: In Atlanta.
Speaker 2: I closed that one, in Atlanta.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And now you lease it to other entrepreneurs?
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: And you help them with the whole package?
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: But you don't put them out to pasture like Goodyear [Tire and Rubber Company]. (Laughter).
Speaker 2: No, no.  (Laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 72090
Speaker 1: So after Goodyear [Tire and Rubber Company] put you out to pasture, so to speak, after a year the first big challenge was insurance.  Then what kind of other things happened?
Speaker 2: Well, there were many, several other different situations.  For example, like at 95th and Western, in Evergreen Plaza, now I opened that store in 1974.  And you know in 1970--well, of course Evergreen Plaza [Evergreen Park, Illinois] was the first shopping center in the United States.  It was built in 1959 by a guy named Arthur Rubloff, okay, who was a very flashy, wealthy man.  And Rubloff was, he was the type of person, he owned all of the property out there.  You know, it was a one man show.  And the guy that actually owned that piece of property where I had my business is, he was president, well, chairman of the board of the Beverly Bank at that time, who was also a Jewish fellow.  But he chose not to sell that piece of property to Rubloff when he was retiring and going to Florida.  He told me, he came by and says, "You're the only person that can use this.  You're here, you're leasing, and how would you like the opportunity to purchase it?"  I said, "Fine."  I said, but it's kind of strange, you know, that you would sell me a piece of property that's..."  Well, Rubloff owned everything else.  He says, "Before I sell him this property, I'll give it to you."  That's what he said.  I don't know what their problem was, but I appreciate him to this day that that happened.  And from that day on, I had nothing but problems--nothing but problems there.  When I say problems, you know, violations about this, violations about that.  You know, there was just a number of, number of problems that was happening.  So, I called Mr. Rubloff and I asked him could I meet with him.  He says, "Well, yeah."  He gave me a date, and I came and met with him.  And I asked him, "Are you aware of the things that are happening to me out here?"  He says, "Yeah."  He says, "I'd like to buy that piece of property."  I said, "Well, you own all the other properties.  I don't understand the issue here.  You know, you own everything else.  What's this little piece of property going to do?"  He says, "Well, I don't like anybody owning anything where I am.  So, I'll pay you a dollar more than you paid for it."  I said, "No, I don't think it's going to work like that."  I said, "If you offer me a fair price, then I think if I chose to do that, then I'll consider it."  But he said, "No, I'll give you a dollar more than you paid for it, and that's the extent of it."  I said, "Well, first of all, I don't want to sell it.  And second of all, if I did, I don't think I would sell it to you, with the type of attitude you have."  So, he says, "Well, look, let me tell you something."  He said, "I don't want you there, and I want you to understand I don't want you there."  He said, "Because you people don't know how to run a business.  You people don't keep things up.  And I think that you'll be better off..."  At that time... right now where they built the Orland Park Shopping Center [Orland Square Mall in Orland, Illinois], he had bought most of that property out there.  And he says, "Look, I'll... if you give up this business, I'll then open you a store in Orland Park, where in the next twenty-five years it's going to be unbelievable," which it is.  "But in the meantime..." I said "...in the meantime, if I took the offer that you're giving me, I would be out of business in the next six months." Because you didn't have the people there then.  That was a shopping center up and coming.  You couldn't survive it.  And I said to him, "You know, you could survive it, because you have those kind of funds.  I couldn't survive it, because I need instant business.  And that's the only way a black American can exist, it has to be instant.  You can't wait five years.  You can't wait ten years.  I mean it has to be instant, especially during those years.  Because I knew that banks wasn't going to loan me any money.
Story_ID: 72091
Speaker 1: And that's, that's pretty much the problems that you encounter in that sort of business.  The day to day problems you encounter...  It doesn't matter how long...  One thing I've discovered, it does not matter how long you've been in business or how successful you've been... you're still going to be treated just like you started yesterday.  I've encountered that.  I mean, you know when I... two years... three years ago, when Goodyear [Tire and Rubber Company] did a commercial saying that we make tires like a black man's lips, I couldn't believe it. This was something that they apologized for, and said it was done without them realizing that it was going to be actually done.  And at that time I did file suit, because I felt like I was going to have a problem... create a problem for me and my business, which it did, you know, it did.  Just like if... there's no way in the world that Firestone [Tires] could have as many recalls as they had and it doesn't affect the business.  I mean, that's just common knowledge.  It doesn't, it doesn't make any difference in terms of--at least you think at the time that it wouldn't make any difference, because you felt like... feel like you're doing the job.  But that's not true.  In the case of [HM] George Johnson of Johnson Products, when they made him put that label on his product saying that it could be hazardous to your hair, he didn't overcome that.  You know, his sales started going from $66 million coming the other way rather than climbing.  And Clairol later on bought that business out--the same way with [HM] Mr. [Edward] Gardner, bought that business [Soft Sheen Products] out.  Now, we have reasons as to why we want to sell and why we want to get out, because we get burned out.  And that's not, that's not anything that's unusual, you know.  Because as businesspeople, you get tired like anybody else.  Sometimes Mr. Gardner, the tremendous job that he did with that business, started selling his product out of the back of his car and turned this into a conglomerate.  It's just amazing how these things have happened.  But at the same time, when these things happen, if you don't grow with the flow, it will create misery for you.  Because the company grows so fast until you don't have enough loyal people that surround you; it creates such astronomical problems.  And if you don't have loyalty, you're just not going to last.  And this is what happened to many, many, many of our businesses.  If you can remember in the seventies when things were booming--unfortunately under the [President Richard] Nixon administration--when things were booming for black Americans right here in Chicago, you had twelve to fifteen black automobile dealers in this town.  Today you have zip.  You had the R.L. Dukes, you had the [HM] Al Johnsons... you had the Alvin Lees.  I mean you had all of these people.  You had the brothers down on State, Lincoln Mercury.  You had Horace Noble.  You had Bob Neal.  All of these were entrepreneurs that were on the South Side of this city doing very well; doing millions.  But all of a sudden now you look, where are these people?  What happened?
Speaker 2: Which that was good company for your business.
Speaker 1: Absolutely.  Because these people were buying tires from me.  They were buying products from me.
Speaker 2: And that inter-dependence again.
Speaker 1: Absolutely.  And all of these people that I knew very, very well.  Bob Neal land I lived in the same building, 5471 Hyde Park Boulevard for years.  Horace Noble, I know very well.  R.L. Duke, we were very good friends.  Al Johnson, whom I respect to the hilt, first black car... automobile dealer in the world, in America, I should say.  I won't say in the world, but in America.  But you say, what happened to these companies?  What happened?  He had two sons, Al, Jr. and his other son.  Why aren't they running these businesses?  Mr. Gardner, why aren't they running these businesses?  Now, they've taken this business and put it over where Johnson Products used to be.  It's, it's just amazing how we can get there, and we can't give these businesses to our children.
Story_ID: 72092
Speaker 1: Your sons [Johnny M. Brown, Jr. and Joshua Brown], do they work in your business?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  My sons, they graduated from Clark [University in Worcester, Massachusetts], and now they're, I'm basically training them to take over this business.  Hopefully, whether it's staying in this particular business or using your entrepreneurship to do something else, it's fine.  You know, but I think it's something that our children need to be accustomed to. Because these doors are not going to open with this banking situation until we do something about it.  I mean you cannot--anybody knows common sense.  You can't--if you don't grow in business, you're going to die.  I mean, that's common... you can't stay the same.  You know, nothing stays the same.  And if you don't have the avenues to get these dollars and grow, you're just not going to make it.  I mean, I started in business when I was a kid.  All of my friends basically have been in business, with the exception of [HM] Dempsey Travis or [HM] Mr. John Johnson.  Everybody else has been, and the ones that have been successful has been in business and they're gone, you know.  And I've been in business now for thirty-two years.
Speaker 1: [HM] Mr. [Edward] Gardner's family was very active in the business up to the end, I guess, and beyond the end.
Speaker 2: Yes.  His son is starting a business, a similar business of his own, you know.  And they were very instrumental... and this is what you have to have.  Because if, like I said before, if you don't have it, it's just not going to work.
Story_ID: 72093
Speaker 1: So, how is it working with a major corporation like a Goodyear [Tire and Rubber Company]?  I'm sure there are some points where needs and desires dove-tail, and some points where it goes in the opposite direction than what you would normally take it.  How do you deal with that?
Speaker 2: Well, working with a major corporation like Goodyear or any other major corporation--in my case Goodyear--it's good...  If you're, if you're trying to start a business, it's very good to have that type of rapport with a major corporation, because they have systems that, you know, what you call franchises and things of that nature, and it helps you to get started.  But what happens is when, when they change their trend--the way they do things.  For example, now the Goodyear program is no longer geared towards stores.  It's geared toward mass merchandisers.  There was a time when I started in the business, Goodyear's loyalty was with the dealers, okay.  All of their loyalty was...  The first franchise program they started--like I said, there were seven of us.  They didn't have a franchise program.  We taught them the franchise program.  They didn't even know what to do, okay.  We made this franchise program for Goodyear successful.  But then once it became successful and they saw what it could do, okay, they utilized it and they used your concept and your ideas to make it grow, okay.  Then the next decade, they decided to say, "Well, we don't need these franchise programs anymore.  We'll get out of the franchise end of it.  And basically if you could, if you cannot afford to be an independent dealer--in other words, own yourself--then you don't need to be a part of the program, okay."  But in the last five years, they're selling off, they're getting out of the--not the tire business--but they're getting out of running the business.  They don't--like right now their tires, their program is called Just Tires.  They only sell tires; they don't do mechanical work anymore, okay.  They just sold off six hundred of the Penske [Truck Rental] stores.  They just sold off three hundred and fifty of the Brad Ragan stores.  These were stores that were actually Goodyear stores, but they've been given more popular names to make the product go, okay.  Now, they're... they used to tell their dealers like myself that we would never sell to a Sears [Roebuck and Company], or a Montgomery Ward's, or to a K-Mart, or to a Sam's Club.  In other words, we're telling you that the only way that you can buy a Goodyear tire is through a Goodyear dealer.
Speaker 1: And they can trash that.
Speaker 2: Okay.  About eight years ago, the same time that they were telling us down in Florida at a mass meeting that this was what the situation--two days later they were doing a press conference saying that they now was going to sell tires to Sears, and to Wards, and to K-Marts, and to Sam's Clubs.  So, that in itself broke the bind that the dealers had with Goodyear, okay.  You had a lot of lawsuits, because people were hurt from it.  You had some situations where--think of it in this manner.  Okay, if you've established your business, and it so happened to be across the street or down the street from a Sears, and all of a sudden Sears is selling the same product you're selling, now who do you think is going to survive?
Speaker 1: That's right.
Story_ID: 72094
Speaker 1: Okay, this is what happened to the dealers.  In many cases you had a lot of situations like that.  So you say "Well, where's the lawyer?"  There aren't any, you know.  Now, their whole program now is to sell to mass merchandisers and forget the dealers.  So, if you have not established yourself, you know, and stood your ground and your concept of what you're doing, you're just going to be out.  Because you always have to keep in mind, being a minority... I went to a meeting five years ago.  It used to be at least about fifteen or twenty independent black dealers.  It's only two.
Speaker 2: Only two now?
Speaker 1: Just that ridiculous.
Speaker 2: How many, what is the ratio of overall Goodyear dealers and the African-American dealers?  How does that number play out?  Forty to two?  You know, how many--
Speaker 1: You mean as compared to--
Speaker 2: Yeah, nationally.
Speaker 1: Nationally?
Speaker 2: How many Goodyear [Tire and Rubber Company] dealers, and how many of those dealers are African-American?
Speaker 1: I'll put it this way.  We had a--the last meeting--it wasn't the last--in [Las] Vegas [Nevada] three years ago.  I had a dealer that approached me; he had several locations in Kansas City [Missouri].  It was so unbelievable until he walked up to me and says, "Where are the blacks?"  Aren't there any black dealers anymore?"  I mean it's just that ridiculous.
Speaker 2: Was he black or white?
Speaker 1: He was white.
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: He was white.
Speaker 2: So, you were almost the only one of two or three--
Speaker 1: There are several reasons for that, okay.  One reason is that--like I said, in the tire business you have to, you really have to grow, you know.  Because you have to expand your area, you know, you have to have your plan to do that.  That's difficult to do without money.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  It's difficult to do when insurance rates--like last year [2001] insurance rates ran up twenty to twenty-five percent in the tire industry--in most industries, but especially in that industry.  You're already paying unbelievable amount of monies for these kinds of things.  And the cost of doing business that made it so difficult... until it's just incredible.  You still have your customer base, you still have your people.  But how are you going to spread this kind of increase back to your consumer?  You can't do it.
Speaker 2: And the marketing costs, what it requires to grow marketing-wise, can really be prohibitive.
Speaker 1: Exactly.
Speaker 2: Because you got to invest it, and then the people will buy.
Speaker 1: Exactly.  So, that means you have to spend funds in order to get the people to come, you know.  So, you have to--all of that has to be paid for.  And that's not nothing unusual, but what is unusual is this.  What is unusual is the game that is played in the marketplace.  By that, I'm saying you can pass by one day, you look up, it says "Goldblatt's."  The next day it will say "Target," or it'll say something else.  I mean then a year later you say, "Well, these companies filed bankruptcy."  Then two years later, they're right back again.  But now, are we allowed to do that?  We can't play that game; we can't get any money.
Speaker 2: Because a lot of times, having that credit line is--
Speaker 1: It's--
Speaker 2: --its dip in it as you need--
Speaker 1: Exactly.
Speaker 2: --and pay it back when--
Speaker 1: It's very, very, very impor--
Story_ID: 72095
Speaker 1: So, this is the difference.  I mean the primary difference is the credit line, the dollars and cents.  That's the primary difference.  I mean your company can grow.  You wonder sometimes, how can a company grow and they still go out of business.  But that's easy, you know, because of the amount of dollars that you're spending to get the customer to walk in, as we indicated earlier.  And the price that you're paying to do business, it just supersedes what you're doing.  And that's what makes it...  And that's not unusual. I mean, that's basically with any company.  But those companies on mass merchandising, and those companies like [Donald] Trump runs, and those companies like these people run, they have access to funds anytime that they want them.  You know, a few years ago he was supposed to have been broke.  Now all of a sudden, he's one of the richest men in America.  How did that happen?  Because it happened because he had access to go out and get some money.  That's the way it happens.  You know, and I'm saying that, you know, black entrepreneurs are not stupid; we know what it takes to stay alive.  But you have to continually ask yourself, "Why is it that the [HM Edward] Ed Gardners, and the [HM] George Johnsons, and the car dealers--I mean why is it that they're gone?"  I'm sure you get tired, you get burned out; I mean we all know that.  But if you go to the other phase, then you don't have to be there on a day to day basis.  But we can't ever get there.  I have never... I've been doing this for thirty-two years, and I'm not, I'm still not there.
Story_ID: 72096
Speaker 1: You know, because the loyal people that you started out with is not going to be the same people that you have, you know.  And--
Speaker 2: Which is another major factor.
Speaker 1: Major, major factor.
Speaker 2: Finding proper help.
Speaker 1: Absolutely.
Speaker 2: And I notice in some of your information you spend a lot of time, effort, and money shaping your employee base.
Speaker 1: Absolutely.
Speaker 2: So that you can get, maximize the return on the human capital.  Tell me something about how you work, and your philosophy regarding your employees.
Speaker 1: Well, you know, an employee base--you know, they're the lifeblood of your company, really, you know.  Because if you could do it all, then you would want a perfect company.  But you can't do it all, so you have to have people that are competent.  I mean you can't--you know it's always said that, you know, when you walk into our stores, our facilities that's it's not up to par, it's not clean; you know, you don't get treated with courtesy.  People I've found is willing to go into other areas and spend a large amount of dollars simply because someone is smiling in their face, you know.  But that doesn't mean that you're getting treated better; that means you're getting a smile.  So, my thing is if that's what you want, then I have, you have to have the people ready to do that.  If you're going to be competitive or stay in any business, you have to do what's necessary.  I mean you have to go out and see what your competitors are doing.  And if the competitors are doing a better job than you're doing, then you have to bring it back and teach your people that.  So, there are always programs that's available where... your mechanical force... that you can send them.  If they don't--for an example, cars have changed just like people change.  Cars are changed from when I first went into this business as to what they are now.  Cars at that time had carburetors and very little electronics on them.  Now everything is digital, just like the TV's and everything else; everything is digital.  So, a guy that worked on a car in '72' [1972] can't very well on a car in 2002, unless he's gone back to school.  So, that's something that you have to continue to do, invest dollars in your people to make sure that they can come back and do the job.  And if you don't do that, what you're going to do is you're going to lose the customer base.  Because the word then is going to be, "Well, I can't take my car there because they don't have anybody capable of doing the job."
Story_ID: 72097
Speaker 1: How has the turnover challenge been for you?
Speaker 2: It's tough.  It's tough.  I think basically that's, maybe one of the reasons, one of the reasons why large corporations like Goodyear [Tire and Rubber Company] made that decision.  They've been trying to make that decision for a long time to get out of the automotive end.  When I say automotive end, the mechanical end--actually doing the tune-ups and doing the brakes, and doing the shocks, and doing the front end alignments and that type of thing.  Because these people get paid a nice amount of money to do that.  You have to continue to... all the time send them to various schools to keep them abreast of the changes, okay.  The meetings that I used to go to from major corporations that had facilities like that--Montgomery Wards used to have these things; Goodyear had them.  You know, most of the mass merchandiser had them.  And they wanted to always get out, because they felt like these guys were prima donnas.  They want to call the shots, they want to...  If you tell them, you know, you want to give them some time off then you got to go through the unions.  And they felt that it was just too much of a headache to continue to run a business, and the cost factor is just too great.  You got to pay these guys major dollars; you have to pay them union scale.  You have to make sure that they go back to school, you have to buy them uniforms.  Then you have to contend with their attitudes.  And they felt like this is something that they wanted to get away from, as opposed to having, say, like the Just Tires.  Okay, you got a tire changer, you can pay them minimum wage, okay.  You don't have to let them work full-time; you can hire ten of them to work four hours a day like UPS [United Parcel Service] is doing.  You got one professional out there, and that's the guy that's doing the alignments.  Everybody else, you can hire them off the street and train them in six weeks.  And this is what they're trying--this is why their philosophy, their whole concept of doing business, has changed.  And in America, you know how that is. If you don't change when people change...  If you remember on the corner of 87th and Cottage [Grove] [Chicago, Illinois], there used to be a place called Kham and Nate [Shoes].  Do you remember Kham and Nate?
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: Okay.  When--
Speaker 1: Growth put them out of business.
Speaker 2: Absolutely, their growth put them out.  And then when the line of clothing changed, you know, from expensive suits, expensive ties, expensive shirts... expensive shoes--when the kids started wearing the gym shoes and the baggy pants...  So, you have to make a total turnaround, a concept that you don't even believe in, you know what I'm saying?  Well, you know, we're accustomed to selling these kinds of products, you know.  But if you don't make that change, you know, then you're going to lose.  And then when you expand at a rapid rate--but they were ready for it, basically.  You know but what happens is you need money to do that, and you need continual money to do that.  And if you can't--then you go to the bank and get it, then you have a serious problem.
Speaker 1: How many of your stores still do the mechanics, the car repairing?
Speaker 2: How many?
Speaker 1: How many of your stores?
Speaker 2: All of them.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Story_ID: 72098
Speaker 1: Because my concept is this.  Goodyear's [Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company] trend is--Firestone [Tires] of any of them--you know, their trend is to get away from that.  So, if you get away from that, somebody has to do that.  My logic is that what you leave and don't want, I'll take.  So, it has been successful for me.  I had a, two doors down from me is [HM County Commissioner] John Stroger's South Side office.  And I had Todd, his son, he came out the other day.  And he says, "Mr. Brown, are you all having a sale or something?"  I said, "No."  He said, "Well, your... this parking lot stays..."  You know, because I used to... you know, you can park on the lot whenever you choose, it wasn't no problem.  He said, "It stays busy."  That's because I've been a drum major in getting the business that they don't want, you know.  So, if you don't want it, I'll take it.  But you have to have the people to do it.  So, I have been spending my time on creating a program that they chose not to be interested in anymore, and I made it my choice.  Because the tire business has gotten to the point--and the reason for me doing that is because the tire business now has gotten so competitive.  In any words, if Goodyear--if you came to a Goodyear independent dealer or a Goodyear company-owned store, they wasn't going to give you more than say twenty-five percent off of a regular list price.  But you may go to Sam's [Club] or Pep Boys, or some of those type of places that's known for low-balling, and you can't be competitive, you know.  And if you are competitive, you might as well just roll them out of the door, because you're giving them away.  And many times, you find yourself having to do this.  But you have to remember, the bottom line is you can't do this and stay in business, okay.  So, you  have to--I said well, at the same time that you're dwelling on pushing independents out--whether it was purposely done or whether it's...  They say, "Well, we're making a change, because this is what we have to do."  You know, some major corporations make changes because this is what they have to do.  Okay, and I can relate to that.  So, rather than me taking it as an offensive situation or getting on the defense, I'm saying that, okay, you're going to...  Now, all these mass merchandisers now sell your product... make it difficult for me to be competitive.  But none of these people want to be bothered with the hard end of it, the mechanical end.  So, I'll take that end now, okay.  And this is what, this is really has kept me in business for the last seven or eight years.
Speaker 2: And you could also easily just fold off the mechanic part and do that, you know--
Speaker 1: Absolutely.
Speaker 2: Separate it from the tires.
Speaker 1: From, from--
Speaker 2: If you chose to do that.
Speaker 1: If I chose to do that, which I chose to now do towing, do road service, something I didn't do before, okay.  Because you have to be realistic.  You know, sometimes you have to make a choice, because someone else has made a choice for you, you know.   So, and I say, "Well, I never did towing before.  I'm saying now if this another avenue, then I need to take it, because these people want to come and spend some money with me.  So, I've got to make it easy for them to get to me."
Story_ID: 69028
Speaker 1: Okay.  We're going to come back to the business scene.  But let me rewind for a minute.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Because I'm hearing a lot of hard work and business, and I'm not seeing or feeling enough of Johnny Mack Brown, the man.  Now, you already have talked about, you know, your marriage [to Jane Mall Brown] coming apart because of your intense concentration on business, which you saw that as a good thing.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Unfortunately, we women don't see it like that all the time.  So, let's go back to early childhood.  What was the--what was the average day in the life of the Brown household like?
Speaker 2: Well, what the daily lifestyle of the Brown family was, you know, you get off to school, you go to school.  We had Hester [Brown], who was the eighth child.  My oldest sister [Dorothy Brown] was the first born, so she was gone a long time, okay.  Hester's job was to do the cooking for the family.  So, she was made to be very domestic at an early age for, you know, a bunch of boys.  Because between Hester and my oldest sister, it was all boys, okay.  And she, she grew up real fast, you know.  And in the South with big families like that, you have to grow up quick.  I mean, I think when I came to Chicago [Illinois] at seventeen years old, you had a mind of a thirty year old man, you know.  And so, growing up--and fortunately for me, I was able to grow up when my father [Abe Brown] was still living, even though I missed most of that time, because I was away.  But it was like a family.  And I remember the biggest project during the day was my mother [Josephine Mullen-Brown] trying to find a way to get enough food to cook for dinner.  I used to hear her talk about that all the time.  You know, she used to tell my father, "You know, I had no idea this morning what we would be eating for dinner this evening."  And I didn't quite understand that concept, because I'm saying he worked two jobs, three jobs.  But not realizing that with all of these children, it was a major project.
Story_ID: 69029
Speaker 1: But we had--to give you, to give you an idea of how twelve kids was stuffed in a home our size...  We had a living room.  Most of the homes in the South then was shotgun houses, okay.  By shotgun, I mean you could look through the front door directly right through the kitchen, right through the back door.  You know, there weren't any rooms on either side.  We didn't live in a shotgun house, but most of the shotgun homes, they used the living room as a living room and a bedroom; it also was a bedroom, okay.  But my mother [Josephine Mullen-Brown], even though with all of these children--being that she was raised a little bit different than my father--because they had a little bit more.  They had, they had a situation where they had a real living room that you didn't--you didn't sleep in there.  You didn't, you didn't, you know, sleep in the living room.  So, she says, "That's something I'm never...  I don't care how many children I have, I'm not going to ever permit anybody to sleep in my living room."  Okay, so the first bedroom, when you walked into the house to the left, was my mother and dad's room, okay.  In that room they had, their bed was on the north side of the house.  On the south side of the house, there, in that same room, which was the biggest room, the family room, there was another bed, okay.  And my two sisters-well, actually my...  Hester and my niece who was raised as one of us--my oldest sister's daughter--you know how they used to send the children back...  Okay, she was raised as one of us.  So, they shared that bed.  In the next room as you walk, there was two other beds in that room.  My brother TarLee and I shared that bedroom, and Winston and George shared the other room.  And then we had one other room that my father had attached to the house, which was a pretty nice house comparatively speaking to a lot of other homes in the South then.  Then my other two brothers was there.  And he, to the left--he made my oldest, my other brother--the oldest at the time which was Matt, the one who lives in New York [New York City, New York] currently--he had his own private room; he had his own bedroom.  And the reason for that was because when Matt was younger, he had one kidney removed, okay.  And they, at that time--you know, now you can live pretty good with one kidney.  But that was a shocker to everybody, and they treated him like, you know, he was like a...  He's the one that went to Kent State [University in Ohio] by the way, so he got all of the goodies because of his illness.  He was able to have his own room and he was able--when he graduated from high school, you know he had... with honors.  And he went to Kent State, and it was just unheard of then in '54' [1954], '55' [1955], that, you know, you just leave Demopolis [Alabama] and go to a college like Kent State.  So he, my father's concept then was I'm going to do for this child as much as I possibly can because of his illness; and he did that.  And the good thing about it was rather than this making us jealous--which in so many cases nowadays, it happens--we were encouraged by that.  We said, you know, if he can go to school way up there, then we can do the same thing.  And it was like a bootstrap type of thing; it worked, to that effect.  And my father was, he was very good at making you love your brother or love your sister, and I can respect him for that, yeah.

Speaker 1: So, what kind of sights, sounds, or smells remind you of your childhood?
Speaker 2: Odor out of outhouses.  (Laughter).  I mean everywhere down there [Demopolis, Alabama] that you could--that smell, it was that outhouse smell, you know.  Once you're on the outside, yeah.
Speaker 1: And the sights?
Speaker 2: The sights--rural areas of Chicago [Illinois].  You know, the South was, it was just different, you know.  I mean it was, the sight that I loved most about it was when you sit there on your porch and you look out at the street, and you could see actually the heatwaves coming.  And we used to see that all the time, you know.  You'd see a car coming up the street and you'd see all of these heatwaves just rising.  I mean it was unbelievably hot all the time, yeah.  The winter months, you didn't even have to--the most you would have to wear was a trench coat, if that.  We played basketball, football, everything year-round without even wearing a coat at all.

Speaker 1: Okay.  So, when you grew up, you were a young college student [at Chicago State University in Illinois] I imagine when you met your wife [Jane Mall Brown]?  What was your social life like in that period?
Speaker 2: Well, when I met my wife, I had no intentions of getting married, you know, none whatsoever.  Because I just felt like that would be an interference, (Laughter) I did.  That's the way I truly felt, you know.
Speaker 1: Late sixties [1960s], early seventies [1970s]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: You didn't have time for marriage.
Speaker 2: During the Civil Rights, you know, Movement.  And the thing I couldn't get by was, I married a Caucasian at the time during the Civil Rights Movement.  Because you know, during the Civil Rights Movement, [Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.]... there was a lot of togetherness, you know.  You know, when we did the marches, there was a lot of...  And from the...  And most of the people, most of the people that was doing... in the marches were college students, you know.  And you met, you met through that.  That was the means that you met different people.  And from there, it came back to Chicago and it got more serious.  But I still wasn't ready for the marriage situation, and, but it happened.  You know how women can be.  I mean, you know, when they make up their mind, they've made up their mind.  And if you're not strong enough to say no and walk away, you're caught, you know.  (Laughter).  So, I was given an alternative, either you do it or you walk.  So, I said " Okay."  So, finally I was convinced, and we did it.  And believe it or not, I never bought an engagement ring.  We were down in Old Town [Chicago, Illinois].  I got one of them little old rings from, you know, when they were selling them out there on the street whatever.  We went, we got married on the lunch... our lunch hour.  I was teaching school at the time; she was going to, she was an attorney, she was going to law school.  Got married on lunch hour, she went back to work and I went back to work.  (Laughter).  It was, it was unbelievable.
Speaker 1: This was in 1972?
Speaker 2: Nineteen Seventy-Two [1972].  We didn't live together for another two years, because she had an apartment and I had my own apartment.  I said, "Well, we can't live together because my lease is not up."  (Laughter).  So, I was able to get away with that for two more years, because I couldn't get right for that marriage situation.  (Laughter).  When I think about it, it's just crazy.  My parents, my mother [Josephine Mullen-Brown] didn't know about it until a year and a half later.  Nobody knew, I didn't tell anybody.
Speaker 1: So, you weren't very social?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Like, you know, like the relation... you know how you meet somebody at a party?
Speaker 2: No, it really wasn't that, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Then when it went into--that all happened at the time I'm trying to be an entrepreneur.  And unfortunately, that just triggered everything, made everything bad.  You know, because I was just spending too much time...  I became a slave to the business, you know.  And I know, I will tell my children now, never do that.  Never become... let it... you know, don't be a slave.  And I'm still a slave to the business, you know.  But that's not the way to go, but sometimes this is what you have to do to stay in business.
Story_ID: 69032
Speaker 1: Okay.  What kind of values do you hold most dear?
Speaker 2: Ah, when I was divorced [1986], my sons [Johnny M. Brown, Jr. and Joshua Brown] and my wife [Jane Mall Brown] at that time moved to California, to San Francisco.  And this was like in December.  And my sons went out and stayed.  And when they came back in May, at that time they were eight years old.  And they made the decision that they wanted to stay with me.  I valued that.  And I made the commitment to myself, not to them, not to anybody else, that--the same commitment--this is what I valued--the same commitment that my mother [Josephine Mullen-Brown] made to her children--that she was not going to marry anybody and have them come in and dictate to her children that she had by her husband [Abe Brown]; she'd rather not do that.  I made that same commitment to my sons.  I said I'm going to make this work.  Personally, I didn't think... I didn't see any way, you know.  I said, well how can I raise two children, eight years old, working the way I work and make it work?  And at that time I had a sister and a brother here, Hester and Winston.  But they, neither one of them had children, so they didn't relate to children.  You know, when you're raised in a family with twelve children, you want to get away from children.  Because the one thing my mother used to always say, "If you have grandkids, I'm not keeping them, forget it.  I'm not keeping nobody's kids, because I've raised twelve."  Okay, but that's, getting back to that, that's what I really valued.  I valued the fact that they chose to do this, and then I chose to deal with it.  And they never let me down, when it comes to that.  They-- children are children, but they didn't let me down in the sense that they had a lot of opportunities in this city.  They had, they could have stayed in California, which I couldn't understand why in the world you wouldn't want to not live in San Francisco [California] and live in Chicago [Illinois].  I just didn't, I didn't understand that comparison, you know, okay.  But then when they chose to do that, and I made the commitment to try to make it work, we did it.  But the opportunities that they had, I valued the fact that they--these opportunities that they had--to get on drugs, to do all of the wrong things, because I wasn't home a lot of times.  When I say not home, I mean it might be 7:30 or 8:00 at night.  And I did this without the help basically of anybody.  I had Mrs. Harper, who was working for me then and still helps me now.  She helped me with those children, and I value her as a treasure, because she told me this.  "Son, all you need is a good housekeeper and a good cook, and stay away from the women."  (Laughter).
Speaker 1: You took that advice.
Speaker 2: Right.  And for sixteen years now, it's been that way.  And I haven't, I haven't regretted it.  I mean at times you say well, you don't have a social life.  But I haven't regretted it.
Story_ID: 69033
Speaker 1: How has it been as a single father?
Speaker 2: Well, I think I've been, I've been okay.  I've been a nice parent as a single father.  I made it a practice not to have people around too much, I mean in terms of in and out.  I gave them that respect.  I didn't want to confuse them with the idea that I was enjoying the fact that their mother [Jane Mall Brown] and I weren't together anymore.  They were young, they were very heartbroken and hurt by the situation, as well as I, you know.  Because the first thing you think about is what you did wrong.  I mean why did it happen?  You know, because I thought we were a good couple.  I thought we were a perfect couple.  But sometimes the way you see things, other people don't.  So, but these boys, they made up for that.  And as a single parent I had, I had relationships, I had friends, you know.  I'm not saying that curtailed that, or that stopped... or became totally celibate.  I'm not saying that's the situation.  But what I am saying is that I gave them their space and I gave them their respect, because I didn't want it to be...  The same respect that my mother gave my sisters and brothers.  And she they gave them respect, not to say that she didn't have some outside life, but she didn't bring it there.  Not to say that I didn't have some outside life, but I didn't bring it in their presence; I think I did a pretty decent job about that.  And I think I did a pretty decent job in relating to my sons that because our situation didn't work--their mom and mine--that doesn't mean that your situation won't work, you know.  I didn't infiltrate them with saying, "Well, she did wrong," or this.  I didn't even get into that.  What I had them understand is that you've got to live your life, and try to make the best choice.  And when you do, I'll respect that.
Speaker 1: How old are they today?
Speaker 2: They're twenty-three now, yeah.
Speaker 1: They're in school?
Speaker 2: They graduated from college.
Speaker 1: They graduated?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.  And they're now working with me in the business, you know.
Speaker 1: What was their major?
Speaker 2: Business administration.
Speaker 1: Business administration.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's something they said they always wanted to do, you know.  I'm truly hoping that they will make, they will make the surge from the tire business to a different kind.  And the reason I say that is because of the hours, you know.  And you have to ask yourself, you know, why is it that you don't have many blacks in this business [tires and automobile repair]?  Because it's hard.  I mean all business is hard, but this is exceptionally...  Even when the boys when they came, they said, "Dad, this is... I don't know how you did it for all of these years."  And if you see this Living Legend thing that we're doing with the boys now, they made these comments, you know, that you know... how... the changes you have to go through.  And in any business you do that, but to do it without having someone help you with your kids, it's been real rough, been a real rough ride.  It took a lot of your social life away from you, you know.  But I don't, like I said, I don't regret it.  And I don't think bad of it because of the fact that it's something that I wanted to do.  It was just another challenge that I wanted, to see if it would work.  Because it's been said more often than not that black men just don't take care of their children.  And I, and I wanted to prove that, make that a gross mis-error.  You know, and I think that it can work, and it, you know, if you love what you're dealing with.  But it still has a lot to do with background, it still has to do with parents.  You know, I was raised in a family with both parents, you know.  And a lot of kids, you know, are not born, not raised with both parents, like my sons; they were raised with a single parent.  But they were never raised with a single parent with the idea or with the concept that you should hate women, you know.  You know, I didn't teach them that, that wasn't my logic.  My thing was that "I made a mistake, you know.  And it was my mistake because of something-and the reason I feel like it was my mistake was because I wasn't paying attention to what I should  have been paying attention to, and I'm becoming a slave to something that's material," you know.  And I don't think that's the way it should be.  I'm not saying it's wrong; I'm saying that we all have to do things that we have to do in the early stages, you know.  Kids now don't have to do as drastic things as we did.  They don't... like my children had the opportunity to go to college, and didn't really work.  But they came during the summer and worked in the business, you know.  But when we went to college--
Speaker 1: But there was no struggle for them.
Speaker 2: No real struggle, you know, nothing like it was, you know, when we were coming up.
Story_ID: 69034
Speaker 1: What is the Living Legends thing you were talking about?
Speaker 2: That's, you know, the Living Legend is when... for when you're passing the torch from you to your sons.  This is a, this is... [HM Robert] Bob Starks, I believe is the chairman of that organization.  Yeah, and Henry English I think is the president of that organization.  And they had the first, their first awards thing last year [2001], and this will be the second one that they're having.
Speaker 1: You were in the first group?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: We're going to interview Mr. Starks.
Speaker 2: Mr. Starks?
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Well, now, his son and my son--
Speaker 1: He's the one at UIC [University of Illinois at Chicago], right?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: The one at UIC?
Speaker 2: Right, exactly, yeah.  Yeah, because his son and my two sons, they went to Whitney Young [Whitney M. Young Magnet High School in Chicago, Illinois] together.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, they were very good friends.  So, I've been knowing Mr. Starks for a long time.
Speaker 1: So, he started the Living Legends to honor--
Speaker 2: Right, to honor those black Americans that have established a business, like the Leaks, like A.R. Leak established that business [A.R. Leak Funeral Chapels] and he passed it on to [HM] Spencer [Leak], Sr.  Now Spencer, Sr. is passing it on to Spencer, Jr.  [HM] John Stroger, who's president of the Cook County Board, whose...  [HM] Todd [Stroger], who's a State Rep now, he's his alderman.  And hopefully, he'll, you know, be what his father is.  And these are the kinds of things that this organization is all about.  Yeah, whereas [HM] Jesse [Jackson] with his son [HM Jesse Jackson, Jr.] is pass--hopefully his son is... he's listening, because obviously... you know, the position he's in.
Story_ID: 69035
Speaker 1: You're very active in civic and business organizations.  How do you do all that and work ninety-nine hours a day?
Speaker 2: Well, because I like it.  I mean I like, I was born under a situation where the Movement was the cause, you know.  And these are, these are, these are situations where I call it part of the [Civil Rights] Movement--you know, to showcase some of the people that's really been doing a hard job, and nobody knows them, you know.  I just don't, you know, I don't think all the time that nobody... the only people that are known in this town... I'm not saying that this is the case, but Oprah Winfrey and Michael Jordan shouldn't be the only people known in this town.  I mean you got people that have struggled much, much harder and got much less fame, you know.  And these people are good at what they do, this is why they're an exception.  But you have to understand that all people--like I tell my children--all people can't make that kind of money, but you can try.  And all people just don't get blown to that extent in a lifetime.  You know, sometimes it takes three or four generations of working toward this goal.  And then maybe I don't see it, but maybe you will, you know.  In the case, of like the Leaks [A.R. Leak Funeral Chapels], this is their third generation.  Obviously, Junior [Spencer Leak, Jr.] will probably reap the benefits more than the founder, you know.  But whereas in Michael's lifetime, he became what he is in his lifetime, and he's bigger than life, you know.  And, but that's something that is a God-given talent that we all are not born with.  And many times we're born with it, but we don't know it, and we never discover the realness.  It's just like in my case, my cup of tea is not being a tire entrepreneur, and I've always known that.  But in life sometimes you get--I didn't plan on the divorce situation, so I said, "Well you've got to have an income."  You know, you just can't walk away from things.  When things doesn't go your way all the time, then you have to make steps toward doing the best you can with the situation that you're put in, you know.  Had I believed that the situation that didn't occur--that did in my lifetime, I think I would be doing what I really like doing, you know.  My cup of tea is to write books and talk to people.  Not a [Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.], but something in between.  But I'm in the tire business.  So I figured, I said, well... the old cliche is, you know, if you're a good street sweeper, then sweep better than anybody else in the world.  You know, but my thing is I'm in the tire business, and this is something that I'm in, and this is something I'm going to deal with.  Now, perhaps my sons hopefully can go in another direction, and I do hope so.  But that's pretty much it.
Story_ID: 69036
Speaker 1: What do you think is your greatest accomplishment?
Speaker 2: My greatest accomplishment I don't think has been accomplished yet.  (Laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It's, you know, until I do what I really...  I know time is not on my side.  I won't live as long as I have lived, I understand that.  But you know, one of the things I accomplished that I do like is the fact that my sons are grown now; I appreciate that. I appreciate the fact of my opportunity of getting to know, and knowing people in this town that most people look up to and never imagined that they would ever be--would ever see, you know.  People like [HM] Jerry Butler, who's a personal friend of mine.  I used to... was raised up off his music, and say, "I never see this guy."  Or, in 1985 when Michael Jordan first came to town, he and I and [HM] Father Clements got awards together at what you call it, the Dress Horsemen Award, and Oprah Winfrey.  We were all at the same table at that time, you know.  And these are the things that I think is not an accomplishment, but to me it is, because it is an opportunity to meet these people--the [Dr.] Martin Luther Kings [Jr.], the H. Rap Browns--all of these people, you know, that was a part of the Movement that created--which a lot of people don't understand right now--is that if it wasn't for the guys like the H. Raps and the Stokely Carmichaels- Malcolm [X], Dr. King wouldn't have been successful.  And the reason I say that is because this is an accomplishment in my opinion--being able to be in these people's presence and to understand the fear that they created in America.  Because their concept of fear was that if you--if a person don't fear you, you can't accomplish anything.  And I'm not saying I agree with that logic, but I'm saying that was part of the logic that helped us across, that got us over.  Because anytime you can go to Oakland, California and see a guy walking around with a gun exposed and saying, "Hey, I'm not going to take this slap in the face anymore, I'm not going to turn this other cheek," then you have to say, "Well, okay this is another trend of thinking.  This is another concept, okay.  Not that that's the means to the end, but this is another concept."  And this is what I think basically the accomplishments, in my opinion, is to get my sons and other people's sons to understand the true meaning of entrepreneurship.  The true meaning is not that you go out on a daily basis and work like hell, like I've done for the last thirty-two years, and not be able to even to go the bank and get the money that you need.  But the true accomplishment is to understand...  They said things get done on the golf course more so than get done in a meeting.  And the reason for that is because the BS is out there on the golf course.  The real money ain't never been made in the meeting.  But the drugs and all these things create America and make it what it is.  Anytime that you can take $240 or $250 million that you caught one little deal coming in--this happens every day and all day.  You have to understand, this is what this country is built around.  America has changed totally in their concept of what it is.  And then they have to now understand what the concept really is.  The concept is really not going to work on a daily basis, working your butt off for years and years and never accomplishing the real goal.  You get in your automobile and you drive and see these unbelievable homes, and wonder why you don't have one.  And then you see a basketball player come up, run up and down the court for a few hours, and make all of these dollars.  And you ask yourself, "Do he really see it?  Do he really get it in his hands?"  I can remember when I was in the presence of Muhammad Ali years ago when he was the champion.  And Boudini [Drew "Boudini" Brown] came up and gave him two-thousand cash dollars in his hand.  And this man was so elated, it was unbelievable, it was incredible.  They said, "Well, why are you so happy?"  He said, "Because I don't see real money.  This is real money."  And I'm wondering, do Shaq O'Neal [Shaquille O'Neal] really see this money?  You have to ask yourself that.  If they do see this money, then why is it that when their career is over, they're over, you know?  You wonder about this.  My, what I hope to accomplish more so than have accomplished, is passing that on.  Please try to understand what America is doing, and what it is about.  Because I don't think it's all them nice things that we see.  And if it were, if it is, it wouldn't be so one-sided.  All of a sudden now, we've been pushed back a little bit more, because the Hispanics' population now is getting stronger, it's getting greater.  Our opportunity is going to pass again.  And there's no racial prejudice in me.  My question is related to one thing: why is it we don't have our share?
Story_ID: 69037
Speaker 1: [How have you been affected by the political situation, a) as an African-American, and b) as businessperson?]
Speaker 2: Okay, first let me try to put it in this perspective, the way I see it.  I think in our communities we see and act like politicians or entrepreneurs or athletes, or something of that nature that's professional.  And it is professional.  But in most communities, politicians are designed and put in their positions for business and economic reasons.  In other words you don't send a Senator to [Washington] D.C. unless he got your philosophy in mind, okay.  When Harold Washington became the mayor of Chicago [Illinois], he didn't primarily become the mayor of Chicago on his own.  One of the key people that was backing him--because his business was booming at the time--was [HM Edward] Ed Gardner, okay.  And there were, there were--there's two types of politics, okay.  Harold was the type of politician that would listen to what you had to say in the backroom.  But he was also the type of politician that was going to decide what Harold was going to do, okay.  He was not the type that was just going to be told what to do.  He would listen.  But when Harold got on TV and said, "I'm Harold," he meant that, from all of the meetings I've been involved with.  That's one type of politician.  The other type is a politician that takes his job as a profession--that rolls with the punches.  That's what real politicians are.  For an example, you take like, a person like [HM] John Stroger.  He's a real politician.  And the reason I say that is because when opposing things come about, or situations come about where you should choose the color side as opposed to the Democratic side--which has gotten him in trouble before--he chooses the Democratic side.  And he makes it clear that "I am a politician," okay.  But the majority of the time that the side that he's with is the side that we need, because he's a Democrat basically.  That's a type of politician.  Then you have the third type, in my opinion, the type that become politicians because the money backers tells them, "This is what you need to do," and "I need you in this position because we need these laws changed, we need this passed, we need this done," okay.  So, these backroom people determines what this politician is going to do for them.  And I think basically in America, that's what a politician basically should be.  And that's one of the things that we don't do.  We can't get people in position to do what we need them to do when we need them to do it.  We need politicians... politicians play a business role.  We need politicians right now to go to various institutions and say, "Hey, look, how can these people stay in business if we don't have, if they can't get access to this, or access to that," be it money or otherwise, okay.  That's, that's the role that politics play.
Story_ID: 69038
Speaker 1: When I was at 95th and Western [Chicago, Illinois], when Arthur Rubloff wanted to get rid of me, he used the means of politics--citations, violations, all of this came through City Hall, okay.  That's a means--he says--well, look, here's a man who is powerful enough so when something is in his way, he knows how to use politics to get it out of his way.  For an example, across the street from the store at Cottage [Grove], you have a large company that's coming there now, which is Target.  It's going to employ thousands of people.  But employ thousands of people doing what?  Minimum wage jobs.  You can't take care of a family off of it, okay.  Now, how does politics play?  I can't give you the one hundred percent particulars on this situation, but I am sure that my being across the street, the next time the taxes come around, it'll be a 25, 30 percent increase.  But at the same time, the Target that comes across the street have worked a deal to pay no taxes for 10, 15, 20 years.  That's how politics play a role.  And then when I decided to squawk about my increases, then they says, "Well, all of the places up and down the street, it's going to be hit the same."  But that has nothing to do with, okay.  So, this is... this is the way, this is the political role.  If I wanted to, say, put a store next door here, and I say "Now, I'm going to put forty bays in there.  I'm going to go to the bank, and you give me twenty million dollars for me to do my project, and I know it's going to be successful."  Where does the politics come in?  I got to go through zoning, I got to go--now if I got one friend that's down there that don't want this happen in his ward, it won't happen.  That's how politics play.  Well, okay, the guy over on 18th and Wabash might say, "Well, look, he's been down and he's got a little bit more clout than me coming into his area and taking some of his business, so he uses his contact, okay, and makes it difficult for me, which is what Rubloff did at 95th and Western.  That's the role the politics play.  But the minorities, in our case, in the black situations, we don't have, we don't have that base.  You got a guy like [HM] Emil Jones who is doing wonders for schools and things like that.  You know, and I commend him and pat him on the back.  But this is just, recently started happening.  It should have been happening all the time.  You know, there's nobody that we have been able to go to.  But for years and years and years... because we had no contact.  That's just like any major corporation, when they say, "Well, we'll go out and play golf together and you can get what you want," that's because one buddy is the one controlling the banks.  The other buddy is controlling the corporate.  The other buddy is controlling the insurance.  The other buddy is a politician that can say, "Okay, I'll get you here for twenty years with no tax."  That's how it's done on a golf... nothing is done really out there, but this is what happens.
Story_ID: 69039
Speaker 1: You know. And the political arena--I'll give you another example.  When Harold became mayor of Chicago, for the first time in many entrepreneurs' life, they felt like someone from the city couldn't walk into their facility and go start writing tickets.  I mean this is happening all the time, being an entrepreneur.  You just come in and write... or you got a violation for this, you have a violation for that, you have a violation for that.  You got a violation... that'll cost you thirty thousand.  When they get through with you, thirty thousand.  The EPA [Environmental Protection Agency] come in, you got a violation for this, a violation for that.  That'll cost you another forty thousand.  When you get through, you're out of business.  But for the first time, when Harold became mayor of this town, when these people approached that door, he said, "Get out, I don't want you in here.  Don't come in here."  Because you felt like you had a friend, okay.  You then, for the first time you then could go through your alderman; and he had contact with the man.  He could sit down with the [HM Eugene] Gene Sawyers and these guys.  They'd sit down with this mayor, and say "Look, we need something down here."  But not only just... I'm not talking about just in the black community, all communities get to do that.  But you know, we were so frightened under the early Daley years [Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley]--afraid to tell a guy to come in and write you up for something that don't make sense--you're afraid to tell them to get out of the store.  This is your facility, you're afraid to say "Get out of here."  But when Harold became mayor, you weren't afraid any more.  That's the difference in what I felt.  Now, I can't speak for America, but I can speak the way I felt.  It was like something that was lifted up.  I said, now for once I got a chance to speak out, to say what I really mean, and tell these people to get the hell out of here, you know.  And even the case, if you go down, you're not going to spend twenty or thirty thousand unnecessary dollars because someone wants to get the spot that you're in, okay.  Or someone... now you're leasing and then all of a sudden you make a goldmine out of the business that you're leasing, and they decide and say "I want it for myself," so when the lease is up, you got to go.  This is, this is, it's a very simple game.  And if we can't have the political arena helping us, the banks helping us, then we're just not going to make it.

Speaker 1: And it's obvious.  I sit here and named twelve or fifteen dealers that used to be... and is not anymore.  Out in the suburbs, [HM] Mel Farr, who I understand you all just interviewed.  Mel Farr had eleven dealerships, eleven dealerships.  Now he's got one, a used car lot.
Speaker 2: Really?
Speaker 1: Yes.  I don't know if this was before your situation or after.  But this is just, this is... just happened.  One... had eleven.  And I'm sure when you interviewed him, he had eleven.  Ford [Motor Company] auctioned off everything and took them back.
Speaker 2: Really?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: When was that?
Speaker 1: This happened... and I just got the article about three weeks ago.  A friend of mine that lives in Detroit [Michigan] sent me the article.
Speaker 2: What did that... when you heard that, what did that make you feel, as a business, an African-American businessman?
Speaker 1: What that does is, here again--now I read the story.  And his position is that--well, let me say Ford's position is that they are a new car dealership, and not a used car dealership.  And Mel was making the majority of his money--according to the article now, I'm only going by the article--making his, most of his money from used cars.  He had a system where if you didn't pay your car note, he had a gadget that was on the car that could stop the car, okay.  He had some accounts receivables set up where that person will have to pay their car note on a weekly basis, okay.  But his position is that most black Americans that live in Detroit or around the area or across the country live from paycheck to paycheck.  And this is the only means that he could stand to be successful in a business of that nature without creating some concepts and some ideas of his own.  And he felt like these were the measures that he had to take in order to be successful.  And Ford later on, from reading the article, Mel's position is, he's saying that they agreed with that.  But then after their problems arose, lawsuits came.  Then they took the position that this is not the way they do business.  But he felt, he said that they felt comfortable initially with this system, because that meant he could sell more cars.  So, the first thing that--well, the feeling that came over me was that, well, it's the same old thing.  I mean, that's the feeling.  I've seen these dealerships go in this city [Chicago, Illinois] to nothing.  Not only here-Atlanta [Georgia], every-- all over the country.
Story_ID: 69041
Speaker 1: So, virtually overnight, he [HM Mel Farr] lost ten dealerships?
Speaker 2: Virtually overnight.  Ford [Motor Company] came in and said we got to close them, and we're going to auction off everything.  They didn't... now, normally, from my understanding, when you let a dealership go, or decide that you're going to get out of it, they find another dealer.  But in his case, they closed them and auctioned off everything.  And he's saying that that's not the customary way that they normally do it.  I can't speak--say to you that I know this is a fact a hundred percent, but I'm saying what I read, and what I've seen.  And to go from eleven dealerships down to one in that length of time is just amazing.
Speaker 1: Did he have any financial problems in the interim...
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: ...created?
Speaker 2: From the article, when [HM] Jesse [Jackson] went to Wall Street to get funds for black entrepreneurs I'm told, and read, that he was able to get fifty-five million dollars.
Speaker 1: Farr?
Speaker 2: Farr, and a credit line from Ford.  And I understand that they called in this note.  It was like a promissory note, and Ford closed the credit line.  So, that's how he lost the dealerships overnight.
Speaker 1: Okay, and that's when they came in and got ten or eleven dealerships.
Speaker 2: That was supposed to be under the program that Jesse had endorsed to get us some money to continue to stay in various businesses, and it backfired.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, Farr had come up with this concept to help him meet this credit line responsibility?
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: But then they say they don't go along with this, because some of the--
Speaker 2: Measures that he took--
Speaker 1: --clients--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --have been belly-aching to Ford about it.
Speaker 2: So, supposedly on some of the loans for the automobiles that was made, the interest rate was like 24, 25 percent on some of these people.  This is--now I'm not saying it's a fact, but this is what the paper said.  Because the person that sent me... sent me about three different articles in three different papers that this... from Detroit [Michigan].  Because one of my customers came in and he was telling me, "You heard about Mel Farr?"  I said, "No," because he's from Detroit.  And he said, "I was up there this weekend, and he's lost all of his dealerships."  I said, "No, can't be."
Speaker 1: What period are we talking about?
Speaker 2: From 2001 until now [2002].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  It started, I think he got this loan about 2000 when, you know, when we first went to... with this Wall Street situation.  Remember when Jesse was saying, "Well, you know, we got to be able to get funds from that area from people that are, you know, that are heavy stock... who have the heavy stock."  And Ford and different corporations like that was able to allow you to have this credit line for this money.  And, you know, with him having a Ford dealership and a couple of other type of dealerships, he was able to expand big, quick.  I understand that one year Mel did something like five hundred million between all of those dealerships.
Speaker 1: And then instituted this, what they call predatory lending.
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: Instituted the predatory lending--
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: --financing.
Speaker 2: Exactly, with that plan.
Speaker 1: And then Ford said, "No, we don't go along with it."
Story_ID: 69042
Speaker 1: So as a businessman, black businessman, do you feel--do you feel exposed in all arenas?
Speaker 2: Yes, you do.  I mean it's, it's... it's a business.  You know, it's a good thing when you're booming.  What made Brown Tire in the seventies is when Curtis Mayfield did the movie, "Super Fly," okay.  From that movie, you know, you had the fancy Cadillac and the sun-roof top, diamond in the box, gangster lean, okay.  And the guys were wearing the Super Fly hairstyle.  Well, then the big wide white tires got popular.  And Goodyear made the tires for about six months, maybe a little less than a year.  And then they made a corporate decision that the tires didn't sell enough.  You know, that they would only sell in designated areas, designated communities.  So, that wasn't... their philosophy was to make a tire that sold everywhere.  So, they stopped making the tire.  And I went into Acura and I asked them would they make the tire for me.  They said, "We'll do it if you... but every order, you'd have to order at least a thousand tires a month in order to, for us to make them.  Otherwise, we can't make them."  And I took the chance, and it worked.  I mean the wire, you know, everybody was buying the wide white tires and the wide wheels.  We used to, on a given day, we'd sell four or five sets.  You know, because you're only going to buy them in sets.  You didn't come in and get one, because, you know, they all had to match.  And this, this really triggered the thing off, you know.  But then like everything else, it changed; the change came.  And when the change came, then you have to make a change.  Like now, the change is back to where the younger people that are between the ages of say 22 maybe to 30, they're buying 20 inch and 22 inch rims.  You see these pretty rims on the black-wall tires and, you know, they're changing over from the tires that come on the car and they're going to 20 and 25... I mean 22 and 25 inch tires now.  So, this trend has changed back, but now where the white-walled tire changed to a black-walled tire, you know.
Speaker 1: So, how many tires did you get stuck with when the trend changed?  Because the trend changed rather quickly.
Speaker 2: Yeah, they do; much more so now than they did then, because trends used to last longer then.  But now trends change in six months or a year.
Speaker 1: So, did you get stuck with a month's worth, two months' worth?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  You get, because the return... when you're purchasing tires, the return is not a long period of time.  So, if you don't return those tires before they become what you call "DD," which is discontinued--if those tires become discontinued they're not returnable.  So, you just, you're just stuck with them.
Speaker 1: And they were already making them especially for you.
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: What did you do with all those tires?
Speaker 2: Sold them.
Speaker 1: Did you?
Speaker 2: Yeah, they would, yeah, they were buying them.  I mean everybody wanted a wide white tire then.
Speaker 1: So, but I mean at the end of the trend--
Speaker 2: Well, when the trend came?
Speaker 1: How did you deal with, you know, disbursing... getting--
Speaker 2: Flipped them and sold them on the black-wall side.
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: Yep.  Because you know one side is black, one side is white, yeah.
Speaker 1: Oh, I see.
Speaker 2: And then you have to sell them at a real low... you know, you almost have to give most of them away, because you know, you're stuck with them.
Speaker 1: It's almost at cost.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: At least you're gonna get stuck.
Speaker 2: At least that.
Story_ID: 69043
Speaker 1: What do you want your legacy to be?  Or what do you think it will be?
Speaker 2: Well, I tell you.  Hopefully, what I really, really am looking forward to, is doing at least two, maybe five best-sellers.  Because I think I got a story to tell.  You know, I honestly truly believe that.  Because if you don't believe that, then it just doesn't happen.  And I believe, I've always--since I was a little... a little child, I believe that if you keep telling yourself something, it happens.  I know I used to pass--there was an Acorn Tire on Washington Boulevard [Chicago, Illinois] when I first came here.  And I got into this training program, and I used to drive by that store on Sundays.  I said, one day I'm going to own some of those.  And I used to drive by 95th and Western.  I said one day I'm going to own that store, you know, and it happened.  And I think, I think that truly that it's going to happen.  I want to tell the real story of what we are about.  I know most people feel like it's been told.  But I don't think, I don't think it's been really told as to what it is, especially from the economic standpoint and the entrepreneur standpoint.  I've gone to several colleges and I've spoke on it.  I think people like Kanye West do a tremendous job.  But there's still an untold portion of it, because the heavy... the heavy, heavy part of America live from economic gains.  And it's almost to the point where we used to relate more to the ministers and the pie in the sky type of thing and the Heaven situation.  But the world has become more realistic, and we're understanding more now that things ought to be done a little bit different.  And I think that if that point is not really dwelled on--not so much from... not so much from the Christianity standpoint.  Our ministers are doing wonderful; the Braziers [HM Bishop Arthur Brazier] and the Jeremiah Wrights [HM Reverend Dr. Jeremiah A. Wright], they're doing a tremendous job; they're doing a good job.  But you have to look around and see in our communities--and I don't take from them, because I love them all and I go to their churches.  But we have to just look around in our communities to see what is being built that we own?  Churches, nothing else.  Everything has to be leased or rented.  Across the street from Cottage Grove, everything is coming over there.  We don't own it.  Our people are going to go over there and get employed with these nickel and dime jobs, but that's not the answer.  That's not the answer.  I mean, because Shaq [Shaquielle O'Neal] makes forty million dollars a year, that's not the answer.  Who is he employing?  Who is Michael [Jordan] employing?  I'm talking about employment here.  I'm talking about goals, employment goals.  How many people--with all of this money that Oprah [Winfrey] makes--and I'm not against that--I mean how many people are they really employing?  I don't mean Target comes over there and gives you two thousand jobs and pay you $5.99 an hour.  I mean, that's not our answer.  Or, we go and get a McDonald franchise and pay minimum wage to our people.  That's not the answer. You know, that's not, that's not the answer at all.
Story_ID: 69044
Speaker 1: And when we are, when we become entrepreneurs, we always get the bottom of the totem pole.  And when I say that, I'm saying that instead of becoming--instead of being the guy that have the McDonald's, we're the guy that run them; that's how it works.  And you can't even get into that program unless you're willing to go in and work the hours.  You know, and nothing is wrong with that, but I'm saying there has to be a better job.  There has to be a better way than that.  I mean, these things have to start changing.  And yes, politicians have to help you make a change.  But we can't make a change, because we can't get economically strong enough to demand that these people do their jobs.  People have a tendency to forget that these politicians work for you, you don't work for them.  But you know, they can walk into your establishment and make you feel like you work for them.  That's not the way it's supposed to be.  I should be able to walk down to City Hall and go in the office down there and make them afraid of me, you know.  This is the way... it's in the wrong direction.  You know, and these directions have to be changed.  You know, we can't just continue to become a [HM] John Johnson, and then all of a sudden sell it off.  And ain't nothing wrong with that, because he paid his dues.  But I'm saying somebody should have to be strong enough to say, "Okay, well, if you don't want it then I'll take it."  You know, this is what I'm saying, you know, and this is what's not happening.  This is what's getting worse.  This is why, you know, we're going in the other direction, you know.  And I think we'd get more respect from everybody if things would change.  You know, I don't think... I think we would stop being looked down on so much and thinking we're not equal, you know, if things was really changed economically.  You know, and this is why I think I have a message to tell. Because I've been in this arena for thirty-two years, and I really know--I really can truly tell any audience and not bite my tongue, that you are not going to get rich being an entrepreneur.  We've always thought so, but I'm telling you it's a lie, and it ain't going to happen.  It's going to happen for a short period of time.  You're going to become the [HM Edward] Gardners, and it's going to get away from you.  You're going to become the [George] Johnsons and it's going to get away from you.  You're going to become [HM Albert] Al Johnson, the first tire... the first [black] automobile dealer in America, and it's going to get away from you.  And you're not going to be able to pass it on to your children like everything else gets passed on.  Something's wrong with that.  Don't you think something's wrong with that?  Something is wrong with that.  And I think is the message that has to be told, you know, rather than...  And [HM] Jesse [Jackson] does a good job of getting around, but he can't be the protector forever.  I mean when I got a problem, I don't think I should have to run to him and say he's my leader.  I mean, I'm my own leader.  You know, just open the door, like James Brown said, I'll get it myself.  All I want is the opportunity to knock, and I want to be in a position to get it myself, you know--not rather than say, well every time I feel like I've been mistreated that I got to go to him and say, "Look, I've been mistreated.  I need your help to get me out of this jam," you know.  I mean politicians, that's their job.  You know, when you get mistreated you go down there... go to City Hall and change things, or go to Washington and let's make a change.  That's the position that should be taken.  And this is the position that I take in America--that not so much has to do with tire business, but I welcome the fact that I've been in this business for thirty-two years, and I welcome the fact being... it taught me a lot.  And I understand now, I really and truly understand now that this is not the way, because you cannot keep it.  And until we make these changes, you can have all the Johnny M. Browns and Ed Gardners and the John Johnsons in the world, and it ain't going to change nothing.  When these people get ready to take Bronzeville [Chicago, Illinois] and everywhere else back, ain't nothing you can do but sit and look.  You can make the pennies and the peanuts, and they walk away with the gold.  And that's a fact, and no offense to anybody.  But I know; I've done this for thirty-two years and I know it ain't there.  You just... because... two reasons.  The first reason being that it's a game that's being played in America and it's not a good game.  The second reason being, ain't no way in the world you're going to keep loyalty around you that long, because they're not going to stay around you until you grow to where you need to be.  So, you start regressing, you start becoming smaller than you once were.  And you're telling yourself all the time that it's going to be, things are going to change... it's going to get better.  It ain't going to get better.  It's, the only way it gets better is you make it better.  And you cannot make it better standing out there working eighteen hours a day like I do-
Story_ID: 69045
Speaker 1: But anyway, continue your thought.  You were saying we won't get rich being entrepreneurs.
Speaker 2: Well, it's just like when we're employed, we live from paycheck to paycheck.  I mean, that's just the way that is.   You know, you can't, you can't...  You used to be able to save maybe twenty-five percent of your income.  But now things are, things are--let's look at it this way.  When I was going to college right here in Chicago [Chicago State University in Illinois], my apartment was three hundred and fifty, maybe four hundred dollars a month.  My, right now my sons' little apartment is like twelve hundred dollars a month.  They just got out of college, you know.  Automobiles, when we were growing up, the first two or three cars I had was a little Ford, a little cheap Ford, you know.  So, the transportation, it gets you from point A to point B, because you were trying to do something.  Your goal was beyond that.  Now, a kid just 22 or 23 years old, the problem that parents have, like myself, is trying to keep them low-keyed.  They want to drive the, not the BMW, not a 321I, they want to drive a 500-SL or 600.  I mean, a 22 year old, 23 year old.  So, what that do, what that does to a parent, it keeps you living above your means most of the time.  So as a result, you can't, there's no room for saving.  The only difference between a corporate America brother that is making perhaps two hundred thousand dollars a year and the guy that's making forty thousand dollars a year, is a paycheck.  It's no real difference.  And I'll tell you why.  Because the home basically is a mortgage.  Even when he get to the point where he needs to--here again I'm back to the old song--borrow... he can't.  So, you take a home that you perhaps bought for five hundred thousand dollars, and you got maybe a hundred and fifty thousand dollars' worth of equity in it.  And you go back to the bank and you use that equity in that home.  So now, you got two notes rather than one.  You've made another step beyond where you're supposed to be.  You've got a son here that's twenty years old, "Well, Dad, I don't want to drive a Ford.  I want a BMW, I want a Mercedes Benz, I want a Lexus."  So he whines enough, and you make... you go and you do that.  So, what is the difference between that guy and the guy at the bottom of the totem pole?  We're all living from paycheck to paycheck.  Now, an entrepreneur that owns a small business, like myself for example, you're putting in these hours.  Most of us lose our wives, because we're pushing too much, too long, can't enjoy... never takes vacations.  If you do, you panic.  You're calling back every ten minutes.  If you don't, you burn out, you're evil.  And when you do, you go two or three days, and you're right back to it again.  And the hours that you work, all you're doing is creating ideas to put out there to the public; you pay for that.  Once you get it out, then they come in; you sell a product you had to buy, so the profit margin is not there.  The cost of living is crazy.  So, what are you doing?  You're living from month to month.  Is there a real difference?  It's not a real difference.  We can't get beyond that, and this is what creates a problem. Even if things bloomed in many cases for us, it's still a problem.
Story_ID: 69046
Speaker 1: The major entrepreneurs, just like, say with Bob Johnson [Robert L. Johnson, founder of Black Entertainment Television].  Now, he had his reason for letting it go.  We all have our reasons for doing things.  But many of us look at it and say, "why would he do that, you know?"  Because he's burned out, he's tired, he's worn out.  And somebody comes and offers him a goldmine, and he takes it, you know, and give him a position rather than the headache that he had in running the company.  On a small business scale, you have to be everything.  You have to make sure the accounting is done properly, make sure that the attorney is doing you right; make sure that the taxes are paid.  Every, all companies do this.  But basically, I'm saying in small business you have to make sure of these things yourself.  So, the grind, everyday grind on you--and this is why I made the comment that it's not true either way.  You know, becoming a real entrepreneur would be the way.  But for whatever reasons, we just don't ever make it to that point.  And many times when we do, we're so worn out, we're so burned out until we just don't last once we get to that point.  And that's what the situation is, unless we're in--we migrate to Hollywood and do like many of the Eddie Murphys or the guys like that.  But even in their line of work, look at the people that have paid the dues for these people to become what they are.  And you can ask them, "Do you know this guy?" And they say, "I don't know him."  Like, tears almost came to my eyes one day when I was looking at TV.  And Curt Flood, I don't know if you remember Curt Flood... the commitment that he made--
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: --and what he went through to get baseball to what it is.  And he asked a baseball player, "Do you know Curt Flood?" ... a baseball player.  He said, "No, who is Curt Flood?"  A professional baseball player.  Curt Flood is only the guy that made it possible for you to make the money you make.  He's the guy that made it possible for you to go to one team to another by your own choice.  But you know, what's my point?  Now, my point is that we need to know who do these things.  We need to understand the price that people pay for us to get where we are.  And when the guys changed their whole program and went to Hollywood, like the Eddie Murphys and the guys of that nature, well, he has to understand that you had artists that was there that paid their dues that didn't get that kind of money, especially in the singing world--the dues that Little Richard and James Brown and all of these guys paid.  And people are still making songs and money off their royalties, and they're not getting any cut from it.  But the guys like Michael Jackson and all these guys come along and buy up all of these rights.  Now all of the singers now, the young hip-hops, they're becoming producers rather than singers.  Because they realize that the singers ended up going broke, and the producers walk away with the funds.  So, this is what I mean when we say our perspective has to be changed.  And this won't, this is a change that's not made overnight, but this is a change that has to be imbedded into young individuals, so when they come along, it's there.  You know, it has to be imbedded.
Story_ID: 69047
Speaker 1: For an example, to give you a typical example--there wouldn't be in America today--now you think about this.  There would not be in America today any racial prejudice at all if the parents was teaching their children that it doesn't exist.  It wouldn't be, wouldn't be no prejudice; wouldn't be no color situation.  It wouldn't be any of those things.  But if the game is good, you don't change it.  The game is good.  I mean, I'm accustomed to--when I say I...  See, most people that are in position, they're accustomed to having all of this money.  They're accustomed, so they're not going to pass it on.  You're crazy if you think so.  You've got to go and take it.  You're not going to get it freely passed on.  You know, and if anybody tells you, "Well, I don't understand... that there is no racial prejudice," they're crazy.  It is, and always will be, because the game is being taught the same.  Why is it that you can go right over here to the University of Chicago [in Hyde Park, Chicago, Illinois] and you got one percent of the people over there is black?  You mean to tell me we ain't smart?  We're not smart enough?  You can't even get the money to go.  It doesn't mean we're dumb, it just means that the game's going to stay the same unless you make it, unless you make a change.  It's not going to change.  I mean you can walk--I've lived in Hyde Park [Chicago, Illinois] all my life, married to a Caucasian at that point.  And these people, you walk up to them, they still act like they're prejudiced, like you're crazy, you're out of your mind.  I mean why is that?  Because you're taught that way.  You still are being taught that white is right.  You're still being taught that.  And if you weren't, you wouldn't act like that.  You would act like all men are created equal.  And that's the answer.  I know people get tired of hearing it, and I don't even like to talk about it--I don't on an everyday basis.  But when I get the opportunity, I'm going to share my train of thinking, hoping that somebody will listen and will hear it and understand more, because I understand the politics in the world.  I understand entrepreneurship.  And more than anything else, I understand the cause.  I understand that, because I lived in it and I lived with it.  And I know what it means to be second-class, and I understand that, you know.  And I know what it means for people to think they have more than they have, and got a little bit more than the next person.  I understand it; we're all living from paycheck to paycheck, I can relate to that.  I understand that an entrepreneur on our side of the fence ain't a real entrepreneur.  On the other side of the fence, the Enron people and people of that nature, it's a game.  Ain't no way in the world the president's son can go down and take two or three billion dollars from a bank and make taxpayers pay for it.  If we could do that, we would all would be alright.  But we can't do it.  [HM] Jesse Jackson's half-brother [Noah Robinson] decided that he wanted to tell the world that he had a ton of money and live in Mexico, and he been in jail ever since.  Now, I don't know whether his charges with the El Rukns was thumped up or not.  But I know that people have means and ways of getting rid of you when they don't want you around, I know that.  I know Malcolm [X] is not in his grave because he told a lie, he's in his grave because he told the truth.  I know [Dr.] Martin Luther King [X] is not dead because he told a lie, he's dead because he told the truth.  And it's simple as that.
Story_ID: 69048
Speaker 1: So, the books you want to write, are they fiction, non-fiction, or both?
Speaker 2: Both, both.  Non-fiction, because I got a story to tell; fiction because I think people got a story that they need to know about, and not necessarily about my situation.  Autobiographies is good because, you know, you got at least five or six books that you can talk about there--from whence you came, from where you're going, and what you are about--or anything else, you know.  I know people, they've always heard and talked about hardship and things of that nature.  But I'm talking about hardship in a different light.

Speaker 1: And the fun side of you, what do you do for fun?
Speaker 2: Well, I don't have a lot of fun--I mean what you would call fun.  But you know, believe it or not, I get fun out of--the best fun I had in my life was when I was teaching school [at Burnside High School], because I thought I was reaching children.  You know, that was fun to me--not fun in the sense of a game, but fun in the sense of fun, okay.  Because you know, I like that.  The second level of fun that I enjoyed was when my kids was in Little League, and I used to go to the game.  And you enjoy that.  Fun like going to Cancun [Mexico] or something like that, well, that's--I use that as, not as a fun thing, but as a relaxing thing, you know.  I don't want to do nothing, you know.  And that's one of the, one of the appreciative things that I can do being single.  Because when you're not, then you got to think of the other person, and you say well, they might not want to do this.  But nothing used to bug me more than going on that type of a vacation and then they want to shop for rings and for this...  (Laughter).  That's not me, you know.  But now I enjoy, I call that fun.  So that's fun, that's fun to me, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, is there anything I didn't ask you that I should have?
Speaker 2: I think we pretty much covered everything.  (Laughter).

Speaker 1: Can you tell us about this first photo?
Speaker 2: Ah, that's in the back lawn of my mother's [Josephine Mullen-Brown] home in Demopolis, Alabama.  The guy on the left is my brother, George.  The one directly behind my mom is Winston.  He's the baby of the family.  And that's my sister, Hester, she's on the right.  She's the one that worked, started off on day one in the business, with the business with me.  But she's, since now she's retired and moved back to Alabama.
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And that's my mom in the middle.  That's the first year that she got sick, yeah.  That's when we realized--I should say we realized she was sick.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: This photo is, that was my class of 1961 from U.S. Jones High School which is in Demopolis, Alabama.  And that was our 30th anniversary.  Yeah, that picture was taken in 1991, thirty years later.  And we, you can see the size of the class size.  That's me on the very left.  And this was not the entire class, but it was some of the class members that was there.  You see most of them was girls, because I think girls was dominant in our class at that particular year.  In '91' [1991], no, I take that back-- that was '81' [1981].  That was the 20th year anniversary... that was 1981.  We graduated in '61' [1961].  That was the 20th year.  We had one in '91' [1991], but that's not the photo.
Speaker 1: Okay, next.
Speaker 2: That photo was taken in 1973.  We were living in Hyde Park at the time.  That's Jane, that is my ex-wife.  And the son in the middle is Johnny, Jr. and the one on the very end is Joshua.  They have, we all have the same initials--Jane Mall Brown, Johnny M. Brown, Johnny M. Brown who is Johnny Marcus Brown, and Joshua M. Brown.  And my grandmother also had, her name was Jane M. Brown.  So, it's kind of like a tradition that we held on to, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's me of course, Johnny M. Brown, and that was the year I graduated [from U.S. Jones High School], 1961.  And by the way, that cap and gown is my best friend's cap and gown.  Because I left, we left in a hurry to get the photos taken, and I left mine at home.  (Laughter).  So I had to wait until he took his, then I used his cap and gown and took mine.  (Laughter).  And the cap and gown by the way belonged Milton Young, the first guy that you saw in the class reunion photo.  We were best buddies.
Speaker 1: Next.
Speaker 2: That photo came from an article in what we call the Go Magazine that Goodyear [Tire and Rubber Company] published.  That is when I opened the store at 9539 South Western in Evergreen Plaza [Chicago, Illinois], and they did an article on the entrepreneurship.
Speaker 1: What year was that?
Speaker 2: That was in 1974.  And we stayed, we stayed there from 1974 up until 1986 before I leased it out.
Speaker 1: Okay, ready.
Speaker 2: On that photo that's, that was a meeting we had with the current mayor [of Chicago] at that time, which was Harold Washington.  And the gentleman that he's facing is [HM] Mr. Dempsey Travis.  And the other gentleman that's to the left of Mr. Travis is one of his security people.  And we were, as you could see, with the mayor; we were having a good time.  He got caught with a cocktail in his hand.  (Laughter).  He preferred to call it lime juice.  (Laughter).
Speaker 1: That's 1984?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, ready.
Speaker 2: On this photo that's, the gentleman to the left-- this was an organization that Don Johnson [sic, HM Donald J. Jackson] had become a part of, and it was for the high school basketball youth.  As you know, Don was originally from the west side, and he was, he went to Marshall [High School], yep.
Speaker 1: Don Jackson.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Don Jackson, from... what is the name of his company?  Inner City...
Speaker 1: Central City.
Speaker 2: Central City Productions, okay.  And the gentleman to the left is Mr. Cox, who's a longtime coach for King High School, and the winningest coach in Chicago, by the way.  And of course that's Don in the middle, and that's me to the far right.
Speaker 1: Okay, what year?
Speaker 2: Mr. Cox retired since then, yeah.
Speaker 1: Who are they?
Speaker 2: Myself and [HM] Reverend Willie Barrow.  And this was a function at the Urban League which we both attended.  As you can see, she had a nice head of, full of hair then, and (Laughter) and a gorgeous leather outfit.  And it was an enjoyable evening.  I believe that was in, that had to be 90... I can't remember the exact year on that.
Speaker 1: Okay, ready.
Speaker 2: That was the same... that was also at the Mayor [Harold] Washington luncheon.  And that's [HM] Mr. [Dempsey] Travis on the left. That's the same year, about 1984.  And that's one of the organizers in the middle, and of course that's me to the right.  I forget the gentleman's name in the middle.
Speaker 1: Okay, tell us about this one.
Speaker 2: In this photo, everybody was pretty young.  (Laughter).  On the left--as a matter of fact--that, and this function [the Dress Horseman Awards], that was in 1985.  I believe it was the second year of Michael [Jordan].  It was either the first year or the second year.  But he had a cast on at the table then.  And we, we, the three of us got awards.  And Oprah [Winfrey] is sitting to, at the very next table, she didn't get on the photo.  And I can remember her saying that night why when Michael walked in, everybody stood up and gave him an ovation.  When Oprah walked in at that time, she got a light one.  And she was asking Michael why is it that he was getting... more people there was basically endorsing him than her.  So, Michael at that time was more popular than Oprah.  But they're both very, very popular people now.  And that's [HM] Father [George] Clements on the end.
Speaker 1: Okay, tell us about this.
Speaker 2: That photo was, is... it was a birthday... a welcoming home party for the boys, my sons, after their first year of college.  And they were coming back home then, so I gave them a gathering.  And of course, that's me on the end.  In the middle is Aretha, who is Reverend [Ralph] Abernathy's niece.  And that's my brother, Winston [Brown], on the right.  That's, they're husband and wife.
Speaker 1: Okay, tell us about this one.
Speaker 2: On this particular photo, of course, that's me on the left.  The gentleman on the right, his name is Dred Arrington.  He was a principal here in the public schools of Chicago.  And he's from my hometown, Demopolis, Alabama.  He was coming from a very, very prominent family there.  His sister now that lives in California had just written a best-seller book.  She just had her book autographing about two weeks ago.  And the gentleman in the middle is [HM] Dempsey Travis.  He was there for the boys' homecoming because he's their godfather.
Speaker 1: Next.
Speaker 2: The, that is in Dayton, Ohio.  I was receiving an award along with Mayor Dinkins [sic, Mayor James H. McGee] of Dayton, Ohio at the time.  That was in, that had to be in 19--about 1979.  It taken place at one of the downtown hotels there.  And we were, he was just telling me about the city of Dayton, because that was my first time ever being there.
Speaker 1: Alright, next.
Speaker 2: That is a young John Day, who was part of that ceremony.  He was, he was on the program at well.  And I believe that that's--I had--one of the first times I had met John, because John at that time was from Dayton, he's from  Dayton.  And he was down there at the time.  And he heard I was going to be there, so he came out to the program as well.  So, I had quite an enjoyable time.  The young lady there, she's emceeing the program.
Speaker 1: Alright.
Speaker 2: That photo is taken at that gathering.  The gentleman on the end is Willie Hicks, who was given an award.  He was the vice president of Dollars and Sense Magazine.  Since that time, Willie has deceased.  And the gentleman next to him is myself.  That gentleman that's next, I can't remember his name.  The third gentleman from the left, he's one of the, he had two dealerships in Dayton, and he had done quite well at that time.  The next gentleman of course is the mayor [James H. McGee].  And then John Day is next.  And the gentleman on the end was the president of--what's the black college?  Wilberforce [University in Ohio].  Art, I forget Art's last name.  But he was a very, very popular guy in that area.   That's the president of Wilberforce again, Johnny M. Brown, Willie Hicks and John Day.  John is telling us all about Dayton.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That is, I happen to be in the company of two nice ladies.  That's Muriel Duster on the left.  That was at one of the Black Creativity dinners.  And on the right is Wilma Sutton.  They both are with Northeastern University.  That was taken in...;
Speaker 1: Here again this is back to the mayor [Harold Washington] whom most people loved, and I know I did, because he was a very astute gentleman, very good with words, and you just enjoyed his company;
Speaker 2: That is two of my very good friends, and they came out to welcome the boys back at the same time.  That is, on the left--I know most of you all probably--if you're not familiar with him, you're familiar with his music.  That's [HM] Chuck Barksdale of the Dells, and on the right is none other than the 'Iceman' himself, [HM] Jerry Butler.  So, we were just having fun.  That's in the basement of my home;
Speaker 1: That is, that photo is from my sons' graduation.  I was a proud dad then, I was so glad they made it.  And not that they gave me any problems, but I was just happy, I was happy for them.  That's Johnny on the left and Joshua on the right.  They graduated from Whitney Young [Magnet High School in Chicago, Illinois].  They went the first two years to Mount Carmel, and they kept whining about they wanted to go to a co-ed school.  So, they talked me out of leaving Mount Carmel and going to Whitney Young in 1996.  (Laughter);
Speaker 2: This is at one of the affairs, I believe it was Dress Horsemen back in 1980--no, 1981.  And that is Vera Collins on the left, the wife of the late Harvey Collins.  We all lived... we were all good friends; we all lived in the same building.  And that is one of her friends on the right.  And that was, we had a real enjoyable time.  Vera helped me--now that's the other person that helped me raise my sons.  She would take them to swimming and things of that nature, and she was very, very instrumental in helping me raise my boys.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: This was at the Black Presidents Award, and it was in '99' [1999] I believe.  And that's [HM] Mrs. [Margaret] Burroughs from DuSable Museum in the middle.  And that's Stan Williams, who's a prominent attorney here in Chicago now.  Stan and I were college classmates.  We graduated from college together, and he went on to be a very successful attorney;
Speaker 1: That's at the Black Presidents Awards sponsored by General Motors.  I was making a thank-you speech.  That was in 1999;
Speaker 2: That was at the Black Expo Presidents Award where I was thanking everybody again for giving me a special award.
Speaker 1: Alright, next.
Speaker 2: That one was at the, one of the Creativities.  That was, that's John Day and myself.  John and I go way back from a long, long time when he started.  He's, he's done okay in that business.  You know, he's in TV, you know, from Channel 25, you know.
