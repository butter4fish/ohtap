 Finchum Today is April 11, 2016. My name is Tanya Finchum. I   m with Oklahoma State University. Today I am in Woodward, the city, in Woodward County, to interview Bruce Benbroke? Did I say that right?  Benbrook No, Benbrook.  Finchum Benbrook.  Benbrook Bruce Benbrook.  Finchum Let   s say it again  To interview Bruce Benbrook, and this is part of our Cowboy in Every County project. Thank you for having me today.  Benbrook Glad you   re here.  Finchum Let   s learn a little bit about you, beginning with when and where you were born.  Benbrook I was born November 24, 1953 in Woodward, Oklahoma. Except for four years at Oklahoma State University and a year in Oklahoma City, I   ve lived here my entire life.  Finchum What did you parents do for a living?  Benbrook I am a third generation banker. My father worked in this bank. I followed in him and my grandfather   s, so I   m a third generation banker here in Woodward.  Finchum We should say what that bank is.  Benbrook The bank is the Stock Exchange Bank in Woodward. We   ve been in business in Northwest Oklahoma since 1903. I   ve been here since 1977. Almost all my business career has been here in Woodward, as chairman and president of the Stock Exchange Bank. 5  Finchum You grew up in town or on a farm?  Benbrook I grew up here in town, here in Woodward. Graduated from Woodward High School in 1972 and Oklahoma State University with a B.S. degree in Finance in 1976  Finchum Did you have brothers and sisters?  Benbrook I had one sister. She was four years older than I am. She graduated from Oklahoma State University four years ahead of me, sure did.  Finchum Did you all have a choice of where to go?  Benbrook You know, I grew up   my father was a graduate of Oklahoma A M, at the time, a few years before. I grew up as a small child going to events with him. I remember, as a four or five-year-old, going with him as he served this area on the OSU Alumni Board of Directors. I grew up with orange blood. I really didn   t have a choice, didn   t want a choice. Oklahoma State University was where I wanted to go. My mother said that the kindergarten teacher one time asked her after class, how come I brought up one day at kindergarten that I wanted to know where everybody was going to college. I had already made my decision. I didn   t waiver from that. From age four or five on, I was going to Oklahoma State University. I haven   t regretted it one bit.  Finchum In high school, what was your favorite subject?  Benbrook My favorite subject in high school would have probably been history. I enjoyed learning about the history of our area and the history of our state.  Finchum Not math?  Benbrook It was not math. At that time, I really hadn   t taken that many business courses. When I got to Oklahoma State University, I certainly focused on, my major was finance, so I focused on more business courses in Oklahoma State. Certainly in college, it would have been business. All my courses that I took in business were my favorites at that time.  Finchum Well, in high school, did you play sports?  Benbrook I did. I played for three years on the Woodward High School boy   s basketball team. I thoroughly enjoyed that. I was hoping that I would be good enough to play at the college level, but I was not. (Laughs) I went on to other things, I devoted all my time and energy to Oklahoma State. I was involved in numerous things on campus, but making the basketball team certainly wasn   t in the cards, for numerous reasons. The main one was, I 6  wasn   t good enough. (Laughs) I spent a lot of time and a lot of other activities on campus and was quite involved. I thoroughly enjoyed every minute that I spent at Oklahoma State University.  Finchum Well, in high school, were you FFA or 4-H?  Benbrook No. I was president of the senior class. I was very involved with that. I spent a lot of my time with athletics and basketball. I learned leadership roles and was active in Student Council and all the other things like that. I was president of the senior class, and I developed that urge for student leadership and kept that going at Oklahoma State as I was involved in numerous activities and programs there.  Finchum When you weren   t studying in high school, what were you doing for fun?  Benbrook Mainly, I spent a lot of my time, literally, playing basketball. It was what I thoroughly enjoyed doing. I worked on it year round hoping I was going to be good enough to play at the next level. I was not, and I realized that quite, certainly, early on. Then I also was involved in several other philanthropic activities and charity work, and carried that on over into leadership positions at Oklahoma State.  Finchum What was your first job?  Benbrook My first job I worked literally all summers, through my high school years and after my freshman year of college, at a boy   s camp in Arkansas at a little town called Mount Ida, Arkansas, near Hot Springs. It was a sports camp, and I was a counselor there, and I worked all summer. I would work for two months, all summer long. Then, following my freshman year at Oklahoma State, I worked in the College of Business Administration building. I worked for Dean John Bale and Dean Walter Starks in the College of Business. I went to work there following those time frames, one summer. It gave me good experiences.  Finchum When you got your first paycheck, your first money in your hands, do you remember what that might have been?  Benbrook That was exciting, to know you had actually earned it. At the boy   s camp in Arkansas, they paid us at the end of summer, so it seemed like a lot of money. It probably wasn   t in the grand scheme of things, but to have that check, to bring home from Arkansas, to put in my bank account here in Woodward was kind of a good feeling, after spending most of the summer doing that.  Finchum You had a bank account that early?  7  Benbrook I did. I did, certainly, to put the money in. Being the son and grandson of a banker, you just kind of learn to do that.  Finchum When you went to OSU, did you have a similar    how did you do your finances there, just same way back and forth?  Benbrook Same way, back and forth. Kept things back here, but certainly people in Stillwater were real good to work with you. This was before the advent of ATMs and online banking, and all that. You had to go to Student Union or the grocery store to get a check cashed, or whatever. The people in Stillwater were always good to work with us.  Finchum Did they put you on a budget?  Benbrook That   s right. We had to kind of be careful about that, your expenses. I had certainly tried and I got a scholarship, too, for one of the positions I held on campus, and did some things like that. That was helpful.  Finchum Where did you live when you got there?  Benbrook I lived four years at the Sigma Nu fraternity at 913 University, on the corner. I lived there all four years. I had a wonderful experience there. The leadership training and the relationships that I had there were simply fantastic. Enjoyed every minute of those four years I spent living in the Sigma Nu fraternity house.  Finchum How often would you come back to Woodward?  Benbrook Not very often. I was extremely involved on campus. Literally was active and had many events on the weekends that I needed to attend. My parents would come see me on football game weekends and stuff like that. We would make that work. I was extremely involved on campus. I didn   t come home very often. They came to events that I had, but I was extremely involved on campus, and I just had activities going on the weekends a lot. I was very busy. I spent most of my four years right there in Stillwater.  Finchum Did you have transportation?  Benbrook Did have a car, I did. I absolutely had a car. I didn   t, literally, travel all that much because most of my time was spent in Stillwater. That   s for sure.  Finchum Who would do your laundry?  Benbrook I remember it very well. At that time Married Student Housing, which was over on the north side of campus, had a situation that if you brought your laundry, and I had a laundry basket. If you brought your laundry all together, 8  took it to them, for fifty cents over and above the cost of the washer and the dryers   they would literally take it from the washer, take it from the dryer, fold it for you, and put it back in there. You   d come back four or five hours later and it   d all be done. Best money I spent my entire four years of college. It was wonderful.  Some people working their way through school, I don   t know what that would translate into dollars forty years later, but back then it was a wonderful deal. We   d just take it over there and leave it. They had a laundromat over there in Married Student Housing. I   d drop it off. I just remember over and above the cost of the washer, the dryer, you   d give them fifty cents extra, and they would take it out and put it away. I would go study, or whatever I was doing with my time, and then go back four hours later, and it   d be ready. Great investment. One of the few things I probably did right in my college career was take advantage of that. (Laughs)  Finchum Well, did you spend any time in the Library?  Benbrook I did. Not as much as I probably should have. I think the OSU Library is absolutely wonderful. I know my freshman and sophomore year I spent a great deal of time. I lived really close, a three minute walk from where I lived, right at the edge of campus. I would walk over to the Library a great deal of time and study. I spent a lot of time over there, on research and studying, and thought it was great. I had an office in the Student Union my junior and senior year, and I spent a lot of time over there. I   d go to the Library a lot to study, just to get away and to make sure that I could concentrate on what I was doing. I thought the OSU Library forty-two years ago was wonderful, and it   s great today. We are so fortunate to have such an outstanding facility. I   m just so honored that we have such a great library as we do.  Finchum You were there when they had the big card catalog as you came up the second floor     Benbrook Oh yeah, you had to figure out all that. Pull the drawers out and do the bibliography thing and all that. I remember that well. The microfiche and you   d have to go and put it under the little scanner and all that. My two daughters would laugh at me now if I tried to explain how that worked. They just sit there on their telephone and do all the things that took me thirty minutes to figure out how to do. Yeah, it was a different environment, but a wonderful facility. It   s just such a landmark for our institution.  Finchum At your time, they would have had the bowling alley in the bottom     Benbrook Bowling alley in the basement, absolutely, in the Student Union. Absolutely, it was in the basement. Wonderful, interesting. Of course, the Student Union 9  as it is today, is such a wonderful place  At that time, too, as it is today. With all the improvements over the years it   s just a tremendous asset to Oklahoma State University, not just to the current students, but to those of us that are alums. It   s just a focal point to have a wonderful student union. I   ve not been in one better.  Finchum Would you go to dances there?  Benbrook No, we didn   t. I think they had them occasionally, but I don   t believe that I ever attended one there at the Union.  Finchum I   m assuming you attended basketball games.  Benbrook Absolutely  I love all the sporting events, certainly. That was always a great experience, and that was always tremendous, to go with friends to enjoy the college athletics. It was exciting, that   s for sure.  Finchum And Homecoming?  Benbrook Homecoming was just as   had a lot of fond memories of all the hours, just as the students do now, of spending time with Homecoming and learning to pomp and do all that good stuff. I joke that I   m sure that has been a valuable asset in my business career, learning how to pomp for hours upon hours. I remember staying up all night Homecoming week, trying to get the floats ready and the house decorations, but it was just a good experience. I thoroughly enjoyed being a part of Homecoming. I was active in that for four years. It was just a wonderful thing.  I think Oklahoma State University has the best Homecoming in the entire country. We are so fortunate that the students still are willing and supportive of the program, and to see all the people that come back and enjoy the time and the effort that our students put in to make it what it is. I know we are maybe biased, but truly I think it   s outstanding. Outstanding in every respect. I don   t know of a better Homecoming in this country than Oklahoma State University   s.  Finchum Did your fraternity ever win any of the awards?  Benbrook I don   t think we ever win anything. I don   t remember that. We tried. Probably not as hard as we should have. We participated. I don   t ever remember winning anything. We had a great experience, and it was always a lot of fun. It was great to be a part of such an outstanding tradition at Oklahoma State.  Finchum Did you have a favorite professor?  10  Benbrook I had several favorite professors, I would hate to just pick out one, several professors at Oklahoma State University. I think the thing that was so important to me was that they cared about each individual. It was more than just the textbooks and the lectures, but they cared. They wanted you to succeed. I had several people that were advisers to me over the years, and professors. I remember one in particular that was an adviser I didn   t have. He was adviser to Blue Key and some of the other organizations I was involved in. His name was Dr. B. Curtis Hamm. He had been there for many, many years. One of those people that literally   would have some of us out to his house and was concerned about how we were doing, how things were going. People like that, that   s what makes Oklahoma State University what it is today. Our professors and our administrators care about the students. I had numerous professors, if I start naming one or two, I will probably get in trouble. Dr. Hamm was an adviser, but I had numerous people that were just outstanding and so supportive. Dr. Bale, Dr. Starks, I worked for one summer. They were the administration of the College of Business. Wonderful people, just absolutely wonderful. Cared about the students, always put the student first.  Finchum Did you have a class that challenged you?  Benbrook You know, I think one of the classes that probably challenged me would have been some of the accounting classes that were difficult for me. I managed somehow to get through them. I don   t know how exactly, but I did. It worked out. I was able to get my degree in finance. Some of the accounting classes were a challenge, but in a very positive way. Forced me to work hard, and try to keep up, and learn the basics of accounting.  Finchum Did you struggle with deciding on a major?  Benbrook I did. I didn   t declare a major until my first semester of my junior year. At that time, the first sixty hours were pretty basic. I think to some degree, that   s still the case. It was first semester of my junior year. That   s when I decided, at that point and time, I might want to come home and work in the family business, so to speak. Certainly did that later on, and I decided that finance was going to be my major, and business. Haven   t regretted it one bit.  Finchum Well, you mentioned you were in other organizations on campus, do you want to go through those?  Benbrook I guess my biggest experience I was fortunate enough to be president of the Student Body. I was president of what they call the Student Government Association (SGA) now, and that was kind of a job. It really was a job. I spent a great, I don   t know, twenty, thirty, forty hours a week sometimes in that position, representing the students. Of course, you had to run for that office, but I was fortunate enough to be elected. I did a lot of things in that 11  positon representing the students. Dr. Kamm was our president. I represented the student body, at the Board of Regents meetings for instance, and did several things in that position that just took a lot of time. I thoroughly enjoyed it. The leadership training I got from being in that position has been helpful to me my entire career.  I was involved in Interfraternity Council. I was involved in Blue Key. I was involved in numerous other organizations on campus. Prior to being elected to the president of Student Body, I was in the Student Senate. A lot of those organizations kind of helped me as I prepared to be president of what they call now the SGA. It was a great experience, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I was involved in numerous organizations that kind of prepared me for that.  Once I became president of the SGA my junior and senior year, that kept me plenty busy. I was representing the students at numerous things. We were in the process of having the bicentennial there in the    75,    76, and I was president and representing the students in a lot of that, our country   s bicentennial. We worked with a lot of people to sort of make the students a part of that. It was just a real great experience for me. I had a wonderful experience.  Finchum You were there in the early    70s?  Benbrook Seventy-two through seventy-six.  Finchum Vietnam War was going on     Benbrook Right. It was winding down. That is one experience I will remember vividly. We were all gathered in the basement of my fraternity house the night they did the last lottery, if you will, to pick the names of the people that would still be eligible for the draft. We had one TV back then, in the basement of where we all lived. We gathered around the television. They literally took the ping pong balls out, three hundred and sixty-five of them. They pulled out your birthdate to determine where you would be, as far as becoming draft eligible. At that time they decided, I believe, it was the first fifty would be eligible. My number came up three hundred or something, so I was not. Several of the people that I was friends with went and enrolled in ROTC quickly, because their numbers were fifty or less. Then, the next year the war started winding down, and they didn   t have to go. They were prepared, certainly, at that time to do that. I remember that vividly. We were all gathered around, because our lives were going to be impacted. If your number, your birthdate was drawn, then there was a good possibility that you might   ve gone and represented our country in Vietnam. It wound down about that time.  Finchum Was there much activity on campus surrounding that? 12  Benbrook You know, there was not. I think there was several campuses around the country    at that time, by the time I got to Stillwater and Oklahoma State, it was starting to wind down. I mean, the war was kind of slowing down. I do know that night a lot of us were concerned. What is this going to mean to our future? What is this going to mean immediately? At that point in time, it started winding down. I would say, compared to many college campuses on the east and west coasts, it was relatively calm.  Finchum Well, I   m assuming you dated while you were there. What are some of the places you might go for dates?  Benbrook Back in those days, the Hideaway Pizza was still the popular place, if you can believe that, after all these years. There were a lot of things that   the parties and things were held at fraternity houses and things. Now, I don   t think they do that. There weren   t many places outside the campus that things were held. The Hideaway was a tradition back then. Eskimo Joes had not started yet. It was in the process of getting started. The Hideaway was a place that was still very popular back then.  Finchum What about for movies?  Benbrook I   m trying to remember. I don   t think movies were a big thing. I   m trying to remember even, I take that back. The movie theatre up on the corner, on Campus Corner was right there. Right where the Hideaway has expanded into now, the movie theatre was right there on the corner. I was pretty busy. I didn   t go to a lot of   I really missed out on a lot of that, especially my junior/senior year and was busy with the SGA thing. I went to a lot of meetings and a lot of other type of events. A lot of that I missed out on.  Finchum Didn   t get to sleep much.  Benbrook No, I kept busy, that   s for sure. I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of it.  Finchum What do you remember about Stillwater?  Benbrook I just remember Stillwater as such a wonderful community. To this day   and I   m fortunate to have had a daughter that graduated three years ago, and I have a daughter that   s a junior at OSU now, so I get the last few years and at least for two more years, I get to spend a lot of time over there. I   m just amazed at the quality of the community and how supportive it has always been to Oklahoma State University. Such a tremendous town and gown relationship. I love Stillwater. I just think it is one of the greatest college towns in the country. I just think they are so supportive, and OSU and the City of Stillwater make a tremendous relationship. The students benefit. The 13  community benefits. It   s just a win-win situation for everybody when you have that close-knit town and gown relationship.  Finchum Well, did your two daughters have a choice of where they went?  Benbrook They would probably tell you no, but they both have had   my oldest daughter graduated three years ago. And my youngest one, like I said, is a junior there right now. They   ve both had tremendous times at Oklahoma State University and haven   t regretted it one bit. I   m sure they would both tell you   they started attending events in Stillwater when they were small children, before they were five years old, and I think they would probably tell you that they were probably pushed that way. Probably more than I would want to admit. Truthfully they   ve both have great experiences over there.  Finchum What are their majors?  Benbrook Well, my oldest daughter, Rachel, graduated three years ago with a degree in strategic communications. She went overseas to get a master   s degree at Leeds University in England in political communications. My youngest daughter, Julia, is in strategic communications. She   s in media journalism and majoring in the TV and broadcasting side of it. My oldest daughter, Rachel, focuses on the print side. My youngest daughter is majoring in the TV and broadcasting side. Rachel and Julia are both been in the School of Journalism and thoroughly enjoyed the opportunities and the professors and all the great things that that school has provided for them.  Finchum They won   t be coming back to the family business?  Benbrook I don   t know, at this point and time I don   t know. Neither one of them has shown an interest in the business college at this point in time. They both have found their niche. They   ve been pleased that they have taken that path, I think.  Finchum Well, how has Woodward changed in your forty years of being     Benbrook It   s been a tremendous change. We sit in the middle of the oil and gas industry. Certainly when I   the population since I graduated from high school has more than doubled. The school system, of course, has grown exponentially. The community has, literally, continued to grow and prosper in so many ways. It   s just sitting in the middle of the oil and gas reserves, and all the activity and all the energy companies that have come into play as we have seen this activity grow in the last forty years. It has just become a very good-sized community, and doubled in size and population since I graduated from high school.  14  Finchum And wind seems to     Benbrook Wind energy has been a tremendous plus for our area. From where I sit, there   s probably three hundred turbines within thirty miles. I probably would be guessing, and there   s more planned ahead. We   ve been fortunate that we have a lot of wind in northwest Oklahoma, and the wind energy companies have certainly been a very positive help to our community and our school systems out here. We hope the wind continues to blow because it has certainly been a positive for our area.  Finchum I drove through town and there was a movie theatre and what looks like an opera house, and then the Carnegie library.  Benbrook Right.  Finchum It   s been really busy at some point.  Benbrook A lot of positive things going on, a lot of positive things in our community, in the arts, and certainly our school system has expanded. We built a brand new conference center, just recently, in the last three years. We now have a branch campus of Northwestern Oklahoma State University at Alva here that in the last ten years has really grown and prospered with a brand new facility. We   ve got a new six-screen movie theatre out on the edge of town. For a town our size, it   s just fantastic. Numerous restaurants, motels, the community has just grown and prospered. Our school facilities have all been updated in the last few years, because of our growth and prosperity, so it   s been good. Woodward is just a great community, and I   ve been extremely fortunate to grow up here and certainly, raise my family here.  Finchum When you were growing up, was there a movie house?  Benbrook Yes, right.  Finchum A skating rink?  Benbrook Skating rink, and the movie theatre, and people dragging Main Street. That was the popular thing, to drive up and down Main Street to see your friends. Now, as you know, the entertainment options are so great, so many things, that dynamic has changed a little bit. Woodward is big enough to have everything you need, but also small enough to have a small town feel. You feel like you know everybody. When the community has a project or things happen, everybody rallies around and supports each other. It   s a very positive thing.  Finchum You  dragged  Main Street?  15  Benbrook Absolutely. That was the in thing to do. You   d go around the Sonic Drive-in. That was the thing to do. You parked there, see all your friends. That   s where you would see them, up and down Main Street.  Finchum Sonics were around back in that day?  Benbrook Absolutely  Woodward had one of the very first Sonic   s in the entire state of Oklahoma. It   s extremely popular and still is to this day.  Finchum Was it called Sonic?  Benbrook It was called Sonic. Originally it was called Top Hat. Then it changed its name to Sonic. Then, the chain has taken off, certainly. We had one of the few Dairy Queens in all the state of Oklahoma. It   s extremely popular, right on Main Street. People go to the Dairy Queen, people go to the Sonic. So it was a good experience.  Finchum Did you have to help on a farm any while you were growing up?  Benbrook No, I did not, I did not. I grew up here in town and so I spent a lot of time. My summers I spent literally working in camps out of state, and that was a good experience.  Finchum Can you describe the house you grew up in?  Benbrook Grew up in a wonderful neighborhood, small town and people. Literally, my elementary school was almost out the back door. It was a block over. Just go out the back door of the house, just a small community and everybody knew each other. You just walked to school right out the back door. It was just wonderful.  Finchum Lunch at school or lunch back home?  Benbrook Lunch at school. Yeah, lunch at school back then. Had lunch at school all the time. That was great.  Finchum You graduated from OSU in    76?  Benbrook Uh-huh.  Finchum Where was the ceremony?  Benbrook At that time, we all graduated together at that time at Lewis Stadium, the football stadium. We all went across. I was in the College of Business. If you were in the College of Business, or College of Arts and Sciences, all the various colleges they had back then, they had just one ceremony, and so it 16  was quite a to-do  It was a lot of people, the crowds, as you can imagine. Now we have numerous ceremonies, you know, but back then, it was all one ceremony and everybody was there together. It was wonderful.  Finchum Your parents came up here?  Benbrook Certainly, it was a very great day  Then, you try to figure out the next day, what am I going to do next? (Laughs) I love Stillwater. I love my time at Oklahoma State University. If I could have stayed, dadgumit, I got my degree  I should have figured out a way to stay longer.  Finchum Get a master   s      Benbrook I should have done that, yes. I went to work for the First National Bank and Trust Company of Oklahoma City, which was at that time the largest bank in the state of Oklahoma. They had a kind of training program for college graduates to learn about banking. I was just there thirteen months, and I called my father and said,    I   m ready to come home.    He was excited, I think. I was fortunate enough to work for him for three years before he passed away. I became chairman and president of the bank here at age twenty-eight. I had to grow up in a hurry. It was a busy time for me after that.  Finchum Twenty-eight?  Benbrook Uh-huh.  Finchum What was his name? Your father?  Benbrook Temple Benbrook, and he graduated from A M in 1936.  Finchum Temple, that   s an interesting name.  Benbrook That   s interesting. That   s his name. That   s my middle name. His name was G. Temple Benbrook. He graduated from Oklahoma A M, at that time, graduated in 1936. Met my mother during the war up in Kentucky, and she was a graduate of Indiana University, and they moved down here.  Finchum In Kentucky?  Benbrook Well, he was stationed in World War II at Camp Campbell, Kentucky. My mother was from Indiana. His best friend in the Army, his wife would become my aunt, brought my mother down, and they met there in Kentucky, and they got married in Indiana and came back. She went to school, grew up in Indiana, graduated from Indiana University and moved down here. That   s kind of how that all worked out. 17  Finchum Moved to Woodward.  Benbrook Moved to Woodward, America  Back then, the move from Indiana to Oklahoma was quite a leap of faith, I think, in numerous ways. (Laughs) Anyway, that   s how that worked. He graduated in 1936 from A M.  Finchum Then, you forty years later, in    76?  Benbrook I guess that   s right, forty years later. That   s right, that   s exactly right. I think he was forty years old when I was born. That   s right.  Finchum One of the daughters needs to graduate this year so that it will be forty more.  Benbrook I   ve got one that will graduate in    17, I guess, it will be. She will graduate next year. She   s on track to graduate in May of    17.  Finchum If it was sixteen, it would be forty     Benbrook That is right  I hadn   t thought about that.  Finchum That is the extent of my math today.  Benbrook Yeah, that   s going to get bumpy in a hurry. That   s for sure.  Finchum Well, what was your favorite spot on campus?  Benbrook I probably would say the Student Union. Just because I spent so much time there. When I was involved with the SGA, I had an office there. I spent a lot of activities there in the Student Union theatre, and there were just all kinds of things that happened there, and I spent a lot of time there. I thoroughly enjoyed my time there. It was great. It was just a great opportunity. So many meetings were held there and so many activities were held there that I got to know a lot of people, lifelong friends that I made in that building that are still close friends to this day, that I met in that facility. And, certainly, I enjoyed the time in my fraternity and the lifelong friends that I made there. Those two places I spent the majority of my time the four years I was there. I had great experiences both places.  Finchum When you go back now, is there a particular place you like to walk through or visit?  Benbrook Truthfully, I was up on campus last weekend for a Mortar Board initiation for my daughter, and I got there early. I walked through the Student Union. Just had a great time, seeing all the construction, seeing all the new 18  additions they   re making to it. It   s still a focal point for me. Certainly, in the last few years, we have, I say the last few years, several years ago, they added the new Alumni Center, and that   s a great place to go to, to meet fellow alums and people you went to school with. Between those two buildings right there on campus, it   s wonderful. The Union, of course, has a dear spot in my heart for many reasons and continues to, to this day.  Finchum You started to work here when you were twenty-eight?  Benbrook No, I started earlier than that. I became chairman when my father passed away, when I was twenty-eight. I started here in 1977. I would have been twenty-four.  Finchum Pretty young too  What point did you get back involved with OSU?  Benbrook You know I   ve been involved with the Oklahoma State University since I graduated. I   ve been involved in numerous respects, and I thoroughly enjoyed the opportunity to serve. I first went on as a board member of the OSU Alumni Association. I served a couple terms on the Friends of the Library, which you   d appreciate, did that. Served on the advisory board to the Posse Club, the athletic arm, did that over time. I was fortunate enough to be elected to serve as national president of the OSU Alumni Association. I thoroughly enjoyed that time. Then served three or four terms on the OSU Foundation Board of Governors. I currently serve on the Board of Governors, OSU Foundation. Following my time as national president of the OSU Alumni Association, I served a term on the OSU Board of Regents, the OSU A M Board of Regents. I was fortunate enough in    94 or    95 to be chairman of the Board of Regents. That was just a real positive experience and a great way to give back to the University that had done so much for me.  I   ve been involved in numerous other alumni activities over the years. The last few years, I   ve served as adviser to the leadership programs, the committee on the leadership programs that the University provides for students. I   ve just served on a lot of different capacities over the years. OSU is just an extended part of our family. The people, the institution, the leadership, the administration, have just been fantastic to our family, and we thoroughly enjoy it in numerous ways. Anytime I get an opportunity to serve or give back, I take advantage of it.  Finchum That   s a question that we   ve been asking, too. Why are people so loyal to OSU? What is it?  Benbrook I don   t think there   s any question. Certainly, we love the buildings, we love the community, we love the facilities, but more importantly than all that   that   s great and they   re fantastic, but the people, the people of Oklahoma 19  State University are special. The people care about each other, the students, the faculty, the administration, the alumni, we   re all part of a family. I think it   s unique. I think it   s unique among a lot of institutions throughout this country that Oklahoma State University is family. The Benbrook family, I don   t know how many  on my side of the  family   my sister graduated from Oklahoma State, my dad did, my brother-in-law,  and many other relatives as well . My wife   s side of the family,  she did so  they probably have  at least six  graduates of Oklahoma State University. It   s family to us. It   s something that is so important. I   d have to sit down and literally count all the members of my family and my wife   s family that are OSU graduates. It   s many, and it   s become part of our family.  As far as my immediate family is concerned, we consider it part of our extended family, Oklahoma State University. We thoroughly enjoy the institution, we enjoy the people. That   s what makes it special. It   s made it special for me since I was three years old and went to my first football game with my father. OSU has been a special place to me and my family. It will continue to be for my kids and I   m sure my grandkids too. That place is special. It   s because of the people and the relationship you build for years to come. It   s meant the world to me and my family.  Finchum You must have a lot of the orange at your house.  Benbrook Lots of orange  Yeah  (Laughs) Have to be careful about that. (Laughs) I didn   t have a problem finding an orange tie this morning, let me put it that way. I did not have a problem finding one. We   ve just had a great experience. It   s been fun   Finchum Pistol Pete, do you remember any interactions with?  Benbrook Absolutely  I knew the Pistol Petes every year when I was in school. I   ve been fortunate that I know both the Pistol Petes this year, because my daughter   s involved on campus. We go to the games and get to know Pistol Pete. It   s such a tremendous mascot and represents Oklahoma State University. Absolutely, I   ve known the Pistol Petes back when I was in school. I know the Pistol Petes now. They are tremendous representatives for the University. When they take their hat off, when you get to know them, they   re just wonderful gentleman. They do a great job. Pistol Pete is just something that   s very special.  Finchum What advice would you give current students, or future?  Benbrook The current students and future students, take advantage of the opportunities that Oklahoma State University provides you. There are so many opportunities that you can avail yourself of outside the classroom. Certainly, you need to pick your major. Make sure it   s something you   re interested in. 20  Make sure it   s something you feel like is going to help you in your career after you graduate and move down the road.  At the same time, I think one of the things that makes Oklahoma State University unique is all the opportunities they provide you. Whether it   s socially, professionally, athletically, there are just so many things that you can do outside the classroom that are going to help you in your career. It   s going to help you develop relationships, going to help you develop all kinds of friendships. It   s going to help you develop confidence. It   s going to help you in so many ways. OSU has hundred of organizations. There are numerous committees, numerous ways to get involved on campus. If you   re an incoming freshman, I encourage you when you come on campus, after you figure out where the classes are and you figure out how much you are going to have study, take advantage of those opportunities. You will never regret, you will never regret taking advantage of those opportunities that Oklahoma State University provides you outside the classroom. It will benefit you so many ways in your future career.  Finchum That   s a good sales pitch. (Laughter)  Benbrook Absolutely. I could, if President Hargis needs another salesman over there, I could do it in a heartbeat. It   d be from the heart, I can assure you.  Finchum Can you sing the song, do you know all the words?  Benbrook Not very well. At the end of each game, when you   re supposed to stand, I struggle. I can   t sing anything, but I try to. Truthfully, I probably have to lip sync a lot. I think the people sitting next to me,    This guy may know the words but he can   t sing.    We   re usually there at the end of each game, when the opportunity presents itself.  Finchum Well, when you were traveling back and forth, you didn   t come home much, but which way would you go?  Benbrook Most of the time, from here, we go through Seiling, Canton, Okeene, Hennessey, Stillwater. That   s the route that I made over the last fifty years, well, not fifty years, probably forty-five years. I   ve made it numerous, numerous times. I can kind of drive that in my sleep. Sometimes I probably did. That   s not a good idea, but anyway, I   ve made it numerous times.  Finchum That   s the quickest way?  Benbrook The quickest way to get between here and Stillwater.  Finchum Well, are you recruiting OSU students here?  21  Benbrook Absolutely. We always have opportunities to spread the good word. I visited with a young lady just recently that decided to go to Oklahoma State and come by and visited with me. Anytime I get the opportunity to talk about the positive things that Oklahoma State University can offer her, she even became more excited about it. She decided to attend Oklahoma State University.  I always am willing to spend anytime with our high school students that have questions about the universities. Even if they don   t end up at Oklahoma State University, I think it   s so important to encourage them to try to attain that college degree. Yes, I have friends that I visited with and encouraged that have gone to OU and other institutions. The most important thing is to encourage them to go get that college degree. I try to shade them a little bit orange, but sometimes that doesn   t always work. Again, the most important thing again is that they go ahead and get that college degree.  Finchum I   m sure there are some OU fans around.  Benbrook Absolutely, absolutely. We give each other a hard time, certainly during the athletic contests and all that. That   s part of the deal.  Finchum Most people who know you in town know that you are an OSU alum?  Benbrook Absolutely, absolutely. (Laughs) There   s no question about that, no question about that. Because of my involvement over the years in various capacities, and having my wife a graduate of OSU and having one daughter already graduated, and one that will graduate next year, I think people are well aware.  Finchum Did you meet your wife at OSU?  Benbrook No, we grew up together here in Woodward. Grew up together here in Woodward. She graduated and got her undergraduate from Oklahoma State University and got her law degree from the University of Oklahoma.  Finchum House divided a little   Benbrook There you go, there you go. Especially during the athletic contests, we don   t let her talk about that OU connection but anyway. (Laughs)  Finchum OSU doesn   t have law, so     Benbrook That   s the way she rationalizes it that   s for sure. (Laughs)  Finchum Well, did she follow you to OSU?  22  Benbrook No, I think she probably made that decision on her own. I think she probably decided on her own to do that. I think she   s glad she did that and then got her law degree at OU. Neither one of our daughters, at this point in time, has picked banking or law as a career. We   ll just see what happens. (Laughs)  Finchum Any plans to retire at anytime soon?  Benbrook Don   t have any plans to retire anytime soon. Enjoy what I   m doing and enjoy the community. Enjoy being here, that   s for sure.  Finchum I   m still curious about Temple? Where did they get that name?  Benbrook I was told there was an old country lawyer here named Temple Houston many years ago that was a famous attorney here in Woodward. Supposedly that   s where the name came from for my father. Then, that became my middle name.  Finchum I wonder if he was related to Sam Houston.  Benbrook Yeah, there you go, that   s right. There you go. They   re all related, that   s for sure.  Finchum Woodward is an interesting town, I think. It   s an easy drive now. With 412 it   s easy to get here.  Benbrook Right. It is, 412. They   ve done a lot of work, and that   s really been helpful to us.  Finchum Wind is the thing right now, huh?  Benbrook That   s been very positive. Of course, we sit right in the middle of   we   re fortunate that we have the wind energy, and certainly we sit right in the middle of the oil and gas reserves. A lot of companies headquartered in Woodward work, say out in the panhandle of Texas or panhandle of Oklahoma, southern Kansas. We   ve been fortunate to kind of be in the center of things. That has helped our community grow and prosper. In the past few years, the wind programs have come into play. We   ve been very fortunate to benefit from both. Certainly our agriculture background is still there, and certainly a base. Between the agriculture, oil and gas, and wind, we kind of have a diversified economy, if you will.  Finchum I noticed the grain elevators, you   ve got several.  Benbrook Oh certainly.  Finchum Different generations. 23  Benbrook Different generations, and cattle and wheat are our two major agriculture areas.  Finchum Is water an issue out here?  Benbrook Always, always. We always need more rain. We   ve had a lot of dry weather and had a lot of fires recently. Just in this past week we   ve had some very serious fires out here because of lack of moisture. That   ll always be an issue. Just has been for many years. I imagine we   ll be dealing with that for many more years.  Finchum OSU can   t help with that too much, but I   m not sure.  Benbrook I don   t know. We   ll take any help we can get.  Finchum Cloud seed.  Benbrook Over the years, that   s even been tried, certainly.  Finchum Really?  Benbrook Oh, it has  It has. Anything, anything to help. (Laughs)  Finchum Your favorite, fondest memory of OSU, and then we   ll close. One or two if you can   t think of one.  Benbrook My favorite memory of Oklahoma State University would be the people. The friendships that I   ve made, the relationships that I   ve made, not just in my four years at Oklahoma State University when I was actually a student, but throughout the years, the involvement I   ve had with Oklahoma State University, the people have just been wonderful. That, if I had to say my most, I have so many positive memories from my time in school. I literally could go on an hour detailing all the great experiences I had as a student. Over the past forty-five years, the people at Oklahoma State University, the current students, the alums, the friends, the administrators, have simply been fantastic. The people at Oklahoma State University are the best. There   s just no question, they   re the best. My fondest memory of all the years I   ve been involved in Oklahoma State University is the people.  Finchum You have been through several presidents...  Benbrook Absolutely.  Finchum In your length of service and time there     24  Benbrook I   ve been fortunate to know most of them, some better than others, but the majority of them I   ve gotten to know on a personal level. We   ve been fortunate, and leadership is so important in higher education right now. We are just extremely lucky to have President Hargis and Ann Hargis leading our institution right now. He   s a visionary, he cares about the future of Oklahoma State University, and he steps forward to make projects happen. I   m so excited about the new performing arts center. They just announced last week more progress on that, and that   s going to happen. His leadership makes it happen. To raise over a billion dollars for the future of our institution, it   s simply phenomenal. And Ann Hargis, she is just a wonderful first lady. We are so fortunate to have her. The students just think she   s wonderful. I do too. We   re so fortunate to have Burns and Ann Hargis leading our institution. I know our future is bright under their leadership.  Finchum I think we are fortunate to have you as a fan too   Benbrook (Laughs) Well, I don   t know about that. I certainly would qualify as a supporter, because I do love Oklahoma State University and everything about it. It   s just an extended part of our family.  Finchum Well, I appreciate you sharing your stories with us today.  Benbrook Thank you so much for having me. I look forward to seeing the finished product. I know, with all the stories of all the people that love Oklahoma State University around the state, it   ll be a great story to tell.  Finchum I haven   t heard too much negative  Or any negative really, so     Benbrook You will not hear anything negative from me. It   ll be 100 percent positive, and that   s from the heart. Oklahoma State University   s just, for my family, they just mean the world for me. Means the world to me.  Finchum We   ll close with saying   Go Pokes   Benbrook Go Pokes  (Laughs)  -------  -------
