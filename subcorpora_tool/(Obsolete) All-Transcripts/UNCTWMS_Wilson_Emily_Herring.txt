Elizabeth Lundeen: Today is August 6, 2012 and this is Liz Lundeen of the Southern Oral History Program here with Emily Wilson in Winston-Salem, and we&#8217;re going to be talking about lots of stuff, starting with your early life, but can I get you to just say a little bit about where you&#8217;re from and what life was like growing up? I think I read that you&#8217;re from Columbus, Georgia.  Emily Herring Wilson: Yes. I&#8217;m Emily Herring Wilson, Herring, my maiden name, Wilson, my married name. I&#8217;m from Columbus, Georgia. I was born in 1939, one of two daughters of Sarah and Clyde Herring. We lived in the house of my grandmother and she lived with her almost blind sister, and it really was my first introduction, I think, to women&#8217;s history because there were so many school teachers and widows who lived on the block in downtown Columbus and they came to see my family.  EL: Is there a particular interaction that you remember in your formative stages, being struck by all these teachers and women?  EHW: Well my mother was a teacher and I went across the street on 4th Ave. to an old downtown school for six grades, and all the teachers were single, and of course it was a white, segregated school, and the principal was Jewish and quite intellectual. We had a very impressive Jewish community in Columbus and she was out of that community. On the other side of the block was the black school. I don&#8217;t think in those days I thought in those terms but that&#8217;s the way it was. We lived in the old house on the avenue that had been built in the late 1800s by my great-grandfather, who was a Quaker. On the alleys intersecting the avenues there were small shacks really, where black families lived. So I lived at the intersection of 4th Ave. and Zions Alley. That made an impression on me too. Occasionally some black people&#8211;we called them &#8220;colored&#8221; then&#8211;worked in our home. We didn&#8217;t have a regular housekeeper or maid. A man we called Mr. Athan came and put in light bulbs for my grandmother and a woman we called Mary used to come and get the washing and take them back to her house where she boiled them in a pot, and I used to go down there and sit on the steps and watch her. So that was dominant.   We had very good public schools. Most of the children who went where I went were mill children. My mother came home late in the afternoon because she always had to make home visits. But there were a few children of so-called professional families. The editor of the fine newspaper lived close by and his children went there. But for the most part it was a neighborhood of old people in which the suburbs had already leached out most of the vibrancy of the neighborhood.   EL: Did religion play a prominent role in your family growing up?  EHW: No, not really. My grandmother was a Christian Scientist and Miss Lottie Barnes was a practitioner who used to come and talk with her when my grandmother was upset. I guess now she&#8217;d be called a counselor. So I had very friendly feelings towards Christian Science, which is always regarded as a very odd religion. I knew that my great-grandfather had been a Quaker and I was very interested in the peace advocacy of the Quakers, which I knew just a little about. My mother was a confirmed Episcopalian but not church going. We went to the Baptist church vacation bible school. My parents never had a vacation and didn&#8217;t have a car and we couldn&#8217;t go to camp but we did go to the vacation bible school at the Baptist church. It was wonderful, so good in fact that my sister and I joined that church. But there wasn&#8217;t much discussion of Christ. We were well aware that we lived among all of these people&#8211;I&#8217;ve mentioned Christian Science, Jew, Episcopalian, Quaker&#8211;and in our mind there was not any difference among any of those.  EL: And was there an expectation&#8211;? I mean it sounds like education was important. You and your sister were obviously both in the public schools. Was there an expectation that you would go to college?  EHW: Yes, and I think at that point there weren&#8217;t really private schools. There was a Catholic private school where Catholics went, some of them. Everybody was in the public school and it&#8217;s one of the disappointments of my life that in this town, for example, there are private schools whose campuses look like small colleges. It has certainly eroded some of the support for public education. But my sister was a public school teacher&#8211;I mean my mother. She had gone to the woman&#8217;s college of Georgia. It was called Georgia State College for Women. Her older sister, Catherine, was a high school teacher, Catherine Allen, and she did not marry. She went on to get a PhD and to have a career in higher education. My mother&#8217;s sister, Marjorie, married and had children. She was a teacher. I have done teaching. My sister taught in the public schools of Columbus, Georgia.   There was an expectation we would go to college but it had to be carefully worked out because there wasn&#8217;t much money. I was a candidate to be a journalism scholar at the University of Georgia but I didn&#8217;t want to go there. I wanted to leave Georgia for reasons I had not yet even understood. So I went to the Woman&#8217;s College of the University of North Carolina &#8211; your school &#8211; at UNC-G, at some hardship to my parents, I think. Even though it cost about eight hundred dollars a year it was still a lot for them. But we certainly knew we would go to college and our cousins went to college, so it was an educated family. My daddy came from a different place. His father worked in the mill in the Chattahoochee Valley. His mother had dropped out of school to marry when she was about fifteen. He had not gone to college but he had a lot of respect for educated women.  EL: So how did you know about the Woman&#8217;s College in Greensboro?  EHW: Well my Aunt Catherine was very prominent in physical education and Woman&#8217;s College had a prominent physical education program, so she knew about it, but I also applied to Chapel Hill because I was interested in journalism. They told me that at that point women could not come to Chapel Hill until their junior year, this was the pattern at other schools, and they told me about Woman&#8217;s College. It sounded like the school my mother had gone to and so a high school friend and I applied, and we went there and never even considered transferring because just from the get-go it was just my oyster. I loved it.  EL: So you wanted to study journalism in the beginning. Did that change quickly? Did you continue to pursue a major in English and writing?  EHW: I majored in English. I really pursued student activities. I was active in every aspect of student life and was president of the student government when I was a senior and was the commencement speaker for our graduation. As far as I was concerned that was the end-all and be-all of my college experience, but I did major in English and I studied poetry with Randall Jarrell. At that point it was very unclear to me what I wanted to do and I graduated with very few plans and I had to do something quickly because there was just no money for me to lay out. I found out that there was a small graduate program in English starting up at Wake Forest, which I had only known vaguely, and I applied and got a small scholarship. Well, like most people, you don&#8217;t have a careful plan; you just follow the open doors. I studied more than I did in undergraduate. And I loved to teach, I loved to stand up and talk&#8211;I&#8217;d learned that in student government&#8211;and when I graduated they asked me to teach at Wake Forest for a couple of years and I did. I liked it but it was clearly not something that was my passion.   But I did make a great life out of it because I married a man who was a bachelor dean here in English, a great liberal, and we had three children and we have made our home on the Wake Forest campus. I had a rather spoiled life. Even though I worked all the time it was [as a] volunteer and then as now people don&#8217;t put much credence in volunteer activities. But I worked in a lot of women&#8217;s organizations, a lot of activities at Wake Forest. I always wrote. But I think that if I were now a young person I certainly would pick up that dream of being a journalist because I think today some of the best jobs for women are in journalism. I worked for the newspaper. I wrote editorials during the years of school desegregation.  EL: Here in Winston-Salem.  EHW: I did, at the Winston-Salem Journal. I wrote laudatory articles about busing, which aroused the ire of many critics. I didn&#8217;t have children in school so I suppose it was theoretical, and it was hard for me to get the truth of how parents felt about it because nobody was talking, so I wrote about what a success story busing was. Well that didn&#8217;t go over very well with the blowback from people who read my articles. I had little children and it was more than I could manage, and I stopped writing for the newspaper and started teaching poetry in the schools and publishing whenever I could &#8211; poetry, stories, and essays for magazines.  EL: What was the kind of blowback? I mean did people write editorials back to the editor or did they contact you personally?  EHW: No. It was an unsigned editorial so they just wrote and said whoever wrote this editorial doesn&#8217;t know what he&#8217;s talking about because school desegregation isn&#8217;t working well. I realized that when I had gone around and interviewed people in schools that the teachers and the principals had been told that I was coming and they had a very scripted plan to say everything was fine, and I was not a seasoned journalist, I was only a homemaker. In college I had come out as a liberal from a conservative background and I was really craving to find a liberal position that I might work on. I had not worked on the civil rights sit-ins in Greensboro, though I was there. Our chancellor ordered us to stay on the campus but we could have resisted that. Some of the young women, particularly the black women who were students at Woman&#8217;s College, did go down, but most of us took it as a good excuse. We did other things that didn&#8217;t amount to much. We discussed it in legislature and passed bills of support. So by the time I was in charge of my own life more or less I did want to do something that showed some support for the cause, so as often as I could when I wrote editorials I tried to write about progress made.  EL: You said that you came out as a liberal in college from a conservative background. Can you talk a little bit more about that transition, what your family might have believed that you realized you felt differently when you were in college?  EHW: Well for one thing I had the advantage of education that they hadn&#8217;t had. I had gone outside the state. My father operated a trailer park. He had driven a bread truck in the segregated South and he had been very poor. So I don&#8217;t give myself any credit for having insight that made me a liberal. I had opportunity, and Greensboro, Woman&#8217;s College, was a very liberal place. It had a great liberal dean named Harriet Elliott who worked in the FDR [Franklin Delano Roosevelt] administration. She&#8217;d been succeeded by the great Katherine Taylor, who was our dean of women. Active in student government, I always was mentored by Katherine Taylor. We had a mock election on our campus. The candidates were Richard Nixon and John Kennedy. We watched the Kennedy-Nixon debates and all cheered for Kennedy, and I could vote because I was eighteen and you could vote in Georgia. Dean Taylor said, &#8220;Who are you going to vote for,&#8221; and I said, &#8220;Well I would like to vote for Mr. Kennedy,&#8221; and she said, &#8220;And will you?&#8221; and I said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know.&#8221; She said, &#8220;Why?&#8221; and I said, &#8220;Well, my grandmother said that if you vote for a Catholic the Vatican will run the country,&#8221; and she said, &#8220;Do you believe that?&#8221; She was leading the witness, and I said, &#8220;No, ma&#8217;am, I don&#8217;t believe that.&#8221;  EL: [Laughs]  EHW: She said, &#8220;Then you can vote for Mr. Kennedy.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Well, he&#8217;s a liberal. My daddy says he&#8217;s a liberal.&#8221; She said, &#8220;And so are you.&#8221; I said, &#8220;I&#8217;m a liberal?&#8221; She said, &#8220;Yes, you are,&#8221; and from that day on I took up that identity and wanted to be a liberal, called myself a liberal. It didn&#8217;t set well with my parents but I had married a liberal and I had my own life and I think that was the turning point, in college. Would that have happened in Athens, Georgia at the University of Georgia, where they were also desegregating and where there were certainly people in support of the first [African American student], which was Charlayne Hunter, who went to the University of Georgia? I don&#8217;t know. A lot of it depends on your own perspective, how free you feel. I didn&#8217;t feel free in Georgia and I did feel free in North Carolina. Then of course I discovered the great liberal tradition of Chapel Hill with Frank Porter Graham.  EL: So did you read about Chapel Hill? Did you travel to Chapel Hill?  EHW: Went to Chapel Hill a lot. I was a member of the President&#8217;s Council of State Schools. In 1960, after the sit-ins had started in February, that summer we went to the National Student Association, the largest student organization in the country, and liberal, and there I heard a man who later was very prominent and still is named Curtis Gans. He had come from Chapel Hill and he had gone around organizing students for supporting the sit-ins. I was very impressed with that. I knew that his mentor was Allard Lowenstein. Both of them later became friends of Eleanor Roosevelt, the person I&#8217;m writing about now.   When I went to Chapel Hill most people went to date. I dated some but I don&#8217;t think I ever went to an athletic event. When I told my father that I had been to Chapel Hill he said, &#8220;Was it pink?&#8221;&#8211;  EL: [Laughs]  EHW: &#8211;and I didn&#8217;t know what that meant. My philosophy professor, Warren Ashby, at Woman&#8217;s College said that was the old supposition, that Chapel Hill was communist. I did, when I was in graduate school, meet Frank Porter Graham and he certainly was the embodiment of human kindness and progress, and then I heard about the terrible, terrible racist campaign in which Jesse Helms first emerged and defeated him in a brutal, racist attack, and he had gone on at that point and was working at the United Nations.  One reason I&#8217;m interested in Eleanor Roosevelt is that I think over time she had so much personal courage, and I think I had none at all. I think had I had courage I would have not gone to graduate school but would have tried to work for a newspaper outside the South or in the South. I think if I&#8217;d had the courage I would have gone up and had Frank Porter Graham take me around the United Nations, which he said he would do. But the whole idea of living in New York, where I&#8217;d only been once in my life and that was the only time I&#8217;d ever left the state, was too daunting and I did such a safe thing in going to graduate school, and I think most of what I&#8217;ve done with my life has been safe. So I just have enormous admiration now for women who&#8211;the people I went to school with who are more out there than I ever was.   EL: Can you give a couple of examples maybe of some of the women&#8211;? Are you referring to women who&#8211;  EHW: Yes.   EL: &#8211;participated in the sit-ins?  EHW: I was just in correspondence with Sudie Duncan, who now lives in California, and when we were students&#8211;and she remembers that we were rivals. We ran for some of the same offices. But she was an intellectual and I remember we went to a state student legislature in Raleigh and we debated whether or not&#8211;and this was 1960&#8211;whether or not marijuana should be legalized, and she took the very liberal position in support of that. I was on the other side. She took the position that the student government had no right to search the dorm rooms for contraband liquor. I defended the right of student government because somebody was going to do it and I didn&#8217;t want the state to do it. Later she did things that she has talked about. She taught in a very prestigious private school in San Francisco and understood that that didn&#8217;t exactly fulfill her dreams either but that she would try to educate the children who would become a leadership class. But I remember that I&#8217;m probably now where she was then.   I think on the whole that my compatriots at Woman&#8217;s College were moderate and on the whole I think they came from conservative families, but it was our world and we could make happen what we wanted to make happen, and that was liberating. I felt more that I was drinking from a draught of refreshing water more than any single event, but it did mean that later on&#8211;. The first book I wrote was based on interviews with black women in North Carolina, for which I got a National Endowment grant. I was very proud that the government of the United States had the National Endowment for the Arts and for the Humanities, and that even though I really was at that point just a stay-at-home mother that they invested in my proposal that allowed me to go around the state interviewing people, as you are doing, and there I met the Southern Oral History Project that you work with, with Jackie Hall, who was my advisor. It was a very safe thing to do, I never thought it was courageous, but I did think that it brought me closer to what I wanted to do. It was not appreciated in my home, in Columbus, that I had done that. I gave a great many lectures out of that book, called Hope and Dignity, and I joined other organizations working for race progress.   I was president of People for the American Way and that brought me in touch with an anniversary celebration of the first sit-ins, and there I met Frank McCain, who was one of the original students. I went up to him and introduced myself to him and I began by saying I was at Woman&#8217;s College in 1960 when you were sitting in at the Woolworth counter. He&#8217;s a big man, and he threw his arms back and he said, &#8220;Ah, you were one of those white women who helped me,&#8221; and I said, &#8220;No, I didn&#8217;t, and I just have come to apologize.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Well, you&#8217;re with me now,&#8221; and he hugged me, and that felt very forgiving.   So I would say that I have operated out of a place of privilege because I belong to an academic family, live at Wake Forest, don&#8217;t have to worry about bringing in enough money to sustain us. My husband does that. But I have tried in my group, my age group, to step out and be on the fringe of what we call liberal politics, and I think most people would say that I am there. I have the courage of my opinions and don&#8217;t hesitate to express them but I recognize that I&#8217;m not penalized for them. I don&#8217;t have to&#8211;. I&#8217;m not going to be fired tomorrow or marginalized. I try to be onto my own shortcomings before anybody else is [Laughs] and I think that I haven&#8217;t yet done anything that I would say was really courageous, though I think I have modeled a life for younger women, for my children, of a woman who, for my generation and my race and my class, was different. I was somewhat different.  EL: So I want to go back just for a minute. I think you mentioned Woman&#8217;s College as being an oyster for you, kind of finding a place, and you&#8217;ve described some of that. Can you say a little bit about what it meant to be at a women&#8217;s college, especially knowing that Chapel Hill wouldn&#8217;t take you until you were a junior? You also said that you didn&#8217;t really want to go at that point because Woman&#8217;s College was so wonderful.  EHW: Well I had come out of this tradition of strong women in my family so it was nothing new at all. I had a wonderful father but it was really a matriarchy, and it was just a seamless transition from home to college and I probably at first scarcely noticed that I was in another world because it was still a world of women. All my teachers, mostly, had been women. But I was not somebody who dated very much. I wasn&#8217;t chasing boys and they weren&#8217;t chasing me. I had been athletic and I had been editor of the school newspaper and I had written the school play, so I knew boys but I wasn&#8217;t in the dating game so it was ideal for me that&#8211;. I mean would I have been president of the student body at Chapel Hill in 1961 if I could [have gone]? No. I wouldn&#8217;t be. It just wasn&#8217;t a position then for women, though in a few years I knew a woman at Wake Forest who was president of the student body so maybe I am selling her short. She was.   I did everything. I ran for every office, I ran programs, I spoke on stage, I always represented the university; at the same time I was student teaching at Curry [a public school in Greensboro] and I just loved it. I loved to teach and they loved me because I was extremely energetic. Harriet Elliott said the campus is the classroom, and I believe very much in that and so did Dean Taylor, so if I was president of the dormitory I made sure that all of our house meetings were about learning and were about opportunity. I took that very seriously, probably as seriously as anybody. I was in the group of women who made their mark really in student government and I think that was because it was a women&#8217;s college. I think I had models. I had great women teachers. Dr. May Bush, who had a PhD from Hopkins; Miss Vera Largent, who had a master&#8217;s degree, who wrote to me in the summer with a reading list; Dr. Warren Ashby was wonderful, had us in his home; Mr. Randall Jarrell. But there&#8217;s just no question that the women&#8217;s culture appealed to me. When I went to Wake Forest in graduate school there was certainly for me nothing special about Wake Forest. In fact I was quite miserable. I have known it now for forty years in relation to my husband&#8217;s job as an administrator and as a teacher and I have deep affection for Wake Forest, but I would say that my passion has always been for Woman&#8217;s College because I felt like it formed me and I think it formed me as a woman.   I didn&#8217;t really participate in the women&#8217;s movement per se. I was all for the ERA. Meyressa Schoonmaker will tell you about going to Raleigh for the ERA. I didn&#8217;t. I was certainly for it, I certainly read Betty Friedan. I had groups of women in my house. I have always reached out to younger women, particularly those who wanted to write. But I think that you&#8217;re lucky if you have an experience early on that stamps you for life in a positive way, and I think going to a women&#8217;s college did that. I later taught a few years at Salem College for Women and I enjoyed that too.  EL: How many women were in your master&#8217;s program here at Wake?  EHW: It was very, very small, maybe we had&#8211;. I don&#8217;t remember. Maybe we had ten people in English and maybe half were women. All of my teachers were men. There was a great woman professor here who now has been my neighbor, Dr. Elizabeth Phillips. I didn&#8217;t have the good sense to take her classes. I was just too miserable, being cast out of Eden,&#8211;  EL: [Laughs]  EHW: &#8211;to even think about class. I was just floundering.  EL: And did you have negative experiences at Wake that made it more miserable or was it just being away from Woman&#8217;s College?  EHW: It was just being away from Woman&#8217;s College. Wake Forest had moved to Winston-Salem in 1957. This was 1962. It had a sorority and a fraternity system. It was very small. There was activity around liberal issues, and I have come to know some of the people who participated in the desegregation of schools in Winston-Salem and I admire them, but at the time&#8211;. All of my love for Wake Forest has been since my marriage. I didn&#8217;t love it then, I was just miserable. It was a small program and they didn&#8217;t do anything really for us, and of course I thought I was cock of the walk, I mean I just thought I walked on water, [Laughs] and it was pretty humbling to be back into living in a dormitory. [Laughs] So I think I had my built-in misery, I don&#8217;t think it was Wake Forest, but then it was not an exciting place.   EL: So when you were in graduate school what were you looking towards in terms of a career?  EHW: I didn&#8217;t have any idea. No idea at all. I wrote my thesis on Emily Dickinson, so I was interested in poetry, I was interested in women. I did not have a clue. In fact when I was offered the job at Wake Forest I didn&#8217;t really want to take it, but Dr. Phillips, who was one of the earliest women tenured at Wake Forest, said I really should take it, that I should help the English department help the cause of women, and since I didn&#8217;t know what else to do I took it. I had just sort of&#8211;. Everything has not gone according to any plan for me. I just really operate out of instinct. Soon after that I met Ed Wilson and fell in love with him and with his mind and with his liberal politics, and I could see that it would be a wonderful life here, and it has [been]. I always think that there are so many possibilities for what you might have done, and I don&#8217;t have any regrets, but I&#8217;m just telling you like it is.  EL: Right, right. So you mentioned you stayed home with your children when they were young here on the campus. Did you feel like you had time to write and to do what you wanted to do then?  EHW: Well I&#8217;ve always been busy. I joined everything, I did everything. I had a housekeeper, a black woman named Mrs. Maggie Martin, who for years worked in our home, and we still go to see Mrs. Martin, take pride in her family and she in ours. I was gone all the time. I often did write for small amounts of money, did write poetry, stories, essays, did give lectures, did write books, and now have this studio that you see over your shoulder which I got when I turned sixty. I&#8217;m now seventy-three. I have co-authored with Margaret Smith the history of women in the state, and then I did a gardener, Elizabeth Lawrence. I had an agenda, I and everybody else marginalizing women who don&#8217;t marry, who are white, upper class and who garden. That&#8217;s the way I felt about Elizabeth Lawrence and I wanted to address my own prejudices. So I spent about ten years working on the life of Elizabeth Lawrence, this noted gardener, edited her letters, wrote her biography, had enormous admiration for her, never met her.   Then I wanted to do a different kind of woman and that&#8217;s why I&#8217;m doing&#8211;. Hillary Clinton brought me to Eleanor Roosevelt. I should say that I became very active in politics when my son [Ed Wilson] ran for statewide office as lieutenant governor and was defeated by the now governor, then running for reelection as lieutenant governor, Beverly Perdue. So I became very active in the Democratic Party. I became very active for Hillary Clinton, met her, hosted Chelsea Clinton in my home, met Hillary Clinton&#8217;s staff. One of the deep disappointments of my life was that some of my women friends my age did not support Hillary, supported Barack Obama, as I later did, as I now am doing, but there was a real division in my age group among women who supported Hillary and women who supported Barack Obama. I was enormously proud and impressed that a young African American man, Barack Obama, was running for president, but in my mind then and in my mind now there was never any question who was the more qualified, and many of my women friends, for whatever reasons, they&#8217;d have to speak for themselves, did not work for Hillary Clinton, and I can call out their names right now.   EL: [Laughs]  EHW: Some of them are my best friends, and I was angry and I was hurt. I thought she had a terrible campaign for a whole lot of reasons but I was committed to her for being the first woman who really had a shot at being president, and plus I liked her. I harbored that anger and that hurt as I went into the campaign for Barack Obama and worked for him&#8211;my family in Georgia, now very Republican&#8211;and met Michelle Obama and have great admiration for the Obamas, but in the same way that I love Woman&#8217;s College I love Hillary Clinton and I really started reading the life of Eleanor Roosevelt as a way to heal the wound of the way I thought she had been treated, and I think that&#8217;s why she turned to Eleanor Roosevelt. Then when you read the life of Eleanor Roosevelt you see really how abused she was.   So that&#8217;s where I am today, I&#8217;m writing about Eleanor Roosevelt and I&#8217;m working for Barack Obama, and I think Hillary Clinton has answered all of her critics. Like Eleanor Roosevelt she has been an absolute brilliant woman of the world. She, I guess, must be ten years younger than I and she was president of her class and made her commencement speech, and I remember it. She, in giving the address at Wellesley, the Massachusetts Senator, US Senator, Edward Brooke, I believe, had just spoken, and he in effect had said, now you girls stop misbehaving, stop acting up, and you go on and you be good wives and mothers, or something to that effect, and she looked down at all of her friends on the front row who were just jumping up and down on the edge of their seats, and she just tossed aside the speech she had made and she lit into it. They were not happy at Wellesley but she said, you know, there&#8217;s no turning back. I tried to remember if there was any sass in my speech. There wasn&#8217;t much, but when I was a commencement speaker it got the attention of Bill Friday, who was the great president, still is, president emeritus, and the great Terry Sanford, who my son went on to work for in Washington. The courageous thing I did that day, first of all, I really had to always push myself for the public speech because it always terrified me but I always did it, and I did it well and I held my own. Terry Sanford always used to laugh about how I did better than he. I remember that my speech was very literary. I laced it with references to poetry because I could see my teacher, Randall Jarrell. I knew he would be there and he was and he appreciated it. But that&#8217;s my story and I&#8217;m sticking to it.  EL: [Laughs] You&#8217;ve had a couple of projects that have really looked at women&#8217;s lives, and one including oral histories, and you said you didn&#8217;t think of yourself as particularly involved in the women&#8217;s movement. I&#8217;m wondering, do you mean organizationally?  EHW: Yes. I think behind the scenes I have always been a feminist and there&#8217;s no doubt about it and everybody knows it. Everybody knew that I was going to support Hillary Clinton. But I did not join protests in support of the ERA, though I was for it. I think in book clubs we read Betty Friedan.  EL: She spoke here as well, in 1970, I think.  EHW: She did. I did not do any protest movement&#8211;. By then I had had my Woman&#8217;s College experience and for me living the life as a feminist was more important than marching, though maybe I&#8217;m just not a marcher. I&#8217;m trying to remember. There was something I did in the women&#8217;s movement that just slipped my mind, but I think I was a well known feminist but I wasn&#8217;t president of women&#8217;s organizations or&#8211;. Now recently I&#8217;ve done something that I am proud of. I have been very public about my support for equality, particularly for same sex marriage, and I marched with those who opposed the marriage amendment and was perfectly willing to be arrested at the courthouse. This was a few months ago, and I was really sad and appalled that North Carolina approved the marriage amendment. And I have become very churched because I go to the St. Anne&#8217;s Episcopal Church here, which is just a core group of active people in behalf of progressive causes, and they and our African American minister were very much opposed to the marriage amendment. So I would say that&#8217;s been my most visible public protest.  EL: Do you think you had planned to write about women&#8217;s lives&#8211;  EHW: Yes, I think I had.  EL: &#8211;or be a poet? I mean do you see those two as kind of going together?  EHW: I do. I think whether it&#8217;s a poem or a biography it doesn&#8217;t really matter. I could get more biographies published than I could poems. I could be more forthright. I could write a good poem but I cannot write an exceptional poem. I think I can write an exceptional biographical essay about women. I think I&#8217;m more of a prose writer. I remember my teacher, Randall Jarrell, said to me, you have to decide whether you want to be a president or a poet, and I knew right away I wanted to be president. I still write poetry but I knew that I was in the world of prose because I believe in political advocacy.  EL: One more question? Do we have time for it? You said that you consider yourself more, or maybe other people think of you, as a fringe liberal, at the fringe of being a liberal. I wonder, looking toward young women today in particular, what would you say it means to be at the fringe? What kinds of methods really are effective for bringing about social change? I know we&#8217;ve talked about marching and how you sort of chose a different path.  EHW: Well I should say about myself that in a way nobody is more of an establishment person than I am, because my husband, Ed Wilson, is the single best known person at this large, elite, private university, so in a way it&#8217;s contradictory. Though I feel very much like a rebel and I feel very much on the side of protest, in fact the life I live is sheltered by a very large establishment of Wake Forest. But within that, anybody who knows me in town knows that I am a very spirited liberal. There are a lot of faculty members here, women faculty members, who have the same protection I have but I have to say are not out there advocating for the causes that I am. So I take pride. In saying that I&#8217;m on the fringes I&#8217;m saying that you have to take every opportunity you have to take a stand, and I make people very uncomfortable because this is often in social settings and people don&#8217;t really want to argue politics but I insist on it, and they pretty much know me now. But people who don&#8217;t may just think I&#8217;m another crazy woman. I speak to a lot of garden clubs about the garden writer and I know well enough to present myself as a so-called Southern lady, though not exactly, but there&#8217;s never any question in that audience, if they know anything about me, that I can turn on a dime and that I&#8217;m going to say what I&#8217;m going to say. I like the underdog. I don&#8217;t care how establishment I am, I will always feel pride that my grandfather worked in a mill and that my father ran a trailer park, and when I was taken into the Junior League I said, well, I guess I&#8217;m the first person whose father worked in the trailer park, and they were so embarrassed. I obviously took delight in sort of sticking it to them, and nevertheless I did join the Junior League, didn&#8217;t I, but I didn&#8217;t stay there very long. I believe that every single opportunity you have to step out and say, &#8220;Wait a minute. Does everybody really feel that way?&#8221; I&#8217;m on the vestry now of the church and they know in vestry meeting that I&#8217;m going to say something that&#8217;s going to be on the fringe. It&#8217;s going to say, &#8220;I don&#8217;t think so, or I do think so.&#8221;   Eudora Welty said in [her autobiographical memoir], One Writer&#8217;s Beginnings, &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to be eclipsed&#8221;&#8211;I think that&#8217;s her verb, and I may have it wrong but this is the gist&#8211;&#8220;but I don&#8217;t mind being invisible, which is a position of great power.&#8221; I, more and more&#8211;. I used to be so out front when I was in college and now I really take great pleasure in sending out six emails this week suggesting to somebody that they might do something, and some of that comes to fruition. I would be a better poet and I&#8217;d write more books if I didn&#8217;t give away so much time and energy, but I do. You know I never liked that motto in high school when you were taken into the National Honor Society, &#8220;Noblesse Oblige,&#8221; because I never felt that I was privileged in any way, but I am because I&#8217;m educated and I&#8217;m supported. I hope in the next decade that I have enough energy left to be more radical than I am and still to do it from the fringes, because I know myself that you can be co-opted by love and affection and loyalty. There&#8217;s certain things I&#8217;m not&#8211;. I&#8217;m not going to burn down Wake Forest. It&#8217;s the hand that feeds me and I love it. But you know if I could&#8211;. Right now I&#8217;m in charge of Forsyth County&#8217;s Women for Obama, and my whole plan is to reach people who are not just actively engaged in politics, as I am, because I think there are just a lot of good people out there.   But your last question was, I forgot, about being a liberal.  EL: I think you&#8217;ve more than answered it just in terms of&#8211;.  EHW: I don&#8217;t want to represent myself any different from the way I am. I always, after I say something, stand back and say, &#8220;Is that true, and if you ask me tomorrow will it be true?&#8221; But I think you&#8217;re talking to enough people that you&#8217;ll get a&#8211;. And I have to say as a person interested in literature, one thing that studying literature gave me that I might not have gotten if I&#8217;d studied political science is everybody has a story and every story is worth telling and everybody ought to have the privilege of telling that story. It makes me more sympathetic to people whose political views are different from mine, because I always want to know: Where&#8217;s that story coming from?  EL: I think that&#8217;s a great way to end.  EHW: Thank you.  EL: Thank you, so much.
