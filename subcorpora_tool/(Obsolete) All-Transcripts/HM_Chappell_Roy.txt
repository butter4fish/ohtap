Speaker 1: There are some kind of "People Magazine"-type questions I'm going to ask you before we really get into the depth of the interview.  First one is, you know, what's your favorite food?
Speaker 2: Favorite food?  It changes from time to time, but I suppose I would say roast chicken is one of my favorites and barbeque, and (unclear) I do a real good job of that; and as usual, macaroni and cheese.
Speaker 1: What's your favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: I think summer is my favorite time of the year.  I like flowers.  I like to fool around in gardens and planting things.  So I would say summer.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What's your favorite color?
Speaker 2: Brown.  No question about that. Yeah.
Speaker 1: Why do you like brown so much?
Speaker 2: I don't know.  I just--it's just a color that's sort of--it's sort of soft, relaxing, and I get that kind of feeling from brown; and that's why we like it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What's your favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: As of now, Mexico.  When we would go--we try--we go to Mexico quite frequently.  Now it's in--we go down in--and we stay at a special hotel, and we like it very much.  I enjoy going to Acapulco.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Mr. Chappell, do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Yes, I suppose so.  I have two favorite songs, and out of one of the favorite songs is "I Believe I Can Fly," and that in itself says one of the things that I really believe in, because I see a lot of things in that song, religious and otherwise, and it has quite a message for youngsters.

Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  Now, what are your parents' names?  What were your parents' names?
Speaker 2: My father's name was Lionold Chappell.  My mother's name was Flora Chappell.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Can you spell the first names?
Speaker 2: Lionold was, L-I-O-N-O-L-D.  And my mother's name was Flora, F-L-O-R-A.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Thank you.  Can you name your brothers and sisters?
Speaker 2: I had an older brother named William Chappell, and I have a younger sister named Emma Chappell.  And Emma is, E-M-M-A.
Story_ID: 54761
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Now, where were you born?
Speaker 2: Williamsburg, Kentucky, in the southeastern part of Kentucky very near the Tennessee line.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And you spent your life in Williamsburg?
Speaker 2: No.  We lived in Williamsburg.  I was born in Williamsburg.  We lived there for approximately for about my first six years.  We left Williamsburg when we moved to Pineville for the second grade.  I started school in Williamsburg, and we had a one-room schoolhouse up on the hill, as they would say.  And all the eighth grades were in this one classroom.  And one of the strange things about the school was that there was a town out from Williamsburg about 14 miles, and they had to bus some of the black kids in to the school, and they only had the one bus for the town.  So they said, "If I bring one group in first, they had to go to school last so we can balance it.  And so they would pick up the white students first and bring them into school, and then the second thing in the morning they'd pick up the black kids and bring them in.  And since he brought them in last, they had to leave first to go home, which shortened their school day.  It's just one of those kinds of things that happens when you're in that kind of environment.
Story_ID: 54762
Speaker 1: Can you tell me, I guess, more about your mother.  Was she from Williamsburg, too?
Speaker 2: She was from that part of the state, from Williamsburg.  And she did some teaching in her younger years before she met my father.  And she met my father, and they were married.  And my father was in the military for a number of years, and his Army stationed down in Texas with Pancho Villa and that kind of thing.  And he--
Speaker 1: And he--what unit was he part of?
Speaker 2: He was down there in about from 1915 to, like, 1919, until that part of the time through there.
Speaker 1: I know I read some material that he was possibly a Buffalo Soldier?
Speaker 2: Yes.  He was in the regiment that was the Buffalo Soldier, from down there.  And he was a chef cook.  He was a mess sergeant and he cooked there and he was with the Buffalo Soldiers.  And as I used to hear him say, it was about seven or eight years.  And my brother was born when he was down in New Mexico.
Speaker 1: When was your mother born?
Speaker 2: Back around 1900, I think; somewhere along about that time.
Speaker 1: And your father?
Speaker 2: Same.  About the same time.
Speaker 1: The same.
Speaker 2: Mm-mm.
Story_ID: 54763
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  You have any--what are your memories of growing up?  What sights, sounds, smells, and activities do you remember as you were coming up?
Speaker 2: The thing of it is that, we moved to Pineville, and we didn't stay in Pineville very long.
Speaker 1: Is it Pine Bluff you're saying?
Speaker 2: Pineville, Kentucky.
Speaker 1: Pineville.
Speaker 2: Kentucky.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: (Unclear).
Speaker 2: And we didn't stay there very long, but we stayed there a couple of years.  And my father got a--since he was a chef cook, he got a job in Monroe, Michigan, and we moved to Monroe.  But in Kentucky, one thing I remember about Pineville was, we had a flood; and, a kid about seven or eight years old--seven years old--we had to stay in this person's house, and we stayed on the second floor, when the kids could always go down on the steps and put their feet in the water and everything.  And it was a very big-joy to us, you know.  We didn't see nothing wrong with the flood.  And that was one of the things I enjoyed.  And then Pineville was a little better.  Pineville had about a six-room school, and that was much better from that particular thing.  And just the usual kind of things that kids can do in a small town, where you're very close to a lot of things and nature.  We did a lot of those kind of things, and I really enjoyed that.  And then we moved to Pine--we moved to Monroe.  And when I moved to Monroe, I was in the second grade.  And it was an interesting thing about it in being at that age you don't notice it very much, how moving from a segregated situation into an integrated school.  And I didn't notice because there were very few blacks in the school.  It was a large--like, Monroe has this town of about 20,000 people.  And the school was--had--I guess it had maybe, 15, 20 rooms; couple of grades--couple for each grade.  And I entered that school in the second grade.  And it was interesting.  I really enjoyed that.  And one of the things that happened to me while I was there, it only went to the sixth grade.  When I was in sixth grade, they made me the captain of the safety patrol, and I'd have to go around and check my posts and check all the fellas that were doing--that was safety patrols and make my reports and things.  And I really liked it.  And when I reflect back and think about it, it's the first time that I was placed in a leadership role, and I didn't think anything about that.  It was just a job that I was given, and I wanted to, you know, do it the best I could.  I always was a good student, and I got extremely good grades when I was in grammar school.  And from that time, begin to move into high school.
Story_ID: 54764
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now you say your father was the chef?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And what did your--where did he--I mean, is what kind of places did he (unclear?) restaurants (simultaneous) (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Hotels.  He strictly was hotels.  He did hotels in Kentucky, and he did hotels when we moved to Monroe.
Speaker 1: Now, what did your mother do?
Speaker 2: She was a housewife?  She's strictly a housewife.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have any particular memories about your mother?  What was she like and what kind of person was she like?  Was she involved in community life around (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Yes, she was.  Well, she was very active in the church, and involved in the kind of things--(unclear) kind of things that women were involved in.  You know, the kind of socials and all those kinds of things that they had.  And they usually would always have, like, a black history kind of thing, and church, so the kids could get some kind of idea of some of the black history and things.  And those kinds of community things she was involved in.  My father was active in this little small town in politics. And one time he even ran--he was the first black in that town do it--to run to be a commissioner, nothing to say that he got beat pretty badly.  But he stayed in politics and went to state conventions, and that kind of thing.
Speaker 1: Was he Republican or Democrat?
Speaker 2: Democrat.
Speaker 1: Democrat?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: That was sort of breaking tradition in those days.  Right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  He was the first one breaking tradition and things, in that particular kind of town.  Our town had, like, five--(unclear) like in Chicago, they aldermen were in that town, like, representatives of the districts.  And he was very active--very active in politics.
Speaker 1: Just for the record, what town was this again?
Speaker 2: Monroe.  Monroe, Michigan.
Speaker 1: Monroe, Michigan.
Speaker 2: It's about 18 miles north of Toledo, and about 40 miles south of Detroit.
Story_ID: 54765
Speaker 1: How long did you stay in Monroe, Michigan?
Speaker 2: Well, I stayed there until I went into the military.
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: And it was--Monroe was quite a town; for me it was.  I had a wonderful time there and a wonderful experience, you know.  At that time, the Depression hit, and we had to move into the Depression and things, but my activities in the school were extremely good.  I was still a good student always.  And I was involved on the football team and the track team.  On the football team, I was on the varsity for the last two years I was there.  And on the track team, I was on the track team for all four of my years in high school.  My last two years, I was the high point man on the track team and had a chance to go to the state meet.  And everybody wanted to go to the state meet, because if we were going from Kentucky, we went up to Michigan State in East Lansing, and we had a chance to sleep in a hotel.  And it was interesting.  We get in the hotel, and some of the other fellas were up on another floor and would call up on the telephone and says--and, you know, all that kind of conversation you have about, "How is it up there," and "How is it down here?"  And we enjoyed that.  And I enjoyed that kind of experience.  I ran the high and low hurdles (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: I was getting ready to ask you.
Speaker 2: --and broad jump and on the relay team.  I did that.  Had a couple of interesting experiences.
Speaker 1: What was the name of your high school?
Speaker 2: Monroe High School.
Speaker 1: Monroe High School.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And had a couple of interesting experiences on the athletic teams.  On the football, we were in what were called the Border City League, and we played with a lot of the suburbs of Detroit [Michigan].  And we played them on one night, and we were staying over to watch a football from the University of Detroit.  And we had to go out to eat, so we all went in a restaurant.  And the coach came up to me and told me that the manager didn't want me to eat in the restaurant.  And some of the guys were going down the street, and I go down the street and eat with them, and I did.  In that same year in the spring, my track team was up there, and we all went in a restaurant.  And they told the coach that--we had about three or four blacks on the team--that we couldn't eat there.  And the coach took the entire team out of the restaurant, took us to a place where all of us could each together.  And, you know, this was just that kind of things that you would see that would give you an idea of what is really going on and the kind of persons that you have to deal with.  And then I finished high school.  I finished in the top ten percent of my class, and I was the only black in my class graduating with 250 students.  And so that was--that was a very, very interesting experience.  And we did a lot of things in Monroe.  I played in every kind of sport there is.  I tried everything.  I even tried boxing and the golden gloves and that kind of thing.  And we had a number of fellas that were---turned out to be extremely good boxers out of Monroe, but I was terrible.  And I had a brother--it was my older brother was a--he was a good boxer.  And--example, one time I had one fight and I knocked the fella down, and I think I was more surprised than he was.  And I went on and I finally lost the fight.  And my brother told me, he said, "You need to give this up."  So I said, "Okay.  I'll give it up and go into these other things."  And we did that all the time.
Story_ID: 54766
Speaker 1: What was your social life like in school?  What kind of a kid were you (unclear) social?
Speaker 2: Being involved in athletics, I was really into the athletic kind of thing so much so that between my junior and senior year, that summer I brought about hurdles home with me--And I lived on a dead-end street, the "L" Street, that was a dead end--and I put them out on the side of the sidewalk and things there.  And I could practice every day, because I had them out there and they were there.  Anytime I wanted to, I just run over and jump over some hurdles and things and did that.  And we had softball teams, and we had picnics and we went swimming a lot 'cause it was right on Lake Erie.  So we did a lot of swimming and those kind of things.  (unclear) that wasn't there, but we had little parties, house parties and things, and they were always on the mild side.  Another thing, you know, that kids would get into and that kind of thing.  And it was very enjoyable.  And I also belonged to the Boy Scout Troop.  And we'd go to camp every summer.  And once summer I was in camp, and I got honored in the camp as the best in our troop and the best in the camp for that thing.  And one of the initiation things is that for part of the night we had to go out--it was a small lake there--we had to go out in a boat by our self for the night and stay out in the lake for about two or three hours and come back in, and that kind of thing.  And all that was really--it was really, really nice; and, you know, a lot of things you can enjoy.  And my parents enjoyed that and seeing me always getting involved with these kind of things.  And they made it very nice.
Speaker 1: Did you have a girlfriend in high school?
Speaker 2: Not really, you know.  Not really.  And for just for a little--some of the other guys did, but I just--I just wasn't into that.  And it's interesting that I have a couple of grandsons and a nephew, and they're all about the same age.  They put my picture up in their apartment and things and says young ladies come and look at it and said, "Oh, what a nice looking man," says, "He is really nice looking.  He's fine," you know.  And so they ask me, says, "Grandpa," says, "Were you a player?"  And I said, "A player?"  I says, "Man," I says, "No."  I said, "I wasn't even a player."  Said, "I didn't even know I could be a player."  I said, "I had no idea how.  I had no--really a concept of how I looked and how I came across to people."  And I tell folks now, I said, "Yeah, the kids say I missed my shot."  I could have been a player then, but I didn't realize that I had that kind of potential.
Story_ID: 54767
Speaker 1: Okay.  So--well, you graduated from high school in what year?
Speaker 2: Nineteen-forty [1940].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I've always--when I was in high school--I always wanted to go to college, and that was one of my things that was in part of my plans, things that I wanted to do.  And since I was from Kentucky, I decided I wanted to go back and go to Kentucky State.  And so I went and enrolled in Kentucky State.  My father died when I was a--in my last year in high school, and I had no idea about how I would get through school and pay for that kind of thing, but my family got together and they got me enough money to get down and get started in school.  And my older brother, he was two years older than I was, was the one that was, like, taking care of the family, he got married about that time, and they lived with, him with my mother--his wife--all lived together.  And when I would come home from school, that's where I would stay.  And between all of the family members and things and working while I was in school, I was able to stay there.
Speaker 1: Did you have any idea of what you wanted to be, I guess, or do professionally as an adult as you--when you graduated from high school?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I wanted to be a teacher, and I wanted to teach chemistry.  So I went into--I was in science and I was in the chemistry program while I was there and that was one the thing that I got involved in.  And I got involved in a lot of different kind of things when I was at Kentucky State.  I was the president of the sophomore class and president of my junior class.  And I was on the, I think, the council that they have for the students who were on the council and things; I was on that.  I was the--they decided to open up a co-op-they brought people in who did a study to find out whether it would be profitable or not.  And we decided to open up one at the school.  And I was the first president of the co-op (unclear)--
Speaker 1: The co-op is a store?
Speaker 2: Store.  Yeah.  Store.  A store and a restaurant, things that were at the school.  I did that.  I was on the honor roll.  And for that particular kind of things, and got things like best science student and all these kinds of things while I was there.  And I didn't go out for the track team while I was there, but they had the intramural program, and I got involved in the intramural programs and track and things.  And I won the hurdle races and even the hundred-yard dash and the broad jump, and that kind of thing.  We were still young, still very good doing that kind of thing, some things to do that.
Story_ID: 54768
Speaker 1: Did you have any sense that--now, while you were graduating from high school and entering college, the world was sort of in turmoil, you know, around, you know, World War Two, you know, during a brink of the World War (unclear).  Did you have any sense of that coming at that time?
Speaker 2: Yeah, because with the breaking out and things like that and the draft coming up, everybody, you know, over that age had the draft and had to sign up for the sign up for the draft, so I knew that I had to sign up for the draft, and I did.  And knew that eventually my number would come up and I'd have to go into the military.  So that was one thing that was always hanging some things.  And in Frankfort, where Kentucky State is, it's not that far from Louisville and Louisville was not that far from Fort Knox; so all that was there, and those kinds of things were going on.  So we knew that was coming up.  And people, friends that I had, were coming back on furloughs from the military, and we'd see, you know, quite a bit of that, it all going on all the time.  And so, you know, I had to give some serious thought about that, what I wanted to do and where I wanted to go on that particular kind of thing.
Speaker 1: So a draft was going on --
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --at that point, and you were exempt while you were in school (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I got an exemption while I was in school, but they said after a certain length of time, like, six months, they could call you up according to how whether they were able to fill their quota, put in for the draft at that time or not.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  So what was your decision?
Speaker 2: Well, I knew that I didn't want to go into the Army.  I didn't want to just take a chance and go (unclear) and end up in the Army and that kind of thing.  So I found out that--they told us that they were taking, giving examination to let people go into the Cadet Corps, which would eventually end up into Army Air Corps.  And so I decided to go and take this test and see if I could pass it and get on that eligible list.  And that's what I did.  I took the test, passed it, and got on the eligible list.  I just had to wait then 'til I got called up and see.  And eventually I did.
Story_ID: 54769
Speaker 1: When were you called up?
Speaker 2: I called up in '43 [1943], and they--we were shipped--we went--they took us into an induction center up in Ohio.  And then from Ohio, since I was in the cadets, they shipped me to Biloxi, Mississippi, where I had my basic training.  And a number of us were sent down there, and that was on the coast of Mississippi.
Speaker 1: All the way in the South.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And you run into that kind of thing, and you think about it and everything.  And one of the other things that I used to think about, how it didn't make any sense to me, is that mostly every summer, we'd go from Monroe back to Kentucky for vacation, 'cause some of my family was still there.  We'd get on an integrated train in Monroe and ride to Cincinnati; we'd get off the train in Cincinnati, walk across the station and get on a segregated train.  And I'd tell the kids about that today when I go out and make talks and speeches and things.  I said, "You just think about this now.  You're going from--all that I did, I'm still the same person, I look just like I looked, I'm acting the same way.  I walk across the station and everything changes."  And one of the things that they had on the railroad cars was a little strip, a triangle kind of strip that they hang up in each coach, and it would say, "white, colored," and the other side would be blank.  And fellas would always sort of decide to make souvenirs out of these and take them and have them in their rooms in college and that kind of thing.  But, you know (unclear)--
Speaker 1: (Unclear)
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And they had them in the college and things, and everybody would have one.  Almost everybody had one. And they have them in there and see. But this made me realize the kinds of things that were going on and how you had to be able to adapt and keep your behavior in control with all these kind of things that were going on.  And I think that's one of the things that--all these kind of things I was running into, like the thing with the football coach and that kind of thing prepared me for the kind of things I would run into, and it gave me the ability to be able to deal with them.
Speaker 1: So you got to Biloxi, Mississippi, and I guess you did face some of the discrimination you faced at Kentucky?
Speaker 2: Not really, 'cause we were in Biloxi, Mississippi.  They had us on camp, and since we're going through basic training, we stayed on the camp.  We didn't even go to town.  The whole time I was there, I didn't even get off the base.  And all you do is, you know, just train every day and that particular kind of thing.  But that was all that was going on.  So you didn't really get to see, you know, like going in town and how the people would treat you and that particular kind of thing.
Story_ID: 54770
Speaker 1: Did you have any idea--I know you joined the Army Air Corps, but did you have any idea that you would train as a pilot at some point?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  That was part of the test.  That part of the test was just to get people to come into the program and to go through the pilot training program.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So the pilot training program had been established already (when you got there?)?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  What they did is that there was a lot of agitation to integrate.  All the newspapers--the black newspapers and the black Civil Rights organizations were--they started in the late-thirties [1930s] trying to get the government to integrate and try to make some other duties in the military besides the menial kind of things they had most black people doing.  I see guys would come back from the Navy.  Everybody came back from the Navy was either in the mess department.  They had to do with that.  They had to do the cooking and housecleaning and all that kind of thing.  And that's all you'd ever see.  And the guys that would come back from Army, all of them would be in the Army in the infantry and things like that, and most of them would be in the--and they kind of used to clean up around the bases and all those particular kind of things.  So there wasn't any kind of thing that would show that people were really making any kind of progress and doing any kind of thing.  And all this agitation was going on to try to get people to be able to get into these positions and move up in these particular things in the military.  And that wasn't happening.  And they started what they call a Civilian Pilots Program, and it was in a few black colleges.  And there was one program of this in Chicago [Illinois] Ed Coffey [Cornelius Coffey] was heading up.  And some of the fellas got some pilot training in this Civilian Pilots Program. and they had one in Tuskegee and that's the one that Mrs. Roosevelt went down and visited.  It was a program they had there for the Civilian Pilots Program.  So there were some people getting trained.  But they had--at that time, they hadn't decided to let any of them come into the military and train to be an officer, because when you go back into the history that the government and the military put out about blacks and what they can actually do and couldn't do, it's an amazing kind of thing.  You couldn't command, under pressure you'd run; all these kind of things they said that were really negative about how people would do and what they would do under pressure and that particular kind of thing.  And they keep saying that they want to get these guys in and get them into this kind of program, and they didn't.
Story_ID: 54771
Speaker 1: You were talking about the agitation that was going on in the country, you know, for better conditions for black servicemen and for better opportunities.  In what forms did this agitation take in terms of people and --
Speaker 2: I think one of the things that was the backbone of it was the black newspapers, and the "Pittsburgh Courier" was really adamant about the things that they were saying and they were doing.  They were constantly at it.  And the "Defender" [The Chicago Defender] was too.  And the one thing that people may not realize is that back in this time, in the forties [1940s] and the thirties [1930s] and thing, the "Defender" shipped their papers all around the country; because I know when I was in Monroe [Michigan], I used to get a shipment every week of the "Defender"--it was a weekly thing they sent--and sell it to the people around there.  And so they were getting this message out to everybody all around the country that they wanted to have integration in the military, and they wanted people to get a better chance to be advanced in the military.  And the Civil Rights Organization, the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] was extremely helpful to us later on in my career in the military.  And all the other--Urban League and all the rest of them--were quite involved in this.  And all of the black people that were in politics were involved in pushing this kind of thing, too.  So we're getting quite a bit of agitation all the time in order to do something about this.  And it made a lot of difference.
Speaker 1: So you say it's sort of a movement or something?
Speaker 2: Yes.  It was like a movement.  And the people kept up with everything that was going on through the newspapers and those kind of things to find out about it.
Story_ID: 54772
Speaker 1: Now, this takes us to, I guess, the next step is Tuskegee [Alabama] itself.
Speaker 2: Right.  We got shipped out from Biloxi [Mississippi], and they sent us to Tuskegee [Alabama] to start our cadet training.  And the first thing that they did where we were shipped, and they put us in a unit--and we had to go to, like, a day school for about eight or ten weeks, to take some more math and all the basic kind of subjects of that kind.  And one of the teachers I remember was Wilkins, I don't know if you're familiar with him or not.  But I think Wilkins got his Ph.D. from the University of Chicago when he was about 16 or 17 years old.  He was one of the instructors.  He instructed us in math.  One of the fascinating things about him is that he could be writing--he would write with each hand on the board and be working a different kind of arithmetic problem.  You know, and he wasn't but about 18 or 19 years old then.  But it was the kind of thing that they had for that.  And we went through that.  And we stayed in something called the (Emerys?).  It's at Tuskegee.  Then they moved us over to the base, and we went through a little basic training there.  Then they moved us into the--really the flight training program.  And the flight--the pilot training program is divided into three parts; a basic, a primary--and the primary, basic, and advanced.  And each phase runs about two--two and a half months of training.  So we went over and we went into the primary part of the training.  And the primary part of training was leased out to the Tuskegee University, and we flew out of what was called Moton Field (ph), which was a ways from Tuskegee.  It was all close together.  And we flew in a Stearman, where the plane is bi--two wings and things, and that's when I first had a chance to--I know nothing about airplanes.  I had no idea.  I didn't know anything about them.  I had no idea I wanted to fly or anything like that.  But this was getting me around what I wanted to get around in the military, so I did.  And my instructor, we started flying and we had a number of hours (in about?) it's an open cockpit plane.  And after you get a few hours in, you would get the idea that, you know, you're young and you got all this energy and halfway crazy, too.  So I decided this particular day, like everybody else, to loosen up my seatbelt and making it very loose, you know, so I'd be real comfortable, I could move around in the seat and everything back there.  And they always tried to tell us keep that belt tight.  So he flipped this plane over on its back, and here I come sliding up out of this seat.  And you talk about somebody having a conniption fit.  I said, "Oh, Lord, what am I going to do?" 'Cause I never wanted to jump without a parachute.  And he looked--turned around 'cause he's in the front seat.  He turned around and looked at me and grinned and said, "Ha-ha-ha-ha."  And I said, "Ha-ha-ha," something my mother told me not to say anymore in life, and he, and I said "Turn this thing back over."  And he did.  But the message was given to me.  I learned it, and that was the end of that.  No more of that kind of stuff.  But it was interesting.  And then one day we went up, we came back down, and we landed and we taxied up to where we, you now, go in and they used to pull in off and everything.  He said, "Well, we'll stop here for a minute."  He stop it.  He jumped out.  He said, "Okay.  It's yours."  And so that means I had to go up in solo.  So that was the first time that I went up and soloed an airplane and thing.  Then we went on through the primary phase of the training and everything, and I got through that in good shape.  And, you learn how to do a lot of things.  It's amazing what you can do with an airplane and amazing when I look now and think that you can take an airplane and flip it over on its back, you can take it and make it do a loop, and you can do what they call a snap roll, and then snap roll it over quickly and that kind of thing.  And you do stalls, 'cause they teach you how in case the plane stumble, what you're supposed to do? And that--and, you know, all those kind of things.  And I had no idea about I could ever learn how to do all these things.  And it was interesting.  And we helped each other, and we got to a real wonderful shape.  So I enjoyed that.

Speaker 1: Now, you said something earlier that--you said that when you went to Tuskegee, you couldn't even drive a car yet.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Is that true?
Speaker 2: That's true, 'cause (I had something for it?), and my brother even told me something and said "I don't know how you're going to fly an airplane.  You can't even drive a car."  I said, "No, man.  I ain't driving a car."  (unclear) I'm 19 years old.  I ain't driving.  But I really couldn't.  I never had any experience driving a car.  Never learned.  But it worked out fine for that.  But then I--that was when--then we went back to Tuskegee Air Field and went into basic training, a larger plane, more horsepower, and had a closed cockpit.  You had a--I think you could pull up over in the cockpit and thing.  And we flew in that.  And they call it--it was a BT plane, and so that went very well, except that sometimes when you go up--for me--and I would be practicing and get intense, and sometimes you sort of forget where you are, and the ceiling was low this particular day; only about two or three thousand feet, and when I decided that it was time for me to head back to the base, I didn't know where I was.  I looked around, I didn't see a thing that I knew, and I couldn't get high enough to get a better perspective, and you don't know. So I said "God, I'm lost.  What am I going to do?  I got to land this plane somewhere."  And so I had to look around for a place to make this landing in this plane in the middle of all these farms.  So I picked out one, and I went down and buzzed and it come real low, and buzzed and see; and it looked like a good place to land.  So I came back and I landed in the plane, and it was like a--I guess it was like a, I don't know, a rice field or something down there.  But anyway, I landed on the field and everything was fine and everything.  And so all these farmers come running out to look at this airplane.  And I--here I am, I can't tell these farmers I'm lost.  And the guy said, "Oh."  And so I said, "I got a little engine trouble."  And they--"Oh.  Look at all those nails in the wings."  It was all those rivets and things in there.  And I told them I had to have an airplane--have a telephone and call and let people know where I am.  And I did.  And they told me, say--well, I was on the other side of Montgomery.  I was about 30 or 40 miles from Tuskegee.  They say, "We can't come and pick you up today, so find you a place to stay for the night.  We'll come and get you in the morning."
Speaker 1: Did you land in a black neighborhood or (unclear)?
Speaker 2: It was sort of mixed, you know.  I was out in the farmland.  It was sort of mixed out there.  And this farmer, he said, "Well, I can put you up for the night."  So he took me with him and put me up on some corn shucks and things for the night.  And that's where I stayed, and they came and got me the next morning.  And the strange thing about it was, when the instructors came down, they said that they wanted to know how I got that airplane in that field and didn't damage it or anything.  I said "I just came in.  I guess the Good Lord was helping me bring this thing in, like, and land here and everything."  So they had to take it and tow it out of the field to another place where they could take it off and bring it back to the camp.  Now, all the flight instructors in primary--all the flight instructors were black, and this Chief Anderson, who was the one that gave Mr. Wilson--about the flight and the plane--was over that.  But now, from the rest of the way, from basic to advanced, they were all white instructors that we had, so.
Story_ID: 54774
Speaker 1: Now, can you tell the story--I mean about Chief [Charles Alfred] Anderson and Eleanor Roosevelt?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: That's the one that's made famous by the movie.
Speaker 2: Movie.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Right.  It was before they decided to get--really open up Tuskegee [Alabama].  She heard about this pilot training program, and she went down to Tuskegee to see what was going on; you know; she, liked to investigate and see everything.  When she got down there, she decided that she wanted to go up.  And Chief [Charles Alfred] Anderson said, "I'd be glad to take you up."  And so they, the people that were with her, and all her Secret Service folks and everything, called Washington [D.C.], called the White House and everything else, trying to make sure that she didn't get a chance to fly.  And with being Mrs. Roosevelt, she--and when she made up her mind, that was the end of it.  And so she got on in the plane.  Now, he kept her up for about 30 minutes or more.  And when she came back down, she said "I don't see anything wrong with it.  These people can fly.  They need to start giving them the training and everything."  And that was the kind of thing that it was.  And Chief Anderson is an interesting story because he was in Pennsylvania, and he worked around airplanes and things and he wanted to learn how to fly.  And he saved up his money and bought an airplane, but he couldn't get anybody to give him instructions.  So he would taxi back and forth up and down the thing.  And so finally one day, he figured he got enough, and he took off and started flying, and actually taught himself how to fly.  And that was that kind of thing.  He was out of Pennsylvania, and he was the one that came in, and he was over that particular phase of training at Tuskegee.  And a lot of fellas would tell you today that they're indebted to him, because they were having problems with part of their flying program and asked the chief about it, and the chief would be able to tell them what they had to do to correct it and what (unclear) verify.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And that's incredible.
Story_ID: 54775
Speaker 1: Can you tell me about some of the other personalities involved in the Tuskegee Airmen?  Who your commanders were like, who the other enlisted men were like; any stories about, you know, the training obviously.
Speaker 2: The--I guess the one that is most widely known, and that's as it should be, and that was Benjamin O. Davis, Jr.  Benjamin O. Davis, Jr., his father was the first that was made a general.  And came from a military family.  He went to West Point.  The whole time he was in West Point, they didn't speak to him except in the line of duty, so he had the silent treatment.  He finished that.  And when he got out of West Point, he wanted to fly and he applied for it, and they told him that they didn't have a program of that kind established.  And when they did establish the program, he was in the first class that went through the program.  Now, the Tuskegee Airmen Program was designed for failure.  They made a lot of mistakes.  The first mistake they made when they wanted to start a class, they had about, I guess, 12 people in that class; all of them young, black men, college graduates; most of them had flying experience.  Say, like, Bill [sic, Ben] Davis Jr., he was in that first class.  And they came through in that class.  So now how you gonna get a young man, finished college, in his early twenties, and think he's gonna be a failure at that age, you know, and that kind of thing.  So that didn't work.  And went from there--he was one.  The person who wrote the "Tuskegee Airmen Story" for the movie, Bob Williams [Robert Williams], had this story for 40 years before he had anybody to buy it.  And every year when we go to convention, Bob would come by and say "Roy," says, "Still trying to sell that story, man."  And he tried.  And I tell kids today that when you talk about to be able to stay with something and get something accomplished, think about this.  The man had this story for 40 years, and he finally got somebody to buy it, and that's the thing that came out from that, and it was that.  And then every class--they had a class--a new class would start in pilot training every month, and usually the class would have, maybe, 30 or 40 people.  And about 15 or anywhere from 30 to 40 percent of the people did not finish.  That's what they call the (unclear); and that was the thing that went on with that.  And then after you finish each phase, you'd move on to the next phase.  When you finish--when I finished the basic training, I moved into the advanced flying training part of the program.
Story_ID: 54776
Speaker 1: Did you have any casualties in training?
Speaker 2: We had very few.  I think we only had one or two.  And that was one thing about the unit and even the unit when they started training to go overseas.  The accident rate was extremely low.  They were very good about that.  And it was unusual, because, like, at Tuskegee, they were flying a plane that we use in the basic training, and we were flying a plane we used in advanced called the AT6, that was a single engine.  They also started a program where they were training people in twin engines, and there was a twin-engine plane there.  And there was something they called a grasshopper.  People that were observers for the artillery, they would train there to fly in those planes, and they were at Tuskegee to train.  They also trained some--about five pilots from Haiti; they came in, and they were a part of the program, in for that, and they came in that particular time into the program.
Speaker 1: Did those pilots serve in World War Two (unclear)--
Speaker 2: They went back to their country, yes.
Speaker 1: They went back?
Speaker 2: They went back after, you know, the training to start that kind of thing.
Story_ID: 54777
Speaker 1: Now, were all the Tuskegee airmen trained as fighter pilots or (simultaneous) (unclear)--
Speaker 2: As they state--they started out as fighter pilots.  And the agitation kept increasing.  People were all the time wanted to expand and get in every phrase of it that they wanted.  And so they decided to start a bomber group.  And so they had to start training people to be in twin-engine planes, because we eventually ended up flying a B-25.  And then when I left the basic training, I went into the advanced program flying this twin-engine plane, and I got what they call washed out; I got eliminated in that particular part of the program.  And that happened to a whole lot of folks.  It wasn't anything unusual.  And--but the thing about it is that once they started the bomber group, they had to be able to supply all the people for that.  They did not have space at Tuskegee to train navigators and bombardiers and gunners, and all those kind of things; so they had to find a place to train us as navigators.  And so they decided to train us in Hondo, Texas.  And that's where--that was my next stop in my military career.  I went there.
Speaker 1: How do you spell that Hondo?
Speaker 2: H-O-N-D-O-.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Hondo.
Speaker 1: Like the John Wayne movie?  "Hondo?"
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Same way.  And that's where I went for that, and it was interesting.  The class that I was going to join had gone down about a week before I did, and I had--that's why they could get me in this class in that same week.  And two of us went down on the--on a railroad for this, and I was looking through some of the things that I have, and I had this meal ticket for being on the train, and if we eat on the train, we could spend a dollar (for the meal?).  If we eat in the city, you could spend seventy-five cents for the meal.  And I said--I looked at this, I showed it to (unclear).  That was the kind of thing we were into then.  But when we got to,  When I got to Hondo, I had to be in one class the navigators had completed already before us, and they had, like, a four or five week in camp between classes.  And usually you always started class--no you don't; when one finishes, another starts right after that.  And so, we got in and joined up with the class, and we started that.  There were at least 1500 cadets on the base, and there were 30-some of us; we were the only black cadets on that base.  And we had our own barracks, our own classroom, and we ate with everybody else in the mess.  And everything that we did--I would fly--I'd practice missions and training missions, because it's just our group flying, and we always would have--the pilots there were there, and we'd always had white pilots and things.  And our class was the second class.  And we were--one time we were complaining because we were going to night class four nights a week; and the school said you don't have it but one night a week.
Story_ID: 54778
Speaker 1: And then our instructor told us that the first class did not understand celestial navigation.  So they wanted us to understand this, so that's why we did all this extra work.  And once we learned how to do something, we had to do it on every practice mission that we had every time we go up.
Speaker 2: Now, celestial navigation is navigating by the stars?
Speaker 1: By the stars.
Speaker 2: (Unclear)
Speaker 1: They had something called a sextant.  It's a little instrument, and you get a--you use that to point to what they call shoot a star, and you get a reading from that, and you shoot three of them; and then you make your computations and things, and you could tell where you were.  And you had to be able to do--had to learn all the constellations and all those kind of things in order to do that.  We got to do it.  And we got to be--by getting orders to actually training and things, we got to be extra good.  We were--we were good.  We were--in fact, we were so good that our lead instructor was called Mack, and the guys would tell us, say "Listen, fly with Mack's boys," say, "They won't get you lost.  They'll have you back in good time to eat supper on time."  And so we did that.  And one of the things that, you know, sort of proved the thing in the end was that we had 14 planes, and we were going to do a rendezvous.  We were leaving out of Texas.  We were going to do a rendezvous up in Arkansas.  And the instructor says, "Now, I'm going to take off, and when I get over to the point I want you to move on to a rendezvous, I'm going to start a three-minute turn.  When I come out of that turn in three minutes, I want everybody to be there."  So that means that--and everybody took off for like three or four minutes apart.  All our planes took off at different times, so, you know, we weren't flying together.  Everybody had their own individual thing.  And so we had to adjust everything, and they call these things that you could do as navigators and get to that at the time that we're supposed to be there.  And this is the kind of thing that was important in the military.  And so when we got there and he started his turn, when he came out of his turn, all of us were there.  And they said, "Yes, this is how good these guys are.  All of them come in, they come in on the same time."  And that was one thing that happened where the guys that were overseas and flying in the P-51s for the bomb and escort.  Sometimes the--like, the--for instance, the fighters would be taking off from down in Southern Italy.  The bombers might be taking off from Northern Italy or some base 4 or 500 miles away and they'd rendezvous somewhere else.  And sometimes the bombers would come in late.  And most units, if the bombers were a little bit late, they wouldn't stay around too long, because they only have so much gas and they want to make sure they get it back.  But the guys that were in the ninety-ninth (99th) and the three thirty-second (3-32nd) thing, they would stay to the very last minute to take the bombers in and bring them out and sort of stretched the thing as much as they possibly could.  And that's the one thing that they learned how to do.  And that's, you know, the kind of--coming to these places, we learned how to do that.  And we got to be extremely good navigators.  And when we finished that course, we were commissioned and certified as, you know, navigators and things.  And it was real nice.
Story_ID: 54779
Speaker 1: And there was a time when my sister came down to pin my wings on, and the guys had some of their relatives to come down for that.  And they were all--they were getting the group together now, the 4-77 Bombardment Group, and that was--and the B-25s, and they were short on navigators and bombardiers.  And so we thought that we were going back to Godman Field.  Now, Godman Field was an air field for Fort Knox, which meant it was in no way was the kind of air field for a bomber group.  Their runway was short, they were spaced for the airplanes and all that.  We thought we were going back there, but they didn't.  They sent my entire class to bombardiering school.  So we had to go there for another eight--for another month of training thing to go through that.  And we were the--now, then we were all officers, so we were student officers for the bombardiering course.  And when we got there, one of the things they wanted us to do was eat with the cadets.  We told them, "No, we would not eat with the cadets, because we're officers, and the guy that's flying airplane is an officer, so if you're going to feed them, you can feed us."  They wanted us to march the class, we said, "No, we can't march the class, because we're officers and gentlemen.  Tell us where the class is, and we'll be there."  And all these and other kinds of things would come up.  And at this particular place, we could start going to the Officers Club, which we did.  In about two weeks' time, they called all of us in, about 30-some of us, and told us that we no longer could go to the Officers Club, because they thought they thought there was going to be some trouble and things in there.  So we called everybody we knew, we wrote everybody that we knew; NAACP {National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], "Pittsburgh Courier," "Chicago Defender"," and everybody else; so the word got out.  In about another two weeks' time, we got a little note that said that for colored officers, we cannot go back and use the Officers Club.  And the commanding officer on the base, they moved him someplace else for that particular kind of thing.  And they also wanted us--there was a short navigation course, like a four or five week navigation course on the end of the bombardiering course, so we got to have some kind of knowledge about, at least, basic navigation.  And they wanted us to take this.  We said, "No.  We won't take that course."  Said, "What we'll do, we'll be--either be instructors for you or fly as instructors for you in the thing.  But we're not--we're won't take the course."  So they said, "Okay."  They could--nothing they could about it, 'cause we was the only really navigators on the base.  And one of the strange things that came out of that is, on the weekends, when the pilots would want to take a plane--say they want to leave out of where we were at--they went up in a place called Midland, Odessa in Texas, and he wanted to go up to Kansas or somewhere, they had to have a certified navigator.  And we were the only ones on the base.  So they had to come to us to ask us to go with them if they wanted to make a trip.  So, you know, it's funny how a lot of these kind of things that are involved with that go on.  And one of the other things I would like to say too is that, whatever base that we were on, the enlisted men, the black, enlisted men there, were just--they were so proud of us, and anything that they could do to make it better for us, you know, they would do that.  If you need something, they would say, "Well, we could see if about getting that for you," and all these kind of things  And that was the kind of thing that went on, and it made it really, really, really, really nice, you know, that all these people really wanted to see and do those kind of things.
Story_ID: 54780
Speaker 1: Now, who was your--I know you said your sister came down when you received your wings and (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Mm-mm.
Speaker 1: Well, was your mother still alive then?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And how did she feel about your ascension, I guess, to--as an officer?
Speaker 2: She--her--now, my brother didn't go in the service--and, very proud; very proud and everything.  When I went back home to Monroe [Michigan], my brother--there--he was really proud of me and everything, you know.  And so he wanted to take me Downtown to see somebody salute me.  I said, "Oh, man.  You know I don't want to." So I said, "Lou, man, I don't want to bother with that kind of mess."  And he insisted it.  He insisted it.  So I said, "Okay, let's go down to (unclear)."  We went Downtown, and he would see somebody coming, military man--don't mean--he go--in the military, he go, "What are you, you see an officer, you got to salute him."  And they would salute me.  And, oh, man, he'd fall out.  And he'd see somebody coming on the other side of the street, crossed over, have them salute me and everything.  And we did it for quite a while, and then we came back home, he was so happy he didn't know what to do.  And I didn't think anything about it.  But then about three or four years later, I thought about it.  And I thought how much this really meant to him.  Now, here's his kid brother, big time officer, now, you know, in the military, and got people saluting him and everything.  And I had a friend--the guy is still a friend, lives over in Detroit [Michigan] now--he had a sister in high school.  She begged him to go uptown with her, and he said, "No.  I don't want (that kind of fun.)"  She wanted to show him off.  And he didn't.  He said--and then she died a few years later, and he said he regrets to this day that he didn't go up there and do that for her, because they had no idea--you know, you had no idea of how much people put you on a pedestal and all these kind of things; they want to do everything for you.  And one of the things we used to do, when we get on--if we have a furlough and get on a train, look for one of those good sisters that had a shoebox, 'cause we know in that shoebox was some fried chicken, pound cake, and deviled eggs.  And everybody traveled and they had it, and then they would see us, "Oh, you poor little soldier boy.  I know you're hungry.  And here, I got your chicken," "and cake and thing."  And we'd always get something to eat.  And on Sunday, we'd get a chance to go to town.  We'd always go to church.  And when the reverend would close out his sermon, he's say, "Now, you see all these soldier boys around here, sisters," say, "You know, these boys eating that bad Army food.  Now, you take them home and give them one of those good meals.  They want some turnip greens and macaroni and cheese and things."  And that would always happen, too.  And those folks were just as happy and just as nice.  Oh, it was something.  It was almost unbelievable.
Story_ID: 55330
Speaker 1: We were talking about the reception that people in the community had for the Tuskegee Airmen, you in particular, in your hometown in Michigan (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Mm-mm.
Speaker 1: At least we can continue with--now, how often did you get a chance to go home?
Speaker 2: Not very many times.  I went home about twice at the time I was in there before I got out of the military.  But it was the same both times, and it was quite a thing the way people were and things that you could do and everything.  We went to Detroit [Michigan], I'd go over and had a buddy over there, and when he took me around to the nightclubs at night, and we go in the club and things and "There's a soldier boy back there. Give him whatever they want.  Everybody at this party give them anything they want."  And the people were just that way.
Speaker 1: Now, how did your mother feel about this (unclear)?
Speaker 2: She thought it was very nice.  She had some concerns about fooling around with those airplanes and things.  But once everything came back and she saw I was still in one piece, and everything was wonderful.  Yeah.  She enjoyed it (unclear).
Speaker 1: So this recognition is, I guess, one of the highlights of being a (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, you know.  And the thing about it is, it was true of almost everyone.  The guys just took it almost in step, just like, you know, just some things you do and just tell people how much you appreciate it and that kind of thing and how much they really enjoy it and go on to the next thing we had to deal with, because there's always some things that, you know, you had to deal with.  And one of the things that was always one of the reasons that they didn't want guys to go into the military and be a pilot is because to be a pilot you have to be an officer; and to be an officer you have to be saluted, and which means you have to be in command; and then they had a hard time deciding that they wanted the black man to command a white man.  And that was one of the kind of reasons that they were reluctant about this whole thing all the way through.  And that was the kind of thing that was happening.
Story_ID: 55331
Speaker 1: Was it, was it a revelation to the young black men in the program themselves that they were able to accomplish so much in the face of all the negative attitude about what black people can do?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Because people believe, you know--it's just the idea that whatever it is--like, for me, I was in grammar school, high school with whites all the time.  They were in the majority in the school and everything.  I did everything that they did, and most of the time I was better.  I was a better student, I was a good athlete, and I was--all that kind of thing.  So anything anybody else can do, I think I can do it, you know (unclear).  And that's the way all these guys were.  Most of them were, you know, well educated, and very self assured, you know.  If everybody can do this thing, we can do it to.  So it was just whatever they put up as a barrier, get around it, and keep on going and doing the kind of things that we want to do.  And that was the kind of attitude that everybody had.  And the idea that we'd help each other whenever we had to on things of that kind and things came through very well.
Story_ID: 55332
Speaker 1: Okay.  So what were your activities for the balance of (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: When I left?  When we finished the bombardiering school, we got another rating.  So it made what you would call a dual rating.  We were rated navigator, we rated bombardiering.  There in bombardiering school, we had to deal with--what you call that--the Norden bombsight was a kind of bombsight that you using your plane that you had to pick up and put in there.  And that was what you used to drop your bombs with.  And what happened is once the bombardier got his lineup on his sight, he would tell the pilot he was on target, and the pilot would flip a switch, and then you would fly the plane through your bombsite.  And when you hear--and when the bomb sire decided you're on the target, you would drop your bombs.  So that was one of the kind of things we did there.  We had six-man crews on our team.  But then we left bombardiering school and went back to Godman Field, and we heard that--what was it--that the main group had got shipped up to Indiana into Freeman Field.  And we heard up there that they had these two officer's clubs and things that were going on, and the guys were very upset about it.
Story_ID: 55333
Speaker 1: So we came in and in a couple of days, they shipped us up to Godman Field, too--not to Godman Field--the Freeman Field.  And when we got there, you know, we found out about these two officers clubs, and they had taken the enlisted men's club and made it into an officers club.  And the commanding officer was saying that, one club was for instructor personnel, and one was for trainee personnel.  And that translated, black and white, because we had some guys there--we had a chaplain there, we had doctors there, and some other--about five--about eight or nine people--about six or seven of them, weren't really in the training program.  And we even had some guys there that were back from a tour of duty of the three-thirty-second (3-32nd).  And they came back.  And so guys started going to the club.  And they get there, the man that was in charge of the officers club would tell them that they couldn't come in--they couldn't come in there.  The guy was going, he said--and he told them you have to leave or he'll place you under arrest in quarters.  So everybody had to go back (unclear) and then go in your quarters and things.  And they had hundreds of guys went in there that way.  And so the commanding officer there was deciding that this wasn't working.  And one of the things that was going on we found out later from the Freedom of Information Act is that he was in contact with the people over him in Washington, D.C., and they were talking about what was going on, what was happening.  And so we decided to put out--now, in the military, there was an article of one of the rules said that "any officers club is open to all officers on that base."  And he was saying that they could get around this by saying this thing was for officers and trainees.  And they told him to write up this memorandum that certain facilities on the base were for instructors and for officers.  So and then they did this.  He wrote up his personnel.  He had a big meeting and read it to everybody and told them, you know, that this thing was coming up.  And then he heard again that guys were going to start coming back to the thing.  And then he had them come in and had everybody said they would either sign this thing and they understood it and sign it, and read it.  Once you do that, you have to comply with it.  And so some of us said that we didn't want to do it.  We didn't want to sign it.  So then they decided to--everybody that hadn't signed it, they had something almost like a little court-martial.  Our commanding officer was there, the man who was going to do the questioning was there, and three or four of the officers were there, and the person that was taking the testimony.  And they come in, they ask you first thing, "Have you seen the thing?  Have you read it?"  "Yes."  "Will you sign it?"  "No."  "Well, you could cross out what you don't like and sign it."  "No."  Then they would read us the Articles of War that has to do with, you know, if you don't obey your commanding officer, and you can get shot and all these other kind of things that can happen.  So they finally come down to, say, "Well, scratch out what you don't want and sign it."  We says, "No.  I won't do that."  And so then, finally, they said, "Well, let me read the Articles of War to you again."  They read that to us again.  And, "A commanding officer gives you a direct order to sign it," to Harry.  He says, "I'm not going to sign it." He says, "I'm not going to sign it today.  I refuse to sign."  So then he was placed back under arrest in quarters.  And so that there's a conversation was still going on in the thing.  So they decided to ship us back to Godman Field.  So we got shipped back; 101 of us got shipped back to Godman Field.  The bags were there, they had puts lights up all around the barracks and things, and a fence around barracks and things, and we were all there.  And the strange thing about it was, German POWs were able to walk through the barracks, and there was a gas station across the street; they were doing that, and things were going on.  See.  And these are the kind of things that were going on.  And they (simultaneous) (unclear)--
Speaker 2: There were German POWs were at Godman Field.
Speaker 1: At Godman Field.  You know (simultaneous) (unclear)--
Speaker 2: They had liberties (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --liberties.  Right.  You know, after they come there so long, they get these kind of liberties.  They work in the filling station and that kind of thing.
Story_ID: 55334
Speaker 1: And you all were under arrest?
Speaker 2: We were under arrest.  And it come to that.  I say, oh, this is really some kind of thing.  We called everybody that we knew.  And the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] had lawyers on the case and everything.  And they started telling these people that what you were doing is wrong, you're violating this Articles of War and things that we got here and all these kind of things, and you have to do something about it.  So after about 11 or 12 days--I think it was about 12 days we were down there in Godman Field [Kentucky]--they decided to give us a written reprimand.  So we all got this written reprimand, and we replied, and we told them, you know, about that we thought that everything was wrong and what our position was, how we were in the military and we were good soldiers willing to give up everything that we had for our country.  And so then they shipped us from there--and that reprimand went on our record--to Walterboro, South Carolina, and we went down there; most of the group went down there for another part of the training; and all these things.  The bomber group moved to at least 20 times in over a period of a couple of years in the training.  That's why the training never got to be complete and things.  So then we were shipped down there, and that reprimand stayed in our records for over fifty years.  And when [William] Clinton got to be president, he's the one that put the things through and got some of those things removed from our record.  Clinton also--in World War One and Two, no blacks received the Medal of Honor, which a lot of people don't realize, and up until that time, they received a number of them.  And he gave--for World War Two--he gave about five or six out to people, you know.  I think only one or two people were still living when he did that, the Medal of Honor.  But then we went down to--got on the train, sent us down to Walterboro, South Carolina.  When we got there, they had these two officers clubs, and we went in and the ladies told us that, "We heard you bad guys were coming down here," and we moved all our things at that club out to a country club out somewhere in the wilderness and everything.  So we said, "Fine."  So we were there, they had the club and all those kind of things.  And those kind of things went on, that people had to do with in there.  Guys got on the bus, sit in the front of the bus, and the bus driver wouldn't drive, so he sat there for four or five hours.  The guys did all those kind of things, you know, and just to see what would actually happen and things and they would.  And then we did that, and things went on.
Story_ID: 55335
Speaker 1: So, so what I'm hearing here is that the Tuskegee Airmen, you know, were in a position because of their status to disrupt the segregated lifestyle of a large part of the United States?
Speaker 2: They could.  It got to do with these little small kind of things and every kind of thing, you know.  And that the agitation was going on all the time.  And the thing about it is, is that all these things, nobody knew about them.  See, the only way you found out about the Tuskegee Airmen overseas was the "Pittsburgh Courier," "Chicago Defender," and things like that.  The military, they didn't want to do anything about it at all; no publicity at all.  And when they came back, the fellas found out, what happened is--as I mentioned before about, the bombers would--the fighters would take them bombers into their target, would wait for them, and take them back to their base.  Now some other groups, they'd be waiting for them, and they run out of time, you know, they gone; see, 'cause they don't want to run out of gas.  The guys would wait for them and bring them back.  And they found out, the guy says, "Man," says, "them other units found out that these guys will stay with you all the time."  And like they said in the movie, they wanted them to fly with them, they did, because they never lost a bomber to another fighter aircraft.  And one reason for that was, Bill Davis was a strict disciplinarian.  He said, "Your job, take them in, bring them out.  Don't go out running around trying to be an ace shooting down airplanes."  Say, "That's not your job."  "You don't have to shoot them down, you know, 'cause you shoot them down, somebody else is going to shoot down one of them bombers.  You stay with them."  And that's one reason they got that record.  They stayed with them.  That kind of thing actually happened.  And once they found out about it, because they found out about it--it's this kind of thing, the guys were doing these kind of things and everybody wanted them.  And it was a thing that would help to bring about--that and the Freeman Field thing was the thing that brought about the integration into the Armed Forces, one of the things that really had something of a great deal to do with it.  Because they found out the guys can do everything they were supposed to be able to do.
Story_ID: 55336
Speaker 1: Now, now you mentioned Ben Davis.  Can you tell me--tell us a little about (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: About my Commander Davis?
Speaker 1: (Unclear).
Speaker 2: You know, he went to West Point, and the people didn't talk to him.  He came out here wanting to be in the pilots program.  They told him they didn't have any at that time.  And when they found it--finally got one together, they sent him there, and he was the only officer that was in that training program at that time.  And they made him the commander of the 99th went he went overseas.  And the 99th went overseas, nobody wanted them; went down to Africa, and it's like --
Speaker 1: That's the first group of Tuskegee Airmen?
Speaker 2: Airmen, the 99th that went over.  And they wouldn't honor him in South Africa.  Nobody wanted him, and he flew straight through missions and that kind of thing.  And he did something else that--it's like any other kind of--like a team was something you put together.  You always had a few veterans that come in and school the rookies.  They had nobody to come in and teach them anything at all.  They had to, you know, pick it almost all up on their own.  That's one of the kind of things they had to go through and do, too.  Then they moved them up from--in Africa--up into Italy.
Story_ID: 55337
Speaker 1: You know that, once he got that together and the 2-32nd thing, everything went on fine.  But they had to get word out, because they found out people could do anything they wanted to do.  I tell you another thing that was interesting about getting the guys over and getting things together.  They had the--the guys were from the 99th, they were trained, and they had all the overseas training they were supposed to have.  They were still down at Tuskegee flying, and a number of, especially white ladies, found out about these guys.  They down there marching, and they were saying, "My son is over there getting shot down in Europe, and you got those guys down there, they were qualified fliers and things and just flying around there, jolly and having a good time.  They need to be over there, too.  And they said, "Well, maybe we can get them to control--flight control."  And the lady was saying, "No, no.  They need to be where it was hot and going--things are going on."  Said, "They need to come over there, too."  So that was a beginning to be a pressure that was placed on people too about people getting into combat.
Speaker 2: Racism comes both ways (simultaneous) (unclear)--
Speaker 1: Right.  And surprising sometimes.  Right.  It comes both ways.  And that's the kind of thing that went on.  And that happened.
Speaker 2: So the reputation of the Tuskegee Airmen in terms of combat duty was made basically in Italy.  Right?
Speaker 1: 'Cause they were stationed there, but it was made over in Europe.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Because they flew all the way from out of Italy over Berlin and everything up there; had all kind of missions they flew.  They had missions that lasted eight hours.  See, you think about it a long time for one mission, that little type of thing and (unclear) at that time.  But they put on extra tanks and took the bombers up, and picked them all up there and took them on in.
Story_ID: 55338
Speaker 1: Can you describe the plane that was used basically by the bombers (simultaneous) (unclear)--
Speaker 2: The P-51 was the finest plane that they used, and it's recognized and regarded as the best plane in World War Two.  And the guys still liked the airplane.  It was a sturdy plane, it was fast, maneuverable, and they used it--they shot down the first jets with that.  The Germans had some jets.  They shot down some jets, because the jets--the first jets weren't too maneuverable.  They couldn't make that tight turn.  And these guys found out they could make this tight turn and get inside of them and shoot them down.  So all that was part of it.  And they came in through that.
Speaker 1: Now, these are planes with the red tails?
Speaker 2: Red tails.  That's the way they decorated their plane.  And every group could decorate their plane liked they wanted to.  So they decorated their planes with the red tails, and the guys called them, you know, the Red Tails.  Said "send the Red Tails to them".  And we run into people today that say that, says, "Man, when the Red Tails would come up there, I'd say, 'Thank the Lord,' 'cause I know I'm going to get home tonight."  And some guy said, "Yeah," he says, "I says, I owe you guys something, 'cause," says "my old man told me about them Red Tails." I said, "They got him back home."  Says, "That's the only reason I'm here, 'cause my old man got back."  I said, "You know"--and so, you get all those kind of things from time to time, which is really nice.
Story_ID: 55339
Speaker 1: I heard that sometimes black units in combat were dispersed so that the unit would get credit for an action.  Did you find this to be true?
Speaker 2: Not usually.  Usually it is that they just never--they never just said anything about what was going on.  A lot of things you never heard about.  You didn't even know they were in the military.  You know, you had a--they had a parachute group, Triple Nickel.  And you never heard anything about them, anything like that.  You never heard anything about the first officer of commission, Commissioner for the Navy, the Golden Thirteen at--right up here in Chicago.
Speaker 1: The Great Lakes.
Speaker 2: The Great Lakes.  And they had--it was an interesting thing to me, because when they had their fiftieth anniversary, the commanding officer at Great Lakes was black, and he had a celebration for them on the fiftieth anniversary.  He had about seven of the guys who are still living then, and they came back for that.  So all these kind of things have a way of coming around and things, but you never hear anything about any of these kind of things that goes on.
Speaker 1: Do you know any of the men from the tank battalion that, you know (unclear)--
Speaker 2: No.  I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --some people would cancel a trip in some of the concentration camps (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Concentration--no.    I don't know any of those people.  I haven't ran into any of them.  I ran into the guy from the Navy, some guys from the Marines; I ran into some of them.  A lot of things were going on.
Story_ID: 55340
Speaker 1: So, towards the close of--how long were you in there (simultaneous) (unclear)--
Speaker 2: A little over three years.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Mm-mm.  I wanted to get out to come back and enjoy this good civilian life and everything, which turned out to be a lot of things didn't happen.  Guys were flying-since we had twin-engine planes, they were building up a lot of hours--pilots, flying these planes, because, they said, "I got--flying all these hours, this experience, and I got all these ratings, I can come out and get a job in commercial airline."  And neither one got a job.  One thing's in navigation, since I had all this navigation experience and things, and they took us and introduced us to radar and how radar was working, how it can do all that kind of thing.  I wanted to be an air traffic controller.  I applied for it, and they told me they hadn't established anything for black people being air traffic controllers.  And these are the kind of things that were, you know, were happening when we came out in the mid-forties.
Speaker 1: Other than people like--who stayed in the military as a career, like Daniel "Chappie" James and others, you all found it almost impossible to get a job, you know (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --in the field of (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Right.  Right.  And the guy that did get the jobs flying commercials and that kind of thing, they wanted to use him South America to Africa.  Yeah.  But it didn't happen.  The guy had all kind of hours, all kind of experience.  And it was just, you know, that that had to happen.  And then in--I think it was '49 [1949] when [Harry] Truman--not Truman, but--yeah, Truman, finally integrated the armed forces, when at first they didn't really integrate it, and that kind of thing, and that happened.  And it took a little time for them to get everything together.  But it was a start.
Speaker 1: Why do you think the Armed Forces in the United States was so hard to integrate?  I mean, other things were too apparently, but, you know, why would --
Speaker 2: One reason is that back in the thirties [1930s] and the forties [1940s], when they took a survey of the South, one of the most highly respected thing was a military career.  And in the World War Two, most of your high-ranking officers were Southerner, and they brought their feelings and their beliefs with them.  And that was one of the kind of things that they did, and a lot of them, when they got to be generals and things were staunch racists, you know.  They really didn't believe that--they didn't want people to do anything at all and that kind of thing.  You ran into that.  And that was one of the things in these things that were written about folks, and that particular kind of thing is that, you know, that this idea about having to salute and having to command, and these kind of things, they didn't want to do those kind of things.  They didn't want to get into that.
Story_ID: 55341
Speaker 1: Okay.  So then how did you--give me the memories of how you were (unclear) of our service, or was there anything ceremony involved in it or (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: No.  You just filled all these papers that they had and go in and get all them together, and they can tell you, "Well, you just discharged."  And they put us in the--like, the reserves for a number of years in case anything would happen, they was always available.  And a lot of guys went into the, you know, Air Force Reserves, and that kind of thing, (unclear) and did that on, you know, like, the weekends and things.
Speaker 1: Did you?
Speaker 2: No.  I didn't do that.  So I said, "No."  I didn't get that.  I had quite a few friends who did that.  Turned out to be a good thing for them, too.
Speaker 1: So what did you do after your service was over?
Speaker 2: From the service, after it came over, I got--first thing, I got married, and came back.  And I--the lady that I married was living in Chicago [Illinois] so I came back and that's how I got to be in Chicago.
Speaker 1: Did you meet her in the service?
Speaker 2: No.  No.  I didn't meet her in the service.  And so then I decided to--I got here, like, in November, and they were hiring)--
Speaker 1: This is nineteen forty (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Forty-five [1945].
Speaker 1: Five.
Speaker 2: And I'm looking for a job.  And so they were hiring a lot of substitutes at the Post Office.  So I went down and got a job as a substitute at the Post Office for Christmas.  And they told me, you could take test and get a regular job at the Post Office.  I said, "Well, sir, when I get these things together, let me do this."  So I got me a regular job at the Post--passed the test, got the job; it was a regular job at the Post Office.  And I wanted to go back to school.  So I said, "Well, I'll see about that."  And so I started working at the Post Office and got promoted to be a foreman at the Post Office.  And it was about that time I also finished my school.  I had a leave and I had, you know, about a year and half to go.  And I was working at the Post Office for eight hours.  I worked at nights and going to school in the daytime.  And a couple of semesters I took 12 hours and working the job and got through that.  And when I finished, went and got my degree and things.  I always wanted to go in teaching, so I decided to go in teaching.  So I took the examination for teaching, and when I got there, they told me I could get hired as a teacher, but I had one deficiency.  I didn't have any practice teaching.  They said, but so--they said, "We'll tell you what we'll do for you, though.  If you substitute for one year, we count that as your practice teaching, and then you can get a regular job teaching."  So I did that.  I substituted as a sub for a year, and then I got to get in regular teaching.  So then I went into teaching.  And I stayed in that 'til I retired from that.
Story_ID: 55342
Speaker 1: And where did you teach in?
Speaker 2: I teached in--over in--around 63rd Street, down through there--63rd and Dorchester.  I taught in the elementary school.  And I taught there for close to 25, 30 years.
Speaker 1: What--I'm sorry.  What was the name of the school?
Speaker 2: Carnegie.
Speaker 1: Carnegie.
Speaker 2: Carnegie School.  And at the time, I taught everything from the third grade to the eighth grade and was also a counselor.  And I enjoyed it.  It was really a pleasant experience and thing.  And our school was located in the neighborhood where there was this gang rivalry going on over there.  But the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: In Woodlawn.
Speaker 2: In Woodlawn.  Right.  And the school was off limits.  And the guys that were in charge of the gangs had some brothers and sisters in school, and they made it off limits.  They couldn't wear any gang paraphernalia in the school, no graffiti on the school, and nothing, like, bothering people at all.  So we had no problem with the gangs at all while we were there.  And the school went on extremely well.  And we got to do a lot of, you know, kind of things that I really enjoyed in school.  And it worked out fine.  And at the time--at that time, I was raising a family, and getting along and getting through with that kind of thing.  It worked out.
Speaker 1: How did it feel--how did you feel having such a different background than most people, you know, when they have, I suppose.  That's what I am getting at you (unclear) hearing you give them a (unclear); you've had all this training and you teach at school now, but did it make you feel odd to or did it make you kind of wonder, you know, or feel disrupted in a way to now be doing this?
Speaker 2: You know, a strange thing happened, you know.  And I don't know (unclear).  We got to find a real thing for it now.  When all the guys got out and they started to get their careers established, and most of them had to go to other fields, the Tuskegee Airmen, as a group, we didn't organize, you know, as the Tuskegee Airmen until--it's about thirty years ago.  And so all that time in between, I've known people from the time, like, I got out of the military, they had known me for maybe fifteen years, and they had no idea I was Tuskegee Airman.
Story_ID: 54794
Speaker 1: We were talking about the, I guess, the burden of having gone through all this training and people not recognizing, or the general public not knowing anything about the Tuskegee Airmen at all.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Even as you teach and come into contact with the general public every day, your colleagues have no idea--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --of the significance.  If you told them, they may not even know it.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  'Cause I know that in my case is that I taught with people and worked with them for fifteen years or more, and they had no idea I was a Tuskegee Airmen.  We didn't talk about it, we didn't say anything about it, we didn't do anything about it at all.  And the only people that I was involved with then was the fellas I was in service with, some real good friends and still good friends today.  And we got together until they finally organized, the Tuskegee Airmen, the first meeting we had was in Detroit [Michigan].  And we organized chapters.  They had a small group (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Where was that--I'm sorry.  I want to keep up.  When was that?  What year did you all organize?
Speaker 2: About 30 years ago.  I'm forgetting the actual--'cause we had our 25th anniversary about five or six years ago.
Speaker 1: In the seventies (1970s) then.  Right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, and once that started happening, we got to--people started talking about it more, and people found out about, you know, more about the Tuskegee Airmen and things that were going on.  And it made a great--really great deal of difference.  And then after the movie came out, that helped a great deal too for people to get the idea about the Tuskegee Airmen and the kind of things that they were actually doing in those particular kind of things.
Speaker 1: Now, I believe that was in 1996 and starring Laurence Fishburne, Cuba Gooding, Jr.--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --that was made for HBO?
Speaker 2: HBO.  HBO made that.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: HBO made the movie and that kind of thing through there, and it came out.  And Bob Williams the one that made the movie, but the story, he had it for 40 years before anybody bought it.  And so that happened.  And, but, then once we got the chapters and things started, things started to improve, because we meet every year.  And the chapters, one of the things that they do is going to carry on the legacy.  And they have to have you know the idea and get out and talk to people and do things to help people to find out about the Tuskegee Airmen.
Story_ID: 54795
Speaker 1: How many people really were Tuskegee Airmen?  (unclear).
Speaker 2: That's the question they're asking.  It's hard to answer, because we know--we know how many pilots we had, how many navigators, how many bombardiers, and those kind of things, easy.  But enlisted men coming in and out, like some of our mechanics and other kind of different kind of things.  It took 10 people to keep one airplane in the air.  We have no kind of idea.  It runs up into the thousands that were involved in that.  And everybody would come up with those kind of records and things on that.
Speaker 1: So the whole crew, the whole flight crew, anybody on one of the flight crews is considered a Tuskegee Airmen?
Speaker 2: If they had--that's right.  If you're on a flight crew or had anything to do on the base--like a guy was a cook on the base, or a nurse, or a doctor, anything--all those you had there--the Tuskegee--it's called the Tuskegee Experience.  Even some civilians came--we had some civilian instructors that came in and taught people.  And they have that Tuskegee Experience and we classify them as Tuskegee Airmen, too.
Story_ID: 54796
Speaker 1: Okay.  The first chapter was formed in Detroit [Michigan], you said)--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  That's when they had their first convention, was over in Detroit.  They had a group here in Chicago, had got together on the kind of things on--it was just like a social kind of thing with them.  But that's when the organizing really got structured as a group.  And now we have about 47-odd chapters across the country.
Speaker 1: You mentioned earlier that Coleman Young, the mayor of Detroit (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Detroit.
Speaker 1: --the late Coleman Young.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Coleman Young was a Tuskegee Airmen.  He came through in the bomber group.  And we have our national museum in Detroit [Michigan].  And we established it there while he was mayor.  And when we had the dedication, he came in--he flew in in his helicopter and parked it up on the hill--and the hill--and got in his limousine.  He got about 200 feet to ride in his limousine to come down to where the ceremony was and got out and they send him on in.  And naturally almost all the guys around there knew Coleman Young, because we'd been in service with him.  And he got out with one of his with one his foul kind of greetings to all his boys and everything, and the guys said, "Amazing.  You're the mayor of this city.  You can't be talking like that."  He say, "Oh, these are my boys.  I can talk like I want to talk."  And so, the guys had a good time.  But that's just the way that he was and the way he got things done.  But he was interesting.
Speaker 1: Any other famous Tuskegee Airmen now that most people don't know?
Speaker 2: There is some, not with the kind of national recognition like Coleman Young had and like that kind of thing.  Guys were doing all kinds of things, you know, around the country and things, but they were about the ones who had that kind of publicity.
Story_ID: 54797
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what are the activities of the Tuskegee Airmen, now?  I mean, as a (unclear), you said there were, like, 40--43 chapters, I think.
Speaker 2: Yeah, 40 chapters.  Forty chapters around the country.  And most of the chapters are all involved in doing something with youngsters.  And we consider, naturally, that our chapter here in Chicago [Illinois] is the best chapter of out of the 40.  We say that because we say we're doing more than anybody else.  We have a number of programs that we're involved in now.  One of our first programs we were involved in is the Young Eagles program, where we fly youngsters from seven to seventeen, introductory flight, every month.
Speaker 1: That's the Young Eagles?
Speaker 2: Young Eagles.  And we fly over a hundred every month in our program that we have.  It doesn't cost the youngsters anything at all.  The pilots volunteer the airplane, their time, their gas and everything.  We don't give them anything at all for that.  And we talk to the youngsters, tell them about staying in school, and about the values of an education and things that they can do if they really stay in the program.  We do that with them.  And we have another program.  We have a speaking bureau that we do.  We must do over a hundred speaking engagements in the course of a year.  We have a program that, where we have to teach youngsters how to fly.  We solo youngsters and solo about six youngsters every year in power.  We also have a program where we solo youngster in glider.  We flew about six of those every year in gliders, and they can solo in gliders when they're 14.  They have to be 16 to solo in a power plane.  We do that. We have a program that we take youngsters on, we call the summer camp.  We put them on the bus, we take them to O'Hare, and we take them up to Lewis University 'cause Lewis University has an aviation program.  We take them down to Southern Illinois's Army Base and show them how they refuel airplanes and let them understand if you want to get into the Reserves, the kind of benefits they have; then take then over to Southern Illinois University and stay overnight and show them about the flight programs that they have there.  I get them interested in aviation.  We have a program where we had over a hundred youngsters this year to through an ACT program.  We're trying to raise the scores on the ACT, 'cause we found out that--we're trying to get youngsters to qualify for the academies, especially the Air Force Academy, and they're always looking for minority students.  And they have to get their ACT scores up in the lower twenties; and that's why we had the program for that.  And what we want to do with our program is to start the youngsters out in, like, the eighth or ninth grade and keep them in the program, review it for them every year for the years when they get to be a senior, they'll be able to handle the test.  And by that time, we'll be able to mentor them for those years.  And their grade-point average will be what it needs to be to get into the academy.  It's a good deal for them now in the academy because everything is free and they get a stipend of $750 a month.
Story_ID: 54798
Speaker 1: How are youngsters selected for this?  How are they--can they volunteer for this or are certain schools involved or how (simultaneous) (unclear)--
Speaker 2: In ACT program?  I mean, in the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: In any of the programs?
Speaker 2: The Young Eagles program, any youngster wherever they're from can get--it's a program out of the Experimental Aircraft Association.  They want to fly a million youngsters by the year--of the hundredth year anniversary of flight of the Wright Brothers, and that's, like, in '03 [2003], about in December.  So that's where that program is actually from.  We're just part of that program.  And we fly--we're one of the most active in flying the most number of kids in that program, our chapter is here.  But the ACT program is selected and volunteer.  Kids come in and volunteer and selected.  But we want to make it more selective so we can make sure we can follow these kids through for three or four years.  We have that.  We have what you call a skills program, a life skills program.  We have kids from nine schools in South Shore in Chicago, and we have them every Saturday in this particular program, teaching them about life skills, teaching them about different things in life and also try to bring up some of the skills that they have in school.  And that was our first year of that.  And that's being funded for us--that program being funded for us paying a $190,000 grant for that program.  And one of the things that seems to be successful about it, we haven't had an evaluation for this year yet, but what we think it is, is that we have about 90 kids in the program, and our attendance every Saturday is only about three or four kids are not there.  So that's a tremendous kind of attendance where kids come week after week.  So something must be to be going on.  We're good about that.  And we're happy about that.  And we have a national scholarship.  They have close to $2 million in the scholarship.  We give about 40 scholarships a year national--nationwide for youngsters that want to go into aviation aerospace and those kind of things.  And we're an active part of that.  And we give some local stipends and scholarships to youngsters that are in the city in that.  And we have some other kind of things to do with having a planning stage that we want to get into, and hopefully, we can do that in the next year.
Speaker 1: Have you--have any of the youngsters involved in your program gone on into aviation?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  We have some youngsters that are--have been in our Young Eagles Program.  We start them out in that Young Eagles Program and give them that.  We would take them to Gary and soloed them.  They went on into aviation, and they have been able to come back and fly some kids in our Young Eagles Program.  We have one young lady, she flies for a feeder airline now as a pilot out east in Boston and up in through that area.  And we have some other youngsters that are--we have another youngster, flies for United, and he came through--we sent him, and we soloed him in our program, and he's a pilot for United now.  And we have one young lady that finished at Wendell Phillips.  She was in our program and went through the academy, and she's now a captain.  And I forget what's she's in to now.  But they had been through part of the programs we've been involved in and been able to get into this.  And we have a number of other kids that are in school.
Story_ID: 54799
Speaker 1: Now that raises an interesting point.  Now, what--were there many women involved in the Tuskegee Airmen in the forties [1940s]?  Things have changed a lot since then, but
Speaker 2: No.  Women were involved as nurses and other--like clerical things at the field.  The women were, like, they packed the parachutes and that kind of thing that--those kind of civilian jobs, but--Harmon [Janet Harmon Bragg]--I think it's Harmon, one of the ladies, was a pilot in Chicago.  She wanted--the thing the ladies did with the aviation during World War Two, they ferried airplanes.  She was a pilot, had all kinds of hours, and she taught--she taught some of the folks that were in the Tuskegee Airmen.  And she wanted to ferry airplanes, but it was the same old thing we run into all the time--the race thing.  And they wouldn't let her ferry airplanes.  And that was the only thing the women were doing.  And women were flying all--almost most of the airplanes they had in the military.  They'd ferry them, you know, like, from "Well, you make the plane, maybe it's the basic that you go through and that kind of thing."  And they wouldn't let her do it.
Story_ID: 54800
Speaker 1: Can you talk about some of the sights, sounds, and smells that you remember from your days as a Tuskegee Airmen?
Speaker 2: Well, let's see.  What do we have.  Depends on what part of the country I'm in.  Because, when I was in Texas, the kind of vegetation and the things that they had there --
Speaker 1: (unclear) in the air?
Speaker 2: Yeah, you get that.  And then the airplanes and things, you know, you get the smell of engines; especially engines that use a lot of gas, and the smoke and lot of grease.  You get that kind of smell from all those kind of particular kind of things--and everything.  And then it happens--and you're around it so much you just get used to it and don't think very much of it at all, and coming with everything else that you get into.
Speaker 1: There's nothing like--I guess, there's nothing like flying, you know --
Story_ID: 54801
Speaker 1: Do you have any children?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I have two daughters.  Two daughters and two grandchildren.
Speaker 1: Did they always know or were they always aware that you're a Tuskegee Airman?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  They always were aware of it 'cause some of the stuff is, you know, like around the house and they see it and things; and pictures of me in the goggles and all these kind of things, they'd see that.  And so they knew about it from that.  Well, now is that, one of the things that we've been able--up under the chapters--the Tuskegee Airmen do in the chapters is that, we try to bring in what we call Heritage Members; anybody that's a Heritage Member, we bring them in.  And we bring in new generations, other younger people that are interested in carrying on the legacy.  So now, both daughters are Heritage Members, and my grandsons are Heritage Members, and I have a nephew that was a Heritage Member in the chapter; so they know what's going on in that particular kind of thing.  And that's one of the things that we do.  We're really pushing, and we are in the process now of turning over some of the leadership roles to youngsters so that they'll be able to--the youngsters--to be able to carry on the kind of things that we're doing.
Story_ID: 54802
Speaker 1: What's the state--what opportunities are there for young black people that want to get involved in--as pilots of (unclear) information in the military now?  Now, they were--are there a lot of opportunities now or do you see a decrease in numbers or has the number remained static or (unclear)--?
Speaker 2: The number has not increased like we would like to see it increase because, like, this summer, the pilots for commercial airlines; they got the black airline pilots, and there are maybe a 1,000 to 1,500 of them out of 10,000 pilots.  For one thing is cost, because, I don't know--one of the things that we want to do in a new program we want is not only solo youngsters, we'd take them all the way to a private pilot license.  When you start thinking about taking lessons in a multi-engine airplane and you think about the--just think about the amount of gas that plane burns in an hour, what that cost, then the instruction.  So it becomes very expensive.  And most black people that fly for commercial airlines got their hours and that kind of experience from the military.  And so that's the way that they have to go to do that.  There are some programs that they can get into now, but it is very expensive.  And that's the way they have to go.  You can go to college, get a degree, and then you have to go into commercial airlines and fly, and then transfer over from commercial airlines, in to flying for the commercial once you leave the military.  And that's the kind of thing--and that's one of the kind of things that we're trying to work on, is to not only take them to being--to a private pilot license, which will release some of the cost they would have in college, but take them on past that. And there's quite a few programs.  So the--it's there for them if they want to, you know, go through that particular kind of thing and do it.  And it's just the kind of thing.  'Cause we solo kids and they want to go on and they find a way to go on and, you know, get involved in these things.  Just like I said, the young kid that's flying for United and things, they did that.  He was an instructor for a while, and that kind of things.  He flew charters for a while and all those kind of things to just keep him flying and be able to move on to the next step.
Story_ID: 54803
Speaker 1: Is there anything that we haven't discussed that you think that's important for people to know about the Tuskegee Airmen or about Roy Chappell?
Speaker 2: Let me see.  Just one thing, is that they know that I have a--one thing is, and I would be remiss if didn't--is that my religious side, that I am a religious person.  I've been a religious person all my life from the time my family bought me up in that, and always would, those kind of things.  And I am a member of the church.  I'm very active in my church.  I was a superintendent of the Sunday school for about ten years.  I taught Sunday school for about 20 years; and I've been on the board of trustees at the church I'm at now for 30 or 40 years; and then I've held the office of secretary on that for 15 or 20 years in the particular that I'm in; and involved in the activities with the youngsters there, and involved in the activities with the youngsters in the Tuskegee Airmen; and that's the kind of thing that I really--I really, you know, like to do.  Most of it, when retired from teaching, I was on a local school council board for six years, just staying involved in those kind of things.  So, and that's the kind of thing I'm interested in.  Also one of the other things I'm kind of interested in, I'm interested in gardening.  I like to grow flowers and vegetables and all those kind of things.  I do--like to do that.
Story_ID: 54804
Speaker 1: And that's a lot of--and I've enjoyed my life.  I've enjoyed every phase of my life that I've been in; even in the military when we were going through all these kind of things, there was always something coming up that you had to deal with and that kind of thing.  But I was with the same 30 men for almost a year; seven days a week, we're sleeping in the same building and that kind of thing, and it got to be real close kind of relationships.  And it made a real highlight, you know, for my military career.  And the friendships, I still have from that.
Speaker 2: How does it feel when you get back together?
Speaker 1: Oh, we have a good time.  Have a good time.  There are five of us--the guys--the guys says--say, "Them guys always segregating themselves."  Because there are five of us and we're all married, and when we go to the convention, the table seats ten, time we get there with our wives and we got a table and we're always together for that, and we've stayed in touch all through the years.  And it's quite a thing, you know.  And we go all the way back with all these kind of people and see that.  We know a whole lot about each other, and we know a whole lot of secrets that we keep that are our secrets. That's something.  (unclear).  But we look back now, we get together and we start talking, we says, "I can't believe we did this."  I says, "That's right.  I can't believe we did this either.  Can't even try this kind of stuff."
Speaker 2: Can you tell me a secret?
Speaker 1: Once secret I can tell you is that, you know, when you get that age, you always say you can drink.  And I always remember, everytime you go out there and get you a bottle. So this particular night, me and my buddy, the one in Detroit [Michigan], went out.  We didn't have too money that night, so we bought us a half a pint of some whiskey down in Louisville.  It was called "Flavor of Woodchips."  And so he got (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Say that again?
Speaker 1: It's a liquor and it's flavored with woodchips.
Speaker 2: Woodchips?
Speaker 1: Woodchips.  So I don't ask what this is.  So he took the bottle, and he was drinking a bottle and turned it up and everything and took so long, I said, "Now, don't drink all the whiskey."  Say, "Man, you better--let me get a little sip."  So he passed me the bottle and I turned it up.  That whiskey was so bad that it wouldn't even go down.  I couldn't even swallow that stuff.  And when I finished, he laughed, and I looked at him.  He says, "Man," says, "let's give this stuff away."  So we found an enlisted man coming down the street, say, "Buddy, you want some?  You can have this half-pint of whiskey."  And we gave it to him.  That kind of thing.  And that's something that I've never have--I never liked to drink or anything like that.  Yeah.  But that was--you know, it was just one of those kind of things you get into.  We laugh about that.  Big time.  I mean, we could really handle everything.  But, (simultaneous) (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Woodchip Whiskey?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Yeah.  Woodchip.  I say, you know, "Oh, no."  Say, "What kind of whiskey is this?"  But we liked that.
Story_ID: 54805
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what do you consider, I guess, the legacy of the Tuskegee Airmen?
Speaker 2: The legacy we want to leave is like a growing kind of legacy all the time, that if you believe in yourself, and then you believe and you have a dream, then you're able to carry this out; but you got to believe in yourself.  You got to believe and not let people turn you around.  Because one thing people all the time tell me, say, "I don't know why you want to do that.  Ain't nobody do that kind of stuff.  You can't do that kind of stuff."  But you got to hang in there with your dreams and things, and you can go on.  That's what I tell people about when I tell them I believe I can fly, you know, is that, once you make up your mind, you know, you can see--like, you say, if you can see it, then you can do it.  And that's the kind of things you have to believe.  And that's one thing, you know, that I try to inspire in youngsters all the time; believe in yourself, you know, and do that, and there'll be some kind of way you can get the kind of thing that you want to get.
Story_ID: 54806
Speaker 1: And how would you, Mr. Roy Chappell, want to be remembered?
Speaker 2: A man that was--loved his family, because family to me is extremely important.  And our family--and I'm talking about my entire family--not only my youngsters and my grandkids and things--all of my nieces and nephews and cousins and all those.  We're a relatively tight group.  And be remembered as a man that loved his family, was a good father and was concerned about youngsters being able to achieve the things in life that they want to achieve.
Story_ID: 54807
Speaker 1: Okay.  How many children do you have and how many grandchildren?
Speaker 2: I have two daughters and three grandchildren.  One daughter is an instructor at Yale [University] in the clinical kind of thing up there.  My other daughter is an art teacher here in Chicago.  I have one grandson that's in med school at Howard [University], and the other is a teacher in Washington, D.C.  He's going to grad school.  And my granddaughter just finished her first year at St. John's in New York.  So they're all doing that.  I have just one nephew that's--he went through--my brother programmed him, because when I come back, he'd always call me Lieutenant.  I started calling him Lieutenant.  And so he went into the military, went through the ROTC Program at Michigan, got commissioned, got sent out to North Dakota in those silos and got to be, about that kind of thing.  You know, while he was there, he said there's nothing to do, so he picked up a couple of Masters, and then he was into aerospace, and they sent him down to Cape Canaveral, and he was a space officer down there shooting up things.  And now he has another assignment in [Washington] D.C. with--I forget what it is he's actually--but they sent him overseas.  He's been to Japan, he's been to Russia, he's been to Germany, and all over; and now he's gone over to Germany now for two weeks.  They go over to see that nobody is stealing all their stuff.  They got all these rockets and stuff and how their programs are going, to help them with that.  And it's amazing.  I tell people, I say, "Here's an example.  Kid come out of a small town, and look what's happening to him, all these kind of things I'm looking at, been all these places.  No way in the world a kid ever be able to go all these places.  He's not even 30 years old yet."  And I says, "You know, this is the kind of thing that's offered for you in the military."  And I tell folks--a lot of folks who complain about the military, "Look, the military has more high-tech stuff than anybody in the world."  I say, "That's all you're going to do, training in this high--is learn this new technology and things, so it's a good place to be."
Story_ID: 54808
Speaker 1: Would you advise young men and women today to join the Air Force?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Because, and like I tell kids about going to the academy, I say, "Everything out of the academy doesn't have to do with war.  They teach you everything now that they teach in the other big-time university.  And with all this high technology, you could go in the military and stay in there about nine or ten years and learn this kind of stuff and come back and make between $75, $100,000 a year very easily, because of that kind of technology that you come back with."
Story_ID: 54809
Speaker 1: Okay.  The HistoryMakers' goal is to interview 5,000 people.  We're, I think, at almost--we're almost at 200 now.  What do you think about project?
Speaker 2: I think it's wonderful.  It's something that we need to do more of, and I'm glad they're getting it started now, because just like the--for us, the Park Service is doing the interview, and they're trying to get the people before it's too late because it's not too much time left for the original Tuskegee Airmen.  You know, they need to get all that stuff on tape before they all leave here.  And a lot of other people that we need to know about, they need to be on tape.  We got a lot of folks that's done a lot great things, and we don't have anything on them at all on tape, and that's it, and it's a wonderful kind of thing to do.  I think it's, you know, really great.  And you find out that you see people--you see them as an entertainer or you may see them as a politician.  And that's all you really know about them.  But they got another life that's as surprising and it's wonderful and everything else.  And it makes a lot of difference to find out those things about people.  You say, "Here's a guy.  He's all this kind of stuff, and he likes to go out here and paint on a wall or something," and you know, this kind of thing.  It makes it interesting.
Story_ID: 54810
Speaker 1: Do you have any other hidden talents besides the one you (unclear)?
Speaker 2: I just like to--I like to, you know, fool around in them gardens and grow them flowers and that kind of thing and everything.  And one thing that I found out about me that I didn't realize and, I don' know, I have a hard time realizing is that leadership--I've been the, like, I'm going into almost my tenth year as president of the Tuskegee Airmen chapter here, and they don't want to turn me loose.  I say, "I'm going to quit on you," you know, and everything else.  But--and that's something.  And I was president of my--like, I think, the first thing that happened to me was being captain of the safety patrol; first thing of leadership.  And I didn't--I've never seen it that way.  Same thing when I was in college.  All these kind of things were happening, and I didn't see them as me being a leader, you know, that, here I'm going to lead all these folks to do this kind of thing.  I didn't see that.  It just was something that I was doing.  And it's something, I guess, it's a talent that I have that comes across to people that way.
Speaker 1: Well, it certainly came across to me.  Thank you very much.  And I think that, you know, people will now know more about you and more about the Tuskegee Airmen.
Speaker 2: That's good.  Thank you.  I sure appreciate it, too.  I want to get all the publicity we can get and everything else and get it all out there and see where we can go from there.  Because I tell folks I'm 80 years old, you know how all these things going to get around here.  My daughter tells me I'm 80 and a half (laughs).  My birthday is in September.  She says, "You're 80"--says, "You're you're 80 and a half years old."  I say, "All right.  I'm 80 and a half."

Speaker 2: Okay.  Yeah.  (Unclear) left (unclear).
Speaker 1: Oh.  On the left is my brother William; my sister is in the middle, Emma; and I'm on the right.
Speaker 2: Very good.
Speaker 1: Ready for the next one?
Speaker 2: You can use this if you want.  Yeah, that's fine.  You can always use one of the photos to be a backing for the other photo.  Can you make that level, Larry.  It seems like it's not sitting level on there.
Speaker 1: It's got a little piece of--
Speaker 2: Oh.  Okay.
Speaker 1: --tape underneath it, I guess.
Speaker 2: That's a picture of when I was in high school. That was taken, I think, during my junior year in high school.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Next please.
Speaker 2: That's my pose when I was high school on the track team and during those years.  I don't know--that picture must have been taken in my senior year.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Next.
Speaker 2: That's the flying helmet and the goggles and the jacket that we used when we--like we were in primary, and we were flying in an open cockpit plane.  And you had to have on this kind of protection.  But in the other planes that we flew, too, we had to always have the jacket and the goggles and things.  And that's when I was first in service.
Speaker 1: Do you know what year that was?
Speaker 2: It should have been about from 1944.
Speaker 1: Very good.  Next please.
Speaker 2: And this is a picture where I've received my navigator wings.  So this was taken in the latter part of 1944 or early '45 [1945].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Next.
Speaker 2: That's a recent picture.  That's about--I say more recent, I mean about 6 or 7 years old, that picture was taken.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Next.
Speaker 2: That's similar to the other picture that we used as a picture of me in my dress uniform.  And was--that's back in '45 [1945].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Next please.
Speaker 2: This airplane is what we call our airplane.  It's called the flying billboard.  We use in our Young Eagles Program to fly youngsters.  On one wing we have "Young Eagles."  And the wing on the other side, we have "Tuskegee Airmen," and it's painted with the red tail, that is the kind that was used by the three-thirty-second (3-32nd) during the World War Two.  And it has all the other insignias on there from the war.  And on the tail is our chapter logo that we have.  And just recently, we have another member of our chapter that has an airplane, and it's painted exactly like this.  So now we have two airplanes of this kind, flying billboards.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Next please.
Speaker 2: This is taken at Meigs Field with two youngsters from our Eagles Program that just had their flight.  The young man on the left is holding up his certificate.  Each child that flies receives a certificate when they finish.  The airplane on the--in the background is the first type of airplane that I ever flew; has two wings and that kind of thing, open cockpit.
Speaker 1: Do you remember when this was taken?
Speaker 2: I would say about '97 [1997].
Speaker 1: All right.  Good.
Speaker 2: This is '97' [1997] too.
Speaker 1: This is a picture on our float.  We have a float that's in the Bud Billiken Parade; also, it would be in the Memorial Day parade, the last part of the month and in neighborhood parades.  And it has a P-51 in the front that's over my head.  And one of the things they were doing, we were playing "I Believe I Can Fly," and I was waving my arms like this, and the youngsters along the sideline were doing the same thing.  And we think it's extremely important for the youngsters to have a chance to see the living things that we're talking about and know that these things really still do exist.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Next.
Speaker 1: This--yeah.  Now--this is the airport.  This is taken at O'Hare.  Every year for the last four or five years there's been a essay contest put on by the Aviation Department and the Tuskegee Airmen where they write about blacks in aviation.  And usually I have some words I say at these particular kind of ceremonies.  They start with the youngsters in the sixth, seventh and eighth grade, and ninth grade.  And the first prize is two people can--this year they arranged that three people can fly anywhere in the United States where the airline flies.  And four airlines pick up those--that kind of award for the youngsters.
Speaker 2: Could you explain your decorations (simultaneous) (unclear)--
Speaker 1: Oh.  Around my neck--the medallion around the neck is--we present--these are called the President's Award, and it's presented by the President to members of the chapter that do things that are above and beyond the call of duty that they have.  And since it's a President's Award, and I'm the president, I decided that I was doing something, and I needed to give one to myself for the other group that comes into town.
Speaker 2: (Unclear)?
Speaker 1: The Thunderbirds come in.  And each year when they come in, we always meet with the Thunderbirds and the Blue Angels, and we exchange gifts and talk and have a chance to see the airplanes and all those kind of things.  And we've been doing it now for the last--about the last six years.  And it's a very pleasant kind of thing that we're able to do.
Speaker 2: How many photos are left?
Story_ID: 54812
Speaker 1: I was describing a picture in a magazine.  This picture is from there, and they asked me, "What would you save in a fire if you could save only one thing?"  And I gave it some thought, and I said, "Well, these mean a great deal to me.  So I would save my wings I got when I was commissioned as a navigator."  And my sister pinned them on me.  And that's the thing that I said that I would have saved in a fire.  And it came out to be I was quite surprised the way that picture turned out, and people are, too.  A lot of my friends wanted the picture and everything, and as usual, they always want you to autograph it.
Speaker 2: Go ahead.
Speaker 1: This is one of the things that happens when we meet with the Blue Angels or the Thunderbirds.  We always take a picture together.  And this is with the Blue Angels.  And it's always interesting how they do everything with precision.  And like you see now, how all of them are--they're not really kneeling, they're just going out almost to that position of kneeling.  And when they lined up across and the man said, "Okay.  Position," and all of them went to this position.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Next.
Speaker 1: One of the things we do, you see, I have a medallion in my hand.  One of the things we do every year, we present to the pilot that's flown the most youngsters, a medallion as the Young Eagles Pilot of the Year.  And this particular year, Butch was getting it.  And the thing that is unique about Butch is, Butch's plane carries only one passenger.  And so you can imagine that in a year's time, he carried more than people that had two and--would carry two and three people, because he was at--every time we have a flight and he would stay there from the beginning until the end with his one child, and he ended up with flying the most that particular year.  And he's one of our most faithful pilots in our Young Eagles Program.
Speaker 2: Next, please.
Speaker 1: This is one of our speaking engagements and one of the things we were involved in.  The young--the girl that's on my left is a student at a black college.  And the--we raised money--this is for the United Negro College Fund, a fund-raiser they were having, and we were helping them raise funds for this.  And this is one of the programs that they had and we were speaking there for that.
Speaker 2: Next, please.
Speaker 1: This is one of the programs where we presented youngsters with T-Shirts for being involved in some activities that we had.
Speaker 2: When was this taken?
Speaker 1: I don't know.  They got a date on the back?
Speaker 2: No.  It says 19, but I know it's not 19-something.
Speaker 1: Had to be in the '90s [1990s].  Well, it seems like it'll be later than that.  I don't even remember exactly what year it is.  We repeat these things year after year.  I'd say '95 [1995].
Speaker 2: Okay.  Next, please.
Speaker 1: That's another picture of the float, and you can see that I am in the front up there.  That's where they get a chair for me and stick me up in the front and everything, so if anything happens, it has to come through me.  See.  So.  That's right up there.  But it's--we think it's an extremely nice float, because you see the P-51 at the front and the sign that says "Tuskegee Airmen," and we talk about the thing about believing in yourself--is one of the other banners that we have on the float.
Speaker 2: Very good.  Next.
Speaker 1: Is this what you call a shadowbox?
Speaker 2: This is a picture of--you see the airplane in the back?  That's our billboard airplane.  And you can see that the youngsters are standing behind the wing that says "Tuskegee Airmen," and the wings are up on top.  The Aviation Department put an exhibit up in about 1997 out at O'Hare, and this is one of the pictures that was in that thing, and that's the frame and the box that it was in.  And when they moved the exhibit to--out to the south to the DuSable Museum [of African American History], and this picture was taken there and I was just standing alongside that picture at that time.
Speaker 1: Good.  Next.
Speaker 2: This is a picture from one of the activities from our fund-raiser.  We had one fund-raiser a year, and this particular year, we had to come dressed as somebody else.  And I have--my oldest daughter is an artist, so they decided to make me Mr. Clean.  And this was back about '93 [1993] or '94 [1994]--no.
Speaker 1: Ninety-one [1991].
Speaker 2: Ninety-one [1991].  And that's where the idea I got I'm getting rid of all of my hair.  I shaved it all off for that picture to be Mr. Clean.  And I started to let it grow back, and when it started growing back, they said, "Nah, nah.  You look better without the hair."  So I've been this way ever since.
Speaker 1: Next photo, please.
Speaker 2: This is taken at the airport in one of the programs that we had there with the then-commissioner, Mary Rose Loney, was the Commissioner of Aviation at that time.  That's the picture that we were able to take with her when we were going to present her an award and this is when we presented her a plaque.  She has been very helpful to us and been very good for our chapter.  She's now a consultant on aviation in the city.
Speaker 1: Next, please.
Speaker 2: This is kind of curled (unclear).
Speaker 1: That's a chapter picture of our chapter for this year.
Speaker 2: I'm sorry.
Speaker 1: That's a picture--that's one from this year for our chapter--a chapter picture.  And you can see in the picture that we have a number of not only young people, but we have a number of ladies that belong to our chapter, too.  And they can come in .
Speaker 2: And next.
Speaker 1: This was taken in '95 [1995] or '96 [1996].  But my wife and I were going out on the Spirit of Chicago boat, and we were going to the activities that we had in the convention that we had here in--I think it was '94 [1994].
Speaker 2: Okay.  Could we get your wife's name?
Speaker 1: Lucy.  (Unclear).
Speaker 2: Thank you.  Next.
Speaker 1: Well, that's one of the things I like to do.  I like to fool with flowers and grow plants and grow vegetables and grow anything I can grow.  And this is part of my front yard where we have tulips coming up, and I'm taking care of the tulips in this one.  And they come up and I like the way it looks.  And I just like--I even like pulling weeds, so I'm really--I get a lot out of that.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Next.
Speaker 1: That's at the Mayan Palace in Acapulco.  That's where we've been going for the last few years.  And we like to go there on our vacation because my wife likes to cook, and we can get a room there and it has a kitchen and it has a refrigerator; they have all the pots and pans and a stove.  And so we can cook when we want to cook some snacks and things or we can eat out or we just like to relax and things.  We really enjoy this particular place.
Speaker 2: Next, please.
Speaker 1: This is the last one.
Speaker 2: What is this (unclear)?
Speaker 1: About me on that particular town, and they wanted to know what I thought about the time and especially what I thought about the school system.  And I was telling them that for the school system there is one of the best school systems that I've seen.  And I'm a veteran of 30 years teaching in Chicago schools.  And Chicago schools come--they don't even match up today in what I had when I was in school, because when I was in school, we had a chemistry lab, that everybody had their own drawer, hot and cold running water and gas and everything, like that and everything.  And you could learn to play an instrument.  They'd give you the instrument in your freshman year and you'd keep it until you graduate and all these kind of things.  They had everything you could think of way back then in the high school; all kind of courses and everything else.  It was--I really got a good start in my education from this experience.
Speaker 2: DO you remember which paper this was?
Speaker 1: "Monroe Evening News."
Speaker 2: Okay.  And do you remember the date?
Speaker 1: It's sometime in March of this year, I think.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: It came out in February.  That--the thing came out in February.
Speaker 2: Yes, it's February of 2002.
Speaker 1: Mm-mm.
Speaker 2: All right.  Thank you.
