Speaker 1: Okay.  Sir, what is your occupation?
Speaker 2: I'm, I am a judge on the District of Columbia Court of Appeals.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, you are the Chief Justice, right?
Speaker 2: I am the Chief Justice.
Speaker 1: All right, okay.  And what is today's date?
Speaker 2: Today's date is September 26, 2007.
Speaker 1: All right.  And where are we at the present time?
Speaker 2: In my chambers in the District of Columbia Courthouse.
Story_ID: 101184
Speaker 1: All right.  Now, before we go into depth, there are five lightweight "People Magazine"-ish type questions that management compels me to ask of everyone and they only require a short answer.
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: The first one is do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: Do I have a favorite food?  I, I like anything Cajun.  I am very, very partial to New Orleans spices and New Orleans food.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Probably blue or some variation thereof.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Favorite time--spring.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Probably over the, over the life, over my life, the place I enjoy going to most is Martha's Vineyard [Massachusetts].
Speaker 1: And the last question is do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Well, the phrase I probably use most often and people get tired of hearing around here is, it is what it is, you know.  There's other, there's other sort of motivational or phrases that I, that I use in different circumstances just to get one more is 'cause I'm a sports guy.  I played sports my whole life and sports is very important to me and has been.  And Lou Holtz once said, "Ability is something you have.  Motivation determines what you do with it, but attitude determines how well you do it."  And so, lots of times, I'll talk about that with kids, you know, that God gave you some ability, but it's the motivation that determines what you do with it.  Your own motivation determines what you do with that ability, and ultimately, it's your attitude that determines how well or how successful you'll be.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 101185
Speaker 1: Now, I'm going to ask about your family history.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I'm going to ask about your mother's side of the family, and your father's side, but we'll start with your mother's side.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us.
Speaker 2: Gloria, G-L-O-R-I-A, Simkins, S-I-M-K-I-N-S, Washington.
Speaker 1: All right.  And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: My mom will kill me, 'cause I don't really, I'm not sure about my mother's age.  I mean, I'm not sure about her birthdate.  I'm trying to extrapolate and go back now.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, if you can get us in close to it.
Speaker 2: She's, well, she is around 1929 or '30 [1930] and, and she was born in Greensboro, North Carolina.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now, what do you know about your mother's side of the family?  How far back can you trace the ancestors on that side?
Speaker 2: Actually, I can trace the ancestors back on my mom's side to the mid-1800s.  I think it's, it is still post-Civil War, not pre-Civil War, although there is a book that--a manuscript, a study, a thesis, a book that was done, as part of a master's program, about my mother's family on, on her father's side, on the Simkins' side.  And the, the name of the book is "In My Father's House, There Are Many Mansions" ["In My Father's House Are Many Mansions: Family and Community in Edgefield, South Carolina" by Orville Vernon Burton] and it details the Simkins' family.  And the reason that it's entitled the way it is, is because it details both the history of the white Simkins and the black Simkins who lived in the same town, and the interrelationships between those two families.
Speaker 1: Now, was this ever published or--
Speaker 2: Yes, it's been published.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I happen to have a copy of the book.  So, I have information and from that book, someone who did a, a study--I think the author was from the University of South Carolina [sic, Clemson University, Clemson, South Carolina] who was studying race relations and, and the history of families in South Carolina, and chose my, my mother's family.
Speaker 1: Are there any good stories you can tell us about from those days?
Speaker 2: Well, the book was more of, of a historical thesis.  It really didn't get into much of the story of the relationship, the life.  It sort of was more academic, so it just talked about the relationships and speculated about when there was no records as to how the families interacted because, again, it was a kind of a retrospective study.  And they were just looking sort of at raw data from Edgefield's Bureau of Vital Statistics and Town Hall, and where they lived, and the number of individuals and birth certificates.  And there were, but it was a, you know, from that, that record, and I guess some oral history from that time or some interviews with some of the family members, was able to put together sort of an analysis of the relationships between the two and--
Speaker 1: And this is Edgefield, South Carolina?
Speaker 2: Edgefield, South Carolina, right.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  And that's the famous Edgefield, South Carolina that is--
Speaker 2: Yes, it is.
Speaker 1: --was made famous by a slave author named Linda Brent.  That was her literary name, but her real name [Harriet Ann Jacobs]--I'm trying to think of her real name now, but I can't think of it.  It's a life of a slave girl, it's called or, ["Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl"] yeah--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --but and she talked about working for--she worked for a doctor in Edgefield who chased her around the table, and so, she finally ran away.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: But she didn't get, get fully away, but ended up in an attic.  This is a famous story of--and I can't and I wish I could think of her name right now, so people watching this would know this--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --how to go get this, but it's the life of a slave girl, and Linda Brent is the--
Speaker 2: Well, Edge-, yeah, I have to, I want to get a chance to look at that 'cause it's not something I'm familiar with.  But that story, but it, you know, Edgefield does have a pretty prominent history for such a small little town in South Carolina in terms of some really strong racial hostility, which was not unusual in South Carolina, of course, back in the 1800s and early 1900s.  But, but certainly Edgefield had its share of, of some infamous incidents, I understand.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 101186
Speaker 1: So, so your mother's--
Speaker 2: But that's my, that's on my father, my grandfather's side--the Edgefield [South Carolina].
Speaker 1: On your--
Speaker 2: --my, my mother's--
Speaker 1: Paternal grandfather?
Speaker 2: --my paternal, my maternal grandfather--
Speaker 1: Maternal grandfather, okay.
Speaker 2: --maternal grandfather was, was born in Edgefield--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and his family comes from Edgefield, South Carolina.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: But my maternal grandmother and, ohh, and if you want me to finish on my grandfather, he was a blacksmith, prior to entering in the World War I, you know, be prior to World War I.  He then went to Howard Dental School [Howard University College of Dentistry, Washington, D.C.]--I believe in the early 1900s, maybe 1917, '16 [1916], '17 [1917], '18 [1918], around that time, and graduated from dental school.  And, I guess, turned his interests in blacksmithing into his interest in pulling teeth, as opposed to pulling horseshoes and, and working with metal in that respect.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So and, and lived in Greensboro, and that's when he--I guess, moved to Greensboro and opened up his, his dental practice.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Greensboro, North Carolina.
Speaker 1: All right.  So, any stories from those days?  Now, this is--you got a family that's closely related to a white family.  Is this white family a family of means or a--
Speaker 2: I don't know anything about that family.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, and other than the, other than the treatise, other than the book that was written, I know nothing about them.  You know, there have been, there are members of my family who have more information, not so much--I'm not sure about that family, but have gone back and done some research in, in Edgefield and, and perhaps have a little bit more of a sense of, of what that was like.  I, I only know it from this academic book.  I don't even know how accurate this book is, to be honest with you.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It's a book that, that appears to be scholarly, and but, you know, my grandfather passed away when I was very young.  And so, I knew him, but mostly as a very, very young child.  So, we never had an opportunity to really talk about those things.  And while my mother [Gloria Simkins Washington] and I have had conversations about relatives, my mother didn't know anything about my father's, you know.  I mean, she knew about all his brothers and, and the relationship on the--I guess, the black Simkins side of the family, but never was there a lot of discussion about any relationships or any ties to the, the white Simkins family that might have been that lived in the same community.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I, so we--it wasn't something, it's something that's there that we know there's, according to this document, this treatise, there's, there's a relationship--the extent of it in the, you know, I just really don't know a lot about it.  And we have, and I think there's probably been some members of the family who have had those conversations with perhaps the ancest-, or rel-, the ancestors of--not ancestors, but individuals who were descendants of, of the white Simkins family.  But it's not something that we've really explored, or had a chance to explore yet--something, I hope, one day to look into more.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that book is "Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl"--
Speaker 2: "Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl", okay.
Speaker 1: --by Linda Brent, but that's a, that's like a name she [Harriet Ann Jacobs] made up so people wouldn't track her down, and take her back into slavery.
Speaker 2: Right, interesting.
Speaker 1: So, but I, I know her real name but I can't--I have--that hasn't come to mind yet.
Speaker 2: Right.  (Unclear).
Speaker 1: But it all takes place in Edgefield, South Carolina.  The--now are there any, any traditions about what the family did after the Civil War?  I mean, what did the--
Speaker 2: The family, for the most part, was dispersed--I'd say, from Philadelp-, well, the family, the, the brothers sort of were dispersed and went different ways.  And it was, you know, a couple of sisters stayed in Chicago [Illinois], Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  Some stayed in North Carolina.  You know, interestingly enough, I don't know if any of my, of the Simkins who are my grandfather's generation and before, who stayed in Edgefield, South Carolina.  So, there was no place to go back to, so that, the idea of kind of coming back to Edgefield and, and perhaps family reunions that celebrated that part of our history is not something we did as, you know.  And so, so it's not one that, again, that we've actually fully explored or, or really explored at all.  And I think it's primarily a function of, you know, the ability to travel and, and to get to go and do things.  And they were--many of them were very accomplished, and went and did things and chose not to go back to Edgefield.  But I, I don't know why no one has established a sort of a beachhead in Edgefield.  But because of that, there was really no central place to go back to, to celebrate sort of that history.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That, that--
Speaker 2: There wasn't any ownership but, you know, I'm not aware that.  For example, that was, you know, we owned a large piece of property, sometimes property, or something that galvanizes.  It stays in the family.  People come back--somebody, somebody continues to, to want to support it, and, and pay the taxes and maintain the ownership.  And that sort of is a way of the family coming back into their roots, but I'm not aware of us ever having sort of that--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --that anchor to Edgefield.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 101187
Speaker 1: Now, did your mother [Gloria Simkins Washington] talk about growing up in Greensboro [North Carolina] and what it was like?
Speaker 2: She did a little bit.  When I say that my mom--again, my, my grandfather was probably one of the first, may have been the first black dentist in, in Greensboro or, or one of the first anyway of medical professionals.  And they lived across the, across the street from North Carolina A&T [State] University [Greensboro, North Carolina].  And so, a lot of her growing up was tied up with sort of that functions and 'cause he also taught--my grandfather also taught, so were tied up in, in the life of that university and in the life of, of Greensboro, which, of course, at the time, was a very small and very segregated town.  And so, you know, my--she, she attended Palmer Memorial [Institute, Sedalia, North Carolina], which was a, a kind of a private school, that sort of was a pipeline, I think, to a lot of historical black colleges--a lot of the graduates from Palmer Memorial.  And, but, but I know she, she enjoyed those years and, I think, primarily because she was surrounded by, you know, the intellectual and stimulating experiences that come with being that close to a university and, and being exposed to the things she was exposed to.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.  Now, did you know your grandparents?  Did you--
Speaker 2: I knew my grandmother very well.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We called her Muzzy [ph.]--and my mom's side.  My grandfather, as I said, I knew, and I have, I have these memories of him, but I was very, very young.  Probably I was, I was less than ten years old when he passed, probably close to five or six years old.  So, my memories of him are, are going up to his bedroom in, at their house and, and playing and crawling down the stairs to get away from, 'cause they had a really interesting stairway that went two different ways.  And, and, but he was older, significantly older than my grandmother.  So, even at that point, he was, you know, not young.  I mean, he didn't die young.  He was someone who is, you know, died at, you know, when he's prob-, I think, early 70s, maybe late 60s.  But, again, he was older than my grandmother.  And so, you know, my memories of him were not ones forged out on the playground or throwing things.  It was more in the house and, and much more stories and talking and playing in his room and, and just enjoying being around him.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Well, so, your mother, now, she--did she go to college, too?
Speaker 2: Yes, she went to Bennett College in Greensboro.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And--
Speaker 1: What did she major in?
Speaker 2: She, oh, boy (laughter), that's a good question.  I'm not sure, I'm not sure what she majored in, but she got her master's at AU Center [Atlanta University Center, Atlanta, Georgia] in social work and, ultimately, became the director of social services for a Newark preschool agency.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Newark preschool agency in Newark, New Jersey.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 101188
Speaker 1: What, can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Yes.  My father's name is Eleby, E-L-E-B-Y, Rudolph, R-U-D-O-L-P-H, Washington.
Speaker 1: Now, is there a story behind the name, Eleby? (Unclear).
Speaker 2: You know, it's really interesting.  I don't, I used to, I asked my grandmother, his, his mother, about that--how did he, she come to name him Eleby?  But, of course, her--his father was Eleby.  He's actually Junior, but he doesn't go by it 'cause his dad passed when he was very young.  But, her story is that his father, my grandfather, when he was born, there were a lot of, there was either a town or there was a--the Ellerbee, E.  It was either--there was a name that was more prominent in the community.  And I'm not sure if it was the name of a white family in Florence, South Carolina or a black family, but the name Ellerbee, E-L-L-E-R-B-E-E--I believe it was, was a name that was, as I said, was prominent.  And so, when he was born, my grandfather, his parents, wanted to name him a name that was prominent in the community, and just ended up spelling Ellerbee, Eleby, Eleby.  And, and, and that's how he got the name.
Speaker 1: Okay.  It's like, like, Linda Ellerbee, the newscaster, with a B-E-E at the end?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Right.  And, and so, that's how he got the name.  His mother, my great-grandmother, yeah, my great-grandmother was Mary Washington.  And, and I don't know, but he was the first Eleby.  So it wasn't as though my great-grandfather was named Eleby, so, so I think it was just, you know, that she, she, that was a name that was a prominent name in that area.  And she felt that she wanted to name her son with--give him a prominent name.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, are there any stories from that side of the family?  Oh, where was he born, I'm sorry, where?
Speaker 2: In Florence, South Carolina.
Speaker 1: Florence, South Carolina.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: You know, my, my knowledge of the history of my dad's side goes back to really, and that's on my, my great-grandfather, or my father's, or my paternal grandfather's side--just goes back to knowing the name of his mom, Mary Washington.  There was very little record, there were very few records.  She must have been born right around the time of the Civil War although, according to my dad, she never mentioned being a slave--Mary Washington.  However, that's the first of the Washingtons that we know, that I know of, and my guess is that she was assigned that name as, as many of our ancestors were who were, who were slaves.
Speaker 1: There's a, there's an interesting story.  We interviewed a gentleman in Chicago [Illinois] who talked about how he got the name--his, his family go their name.
Speaker 2: Uh-hum.
Speaker 1: And he said people stood in line.  And he has an interesting story about people asking for Washington because it's the name of George Washington.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And, and they considered him the greatest man in America.  I mean, that's what we were told, so we--everybody wanted to have that name, so a lot of Washingtons.
Speaker 2: And that's, and that's probably, you know, exactly how this happened, or how my--and, and it's interesting because we're not sure.  My dad said that she's, that he doesn't know if that was her name or her married name 'cause he only, you know, all he knew was Mary Washington.  And, and her husband, his great-grandfather, died very, very young.  So, nobody, you know, followed up and knew, and, and don't know whether they were officially married, or what the situation was because, of course, those relationships back then could have been, especially if they were born of relationships developed in, on plantations or in slave situations, you know, may not have had any legal rela-, --legal significance.  But and she may have been the one who asked for the name and was accorded the name, Washington, as opposed to him and, and the relationship.  So, we really don't know.
Story_ID: 101189
Speaker 1: But my, my grandfather [Eleby Washington, Sr.], my dad's father, was also a blacksmith, learned blacksmithery in Charleston [South Carolina] apparently, according to the information I have.  And ultimately, made it, tried, made a go of it sort of in the late 1800s, early 1900s, as a blacksmith and a laborer doing a lot of odd jobs, but passed when he was, he was young.  He was--my grandfather passed when he was fairly young.  He, he, my dad [Eleby Washington, Jr.] was born probably in 19-, 1926, '24 [1924], '26 [1926].  My dad's eighty-four years old.  So, if we do the math, he's probably around that time, 19-, maybe 1924, I'm sorry, something along those lines, '23 [1923], '24 [1924].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And, anyway, he--so, so, his dad passed right after he was born, not too long.  He was maybe three years old.  So, his dad was not an older man when he passed away.  But, you know, my dad credits him with teaching him to, you know, along with his mother, who he gives a lot of credit to also, but, you know, his work ethic.  And I think I get mine from him, but he, he was a, you know, I had these stories about him doing every sort of odd job--from shining shoes, to working at the railroad station pulling, you know, horses and carriages and, and just doing everything, but also part of that was being the blacksmith.  So, he was a skilled laborer.  And my grandmother got her teaching certificate when she was seventeen years old.  So, and that was back in--maybe that was about in 1917 or '18 [1918].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: She had, she had gotten a certificate of teaching, I think, from Claflin College [now Claflin University, Orangeburg, South Carolina] in--
Speaker 2: South Carolina?
Speaker 1: --in Orangeburg, South Carolina.  And so, she was teaching.  She went back and got a, a further degree, perhaps also from Claflin later on, but she was, according to my dad, she was teaching when he was born and--
Speaker 2: Now, what was her name--your--
Speaker 1: Florrie.
Speaker 2: Florrie?
Speaker 1: F-L-O-R-R-I-E, Washington.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Florrie B.--Braley [ph.] was her middle, was her maiden name, but Florrie Washington.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right, so--
Speaker 1: And she was also born in, in Florence, as far as I know.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 101190
Speaker 1: So, did your father [Eleby Washington, Jr.] talk about growing up and what was it like for him?
Speaker 2: Yes, because it was pretty tough.  My dad--my grandfather died when he was very young.  My dad was the only boy.  There were--he had three sisters, right, and he was the youngest.  And so, a lot of the, you know, while he was doted on as the only boy, you know, in a house full of women, he also had, you know, a lot of responsibility that came with being the only male.  And he used to talk about his odd jobs and, you know, I'm not sure, you know, for him--he followed his dad, shining shoes at the, you know, at the, at the, at the train station and doing a lot of odd jobs.  But my dad also, because of the influence of my grandmother [Florrie Washington], who was a, a teacher, was very--excelled academically, as did all of his, his sisters.  Only as a male, he had opportunities they didn't have although they, they all went into, and all became successful teachers or other, you know, pursued other interests, but primarily, in teaching following their mother. He graduated--I think, from high school like fourteen, graduated from college at like eighteen or nineteen years old.  He went to South Carolina State.  And that's where he, he got to North, he got to South Carolina State [University, Orangeburg, South Carolina].  And he was, as I said, he was a, a saxophone player and played in the--I think, they called the Marching 100?  I'm not sure what the--I can't remember exactly the, the name of the band at South Carolina State, but it helped get him in and, and pay for his schooling.  And, and so he graduated college pretty early, and then went off to medical school at Howard [University, Washington, D.C.], and served in the military although stationed in, in England for a while before he came back.
Speaker 1: Does, does he have any good stories from his Harvard Medical School--I mean--
Speaker 2: Howard Medical School [Howard University College of Medicine, Washington, D.C.]?
Speaker 1: Howard Medical School days?
Speaker 2: I'm not sure any that I can repeat.
Speaker 1: Those are the--
Speaker 2: I think he, he sort of circumspected about telling me a lot of stories.  I happened to know a number of his classmates and the, this, the, you know, while they don't come out, come out and tell all the stories about their time at, at the medical school, I know that they shared some interesting times.  Now, of course, it was, it was an interesting time because I think we were, you know, it was coming out of--we were coming out of World War II.  We were in the--Korean conflict, you know, was going on.  They were, they were, you know, they were rushed.  They were getting people into medical school and out to help serve in the military, and to do other things, and it was difficult.  I think at that period of time, a lot of people were starting, having to stop, and to start again.  I think my dad was able to go straight through before he did his medic--'cause he was so much younger before he did his military service.  But I think there were some stops and starts there, and his friendships were fragmented by, you know, people coming and leaving, and coming back.  My, more stories about his, his time at South Carolina State, and his particular affections for a, a woman who actually ended up marrying an individual, a man who became the president of South Carolina State University, and things like that.  But he, he was pretty much a settled person by the time he finished medical school 'cause I think by the time--not too long after he finished medical school, he, he met my mother or married my mother, and that was about it.
Story_ID: 101191
Speaker 1: I was going to ask you if there's a story associated with how your parents met or--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I, I think my dad [Eleby Washington, Jr.] met my mother [Gloria Simkins Washington] at some social that was taking place either in, at Bennett [Greensboro, North Carolina], or some place in North Carolina on, on a visit to see friends.  I'm not exactly sure what, what the circumstances were.  But I do know that after that, he courted her pretty hot and heavy.  And she went away to--well, she did do her master's in Atlanta [Georgia at the AU Center] and they kept in touch and, and, then got married soon thereafter.  So, but I think it was probably a social.  And I think it was related to her time at Bennett, as opposed to having met her before, that it, while she was at Palmer [Memorial Institute, Sedalia, North Carolina] perhaps.  And he was a, a young college student.  Palmer Memorial, she was a young college--and he was a young college student.  That, that, that's also quite possible because I know that he was familiar with the school and, and knew a number of people who came to South Carolina State who went to Palmer.  And, and so, I'm not really sure.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 101192
Speaker 1: What, when, when you think about your parents' personalities, who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: Probably my mother [Gloria Simkins Washington], probably my mother, and that--it's probably genetic and some, in, in large respects, but that I can't explain.  But also, you know, I was the--and I say this, not with any, not because I think it.  It says something bad about the, the particular position in, in your birth order, but, but it may explain some things, you know.  It was sort of like, my brother was the oldest, and certainly was probably much more influenced, and seems, it seems like, I think, from most people's estimations, to be a lot like--well, like my dad [Eleby Washington, Jr.].  I was the second born.  And after I was born, my sister was born, the only girl.  And then my brother, my, my fourth, my third sib-, third--fourth sibling in our family.  My brother, my youngest brother, was the baby.  So you had the oldest, the only girl, and the baby, and then me, number two.  And I think my mom sort of probably protected me a little bit and, and sort of tried to show me a little favoritism because I didn't have any of those other monikers or, or distinctions within the family.  But, but I also think that, you know, we just had a, a real connection.  My dad was just, just a hard worker.  I mean, my dad grew up and, again, grew up, you know, for most of his life, without a father.  And I think he had ideas about what fathers do.  And I think they were great ideas--I mean, they're great, in that he worked, he provided, he was a provider, and the consummate provider.  And so, and, and he, because of his profession, he became a physician and a surgeon.  His hours were very unpredictable, and he worked hard because--and he worked hard, and he worked long hours, and lots of time, worked for barter, as opposed to money if people couldn't afford to pay.  And, but he, so he had to work even harder to support us.  And I think that he left in his mind, that parenting job was left to the mom, and, and his job was to provide.  So, there was, there were a lot of times when he was working and that, you know, he was, because he was working so hard--I guess I should say, you know, we didn't have a lot of time.  He didn't miss any, he didn't miss any major birthdays.  He didn't miss those kinds of things, but, you know, she was primarily responsible for our social development.  And so, I think that probably played a part anyway, in, in my development, a large part of my development.  But, you know, ethics, you know, work ethic and, and sort of my father was very socially conscious and very interested in helping others.  So, I think that--I think a lot of my public service desire to do public service and interest in, in helping others comes from having grown up in an environment where I watched him just, you know, try to take the lead and, and do a lot of things, not only to uplift and help other people individually.  I can't tell how many cakes and fried chickens we had that were cooked for us because we didn't have--people didn't have money to pay his medical bills.  But also, you know, my dad was one who tried to start the first black bank and, and was part of a group starting the first black bank in Newark [New Jersey] because he thought it was important for economic development and African Americans, and did a lot of things on those levels.  So, he was, he was very much a, a community, you know, a quiet community leader.  He wasn't a politician, but was one of the people very important in the church, and in, in the community, and trying to uplift people, and to try to do good things.  But all that bit, he was working a whole lot and so, I think--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --personality-wise, I think probably my mother's nurture, you know, impacted me more, or impacted me in terms of, of how, how you interact with other people.  And so, I look at and probably identify more with her personality than my dad's because I didn't see him around inter-, interacting as much.  So, as I said, he was kind of quiet, but power behind the scenes, but and because he worked so much.  (unclear)
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 101193
Speaker 1: Yeah. Now, he was a general practitioner basically?  Was he--
Speaker 2: No, he was an orthopedic surgeon--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --one of the first black orthopedic surgeons in New Jersey.  In fact, he may have been the first.  And--
Speaker 1: So, did he have--I mean, nowadays, people go to a big HMO or something--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and everything is, you know, but in those days, he just had his separate office--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --where people would come in for--
Speaker 2: Right.  And it was--
Speaker 1: --for different bone problems?
Speaker 2: Right.  My dad, when we were growing up, my earliest memories, of course, were when we were living in Newark, New Jersey.  And his office was attached to our house.  So, you'd walk through the back of our house, through our kitchen, and you'd walk through a door, and you'd be in his office.  And he had a separate entrance off the side of the house for the medical practice.  And people would come there, and he would do almost everything there from setting bones and X-rays.  And, and he didn't offer physical therapy at that time, but he, you know, all the, all the work that an orthopedic surgeon would do, that he could do outside of the hospital, you know, of course, he had his hospital privileges for other things.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 101194
Speaker 1: Now, it's--you said one of your earliest memories is that office, but do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: An earliest childhood memory?  Wow.  Well, earliest childhood, I guess my earliest childhood memory is, was probably my first or second birthday in that house.  My brother and I were born two years, 355 days apart.  We actually--my birthday is December 2nd.  His birthday is December 3rd.  And yet, he was two years, almost three years older, than I was.  And so, my mom used to celebrate our birthdays on the same day.  And my earliest memory of my birthday was that my mom [Gloria Simkins Washington] made the effort to have--we like two different types of icing on our cake.  So, she'd make half the cake with my favorite, which was chocolate icing and yellow cake, and half with his favorite, which I can't remember exactly what it was now, but we'd have this half a cake.  And I remember being my birthday, we'd celebrate in the kitchen.  It would only be family.  My mom, my dad [Eleby Washington, Jr.] would come in out of the office, and perhaps an aunt or an uncle.  And we had a woman who came up from South Carolina who was, who was living with us at the time.  And we, we were all around the kitchen table.  And me being quite upset that I only got half a cake on my birthday, to some degree, but enjoying the fact that my brother and I were there doing, you know, in this, in the setting in this kitchen.  It was the small round table.  And I just, I just have that memory of that cake, with that half a cake, and I can't remember if I was one or probably two.  I can't, I can't imagine I could have this memory at one, but maybe two or three years old.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's the earliest memory of my family all being around and--
Story_ID: 101195
Speaker 1: Now, is there a story as to how your father wound up in Newark [New Jersey] as a--
Speaker 2: My, my dad was--got his residency, had his residency, was--he undertook his residency at Martlin [ph.] Medical Center.  I think it was Martlin in Jersey City [New Jersey].  So, it was just that, that was an opportunity when he came out of medical school.  It was the place that he did his, his residency, and that introduced him to New Jersey.  And then, having practiced in New Jersey through that, and having done his residency there, he decided it was a place that he could stay and should stay.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 101196
Speaker 1: Now, what were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Oh, gosh.  We lived on a corner in Newark, New Jersey.  It was the corner of Madison Avenue and South 11th Street.  And, you know, my earliest memories of, in sights and sounds--it was a quiet, it was almost like, you know, it was, it was between two major thoroughfares that were each a block away--on one side, Clinton Avenue, and on one side, Avon Avenue.  And so, that were those commercial streets.  But our street with Madison Avenue sat between those two.  And it was a very, it was a relatively quiet, tranquil type of a street with a lot of single family homes surrounding us.  And what I remember is my running out in the yard with my friends and across the street.  I had good friends who lived in just about every house.  We knew our neighbors very well and, and climbing on roofs and, and riding bikes, and playing in backyards.  And it was, it was a, it was a, you know, it was a, it was a really comfortable environment.  And it was a lot of, it was--there was a lot of freedom in the environment because everybody knew each other, and it was a pretty close-knit community.
Story_ID: 101197
Speaker 1: Did the community have a name?  Maybe they called it something or certain society (unclear) or--
Speaker 2: You know, it's really interesting, no.  Newark [New Jersey] had a lot of different areas.  It, I, we may have had--they may have been a name for it (unclear), but we weren't known by any name.  For example, in Newark, if you went down--I don't know which direction that would be.  I'd say, it's probably southeast of us.  There was the Weequahic section, and there was the West Side section of town.  And, and there was--oh, my goodness, Vailsburg area or near Vailsburg.  It wasn't Vailsburg area, but there were a number of areas of town.  But we were sort of just Madison Avenue.  We were sort of close to Weequahic, and between Weequahic and West Side.  And, and I don't know--I never knew of, of our area having a particular name.  Mostly kids who grew up in our area went to West Side High School or the Weequahic High School, depending on which side of, you know, of the, of this little area, of this area they lived on, but, no, not really.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, what was, was it mostly a black neighborhood or mixed?
Speaker 2: It was a mixed neighborhood at the time, turning to primarily African American.  I think when I was young--when I'm talking about prior, you know, when I was probably up to twelve years old.  No, actually, up to, yeah, up to ten years old perhaps, it was much more mixed.  And then, probably, you know, clearly in '66 [1966], '67 [1967], when the riots came.  And the riots happened in Newark, the whole, the whole city changed.  And there was a great white flight right after that, and it became predominantly African American in the neighborhood.  But it, but it was a pretty mixed--I would say, probably still predominantly African American, but really close, 55/45, something like that maybe when I was growing up, in the younger days.  And then it, it shifted to significantly African American population right, right around '66 [1966], '67 [1967], as I recall.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 101198
Speaker 1: Now, what was the name of your first school?
Speaker 2: Madison Avenue--oh, my first school?  Well, I went to a, I went to a preschool, whose name I cannot remember, a nursery school--I guess we called it at the time.  I do remember, though, it had a fire engine, an old fire engine in the, in the yard, and that we used to play on and climb on, along with jungle gyms, and things like that.  I cannot remember the name of it, but my first real school was Madison Avenue Junior High School, but it was an elementary and a junior high.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (Unclear).  And it was about six blocks away, straight down Madison Avenue, and so, again, it was a community kind of a school.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, did you have favorite subjects in school?
Speaker 2: I liked all the subjects in, in, when I was in, at that school in elementary and junior, up to junior high school.  I didn't have particularly a favorite subject.  I think I liked math a lot.  And I, you know, but everything else was sort of like--it was the three basic, the basic, the three Rs, reading, writing, and arithmetic.  And so, it wasn't sort of a course of study like history or anything.  Everything was sort of tied up in, in that kind of an environment of teaching of, you know, your reading would be history.  And you'd read about, and you'd have some history lessons, and that would be tied up there in the writing and, and the, and the arithmetic.  It would be whatever you'd do growing up.  And you're learning in the first through sixth, you know, kindergarten through sixth grade, but, but I enjoyed, I enjoyed school generally.  And I had, you know, I enjoyed the social outlet.  I enjoyed my friends, and walking, you know, going down there, and teachers.  So, for the most part, it was a good experience I can remember.  But there was nothing that I had any particular interest in at that time other than, of course, probably sports still I like.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what was your favorite sport?  What sports did you excel in?
Speaker 2: Excel in might be a little strong, but I was pretty good--
Speaker 1: Well, favorite says something--
Speaker 2: I was--my favorite sports was football and basketball growing up and, and, to a lesser degree, baseball, 'cause we didn't really have a lot of fields to play and a lot of space.  We used to play football in the street, and basketball in somebody's backyard.  Baseball was a little tougher just 'cause you needed space.  But I loved football, I loved basketball.
Speaker 1: Did you--
Speaker 2: And then I just took up--when I was about eleven or twelve years old, I took up tennis, and that became my, my favorite sport.
Story_ID: 101199
Speaker 1: And my life just about revolved around my tennis.  I mean, you know, I'd get Christmas, I'd get Christmas presents--everything I'd gotten for Christmas was related to tennis.  I just--because my parents knew how much I enjoyed it, and so I started playing fairly seriously.  And it, there was a program--I think, to open, to introduce African Americans.  You know, Althea Gibson was, had a relationship in New York and, of course, started living in New Jersey after, probably after she retired from competitive tennis.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But--
Speaker 2: Did you ever get a chance to meet her?
Speaker 1: I did--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --I did.  I met her on, on several occasions when I was younger.  In East Orange [New Jersey], she used to play out at the East Orange Country Club.  And we used to go out there--those of us who were, you know, fairly serious junior tennis players, and had an opportunity to, to meet her and to watch her, and to sit down with her for a while.  I don't, I can't recall, although I'm sure I did, probably did hit with her a couple, you know, she hit a couple of balls to us.  But I don't, but nothing that was signi-, of significance--not a lot.  But she, but Newark [New Jersey], the Newark YMCA, my dad [Eleby Washington, Jr.] was involved as he was with the New York Museum and a lot of these other organizations, you know, put together sort of a tennis clay which was like a first in an urban area.  They were trying to introduce tennis to, to folks who lived in, in, you know, the African Americans who lived in, in urban areas.  And, and I was able to take advantage of it.  And my brother even before me, older than I was, was able to participate in those programs.  So, we started to develop a real like, you know, feeling and love for tennis, and, and started playing.  But it was that program, plus my dad who kind of put the rack in our hand, and introduced us to it.  And so, as I said, it became my, my favorite sport, although I continued to play basketball also.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah, special.
Speaker 2: Is there, there are probably more basketball courts in Newark than--
Speaker 1: Than tennis courts?
Speaker 2: --tennis courts, I would guess?
Speaker 1: Yeah, quite a few, quite a few more basketball courts, but there were some tennis courts at the parks, Weequahic Park and other places, but they set up during this, this program.  They actually set up in the gym of the "Y", you know, indoor courts, so that we could have an opportunity--nets, so we could have an opportunity to hit the ball inside and, and have a place to go play.  I was fortunate because I also, you know, we got to spend some summers in Martha's Vineyard [Massachusetts].  And there were tennis courts up there, and a group of people who enjoyed playing tennis.  And so, I had a sort of a core group of people who, who enjoyed playing tennis with me.  And then, one of my very closest friends growing up--his name is Bob Cunningham, and he's a doctor, an--God, he, well, he's a physician in New Jersey, is--his grandmother was a black national champion, going back, Mamu [ph.] Davis.  And she, I believe probably won her championships at, at Wilberforce [University, Wilberforce, Ohio], as I think about it, but anyway, his family--
Speaker 2: Yeah, Wilberforce is a scene of black national tennis championships every year?
Speaker 1: It was--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --for many, many years, Wilberforce was home to the black, the ATA National Championships, American Tennis Association, which was, which was started because, of course, at--we weren't allowed to play in the United States Tennis Association.  And at that time, I think it was known as the United States Lawn Tennis Association, USLTA tournaments.  And so, there was a black circuit and play tournaments all over the country.  But I shouldn't say all over the country--all over the country, but primarily on the East Coast and out to the Midwest.  And so, and crowned a champion every year and so, that family, his grandmother, my friend, Bob Cunningham, and, and his mother were very big tennis players, and they sort of adopted me.  They were friends of the family--both of, but she was a graduate of Howard Medical School [Howard University College of Medicine, Washington, D.C.], as my father was.  And his father was a graduate of Howard Medical School, so we were, you know, the families were close, and they sort of adopted me into their tennis family.  And I started traveling with them and going to tournaments and playing a lot, so that's how I really got into tennis.
Story_ID: 101200
Speaker 1: Okay. Now, did you have any sports heroes growing up?
Speaker 2: I--several, I guess the two biggest sports heroes I had--well, three, and three different sports that I loved--Bill Russell, Arthur Ashe.  And, and when I say growing up with Arthur Ashe, he, he was, he's not a contemporary.  He was not that much older than I was.  When I say that, I mean, he was somebody who, while I was playing tennis, he was at, in, at the height of his, of his tennis prowess.  So, it was somebody that I could see and relate to, but he was still, you know, another generation ahead of me.  And Jim Brown in football, and all of them were strong, strong men, and I think I related to that.  All of them were, of course, winners.  All of them were sort of bigger than life and, and all of them influenced me, but in different ways.  Just Bill Russell, a consummate team player and a, and, and someone who was, you know what--he was, he was a David to Wilt Chamberlain's Goliath.  And I just kind of liked that 'cause I was always sort of the--my stature was always fairly small compared to some of the bigger guys.  But he was, you know, he was somebody who was inspirational because he could always stand up to guys who, you know, stand up to Wilt, and, and, and lead his team to victory, so I always appreciated that.  Arthur was just grace and class and, and he was a tennis star.  And, and for me, as a black tennis player, there weren't very many of us, you know.  I remember walking on the street to Newark [New Jersey] with my little white shorts on, a white shirt on--it was pretty dangerous (laughter), you know, from being picked on and everything.  But Arthur made it okay for, for us to play tennis and to excel at tennis.  And, and, but he was also just such a, just such a well-spoken, just classy, you know, graceful guy, just a, just, you know, I don't know what else to say about him.  And, again, both of them were, were very much, in their own ways, leaders, and moved the Civil Rights Movement.  And, of course, Jim Brown, 'cause he was fierce, fearless, and he dominated a sport of--that was physical and, of course, more than the other two, he was very outspoken.  And that was something, I guess, I admired about him 'cause he was outspoken.  So, I guess, if I had to pick my three biggest sports stars, heroes growing up, it would be those three.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 101201
Speaker 1: Now was, was music a big part of growing up with your father [Eleby Washington, Jr.] being a saxophone player and all that?  Was--
Speaker 2: You know, music, they tried (laughter).  My parents tried.  I--music was important.  My grandmother was an accomplished pianist on my mother [Gloria Simkins Washington]'s side.  My--Muzzy, and played in the church, you know, was the leader of the church choir, and played a lot of piano.  And my mother played and, and so, you know, she wanted us to play.  And I enjoyed and, in fact, and while I was at Madison Avenue Junior High School, we had an orchestra and a dance.  And I actually played the B-flat clarinet and the alto sax.  But when I left that school, the school I went to did not have band or, or instruments, music, musical instrument training, as part of its curriculum.  And so, it--that opportunity went away.  And then I tried to play--you could put it up there--I tried to, to play piano.  My parents wanted me very much to play the piano--my mother.  I don't want to say my parents, but my mother, which my father, of course, supported.  And, and they tried everything but, you know, I was schooled all week and playing sports and what's important to me.  And so, the idea of like Saturday morning, when everybody was running out in the streets in that community that I talked about in Newark [New Jersey], and going in the backyards and having fun, the idea of staying in and practicing, and then taking music lessons, was one that didn't appeal to me.  And they tried everything.  They even bought a jazz pianist in to try because they thought maybe if I had something that had a little more snap and, and rhythm to it, that I would, I would become interested, and I would actually buckle down and play.  Of course, that's a big regret now 'cause I wish I could play.  I mean, I really do.  I sit at my grandmother's piano, which is in my house and, and really wish I could play, and plus, my children then took piano lessons also so--
Story_ID: 101202
Speaker 1: Now, television was--I guess, you were one of the first generations to grow up with TV from the beginning.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So what, did that have a big influence on you, and did you ever see a TV lawyer that you admired (laughter) since you--
Speaker 2: Well, I, I've told the story a lot of times--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --but, yeah--I mean, it did have a big influence.  I think all the shows back there had an influence on sort of your morals.  You, you're kind of what your values--not morals, but your values.  And, you know, and I loved, you know, Paul (unclear) from "Leave it to Beaver" to, you know; the Andy Griffith, you know, to, to, "My Three Sons"; and, you know, talking about, and a, a lot of these, you know, there weren't any black until (unclear) "Julia" and "Room 220"?--I forget.
Speaker 1: Yeah, "Room 220," "Room 222," yeah.
Speaker 2: There was some other show--
Speaker 1: I think, yeah, right.
Speaker 2: --"Room 223" [sic, "Room 222"] or something like that?
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think Bill Cosby had one for a while.
Speaker 2: I can't remember what it was.  And Bill Cosby had one for a while.  Well, of course, he had the one where he was a spy.
Speaker 1: Right, "I Spy."
Speaker 2: "I Spy."
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And so, there wasn't a lot of role models and TV shows, but the values were sort of values that were small town.  And my parents sort of, you know, were values that my parents, you know, wanted us to have in terms of work and school and, you know, and those kinds of things.  So, I remember those and they probably had an influence on me.  I used to watch them all the time.  They had to have some kind of influence on me, but, but in terms of my professional choice, you know, I always wanted to be "Perry Mason."  I figured--what a way to make a living because I, I, Perry Mason, first of all, you know, had Della and, you know, had some investigator.  And, and it always had some really exciting case and, and he would kind of direct this investigation in order to do his, to prepare his case.  But I don't know if you recognized this or and most people who watched it, and then what he would do is he'd go into court, and he'd pick out everybody who had any kind of potential motive to do something, to, to, have committed the crime.  And he'd bring them up on the stand one by one, and he'd just accuse them.  And, and the ones--and then all of them, except one, would always say, no, you're wrong.  And then, he'd get to the one, and that person would just break down on the stand and cry.  And I thought, wow, this is cool, I can do this (laughter).  And so, "Perry Mason" probably was the biggest influence but then, you know, there were a lot of other lawyer shows that came on.  After that kind of reinforced it, but I think that sort of led me down a path to thinking that I might want to be lawyer, although I had a lot of influence to become a medical, a, a doctor, a physician, you know.  My, my dad certainly was, was interested in that happening and I had, you know, some interest there also.
Story_ID: 101203
Speaker 1: Now, did you really think about, you know, which one you wanted to be when you come up in those days?
Speaker 2: Not back then--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --not back then.  I just remembered I liked it, you know, I liked watching the lawyer show.  And thought, yeah, this is, this is kind of cool--not that I could do it, but this is kind of cool.  I kind of liked the show and, and but it introduced me to kind of the, what I thought was the, the profession of law, the legal profession.  I thought that's what all lawyers did, you know.  But, of course, I think, up until I really was able to kind of get out on my own, meaning go to college, did I sort of decide that, that was the way I was gonna--that was the profession I was going to pursue.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, you've had experience a lot of black kids don't have in growing up.  And I've never asked this question before but, but because your father [Eleby Washington, Jr.] was a doctor--I mean, you didn't, I mean, you already--there was somebody you knew that was a doctor--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --you know.  Most, you know, parents say, we want you to grow up to be a doctor or something or a lawyer.
Speaker 2: Right.  And, but the role models weren't there.
Speaker 1: But there, there are no, yeah, they weren't there.
Speaker 2: Right.  No, I had, I had great role models--not only my dad, but I had great role models in the law.  One of the first black judges in New Jersey was my--well, lived down, two down, two doors down, and was a very close friend of the family.  In fact, he was my younger brother's godfather, but he's a, he was a judge, Judge Hazelwood.  I had other judges and other physicians who, you know, my family, you know, my dad associated with.  And, and so, they were around, and they were larger than life, and, and it was real exciting and, and so I did.  I was very fortunate to have those influences in my life early and to, to be able to kind of really relate to them, and not be intimidated by the notion, you know--I mean, it was some-, it was just something that could be done.
Story_ID: 101204
Speaker 1: Okay. Now, you, where did you go to--you went to middle school in the same school, right?
Speaker 2: Well, actually, I left in--we, we had a, for junior high school, I, I went to a, I ended up going to a private school called Newark Academy [Livingston, New Jersey], where my brother was then attending and--
Speaker 1: Now, was that in the city?
Speaker 2: It was at one point, but it moved out to a place called Livingston, New Jersey.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And it moved out, probably around, probably around the time of the riots also--not too long before or after.  I can't remember if it predated or came afterwards, so somewhere between '65 [1965], '66 [1966], '67 [1967], '68 [1968], something along those lines.  And it was a school that had been around since the--I hadn't even been, in the early 1800s or late 1700s.  This is--it was an old line private school.  And, and I went out, and I attended that school through junior high.  And that was always, that was a very interesting--
Speaker 1: Were there many black students there?
Speaker 2: No.  When I was there, there were about nine of us.  And we all sort of lived in Newark--
Speaker 1: Out of--
Speaker 2: --and the rest of the students all lived out in the suburbs.  And the school was way out in the suburbs after that period of time.  Even when it was in Newark, I think a lot of the kids who attended the school came from the suburbs.  But we had a, you know, we knew everybody who lived in Newark and went--all, and that was primarily all the African American kids--students who went there because we used to have a bus that picked us all in the morning.  We were the first ones picked up because we were the furthest away from the school.  And the bus driver would pick us up in the morning, very early, and we'd drive around each of our--each other's homes.  And, and then we'd go out into the suburban areas right around North Irvington and other places, and pick up other students, and then head on out to, out to Livingston where the school was.
Story_ID: 101643
Speaker 1: And so there was only a few, a few of us.
Speaker 2: Nine out of how many?
Speaker 1: Maybe, I want to say, between four and five, 400 maybe.
Speaker 2: Uh-hum.
Speaker 1: It wasn't a large school [Newark Academy, Livingston, New Jersey] but, but it did go from junior high--I think it may have started at even, it may have been larger than that.  To be honest with you, I can't remember how many students were at the school because it actually started--the grade, it started in sixth grade or, or even had a lower school.  So, I didn't go there until sixth or seventh grade.  So, I tried--I don't remember how many kids were in the, the lower school, as opposed to the upper school but, but there were, you know, really--I think about nine of us.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And my brother, one of them, so we had two out of the nine--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --from my family.  And my neighbor that--whose father was a judge, was one of them.  So, that was three, so about one-third came from one block in Newark [New Jersey], and but it was, it was an interesting time out there.  My brother, of course, was ahead of me by three years, and he was playing sports and, and doing pretty well.  He's a, he's a different personality than I am, and I think it was an institution that really suited him.  It probably didn't fit me as well.
Speaker 2: Now, you didn't have to stay on campus, right?
Speaker 1: No, we came home every night.
Speaker 2: You commuted?
Speaker 1: Right.  And it was interesting because we would--both of us played sports.  And there was a late bus. So there was the early bus right after school.  And then those people who played sports stayed, and there was a late bus.  But the late bus wouldn't take us back to Newark.  It would only take us as far as South Orange, New Jersey.  And then, we'd have to take a, a public bus, and then get picked up.  So, it was a, a, it wasn't as convenient for those kids who wanted to play sports who had to go all the way back to Newark.
Speaker 2: Yeah, was it a long trip, a very long trip?
Speaker 1: Not, you know, it, it takes about--if we'd gone straight from our house out there, it would take you about 30 minutes, 30 to 45 minutes--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --something along, depending on traffic.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So, it was about a half hour, 45 minutes west of, of downtown Newark.

Speaker 1: Now, you were a Boy Scout, too, you were saying?
Speaker 2: I was a Boy Scout, yes.  When we lived in Newark [New Jersey], we--I attended Trinity United Methodist Church.  And we had a, a very active scouting program at the church.  And I stayed through Cub Scouts and, and into Boy Scouts.  And I made it up to Life Scout which was, you know, a step short of Eagle, and but it was a, it was a great experience.  My life in Newark really revolved a lot around either school or that, or the church.  The, I was a member of the gospel choir and, and for a time, and we had a really good lead singer.  So, the rest of us who couldn't really sing could stand in the background and move our feet back and forth and, and, and sort of come up with some harmony, and still sounded good because our lead singer was the daughter of a minister and she could really wail.  And, and then I, between gospel choir to youth church and, and scouting, I spent quite a bit of time at, at the church, but and it was great.  It just was a situation where I started going to the private school.  And then, I think, you know, ultimately, the time, this is early, early '60 [1960], you know, mid-'60's [1960s].  And there was a lot of revolutionary fervor in the air.  And leaders and writers, like Imamu Amiri Baraka, you know, were, were asking us to, you know, to check our consciousness and, and to, and we were very much trying to develop sort of this, this black consciousness.  And, and it was being, you know, it was in the media, it was everywhere.  And I think part of that started to pull people away from scouting.  To me, for me, we moved not too long after, you know, I was--we moved out of Newark, and away from the church.  So, I wasn't as able to get to the church as easily for the meetings, which took place, you know, on Saturday morning, when I had other things to do.  And, and so, there were a lot of forces that kind of pulled me away from scouting, although I always enjoyed my experience in scouting.  But a lot of it was kind of a consciousness, just raising period, it was a consciousness raising period, and of course, we were young men.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, now did your--
Speaker 2: And it was the Vietnam War was going on.
Speaker 1: Did--
Story_ID: 101645
Speaker 1: --did your parents, like follow the--I mean, now you were around a lot of black professionals, were they talking about the Civil Rights Movement and what was going on?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, oh, yeah.  I mean, it was, it was, it was foremost in everyone's, you know, mind and in all of the discussions at the dinner table and, and every-, everywhere else.  And, of course, there was the, you know, a lot of the tension, and not really tension, but a lot of the, the discussion, and around the table, sort of broke down generationally with, and, and, and later, and, and, it, broke down generationally amongst the leadership of the black community.  You had, you know, my parents were staunch supporters of [Reverend Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.] and nonviolent movement.  And, and SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee], and then, of course, you had Malcolm X and, and sort of a more, and, and you had the [Black] Panthers, Huey Newton, and Eldridge Cleaver.  And there was a, there was a, there was certainly a lot of tension about the right way to bring about equal justice, and not tension, but a lot of discussion, a lot of different people.
Speaker 1: Now, when you were ten--the March on Washington took place, were, did you, did anybody in your family go to the march?
Speaker 2: My dad [Eleby Washington, Jr.] did.  I didn't, I didn't accompany him, but my dad came down and, and participated in the March on Washington.  And, you know, and I, of course, heard stories and, and, you know, it's been well-documented.  Then it was an exciting time and, of course, right now that probably to this day, the one speech by any order that, that affects me to my very core is, is the Martin Luther King "I Have A Dream" speech.  And that was delivered then, and so I mean that, those images are forever indelibly imprinted in my, my memory and my mind.  And I think about it quite a bit.  So, but for me, again, it was--there was the, the, you know, we were still being challenged as young, kinda, you know, we're not going to wait, we're more militant, you know, kind of ideologies that we're being really--Newark was a hot pit for a lot of those.
Speaker 1: So, well, how, how old were you when you first began aware of Malcolm X or, or Amiri Baraka or--
Speaker 2: I guess I was in junior high school, so probably 196-
Speaker 1: '-4 [1964], '65 [1965]?
Speaker 2: Naw, I wasn't, no, I was, you know, I guess, yeah, '65 [1965], '60 [1960], you know, somewhere around '65 [1965], '65 [1965], '66 [1966].  I, you know, it wasn't somebody that I knew a lot about it and followed the movement or, or followed, you know, because, you know, what I knew about Muslims at that time was mostly--these were gentlemen who are always very nattily dressed, or very dressed, and they sold a lot of bean pies up the street on Avon Avenue.  I mean, I didn't know a lot about what the, the movement was like here in the, in the United States.  And I only knew a little bit about sort of the religious connotations.  It was not a--it was not really, it was much more of an activist organization in my mind than sort of a religion to a large degree.  And they were, again, very nationalistic and that was important to, you know, at that time.  They would all sort of reverberate, you know, all these nationalistic move-, motions, and movements were, were resounding and revolving around us at that time.
Speaker 1: Was there a lot of tension in your family between your brother and yourself and your father about--concerning the--
Speaker 2: No, we used to talk about it.  When I say tension, it was a lot of discussion back and forth about, you know, sort of the impatience of youth and, and the recognition and the understanding and the experience, and how far we've come at least, at even at that point, and, and how effective non-violence had been, but how impatient we were and, and, thinking that perhaps there was a better or more effective way of dealing with the inequality.  But it wasn't, it wasn't tension, like we were rebelling against sort of the values that we had been brought up with.  It was sort of a more intellectual kind of a discussion.  I mean, neither my brother nor I were, you know, while we may have had big Afros and, and pictures of Huey Newton sitting in his chair somewhere around--my brother perhaps more than me, you know, it was not because we, we had, we believed that the non-violence movement was, was bankrupt or anything, and thought it was a waste of time.  I don't think we ever got to that point.  It was just, you know, sort of--well, we need to look at these other things and we need to, you know, there, there is something to be said because there's not a lot of change coming.  It's not coming fast enough for us, and maybe we need to be more supportive of, you know, put more fear of, into the establishment than we have so.
Story_ID: 101646
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, now, now where did you go to high school?  Did you--
Speaker 2: I went to Columbia High School which was in Maplewood, New Jersey.  As I said, at this point we had moved and--
Speaker 1: Now, what precipitated the move?  Was Newark [New Jersey] really--well, it deteriorated pretty bad at one point but--
Speaker 2: It, it deteriorated pretty quickly.  I think my dad [Eleby Washington, Jr.] wanted to protect us.  I think--
Speaker 1: Is that right after the riots [1967 Newark Riots]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we moved not too long right after the riots.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, the riots were like--
Speaker 2: It was not too long after the riots.  I can't--the riots were like '67 [1967]--
Speaker 1: Sixty-seven, '67 [1967] riots?
Speaker 2: Right.  And we may have moved in '69 [1969] (unclear).
Speaker 1: Do you have any memories of the '67 [1967] riots?
Speaker 2: I have memories, but my mom [Gloria Simkins Washington] tells me that they were more fantasy than the reality.  I remember my brother was working in, was working at a playground.  It was in the summer, and he was working as a kind of a, a youth counselor at one of the playgrounds over on Avon Avenue, one of the areas that burnt up pretty badly which was only a few blocks--Springfield Avenue, well, maybe Springfield Avenue.  It was only a little ways away from us.  And, and I remember hearing his stories of, of the police and, and seeing tanks.  And, and, and I have this romantic recollection that, that, that I saw tanks.  My mom says they never came by our house, so I don't--she doesn't know how I saw them 'cause she wouldn't let me go over to Avon and Springfield Avenue.  But I, I, I do recall that there was some very, there was some looting, and some burning over in that area.  And I do believe that it was not too far down the street and I think I did much--but my mother doesn't know this, you know, I did get out and I did get a chance to observe some of those things.  And, you know, it, it was, it was really terrifying.  What was more terrifying was the burning and the looting.  I mean, I wasn't as, you know, the, the tanks and the police and, and all of that because I'd sort of been--I think, pretty much sheltered.  I'd not had a lot of, lot of contact with the police, you know.  Again, I was--didn't have a lot of, sort of bad feelings necessarily about the police and, and, and didn't view them as an enemy necessarily at that point in my life.  I was pretty young, you know.  I was really more scared by the, the violence and the looting and the burning, and probably the images on television, as much as the--what I saw in, on the streets because at that point, I was about thirteen, fourteen years old.  And so, I was really kind of just coming into, you know, my own a little bit, and venturing out. Okay.  So, your father [Eleby Washington, Jr.]--as things started to deteriorate, he moved the family to--where did you go, to, to--
Speaker 1: To Maplewood, New Jersey.
Speaker 2: Maplewood, okay.
Speaker 1: Right.  And, you know, I, I never asked my dad what his motivation was for moving us.  You know, the timing suggests that what I'm telling you is the reason.  There could have been other reasons that he decided to move us at that time, and it might have had something, you know, might have had something to do with his practice.  I just really don't know, but, but that's, that would be my best guess knowing my dad, you know, and knowing what he wanted to do to protect us.
Story_ID: 101647
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, you went to high school in Maplewood?
Speaker 2: In Maplewood, New Jersey.
Speaker 1: Now which one, what was it?
Speaker 2: It was called Columbia High School.
Speaker 1: Columbia, okay.  And, now, were there, did you play sports at Columbia?
Speaker 2: I did.  I played tennis and basketball--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --at Columbia.  And we weren't overly great, had a great tennis team, did very well.  The basketball team we played in, probably the toughest--called the Big Ten Conference with a number of the larger suburban high schools, but that were more sports powerhouses than we.  We never did very well in basketball.  You know, we weren't--never had a really successful season in basketball.  We were competitive but, but I can see the major powers, the Montclair High Schools and the East Orange High Schools, which were the big time sports schools.  We were barely competitive in basketball, and but it, it was a great experience.  I enjoyed it.  We had a school that was, you know, Columbia High School was probably 95 percent white, and it was very much a, another cult-, you know, culturally, it wasn't much different than moving out of Newark Academy [Livingston, New Jersey] and into the school.  Only, it was a public school.  So, economically, it was much more diverse amongst all students, but even primarily, you know, even specifically among the African American students who went there.  And so, that was really a good experience for me at that point in my life because we were, it was very--again, Vietnam [the Vietnam War] was raging, people were talking about the draft.  It was a very volatile time racially in the country.  You know, we were sort of coming out of the period, the mourning of [Reverend Dr.] Martin Luther King, Jr. and, and sort of--this is now in the early '70s [1970s].  And it's a real, it was, again, a very interesting time in terms of race relations, in terms of social consciousness.  And I think that's really--it was in that environment that I really developed much more of my social conscience in wanting to help people and wanting to, to be someone who could affect change and--and I kind of grew out of that fervor in the early '70s [1970s].  And that was--Columbia High School happened to be a hot, a, a breeding ground for antiwar activists, some of whom ultimately ended up at Columbia, and involved in a lot of that antiwar protests that involved some violence.  And, and some of those guys were, you know, a little bit older than I was, but had gone to Columbia High School.  And so, they had a real sort of, again, revolutionary fervor, but it was not limited to racial issues, but it was, and involved the war and a lot of those things--a lot of things Martin Luther King was preaching about also, in terms of where we needed to oppo--, you know, we needed to be involved in nonviolent protest.
Story_ID: 101648
Speaker 1: Now, did you have any specific mentors there or any teachers that really stand out in your mind as models for you?
Speaker 2: You know, there were a number of teachers that I enjoyed.  None of them really--I mean, my role models were, were my, were my parents and, and friends of my, of the family and, and who were really, really involved in a lot of things going on in the community.  One of my closest, my family's, closest friends of my family, was a gentleman named Gus Heningburg, who was a brilliant strategist and very involved in municipal affairs in Newark [New Jersey], but also was, was one of the key architects in helping to try to rebuild Newark and, and do things.  And so, there were a lot of people that I looked to.  I didn't really have a high school teacher that, that sort of inspired me in any particular way 'cause I have enough inspiration in other places.  I did have, you know, there was some--the, the coaches that I played for, you know--maybe my basketball coach, you know, was influenced in other ways in terms of leadership and team, but, but not, not in terms of sort of social conscience or, or intellectual thought on any particular issue.
Story_ID: 101649
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, did you, did you run for class officer or anything or--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I did.  In fact, we pulled a "Putney Swope" my senior year.  We only had, as I said, probably one to two percent of the school was African American.  And yet, a guy named Tim Lee and I ran for president and vice president and both won, and both of us were African American, and it was a very interesting year.
Speaker 1: So, you said, you pulled a "Putney Swope".  Now--
Speaker 2: Yeah, that I think--
Speaker 1: --that's in reference to the 19-, I think, late '50s [1950s] or early '60s [1960s] movie about a black and a member, he's a member--
Speaker 2: Member of--
Speaker 1: --of a board of--
Speaker 2: --board of directors.
Speaker 1: --the ad agencies--
Speaker 2: Yeah, right.
Speaker 1: --who becomes the CEO of--
Speaker 2: Right, 'cause everybody--
Speaker 1: --(unclear).
Speaker 2: --thought that if they voted for him, they'd be the only one voting for him, and that they'd get the one vote that would put them over the top, or something like that, or their vote would then carry the day if they had one other person.  And they all end up voting for him.  And then, now I say that, that, that suggested these people were all--that were not people of goodwill.  I don't know.  I think there was, again, they were caught up in a real sense of wanting to right wrongs and, and I think a lot of--we have, we, both of us, both Tim and I had been very active in the school and sports and other activities.  And I think we had a lot of friends and a lot of support because we were active and, and throughout the school and were known throughout the school.  But there's a part of me that also knows that they probably were supporting us because they were, you know, they were trying to show that they were, you know, that they, you know, they were, you know--I think, trying to prove to themselves as much as to us, that they were prepared for a new, kind of new beginning in race relations and things like that.  So, but it was, but it was very interesting for us to both get elected to the two highest offices in the school that year.  And we had a great first year.
Speaker 1: This is about 1971?
Speaker 2: This is 1971, '72 [1972], yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so.
Speaker 1: So, now did you have a regular prom and all that, too?
Speaker 2: We did have a regular prom.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, yeah, and the, you know, again, the prom went, you know, I have fond memories of the prom because, you know, it was just a great, it was a good, it was really a good year.  It was an exciting, you know, we did a lot of things.  The school was going through a transformation, but that was a physical kind of how the school was organized, transformation.  And, and, you know, we, we were, you know, we were fairly successful sports-wise, and, and, you know, it was just, it was a, it was a good year as I recall and so, I felt pretty good about it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I did a lot, we did a lot of, we did some interesting--we were the first--now I'm not sure what this says about the leadership, although I had a leadership.  The whole council supported this.  But we were the first year that we got rid of exams, final exams for seniors.  Columbia High School [Maplewood, New Jersey] was a school--I think 99 percent of the students went to college.  So, by the time we got to final exams, just about everybody was already admitted into a college.  And the teachers finally relented and, and let us get away without final exams and giving us papers, and maybe just another test, test on the last bit of the materials, so that was the, the legislative success story for the year in student council. Yeah.
Speaker 1: Well, that's pretty good, that's a pretty good accomplishment.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Story_ID: 101650
Speaker 1: So, when you were on the verge of graduation from high school, did you have an idea of what you wanted to pursue, career-wise?
Speaker 2: No, I was still torn, I was, you know, torn between that, that real, you know, I--desire to be a, a social engineer, sort of, you know, be involved in helping, which was again, consistent with what my dad [Eleby Washington, Jr.] had done but much more.  I was, I was much more of wanting to be out front of that issue, as opposed to being sort of behind the scene, working at, you know.  I was, I was much more willing--not much more willing, but much more, you know, much more interested in sort of being on the front line, I think, and working with groups and, and (unclear) primarily antipoverty organizations.  I would work the New York City youth services agency, and, and tried to work with, you know, different groups of young people and, and so, sort of be a part of the antipoverty movement and the anti-, and, and try to uplift as much as many people as I could.  And so, I sort of had leanings in that way, but I was still the son of a doctor.  And still, my brother was going to go to medical school, you know, and he turned out--he, he's an orthopedic surgeon now, like my father was.  And, frankly, he freed me up because once my dad got one orthopedic surgeon, I think he was okay with, with me doing something else, although a lawyer is not what an orthopedic surgeon would want his son to be necessarily.  You never, never thought, you know, other than those, he, he thought highly of lawyers.  But he loved judges and he had good friends who were judges and he, he would draw these distinctions between lawyers and judges in his own mind because he saw lawyers as those individuals who would manufacture malpractice cases against good doctors who had done all they could do to help somebody, and because they hadn't put them together like God--they, that they were somehow negligent in their actions.  And so, he thought lawyers somehow were the reason why people brought these lawsuits, as opposed to these people believing they were wrong.  And, as I told him, as there being doctors who would testify that they hadn't done everything perfectly 'cause I said, without, without another doctor testifying that you, that you didn't do everything right, they could never find you guilt, you know, they could find you negligent of doing anything right.  And then, my father was not talking from personal experience.  I don't remember my dad ever being sued, but and maybe once or twice in, in his career, that it might have happened.  But I don't remember any of them, but, but he was talking more generally about the medical profession and, and his colleagues and friends who had to, had to endure these unreasonable depositions, and take them away from their patients and go to court, and defend themselves when somebody decides to crash a motorcycle into a wall going 80 miles an hour, break every bone in their body, spend 75 hours in a row putting them back together.  And when they're finished, their little pinkie can't straighten up all the way, and they sue you for malpractice.  That was, that was--used the classic sort of a story about why lawyers are bad.  But my dad, I think, ultimately is very proud that, you know, and, and understood, really did understand and appreciated the important role lawyers played as social engineers, and so I think was very supportive.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I did promise him I'd never practice malpractice.  I'd never be a plaintiff's lawyer doing malpractice work but other than that--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 101651
Speaker 1: So, how did you choose Tufts [University, Medford, Massachusetts]?
Speaker 2: Tufts, now that's--I chose Tufts primarily based on a visit and a feeling.  I had--Tufts was one of a number of schools that I was interested in because, see, it was in the area I wanted to go--northeast.  It was a relatively small school, but still had a lot of--it was, I'm trying to think back now.  I'm trying to put myself back in my place I was when I was in high school thinking about these schools.  I think it's because I had heard of it.  I knew somebody who went there who enjoyed it--somebody I'd, who was a tennis player, and who I'd, I'd known for a number of years.  It was in Boston [Massachusetts], a place I was interested in going, and it was, and it had an excellent reputation.  So, sort of, those were the things I was looking, looking for.  And when I went, I don't think I was really focused on Brown [University, Providence, Rhode Island]--I think, I was actually leaning on--I mean, on Tufts.  I think I was actually leaning toward Brown and Wellesley [College, Wellesley, Massachusetts] as sort of my top two choices.  But I went up to visit Tufts, and one of these individuals who I'd known for years, actually knew my family.  I didn't know him that well.  He was supposed to be my host for a weekend.  And my, my mom [Gloria Simkins Washington] had arranged with his mom for me to come up.  And I was a high school--I guess a junior at the time.  I traveled to Boston on my own.  It was a real exciting time for me.  I was sort of really feeling my oats--get up to the campus, go to the dorm, no answer.  I'm walking around the campus--absolutely know nobody except this person, and there's no answer at the door.  I keep going back--no answer.  So, I'm walking around looking quite lost on this campus.  And these two young guys come walking up to me and, and asked me, you know, what was going on?  Was I okay?  Did I need anything?  And they turned out to be two freshmen, African American men, who walked up to me and just kind of befriended me on the street.  I told them the story that I was supposed to be up there for a weekend visit and that this person that I was supposed to stay with, wasn't in the dorm and I couldn't find him.   And they said, oh, yeah, we think he went to visit his girlfriend this weekend or something like that.  So, it means he must have forgotten I was coming, but they took me in and it was a wonderful weekend.  They just inclu--I just became part of their group and their friends.  And I got the greatest and the warmest feeling for the university because of the, the way they reached out to me.
Speaker 1: Now, is this the--did the Africana House have anything to do with this at Tufts?
Speaker 2: No, at this point, no.  This is--although, of course, it was a time when we really kinda, again, this, this, this, it was a period in which we really relied on each other for support and, and, and spent a lot of time together as students.  This was, this was just two guys saw me walking down one of the streets of the campus and came over to me and introduced themselves--Clifton Graves [ph.] and Samuel L. Rapp [ph.], Samuel Rapp, I used to call him Samuel Rapp of the Afro [ph.] Rapper [ph.].  Anyway, he--one of them was from Mississippi, one was from Connecticut.  And, and as I said, they took me in, into their dorm room.  There was a dance that night.  I remember one of them met and took out for the first time this girl that he dated for almost the whole time he was up there who, who was very wonderful.  It was almost a very special moment for him, a big deal, freshman year, to meet this girl and take her out.  And I, I was all part of it.  And I just, I just felt like it was family.  And that's really what convinced me to go to Tufts over the other schools that I'd applied to.
Story_ID: 101214
Speaker 1: Yeah, we were talking off-camera about the Africana House there [Tufts University, Medford, Massachusetts]--
Speaker 2: Uh-hum.
Speaker 1: --and you said you stayed there at least once over the years, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, for one of my years, I did stay there.  I think it was my sophomore year.  I stayed in the house and it was, it was real interesting.  It was a real comfortable place.  It was another--again, it was a place where we planned our cultural activities.  The university, for the most part, was supportive of, of our opportu-, our efforts to sort of expand the, the consciousness of the campus and our own.  It was, you know, with the speakers and, and other things.  And it was a place where we could come together socially and, and from all over the campus--not the just the ones who lived, just the individuals who lived in the house, and have a place where we could discuss, you know, our concerns and just sort of be family.  And it was important to us at that point 'cause, of course, we were this significant minority on the campus.
Story_ID: 101215
Speaker 1: Now, was there any significant interaction between the black students on campus and Roxbury [Boston, Massachusetts], you know, some of the activities going on there 'cause I know this is the age of [Reverend] Jesse [L.] Jackson and Operation PUSH and Operation Breadbasket, and that kind of consciousness about trying to do something to help the, the poor of the community, you know.
Speaker 2: Right.  Both in Jamaica Plains [Boston, Massachusetts] and Roxbury.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.
Speaker 2: But we, yeah, we, we had a number of programs where we'd go down and, and, and engage in any number of activities down there from organizing, you know, I mean, from (unclear), from, from organizing basketball tournaments and opportunities for people to come to bringing them to campus, bring students up to campus, to going down and participating in forums and discussions and, and, in fact, working in some of the Operation Breadbasket, what--I'm not sure if it was Operation Breadbasket or another kind of Boston local organization's offshoot of it.  But, you know, in shelters and other places, and so, we, we were, we were really trying to, to connect with the community 'cause one of the things that you found out quickly if you ever stayed in Boston in the summer was that when Boston's intellectual community let out, when all the students and the professors went away for the summer, there was really not a lot of--wasn't, wasn't, it was not a lot of interaction between universities and the, and the community during the school year.  But there, but there really wasn't any real sense, you know, that people were living right down the street from all these great educational institutions.  And there really wasn't even a sense of what these schools offered and what went on and, and then, what went on in these institutions.  So, you know, trying to bring them a little bit closer to that, and trying to help them to see that they had a future, and possibly right there in their own backyards was, was something we, we tried to do.
Story_ID: 101216
Speaker 1: But we also ran prison programs--I mean, you know, we'd go down and, and interact with the prisoners down in some of the penitentiaries, you know, read with them, play basketball against--sports were always sort of a hook.  You know, we had it really good when I was at Tufts.  We had a really good basketball team.  And it was one of the, you know, periods when it was predominantly African American team.
Speaker 2: Now, you were--I imagine, you were a guard?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Were you the point guard?
Speaker 1: I was.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I was a point guard.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I actually, interestingly enough, played behind Ed Tapscott.  Ed Tapscott is currently a, a coach, or in a personnel position, with the, with the Wizards, Washington Wizards, but he was the general manager, vice president of operations, for the Charlotte Bobcats, and before that, for the New York Knicks.  But Ed's from Washington, D.C., and he and I were roommates actually in my senior year.  He was a year ahead of me and we took care of a dorm, but Ed is a, was at that time, a career leader in assists up at Tufts [University, Medford, Massachusetts] for New England--career leader in assists in New England.  And so, I played behind him at Tufts for a couple of years.  And then, I actually was more focused on tennis when I was up there.  And, and I graduated early, so I ended up not playing basketball after sophomore year.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So, you were at Tufts from--you came out of high school in '71 [1971]?
Speaker 1: Seventy-two [1972].
Speaker 2: Seventy-two [1972]?
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And I graduated from Tufts at '76 [1976].
Story_ID: 101217
Speaker 1: I finished in January, but I graduated with my class.  I stayed on campus and, and worked as a liaison between the athletic department and the admissions office.  And what I did was I would help identify and go and talk to students who were interested, who were--athletic department was interested in because they didn't give athletic scholarships.  So, I would go and explain grant and aid, and I would go and talk about the admissions process and encourage--to talk a little bit about Tufts University, and try to encourage them to apply and, and come to the university.  And I provided information from the admissions office.  So, I sort of worked between the admissions and the, and the athletic department in terms of helping to at least bring in, put in, give information to prospective students, provide information to prospective students.  And I also was a resident manager in one of the dorms, as I said, along with Ed Tapscott, and, and so we were in charge for a dormitory.  So, I stayed up there 'cause I wanted to graduate with my class and walk with my friends as opposed to walking---
Speaker 2: Now, what was your major, what was your major?
Speaker 1: Political science with a minor in economics.
Speaker 2: Political science?  Okay.  Now, were there any teachers there that really stand out and that you remember that you, that you--
Speaker 1: You know, we had a, a, there were a few teachers that I thought, again, were, were very interesting.  I can't really say that, that there was a teacher who sort of was my inspiration or was the main--well, I had a number of teachers who were very good who I--and both in the political science and in the economics departments.  We had a, you know, it was back when the first courses on black politics were being taught.  And so, we had a series of lecturers who came in and, talked to us about the emerging black politic, political force, and, and that we were part of, I guess.  And, and that was, that was very interesting and exciting, but if you ask me to point to one or two that sort of were inspirational to me--I think, again, it was just the whole milieu.  It was a whole environment that we were in, and the kind of a social consciousness, with which we were trying to live our lives, and trying to be really focused on helping others.  And it was sort of helping me to decide kind of what I was interested in, and where I was going to go with my life.  And I think that's when I sort of decided I really did want, I did want to pursue the law because at that point now, I know, I now know more about Thurgood Marshall and, and, and the history of the social engineering non--the legal initiatives that were undertaken to help try to gain equal rights.  And, and so now, I'm even more interested in moving in that direction.  You know, shortly "Brown v. Board [of Education]" [1954] was something that didn't have a great deal of impact on me because they--we weren't in segregated schools in Newark, New Jersey.  And so, and I was living in a relatively integrated neighborhood at the time, so it was a very hot, it was a lot of Jewish families in the neighborhood, and a lot of, you know, a number of African American families in the neighborhood.  And so, I, I didn't have the same--I had a sense of its importance from the discussions.  And I had a sense of, of how this impacted members of my family who were living in other places in the South, and how, you know, and how emotionally it, and what an emotional and meaningful thing it was for my parents and, and others.  But it really wasn't something that, that hit me until I was able, intellectually, to understand and to look back, and see some of the success that had been brought about by, by the legal scholars that, you know, kind of shaped this whole equal rights movement, so.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 101218
Speaker 1: So, how did you end up choosing Columbia [Law School, New York City, New York]?  Columbia is more--well, it's, you know, it's in New York and Harlem, in Harlem and--
Speaker 2: You got it.  Why I, you know, what, what was the big draw for me on Columbia was, one, it was an outstanding, of course, law school.  But, two, it, it was New York City, and what a social environment.  It was an opportunity to, to experience kind of the real impact, at least in my mind, of the practice of law to see how it could actually work.  I'd worked, as I said, youth services agency.  I sort of knew what the New York social services and kind of safety net services were, and what people were doing and to, to help other people.  And I knew what the opportunities were, and so I really was focused, for the most part, on Columbia, to the exclusion of almost every other law school.  I couldn't think of anywhere better to be.  I wanted to get out of Boston [Massachusetts], so the, the law schools in and around Boston area, Boston was a very, very difficult--I think, what heightened the course of my awareness and desire, even more was because even though I hadn't experienced it to a great degree in, in my little community in Newark [New Jersey] in growing up.  Boston, during that time was, of course, a hot bed of racial hostility.  And busing was, was on, and so I, I was the--that, that whole school integration just led to all sorts of reality, you know, reality checks and, and realizations of the heart, of the degree to which people harbored, you know, racial animus.  And I remember, you know, being scared to, you know, you know, we couldn't go in South Boston.  And there were places that you, you know, you just--there was, you were, there's just going to be a violent confrontation if you, if you made into some of those ethnic communities.  And, and it was always amazing to me because, of course, they were talking about integrating South Boston High School [Boston, Massachusetts] and busing students from Roxbury [Boston, Massachusetts].  And the South Boston residents were all up in arms saying it would destroy and would admit--it would, it would lower their academic standards.  Yet at the time, Roxbury High School had something like a 48 percent college entrance rate, and South Boston had like 15.  I mean, they, you know, the, the way they had the conceptions of--or the misconceptions of their, their intellectual and, and superior beings were just incredible.  And, and so, it was hard to deal with it because, you know, you can look at the hard facts, and you can see these guys were growing up, going to these high, going to South Boston High School, ended up in factory jobs.  But they thought it would just destroy their community, and somehow, it was going to undermine their school and the academic integrity of their school.  So, I was ready to get away from that. So, and New York was back closer to home, but it was still the, the world's greatest social environment to, to practice law--
Speaker 1: Okay. Now--
Story_ID: 101219
Speaker 1: Was law school what you expected?  I mean, was it more rigorous than you expected or was it a--
Speaker 2: It was as rigorous as I expected.  You know, again, I think I had more romantic notions because I had this, think--this feeling I was going to get out and do a lot of exciting things.  And, of course, you sort of, you had to get the basics first.  So, you know, I think that there was a--I had to re-, kind of under--I had to learn what, you know, and, and kind of bring my expectations in line with the reality of what law school was.  And then, and the training of your mind, but I'd always could see that there was a, an in-game here that, you know, that this training was all necessary for us, for me to be successful.  So, even though it was rigorous, then it, it was and, you know, it, it wasn't so out of line with what I was expecting.  Yeah, so I was since I--
Speaker 1: So, were there any teachers there that really stood out at--
Speaker 2: Yeah, Kellis [E.] Parker.  Kellis Parker was our only African American professor at the time and what was, what was exciting about Kellis--
Speaker 1: How do you spell his name?  Do you know how to spell it?
Speaker 2: K-E-L-L-I-S.  He's, he's passed away, but Kellis was a cousin of Maceo Parker from James Brown Band which, of course, gave him instant cred, and he played, and he played--I think he played the, the sax.  He played an instrument and he was pretty, and he was really good.  In fact, he had jammed with James Brown, I understand, and his, and his cousin on several occasions.  But he was, you know, he was a powerhouse intellectually, and what he taught us, you know, he, he taught a course, for example, called Remedies.  And in the Remedies course, what he talked about was there's got to be a right for every wrong.  There is, you know, in order to, in order for justice to prevail, there has to be a right.  So, you have to go about deciding what your remedy is before you decide your strategy--what you want to get of this, what is your end-game before you go back and decide what the strategy is for achieving it.  And it was sort of borne out of the Board of--"Brown v. Board [of Education]" [1954] kind of litigation strategy where they put together a whole, you know, "Brown" was a lot of cases.  And, and the, the--what ultimately ended up being "Brown v. Board of Education" and the desegregation of public accommodations and play in public schools especially, started with a lot of little battles, and a lot of places where you started to lay the legal groundwork and the precedent to get you to that point where you could argue in the Supreme Court.  Well, that's sort of Kellis', you know, philosophy on remedies.  You got to figure out where you want to go, then you have to go back to put the legal strategy in place.  And for somebody, again, who was interested in this kind of, you know, initially, especially in, in sort of public service, that was an important lesson.  So he, he stood out, and plus he was somebody who, you know, this was, this was the school that was as, that was, was--I won't say on equal footing with Howard University Law School [Washington, D.C.], but a lot of our, a lot of the leadership of then, of the legal defense fund, the [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] NAACP Legal Defense Fund and the leadership over--instrumental in developing the strategy, the Constance Baker Motleys and others.
Speaker 1: Did Jack Greenberg go there?
Speaker 2: Jack Greenberg--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --was a Columbia Law professor.  And, you know, they worked hand-in-hand with this, you know, the Charles Hamilton Houstons and his, his students.
Speaker 1: That Howard group, yeah.
Speaker 2: (Unclear) that Howard Group.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and Oliver Hill and (unclear).
Speaker 2: And so again, all of the Oliver Hill, so again--
Speaker 1: Spottswood Robinson.
Speaker 2: --Columbia Spottswood Robinson who was, of course, you know, became one of my mentors and one of the people that I looked to, to emulate, when I wanted to become a judge.  I mean, you know, that, that knowing about Spottswood in that--Robinson, and, and how well, how brilliant he was, and well-regarded, was, was always inspirational to me.  So, you know, there's, there's a lot of connection and there's a theme that just kinda carried me through, through the school.  And, and what I want to do and, ultimately, public service, so it was consistent, I think, although I didn't realize it at the time.  I mean, I wanted to go to these places because of these connections, but sort of, and I guess I did realize it, but it was sort of not a, it was not the reason, you know.  There were a lot of reasons I wanted to go to Columbia--the city, the institution, and then what came along with that was the history and the opportunity.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, is there any particular course that you remember that had--
Speaker 2: Oh, a number of them, but besides Remedies, it was Constitutional Law, was a very interesting and exciting.  Legal Method, that was the, it was, it was probably the most impactful course I took initially because it was the course that, that was offered.  It was, it was the only course taught for the first two weeks of school.  It was the only thing and it was, it was focused on, on helping us.  And I didn't come from a family of lawyers and who had grown up talking about the development of the law and how do you synthesize cases.  How do you understand how cases are, case laws develop, common law and statutes, and where do you go.  So, it was the course that kind of introduced me to the practice of finding information which is sort of a lawyer stock and trade, being able to find the answer and divine it, and understanding and analyze it by looking at the cases and synthesizing them, and seeing how the law is developing, so that was pretty impactful.  But, again, it was the first course I had.  But also, the Con Law course, of course, because of the significance of, of that constitutional interpretation on rights and protections.  And, of course, Remedies, as I talked about with Kellis [Parker] because of the strategies that, that sort of helped me to crystalize ideas and thoughts about, about how I, how lawyers strategize to achieve goals.
Story_ID: 101220
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So.
Speaker 1: So, you come out when, '79 [1979]?
Speaker 2: Came out in '79 [1979].
Speaker 1: Yeah, and now, you ended up going to Texas, right?
Speaker 2: Going to Texas.
Speaker 1: Now, how did that happen?  How did that come about?
Speaker 2: Going to Texas was a combination, again, of--I think, fortu--it's almost like Tufts [University, Medford, Massachusetts], the Tufts situation.  I was looking to--I think, my ego was such that the practice of law in, in an institution where I would be sort of carrying somebody's bag for a lot of years didn't appeal to me.  And Columbia [Law School, New York City, New York] didn't have a real big public service sort of out of, right out of law school, track.  It didn't--there weren't a, you know, a lot of jobs where you could walk in and, and, you know, opportunity to meet with the leadership of these legal aid organizations and others.  And, and, frankly, I wanted to get experience trying cases 'cause I went back kinda to Perry Mason.  I still had in the back of my mind this, this notion that I was going to be a great trial lawyer.  And one of the firms that came up to interview was Fulbright & Jaworski.  And a black partner, the only black partner, Marty Wickliff [A. Martin Wickliff, Jr.], and he and I started talking and hit it off the bat, right off the bat.  And Fulbright & Jaworski was a preeminent, preeminent litigation firm, was Leon Jaworski's firm, the Watergate prosecutor and--
Speaker 1: Yeah, Leon Jaworski, for those looking at this in the future, was appointed special prosecutor by the, by Congress--I guess, to investigate Watergate--
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: --and was actually fired by the president.  They called it Bloody--
Speaker 2: (Unclear).
Speaker 1: What did they call it?  Was it?
Speaker 2: Bloody, Bloody Tuesday, no, Bloody--I forget what they called it, Bloody Sunday [sic, Saturday Night Massacre].
Speaker 1: Sunday, was it Sunday?
Speaker 2: I forget what they called it--
Speaker 1: Sunday, was it Sunday?
Speaker 2: --Bloody Sunday--
Speaker 1: --Sunday, yeah.
Speaker 2: --Bloody Sunday.
Speaker 1: --Bloody Sunday, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And, and he was, but it, but for me, I mean that was, that was a draw.  And, in fact, my--I was petitioned, my petition for membership in the bar of the United States Supreme Court was signed by--my application as my sponsor was signed by Leon Jaworski.  So, you know, there was, you know, I had developed sort of a pretty good relationship with him in the few years here.
Speaker 1: Well, Saturday Night Massacre--
Speaker 2: Saturday Night Massacre, that's what it was--
Speaker 1: That's what they call it.  That's what it was--
Speaker 2: --not Bloody Sunday.
Speaker 1: --Saturday Night Massacre.
Speaker 2: That's right, that's what I was thinking.  Bloody Sunday sounded something like it.
Speaker 1: When [President Richard] Nixon, when they started getting too close, they just fired him.
Speaker 2: That's right, that's exactly right.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And so, anyway, we, we--it was a preeminent litigation firm.  And they offered a litigation training program that was just outstanding 'cause, unlike the New York firms and New Jersey firms for the most part that were well-established, old-line firms, even though this was a very well-established firm, it had been around for many, many years.  The, the practice was for young associates to come in and, and really focus a lot on research and, and research and support of, of the senior associates and partners who would actually go out and be engaged with clients and, and in the courtroom, whereas at Fulbright & Jaworski, they were interested in developing trial lawyers.  And they wanted you in the courtroom as soon as possible and, of course, with my ego and my kinda dream, that, that appealed to me.  And I, I went to Fulbright & Jaworski with the idea of becoming a litigator, and did go through the litigation training program and, and immediately started trying some cases.  And, and so, it was a great experience for me because it helped me to, to realize that, that dream and that goal of, of sort of earlier than probably I would have, had I joined a law firm in New York or New Jersey, or joined another organization that was well-established in New York or New Jersey.
Story_ID: 101221
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, that's a good reason to go to Texas, so to really get involved right away and not, not just carry somebody's briefcase back and forth.
Speaker 2: Right.  And it was a boomtown at the time.  Also, you have to remember this is the late '70s [1970s], and Houston [Texas] was the boomtown.  Oil money was flowing.  They were, you know, frankly, it was a, you know, they were building.  You know, I had a nice condo with swimming pool and tennis courts.  I could play tennis all, I could play tennis every day outside--to me, which was a draw, you know, 'cause I enjoyed playing tennis, and I liked being in warmer weather.  It was a little bit hard being so far away from my family, but I was ready for a new adventure and that was, it was a good, good opportunity.  And, and, then I was, you know, as I said, a good firm.  And, and the gentleman, Marty Wickliff [A. Martin Wickliff, Jr.], who was a Houstonian, you know, quickly involved me in the Houston community.  And so, I very--I became very comfortable in the community and that, you know, made the experience even better.
Story_ID: 101222
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, now you were there until 1983 now.  Were you involved--was there any case there that you were involved in that you really won a (unclear) or--
Speaker 2: You know, my practice beyond a lot of, initially, some insurance defense work, I first started focusing my practice on labor and employment law.  And, of course, in the labor and employment area down in Texas, which was a right-to-work state, it was a really, you know, my mix of cases really were fair employment practice cases and some labor cases.  And I represented companies in fair employment practice cases.  And that's--Marty Wickliff [A. Martin Wickliff, Jr.] and I were both practicing labor at that time.  And--
Speaker 1: So how do you--let's ask just, just--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --to go back and so, what we're saying right-to-work, that means that there are no unions and the big oil companies that employ all these people, and all the people that claim they're trying to keep illegal aliens out and all this sort of thing, they're utilizing as cheap a labor as possible--I guess you'd say--
Speaker 2: They, they, there are--
Speaker 1: --without benefit?
Speaker 2: --there were a lot of them doing that.  There were, there were some unions.  But for the most part, you could engage in antiunion activities with impunity if you wanted to.  You know, there was no, none of this sort of, even though National Labor Relations Board [NLRB] was, was looking at them.  You did not, you know, you did not have to join the union to work for a company.  And so, unions were--
Speaker 1: So, so even if it was mostly, it had mostly union employees, you could work there and not pay union dues--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and not--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so, so, but, but it was also, as I said, it was the, it [Houston, Texas] was the boomtown.  And, and people were moving in from the Northeast, a lot of Californians, a lot of Louisianans, you know, look for folks from Louisiana, a lot of folks from Detroit [Michigan] and Chicago [Illinois].  It was like, it was, it was, it was the, it was the magnet.  And, and with that, came different values and different beliefs.  And it was a very, you know, interesting and exciting and sort of volatile time, and they--in, in employment relations.  But what I found was that because everybody was making money--what they wanted was, was not to be engaged, not to be spend-, not to be spending a lot of their time from the employers' perspective fighting lawsuits and engaging in bad conduct just for the sake of engaging in bad conduct 'cause it hurt their bottom line.  And they were, you know, green was the most overwhelming or powerful color going on in, in Texas at the time.  And what I also found was, as a black lawyer, as an African American lawyer in Texas at that time, that when I, with, with Fulbright & Jaworski behind me, that name behind me, when I walked into an office, be it Exxon, Exxon, or grocery supply company, you know, I walked in with a great deal of, of credibility.  And when I, and I would go, and I'd meet with the CEOs and if I said, your front line supervisors are racists, and they're engaged in conduct which is, which is indefensible, and you need to change your policies, there wasn't a lot of opposition.  Nobody fought me on those things.  I think there was a sense that here's an African American lawyer telling me that my fair employment practices are suspect, and I don't need to have this hassle.  I don't want to be embroiled in bad public relations lawsuits.  And he's telling me, we need to change things, and I was sensitive to those things.  And, and so, I think that, that while I started out thinking that this was going to be something that was, that just completely counter to everything I had been building up for, too.  You know, I was--here I was, going to go in and represent some companies who were engaged in employment, employment practices, that discriminated, and I was going to be the lawyer for that company.  The fact of the matter is I, I was able to do so much more to change those companies from the inside than any lawsuit would have done from the outside.  And there were a lot of, there were a lot of--not a lot, but there were some significantly and brilliant, significant and brilliant lawyers, who were bringing the lawsuits and challenging these companies that, that got me involved from the company's perspective.  One Gabrielle Kirk McDonald [HM], a lawsuit against the grocery supply company, she ended up being--she's from Houston, Texas--was a Federal, she was appointed to be a Federal District Judge and, ultimately, was at The Hague in the International Court of--at The Hague, the International Court of Justice in the War Tribunal.  A black woman, Gabrielle Kirk McDonald, and her husband were both plaintiffs' lawyers who brought a number of discrimination cases.  And we had a great relationship, and we worked, you know, she did what she needed to do, and I was able to do what I needed to do to, to defend the company and get the company to do the, you know, to, to right wrongs if they were wrongs.  Now, sometimes there were, you know, sometimes the company wasn't wrong.  It wasn't always the case that there was discrimination.  But, clearly, if I went in and my investigation showed that there was some unequal treatment or disparate treatment or disparate impact to policies, their policies, you know, I was, you know, I was able to, to effectuate change.  And so, from that perspective, in those kind of cases, I think that I learned quite a bit about not--now going from working outside this, outside the power structure, sort of as a, a social engineer, and trying to make change to working inside the--and, and seeing that change can be effective if--from the inside.
Story_ID: 101223
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, I guess, 198-, was it '83 [1983]--
Speaker 2: Eighty-three [1983].
Speaker 1: --that you started working for--
Speaker 2: Mike Andrews [Michael A. Andrews].
Speaker 1: --the Congressman?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And that, another thing, another benefit afforded me by going to Texas, was that I was able to get--I was always involved in the community again.  And getting involved in the community had me getting involved in politics and the life of the city in, in Houston, Texas.  And after 1980 redistricting, like based on the new census numbers, Houston gained an extra congressional seat.  And I had met this lawyer, Mike Andrews, he was a partner in another firm, but very much a social progressive, while somewhat fiscally conservative, but a good candidate for Texas, but somebody who I felt very good about.
Story_ID: 101345
Speaker 1: Okay, 1983, you're working for Congressman Michael Allen Andrews--
Speaker 2: Uh-hum.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So he was just elected, you know--
Speaker 2: He--
Speaker 1: --in '83 [1983], the Congress?
Speaker 2: Right, right.  And I had worked on his campaign.  And it was a real interesting campaign because the district that was carved out was a sort of a new district.  And it went all the way from, and incorporated the medical center, one of the most, with Rice University [Houston, Texas] and a very, very prominent part of Old Houston through southwest, down by the oil refineries in Pasadena, Texas, and actually right next, by the [Ku Klux] Klan office in, in Pasadena, Texas which had a big billboard out front, proclaiming there to be the Klan office, you know.  And, and I would, have to work, this whole district during the election, I would go and speak in different, to different groups on his behalf, and I didn't go to--
Speaker 1: Now, is this a predominantly white district?
Speaker 2: It is a very mixed district, but predominantly white, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It, it was a, a district that went contiguously to Mickey Leland's old district, now Sheila Jackson Lee's district.  And so, there was a, you know, because of, of the, the desire to, to have a broad representation, of course, a lot of those communities that originally who I've--that, that were part of that district, we, you know, they, they made, remained in that district, so that that district remained the majority, majority African American district.  But a lot of the--right outside that district, there were a lot of, you know, African Americans and other minorities.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And--
Speaker 2: So we had, we had a, we had a good cross-section, but it was a relatively conservative, still, district.
Speaker 1: Now, have did you get involved with Congressman Andrews?
Speaker 2: I knew him from, you know, just the events around the city.  And we were together when he first made his decision that he wanted to seek this office and asked me if I would be, if I would help him, 'cause we had worked together on other matters.  And he, and I, know, knowing him and felt very comfortable with him, and said yes, 'cause, again, for me, it was getting in the middle of the community, and getting in the middle of becoming much more part of the Houston scene.  And, and that was important to me.  I liked to be part of the community I live in and which is, you know, sort of explains a lot about why and what I did when I was in, in growing up in, in Massachusetts and in, in Boston [Massachusetts], and in New York.  And, and this was another job opportunity.  And, at that time, I was just helping him.  He was a--I thought he was a right-thinking, very socially progressive, fair-minded person, and but perfect for the district 'cause he was a bit fiscally conservative.  And so, somebody like that--I thought would have a chance to be elected.  And he was also very young-looking for his age and had sort of a [John F.] Kennedy-like mystique in my own mind because he was, you know, the fair-haired, and just a, but just a, you know, very nice kind of guy--home, down-home, you know, just salt of the earth, but, but very bright, very, very bright guy.  So, you know, I, I thought he, he sort of had all the qualities of, of someone who would be a good congressman and someone who could win that election.  And, and he did.  And that was a, you know, it was a great thing.  But again, I was, I have to admit I was a bit shocked when then, he asked me to be his Legislative Director and Counsel here in Washington [D.C.].  And I didn't--I had only been in Houston now three years, a little over three and a half years.  And I was so, you know, you know, really becoming a part of that community.  And I was really torn on whether to take the opportunity.
Story_ID: 101346
Speaker 1: Now were you married then with children or anything?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, I was really interested in, in, continuing my progression in Houston [Texas] and becoming part of the community.  But at the same time, it was exciting--this opportunity.  And my managing partner of the firm [Fulbright & Jaworski] at the time, his name was Gibson Gayle, called me in.  And, apparently, Mike Andrews [Michael A. Andrews] had, had a conversation with him and informed him that he had asked me to come.  And he called me in and he said, listen, you know, we, we think a lot of you here.  But we think you would be crazy to pass up this opportunity, and you don't have to worry because if you want to come back to Houston, you'll always have a job here.  So you don't lose anything, but we think you're going to catch Potomac Fever because it's going to be closer to home.  And we think that Washington [D.C.] is going to be an exciting place for somebody like you.  Your, your family's from, you know, between the Carolinas and New Jersey, you'll be right in the middle.  And, and I can tell you, if you, if you decided any time that you got Potomac Fever, which we think you're going to catch, and you want to stay, we got an office in Washington.  You can go right there if you want to come back to the firm.  So, really, it was a, it was a no-lose proposition for me--made possible by the support of my firm.  And, and so, I came up knowing that if I didn't like it, I could turn right back around and go back with no loss of time--actually with credit for time at my firm, and I'd get a great new experience.  And if I wanted to stay here, I could go right to the Washington office which, ultimately, after a few years on the Hill is what I did.  So, after I served for his first term with him, and then to a little bit of his second term as a Congressman, after he was reelected, I left and rejoined the Fulbright & Jaworski office here in Washington.  So, it worked out well.  It was a great experience, gave me opportunities, and experiences I would not have had before.  And I was able to, and, and it helped develop me--I mean, it rounded me out, I think, in my legal profession.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, did you develop Potomac Fever as--
Speaker 2: I did.  Well, and I met my wife [Cheryl Washington], and I, and I really enjoyed Washington, a place I had not thought I would ever want to work when I was in law school.  But now, I was, I was here and, you know, I was kind of in the middle of the throes of this exciting new world on Capitol Hill, and dealing with legislature and the whole other area that I never even conceived of, or considered before I had developed relationships here.  I met my future wife at that point.  And so, I was very pleased to be here and, and through that experience and, you know, I, I think I gained lot of, you know, you know, friends and, and developed relationships that are still special today.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, you were with Congressman Andrews about how long?  I mean--
Speaker 2: About two and a half years.
Speaker 1: Two and a half years.  Is that--takes about 1985?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And then, you went back to Jaworski?
Speaker 2: Fulbright & Jaworski, Fulbright & Jaworski--
Speaker 1: Yeah, Fulbright & Jaworski, okay.
Speaker 2: --here in the Washington office.
Story_ID: 101347
Speaker 1: All right, all right.  Now, in '87 [1987], you were Special Counsel to the Corporation Counsel of the District of Columbia?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Now, how did that happen?
Speaker 2: One of my good friends, Fred Cooke [Frederick Cooke], who was a partner in another law firm here in town [Washington, D.C.] and, and someone whom, with whom I developed a relationship, was a native Washingtonian, had been put in charge of a search committee for the new Corporation Counsel for the District of Columbia which is akin to an Attorney General in most states.  And he had--was, you know, was part of this--leading the search committee when, of course, they, they turned around and asked him, would he be interested in taking the job?  So, he calls me up and we have lunch, and he starts saying, ahh, they're asking me to take the job.  And I spent probably an hour and a half convincing him that it was the great, it was a great opportunity.  It was 300 lawyers.  He was going to be in charge of basically his own law firm.  They represented municipal corporations that had litigation, legislation, that they, they advise the legislative, you know, advising role.  They had all these different roles, and he was going to be the top lawyer in charge of that office.  I said, you gotta take that.  You know, what a great chance, what a great opportunity for you.  And then, at the end of this, like impassioned-hour speech to him, about why he should take it, he looked at me and said okay, well, if I take it, you gotta come.  And I couldn't argue against it 'cause I just spent an hour arguing for him to do it.  So, I, I agreed to come.  And, and the interesting story about why I was Special Counsel, because that was not what I anticipated going in as.  I was supposed to be--Fred had wanted me to be his deputy immediately, but I didn't know the mayor.  I had not had any real contact with Mayor [Marion] Barry [HM], and I didn't know a lot about the city government.  And they didn't know, more importantly, from his perspective, a lot about me.  And to be in the second, the second ranking legal officer in the district, I think the mayor wanted to feel comfortable that he at least knew who I was.  And so, while Fred had wanted to bring me in as the Deputy Corporation Counsel, it's my understanding that the Mayor was little reticent to do that without having an opportunity to work with me first for a few years to know, to know me, and for his staff that could let, you know, deputy mayors and other staff, getting comfortable with me.  So, for the first year and a half or so, I was Special Counsel, and then worked closely with all of the Deputy Mayors and others, and helped run the office.  And there was no deputy corporation, Principal Deputy Corporation Counsel.  Then I ultimately, apparently, got the word.  Fred got the word--oh, it's okay, you can move him up now, and I became the Principal Deputy.  So, I always acted as the Principal Deputy, but for the first year and a half, I was given the title of Special Counsel.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 101348
Speaker 1: Now, I have, I think I need to go back and ask about Congress so for a minute--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --just to touch on it.  I mean, now is there a reason why you left?
Speaker 2: Because I thought that I had gotten a lot of what I needed out of that experience.  You know, I mean, Mike, Mike [Michael A. Andrews] had been re-elected.  He was pretty much established.  He was getting good reviews back in the home district in Houston [Texas].  I had been working on legislation and had kind of gotten a real sense of the legislative process.  We'd gotten some, some bills passed.  And so I--the drafting and the whole legislative process, I was comfortable with.  I'd gotten--at this time you have to remember Jim Wright was still a leader in the House, and so I had gotten a lot of it because I was a member.  I was the Chief Counsel for a member from Texas.  I was invited to a lot of--I was given a lot of opportunities to meet with a lot of the leadership, and to be part of those kind of leadership meetings and discussions.  So, I had developed a lot of contacts with career staffers and with members of Congress.  And I'd learned the legislative process, and I just felt like, you know, he's settled.  And this is not--I'm, I'm not going to be a career legislative assistant, you know.  That wasn't my, that was never my goal--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --although I enjoyed that public service aspect.  But I had now, you know, wanted to go back and continue to develop, 'cause I was really a young lawyer at the time.  I'd only practiced law for three and a half years before I went to the Hill, so I hadn't really gotten the chance to develop as a lawyer yet.  So, I wanted an opportunity to go back and do that.
Story_ID: 101349
Speaker 1: I just wondered if there were any interesting stories about Mickey Leland and Barbara Jordan and some of the great Texas people.
Speaker 2: Wow.  You know, there, there were, you know, I have to tell you a number of stories--about Barbara Jordan, of course, was just, just the most eloquent and powerful and real and articulate person that I knew.  I mean, she could, when she spoke, every, you know, everybody just went quiet, and, and when, every time she spoke, when she spoke, 'cause she's not someone who just talked all the time.  But it was just, it was always powerful, and it was always meaningful and, and it affected whatever the decis-, was going on, and I, and I didn't know her as well.  I mean, she wasn't somebody I really saw a lot.  But, but when I was around her, that's my impression of her.  Mickey Leland was much more somebody I was friends with.  He was the Congressman.  And I don't want to suggest that, you know, we were buddy-buddy, but we did a lot of things together that were outside of that, just the environment of, of work.  We both enjoyed music.  We'd go to clubs.  There was a group, 51st Psalm--I think was their name out of Houston, Texas who played at a church that I attended when I was in Texas--actually, a church that one of my classmates from law school's father was a minister, a church where he ministered.  And this was a group led at this particular sax player, who also played in the clubs around Houston, and became fairly prominent playing with Bob James and, and others.  And, and I'm sure, having a senior moment right now, and I'll remember in a second exactly to tell you the name.  But he, he became, you know, much--he, he broke out of the, sort of the local jazz scene, and became much more of a player in the national jazz scene and, and came up and we'd go to Blues Alley.  And Mickey and I would get the Texas group of guys who used to hang out and watch them at these clubs in Houston, then go up there and see him.  And Mickey was just a, just a good, good person, you know, soul, in his soul, just a wonderful person.  And, and, you know, his missions for humanity, you know, to Africa, and, you know, and his tragic death was really, was really tough for those of us who knew him because he's just--he really was a good man.  And he loved, he loved life and he enjoyed himself.  And, of course, that led to some controversies that he became embroiled in, from to time, but no one ever questioned where his heart was and what he wanted, he wanted to accomplish.  You know, there were other, you know, Congressional Black Caucus dinners and things that we did that, that I really enjoyed with him.  But he was much more of a, a friend.  And he and his wife, his wife [Alice Walton Leland] was fairly close to my wife [Cheryl Washington].  So we, we had a fairly good relationship, but the whole Texas delegation was an interesting delegation because you had such conservatives, even amongst the Democrats, people who were not only fiscally conservative, but socially somewhat conservative.  And, and working in that environment was, was really interesting.
Story_ID: 101350
Speaker 1: Yeah, that is an interesting kind of mix--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --when you think about some of the Democrats being conservative in that part of the country [Texas].
Speaker 2: Right, to get elected.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And, and, you know, and then, they probably believed a lot of it, too (laughter).
Speaker 1: What about now, let me ask you about--Lee P. Brown [HM] is another person, I think was--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Well, Lee, Lee Brown became the police--
Speaker 1: He may not have been there when--
Speaker 2: Well, he was police chief.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.
Speaker 2: Just before I left, I think, or maybe right after I left--I can't really remember, but I did have, I didn't meet him.  And he was a, you know, I mean there was--I guess he come from Atlanta [Georgia], and he come from Atlanta?
Speaker 1: Yeah--
Speaker 2: Where did he come from--Atlanta, I think.
Speaker 1: --I think he came from Atlanta and to Houston [Texas].
Speaker 2: To, to Houston.
Speaker 1: Then, then he went to New York.
Speaker 2: Right.  And, you know, again, a mountain of a guy, you know, you know, somebody who's imposing physically and, and very articulate, you know, very bright, but a big change for Houston 'cause it, Houston has--I mean, you know, Houston had, had a lot of concern.  There were a lot of concerns expressed about the Houston police force and its treatment of minorities, and, you know, both Latino and, and Hispanic and, and African American citizens.  And so, he was more, he was as much a symbol when he first came.  Of course, he ultimately put policies in place, so I think made a lot of big, big difference down there.
Speaker 1: Yeah, he, he's known for neighborhood-oriented policing.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And so, that was, that was real important to Houston stabilization.  And, of course, Houston, and it was a tough time 'cause Houston, at that time, was going through some tough economic times.  It went from the boomtown, sort of a bust, 'cause of oil prices.  And it was a lot of issues surrounding oil and, and the tax money dried up, I think, to a large degree.  And it was--a recession hit not too long either, right before or right after he got there.  I think it was right before he got there.  So, there was a lot more economic turmoil--not, money wasn't, the spigot wasn't on, so money wasn't flowing.  So, you know, that, that leads to a lot of dissension and, and tough issues for, for a police department keeping order and maintaining peace.  And I think his neighborhood policing really did help, you know, make that transition or that period better.
Story_ID: 101351
Speaker 1: I asked about a couple other people.  I don't know what more it, what you can say about them, but the president, George W. Bush, was in Texas.  And I don't know, did you ever encounter--
Speaker 2: But he--I didn't know because he--this was before he became governor.  And I really didn't know much about him other than I think he was a part-owner of Texas Rangers.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that may have, and I'm not even sure if that was the case at the time.  But, no, it was really--his, his father [George H.W. Bush], of course, was running for President in that election and was a--he and Ronald Reagan and, and he was, of course, came up with this slow--time--term, food economics and trickle-down economics.  And, and certainly for someone who was, you know, interested in, in politics, that was a very interesting dynamic.  And there were a lot of people, I think, who were more socially progressive who thought that, that George H.W., Herbert Walker, Bush would be a progressive president.  He came out of that kind of New England tradition of, of liberal progressive social thought, at least until he ran for president and lost.  And then, and then, you know, in order to maintain, I think, his political base, became much more conservative under the Reagan regime.  But I think there were a lot of people who were progressively more social who would have liked to have voted for him, or would have liked him to have become president.
Speaker 1: So you saw him as the old-fashioned Republican, the (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: The--
Speaker 2: The, the more, you know, the more--
Speaker 1: New England, yeah.
Speaker 2: --in the, I guess, the Lincoln or Lincoln Wing of the party or something, but he was the, or the, who, the Connecticut, in Connecticut--
Speaker 1: In Henry Cabot Lodge?
Speaker 2: Henry Cabot Lodge--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --in New York and, and, but that wing of the Republican Party.  And I think there were lots of us who thought, you know, there were a number of people who thought that chances are Republicans were going to win, and were hoping that it would be him and, as opposed to Ronald Reagan.
Story_ID: 101352
Speaker 1: But it was an interesting time down there [Texas] because down there from the, from the perspective of a lawyer, judges are elected.  And during that 1980 election, the--when [President Ronald] Reagan was elected, there were a lot of people, conservative, you know, you ran on partisan tickets who, who were running for judicial offices--never been inside a courtroom, never really practiced law, who were just putting their names on the ballots and getting elected 'cause they got swept in the Reagan Revolution.  And it just swept out so many really good judges.  And it really--I think, made the whole legal system chaotic for, for a while.  Of course, it self-corrected in '82 [1982] when Democrats won the mid-term election.  And, and a lot of those judges--there was a recognition that they'd put a lot of people in the basis of a, of a type, a partisan type, title, of Republican who weren't qualified to be judges.  And a lot of the judges who were returned after that had at least some experience.  I'm not saying that the Democratic judges are good, and the Republican judges are bad, but there were a lot of people regardless of the fact that they were, they, they had signed up to run in these offices.  A lot of people just weren't qualified, regardless of whether they were Republican or Democrat.  They just happened to be more Republicans 'cause that's what they were swept in on his coat-, on Reagan's coattail.  So, it was interesting, sort of followed the time in the court system also with judges taking over who were not experienced--so, it was just an interesting time in Texas.
Speaker 2: Any story about LBJ [President Lyndon B. Johnson] 'cause he was still alive and--
Speaker 1: You know, the stories I have about LBJ are all the classic stories of that, you know, about him bigger, being bigger than life as a politician.  And, and how he won his first election and, and sort of voting early and often, or stuffing the ballot box, and all those kinds of things which I don't have any belief--I don't have any reasonable belief of true or not.  But he certainly, he certainly--I think was someone who's profoundly affected by the Civil Rights Movement.  I don't think he was the same person that had been the LBJ that was elected and was running, was the speaker of the House and--I mean, of the, yeah--no, the--was he speaker before he became president?
Speaker 2: No, no, he was a, he was the majority whip.
Speaker 1: Majority leader--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --majority leader, before he became, and, and I think he probably was a bit more conservative.  But, of course, with the turmoil in the country and a lot of other things, and I think, you know, there are people who are now--
Speaker 2: How, how--
Speaker 1: --argue he's the greatest civil rights president we've ever had.
Speaker 2: Well, how did black people in Texas feel, how did they feel about him?  I mean, the people that you--
Speaker 1: Oh, I, I can't, I wouldn't be able to speak for them.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: You know, my time in Texas was too short--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --that I would feel very uncomfortable talking as a Texan--
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: --except when I'm down there.  And I have to say things are a lot more dire and, and that dog won't hunt.  So, I, I--there were some colloquial things that I, I picked up that I utilized, but, but I couldn't speak for them as a, as a resident of that state now (unclear).
Speaker 2: Okay.  I just thought it would be remiss if I didn't ask about some of--
Speaker 1: Yeah, no, that's good.
Speaker 2: --those people, but, okay.
Story_ID: 101353
Speaker 1: So, now let's go back as a court, Assistant Corporation Counsel.
Speaker 2: Well, I was Principal, that was Principal Deputy Corporation Counsel after being Special Counsel [to the Corporation Counsel]--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --and, and that was a great job.  I did a lot of, you know, supervising on litigation matters and economic development matters.  And it was a very interesting time because the day I walked in was the day the United States Attorney's Office opened its investigation with about twenty to twenty-five subpoenas for government records in their investigation of Mayor, Mayor [Marion] Barry [HM] and his contracting practices alleging all sorts of improper contracting, steering contractor friends, whatever.  And so they were seeking government documents and, and I was tasked--my first major task was to represent the government in its response to those subpoenas.  And, of course, I'm--doesn't have any kind of criminal law background.  And so, this whole criminal investigation and the rights of the corporation and in the, and the role the corporation played in, in cooperating with the United States Attorney's Office, and all that was something that I, I was, I was learning on the fly.  And, but also, in addition to that, that investigation which was a big, you know, a pretty high profile matter initially, you know, they're, the, this, the city still had to continue to operate.  And so, all the matters that involved contracts and, and had to go forward in economic development and, and in government public partnerships and things like that.  And I was advising on those matters, as well as litigation matters.  And so, it was a, it was an exciting, real exciting, but it was one of the best legal jobs I've ever had because it just was so broad.  And, and ultimately, we had, you know, as I said, I, as a Deputy Corporation Counsel, I assisted the Corporation Counsel in managing the office and, you know, so office with over 300 lawyers and staff, and did just any, any legal area that you might consider, we, we had pre-practice then.  So, that was great.  And I, and I did that, and it was through that relationship in working on projects and becoming known to the more broader legal community here that I was approached about--when I left, when I was ready to leave the government coming to other, other law firms.  And, again, one thing about a Fulbright & Jaworski, while they had an office here, that office was primarily servicing clients from out of state, out of the district, Texas clients, and clients from other areas of the country in regulatory matters.  And so, while I was here in the District of Columbia, I was, I was not necessarily a part of the District of Columbia, you know what I mean--not really involved in the community, and that's where I had always wanted to be in my legal career.  And so, having left and become really now a local lawyer, very involved in the community through the, through my work in the Corporation Counsel's Office, you know, I was seeking to continue to be part of the community.  And, and, again, that was public service and I keep going back to public service.  I went from the law firm to the Hill, to the law firm to the, to the Corporation Counsel's Office because those things were important.  And you make a difference in my mind in those jobs 'cause you can affect so many different people, as opposed to perhaps being case-centered in your individual practice in a law firm.  But now, it was into my mind, it was coming to the end of, of a term.  Fred Cooke [Frederick Cooke] had left.
Story_ID: 101354
Speaker 1: I was, was approached, and I joined Hogan & Hartson as a partner in 1990.  And having left Fulbright & Jaworski in '87 [1987], and gone to Corporation Counsel, I was now back in a law firm joining Hogan & Hartson.  Hogan & Hartson, of course, is the oldest law firm in Washington--not only was it an establishment of Washington, it was, you know, it was an establishment in Washington.  So, they had a lot of local clients and gave me an opportunity to continue to work with the local community, and become a lawyer that was part of this community.  And that was important to me because it gave me an opportunity to become involved in local politics again, something I hadn't been able to do since I was in Texas when I was part of that community as a lawyer at Fulbright & Jaworski.  And it gave me an opportunity to continue to work with elected officials.  And it was through that--it was in that position, having been involved in the government, and knowing the mayor who replaced the, Mayor [Marion] Barry [HM], Sharon Pratt Kelly [now Sharon Pratt, HM], that I got involved in, in local Democratic politics and, ultimately, became a member of, was it, ultimately to be the Chair of the Democratic Party here in the District of Columbia, and became a member of the National, the Democratic National Committee, as one of the State Chairs.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now, what year is this?  This is--
Speaker 1: This is in 199-, [President Bill] Clinton was elected in '92 [1992]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So this is basically 1991, 1992, 'cause I helped to run the campaign, the coordinated campaign for, for Bush--I mean, for, for, not for Bush, for Clinton in this area, in his first election.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: So you must have worked with Ron Brown or some other, right?  Yeah.
Speaker 1: I did work with the Secretary [of Commerce], of course, at the time, and he was someone I knew anyway.  He was very close friends.
Speaker 2: So he was head of the Democratic National Committee--
Speaker 1: He was head of the Democratic National Committee--
Speaker 2: --in those days, right?
Speaker 1: --after (unclear) after Clinton was elected.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And, yes, and a lot of other Democratic leaders.  But, again, what I, what I did was it afforded me the opportunity to not only play a role locally in the Democratic Party, but through that, my chairmanship of that played a role in the National Democratic Party.  And as one of the State Chairs and, and that was a very heady time and a very exciting time for me.  It gave me an opportunity to meet the President and to, again, be involved now on a greater national scale and political issues and--And that was all, again, part of that social engineering and politics and making a difference was--I was able to realize some of that by being, by participating in these things.  And I actually led the delegation up to the convention for the nom-, to nominate Clinton for President.  And so, that was very--it was an exciting time for me.  But again, it, it also established me--it gave me an opportunity to work with a national leadership and, and I think when I came back after doing that, I, I, of course, remained a head of the party until President Clinton nominated me to this, to be the, to the Trial Court here, the Superior Court of the District of Columbia which was in 1994 or '-5 [1995].  I was confirmed in '95 [1995].

Speaker 2: Yeah, and--
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: --there were several.  There were a number of investigations.  All of them centered around what they considered to be improper contracting practice of the District of Columbia.  And the suggestion was that these contracts were being entered into, of course, outside of the normal procurement process and to benefit the Mayor and, and other high-ranking officials in the District of Columbia government.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What was the--what conclusion did the government reach?
Speaker 2: Well, as far as I'm--there were, there was, as you suggest, a, a fairly intensive investigation led by Joe diGenova who was the United States Attorney for the District of Columbia at the time.  And the contracts were, the contracts in question were focused on the Mayor's program to increase opportunities for minority contractors while, at the same--and, and also contracts involving assistance to island or Caribbean countries that were in the process of developing more mature governmental systems.  And there were some questions about District of Columbia employees and what time--whether they were on government time performing these contracts in other locations.  And there were questions about how those contracts to minority contractors, separate and apart from this government work in, in, down in the Caribbean--whether those contracts were being awarded in a court with our procurement policies and the--even with the minority preference which Mayor Barry was, was a big part of his administration's initiatives.
Speaker 1: Well, how were these investigations resolved?  I mean, how--what happened?
Speaker 2: Ultimately, as far as I'm aware, because I, I may have left before the investigations.  I think, I believe I left the office before the investigations were completed.  But during the period of time I was there, no indictments were returned.  No, and, none of, at least against the Mayor, and, and any government officials at the time, challenging their efforts to, or challenging their decisions in this case.  So, there was a wide range investigation.  Lots of contracts were looked at.  The Mayor was not indicted, nor were any of his top deputies for any, any fraud or any contracting improprieties.  And, ultimately, I'm not sure whether there were any lower level indictments.  I'm not aware of any as I sit here, but I, I can't tell you that I'm 100 percent certain of that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But did, was Marion Barry ever indicted on, on any corruption charges as far as you know?
Speaker 2: No, as far as I know, Marion Barry, Mayor Barry was never indicted for any corruption charges.
Story_ID: 101300
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Now, this is, it--the reason why I ask is that it seemed to be a general impression that Marion Barry was, you know, by--I don't, it's created by atmosphere and the media or hindsight looking back into crack smoking incident that he was some, he was a corrupt mayor--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --but that doesn't, he was never indicted for anything.
Speaker 2: He was never indicted for that.  And he was a progressive thinker and a progressive mayor.  And, and he took chances to try to do things he thought were best for the community.  And when I say took chances, he pushed forward proposals, but legislative and otherwise, that created opportunities where none had existed before.  And I think that probably rattled to some degree the, the status quo.  And whenever you rattle the status quo, people want to know whether there was anything that was improper about it.  And so, investigations ensued.  I'm sure that for the public, generally, there certainly was a lot of smoke.  There were paper, newspaper articles every day, suggesting that because of the intensity of the investigation, there had to have been some impropriety associated with it.  And, and, of course, Mayor Barry was sort of a larger than life character.  And so, it was certainly in all of the, the theatrics or the practical circumstances came together to create sort of this impression that I think the public, the public was encouraged to believe by press accounts.
Speaker 1: Right.  I think--well, Mayor Barry--I know enjoys a much, a finer reputation in [Washington] D.C. than he does in the country at large.  I think it's--and I guess the media is responsible for that on some level in national media, but as you said, he's, he was an activist and high profile with--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and tried new things, which the previous Mayor Walter Washington did not.  He was a very conservative fellow from what I understand.
Speaker 2: Comparatively--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --comparatively.  And, and I'll, but, but it's not to suggest that coming out of the background that he did, as an activist, a student leader, you know, as part of a new generation of leadership.  He wasn't also a character.  So it's not, it's not as though he was a reserved individual who was putting forth.  He, he came out of an activist environment.  And so, his efforts to make changes were not--were, were also in that mode.  So, so I think the contrast was that--was it, was it contrast really historically--an historical contrast.  Walter Washington was our first Mayor, and as our first Mayor here in the District of Columbia, he certainly had a great deal of pressure and weight on him to show that, that this, this historic wall of, of not letting 600,000 people govern themselves, and then in, in a democracy like the United States was a, was, in fact, something that was--should never have happened, and that we were quite capable.  But he had to do it with an environment where there was a big transition.  I, I think his leadership made it possible for Marion Barry to, to step in and, and even, be more creative with that office.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And you made a good point that this is a hot seat and more so than being the mayor, you know, being a mayor any place is a hot seat.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: But this is maybe more of a hot seat because of the government--I mean the federal government being resident in the--
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: --in the city.
Speaker 2: Yes, and, and, again, there are great newspapers everywhere, great media.  But there's not, there's no city in the world that has the media coverage that you find here in Washington, D.C.  And so, anything that happens here becomes national news immediately.
Story_ID: 101301
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now is there any particular case or, or charge that you defended the city against that stands out?
Speaker 2: No.  Actually, because it never went to trial, there was never a reason for the Corporation Counsel to become involved in any litigation.  Now, it should be noted that our role was not to defend the Mayor.  As, as Corporation Counsel, our role was to defend the Corporation which is the District of Columbia government.  And so, to the extent that they were alleging that there was some systemic impropriety condoned or by government officials through whatever process we were engaged in--that is something we would have defended.  We would not have defended, for example, anybody in a criminal investigation because criminal charges brought would suggest that the individual was acting beyond the scope of their authorities, as a District of Columbia official.  So, while we were involved in production of documents and ensuring that the investigation was not impeded because, of course, the Corporation has the same interests that the prosecutor does.  If there's wrongdoing, the Corporation, meaning the District of Columbia government, wants to root it out.  And the Corporation Counsel, representing the District of Columbia, wants to make sure our processes are clean and free of any bias or any impropriety.  So we, we were ensuring that the process--we were conducting sort of our own audits, making sure that things were being done, at least policy-wise and legislatively and, and rule-wise, in a way that promoted fair and, and appropriate procurement policies following, of course, the--and when I say policies, policies that were established by the Mayor.  So, while there may have been a--and there was, a certain, a minority contracting program, that minority contracting program was supported by legislation that sets up, practice set-up, set up an organization, an agency that was required to produce rules to govern that program.  And as long as the rules were fair, and they were, and they were complying with those, the Corporation was doing its job.  And the government was acting in accordance with the law.  That's what we were focused on as, as members of the Office of the Corporation Counsel.  Any criminal charges would have been brought by the United States Attorney against individuals, would have had to alleged they conducted themselves outside that boundary.  And, therefore, we would not have had an interest in representing them because it would have been against the interests of the, of the Corporation.
Story_ID: 101302
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, the mayor's lawyer was mentioned a couple of times earlier this week and he's Herbert O. Reid [Sr.]--
Speaker 2: That's correct.
Speaker 1: --who has a civil rights background, right?
Speaker 2: Right.  The, the Mayor [Marion Barry, HM] had his own legal counsel, not with respect to this investigation, but generally, because the Mayor, of course, is putting forth policy proposals.  And he has his legal counsel advising him as to whether initiatives, legislative or otherwise, are in accordance with the law.  And Herb Reid was a great figure in, in, within, in the civil rights legal arena, was his lawyer.  Now, Herb Reid was not his criminal defense lawyer.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I don't know what--and I, again, because there was no indictment and no, and no trial on that, on those investigations.
Speaker 1: He didn't (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Right.  We're, you know, I, I--but he may have, again, a, a defense lawyer, a criminal defense lawyer, who was also advising him.  But Herb's, Herb Reid was really looking to advise the Mayor, separate and apart, from what the Corporation Counsel did, in terms of advising the government about how he might put forth policies and practices that were in accordance with the law.
Story_ID: 101303
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, in '89 [1989] when you left as [Principal] Deputy Corporation Counsel, did you--I mean, where, what did you do?  Did you go--is that when you joined Hogan & Hartson or did you--
Speaker 2: Right.  When I, when I left as Principal Deputy Corporation Counsel, I joined the law firm, then known as Hogan & Hartson.  And Hogan & Hartson was the oldest law firm in all of Washington, D.C., major law firm, quite a big player here.  And I had, had an opportunity, while with the office of Corporation Counsel to be involved in, in financial matters, not dealing with the government, but dealing with clients who wanted to use the government's auspices, for example, to float bonds to build housing and to do other things.  So, on one hand, on the one side, Hogan & Hartson was representing the underwriters, the private bankers, and others.  On the--and I was representing the government that was the issuer of the bonds.  And so, we had some interaction there.  We also had interaction on other economic development issues or, or economic development projects around town.  So, I know, I come to know a number of the lawyers there and had a great deal of respect for them.  And when I began to think about leaving the government which was in, in 1989, they reached out to me and, and asked whether I might be interested in joining them.  And that's how that relationship--that, that opportunity arose.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Was the opportunity at Hogan & Hartson the reason you left the city government?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So, oh, so what did you work on with Hogan & Hartson?  You were there for '90 [1990] to '95 [1995], right?
Speaker 2: Correct.  I worked on a variety of matters.  The great thing about Hogan & Hartson, for me, was that I had--they were, they were used, they were used to having individuals who sort of had more generalist backgrounds.  And, and they had the kind of clientele that could be serviced well by people who had different backgrounds because as in, as everyone knows in Washington, D.C., you have administrative, federal administrative practices.  You have local government, overlays of, for zoning and for other economic development projects.  You have legislative initiatives and, and enactments and, and concerns that clients have throughout the country.  And I had sort of--I believe, they believed, I had the amalgamation of experiences that would let me, that would allow me to be successful in, in different areas, helping their different clients navigate Washington, D.C.  Having been on the Hill, having worked on legislation, having relationships, and information about how that process works, allowed me to help clients in legislative and lobbying efforts.  And I had several whom I worked with on the Hill, on Capitol Hill.  Having the involvement and experience with the District of Columbia government gave me the opportunity to represent clients, and I did on zoning issues and other matters that involved the government processes more locally.  And, and so, they had, and they had clients who were both national and local.  And having been a litigator, both as a trial lawyer in Houston, and then as an administrator litigator with my prior law firm here in handling federal administrative litigation, I also brought that experience.  So, I think they looked at me as someone who had the ability to move throughout different practice areas in the firm and represent clients in different ways.  And so, I was very fortunate that they saw it that way because that certainly was how I hoped my experience would be viewed.
Story_ID: 101304
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now, now while you were at Hogan & Hartson, you were involved with the [President Bill] Clinton campaign, right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: President Bill Clinton's campaign for President in 1992?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So, well, how did you get involved in the Clinton campaign and what did you do?
Speaker 2: Well, interestingly, when--that was occasioned by my decision to join Mayor, then Sharon Pratt Kelly [now Sharon Pratt, HM], [HM] Mayor [Marion] Barry's successor, on a ticket as representatives to the District of Columbia State Committee, Democratic State Committee, or Democratic Party leadership, if, if you will.  That is an elected position.  And so, I ended up running city-wide on a slate that was supported by the Mayor, and was elected.  And as I, after I was elected, I was appointed to be Chair of the D.C. Democratic State Committee, which is, as I said, is the Head of the Democratic Party here in the District of Columbia.  And as such, I was--became a member of the Democratic National Committee.  And through my relationships with the Democratic National Committee, I had the opportunity to become very involved.  Of course, this was during the election of President Bill Clinton, and someone who I had a great deal of respect for and, and continue to this day, to have a great deal, of course, of respect for--whose policies I believed were appropriate and, and were ones that should be supported.  And so, I helped to run his coordinated campaign here in the District of Columbia.  And, ultimately, of course, he was, he won the Democratic nomination and was elected President.
Speaker 1: Now, did you support him from the beginning?  I'm trying to think about the other people in the field and the other--
Speaker 2: It was--
Speaker 1: --was it Dick Gephardt, Al Gore--
Speaker 2: Al, Dick--
Speaker 1: --who else?  Was it Jesse--
Speaker 2: [HM Reverend] Jesse [L.] Jackson had, had entered in for a while.  And from the very beginning as a Democratic D.C. Democratic Chair, I couldn't choose one over the others and--at least publicly--that was not appropriate because the party had not yet spoken.  And so, my goal at that point was to encourage across here in the District of Columbia and across the country--turnout for Democratic candidates, support for Democratic policy positions, and, and to encourage raising funds for Democratic candidates and to get the word out, to get the proposals and the policies and the--their, their proposals out.  And so, that was primarily my role.  Of course, after President, after President Clinton was nominated, I was much more focused on, on helping to develop platform policies and other things that were in concert with his, his beliefs.  And many of which, I, you know, thought were very sound.  And beyond, just as Democratic proposals, he, he was someone I thought had the potential to be--seek to, to make things better here in America.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, I imagine that he really carried the District overwhelmingly.  I mean, I would imagine but--
Speaker 2: He did.
Speaker 1: --what are some of the reasons--I know he's been called the first black president and that sort of thing in those days, what were some of the reasons do you think he carried (unclear)?
Speaker 2: I think his comfort around people of color was evident from the beginning--his ease, his, his sense of--you, you have a sense of equality.  He did, you know, no looking down, no patronizing.  He seemed to take and want and, and internalize the concerns of large segments of, of the community who were not the traditional white males.  And I think that in that, to a large degree, endeared him to people because when he talked with you, you felt like he was listening to you and cared about your views.  And, and I think that was really important because we had been talked down to for a long time and told for a long time what was best for us.  And here was somebody we really honestly believed was listening to us, and was willing to and treat us as equals, and treated us as individuals whom he respected, not only because we gave him votes, but respected on an intellectual basis.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And I just saw a picture yester--I mean, a couple of days ago from Ben Johnson of the black staff standing with Clinton, White House staff and--
Speaker 2: Uh-hum.
Speaker 1: --administrators in his administration that they're in the White House--different black secretaries of one thing or another.
Speaker 2: Right.
Story_ID: 101305
Speaker 1: And I was told that maybe a third of those people would stand today with Obama.  I mean, he didn't--[HM] President [Barack] Obama has not appointed, he's appointed maybe a third of the--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --number for office as, as actual African American president.  So, do you--I mean, well, I don't know even know what the question is but (laughter)--
Speaker 2: Well, I think that, again--
Speaker 1: (Unclear) (simultaneous), yeah.
Speaker 2: --it is--I, I don't know what, what--why President Obama has not appointed more people of color to those positions or as many as perhaps President Clinton did.  But he's coming in, in a completely different, again, historical context.  And, and I think that one can't ignore the politics of, the visual politics, of a black president coming in and, and assuring people that, that he is, he is also looking broadly.  Clinton was looking broadly.  He didn't appoint all white males.  He appointed lots of African Americans, Latinos, women, because he saw America as broad.  Well, we can't criticize President Obama for doing the same thing.  He's appointing a lot of people and he's not restricting it to a particular racial classification or group.  And he's showing the country that he also is looking broadly, but he's looking at it from a different perspective.  And you have to look at his perspective, from his perspective--he's not saying, only people of color or only women.  I'm looking broadly to, to see who might, you know, who I think would be the best people for this job.  And I am including in that conversation a lot of, people of color, and I'm including them, some of them, in my administration.  But that is not my number one overriding priority.  And, and I'm sure that he could have found very, very qualified and very, very competent people of color to fill all those positions.  There's no doubt in my mind, but that certainly would not have looked like America either.  So, I, I don't criticize him necessarily for feeling as though he's a little more constrained than perhaps Bill, even Bill Clinton was, in, in terms of those appointments.  I, I, I'm not sitting in his place.  And certainly, he has, he has not shied away from--he, he's not tried to cover up the fact that he is an African American president.  And so, it, it's not as though he's, he's enacting policies that hurt people of color so--or poor people.  We shouldn't just say people of color--poor people because I think that we sometimes can become too--look too much at race.  And it just happens that we're just--a proportion of people of color are poor.  But actually, I think policies that help the poor certainly help us and people of color significantly also because we are at the lower end of the socioeconomic ladder here in America.
Story_ID: 101306
Speaker 1: I, I know, I guess it could be argued that the time, that in 1995 when you are appointed to the D.C. Superior Court [Superior Court of the District of Columbia], it was a time when there was a lot of black involvement in politics in the city on the federal level and, and on the local--
Speaker 2: Yeah, absolutely.  As you noted, there were a number of cabinet level secretaries who are of color, individuals who had been involved in helping the President [Bill Clinton] and the Democratic Party develop its platform for his first election.  There were, you know, in fact, we talked about [HM] Vernon Jordan a little while ago.  Vernon Jordan was a, is a key advisor, someone that President Clinton looked to very--in, in lots of different, certainly in, in lots of different circumstances had appointed him to the Trilateral Commission.  I mean, this is, this is, again, at the highest levels of leadership in America.  He was, he was looking to people of competence, people of intelligence, without regard to, to color and lots, in, in at least, it, it appeared and maybe encouraging because he thought that helped America become better to see so many competent people, and so many of color, in, in, really important positions.  And so, I think that, I think that's why, again, we go back to thinking of him as being the first black president.  The fact that he could play the saxophone real well--had a soulful side to him.  Also, I think, led to many people's good--led the people to conclude that he might be the first black president.
Story_ID: 101307
Speaker 1: Right, right.  Now, 1994, a year before you were appointed to D.C.'s Superior Court [Superior Court of the District of Columbia], that's when we had a Republican revolution in Washington--Newt Gingrich.  Now you're still working for Hogan and--
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I'm still at Hogan & Hartson at the time and, yes, there's--
Speaker 1: Hogan & Hartson.  But the things--I mean, there's a major challenge to the Clinton administration and on the city level, [HM] Marion Barry reemerges as Mayor in 1995.
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: Yeah, but there are some restrictions, right? There's a--
Speaker 2: Well, what was happened at that time is we had got--we were in the throes of a financial crisis.  And, and the city--it was getting--the District of Columbia, maybe I should go back.  The District of Columbia has always been in the precarious fiscal circumstance because so much of the property here in the District of Columbia is government-owned and controlled--therefore no tax base.  University-owned or controlled, therefore no tax base.  Internationally-owned or controlled, through the, with regard to embassies and other Federal international organizations.  And so, because so much of the District of Columbia's ten square miles is, is taken up with non-taxable ownership, the tax base here--the, the burden on citizens to, to front the bill through the D.C., through local tax revenue and, and through tourism was creating a real burden on the government to manage both state level and city level services because, again, unlike other jurisdictions that pays taxes locally and then have state taxes, and then the state has certain responsibilities, and the local governments have certain responsibilities.  The District of Columbia was one big government, and it had both state level and local level responsibilities--very little tax base, no ability to tax income at its source.  If the income was not earned, if the individuals who earned the income did not live in the District of Columbia, they referred to it as commuter tax.  But every other state in the country has the ability to tax income at its, at the source.  So, if I lived, and I did for many years, live in New Jersey and work in New York, I had to pay taxes in New York, even though I lived in New Jersey.  Residents of Maryland, Virginia, and the surrounding West Virginia--people come from as far west as West Virginia to work here, make their money in the District of Columbia, but cannot be taxed on that income.  They're only taxed back in, in their local jurisdictions where they live.  So, what ends up happening is our tax base is so constrained here in the District of Columbia, that trying to handle all of those responsibilities with a constrained tax base was becoming much more difficult.  Now, the federal government was making a federal payment to the District of Columbia ostensibly for the services that the federal government was using because, of course, what is also lost in the conversations about statehood and about the District of Columbia needing to have more ability to tax income at its source was that the fire departments, the police department, they weren't making discrim-, they weren't discriminating against the people, the millions of people who came here to work every day, in favor of the 600,000 who lived here.  If you needed fire service, police services, water, you know, the streets were being impacted by the traffic--all the things that come with having a population that swells to millions and millions of people during the day, was still impact on the District of Columbia.  So, the idea that the federal payment which was, of course, just covering, you know, special services to a large degree.  It was--certainly wasn't compensating the District for all of its loss revenue for being the nation's capital--didn't make up the difference.  And it was putting a strain, and then with the political dynamics of a changing Congress, who was not happy about the local leadership for, for whatever reasons--again, may have, may have been because of Mayor Barry's personal or, or political persona, may have been because the District of Columbia was overwhelmingly Democratic.  But it's not something that just happened during that period of time.  It just was a confluence of things at that period, during that period of time, led to the District coming under its increasingly, increasing financial difficulties.  And, and so, I think there was confluence of a lot of things, and, and, it was building.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, this is--leads to the establishment of the District of Columbia Financial Control Board.
Story_ID: 101308
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, you know, [Washington] D.C. is operating under--you have the District of Columbia Financial Control Board with [HM] Sterling Tucker, you know--
Speaker 2: [HM] Andrew [F.] Brimmer--
Speaker 1: --Andrew Brimmer.
Speaker 2: --Alice Rivlin--
Speaker 1: Uh-hum.
Speaker 2: --a number of high, very well-regarded local and national leaders.  And, again, this is because the financial pressures have led to potential default by the District of Columbia government.  Bonds ratings were low.  And, and so, we were, we were in a sort of a crisis.  And, and I think it was, again, not though, the unwillingness of Congress to consider more drastic measures, like giving us the opportunity to tax later--income at its source made it, exacerbated the problem.  But the Control Board came in and the Control Board had to take, you know, measures to try to get our financial house in order.  And they did, they, they, they did a great job.  They were given extraordinary powers, of course--things the mayor couldn't do at the time--power to abrogate contracts, labor contracts, to, to shed other contractual obligations.  So, they were given enormous authority.  But, but, again, they did so in a very, very responsible way.  And I think that several of those leaders came out and ultimately supported the notion that the District, as a political entity with its limitations, would always be facing financial hardships.  There was, there was just no way around it.  They were going--it was, it was never going to, under that current regime, under the, but the expenses, and that the District of Columbia had to absorb without the ability to tax income at its source was always going to be in a tough financial situation.  And I think part of what animated and, and pushed Sharon Pratt Kelly [now Sharon Pratt, HM], who, when she was mayor, to be, to, to push so hard on D.C. statehood was the idea that, that was the only way she was going to get the financial resources.  She could manage the city in a responsible way, given declining tax revenues, high crime, and, and a lack of resources.
Speaker 1: Okay. Okay.
Story_ID: 101309
Speaker 1: Now, now takes us to 1995 now.  You were appointed to the D.C. Superior Court [Superior Court of the District of Columbia] in '95 [1995].  Tell us what the steps that led to that and--
Speaker 2: Interestingly, I was approached about the fact that there was an opening on the D.C. Superior Court.  And I had never, and I think perhaps, in our first interview, I talked about my--being enamored by, by the courtroom.  I had been a trial lawyer.  It was something I always wanted to do.  I thought I would be good at being a judge.  I really thought, at some point, I wanted to be a judge.  I had a number of mentors who were friends of my family who were judges, some of the first African American judges in New Jersey.  And I had a great--and I had an opportunity to sit down and talk with them as I, as I grew up--
Speaker 1: Well, who were they?  Let's mention them here (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --Judge Herbert Tate, who was on the Superior Court of New Jersey, who was a former diplomat.  Actually, his son, who was also a lawyer, and rose to the level of, and rose to become the Essex County prosecutor in New Jersey was actually born in Pakistan because his father was stationed over there.  But Judge Herbert Tate is someone, or was--he's passed, of course, who was a friend of my family's, and, and I had an opportunity to sit down and talk with.  Judge Harry Hazelwood, who for years toiled on the Municipal Court of the District of Columbia--the District of Columbia, excuse me, Municipal Court of Newark, New Jersey, ultimately was appointed to the Essex County bench as a Superior Court Judge.  He grew up two doors away from me--I grew up two doors away from him, excuse me, and in Newark, New Jersey, early in my, in my life.  And he and my father [Eleby Washington, Jr.] were very close friends.  And I had a chance to work with him, both when he was a lawyer, and to spend some time with him after he became a judge.  Another judge who was influential in, in my life, but I never had a chance to--I, I would talk with him, and this was when I was older actually in law.  No, I was in, in undergraduate school.  But his name was John Tear, Judge John Tear.  He also was an Essex County, New Jersey judge, municipal level judge.  And his, his daughter and I attended college together.  But even before that--knew each other and, and he was always very giving of his time.  And he would, you know, because of my interest, would, would talk to me about the law.  But they were all role models for me.  And, and I always thought that the service they performed was, was important and, and I thought that I wanted to be like them.  And I thought that I had the personality, the kind of temperament that, and the, and I hoped the intellectual capacity to, to be a judge.
Story_ID: 101310
Speaker 1: So, when this opportunity was, was brought to my attention, and, and I was asked about my interest, I, I thought--perhaps my earlier notions that I would wait till I was sixty to go to the bench.  I had to sort of move away from that notion, but to pursue it at that time.  But that I, I thought was a great place for me to try, to try to ascend to which was a Superior Court bench.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now, who appoints the--
Speaker 1: The President of the United States appointed me, and that was President Bill Clinton to the bench.  We have, in the District of Columbia--I think one of the best judicial nominating processes in the country.  It, it--very much a meritocratic process, not that politics doesn't play some role.  And it clearly--I had a, I was known to the President and to people in the administration.  But it is a local nominating commission made up of representatives of local elected officials, the bar, and, and the President of the United States.  And that, that's nominating commission interviews candidates and makes recommendations for the President.  And then, the President, after vetting those nominees, selects one for each position.  And then, that individual has to be confirmed by the Senate, so much like every other federal judicial appointment, our process is one in which it's a--after the Nominations Commission, see, the other presidential federal judicial appointments are, are often done clearly in the political realm because they're--the nominees are, the nominees come through the Senate.  It's sort of a Senate prerogative to nominate potential Federal District Court judges.  Here, and this is on both on our Federal Court and on, and on the D.C. Courts, there are commissions set up to vet potential candidates.  And those commissions are made, also include lay persons, so it's not a circumstance where the whims or the desires of one or two individuals sort of creates the pool of candidates for the President's consideration.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So, you're vetted by (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: D.C. Judicial Nominations Commission.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Correct.
Speaker 2: And the President himself makes the--
Speaker 1: Ultimately, three names are recommended for every position.  And then, the President decides to nominate one of those three individuals.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right.  So, so you are asked--I guess, by the Commission members if you wanted to--
Speaker 1: I was, I was informed of the opportunity by Commission members, yes.
Speaker 2: So, do you apply?
Speaker 1: Yes, you actually have to indicate an interest--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --and apply and fill out a form saying, I'm interested, I want to do this, and this is my background.  And then, that puts you into the process.  And then, there are interviews and, and follow-up and, and, ultimately, that Commission determines which three candidates, should go forward.
Story_ID: 101311
Speaker 1: All right.  I, I shared a notion for a long time that you had, that you had to be sixty to do this, so they, they don't ask if you're sixty yet, do they?
Speaker 2: No, they don't.  But you know what--it's interesting.  I think that they look for people who have life experiences and, but members of the judiciary have gotten younger and younger.  Appointments to courts have be-, of younger and younger people has been sort of a pattern for the last twenty-five years.  I think, at one time, and when I'm talking about my mentors who were in the law--they, they were appointed to the bench at a, much later in life.  And so, that's where my, my or why my, my idea that somehow this was a later in life appointment, came from.  But if you look at judicial appointments over the last twenty-five years, I think the presidential candidates have seen them as opportunities to establish legacies.  And the longer or the younger the appointee, the longer time they have to serve.  And you'll see that there--the elder statesperson, the Supreme Court in terms of when they were appointed of the newer appointees over the last twenty, twenty-five years is Justice [Sonia] Sotomayor, and she was only fifty-five.  The, the Justices before that were late forties or fifty to the Supreme Court of the United States--let alone to the high courts of, to the Courts of Appeals in the Federal Circuit which are even younger.
Story_ID: 101312
Speaker 1: Okay, excuse me.  So, all right, so what is your charge as a Superior Court judge?
Speaker 2: Superior Court judge, we were responsible--we were, first of all, the Superior Court of the District of Columbia is the general jurisdiction court for the, for the citizens and for others who work, live, and do business here when they have legal disputes that need to be resolved.
Speaker 1: So, it's comparable to the circuit court in a or a--
Speaker 2: It's comparable to--when you're talking about in, in--
Speaker 1: Municipal court or--
Speaker 2: Well, no, it's, it's--typically, court systems in states have some limited jurisdiction courts which would be the municipal court.  They only handle certain matters, small claims, other things.  Then they have a court of general jurisdiction typically, although they may have a family court that's separate.  And the general jurisdiction court handles everything that is above a certain, a certain level of damages, or in the criminal area, serious or criminal cases.  But if you think about what the trials most people hear about, those are handled in general jurisdiction courts.  And it's important to know--I think people don't all the time--That's when 95 to 99 percent of all cases in America are tried--too often because the only courts that are covered are federal courts which are courts of limited jurisdiction.  People have the sense that somehow those are the important courts.  And those courts review with state courts, or courts of general jurisdiction that are in state, like places, like the District of Columbia, but that's not true.  There's a--they, they prosecute federal cases, cases that involve diversity disputes between different state, residents of different states, who are over certain money threshold, or they deal with, deciding federal question.  They have federal question jurisdiction.  But, but, in essence, where 95 percent of the people seek, 95 to 99 percent of the people seek justice in America, it's in state courts.  So, all those criminal cases from, from the trespassing to murder, civil cases, medical malpractice, zoning, tax--those cases, other than the IRS and federal tax, are handled in courts of general jurisdiction which is what the Superior Court was.  And the Superior Court in the District of Columbia was also where that, where the family court is housed.  So, some states have--they have separate family courts with separate judges appointed in different ways.  And they have funding separate and apart from the general jurisdiction court system.  But here in the District of Columbia, the Superior Court judges would--justice may be rotating to a civil division, a criminal division, and you hear criminal cases, or a family court and hear family type, family cases, divorce, custody, neglect, you name it.  So, actually, service on the Superior Court, unlike service in almost any other court in the country is--require somebody with a great deal of breadth and an opportunity, and, and the ability to move between areas of law fairly seamlessly 'cause you rotate.  And so, it, it was a, it is a fabulous court with fabulous judges.  And so, the charges to resolve disputes peacefully and fairly here in the District of Columbia in accordance with the law.  And that was the general charge regardless of what kind of case you heard.
Story_ID: 101313
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what is like the African American history of involvement in the D.C. Superior Court [Superior Court of the District of Columbia]?  I mean, where--you were far from being a first, I'm sure.
Speaker 2: Far for me at first.  In fact, it was a chief, the chief judge of the Superior Court at the time I joined the bench was an African American man, Eugene Hamilton.  And, and so, we had, had African American judges on the bench for some relatively significant period of time.  And, in fact, my brother-in-law was a Judge on the District of Columbia Superior Court, Judge Paul Webber [HM].  And, and so, I had a great deal of not--I had, I had some personal knowledge of how the court operated when I came to the court.  But I also knew that there was a cadre of, of African American judges who were well-regarded--not just locally, but nationally.
Speaker 1: So, but African American service on a D.C. Superior Court, does it predate the Civil Rights Movement--
Speaker 2: Oh--
Speaker 1: --as such in the '60s [1960s] or does it, or when did it--we start serving?
Speaker 2: I, I don't know the answer to that question, to be honest with you.  I'm not sure when the first African American judge was appointed to the Superior Court.  My sense was that it was at about that time, about the time in the late '60s [1960s]--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --that judges were being appointed to our courts.  But you have to reme--African American judges were being appointed to the courts--but you have to remember that the District of Columbia courts were unique and changed over time.  And that's, it's a whole another interview about the different courts, and the control of the judicial process here in the District of Columbia.  It wasn't until 1972--we're relatively young in our current configuration court system because it was after court reorganization in the early '70s [1970s], and then after home rule, that the current court system was set up with a Superior Court.  And the Superior Court having the number of positions, judicial positions that it has, so it's, it's only evolved through the last fifty years, as opposed to most states, of course, who've had judicial systems in place for hundreds of years or so.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So that, that--it, it's, it makes a difference and, and that's both on both courts.  That's not only the Superior Court, but on the Court of Appeals also.  Our history of African American leadership as judicial officers--I think began in the late '60s [1960s].
Speaker 1: Okay.  I'm constantly reminded here that D.C. is a, is a Southern town in a lot of ways or better with--this untapped black local power.  You know, I mean, it's not completely untapped now, but it was--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --for many, many years.
Speaker 2: Oh, well, absolutely--
Speaker 1: I mean, franchised and--
Speaker 2: Right, this was a segregated city.  And for many, many years and by law, du jure, and then for many, many years after that, de facto, by virtue of, of geography and, and the distinction between, or not the distinction, but the, the--what's the right word--the, the, disproportionate wealth on one side and, and lack of wealth or, or poor people on the other side.  And that was, that broke down, not only in terms of wealth, but in terms of racial, racial lines.
Story_ID: 101314
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now you served early on, on the Standing Committee on Fairness and Access [to the District of Columbia Courts], right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And this is the committee that addresses some of this--
Speaker 2: It, it does, it does.  It--primarily, we were, at that point, trying to ensure that litigants who came to our court, jurors who served our courts, and, and individuals who worked at our courts, reflected the diversity of the city and were sensitive to the needs and concerns of individuals who needed to come before us.  And the Standing Committee grew out of a, a study that was commissioned by the courts on gender, on, on race, and gender bias in the courts.  It was--we were trying to, I think, determine whether there was a conscious or overt bias in the way we conducted ourselves in the practices and policies because now, increasingly, African Americans were moving into leadership roles.  At the time this study took place, we not only had an African American--I believe we had an African American Chief Judge of the Superior Court, but we now had an African American Chief Judge of--and she was not the first--we'd had a series of African American Chiefs of this court, starting with Judge Ted Newman [HM Theodore Newman, Jr.], and upon his appointment to the bench, and followed by Bill William [ph.], Bill Pryor [William Pryor], Judith Rogers, who's now on the D.C. Circuit, and my successor, my predecessor--I'm trying to say my predecessor, Judge Annice Wagner.  So, as, and as in that role, as Chief Judge of this court, they are also the Chair of the Joint Committee on Judicial Administration for the District of Columbia which is the policy making arm.  And so, the sensitivities and the concerns of that--we're probably a little bit more sensitive to, or the concerns and the issues of that people of color might be a bit more sensitive to--led to the, the study being done.  And that study led us to conclude that we had practices and policies that needed to be constantly reviewed in order to ensure fair and equitable access for all people, and especially people of color.  And they--I was lucky enough to have just been appointed to the court at about the same time that the study had led them to the conclusion they needed to create this Standing Committee.  And I was appointed to the Standing Committee.  And it was led at the time by Judge Inez Smith Reid, a native Washingtonian, graduate of Dunbar High, graduate of Yale Law School [New Haven, Connecticut], and, and Tufts University [Medford, Massachusetts] undergrad, which was my undergrad school.  And, and we undertook to reach out to the community and to review our practices and policies and to ensure that we were in compliance with the EEO[C] regulations and, and really to, to make sure--I think, although we didn't call it at the time, unconscious bias wasn't seeping into our practices here at the courts.
Story_ID: 101315
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So, now are there any cases that you were involved in that stand out during this period of time before you were appointed to the D.C. Court of Appeals--I guess, between '95 [1995] and '99 [1999]?
Speaker 2: You know, there, there are a lot of important cases.  I, I would not distinguish one as being more important or more significant than the others.  I handled a lot of criminal cases at the time, and what was the most significant sort of area that I, I was sort of an innovator in, along with other judges and leaders of the court, was in the area of domestic violence.  I was one of the judges who was involved in developing our domestic violence program and sitting on a domestic violence court.  I was also one of the judges who was involved in developing our Drug Courts.  And, and so I, I had an opportunity as a Superior Court judge in this changing dynamic of legal provision because, again, courts prior to the development of these sort of rehabilitative courts are these courts.  But prior to seeing our role as, as not only being adjudicators but, but policy, but, but beyond this deciding guilt or innocence, helping the, the--to stop the churn of cases--people coming back, recidivism, looking more broadly at our responsibilities, and seeing that the court had a unique ability to affect change beyond our decisions through the implementation of these problem-solving courts as, as they were known at the time.  They were coming into vogue at the time I was coming on to the bench to a large degree and, and the court, and that we were engaged in experimentation with these kinds of courts as a way of solving societal problems because, again, drugs were huge as you know in the District of Columbia at the time, a scourge of crack cocaine and others.  But there was also a, a great deal of concern over the hidden problems and the, and the costs that were associated with abuse.  And, and, of course, there was federal legislation passed, recognizing that this was a huge problem.  And lots of our cases dealt with relational involvement, relational violence.  And how do you deal with that, other than sending them back, adjudicating one as guilty of assaulting the other, and just moving on from there?  And so, we were trying to figure out ways of dealing with this, this number of cases, great number of cases coming into our system.  And I happened to have had an opportunity through my appointments from my chief judge and my interest to sort of get involved in those early on.  So, it's not any one case, but I think it's development of, of court practices and processes that moved from the adjudicatory to the problem-solving that I thought was perhaps my best or most important contribution to development of courts here in the District of Columbia.
Speaker 1: So, what were you able to do in the area of domestic violence to improve the (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Well in the area of domestic violence, a lot of it had to do with creating a process by which women and others who--and it could be men who were battered--had an opportunity to have their cases presented fairly.  So, we encouraged them to set up a self-help center in the courts where they had individuals who were volunteers, who could help not only create an environment where they could provide--present to the court their--the facts in a way that was consistent with the law, but also offered services to get them out of their homes, or to provide them with the, the information they needed to, to, present, as again, the best case to the court, so the court could take measures through temporary protection orders and others, to prevent further violence.  So, so I think in that regard, we, we moved from just sort of being an environment or a forum for people to come and say, this is, this was my problem to being a court system that tried to recognize uniqueness of the power relationship between the couples, the impact on families.  And we brought all that together in these domestic violence calendars with judges who were trained to understand the other impacts of decisions on, on the family.
Story_ID: 101316
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  In regards to drugs, 1995, and the Million Man March, [HM Reverend] Jesse [L.] Jackson, his--of many things he said, he gave his greatest hits and all that--
Speaker 2: Right, I remember.
Speaker 1: --you know, and all that, but he did--one of the issues he really delineated on starkly was the discrepancy of sentencing between people that abused powdered cocaine and those who abused crack cocaine.
Speaker 2: Uh-hum.
Speaker 1: Crack cocaine uses--being always the poorest because it's cheaper.
Speaker 2: Right
Speaker 1: And so more African Americans who are getting these severe sentences for being addicted to crack cocaine.  So, the prison system is filling up and, you know, lately, Michelle Alexander of Ohio State [University, Columbus, Ohio]'s book--
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: --"The New Jim Crow".
Speaker 2: Jim Crow, right, right.
Speaker 1: She's cracking on it again.  I mean, this has been going now for, you know, better part of fifteen years--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --talking about the same thing.
Speaker 2: Right, the war on drugs.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  The--we never had met.  We, we had sentenced--we, we had, we never had mandatory sentencing for drugs.  And we never, here in the District of Columbia, locally, were governed by the federal sentencing guidelines.  We had sentences for, for drug, of those convicted of possession and/or sale or distribution of drugs.  But they were within ranges, and we had some flexibility, much more than our federal counterparts in the United States District Court.  It didn't--but, but they were constantly processing and bringing those cases to us.  And people were constantly being convicted so, excuse me, so there, there was still, even with the, even with the discretion that we had, our jails were filling up with individuals.  And, of course, the cases that were being brought were being brought by prosecutors and police officers who were, who were making more arrests.  I won't say, targeting, but making more arrests in poor communities than they were in more affluent communities where there was powdered cocaine.  The discrepancy is something that I think I, I applaud my colleagues on the federal courts for coming out, especially African American judges who came out early on talking about the, the harshness of the sentencing guidelines and the discrepancy.  And some of them who really challenged that, that status quo after a while because they saw what the impact was.  Here in the District of Columbia, our Drug Court was much more focused on recognizing the need to offer alternatives to incarceration.  And so, we were looking at offering a range of services as part of creating an environment where people could see the courts, not as a place that, that incarcerated you, but as a place where if, that you could get, that if you were willing, and that if you hadn't engaged in violent criminal conduct or others that, that we couldn't countenance, but were--had a drug problem that we would try to be of assistance to you, and would look first to rehabilitate and solve your problem, as opposed to incarcerating you upfront.  And so, we created a number of calendars and programs to encourage and using the courts and, and using actually the stick we had which was, we could have incarcerated them to encourage them to, to get, to get help, and to turn their lives around.  And I think that was the impetus, that was what our drug court was designed to do.  And, and we, and, again, despite the fact that we didn't have those harsh sentencing guidelines.
Story_ID: 101317
Speaker 1: Okay, 1999, you were appointed to the D.C. Court of Appeals.  Now this is, again, by the President, right?
Speaker 2: Right.  This was by President [Bill] Clinton.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: There was a, an opening on this court.  And I had been involved, I think, in a number, as you, as you've noted, the Standing Committee on Fairness and Access which was a, a fairly high profile committee.  It was the first, and really remains the most important Standing Committee created by the courts.  And I was also--having been involved in, in trials and criminal matters, but also my involvement in the Drug Court and the Domestic Violence Court.  I think I was viewed as someone who had, in a short period of time, gained a great deal of experience.  And also, I, I think that I had the political background that gave me a more broad perspective on the law.  Again, I had both experience--practiced in the federal sector, the local sector.  I'd been involved in local politics, so I had, I think, the kind of breadth of experience that made people interested in my applying for this position, which would have allowed, which and I think in their view, allowed me to bring all those experiences to my work here in setting much more in interpreting the law.  And, and in, in deciding on larger policy issues as it relates to the law.  And so, I was again encouraged by some who were friends and, and supporters to apply for this position.  And I was lucky enough, again, to be one of the three nominated, and the, the President appointed me.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, the Court of Appeals was more appealing than the (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Well, interestingly enough, I, I--appealing, it, it had a different challenge.  And I thought it was something that I could do and that I thought I, I would enjoy.  And it was, frankly, an opportunity to, to do as I just suggested--to, to more broadly interpret the law that applied beyond the individual cases before me and, and ensuring at least in my mind, and what I thought was a fair application of the law as intended by the legislatures, Congress, and/or the counsel who passed them, and in accordance with, with community norms.  And, and so, this was an opportunity to speak more broadly and I thought I would take--I wanted to take advantage of it.  And that's not to say that I was--I felt so, so prepared to take on those responsibilities.  I, I was, I was excited by the challenge, but I'd always been a trial lawyer--never an appellate lawyer.  Now, I had advised appellate lawyers and had participated in appellate arguments when I was the Corporation Counsel because as a Principal Deputy, I was responsible for a lot of different areas of practice.  But I had not made, it was not my--I had not been a seasoned appellate litigator.  And my work in the trial courts had prepared me perhaps better to feel comfortable being a trial judge.  So, I came up here with a little bit of trepidation.  And perhaps my ego convinced me that I, I could do this job.  But it has turned out to be what I had hoped it would be.  And I've--it had now, fifteen years later, I'm still doing it.  It's been a, a great, a great move for me.
Story_ID: 101318
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, one of the formations that you joined earlier was a strategic--now, were you appointed to this, the Strategic Planning Leadership Council?
Speaker 2: Yes, I was.  I was appointed the co-chair of the Strategic Planning Leadership Council upon my arrival here in the Court of Appeals.  And what, what we were moving from, although at that time, we hadn't sort of--we hadn't really fleshed out what it meant to take the courts from sort of a reactive institution to a strategically managed institution.  But we realized and recognized that we had had, over the years, several different iterations of, of a strategic planning process.  And that strategic plans, as you are probably aware, often become nice coffee table books with lots of platitudes and great ideas that never get implemented.  The Strategic Planning Leadership Council was to go beyond the idea of just developing a strategic plan, but was to develop a strategic plan in the process, and the mechanism for implementing the recommendations of that strategic plan--moving from a strategic planning focus to a strategic management focus.  And, and so it was, it was sort of an innovative idea.  I had come--I had prior to this, which isn't reflected in your notes, I co-chaired what we knew, called the Quality Service Council.  And the Quality Service Council, and I co-chaired that, along with former Chief Judge Bill Pryor [William Pryor], was an effort to, to engage our workforce in coming up with ideas to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our court processes.  And so, it--we had moved away from, at that point, high levels strategic planning, setting goals and objectives to trying to encourage those who were actually working to, to make sure that cases were filed and, and officially.  And people were getting the support they needed in the trenches to a large degree, having it bubble up with ideas.  That process worked well in limited, in limited ways.  But, ultimately, it was decided that there were a lot--the court was evolving, problem-solving courts, reaching out to the community more, to, to get input, understanding or trying to understand the role that the courts played as a third branch of government, as opposed to being a sort of hidden adjudicator of disputes.  We now saw our role expanding.  And I think the Strategic Planning Leadership Council, the goal behind that was to see how we could, whether we were expanding in a way that made sense and increased the--and assisted in the mission of the courts which, again, was to resolve the disputes peacefully here in the nation's capital and to provide services.
Story_ID: 101319
Speaker 1: Yeah, I just wonder, now what was the, what were--I know there had to be complaints and issues, I guess, that, that would prompt the creation of a Quality Service Council.  I, I just imagine with the stakes so high, you know, people in court appealing a case that insensitive bureaucracy can really just make it a lot worse.
Speaker 2: Oh, absolutely.  I mean, you know, there's always procedural due process issues and they get heard here.  And while we have practices and policies, those practices and policies have to be reviewed consist-, constantly to make sure that there are changes that--and, and demographically or otherwise, that impact on whether, on the fairness of the application of those processes.  So, I, I don't remember and I will say this.  I don't recall, other than we were going through the same financial difficulties that the District was.  You know, our funds were, were limited, so we needed to become more effective, more efficient, and, and better, and better at providing a quality of justice to the citizens than we had been in the past, 'cause we were now also facing financial crunches.  And one of the things I think we need to go back to is that in 1997, Congress, in response to the studies that were conducted by the Financial Control Board and in response to the issues, the Financial Control Board and others were bringing to their attention about the financial viability of the District [of Columbia] passed what was known as the Revitalization Act.  And the Revitalization Act of 1997, in essence, recognized that there were certain state court, state functions, excuse me, state functions that the city could not financially continue to absorb.  And because the courts are typically in state court, state functions, states fund court systems, they, they--and because our court system was forward thinking and I think, to a large degree, well-regarded, not only locally, but nationally, they decided that the courts should be separated in terms of financial support from the District of Columbia, that the courts and justice-related entities, the public defender service, United States Attorney's Office was already separated as a Federal prosecutor.  The jail, the prison at the time, Lorton was under, you know, there was a lot of costs and expenses associated with, with supporting a, a prison here in the District--well, in Virginia, the Lorton Reformatory.  But, but they recognized these were all drains that most cities did not have to absorb.  And so, for that reason, we were, through the Revitalization Act, separated for budgetary consideration from the District of Columbia government.  But it, and, you know, that which meant probation, and probation and other services that the courts offered was taken away, and create a new Federal agency was created, the Offender Rehabilitation Bureau.  And they did pretrial services and adult probation, but they were taken out of our budget, created into a separate--made in, a separate federal agency.  We were separated from, financially, from the District of Columbia government expenses.  And we became a directly funded federal entity of Congress.  And, but during that period of time, there was a lot of transition.  Our cost structure was being reevaluated.  We were facing financial difficulties.  And so, to a large degree, the Quality Service Council and subsequently, the Strategic Planning Leadership Council were also designed to try to address this brave new world the courts were embarking on, where we were now separate and apart from the financial constraints of the District of Columbia, and also to a large degree because of our jurisdiction under the Home Rule Act.  We had to make our own policies, and that's what the Joint Committee's role was.  And that was all happening about the time that I was being appointed to this bench.  So, 1997, I just had 1998, 1999, the Joint Committee and the Strategic Planning Leadership Council were both dealing with this new reality.
Story_ID: 101320
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, the, the plan was finished and established in 2003, right--
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: --which included enhancing the administrators and of justice, brought in access to justice and services to the public, promoting competence, professionalism, and civility, improving court facilities, technology, and building trust and confidence.
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: These are all the things that--
Speaker 2: Those are the things that, those were the major goals and objectives that the Strategic Planning Leadership Council came up with that we wanted to, over the next five years, enhance and, and improve.  And what we did, and this is where the, the beauty of the process and the beauty of the Leadership Council, being established, comes in because that is a wonderful litany of, of ideas and goals and objectives you want to accomplish.  The question was how are we going to implement them?  And the Leadership Council had the authority--well, not the authority--what the Leadership Council was asked to do was to make recommendations now upon--about how to accomplish these, these goals.  So, it was going to transform it from the coffee table book to actual practice and were given the sort of support by the Joint Committee on Judicial Administration which, of course, was the body I now chair that is responsible for all policy making in the District of Columbia with respect to judiciary, was given that kind of support to, to develop a process for implementing it.  And so, we went from this leader, from these goals and ideas to create, to the idea of creating what we call management action plans which push down the implementation of those strategic planning goals and objectives to divisions and (unclear) to court.  And then, we were further able through our--through, with the assistance of our human resources division, to, to include in the individual performance plans, the goals and objectives or, or ways, you know, setting forth as part of those responsibilities, accomplishing or moving us forward, and accomplishing these greater goals.  So, the individual performance plans of, of employees was used to, to foster a sense of importance in and because it directly impacted their job performance, the act, divisions development of plans to accomplish the greater goals of the institution, which is the D.C. courts.  And, and I think that is why that program was as successful as it was--the support of the joint committee and the leadership of the strategic planning.  And we hired staff.  We didn't create a book and then let it go.  We created, we hired a strategic management--that's what we developed.  We moved from strategic planning into strategic management and hired staff to actually--full-time staff, to help us implement the goals and objectives of the plan and create the Strategic Management Office.  And that's in, and, and what's significant to me is that this, and from my leadership was that, that I then became the Chief Judge of this court and the chair of the joint committee.  And so, I was in a position to continue to push forward those reforms.  That's (unclear) the Strategic Planning Leadership Council had, had come up with.
Story_ID: 101321
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So, in 2005, the Access to Justice Commission was created under Annice Wagner, right?
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: And tell us about--well, first of all, tell us about her.  Now, she's a--she was your predecessor?
Speaker 2: She was my predecessor.  She served for--I think eleven years, ten or eleven years, maybe a little bit shorter than that, nine, ten years.  But she served a little more than two terms as a Chief Judge of this court and she was a very, again--she, she, it was under her leadership that the court started looking at, at race and gender bias.  She was appointed--not under her--she, she was the Chief during a lot of that, development of that plan.  But she was also Chief during the implementation and the establishment of the Standing Committee on Fairness and Access.  She's a native Washingtonian, another Dunbar High graduate, who grew up in this city when it was segregated--who had a, a sense of this community that, I think helped to push along--made, made her uniquely aware of, of problems in the past that we needed to address in the future.  And one of the things that she was aware of was how difficult it was for people of color, and not only people of color--poor people generally to access the court can get the relief they needed.  And she saw an increasing or burgeoning number of people who were coming to the courts without any legal assistance and, and understood that this was an area that we needed to tackle, now that we had sort of moved and, and, are, are internally moved to strategically manage and engage our workforce and to sensitize them.  It was time for us to look outside the court and see how we could help develop a capacity of lawyers to help these people who are--couldn't afford lawyers themselves.  And that's what the Access to Justice Commission was designed to do.  And, part of that information came as part of our outreach on the Access, Standing Committee on Fairness and Access, because in going out and talking to people in groups and lawyers and legal service providers, we, we found that there were a lot of things that they were facing, challenges they were facing that, of course, impacted the courts because they were--their provision of legal services to such a small part of the population highlighted the, you know, the quality of their presentation.  And their preparation and their assistance highlighted just how difficult it was for courts to adjudicate fairly people's cases that didn't have representation, and if you can understand, you know, when you see the lawyers coming in representing the small segment, and you're seeing the kinds of issues that they're bringing to the fore, and giving the courts an opportunity to decide.  And then, you have unrepresented people in the large masses of unrepresented people coming who can't present those issues.  You realize that their quality of justice they're getting is certainly not anywhere close to the quality of justice that small percentage was getting, and you realize you have to reach out.  And I, I think it was, of course, again, in keeping with my prior service on the Standing Committee, the [Service] Quality Council, the Strategic Planning Leadership Council, I, I think I was a natural for appointment to that Access to Justice Commission so I was, as I was with the Standing Committee on Fairness and Access, a charter member of the, the Access to Justice Commission.  But, and I, and I, again, as part of the Strategic Planning Leadership Council, that was working in conjunction with the Joint Committee, you know, and, and as a member of the Standing Committee on Fairness and Access with her, with all of those experiences and with her leadership, the establishment of the Access to Justice Commission was just the next logical step.
Story_ID: 101322
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now, now, the first chair of that commission [Access to Justice Commission] was Peter Edelman, right?  Now, he's--is the same, is he that Edelman who was involved in SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee] back in the days--
Speaker 2: This is--Peter Edelman who was in the, the--came up and was a member of the administration of President [Jimmy] Carter.  He, he has, he has been, he's [HM] Marian Wright Edelman's husband--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and has been involved in the Civil Rights Movement for years.  But his focus has always been on poverty and poor people.  And he's a professor at Georgetown Law School [Washington, D.C.], well-regarded, well-renowned across the country for his studies, and his legal analysis of, on issues that face people in poverty.  So, he was a natural--one, he had the, he had the national stature to bring the kind of focus and attention to the Access Commission Movement because this was not the only one in the country.  There was a movement around the country, around this time to, to establish these commissions because the courts again were moving and evolving out of the old traditional adjudicatory where the third branch is over here quiet, to understanding that we had a role to play in, in making the community better and, and ensuring fair justice.  And we were stepping out of those old constrictions.  So, so he was a, a--and to this day, 'cause Peter Edelman is still the chair of the D.C. Access to Justice Commission.  In fact, I just reappointed him for three more years to that position and 'cause he's a tireless advocate.  And Inez Smith Reid, who chaired our Standing Committee on Fairness and Access, became the vice-chair because it showed the commitment of the highest court in this jurisdiction to the issues of access to justice.  And it also provided us with the synergy between the Standing Committee's work and, and improving access and fairness within the court to improving access outside by providing services and creating opportunities for lawyers to represent low income individuals.
Story_ID: 101323
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, 2005, you, you were appointed Chief Judge of the D.C. Court of Appeals, right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Is this the same kind of process you go through the D.C. Judicial Nomination Commission, and then the president appoints you?
Speaker 2: The, the--actually, the judicial, unless there's--the D.C. Judicial Nominations Commission actually has the authority to appoint the Chief.  The President, of course, could veto it, but they have the authority to appoint the Chief.  And so, when Chief Judge [Annice] Wagner announced her retirement, I expressed an interest in becoming the Chief.  And, although I was one of the baby judges on the court, the baby judge, I guess, on the court at the time, I was supported unanimously by all of my colleagues for the position.  So, I sort of put--made it a little easy for the Nominations Commission because everybody who was capable of being the Chief was supporting me to be the Chief.  And, and I, I can't tell you how much that meant to me to have garnered the support of, of judges who've been on this bench for twenty or more years to be their, their leader.  So, that process is one in which those individuals who are capable, qualified, which meant somebody on this court, or somebody who was appointed to the court, or being appointed to the court, were the eligible candidates.  And my colleagues were all very supportive of my candidacy.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, this is the fourth year of the George Bush, George W. Bush administration.  Does the president make--I mean, a Republican president in this situation in [Washington] D.C., do they really--I mean, do they see this as a place where they want to power in terms of these appointments?
Speaker 2: It, it--I, I think, again, it, in my visit in, in, and at the time that I was being appointed, there was no hint of any political involvement by the president.  The--and it's not typical.  The way we have it, and that's why I was talking earlier about how beautiful, the beauty of our system, the meritocratic process here.  The--in--people on the commission represent diverse interests.  It's not the mayor or it's not just the president.  It is the bar, the mayor, the president, the counsel--all these different interests come together and, and when the speak, they, they speak with sort of the authority of all of these different bodies from the president, to Congress, to everyone else.  So, so in essence, when those names, for example, go up to the president for appointment--yes, there have been individuals who have, have met with, who have not been seen or viewed by the president as being, you know, the candidate that, that they would like to choose.  And there's others who you think might be well-qualified and, and so, there are political decisions made with respect to those three people.  When it comes to the chief position, the, the position of Chief Judge of this court, I am not aware that the president has ever weighed in because at that point, I think the president would be hard-pressed to, to appoint somebody when the candidate has pretty broad support of, of the judges on the bench.  So, it seemed that, sort of--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --throw the court into turmoil for no reason, and it doesn't benefit the president really.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I--
Speaker 2: So, politically, it wouldn't make much sense to do it.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I wondered of all the things they wanted to do if this was something they want to do.
Speaker 2: No.  You know what, it, it really isn't anything that--this is not a court that, as I said, there's, there's a lot of political advantage to involving the president and--
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Story_ID: 101324
Speaker 1: Now, you--one of the tasks that you--well, maybe I should ask you just a, just talk about what this--what was on your agenda as Chief Judge of the Superior Court?
Speaker 2: I think, as, as Chief Judge of the, of the Court of Appeals--
Speaker 1: The Court of Appeals, right.
Speaker 2: --my agenda was to, to continue to move the court towards a, a strategic management model, while sort of pushing towards achieving a vision that we had established as part of the Strategic Planning Leadership Council, which was a vision of being open to all, trusted by all, with justice for all.  That was our vision.  And, and in order to accomplish that, increased transparency was important to me, so that the public's trust and confidence would be enhanced because they would really know what actually happens, and the efforts that the court makes to ensure that justice is done.  You know, we're fighting all the TV judges and all this other--all the, all the drama shows and people's impressions of how courts operate are being shaped by things other than the courts themselves.  And so, it was important for me as Chief to come in and say, no, we're not engaged in, in that--the theatrics of, of the law.  We're engaged in the actual dispensing of justice and the law and, and this is how we do it.  And so, reaching out even more to the public was important to me as the Chief Judge of this court, and so establishing programs like my--the--I call it the Road Show.  But it's, it's a program where the court is--actually, actually goes out to the community and typically to the law schools in the community to hold oral argument, so that they can see and understand how serious we take the issues that come before us, and how much thought and consideration and concern and time we give to understanding those things.
Story_ID: 101325
Speaker 1: Yeah.  What, can you give us some idea of, you know, something that happened during the Road Show--some of the draw of the Road Show?
Speaker 2: Well, well, what, what's most interesting about our experiences at the different law schools holding court in the community is, one, it provides greater educational opportunity for those law students.  The public, it's in their community, so they can come by the law school and watch the arguments--where they can't necessarily get down here to the Courthouse to see arguments.  And, and so, we've had really--it's also, I think, raised the level of respect for the lawyers who practice before us because now the community sees that these lawyers are engaged and thoughtful and helpful to the court.  And, and it's not theatrics.  It's, it's actually a, a serious discussion of how the law should develop and what the law should be, and whether this, there's, a trial was fair.  And, and so, to me, the drama is seeing the faces, and listening to the questions of the lawyers and the law students, and the--I mean, after, after the presentation of the cases, to have the interaction with the law students and the professors and the community about what they've seen, and about how we operate.  And it's watch the level of, of knowledge, of, of the role of the courts increased tenfold just from that interaction on that one day because I don't think people really understand what the role of courts is, you know, are in America and because we have been sort of the hidden branch of government for so long.  So, I, I think that's been, there've not been any--these are trials.  So, so it's not a situation.  Well, while they're out there on the road, we're out there on the road.  We've got a lawyer who's, who gets a dramatic confession from a witness.  And there's a jury.  And then, there's this DNA evidence, and somebody--that, that doesn't occur.  These are, these are oral arguments pertaining to the law, the fairness of a trial, and, and where it captures people's imagination is because we have a case that involves a contested adoption.  And they're listening to the arguments about why this person's parental rights were terminated and whether that was done fairly.  And they're learning about the, the constitutional prerogatives and, and the burdens of proof that each side has.  And, and what they're hearing is, oh, this isn't just 'cause the judge likes this parent better than that parent.  This is--the judge is applying the law, as has been determined by the court and the legislature to the facts of this case.  And they're doing their best to try to do it in a way that addresses all of the myriad issues.  And they're amazed that the number of issues, the number of, you know, considerations that a judge has to take into consideration before making an award of custody or whatever.  And I think that's--the light goes off for them that, that this is, this is a place of, of seriousness and a place where it's not a political, it's not, it's not just like the rest of Washington [D.C.]--a, a cauldron of politics.  But it is actually a, a place where politics is, is put aside to the extent that we're actually looking at, and trying to decide whether the law was applied properly.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, Washington, D.C. seems to be a city with lots of lawyers and the law schools as well.
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: So you got Georgetown [University], George Washington [University], UDC [University of the District of Columbia], American University, Catholic University, Howard University.
Speaker 2: Howard University.  And we've held oral arguments at all those, and they're not mock trials.  These are not cases that we just made up, so they can see judges listening to fake facts and, and sort of posturing.  These are actual cases that are filed here in the court.  They are regular calendared.  They would have been heard here in the court, but for the fact that we want to give the public an opportunity to experience what we do every day.  So, we held--take them on the road.  So these are real cases--they're real lawyers, they're real lives.  You know, I almost sound like a TV show, huh (laughter).  And, and we try to do the best we can to resolve it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, the person--I mean, the--some of the facts on the TV show, I think, are like personality of the--
Speaker 2: Right.  We, we don't--
Speaker 1: --litigants?
Speaker 2: Right, right.  We don't have to worry about personality.  The litigants, although 'cause, you know, we have very flamboyant lawyers.  And, and often, those lawyers, even in their discussion of mundane issues of the law, like to juice it up a little bit and, and make it.  And, and they bring real life consequences into the conversation.  And that tends to, to bring a little bit more of a real sense of what's at stake in those oral arguments.
Speaker 1: Do lawyers volunteer--I mean, do you have a pool of lawyers that volunteer to present these arguments or are they--
Speaker 2: Oh, no, they already represent the parties.  This is just--these are the lawyers that the parties have--
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --and that, that represent the parties.  If it's a civil dispute, there are lawyers that nine times out of ten, were hired by the parties.  If it's a criminal case, of course, and they're indigent, we appoint lawyers.  And we do have, just as, as they do in the Trial Court, a group of appellate specialists who, who we assign to criminal cases where we have indigent appellants.  And their role is to represent those appellants in any appeal process.
Story_ID: 101326
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Sounds like a strong educational tool--
Speaker 2: Well, it, it is.  And it's interesting because I also implemented the audio streaming online.  So, all of our arguments, even the ones here, can be accessed by going to our website, and you can listen to all of the arguments.  And in June of this year, our--we will be video streaming for the first time live on the internet--arguments from this Courthouse.  Again, all of these things, in my mind, increase the public's trust and confidence in the courts that we are not operating like Congress or other political bodies, but are trying to, to really address significant issues in a thoughtful manner.  So, some people say, oh, camera in the courtroom.  This is terrible to me at this level--not at the trial level where cameras in the courtroom might impact on the performance of witnesses, and might impact on the truthfulness or the integrity of their testimony.  Up here, we're talking about the law and, to me, letting the public understand how important these issues are--is, is important for public trust and confidence.  Now, of course, this is an age, of course, of terrorism and tax on the judiciary.  And so, you know, my colleagues' support is not something I could have done without the support of my colleagues because, of course, the marshal service and others aren't excited about judges being on television and being that publicly well-known.  I am publicly known because as Chief Judge, I'm out in the community all the time.  My colleagues are less and can be more guarded about their identities.  This is going to expose them in certain cases.  These are going to be on bond cases, big cases, cases which have significant legal issues where we're going to be televising them through the internet.  So, but it is going to expose them as to the public more.  And, and with that comes some risks, but they are all very much committed to the idea that it's more important that the public understand what we do than their own, you know, concerns about personal safety.
Story_ID: 101327
Speaker 1: Okay.  The way the Court of Appeals works--correct my ignorance on this if I, you know, is that I, I appeal to the court.
Speaker 2: Uh-hum.
Speaker 1: And then, the court--I mean, the judges, make the, this decision right about, around my appeal--not, I mean, based on arguments presented to the court--
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: --rather than a jury and--
Speaker 2: Right, exactly.  We're--our role is to determine whether it was fair.  It might mean whether the law was interpreted correctly by the trial judges, and whether the evidence that was presented was presented in a way that didn't--it didn't impact improperly on the presentation, or either side's fair opportunity to be heard, and for the court to consider all the--to make the best decision it can.  And so, when you get up here--the lawyers, and it's not always oral arguments.  Ofttimes, we decide cases based only on the briefs and the record.  I would say, mentioning earlier, technology has made it possible for me to be anywhere in the world, and access the briefs and the record from any trial heard--held in Superior Court.  In fact now, any administrative hearing held in the Office of Administrative Hearing, or even if there was a zoning appeal filed to access the university plan for zoning--on my iPad, and read and, and decide on a computer, look, do legal research.  So, we have a lot more flexibility as to how we do our work, but, of course, with that comes this overriding burden to work, to, to get things done when you have a minute, as opposed to understanding that there's got to be some separation.  And, and my colleagues are so committed to their work because we have so much work to do here that ofttimes, I worry about them and their health because they are so busy and always engaged in, in what is very, very difficult work.  And, and, so on the one hand, it's a blessing to have this access.  On the other hand, it just brings to the fore the constant impor-, you know, the importance of what we do, and the consistency of the work in that area so.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  And you were saying off camera, we were talking about the intensity of this job and there's no end.
Speaker 2: There's no--
Speaker 1: Like the song (unclear), it's always something that you can be reviewing.  And so, how do you determine when it's time to go home or--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).  I think that we, we make the best call we can.  And I have colleagues that I wonder when they go home, to be honest with you.  You know, you have to--after a while, you get into a rhythm, and you know that you, you have to get certain work done.  We have what are known as internal operating procedures.  And those internal operating procedures have time limit, time standards.  And those time standards, 'cause performance measures are important, both in the Trial Court and in this court.  We do have performance measures that require us to get matters out in certain periods of time that call on us to respond to our colleagues in the, in certain time frame, within certain time frames, to write additional or concurring, or concurring or dissenting opinions in a particular time frame.  So, we've, we built into that time frame, enough time, so that we can give thoughtful consideration in every case.  The problem isn't so much--that is, you know, trying to comply with those (unclear) is important because it helps us get cases resolved quickly.  And, and as you know, justice delayed can be justice denied.  So, we want to move more quickly in getting our cases, but, but also builds in enough time for us to, to try to think about the cases.  The real problem this court has is that this court is unique amongst appellate courts in the country in, in that our court has jurisdiction over all appeals from almost, from whatever source.  And it's mandatory jurisdiction, meaning we have the obligation to decide every case that's appealed to us, and decided on its merits if possible.  There are other court systems, other states that only have a trial court and a high court--Rhode Island, West Virginia, North Dakota.  There are, there are courts where they don't have an intermediate Court of Appeals that does a lot of error correcting.  But in those jurisdictions, unlike ours, they can decline to hear appeals.  They don't have to listen to every appeal that's filed and decided on the merits.  So, in West Virginia, you might have 3,000 appeals filed, but they may only resolve 200 of them on the merits, and denied appeal in the rest of them by saying it's not, it is not an appeal that we, that we believe is important enough for us to hear, or we believe the trial.  You know, we, we're satisfied that there is not an issue here that, that we need to address that's been raised.  We give reasoned opinions for every decision we reach.  And we have mandatory jurisdiction, so when we have 18-, 1,800 cases filed in a year, we resolve almost the same number of cases, and not the cases that were filed that year because, of course, they were filed perhaps in previous years, but we have to resolve all of them.  So, while there might be--well, most High Courts, Maryland, Virginia, Maryland Court of Appeals, Virginia Supreme Court might resolve 300 cases a year.  We resolve 1,800 cases a year.  Where the Supreme Court resolves seventy-five cases a year, we resolve between 1,600 and 1,800 cases a year--to give you a perspective on how many cases that we (unclear).  And when we resolve them, we resolve them with memorandum, opinions, or fully-published opinions, which means they are thoughtful documents that cite cases, and tell the reason why we are agreeing or disagreeing with the appellant's contentions.  That is unbelievably burdensome on the judges on this court.  It's one of the reasons we sit in panels.
Story_ID: 101328
Speaker 1: Most High Courts sit en banc.  They sit as a body to hear their 200 cases maybe.  In some of those cases, they don't grant oral argument and, but they decide.  We sit in panels of three, so that we have the opportunity to hear as many cases as we have.  I sat yesterday on three cases for two of my colleagues--very important cases.  My panel will decide those cases--the panel I was on will decide those cases.  But once we decide the cases, we circulate whatever opinion comes out of that to the full court, because the full court has to provide us with comments or concerns, because that opinion that we reach in this case, and the case we heard yesterday, will bind the entire case and set precedent for the courts in the District of Columbia.  So, we, we not only resolve everything on the merits, we have to put in additional processes in order to assure uniformity to the extent we can, or go en banc when we sit together as one court, all nine of us, to change the law or to do something that, or to address an issue which we believe is unsettled, that we think is appropriate for en banc consideration.  So, you're right, here, because we have to because we're taking the 1,600 cases, and we're not getting rid of--I mean, 1,800 case.  And we're not just getting rid of 1,600, and saying we're not going to hear them, but actually, reading the briefs, deciding the case.  There's always another case to work on.  So it's the, it's the constancy of the filing.  And you're right, we have more lawyers per capita than anywhere in the country.  The D.C. Bar has over a million members--I mean, over 100,000, I'm sorry, million, excuse me, over 100,000 members.  Now, most of them, half of them probably, or maybe a third of them don't practice here regularly.  But if for a city, state that has in the neighborhood of 700,000 people to have even 40,000 lawyers--50,000 lawyers practicing regularly in the jurisdiction is a huge percentage of the larger population.  And yet, that work is not being done in our Landlord-Tenant Courts.  They're not representing people in our Small Claims Courts or in cases involving workers' compensation benefits or any of the other, or any of the other foreclosure civil cases, any of the cases that, that deal with people's medical benefits, you know, life, liberty, sort of housing, things that are critical to someone's quality of life.  Those aren't where the lawyers are.  The lawyers are dealing with much of the cases in which there's a significant economic state.  We're in the criminal cases where we have an obligation that we pay lawyers to represent people.  The government pays lawyers to represent people, or in the federal government sector in lobbying, or in administrative litigation before the federal agencies--that's where a lot of the lawyers are.  But if you go to our Landlord-Tenant Court and you go to our Small Claims Court, or our Domestic Violence Unit, or you go into the foreclosure or other courts that deal with the problems poor people have--you don't find a lot of lawyers.  And that's what the Access to Justice Commission bringing it back around is designed to do.  How do we get lawyers and other--how do we provide services here at the court--self-help centers, through the Bar's cooperation, through pro bono, how do we get representation for that group of people?
Story_ID: 101329
Speaker 1: Okay.  How many appellate judges do you have here in [Washington] D.C. to handle this huge number of--
Speaker 2: When we are at full strength, we have nine, so nine appellate judges to handle that caseload.  And that's, that's, again, if we had discretionary authority, and discretionary jurisdiction to not hear some cases, that would probably be about the right complement because then you could--that or, or even a smaller number.  There are states that have High Courts that only have five judges or justices, or seven.  But if, but those jurisdictions have intermediate Courts of Appeal, or have very broad discretionary jurisdiction.  So, the intermediate Courts of Appeal deal with error correcting, so they're looking at it saying, did you let the--did you improperly admit this evidence or did you--and they, and they send those, they determine whether those are fair.  And then, the High Courts look at it and say, well the Court of Appeals looked at.  The Trial Court issued, you know, exercised this discretion, you know, we're not going to sit here and second-guess two levels of judiciary.  We're not going to even hear that cases.  There's not a legal issue there that our time should be spent on.  We don't have that luxury.  So, if somebody comes up and says the trial judge impermissibly failed to sever my trial from my co-defendant, or impermissibly admitted evidence into the record, we have to decide whether that trial was fair, like in an intermediate court.  But then, the overriding issues of, of whether, in a particular case, the Trial Court's denial of an appellant's opportunity to present an expert witness on DNA or anything else, so that the overriding issue of when the law demands or commands that, that certain evidence be presented, we also have to deal with that.  So, those are why, those--the, the breadth of the issues that we deal with on this court is what, what makes this court exciting because it's so varied and there's, you know, and because we're a General Jurisdiction Appellate Court.  We hear cases from the family divisions, civil cases, criminal cases, like in, for example, it's contrast.  In Maryland, they have a Special Court of Criminal Appeals.  So they have different courts for different, different types of appeals.
Speaker 1: But you hear everything--
Speaker 2: We hear everything.
Speaker 1: --and I was doing some primitive math here.  And I think it's like 300 cases per judge, but it's done in committees of three so.
Speaker 2: Right, right.  And it's, it's done over, you know, again, it's, it's not as though the case is filed and it's resolved immediately because part of that, the appellate resolution process is you have to have a record.  You have to have briefs, so a lot of it is--and then, then it comes in, and you have to get it calendared.  And, of course, you don't have that many days.  You can't, you can't hear cases every day 'cause you'd never be able to consider them or write opinions.  So, it's, it's an interesting court.  It's unique amongst Appellate Courts in the country, but it's, but it's one of the--I have a court of judges.  My colleagues, who I believe, intellectually, and in terms of their work ethic, are second to none--I mean brilliant.  There's not a court, including the United States Supreme Court, that I, that I would not hesitate to put my colleagues up against in terms of quality.  So, I'm, I'm blessed in the--and I think, again, it's going back to the system that nominates.  And given the nature of the legal profession in the District of Columbia, the quality of the lawyering here, we have outstanding candidates for judicial appointment.  And, and my colleagues, many of whom are former Supreme Court clerks and, and, you know, law review editors and, and graduates of top law schools who have been in solicitors offices in the--for the United States government in the Justice Department, or head of the Public Defender Services, Appellate Division, which is a premier public defender service in the country.  You know, these are just high-quality brilliant people.  And so, it makes a little bit easier 'cause I'm surrounded by such quality but, at the same time, even for them, it's, it's extremely burdensome.
Story_ID: 101330
Speaker 1: Okay.  And now if I lose an appeal to the D.C. Court of Appeals, where can I take it next?  I mean, is there another place to take it?
Speaker 2: You have the right to take it to the United States Supreme Court.  And the United States Supreme Court, of course, could grant cert.  There's no appeal as to matter of right, but you have the opportunity to file a petition of certiorari to the United States Supreme Court.  And over the last ten years, I think the United States Supreme Court has accepted maybe two, so, if you think we're deciding 1,600 to 1,800 cases a year over ten years, and they've taken two--maybe three cases from our court in all that time.
Speaker 1: Is it better to be in trouble in [Washington] D.C. and take a case to the D.C. Court of Appeals or, or maybe at some other state?  Is there--I mean, whether you describe the differences, I don't know.
Speaker 2: I don't, I don't think it impacts the quality.  I think we still give a great deal of consideration.  It's my understanding, for example, in Virginia, there's some criminal cases from which you can't even take a first level appeal if you're convicted.  So, I, I would suggest that the fact that we give merit review to every case probably means that your chances of having the fairest of trials, it probably occurs here, as opposed to other two-tier states, although I can't say that 'cause I, you know, again, I don't know what their processes are.  I just know what the outcome and how many cases they resolve.  It doesn't mean that they're not looking at them.  They may have a group of lawyers who work for the courts who are really going through these cases, and deciding there's no issue of appeal that's worthy of even, you know, because it was done fairly.  So, I'm not suggesting that other cases--other courts that don't have the same workload aren't giving fair justice to the citizens of those states.  What I'm saying is that they have the discretion to do it in a different way that is less burdensome than the way we have to do it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: On the face of things, I think I'd rather be in legal trouble here--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter)--I mean, from what you described.
Speaker 2: I, I believe, I believe we, we do our best to, to give everybody a fair shot, and, and at a fair trial.
Story_ID: 101331
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now, to what extent--oh, here's the next question I wrote down.  To what extent has the DNA usage today changed what goes on in the [D.C.] Court of Appeals and--
Speaker 2: Well, DNA evidence hasn't really affected how we do our job.  What DNA evidence has done is bring a certain amount of certainty that didn't exist before the science to convictions or acquittals of individuals who were charged with heinous acts.  And it has also impacted us because in those cases where DNA evidence is later--or evidence that is subject to DNA testing is later, now, now that the test exists, test exists to determine whether someone was actually at a location or committed a crime because of the, their being excluded from the pool of people who could have committed the crime because the DNA--it doesn't match theirs.  What it has done is it has led to appeals of prior convictions and, and the overturning of, of convictions, when the DNA evidence indicates that the conviction may have been wrongful.  But, but for us, what it has done is, it has made those appeals, or appeals from cases, for example, where DNA evidence excludes almost everyone, but the defendant from the scene or from the criminal conduct.  It has made certainly some of those issues of, of whether their--the defendant was, that actually committed a crime makes those issues less significant on appeal.  For example, if you had eye witnesses who are impeached with prior, prior inconsistent statements, you might want to believe that they didn't know what they were talking about, or they may have been a reasonable doubt, now that there--because of some prior misstatements.  But when you end up with DNA evidence that excludes everybody else from committing the crime, but the defendant, those, those issues are--when you're looking at the error of admitting perhaps of prior statement by someone, you say, well, was the error really--how come determinative?  Was that error harmless in the great scheme of things and then, and when you have DNA evidence that is strongly supportive of the guilt of the individual, you can more easily say that--well, the trial judge may have erred over here in letting the statement come in.  But it really--in the big scheme of things was harmless because we believe this jury would have convicted anyway because there's evidence of DNA.  This DNA evidence is so strong that he was involved in at the place that his, his defense, alibi defense, that he was in Baltimore [Maryland] with his girlfriend is, is not worthy of belief.
Speaker 1: Is there a way the court actually certifies the authenticity or the exactness of DNA evidence?
Speaker 2: Well, DNA evidence is--it is a science.  It--your genetic makeup, to the extent that it is relatively unique, can be determined by materials that are personal to you, meaning your sweat or your bodily fluids or skin, or almost anything because everything contains your DNA, that's part of you.  And so, there is the--there are scientists who can show the uniqueness of this DNA strand and compare it to what they believe the DNA--universes or people with that kind of strand and that excludes, you know, large percentages of the population because it's so unique.
Speaker 1: So, I guess what I'm asking, so the court appoint like a scientific expert to evaluate DNA evidence?
Speaker 2: Not this court.  The trial courts, the defendants, and the prosecutors because the prosecutors, of course, administer the justice.  They have a duty not to just convict people.  They have a duty to only convict guilty people.  They have experts.  And so, those experts are experts, scientific experts, the defense counsel can get DNA testing.  The courts will pay for it, if there's a reason to believe that the DNA testing, you know, if my defense is I wasn't there.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Right?
Speaker 1: But these, the--I'm talking about the actual, I know, laboratories or whatever that conduct this testing?
Speaker 2: Oh?
Speaker 1: They--are they like certified by the court or they--
Speaker 2: They're not--
Speaker 1: Do they have a--I mean, I know it's a scientific process but--
Speaker 2: But--
Speaker 1: --how do we know a scientist from a quack, you know, how do you certify--
Speaker 2: Oh, you know, we, we don't certify them ourselves although there is, there is a study.  Judge Ariel Alexander--Alexander, I'm sorry, that's not correct.  Judge Harry Edwards, from the United States District Court, who is a leading proponent of, of increasing the capacity of--and, and publicly funding in order to ensure scientific validity outside of the Justice Department of these testing procedures, would argue that we don't have enough.  But what we do have, and what the crucible of cross-examination in trial gives you is the opportunity to challenge what a DNA test may show.  So, defense counsel, if the government presents DNA evidence that this, that excludes everybody but your, but your client.  But you, you have the ability, through cross-examination, to test how accurate that test is by challenging how it was done, talking about the labs, credentials, the scientists' credentials.  And you can challenge that for the court and not get it admitted at all if it turns out to be unreliable evidence, or if it even gets before a jury.  The jury gets to hear why you think the test was improper, improperly done and not reflective of, of accurate information.  So, the trial itself provides the opportunity to challenge.
Story_ID: 101652
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, in 2009, you were selected for a second term as Chief Judge of the Court of Appeals.  What--and you were elected in 2011 as President of the Conference of Chief Justices.
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: Now, that's--this is a new organization.  Can you explain what that--
Speaker 2: Well, the Conference of Chief Justices is a group--is comprised of all of the top Chief Judges of the highest courts of the states and territories, and the District of Columbia in the country.  So, we are the highest judicial officers of every jurisdiction in the country, and not including Federal, not including Chief Justice [John] Roberts who is, of course, the Chief of the Federal System.  But it's all the state level, general jurisdiction high court Chiefs.  And our purpose is to, one, with shareholders of the National Center for State Courts which is our best practice institute.  We have--and it's located in Williamsburg, Virginia.  And its, its purpose--and it was established by Justice [Warren] Burger, Chief Justice Burger, of the Supreme Court.  But its purpose was to, to improve the quality of justice and, and to create best practices in the administration, fair administration of justice for state courts, like the federal courts have with the Administrative Office of the federal Courts.  And so, it, it has, it provides technical assistance, the National Center does.  And, and the Conference of Chief Justices are the Board of Directors of that, that institution.  So, we get together and we, we talk about issues impacting the courts, racial and ethnic bias, and what as national leaders, we should have the National Center focusing on, in order to alleviate some of those concerns, and what kind of studies and programs and technical assistance can they provide.  But we also take positions on Access to Justice, and perhaps resolutions calling on all of our colleagues and, and state legislators and federal legislators, to recognize the importance of increasing funding for civil legal services and legal aid, and to, to increase the opportunity for people who are facing life-changing legal issues to be represented by counsel.  So, where there's a criminal justice issue that it's sentencing, a disparate sentencing--while we may not be in the federal circuit system, we may call and pass a resolution calling upon them to normalize those sentences, and to treat equally and fairly, individuals who have been convicted of possession of, of drugs.  We may, you know, it's to the extent that it's a not calling on, or not chastising any particular state or jurisdiction but, but calling generally for fairness in the handling of, of cases.  So the--so as President, for example, the issues that I championed are language access in the courts.  More and more diverse populations are coming to our courts, and we don't turn them away 'cause they can't speak English.  We still have to resolve their disputes fairly, and we can't resolve anything in accordance with the law if we don't understand what they're saying what the problem is.  And yet, courts around the country, including this court, were facing large cuts in our funding.  The sequester automatically was cutting our budget, but in other states, because of financial circumstances they were facing, court budgets were being cut.  At the same time, court budgets are being cut, we're saying we need to move forward and provide interpreters.  Well, we don't even provide lawyers but, you know, so this is, there's a real difficulty in complying with our obligations, constitutional obligations, to hold fair trials.  And our--due process give, give constitutional due process to people if you can't understand them.  And at the same time, we don't have funding to help us with that.  And so, that's an issue that, that we took a stand on--addressed and worked, in fact, with the Justice Department, the ABA [American Bar Association], to come up with standards that, that allowed us to try to provide opportunity.  And then, what we did was we focused the National Center and its technical staff on developing technological fixes and standards for remote interpreting and other ways that jurisdictions can, who, you know, 'cause we're talking about a rural court in Georgia who has somebody who comes in speaking Hmong, who's been accused or has--is looking for relief from, and a circumstance in which they believe they were unfairly treated.  Okay, this is, you know, the clerk in the court (unclear) can't pay to bring an interpreter from Washington, D.C., fly him down, set him up for three days to hear this case, but justice demands that this individual's case be heard.  So, so what we will do as the, as the Conference of Chief Justices, and we, we will take a position and say, we've got to move in this direction.  And this is what's fair and just.  And we will, hopefully, move the, move the ball down the field a little bit more in terms of providing equal access to justice for everyone.
Story_ID: 101653
Speaker 1: So, I also became involved, I, I chair the Access, as you might guess, I chair the Conference of Chief Justices to this day, Access and Fairness Committee, Public Trust and Conference Committee.  And so, we focus on many issues, unconscious bias.  We passed a resolution encouraging jurisdictions to focus on the issue of unconscious bias, to train judges to understand and recognize that they might have biases, to train clerk staff and court staff in that area, so that they can at least be as cognizant as possible that when there may be biases creeping into how they handle or treat the public or make decisions.  I was involved also in pretrial justice reform.  And a resolution was passed calling on the, calling for the elimination, or calling for the use of evidence-based pretrial risk assessments, as opposed to money, in deciding who should be, be in jail, and not in jail during the time they're presumed innocent pretrial because are, you know, to me, the use of money is a port (ph.).  We don't use it here in the District of Columbia--no bail bondsman.  You, you are released because you are presumed innocent.  And we have assessed your risks as being--and it's only the risk of returning to court or committing another crime, as being within a range where we are satisfied the community can tolerate it.  And we put in other processes to ensure that you come back to court--maybe it's ankle bracelets, maybe it's home confinement, maybe it's checking in by calling your probation officer every day, or your pretrial services agent every day.  Whatever it is that ensures that you know when your court date is, and that you are, you know, stay-aways from different communities where you might have committed crimes in the past.  Whatever it is, we have a range of opportunities.  And, and evidence now shows empirical evidence.  Scientific evidence now shows that the use of these kinds of methods to ensure safety of the community, return to court, and at the same time, giving a defendant an opportunity to actually prepare a defense, which is sort of, since they're presumed innocent, a critical component of a fair justice system.  Those things are better served by not using money that doesn't do anything but imprison poor people, 'cause the big time drug dealers and the white collar criminals are never going to be held in jail.  Who's going to be held in jail--the woman who makes an hourly wage, minimum wage who's, who's charged with theft, and can't get out of jail to take care of her family, to take care for her kids, which throws all sorts of costs on the system for no reason because the likelihood is that she won't commit another crime, and that she will come to court.  And she is presumed to be innocent of the crime she's been charged with at that point.  So, that's an, that's an issue for me, as you can tell, that's, that I continue to work on.  And I work with the National Center because during my ten years as--and right after I, I served as President, the Conference of Chief Justices, passed resolutions supporting the use of evidence-based pretrial risk assessments, as opposed to money for release conditions.  So, now we pressed that across the country.
Speaker 2: Yeah, this increasingly sounds like a better place to be in trouble than other places.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).  Well, I think that, and we're trying, we're trying to get other places to recognize this.  And, and a guy--a lot of it is to do with--we now have validated tests that can, that can tell a judge about risk, but the bail bonds has a significant lobby.  Those are businesses.  They lobby legislators, so you can't just evaluate.  You can't change the system.  The courts don't have the authority to just--they, they do have some authority, but there's, there's a lot that goes into, and it's a gutsy move for judges who are protected by just saying $50,000 bond.  You committed, you are alleged to have committed a robbery--$50,000 bond, and then put him in jail.  I mean, that, that doesn't put the judge at risk at all because even if you make the $50,000 bond, you say, well, look, I, I gave him a bond.  He made it.  That's the standard bond for people who are accused of committing robbery, so I've done what I can do.  Judges here, unless the government asks for somebody to be held without bond and proves by clear, convincing evidence that they are a danger to the community and others, we have a presumption of release.  We have, we, we release them.  And we've been doing that for years.  And I don't think our recidivism rate amongst those individuals while they're out, or rates of failure to appear in court are, are anything, but comparable to any other jurisdiction in the country and probably higher than most.  But we've, we've been doing it for thirty years.
Speaker 2: That's (unclear).
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Story_ID: 101654
Speaker 1: Let, let me ask you about the state of American justice for African Americans.  By serving on this committee, you know, this commission, I'm sorry, the Conference of Chief Justices--I mean, do you have any sense of the--where, of where, African American people are in the most jeopardy?  We are still the highest prison population by a percentage of our population--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and America is still the country that incarcerates more of its people than any other country on earth.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So, what, what's your sense?
Speaker 2: You know, it's, it's a very difficult question.  It's a multifaceted question.  It goes beyond the courts.  You know, to policies established by, you know, our political leadership, but it's also, where is the police resources?  Where did--so the decisions by where we're going to put resources.  And it's also--and, and where we think because, again, I'm, I'm in a poor community.  Just become I'm in a poor community, I don't want--I want police there.  I want them to protect me 'cause I am one of the people who was trying to live my life in accordance with the law.  So it's not as though when I say, targeting resources--it's not as though I don't want them there.  But at the same time, we've got to look at alternatives to incarceration.  And I think one of the things--we had talked about evidence-based risk assessment.  The Conference of Chief Justices, for example, has been very strongly--they've run evidence-based sentencing modalities.  And evidence-based sentencing, like evidence-based risk assessment, has shown us that incarceration is actually counter-productive to the safety and security of a community, and to the well-being of this country.  In many, many respects, there are some people who should be locked up.  Don't get me wrong.  But we are locking up vast majorities of individuals who should not be locked up because there are better outcomes that can be achieved if the money is used in different ways.  But if you're running, if you're running as a "tough on crime" politician, do you care to hear that?  When I put money in the jails, and I can show I'm putting these people away who have hurt somebody, that's a, that's a tough counter-argument to--a tough argument to counter.  But I think that there is a wealth for anybody who wants to look at it.  There is just undeniable evidence that the mass incarceration of people for most of the crimes, for which we incarcerate them, is ridiculous, counter-intuitive and, and ultimately, hurts our country.  But much like those who deny climate change (laughter), it doesn't matter that you have 99 percent of the world scientists saying there's climate change.  There is a group of people who just are distrustful, or won't believe it, and some of them are in positions of authority because they have influences and interests that, that they wish to protect.  And it's an easy way to do it.  So, I think the same thing is true in the criminal justice system.  More and more, though, and I think the Conference of Chief Justices have led the, have led the way in a lot of--in this respect.  Evidence-based sentencing practices are becoming much more involved, much more a part of the state court sentencing processes, okay.  So, I think that, and that's 95 to 98 percent of all criminal cases in the country are in state courts.  So, I think you're going to see and you have, and I'm, I would suspect, given--assuming to have some money to put in the alternatives because, again, it's--there's--it's the ying and the yang here.  You can't, you can't just start not punishing people under the theory that putting them in jail is worse than not punishing them if they've committed a crime.  So, punishment and rehabilitation and those concepts, and what can be accomplished now with technology outside of an institution, is what we're talking about.  How do you help people through who have committed crimes to not be drags on society for the rest of their lives, you know?  And, and alternative sentencing, one of the things that states have pioneered is sort of pre-adjudication probation where courts have allowed you to, allowed individuals to enter guilty pleas, but agree to get rid of those guilty, to, to not, but the government agrees to drop the charges if you complete a particular practice or process or the courts.  That's, that's--if they--it's a pre-adjudication system.  If it's a post-adjudication, the courts will wipe out your, or vacate your guilty sentence because you've completed a non-incarceration program in which you've, you've, you've satisfied the court that you're on the right path.  So there's benefits in many ways.
Story_ID: 101655
Speaker 1: So, for instance, a person who's convicted of domestic violence may go through some sort of psychological counselling or, or (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Anger management, psychological counseling, and they have demonstrated through other activities in--that they have learned, and that they, that whatever the social problems that caused them to think that any women or, or engaged in this conduct was okay because of the way they were raised or whatever, has been corrected.  Why saddle them with an assault charge on their--and a criminal conviction on their record 'cause that, again, costs society, 'cause the opportunity to get employed, or to maintain employment is, is impacted.  So those things are being thought of by the Chief Justices across the country who are in a position, as I am, to help make policy in their local jurisdictions and, of course, through this organization [Conference of Chief Justices], and through the National Center for State Court to, to promote policies that are fair.
Speaker 1: I know Virginia, I don't know about Maryland, but Virginia, less than ten miles from here, you can--I mean, they used to, they have, I believe, still truth in sentencing where you got--people get hard time and where no appeal, or any of that, so completely different from what you described for D.C. Court of Appeals (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Right.  They're--we've, we've, for the most part--our counsel and I think, with the leadership of the courts, have gotten rid of mandatory minimums in many, many cases.  The old three strikes and out, we don't have.  You know, the old three strikes, you're out, law, you know.  We do have truth in sentencing though, but our truth in sentencing really goes to making it clear when you sentence someone that they're going to serve the sentence you gave them.  So, we have, we used to have ranges so, for example, I might sentence you to a period of incarceration of three to nine years.  That's my sentence.  And within that three to nine years, you may get, you may get time off for good time credits because you've been doing something great, or prior service on a related charge, for which you are also being held in this charge or you may, because you take certain courses.  Parole may consider that as a way of lessening the sentence you have in jail to--from the three, closer to the three than the nine.  But that was a system in which people said, well, we don't know what that means.  You mean, I sentenced somebody for three to nine years, but they could be out in two and a half, or they could be out in five, or they could be out in four.  I, I--there's not enough transparency to that.  And so, we've moved to sentences where--are definitive sentences--you're going to be there for four years.  And you will be there for the whole four years because that's fair.  But not a circumstance where we're--we ever are in a position of having to, unless somebody's convicted of a crime that carries a life sentence, where we, where we lock the door, and throw away the key without any consideration of, of their opportunities to improve themselves.
Story_ID: 101656
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, 2013, at age sixty, the appropriate age to be a judge (laughter), you were selected again for your third consecutive term as Chief Judge--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --of the Court of Appeals here.  What are--are you looking forward to, in the future, how many more years do you think you want to serve, and what are some of the challenges as you go forward?
Speaker 2: Well, I don't know how many more years I'll, I'll serve.  I, I've served longer than a judge than anything else I've ever done (laughter) in my life.  But at least, I've had the pleasure and the opportunity to serve both as a trial court judge and an appellate judge.  I, I love what I do.  I think I make a difference.  This is a great place to be--as I've said, a fabulous court.  The, you know, there, there--I've always been involved in politics, which I have not been able to be involved in since becoming a judge.  So, to a large degree, there're policy or things that are important to me that I can't, that don't, that don't necessarily impact on the improvement of the, of the law or the administration--fair administration of justice, which is where my limitations are now.  I, I can talk about things, like pretrial justice reform and, and the elimination of bonds because, to me, that improves the fair administration of justice.  And it's, and it is in accord with my obligations and responsibilities as a judicial leader.  But that's the limitation on my political speech.  And, and I don't know that, that I don't still have an inkling to go back.  Remember, I got to Washington [D.C] being as a, as a, because I was involved in somebody's campaign.  And, and I, I got advantages because I was elected official here as a Democratic State Committee official and, and those led to, you know, larger perspectives and, and opportunities on the national level through the DNC and, ultimately, to my appointment.  So, I, I'm not sure that I've ever gotten all of it out of my system.  I was a political science major at Tufts University [Medford, Massachusetts].  So, I don't know what I'm going to be doing, but I do know that there are challenges still facing the court system.  We are still, although we have been very well-supported generally by both the President and Congress in terms of our needs, funding-wise, and I, I can't say enough about the willingness of the chairs over the years.  And, again, I've had different chair, depending on who's in power in Congress, and who's on the committees that, that fund our courts.  But we've had a lot of support from them.  Of course, our own delegate, Eleanor Holmes Norton, has been very helpful to us and very supportive of us.  And so, we've, we've been able to make it comfortably relative to other government, state government judicial systems, who have had, who had tremendous downturns in their economic circumstances in the states that's directly impacted our courts' ability to provide services.  For example, in some states, they've cut jury trials, or delayed them six months because they don't have enough money to run their court system.  Well, we don't have that problem, so I'm thankful to that and thankful to those but, but we do have challenges.  Going forward, we have more and more people who are appearing pro se, as I've said, so we're still addressing (unclear) Access to Justice issues.  Personally, in terms of court administration, this court, despite its advantages, still doesn't have full electronic filing.  So, access to, to documents, and electronic filing is something that I'm hopeful will be implemented in this court before the end of this year.  And, but that was a challenge that I, I needed to complete.  That was something I began, and I, hopefully, will complete it before I resign, retire, or am forced out (laughter), whatever comes first.  No, but, but, no, seriously, it's something that I want to accomplish, so that's a reason that I sought a third term.  Another reason I sought a third term was because, as I've said, were the transparency brought about by moving the court, which is a huge policy decision, to have some live video streaming of arguments, is something that will be accomplished this year, and something I'm very proud to have had a part in.  And, but it was something that would, was not finished.  We were not doing any--have not had it done yet, when my term ended, my second term ended so.  And then, generally, I, I want to make sure the court maintains its fiscal strength and its progressive policies in terms of its efforts to provide services when lawyers aren't available to those who are unrepresented, and to, to continue to encourage through whatever I can do since I don't control the trial court.  There is a Chief Judge of the Trial Court--Chief Judge [Lee F.] Satterfield does a fabulous job.  But through the policies of the court in terms of making it possible for him to be innovative, I want to continue to try and do those things.
Story_ID: 101657
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now, when you look back on everything you've done at this point, was there any major step or thing that you would do differently if you could go back and change it?
Speaker 2: I'm sure there is.  I just can't think of it right now (laughter).  I'm not sure there's anything I would have done dramatically differently.  There's probably ways I could have done it better.  I was able to, and I have been able to accomplish most of the things that I wanted to or believed we should accomplish.  Since my tenure, since I became Chief Judge, I think I've, I've gotten, not only a great deal of support, as I said, from my colleagues here, but because I served on a Trial Court bench and because I, I still maintain my relationships there, though I review their decisions, you know.  And because I have community ties that I think are strong from my days involved in the community, more actively, and there, and continue to, help continue, my continued involvement in the community, I, I think I've, I've sought advice, and I've moved in directions that have been successful.  For the most part, I can't think of any efforts I've undertaken that were important to me that we haven't made some progress on, so I feel very blessed about that.  But I, so I have no real regrets about anything or how I handled anything to this point.

Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  One other thing that you did here as a Chief Judge was you presided over the renovation of the historic Courthouse here.  Tell us, give us some of the history of this place and (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Oh, my goodness.  This, this is a fabulous structure.  It's the fourth oldest public building in all of Washington, D.C., built before the Capitol, built before the United States Supreme Court.  It was built here on the site of the Judiciary Square as Pierre [Charles] L'Enfant laid out the city, the Federal City.  My belief is that his original vision was for this to be the site of the United States Supreme Court because it would have been equal distance--right between the Capitol to our east, and the White House to our west overlooking the, the Federal, the National Mall.  It sits on a hill with this building and, and it's a prime location.  And, but it was chosen and the first structure built here was this building.  And it was the original City Hall for the City of Washington, and it was also the original courthouse.  As a courthouse, it has a, an incredible history of important trials involving very famous historical figures in the, in our country's history.  And, but it's, it's particularly important to me that this house, this building, not only sits on the National Registry of Historic Places, but on the National Underground Railroad Registry.  And it's because it served as a location for some very important trials during the, the Civil War era, and during the period of, of emancipation in the District for slaves, not only here in the District of Columbia, but in the country.  And it has been the home, in fact, for some of the leading, and especially, one, Frederick Douglass.  It was his--he served or held his office here when he was the U.S. Marshal and, and the Recorder of Deeds for the District of Columbia in one of his many historic positions.
Story_ID: 101339
Speaker 1: Okay.  Yeah, we got a whole bunch of other things we (unclear) off camera.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).  Well, we were talking about the rich history of this building [Historic Courthouse] and, and the fact that it's on the National Registry of Historic Places, but also on the National Underground Railroad Registry.  And, and I was talking about the fact that Frederick Douglass had an office here.  And that there were several important cases, were tried in this courthouse during the 1800s and, and particularly, involving issues surrounding slavery.  And, and what most people don't know, talking about those cases is and, and it's, it's fascinating to see their faces when I ask them this question.  I asked often, when people visit the Courthouse, where was the largest mass attempt, of escape attempt, by slaves in North America from?  Where, where did that happen--the largest attempted mass escape by slaves?  And then, they are shocked when I tell them it was here in the District of Columbia.  The District of Columbia was a, a slave state and the (unclear) story of two sisters primarily who were slaves here in the District of Columbia, but involves a abolitionist captain from Pennsylvania, a sea captain, who was actually, to a large degree, brought to [Washington] D.C. by freed slaves who had economic wealth because of, of the jobs they did here in the District of Columbia, and with the help of some white abolitionists, sailed the ship up here into the heart of the Potomac River.  And one night, hundreds of slaves attempted to escape--unfortunately, because it was a schooner.  And the wind died before they could get out into the bay and up along the Atlantic Ocean, up to Pennsylvania, and to the freed states.  Their ship was captured.  And the captain, Daniel Drayton, and his first mate were tried in this Courthouse for, under various anti-, I mean, various laws dealing with stealing property and other things.  And the case was tried here.  They were actually acquitted of most of the most serious crimes, believe it or not, but were convicted of some minor crimes and incarcerated.  And, ultimately, which is the most interesting thing, because it was the only thing that I've ever heard in, or that I, that I know about this particular President.  They were, they were ultimately pardoned--he and his first mate, ultimately pardoned by President Millard Fillmore.  And when you ask people, what is Millard Fillmore--what did Millard Fillmore do as President?  You now know that one of the things he did, which was so critical, was he, he pardoned the captain and first mate of, of the ship that, that was attempting to move African Americans in the District of Columbia who were, who were enslaved to freedom.
Speaker 1: Was this in the early 1860s (unclear) (simultaneous).  Well, well, 18--
Speaker 2: Yes, 18-, this was in the 1850s--
Speaker 1: Fifties, all right.
Speaker 2: --I believe.
Speaker 1: So, wasn't during the war but before the war?
Speaker 2: No, right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They also held trials involving the Fugitive Slave Act.  And, interestingly, the District of Columbia abolished slavery in 1850 [sic, 1862]--I believe it was, right at, you know, at--that's around the same time.  I'm not exactly sure what the dates were, but the Fugitive Slave Act was still the law of the country.  And you could not harbor slaves from Virginia in the District of Columbia.  It was challenged in the court here in the District of Columbia.  The Fugitive Slave laws, despite the abolition of the slaves in the District of Columbia, were upheld.  Subsequently, President [Abraham] Lincoln appointed and reorganized the courts here in the District of Columbia and created the District of Columbia Supreme Court--appointed four judges to it.  And those judges, when faced with a subsequent Fugitive Slave Act case, split two to two on its applicability and its--and thus opened the door for the Fugitive Slave Act to be repealed.  And so, that slaves escaping from the South could come to the District of Columbia and not--there would not be a requirement that the slaves be returned.  It was interesting to watch "12 Years A Slave"--and the idea that it's an African American man, was lured to the District of Columbia, and then basically kidnapped probably was in response to the, the notion that no longer could they, you know, that, that the Fugitive Slave Act and the opportunity to bring people back, to bring people into slavery.  Of course, he wasn't a slave--was something that was being done on a regular basis.  But, yeah, that case, but that case, which ultimately, as I said, led--I think, was the beginning of the downfall of the Fugitive Slave Act, and led to its repeal, was held here.
Story_ID: 101340
Speaker 1: The--there were several other cases, but one of the other things that this, that is anecdotal.  And so, all the Lincoln-philes who, who wanted to take exception--I acknowledge this is anecdotal upfront.  The District of Columbia, the slaves were freed in the District of Columbia before slavery was abolished nationally through the Emancipation Proclamation.  They passed--President Lincoln signed the D.C. Emancipation and Compensation Act.  The original concept was we're going to free the slaves in the District of Columbia, and in order to prevent there from being any court cases or other allegations of improper conduct, we're going to pay them for, for freeing their slaves since, of course, slaves were still considered to be property.  And so, it was almost--I, I liken it to eminent domain.  The right thing to do--we're taking this because it was the right thing to do.  Of course, in eminent domain, it's because we have a legitimate government purpose for this property, and but we're going to pay you for it.  And, and that's how that Act, according to anecdotal really, based on information and belief, was signed here in, in this Courthouse.  Thus, the slaves--the document that free slaves in the District of Columbia was signed here in this Courthouse, then became the site for those Compensation Act hearings.  That's part of the infamous history because the judges in this Courthouse were then putting values on people's lives in compensating slave owners for, for their property.  But, you know, that's--it's an important part of our history.  And this Courthouse was the scene of, of some of that, that history.
Speaker 2: This place was built in the 1820s?
Speaker 1: This built--this place was built in 1820.  The construction began in 1820.
Speaker 2: Okay, probably with slave labor, I would guess.
Speaker 1: I would not, I would guess that is correct, as was with the, as was the Capitol.  And this building was designed by the architect of the Capitol who would, who later became the architect of the Capitol, I guess.
Speaker 2: Right.  I've, I've seen a special about--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --the American masters of the--but I can't think of his name now but--
Speaker 1: And, and as neither can I, but it's on the cornerstone (laughter).  And it's in my history somewhere.  I just can't remember it.
Story_ID: 101341
Speaker 1: Okay.  We always ask this question.  What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, I, I have so many.  How do I condense this?  I think, I think my biggest hope for the African American community is that we will continue to pursue policies that further, greater educational opportunities, because I think that, that the correlation of poverty and education is undeniable.  I, I also hope that the provision of healthcare will increase the opportunity for us to provide better care for families and, thus, give us a more of an opportunity, health-wise, to make, to, to be impactful in this, in, in the country.  Too many African Americans die much too young, and many with promise, and many because they just don't have adequate healthcare.  And, and so, I think that's a critical, critical component of the health of the community.  From the perspective of, of the law, I think recognizing that there are alternatives to incarceration, that there's impacts that go beyond--the impacts on the community that go beyond.  And I'm not talking about just the African American community, but the greater community that go beyond the, the limited period of incarceration for most of these offenses, and impact on the long-term health and of families and, and is, and, and in the ability of families to thrive is, is something that will continue to evolve, but, hopefully, will be of importance.  And, and it will have a positive impact on, on communities of color and families.  My fear, of course, is that we never seem to be able to get past race as a, as a larger community.  We can't comfortably talk about it.  We don't acknowledge it in a way that's, that will lead to healthy, and healthy resolution of, of an issue that confounds us now 300 years later.  It is, it is a difficult thing, but it is a necessary thing.  And so I, you know, I, I worry that recent expressions--now, hopefully, that's generational, and clearly, you can look at some of the recent statements by Donald Sterling and, and Rancher (ph.), and others who have, have let their racial animus come to the fore.  But I, but I do see in my own children and in their friends--a, a blending, a much more, a much deeper, and appropriately equal sense and bond between younger people today.  And, and they're not seeing race as being determinant of anything and, and looking more to the character of people.  So, [Reverend Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.]'s old hopes and dreams remain I think, my hope and dream, and to be judged by the content of your character, not by the color your skin, but we still have a ways to go.
Story_ID: 101342
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, like when you look back again at your career and everything you've done to this point, what do you consider today to be your professional legacy?
Speaker 2: I, I hope that when people think of me as a judge, they think of me as someone who was fair and thoughtful and caring and temperate as a judge.  I, I also want them to think of me as someone who cared about Access to Justice and, and its broadest parameters, you know.  How do I assure that those people who come to court because we are where disputes are resolved in a democracy.  And we are the keepers of the rule of law, and the, and the protectors of the rule of law that, they will, they will think of my tenure in the legal profession, not just as a judge, as being one that is promoting those ideals.  And, and I also, because, of course, you know, it's difficult when you're sitting here, continuing to work, to talk about legacy, and, and what people will think of you.  I, I hope that when they think of our courts, if they do think of me, they will think of them as, as an open and accessible and to the extent that any court could be welcoming place that, that treated their concerns seriously.
Story_ID: 101343
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Tell us something about your family now.  You're married--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and you have like three children?
Speaker 2: I'm married.  I have three children.  My wife [Cheryl Washington], my best friend, but also I, I should have probably said this at the beginning.  I, I never would have been a judge without the support, of course, of my wife because I did it at an age that it was not the age that I, respecting my family, was still young.  My wife had to continue to work because this [Washington, D.C.] is a very expensive area to live in.  And to leave a law firm to go to do public service, which was a passion for me, but certainly didn't provide the, the economic security that I would have wanted to provide for my family--made it necessary for my wife to--and not that she didn't want to--I mean, she was working before she married me.  It wasn't as though she wanted to, to stop working, but certainly, she had to--she understood that my pursuing this opportunity meant that, that was going to be a long-term deal, and not a short-term deal.  And, but we've raised three children.  We've been married almost thirty years, thirty years next year.  And, you know, we're, we've been very blessed.  But she's, she was a, actually a vice-president for governmental, governmental affairs for UPS.  And before that, was a staffer in the, on the Senate side of, of Congress, Transportation Committee.  And so, she was a very--is very accomplished in her own right.  And so, I'm fortunate to have had a partner to help me and support me certainly, but in supporting the family also.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Is there anything we have not covered before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: There might be, but I can't think of it.  I thought this has been pretty comprehensive.
Story_ID: 101344
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  The last question is similar to legacy, but a little more personal.
Speaker 2: Uh-hum.
Speaker 1: Sir, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: Well, I'd like to be remembered as somebody who cared about people, and somebody who believed very much in the rule of law, and its, and the impact of, of the law to, to change lives, and that I, that I was faithful to, to that belief, and in my judicial rulings and dealings and in my outreach to the community.  That's, that's really how I want to be remembered, and as a good person, as, as somebody who people, who knew people, who knew, who could express and, and people could understand, cared about them.  So I, I, that's what I, I want to be, you know, real simple on the tombstone--he was a good man.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, thank you very much.
Speaker 2: Thank you. Appreciate it.
