 Little Thunder  Bieri  Today is October 30, 2013. I   m interviewing Art Bieri on behalf of the  Oklahoma Oral History Program at Oklahoma State University. Art,  you   re an OSU alum and went on to make major contributions in the  areas of physical education and libraries within the Stillwater system.  Your efforts had a ripple effect throughout the state. You served in the  Air Force in Korea, were a member of the Governor   s Council on  Physical Fitness, received the Red Cross Bronze Medallion award, have  published a few books, and that   s just a few of your achievements. Thank  you for taking the time to talk with me.  You   re welcome. Thank you.  Where were you born, and where did you grow up?  I was born in New York City in 1931. My dad was a milkman in New  York, and my mother was a housewife. I have a brother who lives in  Pennsylvania, and my twin sister lives in Flower Mound, Texas. I have a  younger sister who lives in Roanoke, Virginia. After we were born, then  we moved to New Jersey. My dad had a job with Sheffield Farms, a  milk company, and transferred from New York. We grew up in  Plainfield, New Jersey. Then we moved down to Long Branch, New  Jersey, and we lived a block and a half from the Atlantic Ocean.  So how old were you when you made the move from  Plainfield  to     We were in grade school. We were anywhere from second, third grade,  fourth, then on up.  Right. That was basically your first time seeing the ocean, wasn   t it?  Had you seen it before?  Yes, that was the first time. That   s right. We were a block and a half  5  Little Thunder  Bieri  Little Thunder  Bieri  Little Thunder  Bieri  Little Thunder  Bieri  Little Thunder  Bieri  Little Thunder  Bieri  away. That was our playground. We grew up there. We learned how to  swim there. We spent all year, every day just about, even though it was  snowing or hurricane. Teachers used to tell us at school,    We have a  hurricane coming on, and be sure you don   t go close to the water.    Well,  we were right there. We had no other choice. (Laughter)  You wanted to see. (Laughs)  Yes, and we did, too. When those waves came on in, and you got the  backlash of the water, it would catch you.  So did you teach yourself to swim? Did you get swimming lessons?  Combination?  I taught myself to swim in the ocean, and then I took a lifesaving class in  Asbury Park, New Jersey, and worked on the beach front. When I got  into college, I was in physical education here at OSU, and I took  extensive instruction from Dr. A. B. Harrison.  Just to back up a little bit, in high school, you were already sort of  showing an interest in fitness and athletics.  Yes, I attributed that from my uncle, Pete Shula. He was a football coach  and won the state championship in New York State. It rubbed on me all  through my growing up years. I just admired him so much. He was a  graduate from Manhattan University and was an ensign in the Navy.  Before you went to college, you served in Korea.  Yes.  I understand that you organized sports activities, as well as were in  charge of some of the entertainment.  Yes. There were USO shows that came on through when it seemed to be  okay to come on through. Marilyn  Monroe  was one of them. I was  responsible to set up volleyball courts, basketball courts, track, indoor  facilities, you know, checkers, and dominoes, things like that. They had  all that available. I would order these particular items as necessary for  the program itself and special services.  Why was it important to have sports on the base?  Well, because you want to try to keep away from what could happen at  any time, and that was always hard to do.  6  Little Thunder  Bieri  Little Thunder  Bieri  Little Thunder  Bieri  Little Thunder  Bieri  Little Thunder  Bieri  Little Thunder  Bieri  You mean mentally?  Mentally, that was real hard. Then there was times you couldn   t do a  thing but just be at your bunker, be in your tent. I got the use of all that.  Because you were under fire.  Oh, yes. There was always that possibility, sure. As a matter of fact, I  designed one of the basketball courts that we had on base. We were  getting ready to play a basketball game. There was another official and I,  both of us in the military, of course. All of a sudden I heard  imitates  clicking sound . We were getting shot at from the mountains, and the  mountains were right around us. I mean, we were right on the 38th  Parallel. I said to the teams,    This game is canceled,    so we went to our  bunkers.  I understand that you organized the sports program for military children  and Korean children, as well. Can you talk about that?  Not for Korean children and not for people on base because it was only  men and nurses on the base. There weren   t any children there.  I was  across a road from a MASH unit.   Oh, okay, I misread that or something.  It was just the men on the base. There was no children. I didn   t do  anything with the Korean children.  Did you know, coming out of the service, that once you got into college  you would be interested in physical education?  Yes, surely. I was in, at that time, three years. I was in Korea in    53, and  then I rotated back to the States. I knew I was going to go on to college.  As a matter of fact, I had written to the University of Bridgeport in  Connecticut. It was the school for physical education, and I got accepted  while I was in the military. The commanding officer wanted me to stay  in and go to OCS.  Which was? Can you tell us what OCS was?  Officer Candidate School. I didn   t take it. That   s one of the regrets, but  you never know how it would end. I was rotated back to the United  States, and Oklahoma had a vacancy for my MOS  military occupational  specialty , which is the code that you have, like in Special Services. I  was assigned to Altus Air Force Base. I spent thirteen months there in  Altus, Oklahoma, and then I got discharged. I had a really good career in  7  Little Thunder  Bieri  Little Thunder  Bieri  Little Thunder  Bieri  Little Thunder  Bieri  Little Thunder  Bieri  Little Thunder  Bieri  the Air Force. I just really enjoyed it. I met my wife at that time.  In Altus?  She was from Hobart, Oklahoma. There was an Air Force dance. I met  her there, and we got together. At that time, she was teaching at Guymon  High School, and then she got a job at OSU. At that time, it was A M,  Oklahoma A M  College . I got discharged and went back to New  Jersey and worked and then came out here. In November of    55, we got  married and then had Donna and eventually John.  So you went to school on the GI Bill. How exactly did that work?  After I got discharged, you had to get back to the service organizations  and submit your paperwork and everything, and they would send you a  check every month. I believe the check was about  134 a month, and  that carried me through college.  Did it cover both classes and living expenses, or just living expenses?  Well, Alvena, my former wife, she was working at the university.  Between the two checks, we made it through, food-wise and rent and all,  and gradually moved into another apartment, and gradually got a house  in Stillwater.  Now, the whole concept of physical education, I believe, was sort of new  back then. I wonder if you can explain how the field came into being,  some of the changes that it reflected in society.  I learned a lot about physical education, even more so when I got into  college. During that period of time, I took a lot of intensity in what I did  in classes. As far as physical education being in the state, Oklahoma  wasn   t doing well at all.  How long had it been a field of study in the rest of the country?  Oh, a hundred years or more.  Really? That long?  Yes, yes, and there were so many top schools in physical education, and  we had so many great people coming out of the schools. Springfield  College in Massachusetts was one. That   s where James Naismith taught.  Then he finally came to Kansas. Notre Dame was well-known, and there  are several other schools.  8  Little Thunder  Bieri  Little Thunder  Bieri  Little Thunder  Bieri  Little Thunder  Bieri  The main thing, when people talked about physical education, it was  throwing a ball out and just watching, but when you talk about really  good physical education, I learned that here at Oklahoma State, at A M.  My teachers were real dedicated teachers, to make good teachers out of  you to do the job. We didn   t talk throwing the ball out. We talked about  good teaching, good supervision, good instruction, caring for the  children, learning about the anatomy, kinesiology because you   re  dealing directly with children.  Hands-on was there, and it was accepted. Hands-on was accepted. You  had to touch children in tumbling and swimming to get them to feel the  movement, and there was no kinds of disgraceful things. I have never,  literally never, had any kind of a problem in handling children because I  had no intent any other way but to get them to feel what I want them to  feel, and that relationship came about. So anyway, when I came from  Cushing and Valerie Colvin had recommended me here in Stillwater     you   ll see that in the documentary.  Right, and you had done some student teaching in Cushing, right?  Yes, I did. I did for two years.  Your first student teaching, what was that like?  It was terrific. I was at junior high school, and I also taught in the  elementary, but I had junior high students as my main. I taught physical  education. I coached basketball and coached track and football and had a  great career, just so good. I had good people. They believed in me, and I  believed in them. We never crossed swords. That wasn   t the intent. The  intent was really working with kids and handling them.  What had Valerie Colvin taught you that you took into your student  teaching?  She was so wonderful, and, ironically, when you talk about the Colvin  Center, people don   t know if it is a man or a woman. They don   t know.  They did back when because she was your teacher. She was bright, and  she was spicy.  And there weren   t a lot of women teaching in that area, I don   t imagine.  Back then, when I was going to school, there were quite a few at the  university. Pauline Winter, deceased. Oh, my gosh sakes, I   m losing the  thought, but there were many good women at the university level under  Valerie Colvin.  9  Little Thunder  Bieri  Little Thunder  Bieri  Little Thunder  Bieri  Little Thunder  Bieri  Little Thunder  Bieri  Little Thunder  Bieri  What made her stand out?  She was aggressive. She believed in physical education. She believed in  good teaching, and she would tell you if you did something wrong. It  made you feel bad, you were embarrassed a lot of times, but it paid off.  It just paid off every time because she knew a better way than what you  were doing, and she wanted that to be promoted. She was a stand-out  person and petite. Very aggressive. I did my field problem under her.  What was that?  A field problem was developing three areas in a physical education  program. That was in rhythms, games, and tumbling.  Now, this is at the master   s level, right?  It was. It was my master   s degree.  After you   ve left Cushing as a student teacher, and you   ve come back to  OSU.  That   s right, and I did my master   s work. She was my adviser, and she  had me do a field problem. That was the study of the problems of  rhythm, tumbling, and games. Ironically, in the game part of it, I wrote  and originated games for children.  You created your own games?  Some games that I had invented, originated, I gave to How We Do It  Game Book, promoted by the American Association for Health, Physical  Education,  Recreation and Dance . There   s copies I gave on a  professional level just for them without any reimburse.  How did you know that your games would work? Did you try them out  on your fellow students?  I had to try them out to see if they would work, and I watched children  playing when I was teaching. I drew some of the games that I was  teaching the children from Macmillan Publishing Company and other  companies, and they wanted to charge me twenty-five to fifty dollars a  game for me to be able to use it. I said,    I can   t afford to do that. I   ll see  if I can invent my own.    In my book, I did give credit to those people,  not so much for getting their games. The professional contribution, I,  eventually, when I developed the game, gave it to them.  The other thing on that was, I tried the games out that I invented on my  10  Little Thunder  Bieri  Little Thunder  Bieri  Little Thunder  Bieri  Little Thunder  Bieri  Little Thunder  Bieri  Little Thunder  Bieri  classes. I had good supervision. I protected the children. I wanted to see  how they moved, and I would stop things if it wasn   t going the way it  should go in this particular game. I wrote many games. I experimented  with those games for, oh, fifteen years. It took me five years to write the  book.  To make sure they were really good.  They were. They were wonderful games. It sold a lot back in 1972 and  before. It sold a lot of copies.  I want to follow up a bit because I   m not sure I heard you say that you  would draw, as well, when you were first getting your ideas for the  games?  I did, and the original sketches were Xs and Os and the writings to go  along with the Xs and Os. I have that in my file. I submitted that to a  publishing company. It was Lear Siegler Fearon Publishing Company in  Palo Alto, California. The company eventually burned down, but I did  get the book published. They bought the manuscript, paid for all of the  publication. It went into seven countries and all throughout the United  States. It   s still going. I have copies right here.  That   s quite an accomplishment, and this is right after receiving your  master   s degree, I guess.  Yes, after that. The reason that the company didn   t accept my sketches is  because I had not had a degree in art.  But you had artistic interests.  A lot, and I did so much cartooning all through those years. I have ones  of that to show you. But the book hit real well. Twelve years and  running, and still going. Three different publishers have published the  book.  Did you encounter any obstacles when you were writing the book? It   s  one thing to work on a thesis, and it   s another thing to be thinking about  a publication for the general public.  I didn   t think too much about publicizing it until after I got through.  Then I had the stuff, and I knew darn well they were going to take it.  Did Valerie encourage you to publish it, as well?  No, she didn   t. It never came about. It came about after the years  11  Little Thunder  Bieri  Little Thunder  Bieri  Little Thunder  Bieri  because then I was working more directly with children. I was still  working on my master   s. Then after I got in the Cushing system,  particularly in Stillwater   when I got to Stillwater is when I really got  involved with so much good activities for children. You   ll read in some  of my writing the intensity and the fun. I didn   t think too much about  publicizing anything. I concentrated more on trying to develop a good  program, and this program was number one in Oklahoma. Number one  in Oklahoma. That   s when I started getting some awards. People  recognized it and nominated me.  Talk about your job title and some of your responsibilities when you first  got to Stillwater from Cushing.  I was an elementary and physical education teacher and then also  supervisor of physical education. I had five schools of my own that I  went to throughout the week, teaching physical education. At that time,  there was Will Rogers, Highland Park, Westwood, Skyline, Jefferson.  Some of those are not here. Jefferson   s not here. Jefferson school was on  Main Street, and now that   s the Board of Education building. The  superintendent was the superintendent in Cushing for twenty years, and  when he got the job of being superintendent in Stillwater, he called me  up at eleven o   clock at night. He said,    Art, are you ready to go to  Stillwater?    (Laughter) I said,    Yes, sir.    So my wife and I packed up,  and we came on over here.  I was thinking, too, working by rotating schools like that, you   re being  exposed to more games, right? The students are not playing the same  games.  That   s really interesting because they did play the same games because I  needed to see reactions of different students, and it showed. Some  students went the wrong direction on paper, and then when I saw it in  reality, I would explain exactly how they needed to move.  Oh, so as you   re trying out your games, you   re saying it was great to  have those different student bodies.  Yes, and it really worked out well. I recently had an author signing here  in Stillwater at the library. A lady came up to me, and she looked at the  book on games. She said,    How do you know they work?    That was a  great question, you know? I told her,    I experimented for a long time.     But I didn   t copy down notes and everything while I was teaching. That  was a no-no. I kept lesson plans when I was teaching, followed my plans  on through, throughout the year. Then when I got home at night,  everything was clear with me, so I knew how to write.  12  Little Thunder  Bieri  Little Thunder  Bieri  Little Thunder  Bieri  Little Thunder  Bieri  Soon after graduate school, you were appointed to Governor  Henry   Bellmon   s Council on Physical Fitness. How did that appointment come  about?  Okay, Bud Wilkinson was the first executive director for the State of  Oklahoma. Bud Wilkinson was. He was a OU football coach, so he  directed it. Then after he retired, he turned the responsibility to Prentice  Gautt, who was one of the black players on Bud   s team. Prentice Gautt,  good football player and went on to the pros. Prentice and I sat and  talked for a long time about issues. Then Prentice got so involved in the  pros that he couldn   t take care of the responsibilities of the state, so  Governor Bellmon talked to me and appointed me as executive director.  I have that in print, as well.  What were the goals of the Council, and what was its ultimate impact?  We had about twelve to fifteen on the Council. I   ve got a picture of it.  These members were top people in their field, from university level to  K-6. There were people around the state in key areas, Tulsa, Oklahoma  City, Muskogee, Idabel, all over the state, and they were selected by a  chairman of the committee. Everybody agreed to the selection and all,  and we sat around a table, and that was our committee. We all kept in  good contact with one another. We distributed materials. I got a lot of  material on all that. We had Council meetings at the Blue Room.  And the goal was     To improve physical education.  Because, as you said, Oklahoma wasn   t     It had a bad reputation, bad reputation. We had coaches teaching PE, and  PE is not the word. It   s physical education. We had to change  terminologies. We had to make people believe you   re not just throwing a  ball out. You are teaching children skills in jumping and good flexibility.  There are so many things that you had to learn to teach children through  different kinds of activities: rhythm, games, tumbling. We had tumbling,  and trampoline was in at that time, which was sort of part of gymnastics,  but we didn   t get into that category. We only hired physical education  people. That was another thing that we wanted. We wanted to get rid of  the coaching.  In due respect, you don   t need to be coaching and teaching children.  Boy, that was a drawing line. We wrote manuals on that. That   s the way  they say   of all the people I had here in Stillwater that worked under  13  Little Thunder  Bieri  Little Thunder  Bieri  Little Thunder  Bieri  Little Thunder  Bieri  Little Thunder  Bieri  me, (and I worked under the Board of Education and the superintendent)  we met every week to go over problems, conditions, anything. They had  memorandums from me. We always met so everybody does the same  thing. If your child went from Westwood to Will Rogers, you would  have the same program.  That sounds great.  Oh, it was. It was terrific. Then it finally faded out. It faded out.  Stillwater, I   m trying to get back to Stillwater to convince them because  I   m not seeing the same kind of trend.  We   re going to talk about that in a bit. What are your memories of  interactions with Governor Bellmon?  We met only on certain occasions: the time I got the award, the time we  had the Governor   s Council. He had a meeting in Texas on physical  education, and he wanted me to write a proclamation for Oklahoma so  he could take it to Texas. (Laughter) I wrote something just so simple.  I   ve got a copy of it. He used to send me his letterhead. I got copies of  his letterhead. I kept it at school. When I was principal, I kept it at  school, and also when I was a physical education teacher. That was fun.  The postman would come late at night sometimes, give me something  from the governor to follow up on. (Laughter) He was so pleasant all the  time, a graduate from OSU and got the research center here. Always a  lot of respect.  Really behind the program.  Oh, yes, yes he was.  Talk about winning the Oklahoma Fitness Leadership award. How was  that important to you?  I was surprised because I was just doing my job. I knew I had a good  program. I knew the program was taking note around the state, and other  people began to pick it up. I had programs at teachers    meetings in  rhythms. Always had a program on trampoline, which I demonstrated. I  did all my demonstrating.  Oh, you did? You demonstrated everything yourself?  Oh, yes. I demonstrated trampoline skills. I met the author who wrote  the trampoline books, as a matter of fact, right here in Stillwater, and we  had dinner at our house. He gave me some copies of the book. But I did  all my demonstrating in tumbling, swimming, everything, and that  14  Little Thunder  Bieri  Little Thunder  Bieri  Little Thunder  Bieri  Little Thunder  Bieri  Little Thunder  Bieri  helped. That helped because I wasn   t obese, and that was a big help.  I was going to say, in addition to your job, then, are you staying fit,  yourself? You   re doing a certain amount of     I work out twice a week, sometimes three times a week.  But back in the day     Back in the day, I didn   t work out throughout the day at all. I was just  too busy.  You got your fitness     I got my fitness all day long, and I didn   t need it. I had all kinds of  activities that keep me toned. When you talk about being flexible and  strong and all that, I had every bit of it. I still have a lot of it, except that  leg nerve went out.  Well, when you moved up to the position of principal, what was the  difference in your ability to shape practices or policies at the school?  During the time that Dr.  William  Carr was there in Stillwater, he called  me into the office one time and said,    Would you like to be principal of  one of the schools? Let me know Monday morning.    This was on a  Friday.  And he was superintendent?  He was superintendent. Terrific person, just great. He says,    Think about  it,    and I did. My wife and I talked about it and all, and I took the job. I  felt regretful about leaving the children that I worked so hard for. They  did the same thing to me, you see, worked for me. Great parents, great  students, wonderful. So many of them are in business here in town right  now. I catered to those children.  So I got to be principal. I was principal at Lincoln School, and I was  there for about ten years at Lincoln.  I had a fire drill one day and I  checked the rooms, building, to be sure all got out for the drill. I checked  the boys    restroom and there was a second grader on the stool. I said to  him,    Son, we   re having a fire drill and everyone must go out.    The  second grader said,    Mr. Bieri, I   ve got to go so bad. Let it burn, let it  burn. I left the student knowing it was safer for him.  Great school, great  teachers, dedicated children, dedicated teachers. I got a lot of pictures of  my years down there with those people. They finally closed Lincoln and  made it into Lincoln Academy.  15  Little Thunder  Bieri  Little Thunder  Bieri  Little Thunder  Bieri  Little Thunder  Bieri  Little Thunder  Bieri  During that period of time, (you were mentioning how it affected me) I  had a chance when I was principal to change some rules and regulations  because I was in administration. I was able to sell another portion of  what I was trying to do when I couldn   t do it as a teacher. I had the  support of the administration and the staff, the Board of Education, and I  made some good changes.  What were some of those changes?  One of them was to continue having a supervisor of physical education,  and for anything, don   t ever let that program go. It   s still there today.  There is still that position?  Well, not so much that position now, but having a full-time PE teacher at  every elementary school.  In Stillwater it   s still in effect.  In Stillwater. My gosh, there   s so much I   m trying to think.  How about, because you were pretty innovative in terms of fitness and  recreation for mentally challenged or developmentally challenged  children, talk about your work in that area.  Okay, let me retract a little bit. I was nominated in time for this national  award on physical education. I competed against forty-eight people in a  region, and I won out on what my accomplishments were. I got the  chance to go to Washington with ten other people from throughout the  United States. That   s all in print, and that was so terrific. My wife and I  had gone there, spent a couple days in Washington. We did have an  audience scheduled for President Johnson at that time, but he had the  president from India come in, so we were second. We didn   t get to see  him on that.  The mentally retarded, when I was at Lincoln School, I was in charge of  the trainable class. It was called    trainable    at that time. They were  located at Washington Elementary School, which was still usable, but  they were part of Lincoln School. We had a    trainable    teacher at that  time, and I worked with them in swimming at the YMCA.  Did you sort of immediately know that might be a good medium?  No, it was just another one of those things, you know, something to take  a challenge on and see what we could do. There were several of them  16  Little Thunder  Bieri  Little Thunder  Bieri  Little Thunder  Bieri  Little Thunder  that did really, really well, just giving them good exposure. That was at  the YMCA at that time. I wrote a book for the Kennedy Foundation on  swimming for the mentally handicapped. I have copies here. I got  appointed by the Kennedy Foundation to go to Penn State University,  and I did that back in    64 or something of the sort and wrote a book.  Was that to do some research, in a way, about the program?  Well, the Kennedy Foundation was doing extensive work on swimming  for the handicapped, and I   d gone to some conferences and submitted  my goals. I got a letter from Julian Stein, who was in there, appointing  me to be on a committee. So we had gone to Penn State University. I  spent four days there with the other swimming coaches, tremendous,  well-known coaches. We spent four days and brought our materials and  wrote a book that came out as a professional contribution from the  Kennedy Foundation.  What was one of your biggest discoveries about swimming?  Okay, the breathing, when you do rhythmic breathing   in my case,  when I was watching the children and I showed them how to go ahead  and go underwater and blow out your bubbles, I would see that  happening, but then when a child would come on up, they still had that  puffiness in their mouth, and I knew they weren   t doing it.  I got behind them, and they were facing toward the wall, holding onto  the side. I would put my hands on their cheeks of their face, and then I  would help guide them down slowly. Here again, you can touch and get  to feel, and it works. There was never any other kind of a thing. But  when they went under, I told them,    Take a breath of air.    Their cheeks,  their face, was full of air. They went down. I was behind them, took  them on down, slowly. If I knew they weren   t breathing, I   d push in on  their cheek, and then the bubbles start coming on out.  Come to find out, the bubbles before was coming from their bathing suit.  I   ve got a picture in a book on that. I solved a lot of problems on  children in rhythmic breathing, and that was the highlight of one of the  things in the book. The National YMCA wanted me to do one for them,  and I did one for the National YMCA that same year.  Also in  Penn State      Yes, that was also there in Penn State.  What was the status of track and field meets on the elementary-school  level when you started?  17  Bieri  Little Thunder  Bieri  Little Thunder  Bieri  Little Thunder  Bieri  Little Thunder  Bieri  Little Thunder  Bieri  I started a track and field program at Westwood School.  They didn   t have one prior to that?  Oh, no. Nobody did. No one did. No one did in town. They had the high  school, their high school  track  meets at Hamilton Field, but as far as  track in the school system, zero. I started the track program at Westwood  School because I ran a lot of track in high school. I ran the Penn Relays  and a lot of track, and that was in me. I started a track program as part of  an after-school activity. It wasn   t involved in my regular programming.  It was after school. Then we developed on how to run track, how to pass  a baton, how to high jump, broad jump.  We used it on the Westwood School playground, which is still there.  Now they have other facilities on that playground, but it was always  clear. I designed a track to meet that need, and I had some great students.  They were so fast, and everybody was so excited. I ran a track meet on a  given Saturday. Terrific turnout. Then I ran a track meet the following  Saturday at Will Rogers down at Highland Park. I had it throughout the  whole system. The Lions Club picked it up in Stillwater. They helped  sponsor the one at Hamilton Field. They picked it up, and so many of the  kids were in the Lions program on track here in town.  That   s wonderful.  Oh, terrific, yes   When you say you designed the track, you had one built, or you just  adapted that space?  No. Yes, I measured the playground, and then just adapting the space I  had for the kind of activities we did. It wasn   t trying to compete against  any kind of record or anything. We set whatever we set there, you  know?  What a great experience for them.  Oh, it was wonderful, just terrific. That went by the wayside. Another  thing that happened back in those years was that the Board of Education  wanted to cut programs back.  Now we   re talking the   80s, now?  Oh,   60s.  18  Little Thunder  Bieri  Little Thunder  Bieri  Little Thunder  Bieri  Little Thunder  Bieri  Little Thunder  Bieri  Little Thunder  Bieri  Little Thunder  Bieri  Little Thunder  Bieri  Little Thunder  Oh,   60s?  Yes. They wanted to cut programs back, and they did in some part cut  Special Ed back. Kept some, but cut back. It was finances. They didn   t  have a library program at that time at all in the public schools. They did  in junior and senior high, but nothing in elementary, except in the  classroom. You had your little library shelf right there. I   m losing my  thought here only because I   m talking so much.  No, you   re fine   To the cutting back. The Board wanted to cut back. The superintendent  was saying to me and all of us (I was principal back then) we had to cut  back in three areas, give three different plans, and I wouldn   t cut back.  You refused to submit something for cutback purposes.  Finances. They couldn   t support the programs, but they kept PE.   Knocking on wood  They kept PE in every school.  That   s wonderful.  Yes, they never lost it, but the things they lost is, that the people who  was teaching PE are not that good of a teacher because I don   t see them  supervising the activities that   s critical.  These days, you feel like they   re not supervising as closely.  Yes.  Well, in terms of the libraries at the elementary-school level, how did  you get that started?  Now, I have an album right there on the day it started and how it   s still  going on. You really want to look at that album.  It wasn   t just your ideas, I understand.  It was. It was.  It was strictly your idea.  Yes. Now, where the library is today, that was all added. Have you been  to the library in Stillwater?  Yes.  19  Bieri  Little Thunder  Bieri  Little Thunder  Bieri  Little Thunder  Bieri  Little Thunder  Bieri  Little Thunder  Bieri  You know where the auditorium is?  Yes.  Okay, all that, from going up the stairs and all that building, used to be  the old high school. Then they converted it into   when they built the  new high school where it is, they converted that into an elementary  school. It was called South High. During those early years in the   60s,  Stillwater went into a building transition, and they took all the potential  sixth graders for the next year to go down to South High where the  library auditorium is. That was all elementary. I taught there, all the  sixth graders in town, for one year, besides having my other job up there  at Westwood, which had K-5.  So you were teaching phys ed there?  Yes, strictly physical education. Then when I got to be principal at  Lincoln School   I don   t want to make it too confusing because the  timing was so in there, you know. When I got to be principal of Lincoln,  they had a foyer before you went into the auditorium, and I had an office  in that foyer area, my PE office, because I was doing principal shift and  PE at the same time. The Board wanted me to do two and not hire.  That   s a lot.  Yes, I dressed up in the morning to do my principal work and came back  in the afternoon and had PE. (Laughs) Every day for a whole year. When  I was principal, I sat in the foyer in the different corners. School was out  and everything else. I said,    You know, this could be used.    So I  proposed to the teachers in a teacher   s meeting,    You have all these  books in here, and I   d like to start a library down there in the foyer.    I  said,    I   ll get the shelves. We   ll get the place painted, everything else, if  you would go ahead and take what books you want out of your library in  the classroom and start the library.    And we did.  So contribute to the shared library from your respective classrooms.  Right, from K-5 at that time. Great  What excitement. I called up  Dr.   Bernie Belden and another reading teacher at the college, whom I knew.  They sent me college students to come down. There   s pictures in that.  To serve as librarians, sort of?  They shelved books. They put the books on the shelves and all. I had the  teachers give me their  sixth  grade students to work in the library.  20  Little Thunder  Bieri  Little Thunder  Bieri  Little Thunder  Bieri  Little Thunder  Bieri  Little Thunder  Bieri  Little Thunder  Bieri  What a great idea.  It was great, and they just jumped at it, you know? I taught them as  much as I knew about library. I took library science and stuff in college,  and children   s literature and all like that. The library got started by  teachers from their classrooms. I had the sixth grade students on time  schedules to work in the library. We had a little desk area and  everything. We had books that were provided by the PTA. We screened  all these books; had a committee to do all that. We had all kinds of crap  and all kinds of good stuff, and we shoved that thing up. Donations from  civil clubs, all kinds of nice things. So I took my office that I had in PE,  took that out and made it into an audio sound room. The picture   s in  there, too.  So that initial effort just really brought in more and more donations of  books.  That   s true. The next step I took from that point is that I had a book fair  at Lincoln School. That   s where the original book fairs in Stillwater  schools started.  Which is a popular event.  Oh, my gosh, and still, today. That   s in that thing, too. I had that on  display last year at the Library Month.  Did you work on the book fair by yourself, or did you have help?  Calvin McIntyre was the principal at Skyline. He helped me. He and I  were very good friends. Mike Hopkins from the university, (he  homeschooled his children) he was excited. The thrust was that since we  had a book fair going on at Lincoln, people from town, these other  schools came down to the book fair. There were some beautiful books. I  went down to the  Oklahoma  Reading Association in Oklahoma City  and got carts and carts of books, put them in my truck, and went down  there week after week for a whole year, easy.  Now, the books at the book fair are for sale     Yes.     and it   s raising money for the library system?  Right, in our school. So the PTAs were getting really antsy. They said,     Why can   t we do this?    I said,    You can.    So I went to Westwood the  21  Little Thunder  Bieri  Little Thunder  Bieri  Little Thunder  Bieri  Little Thunder  Bieri  Little Thunder  Bieri  Little Thunder  Bieri  Little Thunder  next time, and right on through the system.  You moved the book fair to different schools.  Yes, I sure did, right. We kept the prices low to where people can buy  those books, and we also gave free books out. It hit like wildfire. Roscoe  Rouse, who was at the Edmon Low Library, he was the director for  many, many years. He and I talked. He had political influence in the  state, and I proposed this kind of program. I said,    Listen, Roscoe, we  can go ahead and try to get the Board shook up with this thing. The  PTA   s got the Board going.    Soon after, a bond issue came about with  the libraries on them. (Laughs) That   s how all these libraries are in  Stillwater, from that.  To create libraries from a bond issue that came about partly as a result  of that enthusiasm.  And that bond issue put libraries in every elementary school. When they  built onto an elementary school, they put a library in there, and they also  put a gymnasium in there. A gymnasium  They all got gyms. All this  new construction, Highland Park and Will Rogers, all have gyms. I  taught in the lunch room every day.  What a difference. What a great accomplishment.  Oh, what a nice thing. It   s still going on today. Every school has got a  library and full-time librarians, no coaches, nothing like that, and teacher  aides. That   s another program that they never threw away. They will  never do it. They built on, you see. They built the Stillwater Library onto  the grade school, South Elementary.  Oh, the bond issue, you   re saying for the public library.  For the Stillwater Public Library, plus every elementary school.  They were part and parcel of the same bond issue.  Isn   t that great?  That   s wonderful, yes.  Oh, my gosh, and it   s all there. I   ve got the album right there, and  you   ve got to look at it and read it because it gives you chills. If you get  a chance, you can look at the cartoons and all.  Yes, it   s just amazing, the ripple effect that this library program had and  22  Bieri  Little Thunder  Bieri  Little Thunder  Bieri  the excitement it created.  Oh, you can go to any library in town, and I do, and I   m just awed by it.  There   s other problems that took place that I   m not too happy with.  One of the things I wanted to ask you is, you were clearly aware in your  job as principal of the different ways in which poor children often have  operated at a disadvantage in school, and I   m wondering what  differences you   ve noticed over the years, from the   60s until the time  you retired. Were there differences in the degree of disadvantage? Has it  lessened? Have we gotten better about getting them the help they need?  Yes, I think there   s been improvements. I   ll try to break it down  somewhat. Lincoln School had a lot of people come from that school in  past years that have been successful in life. Winfrey Houston, who   s a  well-known lawyer in town, wonderful person, had attended Lincoln  School. He   s been a lawyer for many years. Great family, great person.  He, only one of many.  There   s so many students that followed up in their dads    professions of  auto mechanics and other professions, plumbing, that   s notable. There   s  a lot of them that   s had a tough life. Lincoln School, through the years,  has been one of poverty, degradation, but yet they had a good attitude  that,    We   re doing the best we can, and we do accept support, but we  have our pride.    We had to always be careful a lot of times not to  degrade the children in any way. That   s why the staff at Lincoln was so,  so good. The attitude came because we all felt the same need, that we do  what we can with the children.  We had good parents, parents that did the best they could. We had a  good terrific lunchroom staff and wonderful food. Ironically, one of my  head cooks that was at Lincoln when I was there   and then they phased  out Lincoln School and made it to be Lincoln Academy. The year we  were phasing out, I talked to the lunchroom manager there, Florence  Presley, wonderful lady, very dedicated, good family, if she would like  to go with me to Highland Park and be my secretary up there. The  reason I say Highland Park is because the Board of Education asked me  that particular year in the   70s to take Highland Park School and still  have Lincoln.  You were to be principal at both?  Yes, I was. I was principal at Lincoln, and the Board asked me about  taking Highland Park. I said,    Do I have a choice?    They said no.  (Laughter) Jim Sanders was the assistant superintendent. We talked  gracefully. So I had Lincoln, did the morning principal shift, and then  23  Little Thunder  Bieri  Little Thunder  Bieri  Little Thunder  Bieri  Little Thunder  Bieri  Little Thunder  Bieri  Little Thunder  Bieri  Little Thunder  PE, then went to Highland Park. I did that all year long. It took my  marriage, too, just about. (Laughs)  They got a lot of hours from you.  They got a lot out of me. I   ll tell you that. (Laughter) Oh, my goodness  sakes. So Florence took a typing class, was the head cook, and she was  my secretary for twenty years. Isn   t that great?  Highland Park. That is.  Wonderful person.  I saw that you got into some cooking, yourself, after you retired, and you  even worked at a couple of restaurants. What   s your background in  cooking?  Well, I got interested because my mother was always a good cook. She  was a dietician at Monmouth College back in the years. She was a  wonderful cook, and it just rubbed on me. When I got married, I still  continued on cooking at the house and all and made the dinners. Of  course, my wife helped me out and all like that, but basically trying to  put out the dinner.  So you both shared the cooking.  Oh, yes, we shared it quite a bit and then put the emphasis on  Thanksgiving and the holidays. We also belonged to a dinner group for a  long time, which was very nice.  Where you cooked for each other.  Yes, at the different homes.  Right.  One was the hostess, you know, and everybody contributed. That was  always a lot of fun. I was the Chef of the Week in Stillwater. I got a  picture of it, Chef of the Week. The photographer came and interviewed  me and took a picture and all. I took some classes in culinary arts at the  university, Food and Wine for example. We could not drink, and the  professor always told us,    You don   t drink on campus,    and that was it  at the time. It was a great class, learned an awful lot, but, you know, if  you don   t stay with it, you lose it.  Well, you did  I see you worked as a prep chef. It   s one thing to cook at  24  Bieri  Little Thunder  Bieri  Little Thunder  Bieri  Little Thunder  Bieri  Little Thunder  Bieri  Little Thunder  Bieri  Little Thunder  Bieri  Little Thunder  home, but then you actually worked as a prep chef.  Yes, I did at Traditions Restaurant. Where Charlie   s Chicken is, that  used to be Traditions. That was another restaurant. I worked for the  family. I made some of the potato salad and some of the selections that  was on the buffet.  Some of the side dishes.  And I catered in Stillwater from my house for twelve years.  Oh, I didn   t know that.  Yes, I catered twelve years.  What did you call your company?  I didn   t. I really didn   t really have a name. It was just my name. I  cooked for the women   s clinic. I cooked for some churches. I cooked for  the women   s church group in Highland Park. One year, I made twenty  salads. Twenty salads. It was during the wintertime, so I was able to  keep it fresh, and I laid it all out. It   s amazing. I can see it, but, boy, the  preparation, I studied so much. I made different kinds of salads. Herring  salad and all, liver salad, oh, my gosh, sakes. I laid that whole thing out  at Highland Park Church for the women   s group.  That   s really amazing. You wrote a children   s book called A Squirrel   s  Dilemma that recently went through its third printing. Its premise is a  squirrel who loses its home, and, therefore, its source of food. I read you  were inspired to write it because the trees in a nearby park were being  cut.  Right.  Do you think of your book as a kind of environmental book?  I really do. I don   t think that people really read the book. I always tell  them when I sign a book or give them a copy to read the preface. Read  the preface and catch that bottom line.  Which is? Why don   t you read it to us real quick.  It took me two years to write this. I took a lot of notes because I pass the  area around a lot of times. Do you want me to read the whole thing?  Well, why don   t you read that bottom line that was so important?  25  Bieri  Little Thunder  Bieri  Little Thunder  Bieri  Little Thunder  Bieri  This is about the book.    A general theme is that when something  happens, decisions must be made and adjustments narrowed, and the  best choice made with comfort.    These squirrels went through a lot.  (Laughs) I kept my notes all the time I was over in Tulsa working for   peanuts  in college. After they cleaned that whole area out and  everything, there was one squirrel that was left. Just ironically, he was  sitting on a tree stump.  That is ironic. So you have a drawing of him that you did.  Yes. There was a picture that just met the situation. He was on a tree  stump and gnawing on a nut. He lost it all, you see? So that had a lot of  impression     So you saw it as a metaphor for     Well, not destroying the habitat of things. All his food stuff was right  there, his playground was right there, friends, foes, you know. It was all  there. You can see it even around town, here. Places where squirrels are  having a good time or whatever, and yet the bulldozer comes by and  tears it on down.  So another part of the book that I got thinking about, I dedicate this book  to my family and to all the squirrels in heaven who didn   t make it across  the street. (Laughter) You see that all the time, you know? Either the  driver wasn   t concerned or anything, or it was a good target, or  whatever.  Right. We all know about some of the disadvantages of getting older, but  what are some of the perks? What   s rewarding about this phase of your  life?  The thing of it is, I don   t look at my age as being older. My mental and  physical is sharp. Psychologically, if you have a birthday, subtract one,  and that works. That works. If you don   t have health problems or  physical problems of any kind, you   re going to make it through. You  should. Keep a good life and everything. Toast yourself once in a while.  Be a good citizen. Be around good people. Have a good family, a lot of  support, a lot of friends. Age-wise, as long as I stay mentally and  physically, you should be able to do well.  I see so many people that have given up on themselves. I don   t have to  ask them. I can just tell, you know? What I do now, I   m just getting  started is the way I look at it. Any time you can help somebody to feel  better and do good, and really make accomplishments, something that  26  Little Thunder  Bieri  Little Thunder  Bieri  Little Thunder  Bieri  wasn   t there before you got there   that was one of my intents years and  years ago.    I   m going to make this program work, something better than  what they had.    They didn   t have anything.  Senator Robert Murphy, Bob Murphy and family, Peggy Murphy, great  people, he was senator in Oklahoma for a long time. He got Highway  177 built. Highway 51, he had that all four-laned. Great senator. He had  children at Westwood School. I talked to him about having a  gymnasium. He said,    Well, how about having some Quonset huts put  on the playgrounds and use that?    He and I played tennis together. I  said,    Senator, if we ever have that, we   ll never get a gym.    Look what  happened. There   s gyms in every place.  You held out for what you wanted.  Held out, and people helped support me. I taught PE, physical education,  in the lunchrooms of every school, and on the playground, and it paid  off. It did so because people began to believe and see good results in  their kids. We had good attitudes; we had good parents. We had some  problems, but you tried to work them out better than using a paddle.  That doesn   t do it. Coaches teaching subjects, that doesn   t do it. You  need to stay in that field and get with it.  Well, I think those are really good words to end on. Is there anything  else you want to say before we     Well, I thank the university, and, of course, I thank my parents and my  children and all. My wife and everybody gave me a lot of support. Like I  said, I   m not through yet. I have better things to help out and everything  because the university   s really helped a great deal, and I had great  professors.  People criticize their teachers and all like that, but you better look back  and think you   re going to learn something, and hopefully you put it to  good use. So many of these professors have retired. I see them. Some of  them moved out of town. You lose track. It is unfortunate, you know?  Thank you very much for your time today, Art.  Thank you, Julie. I enjoyed it very much.  -------  -------
