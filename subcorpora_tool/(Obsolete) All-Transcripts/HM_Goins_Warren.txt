Story_ID: 632101
Speaker 1: I want to first start out by asking about your parents and if you could first talk about your father [Jepther Goins] and what you know of his background.  I'm interested in the name, Goins, too, if you know any--
Speaker 2: It was, my dad was born in 1913.  He was born in Winston-Salem [North Carolina].  He was very, his family background is very cloudy.  We were able to get some birth certificates when he applied for a job in the postal system [U.S. Post Office Department; U.S. Postal Service] and they came from Winston-Salem, and he was, gave his mother's [Grace Goins] age as being born in 1959, 1859, and his father's [Major Goins] age.  So both of them seemed inaccurate because my dad claimed to be born in 1913, so the ages didn't correspond and all I know, he never really talked about his family.  He came to New York [New York] with his sister [Carrie Goins], an older sister, and he was thirteen or fourteen, and he lived in Harlem [New York, New York] initially, and was, I guess his older sister went off to work and he was about fourteen or fifteen.  He was staying with some uncles in Brooklyn [New York] and a family in Brooklyn took him in, I guess his uncles were not that dependable, and he always considered them his family and they were a family that lived on Monroe Street, a lot of uncles, and I'm still in contact with them.  They were Gaetano [ph.], and I always referred to them as--
Speaker 1: Did you say--
Speaker 2: Gaetano--
Speaker 1: Gaetano.  It's the last name?
Speaker 2: It's the last name.
Speaker 1: I see.  So they were Italian?
Speaker 2: No.  They were from Venezuela, I think.  But they associated with blacks and phenotypically they were black, and they took him in as a young man and he always considered that his family and I grew up going to Thanksgiving, Christmas holidays with this group and it was a large family already, but they were--
Speaker 1: But they took him in.
Speaker 2: They took him in.
Speaker 1: So really, his sister, what about the continued relationship (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) His sister, as years went by, we did see her and she worked, was basically a housekeeper for a rich family in Connecticut, and that's, I don't know too much more than that, and I did meet some of his supposedly uncles or distant--but I was young and we would go up to, they lived in the Bronx [New York] but he didn't, they didn't have much influence on me or our family.
Speaker 1: So, he really grew up by himself--
Speaker 2: Basically, basically (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) In some respect.
Story_ID: 632102
Speaker 1: So you don't really know where the name comes from or do (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, I was at a cocktail party about two years ago, maybe, maybe three, and this girl, lady I was talking to, I knew she was a dentist here in New York [New York] and she said, "Oh, Goins is in all the books, just Google Goins.  You'll get all the information you want."  And, I had never really, I knew there were Goins from Detroit [Michigan], there were some Goins down south, but I had no contact with them.  Anyway, when I Googled the name, there were pages and pages and pages of Goins; of Indians [Native American], whites, and blacks.  So, I wasn't really definitive in terms of localizing where he came, but hit that area of the country, the name was apparently very popular at one time, and they had pictures and everything else in the, and I think they called them Melungeons or something to that effect.
Speaker 1: Melungeons?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: I have something that I can show you.
Speaker 1: That's sort of interesting.  The other thing is that I've learned of recent because my mother was adopted and her family is from North Carolina--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and there's a lot of genealogical--North Carolina State has the best genealogical records as relates to black people (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's interesting.
Speaker 1: So just--
Speaker 2: Well, he [Goins' father, Jepther Goins] had a birth certificate, which was have, we were able to get but it, it just didn't seem like it was accurate with the ages of his, supposedly his parents [Grace Goins and Major Goins].  They would have been too old, I think, to have a child.
Speaker 1: Right, right.  So, but on the birth certificate, it had the old ages?
Speaker 2: Yes, it had a date.
Speaker 1: Oh, so the dates he gave you were on the birth certificate?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: That's odd, okay.
Speaker 2: That's what he had to use to apply for the federal job [with the U.S. Post Office Department; U.S. Postal Service], because he didn't have a real birth certificate.  When we tried to get it, that's what was sent up.
Speaker 1: So, he never really spoke about his growing up then.
Speaker 2: No, he never really, never said anything definitive.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He, sometimes he would say he was part Indian or something like that.  We weren't interested in that in those days. We nev- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, maybe the Melungeons--
Speaker 2: Melungeons.  But so, we really didn't know.
Speaker 1: Oh, you were discounting him.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: Bring my, bring my father back, okay.
Story_ID: 632103
Speaker 1: So, what about your mother, what about her?
Speaker 2: Well, my mother's family was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Her name first.
Speaker 2: Ernestine Lucretia Goins [Ernestine Matthews Goins].  Her maiden name was Matthews, and she was able to trace, she didn't do it herself but traced all the way back basically to Ireland.  There was a fellow by the name of Shaw [ph.] and some Indian [Native American] woman, and they had a daughter, Fields [ph.], and then Fields went to--the next generation was my great-grandmother [Ellen Morton] after Fields, and we have someone in the family from New Jersey documented that traced it all the way back, so that, that we have.
Speaker 1: So where, your mother is originally from New York [New York], right?
Speaker 2: Yes, she was born in New York.  My grandmother [Nancy Morton Matthews] was born in New York.
Speaker 1: Oh, so you, so a lot of generations going back--
Speaker 2: Yeah, and my great-grandmother was born in Virginia and moved to New York when I knew her, my great-grandmother.
Speaker 1: Oh, you did know her (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: So, when was she, was she born around slavery?
Speaker 2: I think right after slavery.
Speaker 1: Right after slavery, okay.  And so, what did your mother, what did she talk about with her growing up?
Speaker 2: My mother didn't, my mother had four, three sisters and a brother, and she'd talk about, as far as to me, nothing specific.  She was a housewife, a great mother, very warm, not, was involved with family, didn't join any clubs or anything like that.  She was predominantly involved with her family and her sisters and things like that.
Speaker 1: So your parents didn't really talk a lot about their backgrounds or--
Speaker 2: My mother, very--my father [Jepther Goins], no, and my mother, you know, everything was sort of, they weren't sure what was going on and there was, it was just a, we didn't really talk about it too much.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, how many kids in your family?
Speaker 2: I have a sister [Nancy Matthews].
Speaker 1: Okay.  And her age?
Speaker 2: She is seventy-one.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So she's four years younger than you (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 632104
Speaker 1: Tell me about your earliest memory of growing up.
Speaker 2: Well, I can look out the window and see where I grew up in Long Island City, in Queens [New York].  It was, I went to public school [P.S. 83] in Queens.  And I lived in the projects right under the Queensboro Bridge or Koch--they call it now--Bridge [Ed Koch Queensboro Bridge], right there in Queens, and--
Speaker 1: What were the name of the projects?
Speaker 2: Queensbridge [Queensbridge Houses, Queens, New York].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Queensbridge.
Speaker 2: And this area where we look out now, we see these, Long Island City has been built up quite a bit with condos and what not.  That was all just factories, horse stables, and farms when I was a little boy.
Speaker 1: So, how did your parents [Ernestine Matthews Goins and Jepther Goins], so do you know how your parents met?
Speaker 2: Yes.  They met from this family that my father was living with, they used to play ball and my mother's brother [Alphonso Matthews, Jr.], my mother had an older brother who was a good friend of my dad's and that's how they basically met.  She met him through her older brother.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: Okay.  So your--so you grew up--your parents met--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Do you know how old they were when they met?
Speaker 1: I think they were, I guess late teenage years.
Speaker 2: And your father, your mother was, she was young, wait.
Speaker 1: No, she was a year younger than my dad.
Speaker 2: A year younger, okay, I was trying to look at the, oh, I'm looking at the wrong things, I'm looking at the--that's there, yeah, okay, that's right, okay.  So, tell me about, so, for a while you are the only child for four years.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Okay.  But do you remember your earliest memory?  You said--
Speaker 1: I remember going to school, Mom making me wear a shirt and tie every day.
Speaker 2: Do you remember younger than that?
Speaker 1: When I say going to school, I'm talking about early grades.  I can remember being in public school, sixth or seventh grade, but nothing, nothing stands out, particularly.
Story_ID: 632105
Speaker 1: When you are, tell me where you, I know where you were living, but can you describe the block that you grew up on?
Speaker 2: Well, I, the Queensbridge projects [Queensbridge Houses, Queens, New York] was one of the earliest public housing in the City of New York [New York] and the surrounding area was basically sandstone woods, an Italian area and the, we were one of a few black families in the projects in those days.  And the, and I just remember it as a pleasant time, you know, because everywhere you had these buildings so you had plenty of kids your age in the building, and we used to play ball and it was pleasant.  I have no negative feelings.
Speaker 1: So how many stories high were--
Speaker 2: Six.
Speaker 1: Six stories, okay.
Speaker 2: Six stories.
Speaker 1: And were you on the--
Speaker 2: We were on the second floor.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So you didn't have to climb up--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --a lot of stairs.
Speaker 2: And there were elevators.
Speaker 1: And do you, can you describe family life in your, you know--
Speaker 2: With my immediate family?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: It was, I and my parents, I thought, got along very well.  My dad [Jepther Goins] was a hard worker.  He had two full time jobs and a part time job.
Speaker 1: And what were the two full time?
Speaker 2: Well, he worked for the federal government [for the U.S. Post Office Department; U.S. Postal Service].  He was a window cleaner in the post office and he had worked for a private company in Brooklyn [New York] as a window cleaner also, and he had a waxing machine where he used to wax some people's offices, you know, with scraping the floor and then polishing.  So, he was a very hard worker and my mom [Ernestine Matthews Goins] was a housewife and, as far as I know, they got along very, very well.
Speaker 1: So, when your father, what time would he leave to go to work?
Speaker 2: He would leave early because he worked, well he would leave early in the morning around, I guess, six or seven, but I always remember we usually ate dinner around five o'clock and then sometimes he'd go to work after that.
Speaker 1: And so, oh, so he, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, 'cause he had two full time jobs.
Speaker 1: So he had two full time jobs.  So, your mother was really the main caregiver in that way, which was typical, so what, so what would be a daily routine?
Speaker 2: For her?
Speaker 1: For her, for you.
Speaker 2: Oh.  Well, I'd go to school.  You know, I would be home, I guess by 3:30, and we would, I'd play ball.  I was very active in a lot of sports.
Speaker 1: What was your favorite sport?
Speaker 2: I used to play basketball at one time and, but, you know, well when I got to high school [Stuyvesant High School, New York, New York] I used to swim, run track, and play basketball, so.
Speaker 1: Oh, so you were very athletic.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 632106
Speaker 1: So can you share any holidays, 'cause it sounds like, now on your mother's [Ernestine Matthews Goins] side were there rel- did she have a lot of relatives or--
Speaker 2: Yes.  The holidays when my great-grandmother was alive and I didn't appreciate it at the time, of course. She had about six or seven children, and they each had--and then we all used to go to her house and she would, you know, they would have all sorts of foods around, I remember cream onion and things like that, that I didn't particularly like but I can remember, and they were (unclear) but usually on Christmas we would go there and I would be a, you know, I was young at the time.  You know, you get a few Christmas presents, you'd wanna stay home with the Christmas, 'cause we were in Queens [New York] and we were dragged off to Brooklyn [New York] and for these family gatherings and I didn't know most of the family because I didn't see them, and a lot of my grandmother's [Nancy Morton Matthews] sisters lived within three or four blocks of each other and my great-grandmother lived right, everybody lived, so they spent a lot of time socializing and what not and I do remember that, and I can remember staying at my great-grandmother's house.  There was a stable and cobblestones and they had trollies all over Brooklyn in those days, but, and I know my mom missed that sort of thing, because she was in Queens, which sort of isolated her from the group, and as she got older she always felt well, you know, I could always, she could always walk around to her sister's house or something, years back, and so she used to reminisce about the old time, more than I did (laughter).
Speaker 1: Because she really, you were the odd people out.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: She wasn't part of the group (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The group.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and everything.  So, you had more of a nuclear family then, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: In that way.
Speaker 2: Way, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 632107
Speaker 1: So, what was your mother [Ernestine Matthews Goins], how would you describe her though?  I know you've said that--
Speaker 2: My mom was, as I said, talkative among her friends.  She wasn't very outgoing.  She was, I think, a little shy but not shy with dealing with me or in expressing an opinion but with everybody, you know, she didn't do too much and, as I said, she was very dependent on my father [Jepther Goins] to take her places in terms of she didn't like travelling by herself.  That was essentially, essentially it.  And she was basically a housewife who devoted most of her time to her kids, children.
Speaker 1: Now what do you have of each parent?  What do you have of each of them?
Speaker 2: Well, I think people would have considered me a hard worker.  I spent, did most of my job, even as a physician we worked very hard.  One time there I had two children [Hilary Van Kleeck and Jeffrey Goins] in private school and a wife [HistoryMaker Charlynn Goins] in law school [Columbia Law School, New York, New York], and in those days it was easier to work different jobs as a physician and so, and I think my dad, as I said, was a very hard worker and as far as my mom goes, she seemed to be very comfortable in her own skin without being involved with a lot of other people other than the family, and to some degree I tend to be that way too.
Story_ID: 632108
Speaker 1: I want to take you back to, you know, a young boy living there.  Now, you lived there until what age, in the, in the projects?
Speaker 2: 'Til about when I was seventeen, my parents [Ernestine Matthews Goins and Jepther Goins] moved.
Speaker 1: To White Plains [New York].
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: My parents moved to, back to Brooklyn [New York].
Speaker 1: Oh, they moved--oh, so you went from, okay.
Speaker 2: I went from--yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So now, what are you, what sights, smells, and sounds remind you of growing up?
Speaker 2: I did mention the stable, the horses, and there was a big fire, tragic.  They used to, I guess, keep the horses there, go maybe to the Belmont racetrack [Belmont Park, Elmont, New York] or something like that and there was a big fire one time, and I can remember that smell but no particular--and there were trees; fortunately there were a number of trees around but no specific smells.  The sound, as I mentioned I lived at Queensbridge [Queensbridge Houses, Queens, New York] and our house was adjacent to the bridge [Ed Koch Queensboro Bridge] and in those days, trollies ran across the bridge and I could hear the trolley.  It got to the point where I didn't even recognize it but I did know when my friends came by they would jump when they heard the trolley, the noise going across the bridge.  And sights, we lived next to the East River, on the other side, and there was a nice park right across the street, but, you know, we used to ride the bike and play ball in the park.
Story_ID: 632109
Speaker 1: So, how would you describe yourself as a young person?  (Cough) What were you like?
Speaker 2: I used to play ball in school.  I was always, did okay in school.  I had a lot of friends.  We had enough people my age and things, we had teams and I think one of the biggest, I went to the local school for, I guess 'til eighth grade [at P.S. 83, Queens, New York] and then I took, they had these exams and I went to a special high school in New York [New York] in Manhattan.  I used to take the train.  That's when the train was a nickel.  I would get on the train and ride to school.  I went to Stuyvesant [Stuyvesant High School, New York, New York] and there I was in a homeroom class with a fellow by the name of Eric Bannister and he, we were in the same homeroom class and he was a black fellow from Brooklyn [New York], who, you know, we were, I knew him for four years.  In fact, he was, we had mentioned--just to diverge a little bit, he was going to visit Isabel Stewart [Isabel Carter Stewart], and died in a plane crash.  This was, she was at Nantucket [Massachusetts] and that was, that's when we were in, he had already accepted to Columbia Law School [New York, New York].  I'm a little choked up now (crying).
Speaker 1: You were close to him, you were close to him.
Speaker 2: But anyway, we, at the school I played basketball.
Speaker 1: What, so you knew him in school, at Stuyvesant.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  That's where I met him.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: And another fellow, Stuart Taylor, who was a year ahead of us and both of their fathers were physicians in Brooklyn and I was friendly with them--
Story_ID: 632110
Speaker 1: So let me, so you were always good with science and math, or did you--
Speaker 2: I got, I got by.  I did, in Stuyvesant [Stuyvesant High School, New York, New York], I--
Speaker 1: But wait, before we get to Stuyvesant, can we go back to where you went to elementary school, yes.  Where'd you go?
Speaker 2: P.S. 83.
Speaker 1: And that's in--Queens [New York].
Speaker 2: Queens.  That's right.  P.S. 83.
Speaker 1: And then now, during that time, did you like school, were you a good student, was there--
Speaker 2: I was always a good student.  You know, at those days they had the one, two, three, four class where they graded the students and I was always in the one class and then in seventh grade or so, or eighth grade, I think it was, they put me in the two class and they--
Speaker 1: So this was tracking.
Speaker 2: Tracking, yes.  They were tracking students.  And my, when it came to take the tests for the special schools in New York [New York], my mother [Ernestine Matthews Goins] went up; because I was in a two class they didn't want me to take the test and my mother went up and complained and they allowed me to take the test after she was up there complaining and that's how I got into Stuyvesant.
Speaker 1: I see, because you had to test into Stuyvesant, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And it's a very good school but it's good for science, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, science and math.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Science and math.  So, at this point in time I'm just trying to get a sense of you as a person, what your interests are, you know, I know you talked about sports in high school but, I mean but before that what are you, what sort of, what are you dreaming thinking about, what--
Speaker 2: Well, I always wanted to be a physician.
Speaker 1: Now, where did that come from?
Speaker 2: Well, there, one of my father's [Jepther Goins] friends, the doctor, my private physician, a fellow by the name of Dr. Aurelius King.  He was an old doctor in Brooklyn [New York], a friend of my dad's, and he, I used to see him as a patient and he said, "Well, you know when you get ready to go to college let me know."  And, he sort of convinced me to go to Lincoln [Lincoln University, Lincoln University, Pennsylvania], and he was a big fan of mine, I guess that's the only way to put it.  And so, he, so that was very good.  When I went to Lincoln, I had a scholarship and the thing that went with it, and when I did go to Lincoln, though, this was in '50 [1950], '51 [1951], a few of my friends were going to the Ivy League schools and I was, there were one or two blacks out of a thousand in the Ivy League schools in the early '50s [1950s]. So, even the basketball coach, I remember telling me go to, he said, "Go to Lincoln.  They won't let you fall through the cracks."  So, you know, I went there and that was it.  And Stuyvesant, I think, had a big effect on me in terms of, you know, the teacher would say not to me personally but would say to the class, "Oh, you boys are lucky.  You should be able to do anything you want in this world in terms of profession," and that gives us a sense of positive, that you can do and it makes you, I think gives kids a, a feeling that they can do things and, you know, without doubting or whether you make the grade, so I think, I think it was very positive.
Story_ID: 632111
Speaker 1: He was, Dr. King, Aurelius King, was an old friend of my mother [Ernestine Matthews Goins] and father [Jepther Goins], I would guess, and he was an impressionable guy--
Speaker 2: And what was his personality like?
Speaker 1: Very outgoing.  Very outgoing, big talker and he was very good.  In fact, he even, he gave me a loan after I was out of medical school [Howard University College of Medicine, Washington, D.C.] to get our house in New Rochelle [New York], so he really helped us.
Speaker 2: So he believed in you from a little tyke.
Speaker 1: Oh, yes.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now, I want to ask about growing up with your sister [Nancy Matthews].  So, she comes.  You've been used to being an only child and then you've got a little girl there, so how close or not close were you?
Speaker 1: I don't think we were that close.  But very close now, I mean, for the last--as kids, those four years were a big four years.
Speaker 2: Yeah, because you're four years older and she, you know--
Speaker 1: So, but, there was no sibling rivalry or anything like that, that I was aware of.
Speaker 2: Now are there expectations of you as the oldest son or the boy in the family?
Speaker 1: My parents, my father never made any comments about my grades and my mother said, "Why don't you do a little better," occasionally.  But I was, they didn't make a big effort, but they were very proud and pleased that I was in school and doing reasonably well.
Story_ID: 632112
Speaker 1: And so, were your, the other kids that were your friends, were they also doing well in school and?
Speaker 2: Well, I dropped sort of out of the local neighborhood boys when I went to Stuyvesant [Stuyvesant High School, New York, New York].
Speaker 1: That's right, okay, so when (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It was a half an hour ride on the trains, you know, because I had to, I think I had to take one or two trains at the time to school.
Speaker 1: Now, do you remember the day that you got the announcement that you were going, or was it a letter that you got that--
Speaker 2: I think it was a letter.  I was very pleased and there were two or three other people from the same school that also got the letter and went to Stuyvesant also from a public school that I was at [P.S. 83, Queens, New York].
Speaker 1: So, what was the experience when you got there?  Did you find that it was harder than the school that you had been in previously?
Speaker 2: Well, I was in eighth grade going into ninth grade, so it was the next year.
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: And at the time, went for four years and--
Speaker 1: Oh, so Stuyvesant began in the ninth grade.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Some kids went in the tenth, but I went in the ninth, and the, what they had at that time, there were about eight hundred students in my class and they had a split session, and out of the eight hundred, there were about eight or nine black kids, and I would say the rest were predominantly Jewish.  There may have been an Asian kid or Spanish, but predominantly the eight blacks and that was the ratio.  This is '51 [1951].  This past April in The New York Times, they mentioned Stuyvesant again and there was something like--don't hold me to these figures--but out of the eight hundred there were eight blacks.  There were about seventeen Spanish, they said 171 whites and the rest were Asian.  That's the statistics in the school now. So fifty years later blacks have made no progress in that particular school, and it's really tragic when you look at it that way, but that's the situation.  And, you know, it was a free school and you, but anyway, I was very pleased; pleased to be there and it made a big difference.  When I got to college [Lincoln University, Lincoln University, Pennsylvania], I didn't have any trouble.
Speaker 1: Right because the trade-in was very good with math and science.
Speaker 2: And the, you know, and I got accepted to medical school [Howard University College of Medicine, Washington, D.C.] early and, so I was, you know, very fortunate.
Story_ID: 632113
Speaker 1: So, when you are, you know, at that point in time when you're in high school [Stuyvesant High School, New York, New York], you're becom- you're aware of the world around you.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So, what are the things that are happening that are, you're aware whether it's in sports and, you know, you're, you have a sports hero that you have or your own personal interests or, I'm just trying to sort of get a sense of who you're becoming.
Speaker 2: Well, I was involved in sports.  My, the school was split in two sessions, so the upper grades went from 8:30 to 12:30, and I think you took five courses or something like that, and the afternoon was the lower grade, just the juniors and seniors, and I can't particularly pick out any, you know, sports heroes like Jackie Robinson or anything like that.  I guess the focus, we had a group of fellows this time that used to get together and have parties, fourteen, fifteen, and--
Speaker 1: You would have parties at fourteen, fifteen years of age?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  In fact, this fellow Stuart, Stuart Taylor, who was a year ahead of me in high school, he, we went to, I used to go, he would have parties and I would go from Queens [New York] to Brooklyn [New York] to see the parties and that was my first exposure to large numbers of black people, and so we, yeah fourteen, fifteen.  Then I went off to college at seventeen.
Speaker 1: But no, so you were young too.  Okay, so, now when you say parties are these coed parties or are these--
Speaker 2: Coed parties, you know.
Speaker 1: At parents' homes.
Speaker 2: At parents' homes.
Speaker 1: Okay, and that's how you got to meet each other and everything.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And I just--
Speaker 1: And at those parties, would the girls be on one side and the boys on the other?
Speaker 2: Yeah, more or less, more or less.  And, I just said, I can't remember the dates but our group, we had a group of boys.  We used to rent a place in Manhattan [New York] and charge two dollars to come and had parties and we had a band, you know.  We did that for two years and then what happened is the unions got involved and they wouldn't let the bands play, but we had about fifteen.  E. T. [HistoryMaker E. T. Williams] was one of the fellows.
Speaker 1: Oh E. T. was--so you've known E. T. that long?
Speaker 2: Oh, I've known him.  I knew his grandparents.  I knew his parents [Elnora Bing Williams Morris and Edgar Thomas Williams, Sr.].  His parents and my parents [Ernestine Matthews Goins and Jepther Goins] were very friendly.
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: And, occasionally I'd stay at his house in Brooklyn because it was too far to come back to Queens at night, but E. T., fellow Bannister [Eric Bannister] who I mentioned, Stuart Taylor, there was a group of fellas that we used to see and give the parties.
Speaker 1: Wow.  So that's a long time knowing people when you think about it.
Speaker 2: In fact, Dr. King [Aurelius King] sent, when I was finished I was out of med school [Howard University College of Medicine, Washington, D.C.] and out of training and everything and I used to work out of his office sometimes in Brooklyn, and he asked me to make a house call in Brooklyn and I said, okay, so I went to see, and when I got there this old lady, and up on the mantel was E. T.'s picture.  It was his grandmother (laughter) that he had sent, he had sent me to see.
Speaker 1: Wow!
Speaker 2: So it's a small world.
Speaker 1: It's a small world (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Story_ID: 632114
Speaker 1: This is, so the community while you, you know, your, your father [Jepther Goins], you know you didn't have a lot of contact with, you know--
Speaker 2: His family, yeah.
Speaker 1: --his family and your mother [Ernestine Matthews Goins] wasn't living [sic.]--you still developed, they had a nice network of friends.
Speaker 2: Well, I also had Jack and Jill [Jack and Jill of America, Inc.] and all of that stuff.
Speaker 1: You were part of Jack and Jill?
Speaker 2: Yes, I was.  Now I got involved through, once again, Eric [Eric Bannister] and Stuart [Stuart Taylor] at Stuyvesant High School [New York, New York].
Speaker 1: Oh, I see.
Speaker 2: So, they said, and at that time I joined, you know, my mother reluctantly went along with it, but I got involved, the girls and the fellas and everything what was there, and they also had houses out in Sag Harbor [New York], where we have a house now.  And I would go out there and stay with Eric at Eric's house.
Speaker 1: Because Jack and Jill now, Jack and Jill, I don't know when it started but it started in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  When did it--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Bill Pickens [William Pickens III].  Bill Pickens is also, he was involved.  His mother [Emilie Pickens] was one of the founders.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I mean, you're early on Jack and Jill, in the creation.
Speaker 2: Well, yeah.  This is a long time ago.
Speaker 1: Yeah, no.  So tell me about the--
Speaker 2: I'm early, I'm an old man, that's why (laughter).
Speaker 1: I know, but tell me about the early parts of Jack and Jill, so how did it, you know, because it's manifested into a big thing.
Speaker 2: Well, I got involved basically for the girls.  There was no other reason.  They said, "Well come.  We got pretty girls."  So that was it.  I had no particular.  You know, and I didn't know, I knew the boys because we were in school together.  They were in my homeroom, and the, so that's how come I got involved.
Speaker 1: See, you didn't have to blush about that (laughter).
Speaker 2: What's that?  No, there's nothing--no.
Speaker 1: So there were pretty girls.  So--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 632115
Speaker 1: Is that where you met your wife?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: No.  Okay.
Speaker 2: I met her--
Speaker 1: So you were looking far and wide (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Well, I was also young at that time.
Speaker 1: I know.  I'm kidding.
Speaker 2: I'm four and a half years older than her.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And I met her at a young age.
Speaker 1: Right.  She was young.
Speaker 2: So I met her at [HistoryMaker] Gordon Parks' house.  Well, that was another reason.  Gordon Parks had a daughter, Toni [Toni Parks-Parsons], the photographer, and they lived up in White Plains [New York], and there was Liz Campbell [Elizabeth Campbell Parks], E. Simms Campbell, the cartoonist for Esquire magazine, the Sultan, he had a daughter, and another one, Joyce, Joyce Dean [Joyce Edley Dean], and they were all up at Toni Parks', and we had, once again, this fellow Eric Bannister, who passed.  He was a very good looking guy and all the girls wanted him and he would bring his friends (laughter) so that's--
Speaker 1: So it was good (laughter).  So you got (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It was good for everybody.  That's how I met Charlynn [HistoryMaker Charlynn Goins] (laughter).
Speaker 1: Because he couldn't take them all for himself (laughter).
Speaker 2: He could bring his friends, and so we had, it was very, very, so I met a lot of people through just the Williams and we had, you know, and they would have parties and meet people all over the city, all over New York [New York].
Speaker 1: But what--
Speaker 2: Brooklyn [New York] had their own chapter of Jack and Jill [Brooklyn Chapter of Jack and Jill of America, Inc.], by the way.  And Manhattan [New York] had a chapter and we, as I said I lived in Queens [New York] but I was in the Brooklyn chap.
Speaker 1: Yeah, but what we also need to be clear about is that this was for the solidly middle class African American (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) They had a lot of negative (laughter) in those days.
Speaker 1: And there were--a lot of what?
Speaker 2: A lot of, things were different in those days.
Speaker 1: Well, explain that.  This is for history's sake, so you can't just--
Speaker 2: Well, it was upper middle.  It was middle class--
Speaker 1: Or upper.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: It was--
Speaker 2: Not that I was in that group other than being at Stuyvesant [Stuyvesant High School, New York, New York] and friends of their son.
Story_ID: 632116
Speaker 1: But also explain more about the organization [Jack and Jill of America, Inc.], because you had to, you know, there, even now people have fallen out, they, you know, they had to be invited in.
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, it was invitational then but I, the only reason that I guess I was in was because I was friends of their sons and both of them, so they, I guess they were calling the shots as much as their parents in terms of one of their parents' friends, so that's how I got in.
Speaker 1: And, so I also want to understand because nowadays the meeting of girls, I mean these were supervised arrangements in some respects--
Speaker 2: Yes, that's--
Speaker 1: --and you dressed up, you know, like there was a certain decorum.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: The women, there is a certain decorum, you know.  It wasn't, so can you explain?
Speaker 2: Well, they, the parties were, you know, usually the parents were around someplace, I assume.  They weren't in the parties, but our group, we had a group of young men called the Centurions, and we even sponsored somebody in one of the cotillions, the lengths of one of those cotillions; in fact, we did Liz Campbell [Elizabeth Campbell Parks], E. Simms Campbell's daughter and they--it was, you know, there would be parties in Manhattan [New York], you know, and some of the people would be invited and it was, it was a reasonable social scene and I guess New York City [New York, New York] is so large that the, there were a number of people involved.
Speaker 1: And so, what, so that part is impacting you, influencing you as a young teenager.  Are there other things?  What are you aware of the world outside of your community and are you--?
Speaker 2: Well, when I finally got to college [Lincoln University, Lincoln University, Pennsylvania], I mean, I was able to work during the summers.  I worked in a post office [U.S. Post Office Department; U.S. Postal Service].  My dad [Jepther Goins] got me a job.
Story_ID: 632117
Speaker 1: Okay, but before we get to college, before the Lincoln [Lincoln University, Lincoln University, Pennsylvania], 'cause you explained that some of your friends back then, you know, the Ivies [Ivy League] would only have two slots--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --for the most part for African Americans--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --right?  So, you go to Lincoln, which is African, an HBCU [historically black colleges and universities]--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --in Pennsylvania.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So, what do you know about Lincoln before you go?
Speaker 2: Nothing.  Not anything specific other than what Dr. King [Aurelius King] probably told me at the time.  But I didn't have any ties to Lincoln or anything like that.
Speaker 1: So who, so describe the environment that you come into.
Speaker 2: At Lincoln?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: It was, it was all boys at the time that I was there, and there were about three hundred, maybe four hundred students undergraduate.  Things like the Barnes collection that they were supposedly running at that time, or at least involved with, I didn't even hear of that until I was out--
Speaker 1: Much later.
Speaker 2: Much later, although one of my friends, Ernie Hill [ph.], he was aware of it.  He was also a few years, about four or five years ahead of me at Lincoln and he did attend some of the things at the Barnes, but I wasn't involved with that but it was an all-boys school.  We were about an hour out of Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], an hour and a half or so outside of Baltimore [Maryland], and the, there was nothing to do but read and study and play sports, and I had a job of emptying the wastepaper basket in the gym.  At that time, everybody got the same salary, if you worked in the cafeteria twice a day for six days a week or something and you got twenty dollars, so I was very privileged to empty this wastepaper basket in the gym once a week or so.  They were working daily, these poor guys.
Story_ID: 632118
Speaker 1: It was very, very good.  I got into politics in the school.
Speaker 2: In what way?  In what capacity?
Speaker 1: Well, I was president of the sophomore, junior and senior class.  I was vice president of the school, and I was (unclear) of Kappas [Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity].
Speaker 2: Oh, so you joined the Kappa, you became a Kappa and joined the fraternity.
Speaker 1: Most of the people in New York [New York] were Ques [Omega Psi Phi Fraternity], but I got involved with Kappa because Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] and Baltimore [Maryland] had big Kappa and our Kappa was one of the things on our school, so--
Speaker 2: So you, had you taken a leadership role before in high school [Stuyvesant High School, New York, New York] at--
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: So what made you change and take a leadership position in college?
Speaker 1: Well, it was a question of getting into med school.
Speaker 2: I see.  So you were looking at what would make you a good candidate then.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think everybody was.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay.  I see.  Okay.  I thought that only happens now.
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) No.
Speaker 2: So, what did you learn, though, in taking a leadership position like that?
Speaker 1: Well, you know, I went, Max Robinson [ph.] was a friend of mine, one of the fellows from Brooklyn [New York]; about four of us from Brooklyn, Brooklyn fellows went down to Lincoln [Lincoln University, Lincoln University, Pennsylvania] at the same time (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So who were they?
Speaker 1: Chris Chisholm [Christopher Chisholm], Mark Parks [Mark Parks, Jr.], Conrad Pope, and myself.  And, I guess after the first year I can remember going to a meeting with Max and telling Max to nominate me for this position and that's how it started, and the, I had, it was interesting.  You know, you meet people and what not.  Dorm proctor went there, supposedly keeping it orderly in the dorm and not have any women in there and all of this business, and fortunately, they had two dorm proctors, but we had a private room, bath, everything in the dorm because it was a brand new dorm.  The other guy was just a tremendous guy and he was a veteran that was also dorm proctor, so, anyway we were responsible for keeping order in this dorm (laughter).
Speaker 2: And did you keep order?
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, we did what we were supposed to do.
Speaker 2: Okay.  (Laughter) So the thing I want to ask, who was the president at that time?  Was it Horace Mann Bond?
Speaker 1: Bond had just about left a year or so before.
Speaker 2: Before you got there.
Speaker 1: Before I got there.  I think he may have still been there a year, but he wasn't there very long.
Speaker 2: I see.  Because he had been the first black president.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Of, and I was wondering who succeeded him, was it black or white?
Speaker 1: I don't even remember now.
Story_ID: 632119
Speaker 1: At Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia], they talk about Morehouse men, was there ever something like a Lincoln man, and did you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, yeah, they mentioned that, you know, and I think, you know, they will often bring up some statistics that they sent more people to medical school and things like that.  I never really questioned it.  As I said, I was very active as a student in college and in the frat, and when I graduated from college I didn't do anything more of any clubs or anything.
Speaker 1: You didn't?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: So that was it.
Speaker 2: I didn't follow up with the Kappas [Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity], I didn't--
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: I didn't join any clubs.
Speaker 1: Was it because just the demands of medical school?
Speaker 2: Well, medical, I was in medical school and then internship [at Maimonides Hospital; Maimonides Medical Center, Brooklyn, New York], and then went into the [U.S.] military for three years.  By the time I went into the military, I was already married [to HistoryMaker Charlynn Goins].
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And, when I got out I was working six days a week and they had, they had the Provident Medical Society of Brooklyn [Brooklyn, New York], where they had a lot of professionals that were involved in medical care; doctors, dentists, what not.  But they had their meetings Sunday afternoon and, you know, it was just inconvenient to get too involved with them.  That's basically it.
Speaker 1: So what courses did you gravitate to at Lincoln [Lincoln University, Lincoln University, Pennsylvania]?
Speaker 2: I was a chemistry major.  I majored in chemistry.  I took all the necessary requirements at the time to get into medical school, and heard very early from medical school in November of the previous year.
Speaker 1: Oh, you did?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Was there something called early admission?
Speaker 2: No.  They just, well, I got early.  I didn't go, I mean I was four years in college, but I, usually you apply in September or so for the following year, so I didn't have any, I didn't have any anxiety about worrying was I going to get into medical school.
Speaker 1: So, what grades--did you have all A's?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Now what, what are you deciding, you have your sights on Howard [Howard University College of Medicine, Washington, D.C.]?  Is that where you have your sights?
Speaker 2: No.  I had my sights on, I applied to one or two white schools; NYU [New York University School of Medicine, New York, New York], I know I applied to NYU.  I didn't get accepted any place but Howard, but I got early admission, sort of.  I was notified in November, I guess, or somewhere, that I would be attending the class, the next class so there was no anxiety about getting accepted any place else.
Story_ID: 632120
Speaker 1: Now you, by this time you've met your wife [HistoryMaker Charlynn Goins].
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay. To be.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Right.  And, so how did you meet her, you said--and do you remember the instance, what attracted you to her?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well I met at [HistoryMaker] Gordon Parks' house, at Toni's [Toni Parks-Parsons] up in White Plains [New York].
Speaker 1: And what attracted you?
Speaker 2: She seemed bright, pretty, that's basically it, and that time she, I, we didn't, I don't think we started going out right away but, you know, she was a pretty girl who I just sort of liked, so (laughter).  It's hard to say after you've been married fifty-one years (laughter).  But she, you know, she had a group of friends and they were, you know, all very pleasant and nice, and so that, that was it.
Story_ID: 632121
Speaker 1: So when you, so you graduate, do you remember your graduation ceremony?  You know--
Speaker 2: Just vaguely.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And then your parents [Ernestine Matthews Goins and Jepther Goins] are there and--
Speaker 2: Yes, my parents were there.
Speaker 1: Because this is a big deal.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: You know, for you and them, to graduate and then, because neither of them had graduated, right?
Speaker 2: No, no.  I don't even think my dad went to high school.
Speaker 1: But there had been a lot of focus.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, can you describe, so you're on your way to medical school; I mean, you actually, I want to know how you were spending your summers, though, in undergrad.
Speaker 2: I was working for the most part, and it's--
Speaker 1: Where were you working?
Speaker 2: In the post office [U.S. Post Office Department; U.S. Postal Service].
Speaker 1: Oh, (unclear).
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was able to repeat.  Maybe one summer I didn't get a job but most of the time I was working in the post office.
Speaker 1: And the post office paid well, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was two dollars an hour as I remember, which was a good pay day at the time (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) A lot of money.  So, you go off, so you get into Howard [Howard University College of Medicine, Washington, D.C.].  What, how do you find that experience, and I ask this, well, no because you've already been at a black school [HBCU] so how do you find that, how did you find the experience at Lincoln [Lincoln University, Lincoln University, Pennsylvania] when you had been not so much, you had been in more white environments.
Speaker 2: I didn't find any problems with it.  You know, it was, I think when you go to some of these schools, there's always the perception that he might not be getting as good an education as my friends who went to Columbia [Columbia University, New York, New York].  I did know, and in those days you knew, I knew most of the kids in the Ivy League schools, which is surprising but it was very easy to do because there weren't that many.  You know, once again, Isabel [Isabel Carter Stewart] was up at Wellesley [Wellesley College, Wellesley, Massachusetts] and we had a numb- we had three or four people at Columbia, and it was interesting because two of the fellows, one of the fellows from Columbia didn't get into Howard.  He went to Howard dental school [Howard University College of Dentistry, Washington, D.C.] and another one, Richard Tyler, got into Howard and then flunked out after two years and went to Europe to medical school [Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Brussels, Belgium].  He finally finished and Robin Bizzelle [Robin H. Bizzelle] was the other fourth guy. I think he came to Howard medical school also.
Speaker 1: So there was no really determination of, so people were going--but this is what we're talking about and you're still talking about high society in the black world, in the education (unclear).
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Those were your friends.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: That's what you were talking about.  So, Howard itself had its own sort of reputation--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --you know, there so--
Story_ID: 632122
Speaker 1: Who is there when you get to Howard medical school [Howard University College of Medicine, Washington, D.C.]?  We've interviewed a lot of people.
Speaker 2: You mean as far as the physicians in my class or--
Speaker 1: Both, both.  So who are the physicians and who was in your--
Speaker 2: Well, I remember Jack White [Jack E. White] was a surgeon.  He wasn't in my class.  He was one of the surgeons, and the, even Marvin Shelton [HistoryMaker Dr. Marvin Shelton] was the, Freeman [HistoryMaker Dr. Harold Freeman], Freeman, I can't think of his name.  He was a resident.  He had just come back from Memorial [Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York].  We see him sometimes in New York [New York].  He was president of the American Cancer Society, and--
Speaker 1: (Unclear) No, no, no, no.  Okay.
Speaker 2: And one of my roommates, Tom Zachary [Thomas Zachary], he was at Lincoln [Lincoln University, Lincoln University, Pennsylvania] with me.  He's passed.  Howard Wood is another fellow who was there.  There was a guy, that's about it.  I don't have any, I didn't have a great time in medical school particularly.
Speaker 1: You didn't?
Speaker 2: No.  You know, my first, I went there on a scholarship also, to medical school and at the end of the first year, I just barely made it through the first year.  I was promoted and I had a Jesse Smith Noyes scholarship [Jessie Smith Noyes Foundation].  I don't recall how much it was, but the following year, as I said, I wasn't a great student that first year, especially with that anatomy department, and the, although I'm friends with the daughter of one of the teachers that was in the anatomy department at the time.  I don't know if they ever saw my grades, but at any rate the scholarship was given to the school.  You know, I went there with a direct scholarship from the thing; anyway, the scholarship went to the school and the school never notified me, never said anything, never said you're not gonna get the scholarship, never said anything more, and that really, I was promoted.  It wasn't that I had flunked out or anything, but then I had to scramble around for money and that always put a bad taste in me in terms of giving to Howard.  In fact, about--
Speaker 1: Oh, because the money went directly to the school.
Speaker 2: Or it may have gone to the medical school.  I don't know where the money went, but it didn't come to me.
Speaker 1: I see.  It didn't come to you.  Okay.
Speaker 2: And that was aggravating.  And the last, I guess it was last year, I get this letter from Leffall.  He's--
Speaker 1: LaSalle Leffall [HistoryMaker Dr. LaSalle D. Leffall, Jr.].
Speaker 2: LaSalle Leffall, and he writes asking for money.  Now I have not been back to Howard, never said anything or there, and he asked the doctors to give three hundred, give a thousand dollars, which I thought was kind of small, and then he said you could give it three hundred dollars a year over three years, which I thought was, this is the letter they sent out asking for money.  So we sent, I sent off the money with this pitiful letter, with the letter that they sent, but the whole thing, I guess they're in trouble but they don't even know how to, as far as I was concerned, ask for money but I noticed I think it was the black law students at Harvard [Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts].  They didn't do too much better on one of their fundraisers.  I think it was the law school.  It may have been the medical students but I think it was the law students, and they didn't do very, very much better in terms of giving, giving to the school which sort of surprised me.
Story_ID: 632123
Speaker 1: In her [Goins' wife, HistoryMaker Charlynn Goins] senior year at Barnard [Barnard College, New York, New York], they, well, I don't know if they, I think they did cut the scholarship and their attitude was you made it through three years, you should be able to make it your last year, but that's not always the case.
Speaker 2: That's not always the case.
Speaker 1: So anyway.  But anyway, I know that happened to her too.  And it was the same, same scholarship.  I don't know if it was the same year that I lost mine or not.
Speaker 2: Who was giving that scholarship?
Speaker 1: That was Jessie Smith Noyes [sic. Charles F. Noyes].  That was the name of the scholarship [from the Jessie Smith Noyes Foundation].
Speaker 2: I don't know who that is.  Who is it?
Speaker 1: I don't know too much about her, or if I did I've forgotten.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But in fact, I do remember one of my friends, John Norton [John Norton III], from California--he's a urologist out there--he was two years ahead of me at Stuyvesant [Stuyvesant High School, New York, New York] and he, he was the one who told me this was Jessie Smith Noyes.
Speaker 2: Oh, to apply.
Speaker 1: To apply for the scholarship.
Story_ID: 632124
Speaker 1: You know, but what strikes me is a lot of the people who have done well in society were your friends.
Speaker 2: Yeah, we've been very, very fortunate in terms of the people that we, that we know.
Speaker 1: But medical doctors, I mean black medical doctors, that was very prestigious.
Speaker 2: Well, we went to a cocktail party, a birthday party about five years ago at the Harvard Club [Harvard Club of New York City, New York, New York].  I don't know if you knew Gayle Atkins [Gayle Perkins Atkins].
Speaker 1: I know the name.
Speaker 2: She just recently passed from breast cancer.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And Charles Atkins [HistoryMaker Charles N. Atkins] was a Harvard [Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts] lawyer, is a Harvard lawyer; Charles, her husband.  Anyway, we were sitting there and [HistoryMaker] Richard Parsons was there, Ken Chenault [Kenneth Chenault] was there, a lot of people of banker, investment banker types and she went around the room with everybody, and there must have been about fifty couples.  They had, you know, in terms of how she knew everybody and what not.  So, when she got to me, and we go to a lot of these things through Charlynn [Goins' wife, HistoryMaker Charlynn Goins] because the league, of the lawyers.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: She got to me and she said, "You know, doctors used to be big time, but no more."  (Laughter) And, you know with the investment bankers--
Speaker 1: That's right; no, it's true (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Can't sit next to Ken Chenault.
Speaker 1: That's right (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: No, but it was really, you were at the top, there wasn't anything higher than a black--well, doctors period but a black doctor, I mean it was higher than even lawyers.  I think the pay was better or something.
Speaker 2: Probably.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: But any rate, she says so, we often laughed about that (laughter) for, for a good while.  But it is true.  The investment bankers did much better.
Story_ID: 632125
Speaker 1: So, are you deciding what kind of medicine you want to practice before or during or after?
Speaker 2: Well, no, while I was there at, in medical school [Howard University College of Medicine, Washington, D.C.] I thought I would go into endocrinology, but I never did.  I did internal medicine and cardiology training, but I was, I had to go in the [U.S.] military.  I was drafted.
Speaker 1: Well, let's talk about that.  First of all, you decide you're gonna propose [to HistoryMaker Charlynn Goins] first, right?
Speaker 2: Well, I, yeah, we were already married at the time.
Speaker 1: (Unclear).
Speaker 2: Yeah, I married my senior year in medical school and she was a senior in Barnard [Barnard College, New York, New York].
Speaker 1: That's what I'm saying.  Well, I hadn't finished you in medical school yet.  You finished yourself (laughter).  You can't try to rush me, Dr. Goins [HistoryMaker Dr. Warren Goins] (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: Did you rush your parents, your patients this way?  (Laughter) And so, anyway so, no you got married while you were in--
Speaker 2: Medical school, yes.
Speaker 1: Right.  So what made you decide to propose?
Speaker 2: There wasn't anything that sparked.  We had been going, I guess, together for two years or so, three years, and it was obvious I was going to graduate and she was going to graduate and we got married.  It wasn't any, not that I can remember anything pushing us to marry.
Speaker 1: So you commuted, I mean she was here--
Speaker 2: In New York Trailways [Trailways of New York], buses (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right.  Back and forth, okay.
Speaker 2: I used to leave New York [New York] at say two or three in the morning and get down to Washington [D.C.] at seven or so, and then go right to the hospital.
Story_ID: 632126
Speaker 1: 'Cause she [Goins' wife, HistoryMaker Charlynn Goins] was talking about how, you know, she was a married student at that point (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's right.
Speaker 1: -- still going to Barnard [Barnard College, New York, New York].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  And then you finish and then you join--you get drafted, right?
Speaker 2: Drafted.  I interned.  First I finished medical school [Howard University College of Medicine, Washington, D.C.], then you intern for a year.
Speaker 1: So you interned where?
Speaker 2: I came back to New York [New York] to intern at Maimonides Hospital [Maimonides Medical Center] in Fort Hamilton area of Brooklyn [New York].
Speaker 1: Oh, I don't know where Maimonides is.
Speaker 2: It's the best hospital, the largest hospital in Brooklyn.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And so how was that experience?
Speaker 2: Well, that was different.  Once again, they had the intern matching program the year before, and there weren't many black doctors in the hospitals in New York City.  Most of them went to Harlem [New York, New York] or something like that.  But anyway--
Speaker 1: Most of them did.
Speaker 2: At any rate, I went to Maimonides and there were two other black physicians there on the staff and the, it was a very nice experience.  It was a kosher hospital.  You know, all the food was kosher.  Some of the, one of the doctors, Dressler [William Dressler], he'd be speaking German or Yiddish.  I didn't get too much out of him but, you know, when we went to see the patients--but they had prestigious doctors there and it was, as I said, the best hospital, one of the best hospitals in Brooklyn if not, it's the best period (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, the question is, okay, so you did that, I mean how did you get that placement?
Speaker 2: Well, they had intern matching.  That was the things where you just sort of apply to your first four or five picks and they all went into, back to a group and I guess they tried to divide up the interns and residents as best they could to match their first choice of hospitals.
Speaker 1: But were you, you said that it was you and another black person?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Because most times I've heard of black doctors going to Harlem Hospital [Harlem Hospital Center, New York, New York].
Speaker 2: Yeah, well that was the trend.  And the black doctors haven't increased over the years either.
Speaker 1: Right, that's right.
Speaker 2: And unfortunately to the population they're still the same, small percentage.
Speaker 1: So when you go there, do you have experiences or can you describe your experience with the patients and if--
Speaker 2: No.  One lady one time said she didn't want me to be bothered with her because I didn't have enough gray hair and they put me out of the room, and I thought that was the issue (laughter) and not that I was a black physician; I just didn't have the gray hair, and she said to toto "Send somebody in here with some gray hair," but that was the, and that, and I had, nothing that I was aware of.  I had, you know, a nice year.  We worked very hard in those days because we had more hours.
Speaker 1: Now, so how did, what were the hours back then?
Speaker 2: Well, I think I worked 120 hours a week.  I slept in the hospital.  If I was off for the weekend, I went in on Thursday morning and I got off Saturday afternoon and that was my weekend off.  I was due back Monday morning and I'd work right on to Tuesday afternoon.  So, it's a lot of hours.  Apparently they had a death in Cornell [New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center; NewYork-Presbterian Hospital/Weill Cornell Medical Center, New York, New York], a young woman, a tragic death, and her father was one of the editors on The New York Times and they complained about the doctors' hours throughout the city and they cut back so they're working shorter hours now and that's been for the last twenty years, they're working shorter hours (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, now you see that there was a trend towards that.  So you, were you, in medical school you were training to be prepared for that.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, are you enjoying practice at this point?
Speaker 2: I enjoy practice.
Speaker 1: No, but I'm talking about when you're a young intern (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But there was something about the experience, you said that it was just okay.
Speaker 2: That was in med school.
Speaker 1: Oh, but once you start practicing you're--
Speaker 2: Oh, I had a great time, we had a great.
Speaker 1: You're, okay.
Story_ID: 632127
Speaker 1: Then you get drafted [into the U.S. military].  Is that when you get drafted?
Speaker 2: Yeah, they had the Berry Plan.  So, you signed up when you were in medical school that they wouldn't interfere with your education until you finished either your residency or your internship.  So, I had signed up to go in after my internship [at Maimonides Hospital; Maimonides Medical Center, Brooklyn, New York] and in that, all my other friends didn't have to go because they were not physicians but they were drafting physicians.  I had no choice, and so in, I guess it was '64 [1964], we were able to call up Washington, D.C., and speak to somebody and they, at that time I was drafted for two years and we offered to, if they sent me to Europe, I'd stay an additional year so that's what they did and I was really thinking of France at the time, and de Gaulle [Charles de Gaulle] kicked us out of France in '62 [1962], so I--
Speaker 1: You meant the United States.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  So I went to, I was stationed outside of London [England] for three years, which was great.
Speaker 1: So, describe the experience.
Speaker 2: Well, it was very, very pleasant.  We were in the little town of Wethersfield [England].  It was sort of equidistant between London and Cambridge [England].  We went, Charlynn [HistoryMaker Charlynn Goins] had a letter of introduction from her history professor, whose wife went to Cambridge [University of Cambridge, Cambridge, England]--I guess in the late '20s [1920s] or '30s [1930s]--was a Cambridge grad.  Sorry, I can't remember all of these names but, at any rate, when we went, we were a little reluctant to go because we were both young at this time and we knew this lady had to be in her sixties, but we did go visit her and when we got there she, a little town pretty close to where I was stationed.  You know, the streets were named after her parents and everything, and they, she started inviting us to her parties that she had and one interesting thing, when I was getting ready to come back home, I talked about English, they were all sort of very soft, wore knickers.  They called themselves farmers but they were all, they all were Cambridge grads and they all were talking about their poultry farm and this farm and they, I'm sure they were MI5 [Security Service] by this group.  This was the ideal group for it.  At any rate, I, we were getting ready to come back home--this was after three years--and they asked me, "Well, where else are you going?"  And I said, "Well, we couldn't go to the continent," meaning France, and they said, I told them I had run out of money, and they said, "You know, we never met an American who ran out of money before."  And that, I found very amusing (laughter).  Never met an American who had run out of money.
Speaker 1: So she was nice to you then.
Speaker 2: Very nice.  Used to include us in all her parties and--not all her parties but a good number of them--so we got a chance to see a different side of the English countryside and remember, 'Europe on 5 Dollars a Day' [Arthur Frommer] was very popular then, so as a captain with five years' experience, overseas pay and we didn't live on the base.  They only had some fighter pilots and some important people who took care of the planes on the base and we lived in a little country village so, it was very good.  We could jump in our car and drive to Paris [France] for the weekend, a long weekend, they didn't care if the doctors were on the base or not as long as one of them was there.
Story_ID: 632128
Speaker 1: So you really, this was a time for you and your wife to really bond as a family (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: --and you have one, your daughter [Hilary Van Kleeck] has been born.
Speaker 2: Was born there, but we were there about nineteen months before she was born.
Speaker 1: I--so you really had time to bond.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Because you really had not, you had both been in school and everything.  So how--
Speaker 2: First time on a plane.
Speaker 1: First time?
Speaker 2: Yeah, they sent me to Alabama for three weeks to know who to salute and gave me uniforms, lots of vaccinations, and then came back to the airport and Charlynn [HistoryMaker Charlynn Goins] was at the airport and we flew over.  There was one little glitch.  They told me, you know, that I would go with my wife and then I got orders that I was going by myself to London [England], and Charlynn's mother [Charlotte Wilson] wrote a letter, I guess, to the congressman and they changed the orders and said, "Okay, your wife can go with you."  And, we figured maybe a black physician going, you know a lot of people from the [U.S.] Air Force were southerners and Midwest, and they weren't sure exactly how a black doctor was going to fit in.  There were five doctors on the base, but when I got there I didn't really notice anything, or nothing but, that was probably the reason why they had said my wife couldn't come with me, but after that there was no trouble.  We lived off in a brand new house, no central heating by the way (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So, your mother-in-law played an instrumental role in--
Speaker 2: In that particular thing, yes.
Speaker 1: In that particular thing.
Speaker 2: Yes, she was very good.
Speaker 1: That's good.  So you, tell me, your wife talked about, you literally drove all over the place from--
Speaker 2: All over Scandinavia, Italy, France.  We didn't go into Germany too much, but I did go over to Germany to visit a friend in Frankfurt.
Speaker 1: So what was your favorite, what was your favorite--
Speaker 2: I liked southern France.  I saw my first palm tree in southern France, and the weather is nice, flowers, food is great, the water's warm.  It really is a great place.
Speaker 1: Now what about your, what did you like about England or not like about England?
Speaker 2: We enjoyed England, you know, overcast, it got dark at 3:30, remember, and it was usually raining so we saw a lot of depression in the office, and then the fighter pilots, because of the bad weather, would rotate through Turkey because they had to spend so much time in the planes to get flight pay and they would spend three months away, you know, so the wives would be left on the base complaining of the bad weather and the rain and they'd be down in the sunshine flying and what not, and one time I said, "Well, we'll go and take a vacation," and I walked out on to the--with Charlynn--walked out on to the flight area and said, "Look, we want to go to Turkey."  So, they basically said, "Okay, why is your wife going to Turkey?"  And we said, "Well, she's going to see the gynecologist."  So that put that all because they had to put something on the manifest for us to get on this plane.  So we jumped on the plane and we get to Turkey and, you know, we're not going through customs or anything and the fighter pilots were there, some girlfriends were there when we got off the plane and somebody said, "Well, why did you bring a ham sandwich to a banquet?"  (Laughter) That's what they told me, so I won't refer to my wife as a ham sandwich.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) No, she wouldn't like that too much.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) No, so.
Story_ID: 632129
Speaker 1: What did you learn about the, practicing medicine in England?  Because--were you, you were on American base so were you, did you see the British system?
Speaker 2: No, but our daughter [Hilary Van Kleeck] did.  She was born there, health people from National Health [National Health Service] came around to see her.  I took care of the physician, the flight people and their families and we were not allowed to use American nurses even though there were some American nurses on base.  We had to hire English. That was part of the stipulation for the base being there.  So, and the English nurses did a lot more than the American nurses were doing at that time.
Speaker 1: You mean in terms of the things that they would--
Speaker 2: Yeah, be permitted to do.
Speaker 1: Like what?  Give an example.
Speaker 2: Well, suturing and things like that, where the American nurses were not doing that.  The nurse clinicians, of course, do it here now also, and they had specialized hospitals so when our daughter was born it was about a two hour ride on bad road to get to the hospital where we were delivering the babies and that, sometimes, was a problem or the babies would come before we got a chance to get them in the ambulance and take them up there, but it all worked out well and it was just, it was, you know, and I'd go home in the--six o'clock, five o'clock, so it was a, it was a nice experience.  I really enjoyed it.
Story_ID: 632130
Speaker 1: And then when you get back, so when you, your time is up, you come back to the United States (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes (unclear).
Speaker 1: Now in your wife's [HistoryMaker Charlynn Goins] interview we learned that you really missed the Civil Rights Movement, or?
Speaker 2: We did, we did, because we came back in '67 [1967] and we were not really, you know, when I came back blacks were much more aggressive and, you know (laughter).
Speaker 1: Well, you had the Black Power movement, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, yeah.
Speaker 1: All of a sudden it's say it loud, I'm black and I'm proud.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And you were eating tea and crumpets.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) That's exactly right.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: But we didn't really have any trouble.  What we had was the Vietnam [Vietnam War] protesting, and what had happened was there was a newspaper that's distributed among the [U.S.] Air Force, Stars and Stripes, and they would say fifteen thousand people or twenty thousand people protesting in Paris [France] about the war, and then you would get The Guardian or one of the local British papers and it would say fifty thousand people protesting in Paris, and then you would get one of the French papers and they'd say one hundred fifty thousand people, so you never really got the straight story.  You know, some exaggerated and some underestimated.  But, we really did miss a lot of the, you know, as I said when we left blacks were so-so, and when we came back black was beautiful, so it was a big change (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Yeah, so you're like, what happened while I was gone and where do I fit?
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: The cities are burning up.
Speaker 2: That's true.
Story_ID: 632131
Speaker 1: So you come back and where, so that's why I'm wondering, like you've served your country, then you come back.
Speaker 2: Back, yes.
Speaker 1: So where are you going and where are your opportunities and does the Veterans--VA [Veterans Administration; U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs] hospital or--
Speaker 2: No, I had nothing to do.  I went to Montefiore [Montefiore Medical Center] at Albert Einstein [Albert Einstein College of Medicine].
Speaker 1: So you went back to--
Speaker 2: I was at Maimonides [Maimonides Hospital; Maimonides Medical Center], which is Brooklyn [New York].
Speaker 1: Maimonides.
Speaker 2: But then for the residency program I went to Montefiore in the Bronx [New York].
Speaker 1: Oh, so you still had to do your residency program after three--I see.  Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, yes, yes. So, I was there for two years in internal medicine and a year in cardiology, and then I went to the Manhattan VA [Manhattan Veterans Administration Hospital, New York, New York] for another year in cardiology--
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: --and then so this, now we're up to 1971.
Speaker 1: Right.  Now 1971, now are you part of any, have you joined like the National Medical Association by this point?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: None of that, okay.  No, America--
Speaker 2: America was very right wing at that time.
Speaker 1: At that time, so it was hard for--
Speaker 2: I assume they're still right wing.
Speaker 1: Right, for black doctors to get involved.  So you're deciding, though, that you want to, so what do you want your practice to be, sir?
Speaker 2: Well, I didn't get any offers, you know.  There were no black groups where cardiology group was, because a lot of the people who came in the same training joined a group of cardiologists at Albert Einstein or something like that.  So once again, Dr. King [Aurelius King] said, "Well, why don't you come over here to Brooklyn and you could work out of my office and do cardiology," and you could join the group that he was with, which was the Health Insurance Plan of Greater New York [Health Insurance Plan of Greater New York, Inc., New York, New York], HIP, and you can work there as a general internist and you can do cardiology for the black doctors and what not that were in Brooklyn.  So, that's what I did.  And, I had a private, well the private office was out of his office and then when he retired and left I kept the office open and that was on Decatur Street, and I worked for Health Insurance Plan of Greater New York as a general internist and I did a lot of cardiology for them, too, and I worked in a group, Lyndon Baines Johnson Medical Group [ph.] for about fifteen to twenty years as their cardiologist and.
Speaker 1: Now, was that affiliated at all with your other practice or, you know, the Lyndon--
Speaker 2: They were all separate.
Speaker 1: They were all separate so you have three different--
Speaker 2: Yes, for a while, yes. You know, different offices, but I was working full time for the HIP group.  The, and that's, the thing is the community, LBJ, this is run by the community.  They went bankrupt when the city, I think it was, I'm not sure of the year.  It may have been early '70s [1970s] or so.  New York City [New York, New York] was in trouble so basically I was working there for no money at all for about two years, and they had a big turnover with their patients.  A lot of the doctors were doing other things, so it didn't matter that they put two or three hours in.  And we eventually got paid when the bankruptcy was, was settled.
Story_ID: 632132
Speaker 1: So, Dr. Goins [HistoryMaker Dr. Warren Goins], what doc- but you've decided you're going to be, your practice is as an internist.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And that you will also look at things related to the heart.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And so what are the key ingredients of--and you sort of take over someone's practice sort of--and so what are the key ingredients to sort of being successful, you know, back then?
Speaker 2: Well, I mean, I think the doctor's personality has a lot to do with being successful as a physician.  You know, people a lot of times aren't aware of their technical things.  What had happened, when I got out in '70 [1970], at that time you didn't have to be board certified or anything.  If you had the training, you could bill.  Like, I could bill as a cardiologist or I could bill as an internist and through the insurance companies they pay you as a cardiologist or as a, you know even if I'm just taking blood pressure, you bill as a cardiologist you get one fee, you bill as an internist you get something else, and then it got to the point where I, with our particular group, with the HIP group [Health Insurance Plan of Greater New York, Inc., New York, New York], they were making a big distinction between specialist and if you were a specialist you got ten thousand dollars more or so for doing the same thing, so that was one of the reasons why I took the boards in internal medicine, and I was one of the few black doctors that had boards in internal medicine at that particular time to be certified and what it did was it gave me a higher notch in terms of reimbursement rate. Now--
Speaker 1: Now, well it also gives you higher status.
Speaker 2: Yeah, well the status was used for initially, if I was gonna teach in a medical school.  But what happened was they, as the years went by, they started using that as--
Speaker 1: The criteria.
Speaker 2: Criteria for competence, which it wasn't really designed.  It was supposed to be a gold star for people who were going to teach in a medical school sort of thing, but then they started using it as a thing for competence, so I never got the boards in cardiology, because I was working as an internist and now they even made it more specific.  You either got a bill as a cardiologist or an internist.  You can't bill one person for one thing and with the different insurance companies, and that makes it very difficult for a doctor who's independent.  If you're with the university, that's fine because then you'll get lots of referrals, but if you're just sitting out there with the cost of things, it's very, very difficult.
Story_ID: 632133
Speaker 1: But anyway, so I was very fortunate.  I was able to work as a cardiologist for the group, read all their cardiograms and a lot of the patients have high blood pressure or something wrong with their heart, even for internal medicine, and I did a lot of consults for the black doctors in the area and, you know, I was listed as a cardiologist and for about ten or fifteen years, and I worked as a cardiologist for Lyndon Baines Johnson Medical Group [ph.], and then when they came in and they said, well if you don't have the boards, we're not gonna pay you as a cardiologist, but it didn't make any difference because I was doing mainly internal medicine, and as the years went on, you're doing primary care, and you got the nurse clinicians, the physician's assistants, they're doing primary care also so it's not the same and the thing of internal medicine has just slipped away.  That's not, we're not doing that anymore (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, now everything is so specialized, but people crave, those who experience doctors, they crave for that.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: But the thing that I'm, so you, so you come back and literally everything really falls in place for you.  I mean this is--
Speaker 1: Yeah I guess. I had no, no real problems.
Speaker 2: No, because you get in a practice, you get the board certification--
Speaker 1: And when I first got back, I was at Montefiore [Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, New York].  Montefiore was one of the first hospitals to have these neighborhood clinic type things.  They were the thing.  Martin Cherkasky was a great innovator of primary care to everybody, and it was associated with Albert Einstein [Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, New York] and they did a good job, but I was working in a venereal disease center at the time.  I was working as a resident in an emergency room at night.  I used to work from twelve o'clock at night to eight o'clock in the morning in the emergency room and then go to the residency up at Montefiore.  But I was working through Montefiore.  You know, they took the senior residents and had them covering.  I used to cover for HIP [Health Insurance Plan of Greater New York, Inc., New York, New York], the group that I eventually desert, where they advertised up at Montefiore for twenty-four hour specialty care and they would send the senior residents to the homes or what not and then I would tell them what was going on the next morning to the private doctors, because these were all, you know, private, private patients.  So it worked out very, very nicely for me.  You know, I had no, no real problems at all.
Story_ID: 632134
Speaker 1: When you talk about reimbursement and board certification, I sat in the office and I didn't really have any certificates on the walls.  I met one of my patients, I remember one young woman asked me about my background or my certification, but the patients never really asked.  It just wasn't, and I can remember at times being on the office on Decatur Street where the guy said, "Well, how come, you know you're charging thirty dollars and the guy down the street charges twenty," and I said, "Well you'll get reimbursed twenty-five dollars from seeing me, where you're out twenty dollars with him because they were reimbursing at a higher rate to the internist," but you know the patients were not that sophisticated to pull that out, but it was not a problem but there were very, as I said one of my friends, Clyde Turner who I knew as a teenager, was board certified.  He was in Brooklyn [New York], and myself and there may have been one or two others that I never laid eyes on, but most of them I knew and did a lot--as I said, the other specialties, the gynecologist and the surgeons, used to do consults for them at Brookdale Hospital [Brookdale University Hospital Medical Center, Brooklyn, New York] or.
Speaker 2: So, how long does it take for your career to get sort of up and going?  Not very long, you're telling me.
Speaker 1: No, because you know, you stepped into practice with HIP [Health Insurance Plan of Greater New York, Inc., New York, New York].  That was a group.  It was a large multi-specialty group and I just stepped in as the internist, so the practice was there--
Speaker 2: And the practice was there and--
Speaker 1: Yeah, it wasn't a question of building, and with King [Aurelius King] he was getting older.  He wanted to move.  He lived in Queens [New York].  He didn't want to come back to Brooklyn and I'd be sitting in his office and, you know, the patients, or he would tell the patients, "Look see Goins [HistoryMaker Dr. Warren Goins], he's here," or whatever.  So, there wasn't anything and went into groups but not little groups of three or four where you're trying to build a practice.  The practice was already there.
Speaker 2: So, when you're, so we're talking about you return in 1971--
Speaker 1: I returned in 1967.
Speaker 2: Sixty-seven [1967] and then you go into your, not internship but--
Speaker 1: Residency [at Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, New York].
Speaker 2: Residency.
Speaker 1: Fellowship.
Speaker 2: And then you finish the residency--
Speaker 1: Two years in internal medicine.
Speaker 2: Two years.  So that's, and then you did an extra one for (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And then I did two extra in cardiology.
Speaker 2: Oh, it's a four--oh.
Speaker 1: Four--yeah.
Speaker 2: So that's--that gets you to '71 [1971].
Speaker 1: Yes.
Story_ID: 632135
Speaker 1: So 1971, you are, now have you, you've moved to New Rochelle [New York].
Speaker 2: Yes.  We bought the house in '69 [1969].
Speaker 1: Okay.  You bought it when you got back.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, with the help of Dr. King [Aurelius King], by the way.
Speaker 1: That's right, because he helped you--
Speaker 2: With the down payment.
Speaker 1: You had to gather the resources, okay.  Now, whose friend was that who identified the house?
Speaker 2: Joyce.  She was one of the people in our wedding who, unfortunately passed away.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I was a resident [at Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, New York], I was a resident, and my intern happened to be a fellow by the name of John Davis [ph.].  Davis, I think his family were educators and he said, "My father wants to sell his house.  He lives in New Rochelle.  Why don't you go up there because, just in talking to him, and get his house?"  So we went up and looked at the house.  We liked New Rochelle.  We were familiar with the area but it was near a big street or something like that, and our friend, Joyce Dean [Joyce Edley Dean], lived two blocks away and it was a house right adjacent to hers that was for sale also, and that's the one we finally bought.
Speaker 1: So you actually went to look at one house in the town--
Speaker 2: Yes, bought another one (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) and then she suggested the other one, so that is where you really, I mean, that house, I learned today, stayed in the family until recently.
Speaker 2: The price was right for my daughter [Hilary Van Kleeck] (laughter).
Speaker 1: That was a family heirloom.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So.
Speaker 1: So you, this is where this becomes home.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: New Rochelle.
Speaker 2: New Rochelle.
Speaker 1: And--
Story_ID: 632136
Speaker 1: And so you're, but you're working.  Your work is really in--?
Speaker 2: In Brooklyn [New York].
Speaker 1: In Brooklyn, okay.  And what are your, what kind of doctor were you?
Speaker 2: I basically was doing, the majority of it was primary care as an internist.  You know, I would see everything.  In those days if you had a kidney problem and you came into the office, I would handle it.  If I thought there was a problem or that I couldn't handle it I would refer you to a nephrologist.  Nowadays, the patient comes in and tells me they want to see a nephrologist (laughter), so okay, I send him to the nephrologist.  I don't do anything where before the workup would be done.  If you went to the internist and you had a kidney problem, I would order all the tests and do everything that should be done.  Then, if I felt you needed to see the neurologist [sic.], I would send, but all the tests would be done already and he would make his comments, maybe suggest doing some additional tests or whatever he felt was necessary and then send you back.  But the whole thing now is people want to go to the specialist without a referral, so they go directly to the specialist and it cuts out the internist.  As I said, I'm taking blood pressures and listening to chests, like the nurse clinicians or the physician's assistant, I'm doing the same and you can't see twenty-three, twenty-four patients in a day and do a workup.  You don't have time to think.
Speaker 1: Dr. Goins [HistoryMaker Dr. Warren Goins], so you're saying really the role of the internist has plummeted.
Speaker 2: Is gone, not plummeted, it's gone.  And this is a general thing and no one is going into internal medicine anymore because of that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Because a lot of it on the patient's side, we wish they would bring the internist back.
Speaker 2: Yeah, but the internist, the physician, and you're talking about cost.  The physician's assistant could take your blood pressure just as well as I can.
Speaker 1: But you were doing other things in the early years (unclear)--
Speaker 2: In the early years it was an altogether different thing.  I was doing--
Speaker 1: It was the opposite.
Speaker 2: Yeah, even if you're a surgeon in the hospital and the person has an abdominal problem, you're not gonna call the internist, you're gonna call the gastroenterologist.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: So, where before they would call the internist.
Speaker 1: And then the internist, if it was beyond their scope then they--
Speaker 2: So it's a little different in terms of the way, and that is not as satisfying to the internist either.
Speaker 1: It's not as good for the patient either--
Speaker 2: Well, yeah (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) because, special--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --it's not as good.  So.
Story_ID: 632137
Speaker 1: The thing that I, so I wanna, so you're--here you are, you have a young family.  You have a practice.  So what other things are, you know, you have your wife then at soon, soon into that.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Really, not far after you, oh no, maybe about three more years afterwards--
Speaker 2: Yes.  I became a partner in 1973 in the group [AdvantageCare Physicians, New York, New York] that I was at, and in '73 [1973], I think Charlynn [HistoryMaker Charlynn Goins] went back to law school [Columbia Law School, New York, New York].
Speaker 1: Law school.
Speaker 2: So she had been out of school for ten years.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So what made you encourage her to do that?
Speaker 2: Well, she was talking about social work at one time and I had worked, of course, with the social workers and they really were overworked and underpaid and it just didn't make any sense to go into social work as far as I could see as a physician.  I mean, they were all conscientious and hard working, and I thought she was very, very bright and she should do something else and, I don't know if she mentioned to you Eleanor Norton [Eleanor Holmes Norton] wrote a recommendation.  Did she mention that?
Speaker 1: No.  She just said that she spoke to her.
Speaker 2: Well, Eleanor Norton wrote a recommendation for us.  She was a good friend.  She was at that time married to a fellow from Stuyvesant [Stuyvesant High School, New York, New York] who was a year ahead of me.  I had mentioned his brother John [John Norton III] earlier, Ed [Edward Norton], and she wrote this scathing letter saying, "How can you ask the lady, woman who has been out of school for ten years for a recommendation from their professors; unless they were a star. Who's going to remember them ten years down the road?"  She wrote a long letter.
Speaker 1: Oh she did?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: That kind of letter.  I thought you meant a recommendation.
Speaker 2: This was part of the recommendation.  It's what they accept, but she wrote this letter and she was in charge of the office of something in New York City [New York, New York] politics, but she wrote this letter basically saying that they should not ask women for recommendations who have been out of school ten, fifteen years because professors are gone or the people wouldn't remember them unless they were just a stellar student and, anyway she was fortunate enough to get in in spite of the letter.
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: But--
Speaker 1: And a good law school too.
Speaker 2: So she went to--
Speaker 1: But that required an adjustment on your part.
Speaker 2: Well, yeah, we tried to help out.  I worked Saturdays, I was working Saturdays I remember.  I don't, but the adjustment was, you know, to help out as much as I could, basically.
Story_ID: 632138
Speaker 1: But, you know, a lot of men, they might not have want their--I'm sure you knew men who would want their wives at home and not necessarily--
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, yeah.  I saw that in my office [at AdvantageCare Physicians, New York, New York] all the time.  And I just didn't see, I get the women complaining mainly, you know, that they were working and would come home and their husbands wouldn't help out and they'd be watching TV, drinking beer and in the meantime they'd have to be doing all the work, you know, with the kids and getting the house in order and doing the shopping and some of them were very, you know, adamant about it in terms of their not, now I just couldn't see it, and then a lot of, sometimes the fellows wouldn't want their wives to work.  Couldn't see that either.
Speaker 1: You didn't?
Speaker 2: Couldn't see that, because there was no reason if they wanted to work or do something.  And in our group in New Rochelle [New York], it was a nice neighborhood, a number of doctors were in the neighborhood that also commuted to Brooklyn [New York], Brookdale Hospital [Brookdale University Hospital Medical Center] and the surprising thing, this is when women's consciousness was raising, remember in '64 [1964], '74 [1974], women's consciousness raising and this community was very conscious and a lot of them divorced their husbands and went off to do crafts in California and all sorts of bizarre stuff, so I was lucky.  My wife [HistoryMaker Charlynn Goins] went to law school [Columbia Law School, New York, New York] (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: That's true.  It was a high divorce rate in that time, '74 [1974], '75 [1975].
Speaker 1: She said that the women were complaining.
Speaker 2: Yeah, they were complaining, they'd divorce, they'd chuck their husbands and run off to the--one, Dotty Wooden [ph.], specifically I remember, she was doing some sort of scream therapy in California (laughter). So--
Speaker 1: Well there were a lot of things.  Women's lib was coming into--
Speaker 2: Yeah, that was it.
Speaker 1: --play and all of that so, or had already come into play.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 632139
Speaker 1: When she [Goins' wife, HistoryMaker Charlynn Goins] graduates, was there a discussion between the two of you about what would happen when she graduated and what life would be like, because she had been staying at home up to that point.
Speaker 2: Yeah, she was home for ten years.  No, there wasn't very much discussion and her sophomore year, you know, she went and had interviews at the different firms and one guy, one fellow, I think--I can't think of the firm--mentioned to her that he wouldn't want to give orders to somebody, to a young woman or something and she reported him to Columbia school [Columbia Law School, New York, New York], the placement officer, and I think they said something to him.  It was a big law firm that said somebody his wife's age, that was the thing he said he couldn't think of giving orders to somebody his wife's age, but any rate, no, we never really discussed things.  She worked very hard and as a young associate she worked very hard and was basically rewarded.  I thought that this fellow, Jerry Silver [sic. Edward Silver], was one of her people, one of her tax law, he ran the tax law basically.
Speaker 1: Proskauer [Proskauer, Rose, Goetz and Mendelsohn; Proskauer Rose LLP].
Speaker 2: Proskauer.  He allowed her some South African clients, black women.  I don't know if she mentioned to you though in Switzerland for, and the women didn't have the vote, by the way.
Speaker 1: She mentioned that when she was, I think that was Prudential [Prudential Insurance Company of America; Prudential Financial, Inc.], or was it--no that was the--
Speaker 2: Marc Rich.
Speaker 1: When she went to the company.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.  No, she was still at Proskauer.
Speaker 1: Oh, she was still at Proskauer, okay.
Speaker 2: When she went to the--
Speaker 1: Well, she experienced that even later when she was--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, yeah.  But, so anyway it was, I think she ran into some trouble in Japan because of being a woman.  Not trouble, but had a situation.  But, no.  We never really had any big discussion.  She, you know, went from one and always landed on her feet.
Speaker 1: So how many of your friends had dual careers, dual career households?
Speaker 2: I'm not sure but a fair number, I guess.  You know, wife schoolteacher, or something.  E. T.'s wife [Auldlyn Higgins Williams] was a schoolteacher for a while.  Ken Chenault's wife [Kathryn Chenault] was a lawyer and I don't know if she was with a firm, but I mean she got so much other stuff that she got involved with.  And, we know quite a number of women lawyers, Jonelle [HistoryMaker Jonelle Procope] who runs Harlem, not Harlem, the--
Speaker 1: Apollo Theater [Apollo Theater Foundation, New York, New York].
Speaker 2: Apollo Theater.  She, she's full time, and Saundra Cornwell [Saundra Williams-Cornwell], I don't if you know--
Speaker 1: Oh, yes.  I know [HistoryMaker] Don Cornwell.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Don.  Okay, well his wife is a lawyer.  And we see Saundra and Don fairly frequently, as much as we see anybody (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, sure.
Speaker 2: So, you know.  There are a few around.
Speaker 1: So, but because of her, I mean she was travelling internationally and so you're really raising, helping raise the children.
Speaker 2: With the kids, yeah.
Speaker 1: Right.  Or she doesn't have a lot of bandwidth for outside activities, let me put it that way.
Speaker 2: Yes.  That's for sure.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Because if you--
Speaker 2: She didn't join any groups either.  I mean, she belongs to the Century Club [Century Association] or something like that, but it's not, none of the social things.  We let our friends know that we'd like to be invited to the parties and stuff, but we never joined any of the clubs.
Speaker 1: Right, right.  Well, just because there wasn't time.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 632140
Speaker 1: So are you, like, how did the children [Hilary Van Kleeck and Jeffrey Goins] re- how did they react when she [Goins' wife, HistoryMaker Charlynn Goins] went to law school [Columbia Law School, New York, New York]?
Speaker 2: It's hard to say.  She always complained that if there was some bad news they would wait 'til she got home to tell her the bad news and, (laughter) I didn't like to hear any bad news, but I don't know.  Our son is kind of a different kettle of fish.  He is, I don't know, we're not on the best of terms with him.  Our daughter calls twice a day, but our son is sort of, and he's a bright kid, went to Dartmouth [Dartmouth College, Hanover, New Hampshire], but he dances to his own tune and we're not too close with him at this point in time and our daughter, she seems to be very upset about our relationship with our son and she, she has a nice family, three children, her husband does very well and they seem to be happy, which is the main thing.
Speaker 1: And they've been married a long time.
Speaker 2: Yeah, twenty-two, twenty-two years.
Speaker 1: Okay, and your son, he's been--
Speaker 2: He's not married but he has a daughter.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She's thirteen.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, we haven't seen too much of her recently either, but, and he went to Fieldston [Ethical Culture Fieldston School], which is a private school here in New York [New York], then went to Dartmouth and had a hard time at Dartmouth in terms of social and things like that, but got through.
Speaker 1: Do you think, you know they say sometimes, I was just reading that with African American boys.  Do you think that had anything to do with it?
Speaker 2: Dartmouth, you mean?
Speaker 1: Oh no, the private schools first.  Because sometimes--
Speaker 2: No, he seemed to have adjusted very well.  Did very, and they have a very diversified group at Fieldston.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I see.
Speaker 2: And, not at Dartmouth, but he, I don't think, but I do notice a lot of our friends, their sons are not doing, their aspirations for their sons have not really measured up to what they--so I'm not alone in that sort of thing (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) No, because you know what is interesting and I guess this is sort of, I shouldn't be going off on this tangent, but I was just looking at this morning because Carol Sutton [HistoryMaker Carol Sutton Lewis] has started a blog and this is another generation, sort of, and that's exactly what their focus is.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And she started it because she said that the sons were not doing well.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And, you know, and they're going to private schools and they just don't seem as, you know, and what we have to be concerned.  These are kids of means and we have (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You know, and I, a number of our friends, their sons, they haven't gotten into any trouble or anything, but they're just sort of floundering.  They didn't seem to like, go into their professions, you know, on the periphery of music or something like that.
Speaker 1: But, see, it makes me nervous because we can't have, I mean we already know the problem with the other in inner city and then we, I mean it's--
Speaker 2: It's true, I mean, when I stop to think we have, when you do the best you can, some of the, it's just, I don't know what the answer is.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But it's just when you mention that--
Speaker 2: Some of it is entitlement.  You know, people come out, like I mentioned hard work.  They feel that they may just start off at the level of their parents and it's difficult and it's very hard now for the kids.  They come out.
Speaker 1: Well times have changed, even within the--
Speaker 2: Well yeah.  Sure.
Speaker 1: I mean period.  A lot of the, this up here, especially the '80s [1980s], things had gotten at the--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --you know we'll never see those times again.
Speaker 2: No.  Good times.
Speaker 1: Right.  The good times.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 632141
Speaker 1: So let me, so, in tho- in that time period, so I want to understand how, oh wait, no, I do want to--.  I, you were, your patients really liked you.
Speaker 2: I think so.  I think so, and I basically treated everybody like family and had very, very few problems in medicine.  I'm very, very lucky.  And, to some degree, I was also on the administrative side of groups, I mean this is a $62 million group.  We had eight.
Speaker 1: Now, wait a minute.  So when did you--okay, so (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I started with a group in '73 [1973].
Speaker 1: Seventy-three [1973], but then you become a partner [at AdvantageCare Physicians, New York, New York].
Speaker 2: I became a partner in '73 [1973].  I started with the group in '71 [1971].
Speaker 1: But even that time to become a partner is very quick, right?
Speaker 2: No.  It was set where that if you did everything you were supposed to do and what not (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Then you would become a partner.
Speaker 2: And everybody agreed that you were a nice guy essentially and reasonably competent, they made you an appointment, a partner at the end of two years.  That's the way the system worked at that time.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So how many partners are in a group?
Speaker 2: We had forty, when I left the group, we had forty-three, forty-four partners and we had 170, 180 doctors and we had eight centers throughout the Brooklyn [New York]; all over Brooklyn, we had eight centers and we had, as I said it was a $63 or $64 million business.
Speaker 1: But it wasn't like that when you started.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: No.  What happened, there were originally nine HIP groups [Health Insurance Plan of Greater New York, Inc.] in Brooklyn; nine independent groups and they consolidated, all nine groups, and--
Speaker 1: At what year?
Speaker 2: They didn't do it right away.  They first went down to three groups and I would say about fifteen years ago they consolidated to one group.
Speaker 1: Okay, so like in 1998.
Speaker 2: Yeah, maybe even a little earlier than that (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, okay.
Story_ID: 632142
Speaker 1: What were the change- so, so you become partner [at AdvantageCare Physicians, New York, New York] and then what happens after that?
Speaker 2: Well, the point is I was a partner, I was chief of medicine, so that was medicine for all the groups.
Speaker 1: When did you become chief of medicine?
Speaker 2: Well, this was in our private group.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I became, around '90 [1990], I guess.  Somewhere in there.  And, we were running things.  We were involved with negotiations with New York state insurance.  You know, in those days HI [health insurance] went through the Health Insurance Plan of Greater New York [Health Insurance Plan of Greater New York, Inc., New York, New York], so we've seen all the changes throughout the--
Speaker 1: So, can you talk about that whole period and what that involved?
Speaker 2: Well, we had the doctors, the consolidation of the groups like you'd expect.  Our usual problems were compensation for the doctors.  We were paid so much per patient.  It was an HMO type, health maintenance organization, which we had so much money to take care of, total care, of people.
Speaker 1: But when did it become an HMO?
Speaker 2: Early.
Speaker 1: It did?  So it was on the early stages of HMO--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --because HMOs really start taking place, well I knew them in the early, in '80 [1980], but they probably started with '70 [1970].
Speaker 2: Seventies [1970s].  Because I mean it was prepaid.  It wasn't fee for service; you know, we got a flat amount of money to take care of people and we've had, we didn't have like a cardiac surgeon and neurosurgeon.  We paid those people, they were a fee for service essentially, but everybody else was, we had some formula to divide up the pie, but it was a different story.  We would go to the state insurance, the doctors would ask for a 10 percent raise, we would go to the state insurance and ask for 13 percent raise, so the administrators would have a 3 percent float and everybody would be happy until the insurance companies, the state insurance said, "Look, we're not giving you any more money.  You've gotta make do with what you have with," or things like that, so that created a little conflict.
Speaker 1: So how would you manage, how did you manage that?
Speaker 2: Well, our group did very, very well financially all the time, and we had--
Speaker 1: All the time for all these years?
Speaker 2: For all of these years.
Speaker 1: So how, because--
Speaker 2: And our group just, our group just merged with GHI [Group Health Incorporated].  I don't know if Charlynn [HistoryMaker Charlynn Goins] mentioned it to you, but I was going to retired in December, and they merged the group and they gave the doctors a financial incentive to stay, which I accepted in October, start January 1, and then by the end of January, I had medical problems where I had to stop, and so, you know I had new insurance.  I had to apply as if I was applying for a new job, but the, so, the system is a little different now and they just have one group in the whole City of New York [New York] with GHI and HIP, and they made this year a very good year for the doctors.  They gave them significant money for the year, and then starting next year they're gonna evaluate in terms of now the quality of care, they've got a long list of things, you know, with these new exchanges that you hear about, things like that.  So, their compensation is going to change, and they'll probably be lower.  That's the--what I would think (simultaneous).
Story_ID: 632143
Speaker 1: Who are the people that had a key role in your group [AdvantageCare Physicians, New York, New York] besides you?  What are their names?
Speaker 2: Byron Toyloy, he passed away; Leslie Kernessan [ph.], and a black fellow runs the whole HIP system [Health Insurance Plan of Greater New York, Inc., New York, New York] for the whole area, Watson.
Speaker 1: But he ran that starting when though?
Speaker 2: Oh, long time.  But he's still, he's just probably been moved out as of January, when I said in the group, Tony Watson [Anthony L. Watson].
Speaker 1: Okay, Tony Watson.  You know what I find interesting, because you know you would typically hear of the medical profession doctors saying they hated HMOs [health maintenance organization]--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and that there was, you know, they kept getting squeeze, squeeze, squeeze, squeeze, but you have a--
Speaker 2: Yeah, ours was different.  Well originally HIP, the idea was we were socialized medicine because it was a fee, you know, a flat fee.  It wasn't fee for service, but in my way, I mean they should have a single payer for all of this business, and they should give the doctors a good salary and people should not go bankrupt or lose a lot of money because they don't have the proper insurance and have to pay these fantastic bills.  I was in the hospital; my hospital bill, not counting the doctors, I was there for eleven days, it was $158,000.  That's for my hospitalization, and Charlynn [HistoryMaker Charlynn Goins] was just in the hospital recently with problems where she had atrial fibrillation and there were ten, I'm sure, highly qualified people in the room with all of this new equipment.  And that's, I haven't seen any bills for that but I can imagine it's very high.  When I say $158,000 that doesn't include the doctor bills.  That was just hospital bills.  So it's very expensive and all of these things.
Speaker 1: But you said, now why was your group, okay, you see we have to change.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But why was your, so you never complained about the money.
Story_ID: 632144
Speaker 1: And in general, they do a good quality, provide a good service.
Speaker 2: Right, but what, okay, so your wife [HistoryMaker Charlynn Goins] said you had very good bedside manner and that's why you were, you know, really adored.
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, as I said I treated people like family.  Didn't make much difference--
Speaker 2: Who they were.
Speaker 1: --who they were.  And I would say the majority of people in our group [AdvantageCare Physicians, New York, New York], you know, I never found anybody being offensive or anything like that, and our group is very popular.  We had an office initially.  The offices got bigger and bigger.  We moved, we built new offices, but initially it was probably no bigger than this apartment and we had loads of patients and they came from Queens [New York] and they came for not just me, but I mean the whole group.  People were, we had a large number of black doctors.  The interesting thing is most of the black doctors were Haitian.  They had their medical training in Haiti, came here, got their certificates and their residency training here and in New York City hospitals, and then was, it was in this group.
Speaker 2: I see.
Story_ID: 632145
Speaker 1: So you took on an administrative--I'm trying to understand the key, if you could help me--
Speaker 2: Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) understand the key things in your career.
Speaker 2: Well, I wasn't, while I was chief of medicine [for AdvantageCare Physicians, New York, New York], saw my full contingent of patients and I was involved, like for about four or five years, all of these eight centers, would send people to specialists and I would look over the referrals and sometimes I would call the doctor and ask, "Why are they sending this patient out," because one thing, we were an HMO [health maintenance organization], with a collective set amount of money and when you went to another doctor on the outside, the insurance company, they would bill the insurance company and then the insurance company would subtract the money from us and it was some service we could provide.  Our group, before we had all of this condensation into one group [EmblemHealth, Inc., New York, New York], was very good in terms of following the directions and monitoring what should be done and what shouldn't be done.  So, we were, things were good and probably, if anything, they were overpaid, you know, from the state and you know, 'cause one time, when we had a very good accountant who was on the parent company's board of directors, Rappaport [ph.], and he was basically a part time physician, a part time accountant with our group, but he was one of these men who must have been there sixty hours like everybody else, looking at the paper clips and turning off the lights in the different offices and running around, but, anyway it was interesting.  I enjoyed what I did and we opened up a new center in Bay Ridge section of Brooklyn [New York] and I wrote a lot of the checks, too, and I just remembered during the summer, I wrote for twenty-one thousand dollars for an electric bill and I was saying, "Look, why have we got to have twenty-one thousand dollars?"  This is a month for the electric in this building and it was a two story or three story, and they said, "Oh, you've got an elevator."  And I said, "Look, twenty-one thousand--."  And this was air conditioned.   This was during the summer and you'd go to the place, you'd be freezing and I said, "Look, let's cut off the air conditioning."  We didn't have the ability to cut off the air conditioning in that building because New York [New York] had all the controls over in New York, so they keep the air condition blasting, they keep the lights on all night, and then we get this twenty-one thousand dollar bill that we had to pay and, anyway, it was a lot of, some of it was humorous when I look back.
Speaker 1: But wait a minute.  So, you're really talking administrative role too, with the practice--
Speaker 2: Yeah, we did, well, we were a partnership and we had administrators but, you know, the doctors looked over what they could.  We weren't doing the administrative work with the employees or anything like that, but we was writing the, signing the checks and which money went out, and questioned what we thought was appropriate.
Story_ID: 632146
Speaker 1: So you don't to have--do you have any thoughts about where medicine is going in this country or the changes you saw during your career?
Speaker 2: Yeah, lots of, lots of thoughts (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So, what--
Speaker 2: Well, I think the doctors, as the primary care doctors, are diminishing in numbers.  I think the number of patients that they have to see to be viable and financially stable is too many.
Speaker 1: How many?
Speaker 2: Well, in our group [AdvantageCare Physicians, New York, New York] at one time they were seeing people every ten minutes.  Now for an internist, ten minutes, by the time the person comes in I tell them to take off their shirt, their ten minutes are up.  And when you have to see twenty people, you know, and then they increased it to fifteen minutes and their attitude is well, some people may only have a sore throat, you know you can get them in and them out.  But that's very little personal things, and it's, so the load, the patient load has increased.  There's no question about it, and what they've done is substitute physician's assistants, nurse clinicians, to take some of the load off and now they have a team approach where the nurses are doing more than they did before in terms of, between the nurses and the nurse clinician, you may not see the doctor unless there was a problem where you needed some new medication or something like that, but if it was just a question of blood pressure and refilling your medication or checking your sugar, the approach is different, but it's going to be difficult and they're anticipating all of these new patients coming in.
Speaker 1: With the new, with Obamacare [Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, with Obamacare.  And New York [New York] is peculiar.  Medicaid and most of the area in Brooklyn [New York], a lot of ours were in poor areas, our centers.  Well, Medicaid pays very, very little reimbursement rate to the doctor for the doctor visits, and New York City is peculiar in they pay all of their Medicaid fees from the city.  Most places throughout the country, the city pays half and the state pays half.  In New York City, we pay the whole thing, so that's gonna be a burden on the city, and but, that's the way the system is.  I'm sure they'll work something out.
Speaker 1: Over time.
Speaker 2: Over time.
Speaker 1: They'll have to have get it.
Speaker 2: They should have universal healthcare for everybody.  You shouldn't have to go bankrupt and things like that, and eventually, people are just gonna have to pay for it.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Story_ID: 632147
Speaker 1: Were there any down parts in your career, 'cause I don't hear it at all.  I don't hear a--
Speaker 2: No, no.  I can't--things--
Speaker 1: Any difficult moments, or--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, yeah.  Difficult moments?  You mean with the patients?
Speaker 1: Well, maybe some patients.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  No, not really.  No, I've been very, very fortunate, you know, and--
Speaker 1: What about the types of illnesses you started--was there a difference in the types of illnesses you started seeing over your, because we're talking about a forty something year career.
Speaker 2: No, well we've always seen a lot of hypertension, diabetes.  It was a big source of problems with my particular practice, and, you know the people as a rule, when you're dealing with people with alcoholism or addiction, that's a different story, so for the '80s [1980s], we were in a bad area at that time and they're, you know, you'd see more addicts and things like that but within the last ten years, that has markedly diminished and we just see average, run of the mill colds and things like that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 632148
Speaker 1: Let's talk about your civic activities.  Were you, how civically involved have you been?
Speaker 2: Not really.
Speaker 1: Not as much.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Well then I want to go to your art, your collection.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So, tell me because you have an amazing collection here and Charlynn [HistoryMaker Charlynn Goins] says it's you who are responsible for the collection.
Speaker 2: She's just giving me a chance to talk.  She's also involved.  Very (laughter).
Speaker 1: She told me that no.  She didn't even know the dates of her two favorite Bannisters [Edward Mitchell Bannister]?
Speaker 2: Well, we have a book that we open up and what we, we did keep a log in terms of when we bought things and who we bought them from (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) But, no but when did you start and where--
Speaker 2: We started around '87 [1987], '88 [1988] and that was one of the first paintings we bought from June Kelly.  She's an art dealer, black art dealer in New York [New York], and she used to have Romare Bearden's estate and dealing with some of these art groups, especially the dealers, it's interesting.  These two circular paintings here by Duncanson [Robert Duncanson], I saw them and Essie Green [Essie Green Galleries, New York, New York], I think, was the gallery that had 'em at the time and I asked the price and they said, I don't know, they wanted twenty thousand [dollars] or something for one of the paintings.  So, anyway, at that time I talked with Tom, E. T., and he said, "Oh."
Speaker 1: His name is [HistoryMaker] E. T. Williams.
Speaker 2: Yes.  I call him Tom, okay?
Speaker 1: I was wondering.
Speaker 2: I know a lot of people refer to him as E. T.
Speaker 1: They know him as E. T.
Speaker 2: But, anyway, he's Tom as far as I'm concerned (laughter).  He said, "Oh, a dealer showed me those paintings a few months ago and they were offering both of them for twenty [thousand dollars]," so I said, "Okay, you buy it from that dealer and then I'll get one from you," and that's what we did, but you know, it's buyer beware.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: The thing with a lot of this stuff.
Speaker 1: So tell me what you set out to collect, because your collection is in a specific genre.
Speaker 2: We had a limited budget at the time, and we still do but we decided we would get involved with 19th century black American painters, and what had happened was when we went, we started going downtown looking at the galleries initially and we saw paintings.  They were in the three to four thousand range, and then we realized we could get black American paintings in the same range, three, four thousand dollars.  So, we said, well look.  We were interested in the time perspective, say 1850 to 1900, and we said, well, and, you know like reading about it, never really had an opportunity to sit down and read American history, Reconstruction and all of that business.
Story_ID: 632149
Speaker 1: So, we started collecting the journals and the books and--
Speaker 2: What journals and what books?
Speaker 1: Well, we first subscribed to all of them, ARTnews and we subscribed to The Newtown Bee, which is the trade magazine.  It's a weekly that comes out of Connecticut and it has all the auctions and what not throughout the country and it's a weekly paper and if I got one I'll show it to you, it's great, and I would look and we would see if we saw a black artist in there.  I'd call up the dealers and ask them what's going on.  A lot of times they had a website you could go to and look up and find out and so we also, the Maine Digest [Maine Antique Digest].  Not only does it give you the prices that things sell for in auction, it gives you auctions that are coming up and everything, and so that's another, but that's a monthly paper.  So, between that and then ARTnews, and the usual antiques and things like that.  We subscribe to those journals too for what they have, and we started looking for auctions and things like that and we saw an article in The New York Times about Porter and Helen Fusscas had a gallery up in Connecticut--
Speaker 2: Give Porter's first name.
Speaker 1: Charles Ethan Porter, and we went up to the gallery, saw everything and prices were, over the years have really changed dramatically, but in those days we liked still life, we both liked still lifes and landscape, so we started collecting and a number of the paintings that we got, as I mentioned, Bannister [Edward Mitchell Bannister] was interested, was involved with the development of RISD or the Rhode Island School of Design [Providence, Rhode Island] and he was also interested in Barbizon paintings and we bought that about twenty years ago, which is a copy that says (unclear) Bannister.  It's signed by Bannister and it's, that particular painting, 'Distant Tower' ['River with a Distant Tower'], is by Corot [Camille Corot], and it's in the Met [Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, New York], and it went in there about 1908, or something around there.  So, we called up Post Galleries [ph.], which is a big gallery, because they brought in a lot of the Barbizon painters, but we couldn't really trace it down although the person we bought it from gave us an appraisal, Roger King, who sells a lot of Bannister's, he was here and said he thinks that's a forgery, so we're not really sure (laughter).  We're not really sure.  And you know, whenever I, I didn't know they were forged in black 19th century paintings--
Speaker 2: Right!
Speaker 1: --but apparently it's a big thing.  Clementine Hunter, I don't know--she's the primitive painter from Louisiana.  A lot of hers are forged, so there's a lot of forgeries going on.
Speaker 2: Wow!  So what I'm wondering, it's just in that period because, you know, 1850, you said, to 1900.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  We wanted painters that were born before 1900.  That was our criteria.
Speaker 2: Were born before 1900.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So that eliminated a lot.  And it was just nice trying to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And what made you decide to develop that criteria?
Speaker 1: Well, Bannister, Duncanson [Robert Duncanson] were very popular painters and both were 19th century, Tanner [Henry Ossawa Tanner].  So, those three were enough to look around and see, and then--
Speaker 2: How much documentation did you find on any of them, because--
Speaker 1: Well, in some of the old books by Locke [Alain Locke] and Porter [James A. Porter], those two in the front, Harper [William A. Harper], and he's mentioned as an up and coming painter and he had a one man show at the Chicago institute [Art Institute of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois] and I have that brochure.  That's the fellow, Harmon Kelley [Harmon W. Kelley] from San Antonio [Texas].  He sent me a number of pamphlets that had Harper and so, it's been interesting.  We've had Stebbins [Theodore Stebbins] from Boston fine arts [Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, Boston, Massachusetts].  He came here.  He looked at these two paintings and included them in 'The Lure of Italy' ['The Lure of Italy: American Artists and the Italian Experience, 1760-1914'] that these paintings by Duncanson--he had another painting in the show by Duncanson--and invited us to the opening up in Boston [Massachusetts] and whatnot, so it's been fun and it's taken a lot of time (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) How much--
Speaker 1: We have the literature, the bro- some of these old books and catalogs.
Story_ID: 632150
Speaker 1: How much time did it take to educate yourself, and how much--that's one question.
Speaker 2: Well, we've just done it over the years.  I find it interesting and I read about all the artists a little bit and we've always made it our attempts to get to see as much as we can, and fortunately in New York [New York], there are a number of galleries that, you know, have and they'll call us if they get something and, as I said, Charlynn [HistoryMaker Charlynn Goins] is on the board of directors, was on the board of Brooklyn, Brooklyn Museum [New York, New York], and they are making a conscientious effort and Linda Ferber, who was the American curator at the Brooklyn Museum, now she's at the New-York Historical Society [New York, New York], she's, she was the one who got us to give these paintings to the Brooklyn Museum, and she talks about a number of artists, usually Hudson River School artists, but she is fairly well known and a lot of the books are written by her, but we've enjoyed it over the years tracking things down and most of our friends have a nice collection.
Speaker 1: So you have a coterie of friends that also collects.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And, and--
Speaker 2: Most of them, I've seen their collections and--
Speaker 1: So, did they take a similar (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, no, they're there--they're a little more eclectic and have a lot, and a lot of them are into Martin. They're into Martin or like the Washingtons have a number of paintings.  They've donated two paintings to the Brooklyn Museum also.  But, we figured at the time that it would be easier to stick to 19th century and try to improve that rather than a little of everything, and just like the two paintings that, the Harpers that you first see as you come in on the left hand side, they, about two years ago, I guess we bought those last year at auction at Swann Gallery [Swann Galleries, New York, New York], and we, one was labelled.  They both looked the same to me, same technique, and what not.  It looked like it was the same picture from a different angle, and one was, it was clearly, the artist's name was inscribed on a painting.  The other one, they thought it was similar but they just put it, and they centered it.  They auctioned it off as one lot, and we were able to get that.  We sent it to Ken Moser [Kenneth Moser], who is the restorer at Brooklyn Museum to have it cleaned and what not, and when he took it apart, both of them were labeled and in the back, the painting is on a cigar box top and on the bottom of it, it's all written in French, where the guy was, Harper.  He was in France, he was there with Tanner [Henry Ossawa Tanner], so it was, and it's signed William Harper [William A. Harper], so we got the two paintings at that auction.  This one, I went to an auction about twenty years ago in, it was Upstate New York, I'm not exactly sure.  Charlynn was in Germany.  It was snowing there and I drove up there and I paid about forty-five hundred [dollars] for that one and that's in that catalog you were looking at, and when New Britain Museum [New Britain Museum of American Art, New Britain, Connecticut] had their show, they had a number of our paintings in the show, including that one, and after the show they had everybody over for dinner and a few of the dealers from the area were there and the fellow walked up to me and said, "You know, I was at that auction when you bought that painting and nobody had ever paid four thousand dollars for a Charles Ethan Porter painting before," see so that's the thing.  The paintings, you could really get for next to nothing, a lot of them unfortunately, and as more and more people got involved, and--
Speaker 1: Then value went up--
Speaker 2: The value went up, and (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) and up and up and up, because this is, (cough) these artists, basically, and that's, so--
Story_ID: 632151
Speaker 1: What do you know of the history?  What have you learned of the history of each of the people like Porter [Charles Ethan Porter] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well we read, we read through, you know.
Speaker 1: So can you give some--
Speaker 2: Well, you know, Bannister [Edward Mitchell Bannister] was born in Connecticut, Canada, and then spent some time in Rhode Island, and won a national contest in 1878, and when he went to pick up the prize, they wouldn't let him into the thing pick up the prize, and they didn't feel a black man could have done it.  The painting itself has been lost, but the history of all of that is still available and, so, he was a fairly successful painter and he had a coterie of friends and, as I said, they were instrumental at starting RISD [Rhode Island School of Design, Providence, Rhode Island], and in Connecticut, he's a Connecticut painter and a lot of times you'll see an article with no reference to him being a black painter.  And, of course, Duncanson [Robert Duncanson] may have--Bannister never went to Europe.  Duncanson spent time in Scotland and what not and his paintings are, and I think it's in Scotland in the royal family or something they have one of his paintings and he was, he died fairly early too, but he was once considered one of the best painters in the West, and the Taft Museum [Taft Museum of Art], I think it is, in Cincinnati [Ohio], one of the, they have murals that are for him. And the--Bannister, Porter, Harper [William A. Harper].
Speaker 1: What about Porter?
Speaker 2: Porter, we just liked his work and we got involved in the, we have a tile by Porter in the dining room and the author of the book, who I think is (Unclear)--my memory isn't like it used to be--she came to our house to pick out some paintings for the New Britain [New Britain Museum of American Art, New Britain, Connecticut] and she was writing the catalog and mentioned to us that there was an auction in Texas and she said, basically, "Why don't we try to get the tile?"  So, we called and put in a bid and we did get it, and so that's up on the wall too.  So, it's been fun tracing these things down, going a little bit into the history of what's available and in the dining room, we have the large Porter, I don't know if you saw that yet, and we have the Porter drawings on one side of the wall and the tile.  So, that's been it.  And you saw the flies in the, little thing of flies, so we made, over time, and then as we got priced out of the black art, we started getting in with these Amari porcelains (laughter).
Speaker 1: Well, the value of things has gone up, because I mean, people start collecting, but the fact that you were even thinking along those lines--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: You know, 'cause it draws a different--this is not an area that has been explored a lot.
Speaker 2: No, most of the new books are talking about contemporary artists, or they go back to the Harlem Renaissance, but they don't go a little earlier than that, and there isn't that much literature on it.  You know, Bannister, Duncanson, they're always mentioned, but they just started mentioning Harper relatively recently.
Story_ID: 632152
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So what do you think, what do you, what would you describe is the role of the collector, the black collector, and the importance--
Speaker 2: It's to preserve, to preser- You know, we never really thought of our stuff as being big collectors or anything like that, but you know to preserve it, like Roger King said, "I hope you're willing to show it to the general public or if a museum asks for them to let them have it," and we have done that over the years.  I know my daughter [Hilary Van Kleeck] was married out in the Sag Harbor [New York] area, but these two small paintings were up in the Norfolk [Virginia] museum and some friends of ours, much to their surprise, saw our names with these paintings and there was just a little surprise.  They had no idea.  So, that happens occasionally.
Speaker 1: Well, I mean but I think you shouldn't minimize your collection because, you know, the fact that you did this is drawing attention.
Speaker 2: Yeah, well Charlynn [HistoryMaker Charlynn Goins] had mentioned Friends of MoMA [Friends of Education of the Museum of Modern Art] to you.  They've been here at the apartment to look at everything and, of course, Brooklyn Museum [New York, New York] has been here so.
Speaker 1: And the national black museum [National Museum of African American History and Culture, Washington, D.C.] has--
Speaker 2: Yeah, the Smithsonian [Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C.] at least they've been--so, and we're--and we enjoy them while we have them.
Story_ID: 632153
Speaker 1: Just a few more questions.  One: when you look back, well when you look back over your life do you have commentary about how, I mean when you think about yourself as a little boy, you know, living in the projects [Queensbridge Houses, Queens, New York] and--
Speaker 2: No, I have no comment.  I had a very nice life and I was very fortunate to have, you know really, I never considered myself a poor boy when I was living in the projects, never had any, had what everybody else had and it was plenty.  Never really felt anything was, had a, you know, when I look back relatively good health up until last year, no real problems with my, I didn't miss, maybe twenty days out of the forty years that I, or forty-one years that I worked.  When I was at Montefiore [Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, New York] I was going to work and I just didn't feel right and it turned out I had pneumonia.  I was at work, so they sent me home and I was home a few days and then came back and, but, I've been very, very lucky, very, very blessed.  I had a nice family, wonderful wife [HistoryMaker Charlynn Goins], so I really couldn't ask for anything.
Speaker 1: So what are your hopes and concerns for the black community?
Speaker 2: Well, I would, you know--
Story_ID: 632154
Speaker 1: The black community, as I said, it's very easy to--my personal experience have been very good. I had no problems that I can be consciously aware of and everything has really fallen into place for me, but for the black community I think education is the big, the big thing, you know and even more so now.  I was very fortunate to go through and, now with the cost of education it's getting more and more prohibitive and they're going to have to do something, but still you've gotta be competitive.  You've got to be competitive and I don't see where we're doing a good job on a competitive level, and you hear all of these new theories about how children should be taught, how this should be done and too much memorization and too much this or too much that, but the basic thing, I think it takes hard work and I can remember I was already a resident and I, they had grand rounds where they would bring speakers from all over the country to talk and there was this doctor, Harold Rifkin, who was chief of medicine, at the place [Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, New York] and he would always ask a pertinent question and always seem to know more, as much as the speakers and I finally asked him, because we were in a room with maybe three hundred doctors and they're doing all of this stuff, but he was chief of medicine, and I said, "Well how come you seem to know so much more than everybody else," and he said, "Well, I get up three hours before coming to work and read," and that made a big impression on me.  You know, you can't get it by osmosis, and you gotta put in the time, and it's not so much that you're smarter than everybody else, but you put in a lot more time than everybody else did and it makes you stand out, and if you happen to be smarter and put in all of this time, you're really going to be different.  The kids nowadays, unfortunately, they have more distractions than I had.  They got the TV and the phones, et cetera.  I didn't even have a TV until I was about fifteen in my house.  Didn't have a telephone as I remember, but nowadays the kids can watch movies.  You know, I went to a movie once a week, and now the children just have so many distractions that takes them away from reading and math and things like that.
Story_ID: 632155
Speaker 1: What about the black medical community?  What are your thoughts about that, or any young person looking?
Speaker 2: Well, I think medicine is still a very rewarding profession and, you know people say you go into medicine for the money.  They don't go into medicine for the money because these kids know nothing about the finances and the things.  And they have to be prepared at an early age because you need certain courses to get into medical school.  They're trying to make it a little, some of the schools, I know, I think University of Pennsylvania medical school [University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine; Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], you don't have to have all the science background, but still once you get into the medical school, they still require certain courses and you're better off prepared, if you've had at least chemistry or biochemistry in college, makes it a little easier when you get to medical school.  If you majored in art history and you've never had those science courses, it's a little more difficult for you, so that's a struggle but they're trying to do things like that.  They're also trying to shorten the training period a little bit, where somebody, instead of like I stayed four years, but I mean some of the other things like neurosurgery, you know, you take neurology for three or four years and then you've got to take surgery for a number of years, so you're almost an old man by the time you finish, although they're getting better paid in the hospital staff now than they used to.  I was with the big wave where I think I made three thousand dollars a year for those 120 hours.  Now I think that the interns get twenty or thirty thousand dollars a year.  So the price, and, of course, the hospitalization has gone up along with the cost of the employees.  But the medicine, as I said, it's sort of depressing when you figure that they're not producing any more black physicians than they did when I finished.  No significant numbers, and the physicians are certainly working now harder than I did, say fifteen years ago.  They're expected to do a lot more, and big data has made it very difficult; you know, the attitude is if we can't measure it we're not going to pay you for it.  And, now you'll know how many blood sugars I ordered, how many of my diabetic patients are well controlled, which is all good but it takes time and where, when I was sitting in my private office on Decatur Street [Brooklyn, New York], it would be me and the secretary and we would do everything.  Now you have to have an IT [information technology] group come in and computers, so the cost is the finance and it has changed.  But once again, it's still the younger people getting out now, will grow up in the system and hopefully they don't have as many complaints.  After about a year or two I stopped complaining because I was getting ready to leave and I didn't think it was fair for me to say anything negative, when I know some other poor guy is going to be there for another ten, fifteen years with this sort of situation.  So, I stopped, stopped complaining about, you know, what I thought was wrong.
Story_ID: 632156
Speaker 1: But the, the perspective, history as a--also, things tend to repeat themselves too over time (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah.  Well we, as I said, our group [AdvantageCare Physicians, New York, New York] was a very good group, but the morale has changed a little bit in the overall group.  They all, and the younger doctors want a life, you know.  They go into dermatology, ophthalmology, go into something that doesn't have any emergencies.  You know, generally they're not going to GYN, gynecology; you know, being called, and the hospitals in New York [New York], when I was coming through, I mean, if you were in labor you called a doctor, your private doctor would meander in; hopefully, he'd get there in time to deliver the baby.  Now, when the patient goes into the hospital, the doctor has to be there.  So, he might be sitting there eight, ten, twelve hours while you are in labor, and then he had to go to the office the next day or whatever.  So, things have changed and you don't get a lot of the doctors, you know, going into some of these fields unless you're with a big group where you're not on call every day.  Things are changing.
Story_ID: 632157
Speaker 1: So, what do you want to be remembered for?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I never thought--I would like people to treat me nicely while I'm here (laughter) and when I'm gone, I'm gone.  I've always really felt that way.  But, just remember that I tried to do my best and treated everybody the way I would want them to treat me, and fortunately I've been able to do that for seventy-five years.  I don't have any specific things that I would pick out that I would--just a good guy tried his best.  I'm not very religious, or at least, when my mom [Ernestine Matthews Goins] was in control I did get attendance for Sunday school, pins and all sorts of stuff, but we were not very religious, but, so that's it.
Speaker 1: What about, what do you want your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: Well, I would hope that when I go that my family that's left is comfortably provided for financially and what not, and at this point, they're doing very well by their, without anything from me, so I would just, we do intend to leave the paintings to somebody, one of the museums, and that's it.  I was a good man.  It doesn't matter whether you're a Muslim, Jew, Catholic or what you are.  A good man is a good man, as far as I can tell.  It doesn't matter what their religion.  So, just hope for the best.
