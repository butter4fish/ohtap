Speaker 1: My name is Raymond W. Ewell, E-w-e-l-l, and I started serving [in the Illinois General Assembly] in '67 [1967] and I finished in '83 [1983].  I did eight terms.  That's sixteen years.

Speaker 1: I ask everyone these questions.  They have no relevance to anything except they're questions we ask everyone.  What is your favorite food?
Speaker 2: Well, I really didn't have a true favorite, because it changes with time.
Speaker 1: Your favorite time of year?
Speaker 2: Probably summer.
Speaker 1: Your favorite color?
Speaker 2: No favorite color.
Speaker 1: Your favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: There are many parts of many phrases and they change from time to time, so at the current time, I couldn't say that I have a favorite.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Then your favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Probably Michigan.
Story_ID: 45971
Speaker 1: Okay.  But I'd like to just start with your parents.
Speaker 2: Parents were Severine Ewell.  Her maiden name was Ray and she was born in Louisiana, New Orleans.  My father was born in Louisiana, but a little town somewhere around Ewellville, just a little corner there. (background noise)  He was a postal worker.  He rose to superintendent downtown and my mother, the only job she ever had was after we started high school.  She worked at the post office for about 37 years before she passed, and both of them are diseased.  Mother passed about five years ago [1995], father passed I would say 35 years ago [1964].
Speaker 1: Do you know how they ended up coming to Chicago [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Well, they came in the late 20's [1920s] or middle 20's.  How they came, I'm not really certain.
Speaker 1: You don't know why they came?
Speaker 2: No.  Probably economic opportunity.
Story_ID: 45972
Speaker 1: And, when you, can you talk about growing up here [Chicago, Illinois] and what it was like growing up and what were the things that influenced you.
Speaker 2: I grew up near Washington Park on 50th Place and it would have been an upper middle class black community at the time.  Upper class at the time consisted of postal workers, Pullman porters and teachers let's say.  There weren't enough doctors and lawyers to constitute a class, so all of them were together.  We all lived basically in restricted areas, because they had restricted covenants.  Cottage Grove was one of the boundary lines across which blacks did not move.  That was in the 30's [1930s] and it maintained that posture until starting approximately the 40's [1940s], and then after that there was a leap frogging migration of blacks with an explosion starting with the war years [World war II] with people coming in to get jobs and to work in the various plants.  That explosion took place and so blacks began over running previously all white areas, starting at the 60's [1960s] and 70's [1970s] and we had a small community in the 90's [1990s] and they generally closed the gap.  Up until today, the blacks have moved out perhaps all over the South Side of the City of Chicago and the West Side to the city limits, and of course, the migration has gone north.  Now today they're starting a different migration, a movement of people coming back to the city.  It's an integrated movement, but basically it's a -- It would be sort of an upper class, simply because of the prices.  Prices determine your ability to live in different areas.
Story_ID: 45973
Speaker 1: I just want to cover a couple things in the early years.  Were there memorences of growing up that you would like to share, either around your family or about Chicago?  I just would like to-- where were you on the family tree?
Speaker 2: I have a sister, one sister [Odette Martin].  She is a year older and that is our family tree.
Speaker 1: What was the young Raymond Ewell like?
Speaker 2: Well, I went to a private school.  I went to Corpus Christi [Elementary School].  Of course, the tuition was only about one dollar or two dollars a month, but that was a great sum at the time.  My parents made the sacrifice for my sister and myself.  And I grew up -- All the kids played in the alley and we played different games like kick the can, which is unknown to kids, because we didn't have mitts and gloves and couldn't play hard ball.  There was some basketball, but it's only a basket stacked up somewhere.  We played that kind of game, chase one, chase all.  We amused ourselves and we conducted all of our social activities in the alley.  In fact, they used to nickname-- we were the "alley rats."
Speaker 1: Where did you go to elementary school?
Speaker 2: I went to Englewood High School.  Englewood started off as an integrated school, basically being white in the early 40's [1940's] and by the time I left in 1946, the school had become all predominantly black.  I would say almost 90 percent.
Speaker 1: Who else went to Englewood when you were there?
Speaker 2: You might have known [HM] Oscar Brown, Jr.  He was preceding me a little bit, but he was from our neighborhood.  Let's see.  Alvin Foster.  But Alvin is deceased.  His father was the first-not the first, but one of the members of the Urban League and they moved from there to Glencoe [Illinois], one of the first black families to move in the area of Glencoe.  The interesting thing about it is many of the kids who I came up with all went on to get advanced degrees and to move into various fields.  The Diggs' girls, one of them moved into television, with the programming, etc.  She was real active in one of the big shows in the 60's [1960s].  Of course, she retired now.  Many of them went on to fame and various things.  We had a number of kids who became doctors and lawyers.  As I said, it was a middle class neighborhood that was motivated upwardly by parents in particular.
Story_ID: 45974
Speaker 1: Was there a sense that you were special and that you were a certain group? Was there a sense about that?
Speaker 2: There was, because one of the earliest remembrances I have when -- It was during the depression.  I can remember my grandmother used to fix sandwiches and give to people who would come to the back door and were hungry.  They just needed something to eat and she would make sandwiches for them.  We remembered it.  As I say, if you can understand class at the time, we belonged almost to the creme de la creme, because the creme de la creme were the Pullman porters.  I forgot the Pullman porters.  That was the day and age in which the porters were the people who traveled throughout the country, because they could travel on the railroads.  They really were the creme de la creme of the black society.  The waiters and that nature are -- Now of course, it is evolved and they're all different kinds of stratifications.  Unless you belong to the -- You can belong to everything, every classification or stratification that you want until you get to the super people who become literally millionaires, multi-millionaires, the Johnsons, the Michael Jordans, the Tiger Woodses if you will and the Puff Daddys, people who are in the fields, and then of course the various-- the people who are in the entertainment field, the boxing fields, etc., where they become super.  Our creme de la creme was strictly a working class society, and if you stop to remember the actual position of the Pullman porters, they did represent the cream of the crop, because they were able to send their kids to school, they sent them on and they were the heart and soul of the community.
Story_ID: 45975
Speaker 1: Now, your parents, were their -- Which of your parents are you most like would you say?
Speaker 2: Oh, I would say my father [Whitney Ewell].
Speaker 1: Why?
Speaker 2: Well, he was a postal worker.  He had aspired to -- He had wanted at one time to become a lawyer.  He never did.  As I say, I seeded my wildest expectations because the rate of progress of let's say the integration of the schools and blacks becoming upwardly mobile was what we call slow and ploddy, deliberate, as the courts would have said "With all deliberate speed," which meant "very slow." If you had asked me, I would not have believed the progress that I have seen or the fact that I became a legislator would have occurred in my life time, and I hope I have a little left, but I would not believe by the year 2000, I would have seen the events that I saw as early as 70 [1970s] or the 60's [1960s], 65 [1965], starting with the movement by Dr. King [Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] and the Civil Rights Movement.  In fact, [HM] [James] Forman was one of my classmates at Englewood [High School], of SNCC [Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee] and CORE [Congress of Racial Equality], he was one of my classmates there. But I would have not believed that we would have seen the progress either economically, socially or politically.  There's no way I would have dreamed that we would elect a U.S. Senator from the State of Illinois, or that we could at this time, achieved a Secretary of State, or the fact that we could get the minority leader of the House, which is [HM] Emil Jones, or at one time Cecil Partee, who was the president pro tem of the Senate.  That's an interesting story some time.
Story_ID: 45976
Speaker 1: Would you say in high school [Englewood High School] you were studious, did you have what is always assumed -- I'm trying to understand what the young Ray Ewell was like.
Speaker 2: I wanted so much to be one of the fellows that I would sit on the stoop with them and I would just sit on the stoop and I wanted to imitate them.  I played football there and I was on the swimming team.  Those are the only two teams we had.  We had a basketball and baseball team, but I did swimming and the football team.  I was in terms of being a student, I was perhaps only a C student, basically speaking, falling into the trap that most black males have fallen into that for some reason to be deemed studious is not a very cool thing to do, and therefore, I became a part of the ignorant masses, and it was only about my senior year -- I can remember one particular incident.  They used to call the people that made the grades, and the grades were S, E, G, F and D, going downwards.  They would call up the people who had made the honor roll - (background noise)
Speaker 1: We'll start that again.
Speaker 2: They would call people who made the honor roll and the one interesting thing I can always remember is my senior year, the last time they would announce the grades, I think I had made four S's, and when the class sponsor said my name and four S's, was almost in shock, she couldn't believe it.  I did much better when I started in college.  I went to the University of Illinois [in Champaign-Urbana] and I did much better.  In fact, I was in probably the upper 10 percent of the class.  I had about a 4.0 average out of 5.0 possible.  Close to a 4.0.
Speaker 1: Now, why did you do better at that time?  Did you go off -- I mean was it always assumed you were going to college?
Speaker 2: Well, it was something that our parents [Severine Ewell and Whitney Ewell] had instilled, that they expected.  My sister [Odette Martin] preceded me by two years.  She went to the University of Chicago [Illinois] and obtained a Masters Degree in English and it was assumed that we would try to get advanced degrees, because it was one of the few ways up financially, that is financially and it was one of the few ways to advance.
Story_ID: 45977
Speaker 1: So what were your thoughts about -- I'm just trying to understand -- get a sense of where you were and how you ended up getting involved in politics.  But was there a desire at that point for -- I mean did you have sort of a clear sense, like myself, it's taken me-it's been a very circuitous road around, where I've gone -- (laughter)  Some people know what they want to do and some people --
Speaker 2: No.  I didn't know what I wanted to do and I never had super-I never had the pressures put upon me.  It was a matter of -- I guess in college, with the University of Illinois [in Champaign-Urbana].  My roommate and I, because of a lack of employment at the time, we went summers, so actually we were able to finish in three years, rather than the standard four.  Kids take five now and I had a son who took six.  Anyway, it was a matter of finishing that and then I had started -- I had begun to teach and I started to work on a Masters, and then I decided I was going to try to go to law school after I got that, and I was accepted at the University of Chicago, so I went there to law school.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What year was that?
Speaker 2: I went to law school -- I graduated with my Bachelor's [degree] in 1949 and in 1951 I had gotten my Masters [degree] and then I entered law school from 1951 to 1954.
Speaker 1: Let's see -- who was there - this is after or before--
Speaker 2: Newhouse preceded me, slightly
Speaker 1: What about [HM] Jewel Lafontant [Lafontant-MANkarious]?--
Speaker 2: She preceded me.
Speaker 1: She preceded you and so did [HM] John Rogers [Sr.]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What did you major in, in college?
Speaker 2: History and I got an advanced degree in the teaching of history.  It's a compromise between straight history and education.
Speaker 1: So you should be very interested in the project that we're doing.
Speaker 2: Some interest, yes.
Speaker 1: (Laughing) You're retired now aren't you?
Speaker 2: Basically.  Lawyers never really retire, but for all practical purposes, I'm committed to doing the things that I like to do now, and so I'm not really basically engaged in the practice of law for a living.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you decide you want to go to law school.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Was there anything that went into that decision?  At this point you're not a kid any more.  At this point you've gotten on the right track, and so what was the motivation at that time?  We're still historically in a time where -- You said in 1954 you went?
Speaker 2: 1951.  1951 to 1954.
Speaker 1: That's even before Brown v. the Board of Education--
Speaker 2: 1954, Yeah.
Story_ID: 45978
Speaker 1: I'm just trying to understand what was going on in your head [when he entered the University of Chicago Law School in 1951]--
Speaker 2: I think that you were attempting to strive to better yourself and it wasn't that I had that much pressure outside of that.  I started dating my first wife [Joyce Ewell] when I went to law school and I got married just before I graduated [1953].
Speaker 1: And what were your thoughts then afterwards?  What actually did you do after you graduated?
Speaker 2: After I graduated, I went to the service.  I was in service for a little while and I came out.  I thought I wanted to operate a gas station as a business and I found out that that was a job that was 7 days a week, about 12, 14 hours a day and after it wore me out, I sold it out and said look, there's a better way.  I went on to practice law.
Story_ID: 45979
Speaker 1: Tell me about the start of your practice [Ewell, Graham, McCormick, Ross and Davidson]?
Speaker 2: The start of the practice was when I started practicing, there were no Jenner and Block opportunities.  There were no opportunities literally anywhere, and so you had to engage in the type of practice that the people that you knew, and that was basically either they did civil, real estate, divorce and some estate law, a few contracts or you were a criminal lawyer.  As one of the policemen once said to me -- He was talking about another State's Attorney.  He was very brilliant, but he was Greek.  He said "I thought that you had gone to the criminal defense work."  I said "No."  He said "I'll tell you what, in the criminal law you need a feeder system."  He says, "If you're Irish, the police feed you."  He said, "If you're Jewish, the bondsmen feed you."  He says, "If you're black, they represent a great portion of the criminals, so you might get it from that."  Actually, I started off with a criminal lawyer who I stayed with for a very brief time and I started in that field and true enough the only things you could really start in at the time were criminal law and unfortunately one of the fields was the drug field, but I disliked that.  But I ended up doing considerable work with, at 11th Street [Chicago, Illinois], which is almost a specialization.  It was almost like going to a job, because I was doing gambling cases.  It was profitable.  I did gambling cases, policy cases, prostitution, and the light gun cases because they all came up at 11th Street and you became a specialist more or less there, although you did other cases elsewhere.  Anyway, it took me away from basically the drug traffic and the drug trade, which I really didn't like.  That's how I started into that field and I did -- I was pretty much independent about it.  I never formulated my -- I was by myself in fact, at first and then we accumulated people -- I don't know whether you know Mr. Harry Graham.  He was one of the first partners, and the firm grew.  [HM] Leo Holt, who was a judge.  [HM] [James D.] Montgomery was with us for a while there.  Oliver Spurlock, he's a judge.  You might have known Oliver.  A.C. Cunningham was with us.  Carl McCormick, who became an Appellate Court judge, one of my best friends.  We're all part and parcel.  We came into the practice of law.
Story_ID: 45980
Speaker 1: As I said, we grew, and the interesting thing about it we were -- We had an office in the Loop [Chicago, Illinois] and when you talk about the vanishing opportunities -- I had a knack for let's say constructing, construction, and we would modify the offices.  We were at 166 West Washington, which was a small seven story building and we started off in two offices, myself and two court reporters and then they went on to greater things and our office got to the size that we could afford a secretary and we had four, six, and we ended up with about 10 or 11 offices really, and a number of lawyers who were connected.  The interesting part about it at the time, the landlord who was a German gentleman wanted to sell me the building and it was at 166 West Washington.  It's right behind the Jewish Bank Building [Foreman State National Bank Building] on the corner of Washington and LaSalle.  He was going to sell me the building and the interesting part about it is at that time, I don't think blacks had any real estate anywhere, because you couldn't get financing, but he agreed to hold the financing for the building for -- The price was $250,000.  He agreed to take a mortgage back for $175,000.  We needed $75,000 to turn the deal.  Believe it or not, I first went to all of the lawyers, the older lawyers that I knew and asked them if they would like to engage and buy a building, we could each take a floor and I could not find enough of the lawyers to turn the project.  I mean they just didn't have it.  The older lawyers were content at their old locations, which were outside the Loop and the new lawyers coming in had no money.  So we could never do it.  When you reminisce, you'd say, "Gee, if we had just turned that deal, we would be sitting atop of some skyscraper now looking out on the lake."  Then the Civil Rights Movement came in, the possibilities of renting to everybody from the federal government to the state government to the city, to any other agency is now a possibility, etc.  The timing would have been right.
Story_ID: 45981
Speaker 1: I thought naively that black people didn't even go to college before the Civil Rights Movement
Speaker 2: In reality, one of the fellows who became a judge, he's retired now too, said "Gee, you know, you always inspired me because you went to the University of Chicago [Illinois] and I didn't even know people could go to law school.  He was in either grammar school or high school at the time.  It was just interesting.  What happens is so often people fail to realize the difficulties that the people who came before had to go through.  In other words, just like people who didn't experience say segregation in the South.  They had no concept of what it was to exist with Jim Crow seating on the trains where they moved you when you crossed the state line, or the fact that you couldn't eat at places, you couldn't sleep at places.  They had no concept.  People will frequently talked about how they wouldn't have taken this, they wouldn't have taken that, and they wouldn't have taken the other, but the point of it is, the people preceding had no other choices, they had to take it and you have to see what their problems were.  It's easy to say that yes, you can be a great spokesman for civil rights when it's popular, but when it was very unpopular and when the society's administration frowned upon it, then you had no other place to work and you had to have a job and you had to have something to do.  It was no wonder that the clergy who were basically supported by their own populations, were the only people who were able to engage in this type of activity, because you didn't have firms say like Jenner & Block where you worked where they could pro bono, do work on Civil Rights matters.  You just didn't have it.
Speaker 1: That's what I'm trying to understand.  I'm trying to have you help us put this all in context.  It seems you were a defense lawyer right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you had identified a niche.  I remember when I started out, a lot of times there were more whites defending, we saw a lot of white defending black clients instead of visa versa.
Speaker 2: Well that's still true. Still true.
Story_ID: 45982
Speaker 1: So I'd like you to share the stories of building your practice and that whole thing. What was happening here in Chicago? What were the contexts that you were operating in?
Speaker 2: The contexts in Chicago were, at the time were sort of unbelievable.  The amount of what people--I guess we were like a third world country in terms of corruption.  It was just ingrained and it was just part of the fabric of society.  Everybody, literally everybody was doing some part of wrong.  I mean the police department was -- They did everything you could think of.  You almost had to pay a toll to drive down the boulevard, but it was a reasonable toll and better than going to jail, etc.  The police were taking money.  Not all, but a large number of them.  Even at the time some judges were corrupt.  It extended up the line.  The jobs on the police department were for sale, you bought them, literally.  The politicians operated in the fabric that they had to, but here again it was like -- I guess I was sort of an anti-Dawson [United States Congressman William L. Dawson] person, because I always considered Dawson to be one of the handkerchief heads of the business.  From a later prospective, Dawson was doing what he had to do in order to get along and in order to proceed, because it's easy to say in retrospect, you should have been one of the Civil Rights fighters and out there fighting every battle, etc.  Then he said I could get no jobs to help any of you and the people. As Dawson would say, "When you take a man and get him an education, then he wants your job and in addition he feels that the world knows him a lot."  Whereas Dawson's position is I will take ten garbage jobs or ten jobs of lesser importance, rather than one job of a supervisor, because if I get one supervisor, he then thinks he's brighter than I am, he doesn't want to help with the association or anything else, but if I get ten garbage jobs, these guys will go out and ring doorbells for me.  So actually he was better off.  He did what he had to do.  Dawson did help create though, some of the first black judges, some of the other people.  He was a powerful figure.  He did what he had to do at his time, because he did not have the support level, blacks did not have the financing to stand up and be independent so to speak.  You got to have an independent ability to earn an income if you're going to be independent.  Dawson, although I never voted to him, I was always opposed to him, I was always with the other radicals so to speak -- You had a better appreciation once you've had to walk in their footsteps and you understand that somebody has to do the things that have to be done in order to make certain progress.  Let's say that a man's intelligence has to be judged by his ability to survive in his environment.  So a savage who can survive in the jungle is a very intelligent man, whereas you might take some very brilliant people who can't survive in either the jungle or maybe as the Eskimos do in the north.  It's the ability to survive.
Story_ID: 45983
Speaker 1: Now, I'm curious. You could have-- could you have at that time gone into a civil service job?  They would have been hard.  I'm surprised at the nature of your practice, in a way, given your background.
Speaker 2: You have to understand that your only choice is to work with another lawyer and you have to follow their practice, whatever their practice is, because there were not the openings.  You could not work at the Title company, you could not work for any of the other agencies that people have come to work for, it simply didn't exist.  You had to take whatever you could get, and that unfortunately was the set of circumstances.  Yes, politically if you hooked up politically, like the [United States Congressman William L.] Dawson regime, they could have gotten you a job in various capacities and even [Mayor] Harold Washington was a hearing officer at the--for workman's compensation when he started off.  He was a machine candidate.  He came up through [C.C.] Wimbush and the like.  He was with the old 3rd ward and it's just that Harold became more radical in his later years.  In fact, when we first got to the [Illinois General] Assembly, one of the things that disturbed us was [State Representative] Corneal Davis, who was the senior member had been there -- He served 36 years in all, but he had been there almost 30 years and he had no status in terms of leadership or anything in that regard.  This was after the general election of '64 [1964] in which they re-divided the State of Illinois and we achieved a number of other districts.  The picture that I brought you would illustrate the number of legislators that we had.  For the first time you had independent legislators, black independents.  Other than that, all of them belonged to the Democratic Party.  Now, the Independent ones were [Illinois State Senator Richard] Newhouse, who was elected in the liberal Hyde Park area and Charlie Chew, who was elected alderman in the 17th ward and then Charlie ran for senator and that was the election in which I won, although I won as an organization candidate, but Charlie was an Independent.  Newhouse was an Independent.  The others in the senate, Fred Smith was strictly an organization man, along with a couple others.  They were organization people, as almost all of the other House members were.  Lewis Caldwell, deceased, was one of the Independents, but Lewis had an independent way of making a living.  So did I.  I never had a political job, which colors your thoughts.  Lewis and myself and Harold were two of the firebrands that because we did not have political jobs.  Harold didn't have one then, because he really had really gotten independent.  Otis Collins did the very best that he could, but he came from the West Side in an era shortly after Ben Collins.  That's where they'd shoot you over there.  Politics on the West Side was very, very rough.  Otis was about as liberal and made as many steps as he could.  The steps that he made were amazing, but other people would call him a handkerchief head, simply because they said he didn't go far enough, but they failed to realize the condition that Otis was operating in.
Story_ID: 45984
Speaker 1: In regards to politics, after I came out of school I first -- My first foray into politics was 1948 when I believed that [President Harry S.] Truman was a good candidate and that's when I was in college [University of Illinois in Champaign-Urbana].  As a result, I was interested in politics.  I attempted to -- I started off with the 4th ward, a young democratic organization, (background noise) but it wasn't very young, nor was it very democratic.  It was strictly an arm of the organization and I was disillusioned.  As I went to college, unfortunately you went to the university where they started preaching more reality or more theory of what the law should and ought to be, rather than the law as it is or as it exists or as it is practiced, so you tend to go out to the wild side of the law so to speak, and you became more or less enthusiastic about change.  There were a number of things that motivated me there.  One of the reasons I fell away from my religious beliefs -- I was born a Catholic and raised a Catholic, but one of the things that always riled me was the fact that we lived a block from Xavier College in high school.  My sister couldn't go because she was black at the time, and I just didn't understand these things and I refused to really accept some of the things the way they were and I didn't think-- as a result just like in college, people tend to fall away from their past practices, the things that were restrained and seek to find things new, and I did too.  So that's what happened there.  Politically, I became discouraged when I saw the young democrats, how they were operating and I -- Then when I went to [University of Chicago] Law School, you get more of a flare of the university and the university politics are always on the cutting edge so to speak.  In my practice, I became-- literally I started earning money and I was discouraged at politics because I disliked the way machine ran things, [William L.] Dawson, etc.  My first efforts to work with the 17th ward were rebuffed, because they had the so called club and the club consisted of the people that ran the organization.  They were the people who were the heirs of Dan Ryan and Dan Ryan was the man for whom the Dan Ryan is named.  He was one of the commissioners in Cook County.  He ran it as a fiefdom and of course, they had a black part which had no influence, had nothing to say about the real things in it and he would just get out and deliver the black vote.  I couldn't get along with it because of their positions on it.  It was that they ran it, it was their special club and they were going to keep it, because in politics, power concedes nothing.  As a result, they conceded nothing and nothing came from it and I didn't need it, because I wasn't a political worker and so I was very discouraged and I stayed away from it entirely until I moved into the 17th ward and Charlie Chew in 1963 wanted to run for alderman.
Story_ID: 45985
Speaker 1: When I started, Charlie Chew declared his candidacy for alderman, and I didn't like the way they treated us and so I went out and started to volunteer to work for Charlie and in fact, I had the highest precinct that he had, that he turned in.  One of the reasons for it is the black regulars who were defending the current incumbent white alderman were saying that he's a great democrat, he did that, this and the other, and so our thesis was yeah, I remember when they were throwing rocks at us when we first moved over here, he said nothing, his mouth was shut.  The people, because of the services and the treatment that they got, generally rejected him, but that became my introduction into politics.  One of the most fascinating parts about that is that Charlie Chew-- I had the best precinct that he turned out, which was some 300 to less than 100 for Charlie Chew, but on election date there was a precinct that was not manned and it was being run by the regulars of the organization, I mean the old time regulars, and it was a fascinating organization.  When I met them they said are you going to put up signs.  I said, "No problem, put your signs up anywhere you want to" and up and down the street as far as you could see were signs for Slight, the opposition candidate in all the yards, etc.  So there weren't too many places you could put up signs.  I said, "No, you talk to anybody you want to."  The family that ran this was a white family and it was an all black precinct, but she was like mother to them.  Their daughter and son both had fantastic jobs.  They had a black assistant and he had a pretty high paying job and they would pay everybody else, but the difference is they ran it like you would never, have never seen a district run.  People voted against Charlie in that precinct some 200 and some to 15.  All black precinct.  They did it for her, because she had -- When they came in, she always had a spread of lunch, dinner, whatever.  You just came in and ate, whoever you were, workers and everybody.  They took care of everybody, they had picnics for the kids, they knew everybody by name when they came in, she greeted everybody by name, she knew them, and it was clean as a whistle.  They didn't do anything wrong, they just knew everybody and because of the service that they had given these people -- They would get the kids jobs for the summer and although it was very lucrative for her family, because both her son-in-law and daughter had beautiful jobs, but you couldn't beat them, At 6:00, every sign on the street came down.  There were no signs hanging up anywhere and the ward wasn't cluttered, it was clean as a whistle.  It was amazing when I came out of there and saw the totals that Charlie got, I couldn't believe it.  I knew we had lost, but Charlie carried almost all the ward, all the precincts in the ward.  Charlie was one of the greatest campaigners that you have ever seen.  Of course, his theme song that made him sort of a real popular person was that -- He would call the mayor, that is the great last [Chicago Mayor] Richard M. Daley, everything but a child of God.  He was critical of the mayor and he was bombastic in his treatment of things, and he knew how to use and manipulate the press.  He was one of the greatest when it comes to using the press.  I think he still had a few tricks to show [HM] [Rev.] Jesse Jackson and Jesse Jackson is one of the great ones when it comes to using the press and promoting his particular programs or whatever it is.  Charlie did everything, he had the press come out and show him all the rats in the alley and to make sure they were there, he threw a couple down.  Then he invited them and pointed to the dead rats in the alley.  Charlie was a candidate, he was a person, I think best described as a rogue, but he was a lovable rogue.  Everybody loved Charlie.  In fact, even when we ran against Charlie one year -- I was an organization candidate supporting Russ (Tubow?).  We ran against Charlie and people would tell you, "I know Charlie's no good, but I like what he says, I like what he does."  You couldn't tell them anything about Charlie, they knew Charlie, but they said that's all right, and they accepted him.  He was a rogue, but he would mouth off their aspirations, hopes and then when he got elected, he turned and cut a deal with Daley and he's been a regular ever since.  Charlie would go with anyone.  He was a master politician.

Speaker 1: He had more gall than anybody that you've ever seen.  He would park in the governor's space down there and they'd say, "Governor, he's parked in your spot down there," and he'd say, "Look, if you put him out, he's going to get all the good publicity and I'm going to get all the bad publicity, let him stay there," and he would stay there.  Charlie had more gumption, more guts. He was a candidate like you've never seen before.  Charlie had a flare about him, because he dressed immaculately and he'd always wear expensive suits.  One of the fantastic stories about Charlie is that - He has a picture and it shows Charlie with a Rolls Royce.  Actually when Charlie first ran for alderman, he only had one car.  He had a black and tan and beige Rolls Royce, which he paid about $9,000 for at the time.  When he got elected alderman, he said, "Well I think I'm going to get a new Rolls Royce." And he went to the Rolls Royce people and the Rolls Royce that I happen to have a picture of there was one that they let him have and they said, "Try it out and see how you like it."  Charlie took the Rolls Royce, parked it in front of city hall, put his foot on the bumper, had his picture taken by Jet and it went all nation-wide, Rolls Royce Chew.  They called him up about three weeks later about the Rolls and he told them well, he didn't like the way it rode, they could come pick it up.  Charlie, from that day forward never really owned a car.  He had a staunch friendship with Leek Funeral Homes and Leek used to have the big sedans, one black and one white Cadillac and Charlie used to go over and borrow the Cadillac, put his license plates on it and drive to Springfield and everybody knew he had a big white Cadillac.  Then the next week he would borrow his black Cadillac and he would park that on the lawn and everybody thought Charlie had a black Cadillac.  And anyone that he knew that had a nice car, he would say, "Hey, I want to drive that car."  He would drive it to Springfield, put his license plates on it and everybody thought he had hundreds of cars literally.  The IRS people came to him one day in later years and they asked him, "Senator, we want to talk to you about these cars and you know, the things that you haven't declared."  He said, "What cars?"  They said, "Everybody knows you have these Rolls Royce's, et cetera, et cetera." and he said, "No."  He asked him, "He said young man, where did you get your information from?"  He said, "If I were you and you want to find out what I have, you go to the secretary of state and ask them what cars do I have."  In reality Charlie had one car.  He had a 1967 Chevy that somebody had given him and this was in the '70s, late '70s or '80s. They had given it to him. The only car he had in his name.  Everything else he would just borrow or say "Hey, I want to try it out," put his plates on it and go, park in the governor's spot or anybody else's spot. But he had a knack for flamboyancy. He was very flamboyant to the degree that he would bring his lady friends down to the Senate floor and let them sit in his seat.  Senator [William Russell] Arrington was a very straight laced gentleman and the president pro tem of the Senate from Evanston [Illinois] said, "Senator we are introducing our wives" and he would say "This is my fiancee," and every week he would proceed to have a different fiancee.  And he had--Charlie loved to attract crowds.  In later years, later years he had--the senate was in an uproar and one of the senators was pounding the desk and he was all upset about a bill and Charlie rose and said, "Young man," he said, "you shouldn't get excited about things like this and don't let these things get to you."  He said, "'Cause when I came here--" and Charlie Chew was an extremely dark skinned black American male, close to six feet tall, but he was very dark, immaculately dressed with glasses with the gold rim on it.  Bald head just like Michael Jordan, you know, bald head, one of the first ones, and he got up and he says, "Young man, don't let this stuff get to you."  He said, "When I got here, I was white and had hair," and of course, everybody in the audience would fall out laughing, you know because Charlie was extremely dark and very bald.  And but he had a flare for things that was unbelievable.  He was one of the unique people that you would meet there in Springfield [Illinois].

Speaker 1: So you really got your start with him [State Senator Charlie Chew]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Would you consider him your mentor in many ways, even though you said you ran against him.
Speaker 2: I fell out with Charlie when I ran for my first political office and I got a taste of machine politics.  They threw me off the ballot without even counting my signatures, but -- I formulated a friendship with Bill Shannon, who was my mentor then and Bill Shannon was a regular organization person.  He says come on in after the election and I'll show you the game of politics.  I came in.  I formulated a friendship and it so happened that after the election -- after the redistricting, there was a seat open in the House and the seat that was open at the time, you had three members, two democrats, one republican.  It was that type of situation.  One of the seats was open.  Although our ward had only a few precincts, and the other people who had more precincts were the 21st with [Joseph] Robichaux.  Robichaux had several candidates.  He had Bertran and Frost, [HM] Alderman [Wilson] Frost, who just retired as-- from politics.  He had too many candidates and in fact, he had several and he wouldn't make a choice. [Chicago] Mayor Daley at the time, [Richard] M. Daley, made the choice.  He said if the people could agree he made no effort to interfere, but if they couldn't agree and he knew that politicians could not agree, because they all have their individual greeds, he said bring it to me and I'll settle it.  So he picked me, although I didn't have very much of the district, simply because I had one of the best precincts that Charlie had before.  We had fallen out because Charlie had promised that he was going to go with me.  He went with somebody else.  Charlie had a knack for being a rogue who would never quite keep his word, but he was fantastic as a politician.  He could seize the moment.  He would make the best of anything, I don't care where it was.  He understood how to use the press and how to make the media his thing.
Speaker 1: Now, what made you interested in politics?
Speaker 2: Because of the mistreatment that we had and when Charlie said I'm going to stand up with it, I said I don't care, I'm going to stand with you, because I don't like the organization either.
Speaker 1: This is still the early 60's [1960s]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 45988
Speaker 1: Charlie Chew had convinced [Cook County Sheriff Richard J.] Elrod that he was one of the greatest politicians out and Elrod made him some high deputy in the sheriff's office and as a result he would give him a car, but Charlie wouldn't even let them put the sheriff's insignia on it.  He would drive it.  He would drive it to Springfield [Illinois] and he's drive it everywhere, but Charlie was so colorful.  He would say anything and do anything.  It was just unbelievable.  The state would allow some trips abroad for various investigations or things.  Charlie got a trip abroad, but the state would only pay for coach fare.  Charlie would ride up and get the sheriff's police to escort him with the sirens and flags whirring and his personal aide was a white gentleman that looked like he was syndicate connected and talked like it and he would be his lead man and he would start up, okay, make way for Senator Chew, and he would board the plane, gave the hostess his tickets and started walking to first class and she's say these are coach.  He said "I never ride coach" and would walk up and take a seat.  The hostess said oh yes Senator, we'll upgrade you right away and they would upgrade him and of course, he would never pay for it anyway.  That is a lead in story to show you the gall that he had.  When [First Lady] Ladybird Johnson was here conducting something at McCormick Place [Chicago, Illinois], Charlie Chew would stride in and he strode in on to the platform, came across where Ladybird was sitting and reached down and placed her with a great big kiss, and then Chew began to sit down in one of the seats and the people would say he's not supposed to -- The mayor said let him stay there, don't start any incident.  Charlie knew the things that he could do and he had no compunction about anything.  He was just amazing.  And he would- He had a certain strut to his walk and his demeanor and the way that he dealt with people and the way that he would deal with lobbyists.  He would tell the lobbyist to come over and pick up the check. He'd say, "Hey you, lobbyist, come here. Check over here." They would pick it up, "Okay Senator, Okay Senator." He would ask- he was so brazen and one of the most outstanding people that you've ever seen, but he knew politics, he understood it, he became one of Elrod's favorites and the mayor's favorites.  He had no compunction about saying or doing anything to his advantage, whatever it was.  He was somewhat amoral, but he was a rogue if there ever was one, but he was a lovable rogue.  Everybody loved him.  You had to love him.
Story_ID: 45989
Speaker 1: Okay.  So your mentor is [Bill] Shannon and you have this sort of falling out with him and you decide you're going to run right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: That's how it went. This was the 29th.
Speaker 2: District.
Speaker 1: What was your perception?  You know, a lot of times a lot of the heart of what was happening was in the city. But here is- you know, in Springfield [Illinois] What was the perception of wanting to be a part of that?
Speaker 2: Springfield was almost unknown, because everything in Chicago [Illinois] was the mayor [Mayor Richard J. Daley].  The mayor had accumulated all power unto himself.  He was chairman of the democratic party.  He used to dictate who the candidates would be in Springfield.  In fact, he had helped influence some elections even, and the mayor was all -- The mayor had his minions down and you really didn't have to think, all you had to do was follow the leadership, vote the way the leadership votes and that was it.  They would see that you got re-elected every time and it was not a problem.  In fact, among some of the candidates that I -- I would remind him of this -- was [HM] Roland Burris.  He first started out in politics running against me for one of the spots for state rep.  Of course, I beat him, because I had all the organization and all the troops and all the money and he was just a young pup coming in.  I reminded him of this when he was running for governor the one time and he would always laugh when we thought about it, but that's when he was a young man, had no experience, etc.
Speaker 1: You said Springfield -
Speaker 2: Springfield was a place where the mayor had his troops and his troops simply dictated.  They would determine what had to be done.  They have a very efficient method of organization.  The mayor would sit down, similar to the current mayor [Mayor Richard M. Daley] at his dinner table and they made decisions with certain members of the family and certain very influential people and they would meet the next morning very early with a certain small cadre of people to decide what they were going to say at the 8:00 meeting that's going to tell everybody else in the world including the press at the 9:00 meeting what's going to happen, but they were very efficient.  The mayor could at any time call out 45 votes and they would do right, left, middle, up, down or they would say jump and the question was how high on the way up.
Story_ID: 45990
Speaker 1: So you get elected and how--what was your--when you came down to Springfield [Illinois], what was the Springfield you anticipated and how did it differ from what you thought it was?
Speaker 2: Well I thought it would be--in Springfield, the House was a very lively body, because it encompassed people from all strains because of the two/one representation.  You would get minority representation.  That meant minority in terms of religion, minority in terms of ethnic background, minority in terms of finances, et cetera.  Up and down the line you would get different people elected and as a result there was more give and take.  It was a deliberative body.  You had to put together votes and you had to put together blocks, whereas the Senate was a little more rigid and frozen into formal lines, because they didn't run quite as often and basically certain seats were safe.  In other words, they were always Republication or always Democrat and there were only certain swing seats in the Senate.  So the House was very lively and it gave rise to a lot more debate and a lot more colorful action and it was something to see.  It was totally different than the [Chicago] City Hall where the mayor [Mayor Richard J. Daley] and his program would set it up and say this is the way it goes and everybody would say "Aye".  There you had to go out and work and get yourself a little group, a block, and work to get things done.
Story_ID: 45991
Speaker 1: Would you say that you were a good politician?
Speaker 2: At one time I was one of the little stars in the regular organization so to speak, because I was even spokesman for elections, which is very close to their heart, but I was not politically reliable.  By that I mean, the orders came down to vote "no" on a candidate without counting his votes, so I sort of choked and I couldn't do it.  So I wouldn't vote and so the thing just stayed tied.  That was a very unreliable thing to do if you're an organization person and I sort of went to the outside of the organization then.
Speaker 1: Was that early in your career?
Speaker 2: It was in the mid-career.
Speaker 1: What was that vote?
Speaker 2: That vote was on the seating of a Representative, as to who would win, who wouldn't.  They had cut a deal behind the scenes.  One candidate would get to stay in, the other one would go.  It was a compromise, and they didn't even count the votes.  I sort of choked on that one.
Story_ID: 45992
Speaker 1: At the time, I had a picture of the members of the House.  It was taken about '68 [1968].  They were very different and unique individuals.  On one end you had Genoa Washington, who was a Republican, got elected by a handful of votes, but very quiet gentleman, never hardly said anything.  There was Horace Gardner who was a Republican, hardly ever said anything, and Genoa Washington, Republican.  They were just Republican members in these districts.  They hardly ever had anything to say, they were strictly Republicans, but nevertheless, we found that we did have certain interests.  One of the first things we wanted to do was to formulate a caucus.  In fact, we formulated one of the first black caucuses.  The United States House of Representatives formulated a black caucus that was sort of patterned after the one we formulated.  When we formulated the caucus, Lewis Caldwell, who was one of the independent members, and we formulated between those that had some independence and those who were straight organization people.  When we formulated it, Lewis used to say, "Look, if we could just get you negros to just sit in a room and you don't have to do anything, you don't have to say anything, but don't come out fighting," and sure enough the press began to pick it up as a black caucus.  We had agreed on nothing, we could agree on nothing, but at least we got it over.  Lewis Caldwell was one of the real backbones to it.  In fact, Lewis Caldwell used to -- He was sort of a father figure.  He said, "Look, I don't want anything for myself, all I want to see is you guys get together and go somewhere and do some things."  Lewis was one of the people that used to take care of Harold [Washington], because Harold was a workaholic.  Harold Washington, our late mayor, was a true workaholic.  He was one of the brightest people in the [Illinois State] Assembly.  He was a workaholic, but Harold's social habits at the end, he liked to partake of the bourbon and Lewis would have to take care of him after a certain hour.  Lewis always saw that he got home and up the next morning, because Harold would be up at the crack of dawn, studying again, doing the particular things.  The rest of them were Democrats who broke down to the oldest senior Democrat who was Corneal Davis.  He had been there 32 years or 36 by the time he finished.  He finally got to be into leadership and I'll tell you about that story soon.  Anyway, the regular organization people -- You had such people as Jimmy Carter [James Y. Carter], who also held a job as city vehicle commissioner and you had Cecil Partee, who was one of the proteges of Campbell, who was the alderman and committeemen.  You had Senator [Fred] Smith, who was one of the oldest and longest term senators who served there.  In fact, he too held a political job.  You had Otis Collins, who was from the West Side, and he was about as independent as he could be under the circumstances, although most people would call him a handkerchief head by comparison.  There was McClendon from the -- No.  [Robert L.] Thompson.  I'm sorry.  There's Thompson whose place was taken by [HM] Jesse White.  Jesse White took the place of Thompson from the near north side.  Of course, there was Harold Washington, our illustrative mayor and Dick [Richard] Newhouse who was one of the real liberals and real fighters in the Senate.  There was Charlie Chew who was flamboyant from the word go.  You had Kenny Hall from East St. Louis who was really one of the reasons that we could get at a caucus, because Kenny did not belong to the Chicago organization and therefore, we didn't have to call it just a Chicago thing.  At first, I think the mayor frowned on it, because he didn't believe that we really had anything to talk about.  Tell us what to do, you don't have to talk about anything.  We thought we had interest and Lewis Caldwell was really one of the founders in that.  You had Ike [Isaac] Simms.  Ike Simms was from the West Side and Ike Simms was supported by the West Side block and Ike Simms used to run the policy wheels on the West Side.  He was very quiet, but an amazing person.  He was really tight with the west side block.  You had Jimmy [James] Taylor who came out of the 16th ward.  He came from the back of a garbage truck to becoming [Chicago Mayor] Jane Byrne's -- one of the staff people on Jane Byrne's staff, but his unfortunate circumstances were that Harold won that election and as a result Jimmy had to go, but at one time Jimmy was one of the most powerful politicians on the South Side.  He made judges and other people.  He had over 1,000 people in his organization.  He was one of the power houses.  There was Lewis Caldwell, who was an absolute independent and there was James McClendon who was from the old 4th ward, a real gentleman style if there ever was one.  There were 18 of us at the time and there were 13 in the House and 5 in the Senate.  There were three Republicans, which made our caucus a little more viable at the time, and there were 10 Democrats.
Story_ID: 45993
Speaker 1: The reason that the caucus was viable was that [Lewis] Caldwell was sort of independent, Harold [Washington] was independent, I was sort of prone to go that way.  I was crazy so to speak, politically unreliable if you will.  Otis [Collins] stayed to the best of his ability.  The others were basically organization people, because hey, that's where their butter came from, they knew where it was and they accepted it, and this was their thing.  From that, they were able to do things for their people, their organizations.  The others, we were not.  You could not do anything for anyone and that was the gist of it.  One of the thoughts that we had is we wanted to have a caucus or we wanted to have some rights to leadership and Harold, Lou and myself used to ride down and we would always plot that if the election became close enough we were going to formulate a block and not elect a speaker until he agreed to put Corneal [Davis] into leadership.  Corneal had been there longer than anyone else, but had no respect.  Like Rodney Dangerfield says, "Got no respect."  We were agreed that this was what we were going to do.
Story_ID: 45994
Speaker 1: There were 59 districts [in the Illinois General Assembly], yeah.  There were 177 at the time in the House.  Anyway, it so happened that the Senate was the one that was literally tied up at the particular time and it was due to the fact that [Richard] Newhouse decided that he would not vote unless they had a black pro tem and the fantastic part of the story is that in the House there were five black senators and they were Kenny Hall, Cecil Partee, Fred Smith and Dick Newhouse.  Everybody else was on board and Dick Newhouse told the president or the organization he wouldn't vote unless they had a black president, which was really a starting position for bargaining to see if we couldn't get some representation into leadership.  But the interesting part of the story was that took place about 1:00 and when they called [Chicago Mayor Richard J.] Daley and told him what did they want, they said, "He wants a black pro tem," and Daley said -- Daley told them at the time, because Daley was one of the brilliant politicians.  He was running against [State Senator William Russell] Arrington, who had been the pro tem for years.  Arrington was a protege of [W.] Clement Stone, who was fabulously wealthy and Arrington was wealthy on his own, plus he controlled the purses for all of the senators on the Republican side of the aisle.  The interesting part of the story is they scouted out Newhouse and Newhouse was offered $250,000 for the vote to vote for a Republican.  Newhouse told them he didn't want anything but a black pro tem.  Daley was a genius.  Daley knew that in the bidding -- You had to understand how money influenced votes.  They bought votes in that day and era in Springfield.  Daley knew that $250,000 was the opening as to where that vote would go, and he knew that by the time it got to a half million or maybe better, there were people in his own Democratic Party, plus many people from down in the democratic party in Southern Illinois who would say I'll take it and keep stepping.  They got their term, but nevertheless -- Daley knew that someone would give up and he sent orders down to make.  He said "Who do we have?"  They didn't want Charlie, because Charlie was too flamboyant.  Fred Smith was a little bit too old to understand the job.  Kenny Hall came from East St. Louis.  Dick Newhouse was the outsider, and Cecil Partee was the person.  Partee rode down with us that morning talking about how if he played his cards right, he could get to be a whip, which was one of the minor positions.  The mayor called and had all the Democrats change their vote and told them they had to vote for Cecil.  They called up all the people on the phone.  Those who were reluctant to go, he had their china men -- The china man refers to the person who sent you -- call them and tell them to vote for Cecil.  He knew that the only important thing in this game was to sink Arrington, who was literally the aircraft carrier of the enemy fleet.  He said, "You've got to stop Arrington, because if you leave it out there too long, somebody is going to sell," which is true.  The interesting thing is they made Cecil Partee.  Cecil would later assert that he knew it was going to occur, but he didn't.  To prove to the mayor that he was not a part of any click or plot with the rest of the caucus or Newhouse or any of the others, he had to punish Newhouse for about four years.  He denied him a seat as chairman on a committee and all of the other things simply to say hey no, I was not part of a plan, because many of the mayor's inner circle thought that Cecil, who was brilliant beyond belief, had engineered the whole project and they saw it as Cecil's doings.  They said that Cecil Partee has outfoxed us.
Story_ID: 45995
Speaker 1: Cecil [Partee] was one of the brightest and one of the best people down there.  He could work.  He had the ability like few that have ever come before him.  Cecil was absolutely brilliant in the spot.  Cecil was dedicated and he wanted to become -- Of course, everybody has ambitions and Cecil wanted to become eventually the first black U.S. Senator.  They convinced him to run for Attorney General where he lost and of course it's history from there.  The other sideline to that story is the Republicans picked the wrong person to go to when they offered the $250,000, because if they had offered it to [Charlie] Chew, and I'm quoting his words, not mine, he would have taken it.  He said [State Senator William Russell] Arrington would have been pro tem.  He said if they had offered it to Charlie, Charlie could do anything.  He would have justified that vote like you never seen anything else before.  After a certain point when it got to about $500,000, a number of people would have taken it.  The position was so important and it carried so much influence that you could literally have almost $1 million spent for it, just like the Senate and races of today. The amount of money that people spend is not related to the salary, it's the power and the influence that it has.  Charlie laughs and says "Damn sure would have."  Charlie knows.  He's up there in the great beyond, but he knows we're telling the truth on that.  That was actually how Cecil got to be the job, but Cecil was a genius at working it.  He was strictly a party man, loyal to it, but he knew how to line up the votes and he did the job super justification and one of the most brilliant people that you've ever seen.
Speaker 2: That's a wonderful story.  So you and that period of time, this group, which was a very disparate group, did come together.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: And that story, the story of Cecil Partee, that's interesting, because that's how he got in the Senate.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  [Richard] Newhouse actually made him, but he made it because [Mayor Richard J.] Daley understood the nature of politics and he said the main thing is to keep [State Senator William Russell] Arrington out.  It's got nothing to do with Cecil, it's keep Arrington out.  You must sink the enemy carrier.  Arrington was the carrier and they knew that the bidding opened at $250,000, but they knew that the bidding would go up and we got to about $1 million, at that time, you might be talking about $4 million, oh about 50 percent of the Senators would say "I'll take it."
Story_ID: 45996
Speaker 1: So what are the things that you're most proud of that occurred that you were responsible for?
Speaker 2: We led that and of course, after that we had a little trouble dealing with getting Corneal [Davis] into leadership into the particular position and Corneal was always with us.  Corneal was one of the true fighters for black rights down in Springfield [Illinois].  He never made a dime at anything.  He was dedicated to the cause of black people.  He was a minister and he was really dedicated.  Other people were dedicated to their careers, their future, their financial aspects, but Corneal was one of the people who was truly dedicated.  I would say that he and Lewis Caldwell, along with Cecil [Partee], were two of the most dedicated people that were there.  Harold [Washington] was just one of the brilliant minds of it and he came to the fore, but they were the people and it was -- I think the other thing that happened was we formulated the caucus, the caucus was able to precede this immediately.  We still have a black caucus and I was one of the first chairman of the black caucus that they had.  We're very proud of it, because we were able to put the interest of the people as a whole.  The other thing is we sort of bolted from the party and I think at that time it was [HM] Monica Faith Stewart, [HM] Carol Moseley Braun, Art and myself, who voted for the Republican map, because it gave blacks a better share of representation.  The Republican map gave the blacks solid districts and diluted the strength of the suburban districts so that the Republicans could control the suburban districts, but the Democratic map took many of the black democratic voters and overlapped a little into the suburbs so they could squeeze out Democratic votes, but nevertheless, that reduced the black majority.  [HM] Anthony Young was one of the people who sponsored one of the bills for the election of judges.  That was after our time.  Since that time, I lobbied for Harold in Springfield, and I also lobbied for the county board, for [HM] John Stroger up until a year and a half, two years ago.  It has been interesting, but the caucus, I think is one of the things and the -- We had a large number of successes.  We were always at least planning, plotting, but the difference was Lewis didn't have a job, I didn't have a job, Harold didn't have a job and that was basically the determining factor as to where people went, because when someone threatens your job, you generally concede.  I think one of the more interesting stories was when they had the election of Bill Redmond as Speaker of the House.  When Redmond was elected speaker of the house, Clyde Choate had gotten the nomination from the party the evening before and everybody pledged to Clyde Choate, because he was the democratic nominee.  There were Independent Democrats who were discontented with him, who would not vote for him, and you had to get a constitutional majority, which meant 50 percent plus one vote, and he couldn't get it and so we went for some 45 votes for Clyde Choate and Jerry [Gerald W.] Shea jumped up and announced he was for Bill Redmond and on the next vote 45 people switched because they belonged to the regular democratic organization and the independents were there. The interesting part of that is that Lewis Caldwell had put Herold Washington's name in the nomination, and he and Harold were voting for Harold, and there were a couple of other candidates who were voting, and the rest of us though were voting for Clyde Choate. Then, of course, Clyde then wouldn't withdraw, and of course I had taken the position that he ought to withdraw first, which was a very stupid position.

Speaker 1: What would you like your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: I don't know.  He lived, he laughed, he loved and he tried to make the world a little better place for those passing through.
Speaker 1: Why do you think politics is important for the African American community?
Speaker 2: Because it is singularly the most powerful force at work in the country.  Politics is the alpha force or it's the alpha dog in terms of relationships in the country.  It exceeds even money.
Speaker 1: And why should African Americans be interested in the work of the Illinois General Assembly?
Speaker 2: Because knowledge is important and the absence of knowledge creates a vacuum and if you leave a vacuum, people will use it to their own benefit, and not to yours.
Speaker 1: That's it.
