Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Unless you might say take time to smell the roses, that's pretty good.
Speaker 1: That sounds like a very good one.
Story_ID: 558976
Speaker 1: So next we'd like to talk--start with your family and so we're gonna start with your mom, would you please tell me about your mother and if you wouldn't mind starting out by saying her name and spelling it.
Speaker 2: Her name was Nettie, N-E-T-T-I-E, Johnson, J-O-H-N-S-O-N, Mays, my father's [Henry Mays] name.  Nettie Johnson Mays.
Speaker 1: And where was she born?
Speaker 2: She was born in Charleston, South Carolina, one of seven children.
Speaker 1: Do you know approximately what year she was born?
Speaker 2: Actually I don't remember.
Speaker 1: What do you know--has she ever told you any stories about her background or when she was growing up in South Carolina?
Speaker 2: You know we've lost so much of our history, we never even talked about things like that which I think is very sad that at that era of time we just didn't talk about things like that.
Speaker 1: And why do you think that you didn't have those kind of talks?
Speaker 2: Well I think maybe because her mother didn't talk much.  Her mother was very strict, very strict and very--I wouldn't say standoffish really but as a child when I was around her, I never felt like gee I've got a warm, fuzzy grandmother.
Speaker 1: Do you remember your grandmother's name?
Speaker 2: Her name was Emily Brewer Johnson [Emily Johnson].
Speaker 1: Was she also from South Carolina?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, yes.  She was very--I guess she considers herself one of the elite of Charleston, South Carolina.  She sang in the Pilgrim Congregational Church choir which made her very special and.
Speaker 1: What was so special about the Pilgrim Congregational Church [Charleston, South Carolina]?
Speaker 2: I don't really know what she thought but for her it was a big thing so I don't really know the--
Speaker 1: And is the Pilgrim Congregational Church, is that the church that your family attended?
Speaker 2: Oh that was in South Carolina, we never lived there.  I lived in New York [New York] all my life. My mother lived there (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Your mother, I'm sorry. Was that the church that your mother attended?
Speaker 2: I don't know, 'cause I only remember her from being in New York City so I have no real knowledge of the background.
Speaker 1: No sense of what was happening in South Carolina?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, we went to South Caro- my sister [Emily Mays] and I went to South Carolina once for Christmas (laughter) and it was strange.  You know my grandmother had this Christmas tree in the parlor and we were allowed two days, Christmas Day and one day after that to go into the parlor and see the tree, but you didn't go back into the parlor so Christmas was like ugh!
Speaker 1: So the parlor for your grandmother's home was a very formal room?
Speaker 2: A very formal room and only special guests sat in the parlor and of course as children we would not know how to behave in the parlor so we were not allowed to go into the parlor.
Speaker 1: And was that the case for the other people who lived near or who were associated with your grandmother?
Speaker 2: Oh we didn't associate (laughter) with the people, so it was very like a closed society I guess you would call it you know.
Speaker 1: And do you remember how old you were when you and your sister went to visit your grandmother (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I was in third grade because as we left to go to South Carolina I remember one of my classmates said, "Well you're going to South Carolina, but you're not gonna meet Santa Claus.  There's no such thing as Santa Claus anyway." So that was the--I, I remember that very well.
Story_ID: 558977
Speaker 1: Now what about your father?
Speaker 2: I know very little about him.  It's very interesting he--I know he had five brothers but I don't know the names of any of them, I don't know what happened to any of them.  I never saw any of them, it's like just a blank page in, in our family history.
Speaker 1: What was his name?
Speaker 2: His name was Henry Lucas Mays [Henry Mays].
Speaker 1: And would you mind spelling his?
Speaker 2: Henry, H-E-N-R-Y, Lucas, L-U-C-A-S, Mays, M-A-Y-S.
Speaker 1: And what--where was he from?
Speaker 2: Walterboro, South Carolina which is just outside of Charleston [South Carolina].
Speaker 1: Did you meet or spend any time with his family (unclear)?
Speaker 2: No. Unh-uh.
Speaker 1: And similar to your mother [Nettie Johnson Mays], did you not speak too much about his years as a youth?
Speaker 2: No, he would tell us, he told us once or twice about going hunting and he said that his mother was part Indian [Native American].  What tribe or anything, I don't know, but that's really all that we know about him.  It's interesting that we just never knew.  Now since 'Roots' ['Roots: The Saga of an American Family,' Alex Haley] people are doing genealogy, but now at that time it was just--these are your parents, these are the people who are with you right now and that's it, that's all you need to know.
Speaker 1: And you said that your father had a number of brothers but you didn't come into contact with them when you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Never saw any of them, know nothing about any of them.
Story_ID: 558978
Speaker 1: Once your, your parents moved to New York [New York] and you and your sister [Emily Mays]--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --were born you basically stayed in New York?
Speaker 2: In New York City, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Except for perhaps this one trip that you took for Christmas to your maternal grandmother's [Emily Johnson] house (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Went--when we went to (unclear), yes. Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Wow, so what's your earliest memory of growing up?
Speaker 2: I thought we were very lucky kids, I didn't realize that we were supposed to be poor until I was taking a course in college and they were talking about these deprived children and they were giving you geographically where these deprived children lived, which happened to be you know in Harlem [New York, New York] where I lived and I'm saying, oh, I was?  (Laughter) We didn't know it because--maybe it was welfare money they sent.  We went to--my sister and I sent to camp for two weeks every summer.  We went to church where we had chamber music quartets who came and played on Sunday afternoons.  My mother [Nettie Johnson Mays] paid, I think it was twenty-five cents a lesson for us to take piano lessons.  So, I--maybe we were poor but I didn't know it.
Speaker 1: Did you--was your mother at home during your childhood?
Speaker 2: She worked as a domestic, but you know at that time your mother was home or out, but there were the aunts and the other aunts and the cousins, so you were never alone.  It was at that time when somebody could say, "Well you know I saw her do that down the street," and you were punished because that person saw it and you couldn't defend yourself, you just did it.
Speaker 1: So during most of the days were you spending that time with an aunt who was?
Speaker 2: Whoever was home when you got out of school.
Speaker 1: And who else did you live with who would be available to be home perhaps when you and your sister got out of school?
Speaker 2: We had an aunt who lived downstairs, and a cousin who lived across the hall.  We lived in an apartment house so we had, we had relatives and then the neighbors knew you too.  You were just--was right--well that village that raises kids, and we had that village.
Speaker 1: And so did your entire--did your mother and her cousin and her sister--did they move from South Carolina all together?  How did your--
Speaker 2: I don't know how they got there, we just--as we grew up they were there, they were just there.
Story_ID: 558979
Speaker 1: And what did your father [Henry Mays] do when you were growing up (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) He was a chef, he was a chef.
Speaker 1: Where was he practicing?
Speaker 2: He worked sometimes on a boat, I think one of the Hudson River Day Line boats, he--one time he did that, then he worked in I guess it was called a lunch--like a luncheonette in a drugstore and that's what I remember about that.
Speaker 1: So how much time did you get to spend with your parents say throughout a week or, how did that work?
Speaker 2: Well when they came--we were home when they came home from work or then my mother [Nettie Johnson Mays] would come home maybe about a half hour or so after we got out of school.  It was never like we were latchkey kids in the house for hours or anything like that.  My father came home about six o'clock in the evening and we had--we always ate dinner together.  We sat to the table and had dinner together so that was, that was how that was.
Speaker 1: Was dinner something that you and your sister [Emily Mays] prepared or does your mother always prepare dinner? How'd that go (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) (Laughter) No, my mother prepared, I called her a survival cook, she wasn't a great cook but she prepared what we had to eat.  I think that's why I don't eat beans now, we had a lot of beans 'cause you know they lasted a long time or--stuff like that.  My father was very good with desserts.  I don't think my mother ever made a cake in her whole life.  If she did I don't remember, probably wasn't something that we could eat if she did make it (laughter).
Speaker 1: And did your father at any point do any cooking inside the house?
Speaker 2: Just desserts, just desserts.
Speaker 1: And was he focused on desserts on the boat and when he worked (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, full meals on--
Speaker 1: --at the luncheonette? He did everything?
Speaker 2: Full meals on the--when he cooked out, but mother was the cook for home.
Story_ID: 558980
Speaker 1: So how would you describe your family life?
Speaker 2: I thought it was great.  Well I remember when I was very small before I could read my father [Henry Mays] used to come home from work and they had what they call--you know what a Morris chair is?  Probably not, but a great big arm chair and they called it a Morris chair, and he'd bring a Herald Tribune [New York Herald Tribune] and we'd sit in--he'd sit in the chair and my sister [Emily Mays] and I would sit on his lap and he read to us from the--not Br'er Rabbit what is it, the rabbit stories, Burgess--aw what's this guy's name?  Felton Burgess [sic. Thornton W. Burgess], anyway the bunny rabbit stories that were in the Harold Tribune.  I can remember him reading to us every evening the, the stories of the rabbit and the fox and all those things in the paper every day.
Story_ID: 558981
Speaker 1: What about holidays, how were those spent?
Speaker 2: Seemingly very quiet--once--I guess that was during the time when there was little or no money because we didn't get a lot of things for Christmas.  We got--from Sunday school, we got a box of candy and we got a stocking that had a piece of fruit and some nuts and maybe a toy.  I really don't remember Christmas gifts.  I guess it wasn't a thing that we had--going Christmas shopping was not something (laughter) that we did.
Speaker 1: Did you eat large on holidays?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we had a big dinner.  I remember one time (laughter)--this is when my sister [Emily Mays]--we were kind of grown up then maybe not quite teenage, but growing up and my father [Henry Mays] loved rice.  Well you know South Carolina people eat rice, so those particular meal we had sweet potatoes, I don't eat sweet potatoes so we had white potatoes, we had baked macaroni and my father said--he called all of us bum--, "Bum, where's the rice? I need a filler for my dinner."  I mean you had all these other things but he had to have his filler for his dinner, but that was--but the meals were big meals at the holiday time.
Speaker 1: And did you spend the holiday time with the other relatives that perhaps lived nearby?
Speaker 2: Oh sometimes they took turns where you had dinner.  Eat at our house one time and you go to Aunt Susie's [Susan Johnson] house one time, go to my Aunt Lottie's [Lottie Johnson] house one time.
Speaker 1: What were the most important holidays?
Speaker 2: Well Christmas was the only one that I remember being a really big holiday.  Easter I remember because we got a new dress for Easter and we hoped that the weather would be warm enough for you to wear it (laughter), and sometimes in the city [New York, New York] it was and sometimes it was not but that was the, that was the thing for Easter.  Easter egg hunts and things like that we didn't have, it was just a new dress.
Story_ID: 558982
Speaker 1: If you could describe for me--if you needed to describe to someone else what--how would you describe your mother [Nettie Johnson Mays]?
Speaker 2: She was a very interesting, very bright, very wise woman.  She went to--was it I think--ninth grade in academic school but she had the wisdom of the sages in terms of who you were, what you were supposed to do, how you were supposed to do things.  She, she got right or wrong into your head, and she didn't spank you.  She could look at and she spoke volumes, very bright woman.
Speaker 1: And what kind of things did your mother require so when she's shooting you that glance?
Speaker 2: (Makes sound).
Speaker 1: What kind of skills and (laughter) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Straighten up (laughter), straighten up, get your act together.  You're not being polite, you're not speaking properly, your homework is not neat.  She didn't know what we were doing but she'd look at it and say, "Do that over."  And I'm saying, "It's done."  "It's not done, do it over." And you did it over.  She didn't know what it was supposed to be but she knew how it was supposed to look.  She'd know how you were supposed to speak to people and she would say even if you didn't care about a person, you said good morning, or good afternoon or good evening. It's manners.
Story_ID: 558983
Speaker 1: And like I said she [Smith's mother, Nettie Johnson Mays] found the money to send us to--I went to elocution school, you know what that is?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: I went to elocution school with Madam C.J. Riley [ph.] (laughter) and she was so funny, but we learned there.  We learned--that's where we learned the difference between what we call now black English and standard English because we learned Paul Laurence Dunbar and we learned Paul Laurence Dunbar as a standard English poet.  Mother saw that we got those kind of things.
Speaker 2: So when did you go to--can you just repeat who you went to elocution school with and just tell us a little bit about the history of that with yourself and your sister [Emily Mays]?
Speaker 1: Her name was Madam C.J. Riley and she use to give programs around in Harlem [New York, New York] as a elocutionist and my mother--I don't know how my mother found her, but she found her and on Saturdays, not every Saturday, I think it was every other Saturday we went to Madam C.J. Riley's elocution school where we learned to recite, we learned to read, we learned how to read the scripture with feeling (laughter), you couldn't just read you read with feeling, with proper enunciation and every once in a while we'd put on a play.  My sister hated it. Oh she detested it.  She was very shy 'cause she never wanted to get up in front of anybody and do anything.  But one time we had a little skit we were doing and she said, "Now this skit--." Madam Riley said, "This skit takes place in the forest."  My sister said, "I'll be tree, I'll stand there, I'll be a tree," (laughter), oh, she was the tree and that was, that was--we had a lot of fun and that was our--the beginning of my love for poetry and literature and stuff like that, one of my beginnings in that field.
Story_ID: 558984
Speaker 1: Let's talk a little bit about your sister?   What's her name?
Speaker 2: Her name was Emily Cynthia Mays.
Speaker 1: And where is she in relationship to and your age (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) She was two and a--two years older than I am.
Speaker 1: And so you all did most things together?  Did you attend most schools together?
Speaker 2: We went--well she was ahead of me in school.  We went to the same school until we went to high school and I said to my mother [Nettie Johnson Mays], "I do not want to go to the school where my sister is going.  I am tired of being Emily Mays' sister; I want to be my own self."  So, she went to Evander Childs High School [Evander Childs Educational Campus, Bronx, New York] and I really wanted to go there because they had a pool.  She couldn't care less about having a (laughter) pool.  She got a doctor's note saying she couldn't go swimming because it was bad for her health.  But she went to Evander Childs because they had--and I went to Morris High School [Bronx, New York] because they didn't have a pool but I didn't want to go where my sister went to high school.
Speaker 1: To the same place.
Story_ID: 558985
Speaker 1: So in the same way that I asked about your mom [Nettie Johnson Mays], could you describe your father [Henry Mays]?
Speaker 2: My father was very quiet, very laid back and he never took charge of anything.  If my mother said, "No," that was it, you just, you didn't even go think well maybe I can twist him, maybe he'll get--no, no, no. If my mother said no, that was it.  The only time he ever disciplined--and I don't think he ever disciplined my sister [Emily Mays].  He disciplined me once because I threw scissors at my sister and he didn't think that was a nice thing to do (laughter).  I didn't either but I mean at that time she made me mad.  I didn't throw it at her head or anything just at her leg you know, no harm done (laughter).
Story_ID: 558986
Speaker 1: What street did you live on?
Speaker 2: We were born on 137th Street and 5th Avenue.  I told my mother [Nettie Johnson Mays], "Two more buildings and we would've been born in the East River," (laughter), 'cause we, we were in the last two houses on the block.
Speaker 1: Can--so can you describe your block a little bit?  I know where it is but--
Speaker 2: You know (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) perhaps for some who hasn't been to the city [New York, New York].
Speaker 2: Well I don't know what it looks like now but we lived in a tenement house you know with the apartments that run back and forth and I remember a lady named Mama Katie [ph.] who sat on the stoop all the time and watched us when we were playing.  So she watched us for safety I would imagine and she watched us for how we behaved, and then on the ground floor lived Ms. Voucher [ph.].  My family I think was the only family that came from the South, both the other people came from the islands so I thought, I thought everybody who from any island had to be West Indian.  I mean that was the only island I knew.  Ms. Voucher use to cook pigs' feet and potato salad every Saturday and we'd buy a little--enough for dinner for a quarter and that was our Saturday meal, and I still love pigs' feet and potato salad (laughter).  We have it in our house every once and a while even now.
Story_ID: 558987
Speaker 1: So what sights and sounds and smells remind you of your child- your childhood?
Speaker 2: Well, on Sunday mornings we would walk to church 'cause we were living on 137th Street, church was 139th Street.
Speaker 1: What church was it?
Speaker 2: Grace Congregational Church [Grace Congregational Church of Harlem; Grace Congregational Church of Harlem United Church of Christ, New York, New York] which we still attend, and we'd walk to the church but on the way my father [Henry Mays] was sexton at the church so we had to go early.  We'd walk to church and on the way we'd stop, there was a bakery on 8th Avenue [Frederick Douglass Boulevard] between 138th and 139th Street.  It was owned by a German person and we would stop there and we'd have breakfast, that was our treat on Sunday morning and I could remember eating grits, sausage and one egg over light.  I still eat one egg over light, and sometimes if there was extra money we might get a piece of Danish pastry.  Now that was--and then when we got to church it was first Sunday at the communion.  My sister [Emily Mays] and I would go in the back 'cause daddy was a sexton and he had to clean up.  We drank all the rest of the wine or the grape--whatever was left we'd, we cleaned it up and that was fun.
Speaker 1: And what about coffee beans I have to ask about?
Speaker 2: Oh, there was a grocery store across the street from us.  At that time it was an A&P [The Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Company] and mother [Nettie Johnson Mays] would give us money to go across the street and tell Mr. Bill that we wanted one pound of Red Circle Coffee ground fresh, and he would let us pour the coffee in the thing and grind it up and see all the ground up beans come out and we'd pack it in a little bag.  Oh, and it smells so good.  Coffee has never tasted to me as good as it smells when it's cooking but that was wonderful, and we went--I think about once a week we bought this--my Aunt Susie [Susan Johnson], my mother's sister Aunt Susie had a little more money than we did it seemed like and she used to buy--she didn't buy the Red Circle, she bought the next brand up, but she got hers ground fresh too (laughter) and made that distinct difference between the haves and the have nots (laughter), but that was, that was fun.
Speaker 1: So we've got--any sights that you see now? Anything that you've run into that reminds you of growing up?  We're kind of intersecting with the bakery and the flavors, we got some smells, so maybe sights and sounds?
Speaker 2: Well I know a sound that we heard, you know the Elks [Improved Benevolent and Protective Order of the Elks of the World] used to--when anybody died they had that parade.  We'd move 'em from 137th Street, we were living on 7th Avenue [Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevard] then this time.
Speaker 1: 7th Avenue and which?
Speaker 2: At 133rd Street and when the Elks had their funeral, and you'd look out, we could look out the window and you'd hear them with boom, boom, ba-boom, boom, ba-boom, ba-boom, ba-boom and they'd go up there and we'd just look out the window and we'd say, "Oh poor person, somebody died" (laughter).  We don't who died but it was (laughter) and we'd look out the window and watch 'em.  They had their little aprons turned with the black side out and we could see all that--was, we could watch 'em going up the avenues playing that very solemn sound.  That was one of the things I remember very well.
Story_ID: 558988
Speaker 1: Did you and your sister [Emily Mays] have chores or responsibilities around the house?
Speaker 2: Sort of, you know we had to--I guess we had to clean the bathroom when you took turns and we'd take turns washing the dishes after meals.  I don't think we were very strict about housekeeping or anything.
Speaker 1: And what about church, you said you attended a church about a block away?
Speaker 2: At Grace Congregational Church [Grace Congregational Church of Harlem; Grace Congregational Church of Harlem United Church of Christ, New York, New York], we went there.
Speaker 1: Grace Congregational. How--did you go every week?
Speaker 2: Every week.
Speaker 1: Did you go more than once a week?
Speaker 2: Only if they had special programs.  I don't think we had a youth program there at that time.  So we went to Sunday school, then we went to church service and I remember I just--my sister joined the church when she was twelve and when she joined the church the pastor who took 'em, took them in gave everybody a brand new quarter and I'm sitting there and I'm saying, "She got a brand new quarter for joining the church."  I ran up--, "I'm ready to join the church too," so I could get--and he let me do it so I got my brand new quarter when I was--but that's how I joined the church.
Speaker 1: You were ten?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, and I, I wanted my quarter.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Beyond your quarter were you active in the church?
Speaker 2: We had to be, I don't think we had to be because we didn't want to be, but we had to be because it was just great.  We went there we had a good Sunday school.  We had good Sunday school teachers.  We did interesting things and we sang a lot and they took us little trips and things like that.  So we grew from going to Sunday school to becoming Sunday school teachers and.
Speaker 1: And did any of your interest in, in storytelling and in stories generally, was that developed at all while you were in Sunday school?
Speaker 2: No, I always, I think I always liked to listen to stories.  I think I liked to listen to people read to me but storytelling as such was not a part of those early, early days.
Story_ID: 558989
Speaker 1: What elementary school did you attend?
Speaker 2: I went across the street to P.S., what was it?  P.S. 139 [New York, New York], no we went to P.S. 139 to kindergarten, and I went to P.S. 81 [Julia Ward Howe Junior High School 81, New York, New York] from third grade through ninth grade.  Ninth grade you graduated and went to high school.
Speaker 1: So during your elementary school years did you have any teachers who influenced you particularly?
Speaker 2: I had a teacher who loved to read to us.  Her name was Ms. Douglas [ph.] and she loved to read to us and she read--I don't know what she read, but she read to us and I think that was the important thing that she read to us and I, I got to like to hear people reading to me.
Speaker 1: What did you like about it?  You said earlier that your father [Henry Mays] would read you all the paper?
Speaker 2: Just hearing words, hearing stories and sometimes they were funny and you'd laugh and even with Ms. Riley [ph.] she--when she did the poetry some of the poems were sad and we--you know we got the emotions and stuff out, it was--I think literature has always been just a part of what, what I knew about or was a part of.
Speaker 1: So what kind of student were you in elementary school?
Speaker 2: Except for math (laughter) I was pretty good.  I was, I was very bad--I'm still not good in math.  My checkbook has not balanced since I think about the first year.  I look and I get my bank statement and I say, "Oh, the bank has more money than my book has, good," and that's--and I'm happy, I don't worry about it.  I've been treasurer of organizations and I kept their money penny, by penny, by penny, but for me you know as long as I got more than--the bank says I have more than I thought I had, I'm, I'm fine, but the spelling and the writing, the literature and penmanship, good.
Speaker 1: And what about your behavior, I mean what kind of a student were you?
Speaker 2: Oh, most of the time I was pretty good (laughter), and one day I can remember, I don't know what grade I was in and I said, you know everybody has a fight in the afternoon.  I've never had one (laughter), I think, I think I wanna have a fight.  So I went up to this kid and I pulled her hair and I said, "You wanna fight?" (Laughter) So we went downstairs in the street and we had a little fight.  I was punished for fighting 'cause I mean you know you don't fight in the house across the street, the school across the street from where you live without somebody letting you know, and your mother know and your aunts know and everybody knows that you had a fight, but we had a fight and then we became friends after that, but other than that I was a pretty good kid.
Speaker 1: So you weren't really a fighter?
Speaker 2: No, I didn't want to fight but I just said everybody else--
Speaker 1: You dabbled a bit?
Speaker 2: --had done it, so (laughter) I had to do it at least one time.

Speaker 1: Well you mentioned the subjects that you liked. Did you have any particular dreams or aspirations while you were in elementary school [Julia Ward Howe Junior High School 81, New York, New York]?  Did you have any idea where you were headed?
Speaker 2: Not, not really, I think maybe way, way in the back of my head I knew what I wanted to be which is not what I turned out to be.
Speaker 1: What did you want?
Speaker 2: I wanted to teach Latin, I wanted to teach Latin.  My mother [Nettie Johnson Mays] had--once again this mother of mine with the smarts had gotten some young women who were taking Latin in school to come to the house on Saturdays and--it's another quarter.  I don't know you know these--there was a little of change of money but I don't know where the money came from but I got these Latin lessons and I just loved--I still love Latin.
Speaker 1: And what's so important about Latin?
Speaker 2: To me it's the basis of English, it's the basis of English.  You can read a book and you come across a word.  At first you don't have any idea what it is but then you know, oh this is that Latin root and this is that Latin root and this is that and the word makes sense.
Story_ID: 558991
Speaker 1: I just wanna ask you before we move on to junior high school [Julia Ward Howe Junior High School 81, New York, New York], you've indicated now that your mother [Nettie Johnson Mays] sent you to elocution school and to Latin school and you did express that--
Speaker 2: And we had piano lessons.
Speaker 1: Please tell us a little bit more about her ingenuity (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) (Laughter) My piano lessons I remember we were taught by Cousin Hugo [ph.].  I mean--I don't know how, when I say cousin I'm not sure he was in the family but anyway Cousin Hugo and we went--my sister [Emily Mays] was very good.  I was--I had to go (laughter) and Cousin Hugo had a yellow pencil and if you didn't keep your rhythm right he'd crack your knuckles with a yellow pencil and I told my mother, "I don't wanna go to Cousin Hugo anymore because he cracks my knuckles with a yellow pencil."  She said, "Learn the rhythms and you will not have your knuckles cracked."  So, she didn't baby you, if you were sick you knew that you were really not feeling good 'cause she'd call you honeybunch, other than it was by your name and do what you were told to do and any grown folks said you did something wrong you were in trouble, you--a very wise woman, I mean just, just a very wise, wise person.  I don't know if she could have gone on to--I don't know what she would've been could she had gone on to school.  I don't know but she was very, very wise.  I have not--I've many--met other people who had the education level that she had who were as wise as she was.
Speaker 1: And you said that you did not know a lot about her growing up?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Do you have any theories on where your mother got her savvy?
Speaker 2: I don't because I had one--my Aunt Susan [Susan Johnson], the one I told you that I think had the money, my Aunt Susie went to a girls school in South Carolina and she had formal training.  I don't know what the other family members had.  Her brother, my--her youngest brother Uncle Henry [Henry Johnson] got something from somewhere because he was very classical oriented.  He was the one that went to the opera and played musical instruments that--'cause I think there must've been a seed of smartness in, in the family, that's, that's how I, how I can, I can put it, but she was, she was wise and she taught us about being important--how important it was to be who you are, not to worry who is somebody else, what they had or what they could do.  You are who you are and you better do what you know you can do and do it right.
Speaker 1: How did she show you that?
Speaker 2: Because she didn't tolerate any less than, less than that.  I mean like what I said with the lessons, she didn't know what we were doing but she knew how it should've been done.  You could not come home to her and say, "Well you know the teacher didn't like--."  No, "The teacher's not supposed to like you.  The teacher is there to teach you and you are there to learn.  She doesn't have to like you.  Is she teaching the other kids in the class?"  "Yes ma'am."  "Okay, you learn" (laughter) and that, that was it.
Story_ID: 558992
Speaker 1: You indicated earlier that the public school [Julia Ward Howe Junior High School 81, New York, New York] that you attended across the street was almost from kindergarten to ninth grade?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So where did you attend high school and where was that located?
Speaker 2: When we left, when we finished ninth grade there was a thing in New York [New York]--you know we did--we never talked about segregation in New York as a word, but we knew it was there and they wanted the black kids to go to Wadleigh High School [Wadleigh High School for Girls; Wadleigh Secondary School for the Performing and Visual Arts] which was basically a black school in Harlem [New York, New York] or downtown somewhere, I don't know exactly where it was.  My mother [Nettie Johnson Mays] said we were gonna go to Morris High School which is in the Bronx [New York], 99 percent Jewish clientele and that's where we went, and I don't know how come we were able to do it because we didn't change our address or anything, we were living on 7th Avenue [Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevard], 133rd Street which was out of the Morris High School district, but she got us in there and everything went well until my senior year and it was two terms.  The first term of senior year and the second term of senior year the guidance counselor called us, two of us in the office and said, "You're ready to graduate now, we think that you ought to go to Wadleigh High School and finish your senior year so that you can graduate with your own people."  My mother said, "I don't think so," and she called in the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People].  See again there again are those smarts, she called in the NAACP and the NAACP, some representative had a meeting with the guidance counselor and whoever else the powers that be at Morris High and they said, "How is the discipline?"  "No problem."  "How is the attendance?"  "No problem."  "How are the academics?"  "No problem."  "Then they will graduate from Morris High School," and that was it.  And she, she said, "No, then you're--then you're not gonna transfer her.  She doesn't know those people at Wadleigh."
Speaker 1: You indicated earlier that your sister [Emily Mays] attended a different high school from you?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Did you, did she eventually come to Morris with you?
Speaker 2: No she graduated from Evander Childs [Evander Childs High School; Evander Childs Educational Campus, Bronx, New York] with no problem.
Speaker 1: And was that in--within the same district as you lived (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No that was way--where is it--up Dikeman Street [sic.] you know way up in the Bronx on the west, West Bronx. Um-hm, but she didn't have the problem.
Speaker 1: So during your high school years, did you have any particular teachers who influenced you?
Speaker 2: I don't know whether it was the teacher or whether it was the subject matter, but I took Latin through several years in high school, and I think that's because I decided I was gonna--I wanted to teach Latin. And I remember I had a man teacher, I think it was a social studies teacher and he use to take us to the Yankee [New York Yankees] ballgames every once in a while.  If you came to class you could almost be assured of an A on that particular day if you know if the Yankees won or lost the day before but that was, that was part of their thing.
Speaker 1: And what kind of a high school student were you, similarly, you know, what was your behavior like?  Did you have?
Speaker 2: I was, I was pretty quiet in high school, I guess--I don't think I was intimidated by--but I was impressed by the seemingly endless abilities of those Jewish kids to learn everything, and I kept saying, well I guess I can learn part of what they're, they're doing.  I remember, I can remember this boy, I don't know his name but a tall, blonde fellow and he began--gave a lecture on the robber barons, which had to do with economics at that time, and I'm saying, where does he know this stuff?  Where did he learn this?  And I tried to read more and catch up to keep up with them.  I worked on the school newspaper and learned how to write editorials and things like that which was a good exercise too.
Speaker 1: Do you remember any of the editorials that you--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --composed?
Speaker 2: No, I remember writing a piece for the yearbook though on suicide (laughter), the young woman who was editor said, "Well why are you writing about suicide?"  I said, "Because at this age everybody thinks about it."  She said, "They do?"  I said, "Yes." But she didn't want to publish it, so.  I don't think I was gonna commit suicide, I never thought about that but to write about it sounded pretty good.
Speaker 1: So you worked on the newspaper, on the yearbook; did you participate in any other activities during your--
Speaker 2: Not, not really (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) Morris High School years?
Story_ID: 558993
Speaker 1: And once you became a senior [at Morris High School, Bronx, New York] did you have any idea how you were going to approach your later education?
Speaker 2: We had no choice, we were poor kids right?  We had no money.  Hunter College [New York, New York] was the city girls school, NYU [New York University, New York, New York], no, and--not NYU, yeah NYU was a boys school.  We had to go to Hunter because we had no money.  I think it cost two dollars to register, two dollars for library fee, and I think when we graduated we paid two dollars for the graduation fee, but the thing was you had to keep your average.  If you wanted to stay that you couldn't get anything lower than a B average.  If you got lower than a B average you went to night school.  If you didn't keep up a C average at night school you were out, and they didn't say, well, poor little black child, she didn't have all these advantages therefore.  No, you came here to Hunter, these are our standards you will--they told us the first day we went they said, "You are now Hunter College women.  You will have no social life, you are here to study and to learn."  They put the fear of god in you (laughter) on the first day, and, and you did it.  And I was still at that time determined that I was going to be a Latin teacher.
Speaker 1: So was your major at Hunter College Latin?
Speaker 2: It was English and Latin at that time, and I took a college--an education class, preparation for teaching.  It was so dull, it was so uninspiring, it was so boring and I said, if that's what teaching is, I'm outta here, and I went right downstairs and changed my major.  I kept the English and I took a minor in history and the poor little Latin just went by the board.  So I graduated from Hunter with a major in English and a minor in history, and people thought, well you have a minor in physical education too?  Because in between times I took fencing, and badminton and basketball and volleyball and, but I had time to, to do that, but college was fun.
Story_ID: 558994
Speaker 1: Who else attended Hunter College [New York, New York] with you?  I'm under the impression that [HistoryMaker] Ruby Dee was there at about the same time.
Speaker 2: Yes, (laughter), Ruby Dee was, Ruby Dee wasn't Ruby Dee at that time you know she was just another--but at that ti- she was married [to Frank Dee Brown]--remember the little guy who use to (singing) "Call for Philip Morris," remember him?
Speaker 1: I don't, but.
Speaker 2: He was a little midget and he was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) He was in advertisement?
Speaker 2: Um-hm and married him, that's how we got to (laughter)--Ruby Dee was not Ruby Dee to us, she was just you know somebody who married a midget and one time years later, well not years later, she went to make a lecture down at Florida A and M [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical College for Negroes; Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida], and I was working down there, that was after we got out of college and she put into the papers down there that the people--she was one of the most studious people at Hunter College and the other people there played cards in the cafeteria all the time.  So I just crossed her off my list, I have never been able to really, really look at Ruby Dee as this wonderful actress that she was because she bad mouthed us and we were at Hunter College struggling just like she was to get our lessons done, so.
Speaker 1: And did anyone attend with you who's also of note or who was later important in your work?  Were any of those people at Hunter College with you?
Speaker 2: Not that I can remember, not that I can remember.  They probably all did what I did you know get out and get our job, do your job and just--'cause I don't even know why I'm here for this, but anyway that's another story (laughter).
Story_ID: 558995
Speaker 1: What did you do once you graduated Hunter [Hunter College, New York, New York] with your English and history minor?
Speaker 2: I went to library school [Columbia University, New York, New York].  I had--when I changed my major I was talking to Dorothy Homer who was the branch librarian at 135th Street Library [Countee Cullen Library, New York, New York], and I was moaning and groaning like, "I don't wanna teach, I can't--I'm just educated and I'm just--," you know whining and carrying on like a--and she said, "Well you know, you love libraries, you love books.  I see you in here all the time why don't you try and see if you might like to be a librarian."  So she put me--not on the payroll but as a regular volunteer and she taught me work ethics that you wouldn't believe.  She said, "Okay, you're supposed to be on the desk at six o'clock, it doesn't mean that you come in here at six, you come in here ten minutes to six, get your materials ready, you're on the desk at six o'clock, you leave at nine.  You don't leave a quarter to nine, you don't start packing your things up at five minutes to nine, you leave at nine o'clock.  When you answer the telephone you speak, 'This is 135th Street Library, may I help you?'  Telephone courtesy, if somebody came into the library asking for something you don't point and say, 'There it is over there,' you show them."  I mean it was this beginning of how to be and (laughter)--when you worked on the books, she said, "Neatness even in placing a pocket in a book."  Those kind of things that have stood the test of time.
Speaker 1: Will you repeat her name for us so that--
Speaker 2: Dorothy Homer. H-O- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Dorothy Homer.
Speaker 2: H-O-M-E-R.
Story_ID: 558996
Speaker 1: And can you tell us a little bit about your visiting to the 135th Street branch [135th Street Library; Countee Cullen Library] of the library in New York [New York]?  How did you start, when did you start doing that?
Speaker 2: They use to take us there from school [Julia Ward Howe Junior High School 81, New York, New York].
Speaker 1: From Hunter [Hunter College, New York, New York]?
Speaker 2: No, when we were little we use to go there from school and then because we lived practically around the corner from it when I lived on 133rd Street that was my branch library, so I had a library card there.
Speaker 1: So once you were in college you were still--
Speaker 2: Living at 133rd Street (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And visiting the library?
Speaker 2: So I still went to use that library.
Speaker 1: And what kind of materials do you remember most about the 135th Street Library? This is obviously a long time span, but.
Speaker 2: Well they had a very good biography section and they had a very good poetry section so that was where I read a lot and I read a lot of novels too.  I think I read everything that Frank Yerby wrote, and nobody knew about Frank Yerby, but I read a lot of Frank Yerby along the way.
Story_ID: 558997
Speaker 1: So you attended Columbia [Columbia University, New York, New York]? For--
Speaker 2: I went Columbia to library school.
Speaker 1: And what was the atmosphere at Columbia like?
Speaker 2: To me it was--you know I think that people say well people were prejudiced against you here, there and everywhere.  I think if I went in to do what I had to do and nobody stopped me from doing it that I wasn't maybe subliminally aware of something but not to the point where it got in the way of what I wanted to do.  I'm not sure about that but I think that's how it, how it came out.  My instructors I thought were wonderful, took, took a personal interest in me in some things so that I--
Speaker 1: Were there other black students there?
Speaker 2: Not many, there were a few, but not many, and I don't really remember them as such.
Speaker 1: And what about women, were there other women there (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It was basically women I mean, there were very few men.
Speaker 1: --in the library sciences?
Speaker 2: And even in the library system now, very few men and when you see them they want to be the directors, they (laughter) they don't wanna--I remember once when I was over at USF [University of South Florida, Tampa, Florida] and we were having comps and people would come in on you and you'd answer their questions about their studies and we'd say to this one, "What do you want?"  "I wanna be a children's librarian."  "What do you wanna be?"  "I wanna be a reference librarian."  "What do you wanna be?"  "I wanna be a cata- ." "And sir what do you wanna do?"  "I'm gonna be a director."  I said, "You don't even know anything yet, how are you gonna--?"  "I am going to be a director."  The men come in they're ready to be the directors.  That's--so library school was basically women, but.
Speaker 1: And how did you find--your study there, what was your focus when you were in library sciences school?
Speaker 2: That's when I really got into the young people, the children's literature and young people's materials and things like that.  Although I thoroughly enjoyed the history and the history of the book and things like that, that was very fasci- and a wonderful--I had a teacher we had something what they called--something or other in humanities, and this one sent us everywhere.  She said, "Every week you're gonna go someplace and see something in the humanities." And we went off to the various different kind of libraries and all the museums and you had to go look at these things and come back and write--not a long report, but your reactions to it.  That's when I ran into this work of Jackson Pollock, and I'm saying this is kind of weird but it takes a second look and you know you just, you learn to appreciate things without realizing that this was a good learning process.
Story_ID: 558998
Speaker 1: And so how many years were you at Columbia [Columbia University, New York, New York] studying library sciences?
Speaker 2: I went there in '43 [1943], I think I went there in '43 [1943], '44 [1944], took I think took two or three years and when I got out I said to my mother [Nettie Johnson Mays], "You know I've heard a lot about the South and I wanna see if it's really as bad as," (laughter), "as people say it is," and that's when I packed up myself and went to--I ended up in Florida, that was my first trip to Florida.
Speaker 1: And which school did you arrive at when you--
Speaker 2: I arrived at Florida A and M [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical College for Negroes; Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida] because they offered the highest salary of all the schools that I wrote to.
Speaker 1: And what was your position there?
Speaker 2: I was a cataloger.
Speaker 1: And what did being a cataloger involve and how did you enjoy that?
Speaker 2: It was interesting cause you get to box the new books and they're all you know just fresh books and you, you learn the Dewey Decimal, you've learned the Dewey Decimal System [Dewey Decimal Classification], you learn Sears cataloging list [Sears List of Subject Headings] so you just put the books together and (unclear) enough so that people can use 'em or find 'em on the shelf, it was fun.
Speaker 1: And so how long were you at FAMU?
Speaker 2: I stayed there for two years, it was weird, it was interesting.
Speaker 1: Was it significantly different from New York [New York]?
Speaker 2: Significantly, yes.
Speaker 1: How did you find it?
Speaker 2: Well first place you--I mean the South, this is real Old South now, and with, with the color line very, very obvious, very, very obvious.  When you went into a store if you wanted to try on something you had to take it to the--back to the campus and try it on and take it back if you didn't like 'cause you couldn't go and use the dressing rooms.  If you wanted to try on a hat they put the Kleenex around the inside of the hat so if you put it on your head the Kleenex would be between you and the band and the hat--very, and of course you didn't tell anybody you saw what your first name was because you suddenly became on a first name basis (laughter).  One of the women went down, she was one of the deans and her name was Irene DeCoursey, but she use I.R. DeCoursey as her name (laughter), and she, she went into the store one time and lady said to her, "What is your name," and she said, "I.R. DeCoursey," and the lady said, "No, I am DeCoursey."  She said, "Maybe you am but I.R. DeCoursey," (laughter), and the poor lady didn't know what to--she didn't know how to answer that, but that was, but that was the kind of level thing that, that it was.
Speaker 1: And what about at the university, did you find things different than your--than the time you spent at Columbia or at Hunter [Hunter College, New York, New York]?
Speaker 2: You mean at?
Speaker 1: At FAMU, while you working there as a cataloguer (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well at FAMU a worker, I was appalled at--I don't know how to say this 'cause people think it's a snobbish thing to say, but I was appalled at what they-- the educational level that they let students graduate with.  I was really, I, I was really appalled.  I, I, just--I met some football players and they stayed in school the semester they were playing football and they were academically excused the next semester because they hadn't made the grade but they'd come back and play football again the next year.  It was--
Speaker 1: So that's in contrast to the Hunter College which was saying--
Speaker 2: You're gonna get it (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You're gonna get it done, and was that the same at Columbia?
Speaker 2: I think so because--well, in all the graduate schools, I mean if you didn't have a B average you didn't graduate.  That, that was it, that's just flat.  You were not allowed to make Cs and Ds and that was.
Speaker 1: That was not the case at FAMU?
Speaker 2: (Shakes head).
Speaker 1: Did you spend any time in New York while you were attending Florida A and M?  I mean no, while you were cataloging at Florida A and M?
Speaker 2: No, I would just go home for the summer (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You were there for the full two years?
Speaker 2: I would just go home for the summer and just come back.
Speaker 1: And did you do any other library activities besides cataloging while you were there?  Had you become interested in telling children's stories yet?
Speaker 2: No (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Did you spend any time doing that?
Speaker 2: No. Unh-uh.
Story_ID: 558999
Speaker 1: So after you finished at Florida A and M [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical College for Negroes; Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida] what do you decide to do?  Do you come back to New York [New York] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I came back to New York and went back into the public library system.
Speaker 1: And where and did you enter the public library system, did you go back to your branch at 135th Street?
Speaker 2: You know people must've thought I was a terrible librarian because I went to so many different branches, but that they gave me reasons why I was going to different branches, so I can't say that I--I never actually worked for salary at 135th Street Library [Countee Cullen Library, New York, New York].  My first salary job I think was at--I keep wanting to call it Bloomingdale [Bloomingdale Library, New York, New York].  That doesn't sound right, but one on 99th Street and Broadway [sic.].  It's Blooming- something or other, but Bloomingdale doesn't sound right, 'cause I don't--it wasn't the dry goods store.  That was my first salaried job and then I went to different branches I worked at Hamilton Grange [Hamilton Grange Library] on 145th Street [New York, New York].  I went to--I worked at Morrisania Branch Library [Morrisania Library, Bronx, New York] for a while.  I worked at Hunts Point [Hunts Point Library, Bronx, New York], and what they did with me when the neighborhood started changing and they needed to put another face in, I was that face and they said, "Well you get along with people, you know how to talk to people."  So I, I was a talking head (laughter) but it was fun.
Story_ID: 559000
Speaker 1: But one of the things--I was still specializing, I wanted to be children's librarian and Augusta Baker [Augusta Braxton Baker]--do you know that name at all?
Speaker 2: Yes I do and--
Speaker 1: She was one of my mentors.
Speaker 2: And is she at the 135th Street branch [135th Street Library; Countee Cullen Library, New York, New York] during this period (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) She was at 135th Street branch. She was the one that started the James Weldon Johnson children's book collection there which is now incorporated into Schomburg's reference collection [Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, New York, New York].
Speaker 2: Yes, and when you're returning from--to New York [New York], the 135th Street branch has already established the Schomburg Center, is that true?
Speaker 1: Well it was so, not in the building that it is now but they had established center, yes but not as--
Speaker 2: So--
Speaker 1: --not complete like it is, the whole big building, there was a collection called the Schomburg Collection [Schomburg Collection of Negro Literature, History and Prints] that was on the, on the third floor (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The third floor.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And at the time when you were there was a theater and interaction with the public in the basement?
Speaker 1: There was a little theater in the basement, yes because some of the poets use to come.  One time I went in the library but Dorothy Homer was still there and Sherwin Braithwaite [sic. William Stanley Braithwaite], and she said to me, "Henrietta [HistoryMaker Henrietta Smith], do you know Sherwin Braithwaite?"  I guess maybe that's somebody I should know but I don't and she said, "This is Sherwin Braithwaite," and then I went back and read some of his, his poetry.  So I think that library was a cultural center long before people thought of it as such, you know.
Speaker 2: So can we talk about--I wanna get back to what you were doing in the New York Public Library system [New York, New York], but you mentioned Augusta Baker.  Could you just talk a little bit about August Baker and what--and the James Weldon Johnson memorial collection and what her role was in really compiling books for young children (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Augusta Baker was a children's librarian at 135th Street Library.  I think she was there when Dorothy Homer was branch manager but you know when you're young you don't put all these pieces together. But Augusta wrote a pamphlet called 'Best Books for Negro Boys and Girls' [sic. 'Books about Negro Life for Children,' August Braxton Baker] and this was I think in 1944.  I was either still in library school [Columbia University, New York, New York] or going to library school then so it didn't say too much to me.  Now since I've done some research it's very important, but she was very distressed at the types of books that were being published with black characters in it.  So she went through the collection and picked out those books that spoke positively to the black child and she put together this brochure on best books for bla- for Negroes boys--'cause we were negroes at that time--but Negroes boys and girls, and the public library published it with this caveat: it will not be published unless you include in that collection the story of 'Little Black Sambo' ['The Story of Little Black Sambo,' Helen Bannerman].  Augusta Baker hated 'Little Black Sambo.'  If you ever wanted to see her feathers ruffled, just mention 'Little Black Sambo,' but she had to do it because the rest of the book--the rest of the brochure was that important.
Speaker 2: Do you have an idea about what type of images and ideas Ms. Baker was attempting to extract or to minimize in black children's literature?
Speaker 1: In her introduction she said when you look at some of the illustrations of the black child you have this stereotype, the banjo eyes, the liver lips, the kinky hair, the colorful clothes, you know the red jacket, the striped yellow and green vest, the purple pants, you know that kind--she said that is the stereotype of, of the black child.  She talked about the language that the black child was made to speak in those books, and then she countered that with those books that were written some by blacks and some by non-blacks who showed respect for the black child and she had those books listed in this brochure that she did. And then she picked out the books and kept them in this Johnson collection, those books that spoke well to, to the black, to the black experience.
Story_ID: 559001
Speaker 1: And in addition to that, did Ms. Baker [Augusta Braxton Baker] and other librarians at 135th Street [135th Street Library; Countee Cullen Library, New York, New York] contribute to the creation and the publication of additional books that spoke to them (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) She did a couple of black--of folktales that she did and Ellen Tarry did a couple of books.  Do you remember of a book called 'Hezekiah Horton' [Ellen Tarry]?
Speaker 1: I don't but please tell us about it.
Speaker 2: It was, it was a very wonderful book with photographs and some of the pictures are actually taken in Harlem [New York, New York] and one of 'em is a picture taken of the Apollo Theater [New York, New York] and you can actually read--what's who's feet- who's featured in the, in the play.  So there were a few writers.  It was very difficult for the writers to be published.  The major publishers did not publish black writings.  Many of the books that you could find at that time were published by the, the Associated Publishing Company [sic. Associated Publishers, Inc.], who's housed in Washington, D.C. And that's when you could find copies at that time of some of the black writings that were accepted.  The first major publishing house was Follett [Follett Publishing Company; Follett Corporation] who published one of Lorenz Graham's books.
Speaker 1: Can you just repeat that Follett.
Speaker 2: Follett, F-O-L-L-E-T-T publishing house, they published one of the first--one of the first publishing houses to sell a black book and that was 'South Town' by Lorenz Graham.  Which was--other companies said, "Oh it's too controversial, we can't, we can't, no, no, we can't touch this it's too controversial."  It was the story of a black boy in the South who defied all the laws of segregation and made something of himself and then he came up north and went to--became a doctor and he went back to South Town and treated one of the black--one of the white people who was one of his enemies when he was growing up as a young man.
Story_ID: 559002
Speaker 1: But that was--Augusta [Augusta Braxton Baker] was one of the leading forces in getting people to take a look at what was out there for the, the black child and what was out there not speaking well for the black child, and she was also--we have time?  She was also the one who said, "You're gonna be a storyteller."  Oh they had it when you said--and you wanna be a children's librarian, NYPL [New York Public Library, New York, New York] at that time they said you will tell stories.  Frances Spain [Frances Lander Spain], Lee (Unclear)--you will tell stories and when they said tell, they meant tell, T-E-L-L, tell.
Speaker 2: You're mentioning Frances Spain, what's her position in the New York Public Library?
Speaker 1: She was supervisor of children's services in NYPL before Augusta Baker.  Augusta Baker was the first African American to supervise all the libraries.  She was followed by Barbara Rollock, and these are the only two blacks that have ever done it.
Story_ID: 559003
Speaker 1: So let's talk a little, let's talk some more about Augusta Baker [Augusta Braxton Baker].  Do you--can you tell us, can you describe her for us and tell us maybe about some of your personal interactions with her?
Speaker 2: Okay, Augusta Baker, a tiny woman, but big.  You know what I mean, big in what she could and as I told you she said, "You're gonna tell stories."  Well they had told us that before but she really reinforced--"You're gonna tell--and remember when you're telling you are sharing this event and you are not the primary character therefore you dress down."  "Do what?"  "You dress down. You wear dark colors, no jewelry that jangles and you don't have a lot of stuff around you because you are just sharing an event." And then they would come around and you had to do a practice or practicum story while you know she's sitting there looking at you and you're saying okay am I doing this right?  Am I gonna remember the events? And you're scared to death until she relax--you relax when you finish and she smiles at you and you know that you did okay.  When I moved to Florida--moved--well, we're get to that more later, but when I moved to Florida I would come up in the summer, I was going back to Columbia [Columbia University, New York, New York] to get my master's in library science and I told Augusta I said, "I'm gonna be up for the summer, maybe I can do some part-time storytelling," and she would say, "I can give you ten hours a week if you do that much for me."  And that's when I use to go down in the parks but remembering what she had taught you went out to the park.  You might carry a book or two, but you really--she said your book is your Linus blanket.  You're not reading to the children, you're telling them this story, and that what we really--I don't think the people much of that now.  They use visuals and stuff like that but--
Speaker 1: So can you talk a little bit about that telling of a story?  What's involved in telling a story versus reading a story?
Speaker 2: When you tell it, it you say, "This is the event at which I was present. And Adrienne [Adrienne Jones] for some reason you missed it but here's what happened," and then you tell this story, you tell the Anansi stories or you tell the Peter Rabbit story or you tell how the cat made the--got to make the sound that it does.  The book may be over here, but you're telling and you know when you've done it okay because at one I have a favorite story and I tell 'The Cat's Purr' which was illustrated by Ashley Bryan, one of my favorite storytellers, and when I finished a little kid came up to me and she said, "You know what my cat didn't look like your cat."  In her head she had a cat and, and that's, that's the thing that Augusta and all the early storytellers embedded in your head that you were going to tell so that your audience visualize in their own heads what was happening, and the pacing and the diction I mean they, they were strict on how you did it.
Speaker 1: So tell us a bit about that, what did Ms. Baker instruct you in terms of the framework of the nuts and bolts of telling a story?
Speaker 2: The first place you learn the story, you don't say, "Today I'm gonna tell 'The Cat's Purr,'" pick it up today and go tell it.  You've read it and you've read it again and you read it again.  You've told it in front of a mirror, you've told it on tape.  You put the book way aside and then tell it again until it's down to where you want it to be.  The pacing, the diction, the motion and she would say, "Now remember, motion is not--if you're running up a hill you don't run across the floor, you let them see you by your motion run up that hill.  If you fall down, don't fall down because if you fall down you're gonna have trouble getting up." And she would you know give you those, those kind of things.  You don't go in with any chewing gum in your mouth, she would just--and if you had long hair enough of these distractions or things you know getting your hair out--none of that.  Every motion you make had to be important to that story or you don't make it, and every--even if you told the story yesterday you don't go tomorrow and tell it again without refreshing the story.  It makes it look easy but it's because you worked--worked on it to get it done, and as I said she would pop up sometime and just be there when you were, when you telling just to make sure you were doing what, what should be done.  We had a storytelling season that started, what is it, September and it went through the first Friday in May and then the first Friday in May all the storytellers got on the ferry boat and went over to Staten Island [New York] for the storytelling symposium and--each--the chosen storytellers would tell (laugher)--and Augusta said, "And they never let me be one of the chosen storytellers but when I became supervisor of children's work I became a storyteller and I told it." (Laughter) She was so funny, she was very, she was very interesting at that.
Story_ID: 559004
Speaker 1: She [Augusta Braxton Baker] was ver- a wonderful mentor because she was strict with you but she also helped you.  She didn't just sit on your case and then leave you to find out how to do it better.  She, she was very, very good with you, and she was the one that let me--when one summer when I was telling to go tell at the Hans Christian Andersen statue because that was one of the.
Speaker 2: And this is in Central Park [New York, New York]?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And you participated in the Hans Christian Andersen--it looked right at the impetus of that program.  Can you tell us a little bit about the program and?
Speaker 1: Well at that time--and I don't think they do it as much now--at that time all through the summer storytellers everywhere.  That was part of their summer job, not every, not every librarian, and the ones who were considered quality storytellers.  You took part of your summer job and you would tell at these various centers and you--it was interesting when you were telling in a park the children would just come like the Pied Piper called 'em, just come, gather around you and they were good, wonderful listeners.  They'd come outta the pool, they'd come from playing checkers and they come smelly and sweaty but coming and you'd tell them and when you're finished they'd just disappear, 'cause one of the things you did not do was to say, "Now what do you think this story meant to you?"  You don't, you don't go through all that.  You tell your story and you're through.
Speaker 2: (TAPE INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 1: And that was how it went, you were finished, you were through, you were gone.  One time I got a letter from Augusta, some lady had written a letter to her and said that she saw this storyteller in the park and even though the policeman rode by with his horse, the kids were so enthralled what the teller was telling that they paid no attention to the policeman with his horse and Augusta sent me a copy of the letter 'cause she looked on the schedule and said that, that was--I was the one who was telling at that time.  So I thought, yeah I guess I wasn't such a bad teller after all.
Speaker 2: And was Augusta--you said, or just illuminate for us--Augusta Baker was the person who hooked you into the Hans Christian Andersen storytelling hour?
Speaker 1: Yes, I was coming up one summer--that's what--my poor child [Cynthia Smith Jackson] had to tail around behind me sometime when I was telling.  Part of the time I was in school, part of the time I was telling and sometimes I had her with me, poor thing.  She had to go and hear these same stories over and over, but she was pretty good.
Story_ID: 559005
Speaker 1: Were you influenced by any of the other librarians who were at or had been at the 135th Street branch [135th Street Library; Countee Cullen Library, New York, New York]?
Speaker 2: I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I have a couple of names I could mention them.
Speaker 2: I don't know them, I don't.
Speaker 1: Sadie Peterson Delaney or Regina Anderson [Regina M. Anderson]?  They're, they're earlier than you, but I just wanted to ask, or Jean Blackwell Hutson?
Speaker 2: I know Jean's name, I know her name, I don't--she worked a lot of--with ALA [American Library Association] too and she was--wasn't she one of the head leader with the Schomburg Collection [Schomburg Collection of Negro Literature, History and Prints; Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, New York, New York] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Absolu- yes she was.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes. Um-hm.
Story_ID: 559006
Speaker 1: Okay now let's take, let's take you back just a bit.  You came from FAMU [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical College for Negroes; Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida], you're in New York [New York], you're working at a number of different branches and what kind of work besides storytelling are you doing in the New York area?
Speaker 2: Well then you were just a children's librarian.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You did whatever, you know you did the circulation desk; you did the reference, at night time you had to work on the reference desk.  I use to tell the adult librarians that, "The children's librarians are smarter than you all because we work upstairs and downstairs and you only work downstairs."  They were--when they came upstairs the children frightened them and they said, "We can't do reference, we can't work with these children.  We can't find what they want," so then we would say, "Okay just do circulation, anybody can check books out," but we, we did the regular work.  The classes would come in, sometimes they'd come for what they call library lessons.  Other times they would come for storytelling (laughter).  I remember one time though a class was scheduled to come for something and there were two of us and both of us had laryngitis.  I mean we could say nothing--(makes sound).  The teacher couldn't understand, she says, "Well can't you just talk over?"  "No we can't talk over the laryngitis, we have no voices."  "Well what am I gonna do with my class?"  I said, "Well you know tough." That's it.  They couldn't understand. "You, you were supposed to be there, you were supposed to take care of these children," and that was it, but those are the funny things that happened.
Story_ID: 559007
Speaker 1: So let's talk a bit about your family. You--are you married in 1949 (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Forty-nine [1949].
Speaker 1: And so can you tell us a little bit--who is your husband, how did you meet him and how did you decide to get married?
Speaker 2: I met him at Florida A&M [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical College for Negroes; Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida]; he came back--you know it--that was the war years.  So when the guys came back from the war [World War II, WWII], those of us who'd just gotten out of school we were on the same age level, but at Florida A&M they said, "You're a faculty member, he's a student, you don't--we can't."  Well you know what do you do, you're in your twenties, what are you gonna do?  Look at him and say, "Oh, he's a student I can't go out with him?"  No, so you went out with him and you got in deep trouble.  My husband was--should have graduated valedictorian of his class.  They didn't even let him graduate because we were going around together and so they mailed his diploma home to him.
Speaker 1: What was your husband's name and what his major at FAMU?
Speaker 2: He was a history major, his name was Isiah Courtney Smith [Isiah C. Smith], but he uses I.C., that's his legal name now and they, they mailed his diploma home to him and he has never gotten over it and never forgiven them. I think he's forgiven me I hope (laughter), so but that, that's how that came about.
Speaker 1: And that--
Speaker 2: And I catalogue, I was the cataloguer then and he was back in school (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And he did a lot of attendance at the library, and--
Speaker 2: But you know actually he was very studious and he used to walk around with a dictionary in his back pocket, that was the kind of guy he is. And now today he doesn't read fiction, he said, "If it's not real I don't need it."  I said, "But there's a lot of reality in fiction."  No, no, no. "If it's not real I don't read it," and that's the kind of person he is.  So we had--I met him there and he came to New York [New York] to go to law school.  I was back in New York by that time because he lived eight miles away from Stetson University [DeLand, Florida] which had one of the best law schools in the country, but because he was black he couldn't go there so the State of Florida paid for his law degree at Brooklyn Law School [Brooklyn, New York] which was a good thing because we were both in New York, it's like throwing the rabbit in the briar patch and it was, it was a good thing.
Speaker 1: And just a quick segue back to the fact that you were dating him openly and so he was prevented from walking in the graduation?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And did they explain that to him or did he suffer any other--
Speaker 2: No he didn't suffer anything he just was angry.
Speaker 1: --other punishments?
Speaker 2: Because they told him he couldn't, he couldn't march--disciplinary reasons he couldn't march.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: And that's when I said, "Okay I'm leaving too and I, I--."  They said, "We, we like what you've done."  I said, "I'm sorry but I'm outta here."  I went back and then I went back into the public library system and worked some more.
Speaker 1: So you are, so you are--when do you get married and do you get married in New York?
Speaker 2: We got married in New York, right at the same Grace Congregational Church [Grace Congregational Church of Harlem; Grace Congregational Church of Harlem United Church of Christ, New York, New York] where I still go when I come up here.
Speaker 1: And did he do any practice in New York once you were married and he had graduated (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) (Laughter) I told everybody he got his little law degree in this hand and got in his car and drove to Florida.  He had made plans with his school buddy. They'd gone to college together, William Holland.
Speaker 1: William Holland?
Speaker 2: And made plans with them that they were gonna go into partnership when he finished his degree.
Speaker 1: Holland was already in Florida (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And had Holland already?
Speaker 1: Okay because--
Speaker 2: He was already there.
Speaker 1: --Holland did a similar thing, he went to Boston University [Boston University School of Law, Boston, Massachusetts].
Speaker 2: He went to Boston University paid for by the State of Florida, which you know again, you know you go to the best schools and Florida pays for 'em with their brilliance which was fine.
Speaker 1: And that was a program that was set up to ensure that black students were receiving higher education?
Speaker 2: That, that you could get education if you weren't able to go to a school in a state that there--if there was a quality school outside the state that you could go to then you went.
Speaker 1: And was that a law that applied directly to segregation?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, yes.
Speaker 1: How--tell us a little bit more about that?
Speaker 2: Well it was that these schools were not, you could not go.  Schools were totally separated, white schools and black schools.  Stetson was a university law school but it took only white students.  You have the qualifications to go to law school, therefore if you can find a school that will accept you they'll pay for it, transportation, everything.  So my husband went to Brooklyn Law School, Holland went to Boston law school, then they went back to West Palm Beach [Florida] and established their firm.  They stayed together for thirty-two years.
Story_ID: 559008
Speaker 1: When your husband [Isiah C. Smith] left to return back to Florida to be in a partnership, had you started a family?  How did you organize your family (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) (Gesture) This one, this one; we, we were to- we were in New York [New York] for a year and I, I was still working part-time.  I lived in Brooklyn [New York], had to get up in the morning, get her ready, take her to a babysitter, get on the subway and go.  I think that's when I was working at Hamilton Grange Library [New York, New York] up to 145th Street, and working and go back and go pick her up and--
Speaker 1: What's your first daughter's name?
Speaker 2: This is Cynthia Annette Smith--Jackson [Cynthia Smith Jackson], I'm sorry she did get married (laughter).
Speaker 1: And so they were, you were there the three of you for that year for that one year?
Speaker 2: When he was in school, but she--he was there with her 'til she was a year old and he left right after she was a year old, he went and he was down there and we down when she was three.
Speaker 1: And perhaps he commuted in between those years?
Speaker 2: No, he came up for Christmas I think but money was--we had no money.  I'm working part-time, he's struggling to get started, you couldn't do all this running back and forth so.
Story_ID: 559009
Speaker 1: Now your husband [Isiah C. Smith] and Mr. Holland [William Holland], what kind of cases are--what kind of case law are they taking on in Florida (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Whatever. Whatever. 'Cause first thing--
Speaker 1: I know that Mr. Holland is known as, as a civil rights activist in the Palm Beach [Florida] area but in terms of their bread and butter?
Speaker 2: They took on everything, they--one of my husband's first cases was a murder case, which he won.
Speaker 1: And was he located in the black community--
Speaker 2: Yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) and did he have black clients?
Speaker 2: Basically black clients (laughter), it was funny when he first started when he would go to the jailhouse to talk to one of his clients and the other guys would say, "Man, you lost.  That black lawyer ain't gonna be able to talk to that judge up there.  You just, you lost your case already."  He had to prove himself and one of the first cases he won was because the other lawyers on the other side had not prepared themselves, and the judge said to them, "Your case would have been a winning case, but this lawyer has prepared himself, dotted every I, crossed every T," so he won by the way he presented his case.  So, they, they were a good team, they were a good team and they were both very much into civil rights and activism in that case because between them they were the ones that started the integration of the schools and the golf courses and all of that in, in Florida, in that Palm Beach area.
Speaker 1: And did you--I notice that they did do quite a bit of desegregating in the schools, did you and your husband have that as a similar interest?  Youth in general or you and Mr. Holland did you all?
Speaker 2: That, those (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Talk at all about children's services as it were?
Speaker 2: They were interested in getting the sources integrated because you knew separate was not equal.  When I was at--in the school system I can remember one time when they sent over to the school I was working, they sent the manual typewriters because the white schools had just gotten some new electric typewriters.
Speaker 1: This is in Broward County [Florida]?
Speaker 2: In Broward County, so it was that kind of inequities that you saw you know when they'd send the textbooks over that had been--
Speaker 1: Used.
Speaker 2: And you were supposed to say, "Oh this is in good condition," and that, that kind of thing, and it was, it was very blatant.  You saw it everywhere, you saw it everywhere.
Speaker 1: And is this is the same community that your husband and Mr. Holland are from?
Speaker 2: No, Bill was born--Bill Holland was born in the Orlando [Florida] area which is central Florida.  My husband was born in DeLand [Florida] in Lake Helen [Florida] which is--DeLand is the closest big town, about thirty miles east of Daytona Beach [Florida] but they met at Florida A&M [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical College for Negroes; Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida], that's when they became friends, and they made a pact then that when they finished law school they were going to be partners.  Bill had established an office in Orlando when he finished 'cause he finished a little before my husband did, and then when my husband came down then they established an office in West Palm Beach [Florida].
Story_ID: 559010
Speaker 1: And you stayed in New York [New York] until you finished your master's [degree] at Columbia [Columbia University, New York, New York] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm, see when we--when I got out of Columbia the first time it was a bachelor's [degree] which they said was equal to a master's.  I don't like equal to, so I went back to get the master's and Florida paid for me to go back and do that.  Now that's when I did some of my storytelling for Augusta Baker [Augusta Braxton Baker] too when I went up there 'cause I was just there for the summer too to do that.  Now that's when I did some of my storytelling for Augusta Baker too when I went up there 'cause I was just there for the summer too to do that, and that was fun I had a good time.
Speaker 1: And, so when you were returning for the summer and studying at Columbia you finished doing that so you stopped coming to New York for the summers, and--
Speaker 2: No, I would come as often as I could.
Speaker 1: Okay, but it--
Speaker 2: But I didn't come really to work you know I would come by I couldn't stay.  I didn't stay as long, I might come up for a couple of weeks or I might travel, it all depended on what I decided to do.
Speaker 1: But eventually did you decide to move to Broward County [Florida] with your children and take a job?
Speaker 2: I never lived in Broward County.
Speaker 1: I'm sorry--did you plan, decided to move to Florida and take a job at Broward County?
Speaker 2: When I moved to Florida that was--he'd [Smith's husband, Isiah C. Smith], he'd already been down there, so I knew I was gonna have to move, I didn't want to but I knew I was gonna have to.  When we moved to Florida and I moved in to Delray Beach [Florida] which was actually twenty miles south of where he worked and the only job I could get was in the public schools in Broward County which was twenty miles south of where we lived.  I came down hoping I could get a job in the public library in Delray and they said, "Well you could be page," and I said, "But I have a degree."  "Oh well we can't hire you, we don't have a position for a black as a professional."
Speaker 1: So the Florida public library system is segregated at this time?
Speaker 2: At that time, um-hm.
Speaker 1: And that includes both using the library and the staff of the library?
Speaker 2: And the staff, um-hm so then I got a job in the school system (laughter) and that was funny too when I--there was a library, a library opening in Palm Beach County [Florida] and there was this librarian who had gone to school in Florida and this damn Yankee who'd come from New York.  So the lady who went to school in Florida got the job at Palm Beach County.   So I'm still without a job, but then I heard there was a job in Pompano Beach [Florida] at the school there or in Attucks High School [Crispus Attucks High School; Crispus Attucks Middle School] which was in Hollywood [Florida] which was another thirty miles away.  I didn't drive, 'cause you don't need to in New York, she [Smith's daughter, Cynthia Smith Jackson] drives like a wildcat but I don't, I don't drive in New York.  I went down there I didn't drive so I said well I've gotta get somebody who can get me at least to this closest school to where I live.  So I got the job in Pompano.  It was at the--when I went there was a first grade through twelfth grade school.  Everything was--you had two card catalogs, two shelf lists, two sets of books, two bulletin boards, two of everything because you had the little kids and then you had the big kids.  Gradually they took away the, the lower grades and they went to another established elementary school for them, but that was, that was how that was.  So I got into the--that's when I got into the public school system I'd--'cause in New York I never worked in the public school system.
Story_ID: 559011
Speaker 1: And what did you do for the public school system in Florida?
Speaker 2: I was a librarian in that school system.  I worked in that school--same school for many, many years.  Then the government came through with this--it was some kind of government program at the county level, but you had to have an integrated staff there.  So they were looking for an African American who had a master's degree in library science to take this job at the county, county level.  There were only three of us in Broward County [Florida] who had master's so they kept--they choose between the three of us and I was the lucky one that got chosen and I worked at the, the county level as a media s- supervisor (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Media consultant?
Speaker 2: --media consultant and you went from school to school showing them how to do more than just read from the textbook, show them how to use visuals, how to use new equipment, how to use simple cameras with the kids to do more than just sit in your sit in your seat and use ditto sheets to do, to do your work.
Speaker 1: So as a media consultant you're really working with teachers and staff--
Speaker 2: Teachers--
Speaker 1: --in the schools (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) and sometimes with, with students too 'cause sometimes you do workshop with the children and I also did some storytelling on television to go with the educational program there.
Speaker 1: Would that have been public access?  I mean how did the television work?
Speaker 2: That was an educational TVs in the educational TV studio and then they'd beam it into the different schools.
Speaker 1: And what age groups were you telling stories for when you were doing that in Broward County (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Basically for elementary school.
Story_ID: 559012
Speaker 1: After that experience did you decide that you're gonna get a doctorate?
Speaker 2: I have--in the back of my head I always wanted to do university teaching and I knew that I couldn't do it without the degree, at least I felt that I couldn't or that I shouldn't.  So I decided then that I would get my degree, if I could.  So I went to the University of Miami [Coral Gables, Florida] and because you were in this teaching business they paid half of your tuition which made it--made it very good and I had a wonder- I had a great time.  They took a lot of my credits from library school [Columbia University, New York, New York] because they said, "Well you've got a master's [degree] and a bachelor's [degree] so you--we took some of those credits," so it cut down the time that I had to go, go to school.
Speaker 1: Did you have a focus or a specialty while you were a Ph.D. student at the University of Miami?
Speaker 2: No, just to get the degree in education--some phase of education because I knew that I wanted to go into education and I still wanted to do my children's, or do my, you know, children's literature type, type work so that's what I did.
Story_ID: 559013
Speaker 1: When I finished the degree [at the University of Miami, Coral Gables, Florida] (laughter) it was strange.  I was still working for Broward County [Florida] school system and they said--they--the government was you know filtering out this job that we had as consultants and they wrote me a letter and said you, you have your degree and we know that well now you've got to find yourself a job in one of the systems.  I'm saying, I gotta do what?  I've got to find a job?  But then I had been offered the suggestion that I could come to FAU if the powers that be voted to take you in.
Speaker 2: FAU?
Speaker 1: Florida Atlantic University [Boca Raton, Florida], so I put in my papers there and I left the Broward school system and went to Florida Atlantic University to teach.
Speaker 2: Now I understand that the Broward County library established an African American Research Library [African American Research Library and Cultural Center, Fort Lauderdale, Florida] recently?
Speaker 1: Um-hm, yeah.
Speaker 2: And that in 1996 their county library was designated the library of the year.  As a media consultant for Broward County, did you have any real relationship with the Bounty Coward library?
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: Broward County library (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Library--no.
Speaker 2: Okay I just wanted to ask that.  So you decided to take a job at Florida Atlantic University?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And are you teaching in the College of Education?
Speaker 1: I was teaching in the College of Education where I taught my children's literature classes and I taught language arts which was very, very different, but I tried to incorporate--it was when I tried to incorporate in the language arts the use of the library as one of the things that teachers should do (laughter).  Some of the people said, "We don't need to do this, that's the librarian's job."  I'm saying, "Wait a minute, this child is not cut into little pieces, the child in the library, the child in your reading class, the child--it's all one little body that you're gonna put together."  So they were very unhappy, some of 'em.  You know but students are unhappy anyway, no matter what you do, I've found. But I guess I was unhappy sometimes too (laughter) when I was on the other side of the desk, and I liked, I enjoyed it.
Speaker 2: You enjoyed the faculty?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And how long did you stay there?
Speaker 1: I stayed there from '75 [1975] to '85 [1985].
Speaker 2: And then did you become tenured there?
Speaker 1: Yes and I was very lucky, when I left there and went and to USF they took my tenure, they took my promotion, they took everything.
Speaker 2: USF?
Speaker 1: University of South--I'm sorry we use those acronyms.
Speaker 2: That's okay I just wanna make sure for our listeners.
Speaker 1: University of South Florida [Tampa, Florida].
Speaker 2: Now.
Speaker 1: They changed the program at Florida Atlantic University; they changed what I was doing.  They changed the whole College of Education focus and offered me the position of working with student teachers which was not my, my thing.  I just--you know, you know what you can do, you know what you think you're feeling decent at and I told 'em no, and I went home and I told my husband [Isiah C. Smith], I said, "We've been working together for all these years," I said, "but you're gonna have to support me now 'cause I'm leaving my job." He said, "You're doing what?"  I said, "Well they're taking away the thing that I want to do so I'm just gonna quit."  In the meantime I get this phone--the phone call comes to FA, Florida Atlantic University, the dean asking about me possibly coming to the University of South Florida.
Speaker 2: Okay, let's back up just a moment because you indicated that at Florida Atlantic University that you earned tenure but that somehow that tenure was dissolved?
Speaker 1: No, it wasn't dissolved they just told me that I was gonna have a different focus--
Speaker 2: I see (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) in what I had to do, my responsibilities, my assignment was gonna be what I didn't want to do.
Speaker 2: So you essentially had to forfeit that tenure?
Speaker 1: I was surprised I didn't--when I went to Flor- to University of South Florida they took the tenure which they don't--they didn't have to do it but I was--well you know I'm very active in my professional organizations and when you get to know people at different stages of your life and in different situations, your reputation is with them, so they, the University of South Florida knew me not as an instructor at Florida Atlantic University, but as somebody who did workshops and presentations at all the professional organizations, so when they asked me to come they took my tenure, they took my line they took everything that I had at Florida Atlantic University.
Speaker 2: Now you indicated that the Broward County school system needed to have a more integrated phase and so you were able to work--
Speaker 1: When I worked (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) at Pompano [Pompano Beach, Florida].
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: What does the racial makeup of the faculty at Florida Atlantic University look like and maybe you'll lead us into--
Speaker 1: In the College of Education (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) into the University of South Florida.
Speaker 1: I was it, I was the first black they had in the College of Education at Florida Atlantic University.
Speaker 2: You weren't the only woman were you?
Speaker 1: No I wasn't the only woman?
Speaker 2: Um and so what was it like (laughter) to be?
Speaker 1: (Laughter) It--well I can give you a good example, that one day the dean of the college came to me and he said, "Henrietta [HistoryMaker Henrietta Smith] you have a problem."  I said, "What'd I do now?"  He said, "No, no, no," he said, "but we need a minority person and we need a woman and you're it."  I said, "I don't have the problem," I said, "you have the problem."  I said, "Because I've been on the curriculum committee, I've been on the disciplinary committee, I've been on the promotion tenure committee, I've paid my dues."  He said, "What, what--?"  So it was, yeah they had a problem, they had a problem.
Story_ID: 559014
Speaker 1: So you're at Florida Atlantic [Florida Atlantic University, Boca Raton, Florida] where the black faculty is very slim, and (laughter) you go to the University of South Florida [Tampa, Florida] where you're the first black faculty member, what, what's the atmosphere at the University of South Florida like for you?
Speaker 2: Well, they, they were most welcoming because I, I knew all of those people before I got there.  That was--as I said through the professional organization I had met them all.  The director of the library school whose name happened--last name was Smith was also a children's--well, not also, she was the children's knowledgeable person.  She did--I learned my history of children's literature from listening to her.
Speaker 1: And what was her name?
Speaker 2: Her name was Alice Smith, Alice Cullen [ph.] Smith and I met her through Augusta Baker [Augusta Braxton Baker], (laughter) I mean way back before I even knew I was gonna go to USF to work.  I met her through Augusta Baker. Because Augusta was gonna go over there and do a storytelling workshop doing some conference time and I said, "Augusta's gonna be in Florida, I'm going," and I went over to Tampa [Florida] and that's when I met Alice Smith and we talked a little bit about storytelling and things like that.  I guess Augusta told her a little bit about me, so that was--you know that seed was planted without even knowing what happened.  So when I went over to work I knew Alice and I knew from the professional meetings I knew the other, some of the other faculty members.  So it was like you weren't a stranger when, when you got there.
Speaker 1: Which professional organizations were you a member of that were also attended by some of the--your colleagues?
Speaker 2: Well in Florida I belong to FAME [Florida Association for Media in Education] which was a school media specialist organization, Florida Library Association which is a basic public library.  Then I joined--and of course I've been a member of the American Library Association for years.  Every once and a while I went to the NCTE, National Council of Teachers of English 'cause I think you know libraries in English and reading are all tied together, so.
Speaker 1: So tell us about your time at the University of South Florida?
Speaker 2: It was very interesting because I still continued to live in Delray [Delray Beach, Florida], and I told them, "If I take this job I'm not mobile, I cannot move to Tampa."  They said, "Well that's all right we'll bring you over for class."  So I was--fly over in the mornings teach, sleep over and fly back.  They got to know me in the airport, they knew me at the car place they said, "Oh, you're here for your car, we have one ready for--," you know so it was fun.  After a while I got a little bit old (laughter) you know running back and forth and I taught in Tampa, I taught in Fort Myers [Florida].  I taught in Sarasota [Florida] in, in those areas and then taught over here on the main--over here in the mainland and on the west coast also.  Then in 1993 I said okay I'm gonna retire, then an incident came up that made me say I can't retire yet, we can't lose what we have over here on the east coast.  So I told the new director I said, "I will teach for as long as we're on this little rocking horse that may fall over any minute," so and I'm still teaching (laughter).
Speaker 1: What was--what did you think was the crisis rocking horse at that time
Speaker 2: Well when I said that I was gonna retire Florida State University [Tallahassee, Florida] said okay, we're gonna take over the library school that you've established there because you won't have a faculty presence on the east coast.  We had built this program up and they had just decided: we're taking it because you won't have a faculty presence.  So I said to the dean, the new dean, "You need a faculty presence?  You've got one," so and I've been there ever since.
Speaker 1: And I understand that there's a master's residency in your name established there?
Speaker 2: It's--they call it the residency in the university library center and it's two years.  A student who graduates from our program gets a schola- well I don't know whether they call it a schola- residency.  They're positions like a faculty position with all the benefits and they have two years to hone their skills as, as librarians.
Story_ID: 559015
Speaker 1: So I wanted to ask you about some, some librarians. Some of whom are in Florida, some in New York [New York], and perhaps with the ALA [American Library Association] and I was hoping that you could indicate whether or not you knew the person and just tell us a little bit about your interaction with them?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Do you know E.J. Josey?
Speaker 2: E.J. Josey was very important to us.  We have in the American Library Association, I don't know whether you heard of the Coretta Scott King Award and when we first started this award our organization the Coretta Scott King Award committee [Coretta Scott King Book Awards Committee] was not recognized by the American Library Association.  E.J. came in as executive secretary of the American Library Association and one of the first things he did was see to it that the Coretta Scott King Award committee was established as a recognized group in the American Library Association, and we will never forget him for that and he would come, he'd come to the breakfasts and he would remind people that we are a part, an official part, we came in under the Social Responsibilities Roundtable as our thing because if you're not officially a part of the American Library Association--when we had our breakfasts we had it a hotel off the, off the campus site, I mean off the official ALA site.  It was--the awards were not recognized by anybody or anything.  So.
Speaker 1: So was E.J. Josey the first black president of the ALA?
Speaker 2: Um I think he was, I think he was.
Speaker 1: And (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The next one was Doris--Clara Jones [Clara Stanton Jones], she was the first woman to, to do it and what--I think Wedgeworth [Robert Wedgeworth] was the president at one time, was he or?  I know he was a executive secretary but I'm not sure about that.
Story_ID: 559016
Speaker 1: And do you, is the Cor- getting away from our list of people (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay (laughter) yeah.
Speaker 1: --which I said I was gonna do because this is a great segue into the Coretta Scott King Awards.  Aren't, aren't there two other awards associated with the American Library Association are--that are already established?
Speaker 2: They were--well there's several awards but the thing that we observed was that the Newbery award [John Newbery Medal] which is for the best book--text for young adults, or children and young adults and the Caldecott award [Caldecott Medal] which is for the very best illustrator.  They--one was started in 1922, one was started in 1938 and in all those years they never recognized an African American writer or illustrator.
Speaker 1: And these are the most--
Speaker 2: Those are the most prestigious (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) prestigious awards given by the ALA?
Speaker 2: Well we consider now that the Coretta Scott King is the most prestigious one to date (laughter).
Speaker 1: Absolutely.
Speaker 2: But (laughter) at--no, but that was really the, the basis of it and so somebody said well back in 1969 or so Mabel McKissick, Glyndon Flynt Greer who was also a New York Public Library [New York, New York] librarian in case you didn't have her name on your list and this man John Carroll who was a publisher for some little publishing house, and they were looking at his--at a picture of Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] and they started mentioning the fact that there was no award for this Newbery Calde- and this man said, "Well why don't you all establish one?"  And that's when--that was when the seed was planted and from there it grew and they said, "Well we won't name it the Martin Luther King award," but Glyndon Greer was friendly with Coretta Scott King so they named it Coretta Scott King without her knowing anything about it unfortunately (laughter), but that's how it all started.
Speaker 1: And the first Coretta Scott King Book Award went to a book about Martin Luther King.  Is that true (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah it's Lillie Patterson ['Martin Luther King, Jr.: Man of Peace'], very.
Speaker 1: And was that--
Speaker 2: A very simple little reader about the life of Martin Luther King, but it was timely because he had just been assassinated the year before you know so it was sort of fit into what we were thinking about.  Lillie Patterson died in 1999 but she was the first one to receive that award.
Speaker 1: And you said that original group was Glyndon Flynt Greer (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Glyndon Flynt Greer--
Speaker 1: --Mabel McKissick--
Speaker 2: --Mabel McKissick.
Speaker 1: And you mentioned someone I didn't have?
Speaker 2: John Carroll. John Carroll.
Speaker 1: John Carroll, and then that first book is by Lillie Patterson?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And does the Coretta Scott King Book Awards have the--have a similar award for illustration?
Speaker 2: At first they didn't but in 1974 I think it was they gave the first illustrator award, and that went to--oh.
Speaker 1: I have George Ford for Sharon Mathis' [Sharon Bell Mathis] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) George Ford, yeah George Ford.
Speaker 1: --for Sharon Mathis' 'Ray Charles'?
Speaker 2: Right, 'Ray' and they had just--two years ago they brought that book back again so it's been back in print.
Speaker 1: And it seems that almost immediately this Coretta Scott King Book Award carried a similar prestige?
Speaker 2: Not immediately, no.
Speaker 1: How did that work?
Speaker 2: It was a growing process, it was--we kept, we kept at it, the committee [Coretta Scott King Book Awards Committee] just kept going, we kept saying will we have it?  We had the breakfast every year, sometimes it was attended sometime it wasn't but we didn't stop and now--I could tell you this.  Last year we had the second largest attendance since it's been established.  We had 750 people to breakfast at seven o'clock in the morning. At seven o'clock in the morning 750 people.
Speaker 1: And Ms. King before she died, did she become involved with the award or she simply was the name?
Speaker 2: It was--
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: As I say Glyndon Greer was friendly with Mrs. King.  Mrs. King's first reaction was "They wanna use my name."  Glyndon took it as a tribute to Mrs. King 'cause she said everything in the world's gonna be named for Martin Luther King so let's give it to Coretta Scott King.  She came to a couple of breakfasts and I think she recognized that we were not playing on her name, but that we were honoring our writers and illustrators and her name was the platform under which they stood.
Story_ID: 559017
Speaker 1: And we also now have the New Talent Award [John Steptoe New Talent Award].  You have the John Steptoe New (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The John Stepton [sic.]? Yes.
Speaker 1: Um-hm and that was--
Speaker 2: And that's for someone who's under three years--
Speaker 1: That's when--their first work has--they cannot have more than three things published.
Speaker 2: More than three books?
Speaker 1: Um-hm. And John Steptoe was a very young--he lived in Brooklyn [New York], a young illustrator who died earlier than he should have, and we got though his son Javaka [Javaka Steptoe], we got permission to establish the award in his name.
Speaker 2: And did you say what year that award started?
Speaker 1: I think the first one was given in 1990--I have it in a book that I brought here but I think was 1990 something and Sharon Draper did it for 'Tears of a Tiger' (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And--
Story_ID: 559018
Speaker 1: Since the imp- since the beginning of the award you've edited the Coretta Scott King Book Award--
Speaker 2: 'The Coretta Scott King Awards Book' ['The Coretta Scott King Awards Book: From Vision to Reality,' Henrietta Smith] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) companion books?
Speaker 2: It is a book that tells the story of the award and has in it a biography of the winners from the beginning to--and we're working now on the two--year 2009 edition which will come out I hope in June of 2009.  I have a copy here for you to see before it's all over if you like.
Speaker 1: Fantastic, do you have--could you tell us about a couple of books that have received Coretta Scott King Book Awards that were your favorites?  Perhaps you don't have one?
Speaker 2: Well I have a list of favorites but the one I think that everybody ought to read and I think young people ought--I had mentioned this, it is ought to be required reading for all the kids who say about slavery, "I wouldn't of let them do that to me."  They need to read Sharon Draper's 'Copper Sun.'  That's the Coretta Scott King Award for this year for stor- for text and I think every young person needs to read that book.
Story_ID: 559019
Speaker 1: Cynthia [Smith's daughter, Cynthia Smith Jackson] will attest to the fact that my favorite illustrator is Ashley Bryan.  I mean he's just--he's my heart but there are many illustrators (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) What books is he associated with, Ashley Bryan?
Speaker 1: Oh, where do we begin--you don't, you don't his name?
Speaker 2: I don't know Ashley Bryan well so tell us?
Speaker 1: Okay, Ashley Bryan is--he was born in Antigua, raised in the Bronx [New York], and he went to Dartmouth [Dartmouth College, Hanover, New Hampshire] and he taught art at Dartmouth.  He's retired now and he lives on an island in Maine.  I think he's the only black living on the island.  He is called the king.  He is the most knowledgeable, the most human, the most interesting, he's studied philosophy; he got a fellowship and studied in Germany; he illustrates, he writes stories, I'm--he's just a, what they call the man of all seasons and if you saw him walking down the street you wouldn't think he was anybody just another black guy walking down the street, and he plays a recorder, and he's very much into spirituals.  He thinks everybody needs to know the spirit and he's very upset that most of our kids don't know enough about spirituals.  He says he goes to Europe and the kids know the spirituals, they sing them, they understand 'em--our kids don't know 'em and so he has done at least four books, five now on spirituals, and when he talks about the spirituals he'll play one on his recorder and it is just so--it's a beautiful instrument.  Well one time he came down to do a program in our area and he called me and he said, "Guess what I did?"  I said, "What did you do?"  He said, "I left my recorder on the airplane."  I said, "Oh no, not that beautiful instrument?"  He said, "Oh, no, no it's all right, it's all right.  They have it but I won't have it to play for the children when I go to the school with you."  I said, "Well I, I have a little plastic recorder that I was taking methods, music methods in school," and I said--he said, "Bring it, I'll play it."  I didn't know that thing could make that kind of music.  He played that recorder, that's the kind of person he is, you give me what you have--and I wanna say if you have lemons you make lemonade. Absolutely a genius!  But there are a lot of other good ones out there too.  Bryan Collier does a lot with the children, [HistoryMaker] Jerry Pinkney's whole family is into the art world. I mean you could just go on and on.
Story_ID: 559020
Speaker 1: So let's talk about a couple other people in the library world, what about Sam Morrison?
Speaker 2: Sam was the one who was working the Broward County library system [Broward County, Florida].  He saw the lack of library service in the black area, but at that time he was--the position he was in he couldn't do anything about it.  He left the Broward County system and he went to Chicago [Illinois] and was director of library services in Chicago, and he came back to Florida and his goal was--he said, "I'm going to establish a library in the black area and when I finish that I'm gonna really retire," and that's exactly what he did, but he saw to it from breaking the ground to building the building, to dedicating that building and it is absolutely fan- nothing in there (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And this the African American Research Center?
Speaker 2: African American Research Library and Community--African American Research Library and Cultural Center [Fort Lauderdale, Florida] and we call it AARLCC for short.  Nothing in there is just a pure decoration even the posts in the lobby that--you know the supporting posts are designed with African American thematic designs on them.  Nothing is just there, they built the theater and they were even conscious of the fact they said black people, particularly black women are heavier in the bottom than most white people.  They made the seats a little bit bigger, I mean just that kind of thought pattern was what--was part of that.  They--there's a piece of, of huge wooden carving.  Once piece of wood with the whole story of blacks on it, it's--you'd have to see it to be able to even know it. And they have the Harambee Room and when you go there and stand in a certain part of the room, whatever you say is kind of echoed from the walls and on the walls they have the words of the Negro National Anthem ['Lift Every Voice and Sing'] and the kids go in there and the people have them to sing it and you can hear this reverberation of them singing that.  It's--everything was thought out to just a--and as soon as it was finished and he got it the way he wanted it to go he, he retired.  Oh he keeps checking on it though I mean he's not gone, gone.  He still lives in Fort Lauderdale [Florida].
Story_ID: 559021
Speaker 1: Do you know Doris Clark [sic. Doris Hargett Clack]?
Speaker 2: Doris Clark was the cataloger at Florida State University [Tallahassee, Florida], the one and only.  I don't think they have any blacks up there now.  The first and the only African American at Florida State and she taught cataloging, very wonderful, very intelligent, very lovable person.  She died of cancer about three years ago and she's well, she's missed very much.  So, she loved cataloging and I loved children's literature and we'd have these wonderful conversations about the joy of cataloging, and I'd say, "Oh yes," and I'd say, "the joys of children's literature," and she said, "Uh," you know (laughter) so.  She was a very nice person, I didn't get to know her real well but we had a nice relationship.
Story_ID: 559022
Speaker 1: And then a couple of people who I think are New York [New York] based, Lucille Thomas?
Speaker 2: She's Brooklyn [New York].
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And that's New York I guess (laughter) right.
Speaker 1: Well I have her down as the first black president of the New York Library Association?
Speaker 2: The New York Library Association.
Speaker 1: Of the black--
Speaker 2: Well.
Speaker 1: No, oh no she's the first black president--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --of the New York Library Association.
Speaker 2: And she's one of the first life- not the first but one of the first lifetime members of the American Library Association.  That's how much they think of her as a, as a person, and she's still very active.  I see her, she's served on council for ALA and she's very instrumental in building up the Brooklyn library system in the Brooklyn area. Um-hm, still very active.
Story_ID: 559023
Speaker 1: And what about Charlemae Robbins?
Speaker 2: Rollins.
Speaker 1: I'm sorry, Rollins (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Charlamae Rollins [Charlemae Hill Rollins] was the children's librarian, the counterpart to Augusta Baker [Augusta Braxton Baker] in Chicago [Illinois], established the children's services in Chicago, and she did, oh gosh, I wish I could remember these titles; she did a book for the NCTE [National Council of Teachers of English] similar to Augusta Baker's book on best books for blacks--for Negro boys and girls ['Books about Negro Life for Children,' August Braxton Baker].  She did one, oh it's gonna come to me.  I can't remember now what it was, and she also did several biographies about notable blacks as a writer, and she--I met her just briefly at one our ALA [American Library Association] meetings in Atlanta [Georgia] but she was--in Atlantic City [New Jersey] but she was beginning to fade away then, she wasn't--the person that I met was not the Charlemae Rollins that was in the library, but she was very strong--and in the ALA in the children's division they have the--one of the Charlemae Rollins presidents programs every year that focuses on some special aspect of children's literature and named for her because of her contributions to the children's services.
Story_ID: 559024
Speaker 1: What about Virginia Lacy Jones?
Speaker 2: Virginia Lacy Jones was the leader of the Atlanta University library school [Atlanta University School of Library Service; Atlanta University School of Library and Information Studies, Atlanta, Georgia].  She was its founder, she was its head professor, and she was a--she was a--you think I'm short (laughter), I think she came up to my shoulder (laughter) and she played the organ and she said, "They don't put the pedals right for the left handed organist," (laughter) you know she said they're--and she said, "And they don't have enough things for left handed people, they don't have can openers, they don't have refrigerator doors."  She was so funny, she was a wonderful librarian but her main contention was that they didn't have enough things for short people and for left handed people, but she was very, very instrumental in the Atlanta University library which unfortunately now has been dispensed with.  It was the first black accredited school for ALA [American Library Association] and they just--in fact, I think it was the only one.
Speaker 1: I think so too, I think it actually replaced another but I wanna make--I've forgotten now.  I wanna put it at Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.], no at Hampton [Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia] and I wanna say that the Hampton (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well the Hampton, the Hampton had a library school but it was not as--
Speaker 1: --program closed.
Speaker 2: --it was not as strong ever as Atlanta.  I mean if you went to Atlanta, you, you had been to the top.
Speaker 1: Well my understanding was that it replaced the Hampton program which had closed in 1938, and that Virginia Lacy Jones was the second dean there, and so it was sort of a continuation.
Story_ID: 559025
Speaker 1: Now outside of New York [New York], can you talk about [HistoryMaker] Effie Lee Morris?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes I know Effie. (Unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I know she's in--based in San Francisco [California], but--
Speaker 2: She's in San Francisco now but she was in NYPL [New York Public Library, New York, New York] at the time too.
Speaker 1: Oh, for the--the Library of the Blind [Library for the Blind and Physically Handicapped; Andrew Heiskell Braille and Talking Book Library, New York, New York]?
Speaker 2: She was very active in that, yes and she went to San Francisco and she continued that work out there.  Now they have an Effie Lee Lecture Series [Effie Lee Morris Lecture Series] every year and I just got a note in my email asking me if I would write a recommendation for her to become an honorary member of the American Library Association.  I hope I get back home in time to, to fill the paper out because it wasn't in the email.  They said the application is here but it was nothing there, so when I get back I will--yeah we've know each other, and I kept saying to--, "Effie Lee are you related to that Effie Lee who wrote the poetry," 'cause there was Effie Lee Newsome who wrote children's poetry back in the '40s [1940s] and she said no.  I said, "With Effie Lee it sound like very few people would have a name like that," but Effie Lee and Augusta Baker [Augusta Braxton Baker] and all those, they were on like a little--known each other for a long time.
Story_ID: 559026
Speaker 1: So let's talk about some of the other organizations that you've worked with, the Storytellers International?
Speaker 2: Oh, that was when I was going to New Mexico.  I met a lady back in Detroit [Michigan] one year back in 1980 something and she said that she was gonna--she heard--I don't know why I was telling, I was telling stories in Detroit, I don't know why (laughter) but anyway I was there and we met each other and she said that was gonna establish a storytelling fiesta in New Mexico, she said, "And I'm gonna ask you to come."  Well you know you're in, you live in Florida, you meet somebody in Detroit who at that time was living somewhere else.  I said the chances of meeting her again is like ninety to 10 million.  So I just put it in the back of my head and went my merry way, but I get this correspondence from her saying, we're trying to establish a date, can you come at such and such a time, and that was the beginning.  I think it was 1986, between '86 [1986] and '88 [1988] or something like that.  So I went out and we told stories, our first place was not a very good place for storytelling because it was on the grounds where they had the hot air balloon fiesta [Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta], well you know you can't compete with hot air balloons and stunt pilots (laughter) when you're trying to tell stories, but we (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Not like a horse--a policeman on a horse in Central Park [New York, New York].
Speaker 2: Right, but it--we, it was a beginning so we, we did it and I went for eleven years, we went every year and I had my first hot air balloon ride, what a thrill.  I come--see when I teach I tell them, I said, "If you become a storyteller you might get a chance to ride in a hot air balloon."  "We don't wanna do that," but it was fun.  Look--the man who had the balloon said, "Now you're gonna help me get this balloon up, if you're gonna ride in it, you're gonna work."  "Yes."  He said, "And you hold this fan and when I tell you to turn it off, you turn it off because I'm gonna put the hot, the propane gas in."  I could just have visions of this whole thing going up in smoke, but I'm holding this fan and I'm still holding this fan.  He said, "Okay, turn it off."  (Makes sound) I did it and then he put--and I went up and it was just oh, it was fascinating.

Speaker 1: So that was the beginning of my fiesta and I went every year and that's when I met, I don't know if I mentioned that, I met Blue Water, she's a Native American and she was killed in an automobile accident last year, but she's been named the national hero in New Mexico and she was honored by the National Endowment for the Humanities in Washington, D.C. last year, and.
Speaker 2: What--can you tell us a little about your action, interaction with Blue Water, what kind of stories did she tell, what was so special about her (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) She told her, she told her Native American stories about Rabbit and Coyote.  She told us how she got her name Blue Water.  She told, told us a little bit about the Indian [Native American] language, she told us about some of the customs of the Indians.  I've--in fact she invited me out to one, I went to one of their Indian festivals, the deer dance festival.  That's when the young men come and they have to run down from the mountain and they're all dressed up--they're painted and she used to--her grandchildren would come and she would--you saw her painting their faces with the colors that they were supposed to have on 'em and she was the only one.  They didn't want anybody else to do it but Blue Water, and they pulled out her--P'oe Tswa was her native name and she would paint them up and they'd have to go out early in the morning and run down this mountain and the girls would try to catch them, and if a girl caught them then you--the boy would have to go to this girl's house to eat dinner (laughter) and some of 'em didn't want to go with some of the girls (laughter) when they came down, when they came down the mountain.  But I saw, through her I was able to see one of the festivals and then we would go to some of the pueblos because she knew the people, we'd go to some of the pueblos and tell stories, and that was another thing I could teach my students.  When you're going out to tell stories, find out where you're going and what is expected of you before you go, so that you don't make a faux pas.  I went to one place and I told a story about the bear where the bear was made a clown and this woman said to me afterwards, "The bear in our culture is fetish and you do not laugh at the bear," and I said, "What do I know?"  There are certain stories that you don't tell at certain series of the year.  You don't tell us snakes at the wintertime where you don't--but you learn these things and it's all part of your, your growing.
Story_ID: 559028
Speaker 1: You've been a presenter at the REFORMA [REFORMA: The National Association to Promote Library & Information Services to Latinos and the Spanish Speaking] conference, which is an organization that expand- is expanding or promoting library information services for Spanish speakers (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, he's a Spanish, yeah. Well I did a--what did I do there, did I?  I know I went to a conference there and I had a session and I think I must've used some of my Hispanic books in getting people to know when you're teaching you have to incorporate every culture in whatever it is that you are doing and I helped the--helped them get their REFORMA award, or the Pura Belpre Award established because my friend said to me, "Well how do we get--you've the Coretta Scott King Award, but how do we get our award going?"  And I told her I said, "First place you have to crawl, you don't just get in there and get it," so what they finally--and they're, they're ten years old now.  They have book out that they did for their tenth anniversary and our Coretta Scott King group was recognized as one of the people that gave them the strength to keep on, keep on going, and they have a very nice--and they said, "We're having a celebration for our tenth anniversary.  You wanna come? It's from one o'clock until four." and I said, "What?  From one o'clock until four?" But it was really--the time went so fast but they recognized all the authors and illustrators.  Pura Belpre was part of the New York Public Library system [New York, New York], I don't know whether that was in your notes or not.
Speaker 1: It is actually, and I was wondering--I know that she eventually went to the 115th Street branch [115th Street Library; Harry Belafonte 115th Street Library, New York, New York] but she started out at 135th [135th Street Library; Countee Cullen Library, New York, New York].
Speaker 2: She started out at 135th Street, she was a wonderful storyteller but she didn't have that piece of paper. So she never could get to where she--but she was the first Hispanic background (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Can we just spell Pura Belpre for our--?
Speaker 2: Belpre, B-E-L-P-R-E with an accent on the--
Speaker 1: On the R?
Speaker 2: --E.
Speaker 1: On the E.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, Pura Belpre, Pura Belpre.
Speaker 1: And did you get a chance to work with her while you were at the 135th Street?
Speaker 2: No, no, but her favorite, her favorite story the one that every story, the one everybody knows 'Perez and Martina' [Pura Belpre] is the story of the mouse this, Perez--Martina was a very handsome mouse and she would sit on her porch 'cause she wanted to get married and she'd--these creatures would come up and say, "I hope--can I marry you?"  She said, "It depends on how you sing to me," and the frog would come, "Ribbit, ribbit, ribbit," and "No," and the duck would come up, "Quack, quack, quack." "No," and finally Perez came dressed in his finery and oh, he was so elegant and she said, "How will you sing," and he said (makes sound), so she married him but then he had an accident, he fell in pot of porridge.
Story_ID: 559029
Speaker 1: Is that the end of the story? Perez falls into the porridge?
Speaker 2: Well if you fall into a pot of hot porridge what?
Speaker 1: You're dead.
Speaker 2: You're dead.  Well one of the things we have to help children learn is death is a part of life.  I remember once when I was teaching at FAU [Florida Atlantic University, Boca Raton, Florida] I got a book on--it's called the 'Unbuilding' [David Macaulay] it's the story of the dismantling of the Empire State Building [New York, New York].  It's done by a very wonderful illustrator.  So one of colleagues was teaching children's literature that night, and I gave him a copy of the book, I said, "Take this up to your class, it's a wonderful new book and maybe they wanna see it."  He took it to his office and in about fifteen minutes he brought it back and he said, "I can't use this book."  I said, "Why not?"  He says, "It's doesn't have a happy ending, and I don't teach any literature that doesn't have a happy ending."  That's not life, when you're working with children you have to give them life and death is a part of life, and it isn't only animals that die, and that's part of what I do.  I do it with the teachers that I'm teaching and I do it with the children when I'm working with them and there's some wonderful stories that handle death beautifully for children.
Speaker 1: I saw a quote by you that indicated that you do not as a storyteller preach about the moral of the story or discuss that in anyway. You're simply laying the story out for the listener.  Can you talk a little bit about that?
Speaker 2: People underestimate what children understand.  You don't need to preach the moral, if the story ends with the moral and you say, "Well when you think about it the best way for this is sometimes is to say no to your very best friends," that's the end of the story.   If they're following the story along, you don't need to tell them that.  Now if I say to you today, "We're gonna analyze this story in terms of structure and vocabulary," you're going to listen a certain way.  If I say to you, "Today is story hour day, we're just gonna share stories. That's what we came to do and you go home with whatever you go home with."  With some it may be nothing, with some it's a lot.  I remember once years ago I was in a restaurant and this waiter came up to me and said, "You told us stories when we were in elementary school."  Here's this guy about six feet tall who remembered something that I told him, so you know you don't have to belabor children with what the moral is, that's, that's my belief anyway as a storyteller.
Story_ID: 559030
Speaker 1: Can you talk a little bit about the difference in the availability of books for African American students and perhaps in the presence of storytelling when you began your library sciences career, and now?  How much more is available, is more available?  What's the difference?
Speaker 2: A lot more is available in terms of books.  I'm not happy with how much of it is being used like I think it should be used.  Part of it is in education, some of the people who should be using these books are not.  I know when I first started teaching I would say to my students, "You're gonna have to read--among the books that you read, you're gonna have to read a Coretta Scott King Award book."  "Read a what?"  I said, "Coretta Scott King Award."  They don't know it.  As a teacher you should know.  If you're teaching literature, if you're teaching reading, if you're teaching anything that has to do with books, if you know Newbery [John Newbery Medal], if you know Caldecott [Caldecott Medal] you should know Coretta Scott King. "Well I know how to find the Newbery."  I said, "Well find the Coretta Scott King the same way."  It's happening better but it's not where I think it should be yet.
Story_ID: 559031
Speaker 1: And how do you feel about, for instance the work that Augusta Baker [Augusta Braxton Baker] did in terms of attempting to put some positive qualities on, and some historical context to African American children's books?
Speaker 2: I think early on when she started doing it, it was like a wakeup call.  Now the wakeup is not staying as much awake, I don't think.  I've taken, taken material into my classes and they look at me like where did you find something like that?  It's some of the things that if--I said, "You've been in the field this long and you don't know?"  I don't expect you to know everything that I know (laughter) 'cause if you did I wouldn't have to be here, but there's certain things that you should just know because you've lived this long and you've been in education this long and I find it inexcusable, you know.  It's not where I'd like it to be, but.
Speaker 1: Do you have any ideas or suggestions about the kind of things that need to happen in order to--?
Speaker 2: I think that if people, first of all I think that if you're in education, education of any kind that you should belong to your professional organization.  You should attend and you should attend more than just sitting there listening to what anybody else has to say.  Offer yourself as a presenter and then present something that expands the listener's knowledge of your particular field of interest.  When I go, if I do a storytelling workshop, I don't tell just African American stories, but I include other stories, but there will be African American stories and the background on those stories as well as anything else.  If I do poetry, I do all kinds of poetry.  I think you've got to let people know that the world is a mixed world and you have to keep growing in that sense.  If you don't you're not doing your job, you're not doing your job.
Story_ID: 559032
Speaker 1: And are libraries as important to African Americans today as they may have been when you were growing up at the 135th Street branch [135th Street Library; Countee Cullen Library, New York, New York]?
Speaker 2: I would say unfortunately no.  Right now we read a lot of articles even in our professional journals about what's going to happen to libraries, and then I also read about we have to make the libraries comfortable for the young people to want to come.  I have a problem with that, they come and they want the computer games, they want their music, but perish forbid that they have to do serious studying.  I have a problem with parents who come to a library and say, "Oh my child has to play tether ball this afternoon can you find this material for me for him for his assignment," and they get very upset with you if you say, "I cannot do his assignment."  "Well aren't you the librarian, what are you here for?  You're here to help your patron."  Where's the patron?  He's practicing tether ball.  So I have concerns but you just keep doing what you're doing and trying to--broaden the knowledge that people will listen to you.
Story_ID: 559033
Speaker 1: If you could choose your legacy what would it be?
Speaker 2: That's a good question.  Oh, somebody said to me one time, "If you had not been a librarian what would you have been?"  I said, "I have no idea because that's the only thing I've ever done."  Some aspect of library service is the only job I've ever, ever had and it's just been great.  I've met a lot of fine people. I know--in classes one, I can tell my students about illustrators that I know because I've met them face to face.  I mean the reason that I could do the introduction for 'Lift Every Voice and Sing' ['Lift Every Voice and Sing: A Pictorial Tribute to the Negro National Anthem,' James Weldon Johnson].  I had met Andrea Pinkney [Andrea Davis Pinkney] somewhere way back, she was Andrea Davis at that time before she married in to the Pinkney family.  She wrote and asked me she said, "Do you call it the African American anthem?"  I said, "No, to me it will always be the Negro National Anthem."  She said, "Okay then would you write the introduction for this pictorial book."  If I had said African American anthem, I would not have been asked to write that introduction.  When it was written it was dubbed the Negro National Anthem and I don't think we ought to, I don't think we have the right to change it, but that, that's my thing so I did the introduction from that, that perspective and we sing it all the time, and but the kids today don't know it.  I see them when we go to program and if the words aren't written on the back, they can't sing it.  But it was interesting at the Coretta Scott King Award breakfast we sing it every year and I've noticed, and now we do put it on the back and I notice now that everybody (laughter), but it was funny when we first started doing it before we put the words on the back some of the whites would stand up there and they'd say--and it's not easy to sing, then when they had the words it was still not easy to--it isn't a very easy thing to sing, but more and more it's getting to be the kind of thing that just rolls with the breakfast and it's, it's very good, and I, I hate anybody that says we're gonna change it and put it--it's not, it's not the African American, it came through hard times just like the African Americans did so (laughter) you know, but that's, that's it.
Story_ID: 559034
Speaker 1: My legacy is get out there, read a good book, share the book with the kids and let them--there was--what's his name Maurice Sendak did a pop up book and somebody said to him, "Well you know kids are gonna tear that book up."  He says, "That's good, let 'em tear it up.  They've enjoyed and then their mother will buy some more.  It's good business."  But let them have these books and use them with them.  When children come to my house if they behave nicely I give 'em a book to take home.  If they're restless I give 'em a book to look at 'cause I got books all over the place.  I need--I hate to go home now and see what's in the house, but the publisher will send you books 'cause they know that you use 'em.  At the end of each semester I'll give my students a couple of books to take home 'cause I got more than I n- want.  I tell 'em, partly I'm altruistic and part I'm cleaning out my house (laughter), but I give them books to take home with them.  When I had my retirement party it was, it was a big, it was fun.  It was really nice and I carried with me, I carried about two or three hundred books and I said to them, "At the end of each class what do we do?"  We said, "We have a party."  I said, "No, no other than having a party what do we do?"  They said, "Oh we get books," so I gave everybody who came to the pajama party I gave 'em a book to take home and it was--I think books are very important.  If I could do what I wanted to do I would read books and do my needlework.  I tell my students, "You have to type your papers 'cause I have my eyes to do my needlework."  So reading books and doing my needlework is--I don't cook, I don't keep a good clean house, I just--so that's who I am.
Speaker 2: We thank you for being involved in the library sciences and for sharing information about your career and your life today.
Speaker 1: It's been fun, it's a good way to go.
Speaker 2: Thank you (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) It's a good way to go.

Speaker 1: Oh this is my fourth grade picture taken in the school yard of Julia Ward Howe Junior High School, P.S. 81 [Julia Ward Howe Junior High School 81] on 120th [Street] and St. Nicolas Avenue [New York, New York].  I'm in that picture, can you find me?  Ah ha, there I am.  My hair was just growing back 'cause I'd had scarlet fever (laughter), and that's my teacher Mrs. Diamond [ph.], right there.  There were only two white children in the whole school and they happened to be in our class.  One of 'em was Lillian Bean [ph.], I don't know which one, the other was--I think her last name was Solomon [ph.].  One of them--father had, father had a candy store on the corner but we didn't go there and the one over here in the corner, Wilma Joseph [ph.] was the smartest--can you put way up--no, up above?  Wilma Joseph was the smartest girl in the class, that's Wilma.  The others I don't really remember.  One I know about but I don't--I won't bother with that one.  Okay, I don't know the other three.  I don't remember the other people.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: Oh, (makes sound), (laughter) that's my great-grand--(laughter), I'm sorry (laughter).
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  This time you'll know what to say because you've said it already.
Speaker 1: Don't, don't get me to giggle. I used to get sent from the table for giggling 'cause my sister [Emily Mays] would make eyes at me and--
Speaker 2: I used to get kicked out of school.
Speaker 1: No I didn't get kicked out of school, I was--it's a wonder I grew to womanhood 'cause I was sent from the table so often I should've starved to death but I didn't.  Anyway that's my great-grandfather, his name was Bogue Johnson [ph.].  The only think I know about him I learned from my Uncle Henry [Henry Johnson], that he was a big time gambler and he was never a slave.   He was a freeman, Bogue Johnson. This is my, my grandmother [Emily Johnson] over here to the right? That left? Right.  My grandmother over here to the right and her children, my Aunt Lottie [Lottie Johnson], my Aunt Sarah [Sarah Johnson], my Uncle George [George Johnson]--oh, is that my grandfather?
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  (Unclear).
Speaker 1: Johnson, they were all Johnsons at that time.  Uncle Henry is there.
Speaker 2: You said he was the opera--
Speaker 1: He was an opera person, yeah, and my Uncle Sam [Samuel Johnson], he's--Uncle George is in the back and Uncle Sam is in the front, and I think it was taken in Charleston [South Carolina].  It looks like the houses in Charleston, South Carolina but I can't exactly tell.  I don't know when it was taken or who took it.  My mother is not there, where she was I don't know.
Speaker 2: Tell us who that is?
Speaker 1: This is Ashley Bryan.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: Mrs. Smith's favorite child book illustrator.
Speaker 2: And we were together in South Africa at a conference and we went into a little gift shop and we took a picture there, Ashley Bryan, illustrator for (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Ashley Bryan.
Speaker 2: Illustrator, philosopher, musician, artist--in fact he was nominated for the Hans Christian Anderson Award for his illustrations last year which is the highest award in children's work that you can get.  He didn't get it, it went to a German person but that's all right he was nominated and that's an honor.
Speaker 1: (TAPE INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 2: --Son.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  I'm sorry can you repeat that?
Speaker 2: The gentleman in this picture is Sam Morrison.  He was the one who started the African American Research Library and Cultural Center in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.  He had been working in the Broward County library system for a while, left and went to Chicago [Illinois] and came back and had this library built indefinitely and positively in the black section of Fort Lauderdale, a very beautiful library with significance in every part of the building, Sam Morrison.  He's with Dr. Cora Dunkley who is on the faculty of the University of South Florida [Tampa, Florida] and your narrator, [HistoryMaker] Henrietta Smith.
Speaker 1: He sure is fine.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) He's got a girlfriend.  Oh, we don't need that do we?  I mean if you--
Speaker 1: (TAPE INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 2: This is a picture I took when I went to Robben Island in South Africa.  It's one of those memorable trips that you will not forget if you ever go there.  It's where Nelson Mandela was imprisoned for those sixteen years, and we actually went through the building and went to the cell where he was imprisoned for all of that time and those figures by the water fountain are actually to make it look like people from the imagination that they have.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Right here?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Go ahead.
Speaker 2: This is from my early days of storytelling and I'm telling the story of somebody that swallowed something very, very big with one big gulp.  Something that you couldn't imagine swallowing but he did and I can't remember what it was that he swallowed.  Oh, that was when the cat thought he swallowed the rat, but he hadn't swallowed the rat, but I won't tell you what he had swallowed 'cause that would spoil the story.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  He swallowed the cat?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) That's my mother on the beach.  As I said she was a domestic worker.  In the summertime she went to the beach to take care of these children.  I don't know where we were.  Somebody else was taking care of us but that's what my mother did.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  (Unclear).
Speaker 2: Her name was Nettie Mays [Nettie Johnson Mays]. Oh gosh, heavens knows when that was, very--a long, long time ago.  A very long time ago, 19--in the 1930s I would think, 1930s I would think when that was taken.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.
Speaker 2: These are three of my classmates when we went to Hunter College [New York, New York].  Hunter had an idea.  We could not go away to school and enjoy dormitory life but they had a campus up in the Bronx [New York] and the buildings were separated and it looked like the dorms that you would go to on a regular live in college campus and these are three of us up there.  This has to have been our sophomore year because you didn't go there as freshmen so I'd have to been our sophomore year in college.  I'm still friends with two of the people in that picture.  One of 'em I don't know what happened to but we're still friends with two of 'em. Oh, this one, I was signing one of the editions of 'The Coretta Scott King Awards Book' ['The Coretta Scott King Awards Book: From Vision to Reality,' Henrietta Smith].  We decided at first when we were twenty-five years old to do a book commemorating the award, and after that we decided every five years we would do another one and this is one of the five year periods.  We're now working on the 2009 edition, but this is--I'm signing the 2004 edition of 'The Coretta Scott King Awards Book' at the American Library Association.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Next, please?
Speaker 2: Oh this we were celebrating the book at the--it was a conference, a joint conference of librarians of color and we all went--some of us went to that.  The lady next to me is a former director of the African American Research Library, the lady on the other side of me is the current director, and the tiny lady closest to the book, Dr. Dunkley who's my colleague at the University of South Florida.  Again, telling stories.  I had a friend who worked in the public library--in the school library system in Broward County [Florida] and every May, the first of May I would go down and tell stories at her library and this was one of the annual celebrations.  I don't know what I was telling because I don't remember, but I'm telling something to the children at Hallandale School library [Hallandale Elementary School, Hallandale Beach, Florida]. (Laughter) This my daughter Cynthia [Cynthia Smith Jackson], I think she was in--were you in third grade or fourth grade?  Somewhere down there in the early, early school days.  You know those wonderful school pictures everybody takes (laughter).  I think your teeth had probably just come back you know something like that.
Speaker 1: Robin [Robin Smith]--we didn't--
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  I'm sorry can you say that again?
Speaker 1: This my son Robin, he had just come back from Camp Blue Star in North Carolina [Blue Star Camps, Hendersonville, North Carolina]--no, Camp Blue Star was basically a Jewish camp and he came back talking about he had to put on his yarmulke and say his grace and he knew--learned very much about the Jewish culture which I thought was wonderful for a young- youngster.  That's Robin Smith, he's now a policeman on the Delray Beach police force [Delray Beach Police Department].
Story_ID: 559036
Speaker 1: This is my daughter Cynthia [Cynthia Smith Jackson] a few years later when she graduated from New York Theological Seminary [New York, New York] in 19--2007. Taken for our church directory, that's my husband [Isiah C. Smith] who at this time was a county judge in Palm Beach County [Florida] system and my son Robin Smith who is on the Delray Beach police force [Delray Beach Police Department]. Literary conference in Delray Beach [Florida] and I was one of the mistress of ceremonies or facilitators.  In this picture you see Brian Pinkney, the son of the illustrator [HistoryMaker] Jerry Pinkney and Brian's wife Andrea Davis Pinkney.  Andrea was the one who invited me to write the introduction to the pictorial copy of the Negro National Anthem ['Lift Every Voice and Sing: A Pictorial Tribute to the Negro National Anthem,' James Weldon Johnson].
Speaker 2: Blue Water--
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  I'm sorry who is this?
Speaker 2: Blue Water, my Native American friend who lives on San Juan Pueblo [New Mexico].  Oh, it's interesting to know that they--Native Americans now are changing from the Spanish names to their Native American names and it's now Ohkay Owingeh pueblo [New Mexico].  She is the national treasurer in New Mexico and was just entered into the National Endowment of the Humanities [sic. National Endowment for the Humanities] as an honorary member.  She taught Tewa to the children so that they would not lose their Native American language.  Her name in Tewa is P'oe Tswa, and if you don't say it right you call it hamburger, but in--if you say it correctly it's Blue Water.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: Okay, the lady in the middle is [HistoryMaker] Effie Lee Morris who is a former New York Public Library [New York, New York] librarian.  When she moved to San Francisco [sic.], she did a lot of work for the Library for the Blind [Library for the Blind and Physically Handicapped; Andrew Heiskell Braille and Talking Book Library, New York, New York] and now they're having a petition out to get her entered into the American Library Association as an honorary life member, Effie Lee Morris in the middle of this picture.
Speaker 1: Oh, here I am talking to Charlotte Zolotow who was I think one of the most influential, influential children's writers that I met early in my career.  She understood what young children thought about and wrote books to incorporate ideas about their sensitivity.  The lady with the red scarf around her neck, Charlotte Zolotow she wrote to help them to understand what death was.  She wrote to help them understand what death was.  She wrote to help them understand about the fact that boys would become fathers therefore they should learn to play with dolls as well as they should with footballs, and trucks and other masculine things, and one of my favorite books is hers when a young child came, saw her sister would come to visit after she'd gotten grown and moved out and she noticed that when the sister came to visit that she didn't have to make her bed up on time and she could linger over a cup of coffee and she'd do all the things that grown people do.  So the little girl said to her mother at the end of the story, "When I grow up may I come to visit?" Because she--you did things differently from when you had to live in the house which is one of the things children observe, you know.  The lady on the right is George Craighead Jean [sic. Jean Craighead George] who is a naturalist.  She wrote her stories with concern for the environment even when it wasn't a big thing to think about.  So those are people that I knew along the way in my career. The lady in the white jacket is Tonya Bolden [HistoryMaker Tonya W. Bolden] who is one of your interviewees at some other time in this program.
Speaker 2: Who is Tonya Bolden?
Speaker 1: She's a writer, a researcher who writes.  She does her careful research.
Speaker 2: What's the relationship between you and Tonya Bolden?
Speaker 1: Well I met her through the Coretta Scott King Award and then we were together on a program in Minneapolis [Minnesota] a few years ago.
Speaker 2: And she's the person who recommended you for--?
Speaker 1: Yeah she's the one that sent my name in to be interviewed for this program. My telling in New Mexico.  I went to a lib- it wasn't--I guess it was a library, I don't know, some big building and they said there were gonna be a few children coming in and they kept coming and they kept coming as far back as you--even you can't see in the pictures there were children of all ages.  Usually my thing is I tell to thirty, thirty-five to kids at one time and I think I had a hundred in that room that day.
Speaker 2: And do you have a reason--I mean do you have a preference for thirty to thirty-five?
Speaker 1: I believe in eye contact when you're telling, and you can't have eye contact with a hundred kids.  When I go to a school I'll tell 'em, I will tell stories three different times with thirty kids rather than one time with ninety, and they say, "Won't you get worn out?"  I say, "I get out worn out with ninety, I don't get worn out with thirty, and thirty and thirty, and thirty." That's my--and I won't do it, I don't, but this was--they kept coming so you know once you're there you're stuck.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: For our twenty-fifth anniversary of the Coretta Scott King Awards we decided to do--first it was just gonna be a little brochure, then it grew into a bigger brochure.  Then it grew into a book ['The Coretta Scott King Awards Book: From Vision to Reality,' Henrietta Smith], so we celebrated the first twenty-five years.  The book went well and everybody liked it so then we decided every five years we would do another book.  This is the third one which covers 1970 to 2004.  We have biographical sketch of every winner, honor and new talent.  Color plates of the winning illustrators for that year and information about the history of the award and this is the--we're working now on the one that will come out in 2009 if all goes well.
