Story_ID: 473776
Speaker 1: Tell us a bit about your background. We're gonna start with, start with your mother. What was her name?
Speaker 2: Flossie Mack [Flossie Harry].
Speaker 1: Where was she born?
Speaker 2: In Barnwell, South Carolina. That's right outside of Charleston [South Carolina].
Speaker 1: Is that where she grew up?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: What do you know about her background as a child growing up?
Speaker 2: Very hard, very hard life. Think she only made it to seventh grade. Very, very typical for that era, you know. Grew up scrubbing floors, taking care of people. Then she became a nurse, nurse's aide and took care of us--was five children. You know, single--my father [Warren Perry] died early from alcoholism. And she just, you know, I understand it now that I'm older, but growing up I didn't quite, but she worked hard and she died very early at fifty-six years old. So had a very tough, tough life.
Speaker 1: You describe some great things about her being a hard worker. How else would you describe your mother?
Speaker 2: Like me--saucy, sassy, good-looking, highly flirtatious, could sing, very beautiful, loved me a lot--I was her favorite child, I know that. And--but very simple, not complicated.
Speaker 1: Did she share any stories with you about, about her life growing up or anything in particular, any particular stories that she ever told you about?
Speaker 2: No, no stories. I--my mother let me be with her. She would--she never brought any men home. She always stayed out or they, they didn't come in. She didn't allow that, which was very typical for that era as well. And--but we'd have parties, we'd go, and I loved seeing her dress up. She could dress. She was a sharp dresser. And she, she would let me hang out with her and her girlfriends. We--I play girl and mimic her. So I liked watching her dress, get dressed 'cause she was very good-looking. And she didn't tell stories--her, her sister Ruby [ph.], she was the storyteller. She was--they had different fathers so she was--had longer hair, more, more classically beautiful. She had the stories. She was the wicked girl.
Speaker 1: How many siblings did, did your mom have?
Speaker 2: Well, that she knew of, two. I think there were more, but her father would never say, my grandfather. I'm named after him. His name is Jack, Jack Mack [ph.].
Speaker 1: We're gonna come back to him.
Story_ID: 473777
Speaker 1: Now you said your father died early, but where was he born?
Speaker 2: In Winston-Salem, North Carolina, where I was born (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What was, and what was his name?
Speaker 2: Warren Perry.
Speaker 1: And he grew up in Winston-Salem?
Speaker 2: (Nods head) Big family.
Speaker 1: And do you know much about his background?
Speaker 2: No. He died when I was very young--eight or nine. I don't really have any memories. My sister [Brenda Free-Man] does, but I don't--and my brothers, I don't. But he had seven brothers and six sisters. All the men died of alcoholism (laughter). The women are ninety, ninety-one. You know, my grandmother's [Esther Perry] white, but she, you know, dallied, dallied with a black man [Arthur Perry], and she was black sheep. So, I'm just now learning a lot because I didn't really care to know, but now that I'm older I care to know.
Story_ID: 473778
Speaker 1: Let's talk about your grandparents. Let's start with the ones on your mother's side. Did you know your mo- did you know your, your mom's grandmo- I mean, mother and you know, her grandmother?
Speaker 2: We lived with my mother's mother. We called her Big Mama. We lived with her most of my early life.
Speaker 1: What was her real name?
Speaker 2: (Clears throat) Gosh, you asking me to go back--I gotta, I have to think about it. It's too early.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Big Mama (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Lucille Walters [ph.].
Speaker 1: Lucille Walters. Now, tell us about Lucille. How was she--you said you lived with her. Tell us about Lucille.
Speaker 2: Very mean, very evil to my mother [Flossie Harry]. Her other daughter, who was more classically beautiful, she, she favored 'cause my mother was darker and she was lighter. Very mean, very--the classic 'Raisin in the Sun' ['A Raisin in the Sun,' Lorraine Hansberry] mama, you know. But n- there was no soft center, not for us anyway, for, for her children on the other side, her, her favorite daughter and her husband [Jack Mack (ph.)]. She had her favoritism, but we still were allowed to live with her in Harlem [New York, New York] in a big apartment.
Speaker 1: Was there a grandfather present?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: And you mentioned on your father's [Warren Perry] side--did you know those people, the grandparents on your, or your gra--
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: Tell us about them, your grandmother first.
Speaker 2: Well, well, it's really the great-grandmother, Ma Perry. She lived--she just died at 103, with her memory still intact (laughter).
Speaker 1: Now she's the great-grandmother.
Speaker 2: That's the great-grandmother. Because in betwixt--in between--my family is split color-wise, which is really typical of the era I grew up in. And so I'm on the light skin side and there's the dark skin side. So they really didn't want to blend with my family 'cause it's mixed colors and people don't think that's--they don't get that. But I get it totally. You know, I don't, I don't feel that way. But I understand. So I really didn't have any connection with my, my--I had a connection with my father's mother, but we called her Ma Perry.
Speaker 1: Okay, and you said she was white?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And she had eight sisters and when you see them you can't tell the difference, but they went and passed. And she would, she refused to pass, you know, for them, because they had little bit of black blood in them. And she talked about it and they ostracized her to her death. They--'cause they were passing and she--they thought she would tell. You know, and in that time, you know, she a hundred--they--in that time you didn't reveal your ethnicity at all for fear of being, you know, you wouldn't have a life.
Speaker 1: So many people in that era who had that kind of mixture passed--
Speaker 2: On my side of the family passed--
Speaker 1: --passed over to the other side.
Speaker 2: So I have ancestors who would not even own up to it. And ev- if you'd pinned them down and shot them, they wouldn't admit to it, you know, because that's the way they think.
Speaker 1: Now how about your grandfather [Arthur Perry]. Do you recall any--
Speaker 2: I never knew him.
Story_ID: 473779
Speaker 1: Now what's your earliest memory growing up that you can recall, the earliest thing?
Speaker 2: Being in South Carolina. My mother [Flossie Harry] left me down south with her mother--her aunt, I'm sorry, Aunt Girlie [ph.]. Now that's really who I remember--Aunt Girlie. That was my mother's aunt. And she left me 'cause she couldn't take care of me as a baby.
Speaker 1: So it's your great aunt.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And she took my brothers, my sister [Brenda Free-Man]--she took them all with her up north to the city. 'Cause she couldn't take care of me, she left me down there quite a (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That being, that being--
Speaker 2: --quite a while.
Speaker 1: --that being New York--up north?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: New York City [New York, New York], so she could, you know make better wages. And she left me there a long time. And my f- with Aunt Girlie my earliest memory, fondest memory, is picking eggs out of the chicken coop from underneath the house. 'Cause the house was up on stumps and my job was to get up and get the eggs out the chicken coop. And you'd get pecked and everything. And I used to go in there--
Speaker 1: What city was this?
Speaker 2: Barnwell, South Carolina.
Speaker 1: Barnwell.
Speaker 2: Barnwell. See, some people say Barnsw- it's Barnwell. When I was growing up I used to say Barnswell. No, it Barnwell (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: And I used to go in my earliest memories picking those chickens out of there and getting plucked and pecked and, and my Aunt Girlie standing in the middle of road with one hand wringing a chicken's neck one morning. I was just fascinated. And I, and I remember--and I didn't wear shoes 'til I was nine.
Speaker 1: How old would you have been when you were picking these eggs out under the house?
Speaker 2: Six.
Speaker 1: Six years old. And little hens pecking back at you (laughter).
Story_ID: 473780
Speaker 1: And what was, what was life like in the house at that point with Aunt Girlie [ph.]? How was life as you recall? What, what, what the general tone?
Speaker 2: Stern, religious, Baptist. Get up, do your chores, go to school. I went to school across the street with no shoes. And I remember my feet hurting every time I walked across the road 'cause the rocks--as long as on, I was on grass it was fine. And on merry-go-r- the, the little thing we used to go--it's not a merry-go-round, but the thing you'd--the round, you know, thing we used to get on in the morning. Just really routine. But the best part of the day is playing with your friends, you know.
Speaker 1: So this'll be in, in the early to mid-'60s [1960s] we're talking about right now (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Your siblings, tell us about your siblings and, and their names and their birth- and the birth order that you--
Speaker 2: God, I don't know if I can give you all that m- must--too early--what time is it (laughter)? I have my oldest brother, Rudy [ph.]. He's older--he's the oldest. Ooh, god, you're asking--ooh, I can't even remember. Think. Let me just get them--Rudy, Miles [Miles Harry], Anthony [ph.], and Brenda [Brenda Free-Man]. I'm the, the youngest.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you're the baby.
Speaker 2: All Harry, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Now, which street did you live on in, in Barnswell?
Speaker 2: In Barnwell [South Carolina]?
Speaker 1: Barnwell, you--what street did you live on?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I don't remember that. That I don't remember. But we moved to, I moved to her--finally she--'cause she sent for me in Harlem [New York, New York] on 126th Street behind the Apollo [Apollo Theater].
Speaker 1: Let's talk about that now. Now, how old would you have been when you moved to--
Speaker 2: Not--about nine, nine, yeah.
Speaker 1: So now you got some shoes and you're on your--what, on your way to--
Speaker 2: And they hurt.
Speaker 1: --and you're on your way to New York [New York].
Speaker 2: The shoes hurt. Got there, um-hm.
Speaker 1: So you spent your first few years in elementary school down south.
Speaker 2: In Barnwell.
Speaker 1: Okay, now explain that little school to us. Explain--do you recall the name of the school?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: And were there any teachers there that, that were--
Speaker 2: I don't remember anything, you know, my memory--my sister remembers everything. I don't remember anything until I got to New York.
Story_ID: 473781
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Let's talk about the street you lived on in New York [New York]. Tell us again.
Speaker 2: 126th Street right behind the Apollo [Apollo Theater, New York, New York]. We used to sneak into the Apollo to see acts.
Speaker 1: Describe that neighborhood at that time. This would have been sixty-what, about '65 [1965]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was clean. It was different. There was no drugs, you know. Let's put--you know, the--everything, now that I look at in retrospect, everything started when the war in Vietnam years later, when heroin started coming to the neighborhoods. But we lived a clean life. If you worked for the post office, you had a good job. If you worked for (laughter), you know, if you worked for the government, you had a good job. And it was clean, it was American, you know, no, no violence of any kind. Stoop--sort of like when you see Spike Lee's movie 'Do the Right Thing,' 'cause just that kind of neighborhood. Just folk, you know.
Speaker 1: Who were some of the people in your neighbors- in your community that you can recall, your friends that were around there at that time?
Speaker 2: Alice [ph.] was my best friend. She lived on 131st Street (laughter). We went to school together. Laura Green [ph.], you know, I see them now, I can see them so vividly. It, it--I didn't stay in that school long. This is why I'm having trouble because--this is so silly. I got there and I took a test and they skipped me. Then I took another test and they cl- and they skipped me again.
Speaker 1: We're, we're gonna go forward to the schools in a moment.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Right, I could--so I don't, you know--I didn't stay long.
Story_ID: 473782
Speaker 1: All neighborhoods have a certain vibe to them. What are some of the sights and smells and sounds of 126th Street [New York, New York] at that time of, at that time of your life, that time of the century? What--
Speaker 2: The cookie store where they had pickles and pigs' feet up in the jars, and the fish and chip place next to it. And you would go in there and get your fish and chips in a bag and go hide in the hall so nobody would get none.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: Big fat cook at the big--fish and chip, cookies, was right in the front. You'd wave to him every day. The supermarket man, who was Jewish. The, the community, the--all the stores were owned by Jewish proprietors and operated by Jewish salesmen and service people. And the neighborhood was black and certain people worked in these stores. I mean it was down the line. There were maybe, not even a lot of bars. It was very pristine. Very safe, you know, very domesticated.
Story_ID: 473783
Speaker 1: Now it's mid-'60s [1960s] and things are, the civil rights thing is kind of heating up--
Speaker 2: Heating up (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) and things are really, you know, for--since the last ten years or so it's really been kind of a, a really trouble, tumultuous thing going on. What was New York [New York] like at that point? Basically, you were in Harlem [New York, New York] in your neighborhood, but what was the climate outside and what was the racial temperature at that time?
Speaker 2: Well, see, here's my problem. That's why I keep going forward. I was taken out of these schools early and I was taken again by a Jewish couple up in the Bronx [New York] because I passed twice--they skipped me. And my mother [Flossie Harry] didn't want to do it, she really didn't. And--
Speaker 1: So does that mean that--do you mean the school grades--
Speaker 2: Were above average.
Speaker 1: So you, so you went ahead a couple grades quickly.
Speaker 2: Immediately, yeah, and so this couple--I was--they wanted to, to put me in another school because the school was just not--I was just too way ahead, which we found out later, you know, I was--I mean it was no big thing to me, but they took me and they took me--eventually I started going to school in another district. So, you know, I was--what do you call it? Sheltered a bit, in another world. My head was in the clouds. I mean I'll admit it, I, I wasn't really--I was a little Negro, little, great little child. I wasn't, I really wasn't the--who I am today.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I really was--
Speaker 1: So let's back up to these schools. So you, you only spent a short time at, at--
Speaker 2: Short, I mean, a year there. Then I went to another school, P.S. 197 [John B. Russwurm School, New York, New York], which is no longer there. Then I went to another school. Then I went to Riverdale [Riverdale Girls School; Riverdale Country School, Bronx, New York], where I, I blossomed academically (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, so now was that a, was that a elementary or high--what, what grade level were you at that--
Speaker 2: Elementary.
Story_ID: 473784
Speaker 1: We're gonna come up to Riverdale [Riverdale Girls School; Riverdale Country School, Bronx, New York] in one moment, but now you, you come up from Winston-Salem [North Carolina], I mean, Barnswell (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Barnw- Barnwell [South Carolina] (laughter).
Speaker 1: Barnwell, right. Now all of a sudden you're here in, with your family and your mother [Flossie Harry], your other siblings.
Speaker 2: And I didn't fit in.
Speaker 1: And you--okay, tell us about that. How was life in the home at that point?
Speaker 2: Very, very rough. I got there and they beat me up every day 'cause I was like, "Hi (unclear), hi Rudy [ph.], how y'all do- ?"
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: They were like, you can't talk up in here like that kid, (makes noise). I mean, every time they gave me a quick--oh, they beat me up every day until I got rid of that accent 'cause I was country. "What's the matter with you gal?" (Makes noise) They used to call me kid and, or head, 'cause I, I don't have a forehead, I got a fivehead. So, it was brutal. I became very withdrawn, you know, 'cause I didn't understand what was going on, you know. But I was a strange little kid, I'm sure (laughter) (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So, academically, you were, you were excelling and so--
Speaker 2: But so was my brothers. Everybody was smart. But--they were real smart.
Speaker 1: Did, did they, did they get promoted also earlier?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, but, but they were really chemistry, math--I mean it just came to them--it still does. You know, it's funny. So they, but they'd been in the city, the big city, and, and, and boys are different. So they had the, the academic plus the city, so it really, you know, school was like Tupac [Tupac Shakur]--it means nothing. It's the, it's the hang, it's being popular. They were very popular.
Speaker 1: And your mom seeing all, seeing her children excel. Would you say, was she, was she with it, supportive of this, of this?
Speaker 2: Yes, whatever you want to do. But, we were latchkey kids. You know, we came home. She wasn't there. So we took care of each other and they took care of me 'cause--and (laughter) lot of adventures in the house (laughter).
Speaker 1: Tell us about a few of them. Tell us about some of the experiences.
Speaker 2: Like everybody else you, when your mother's not there, you tear that house up--play house, get the blanket and put the blanket up and get up under there and play house. And, you know, bring home the coffee--me and my sister [Brenda Free-Man] get her clothes out and be in her clothes, her he-highs--we didn't call them high heels, her he-highs and her makeup, her clothes. Oh, she was furious. Wigs, oh, we just tore it up. Ate all the food, messy, everything. And then we have to clean it up before three o'clock 'cause she, I mean, before she got home, before five o'clock. (Makes noise) You know, it was really wasn't clean enough, but tho- and my sister we'd look through magazines and copy 'cause my, my sister had great style and she taught me how to dress and act and talk properly 'cause I had this acc-, "You can't talk like that!" You know, so I became a very, in, in, in a dream world early.
Story_ID: 473785
Speaker 1: So you get to Riverdale School [Riverdale Girls School; Riverdale Country School, Bronx, New York]. Which--how old would you have been--the year approximately--
Speaker 2: About eleven.
Speaker 1: Eleven (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Somewhere in there, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I went there for a couple of years.
Speaker 1: Tell us about Riverdale.
Speaker 2: Very white (laughter). I mean, very--it's all about school. I didn't really--my, my teachers were my best friends, really.
Speaker 1: How many black--what, what was the makeup of this school--
Speaker 2: Two.
Speaker 1: You and who was the other person? Do you recall their name?
Speaker 2: Hector, Hector Ramirez [ph.], I said--but he was dark. That's it. But it was really--because academics--it had nothing to do with my personality or whatever. I mean, I don't think so, you know, so--but I did that for two years and then my mother [Flossie Harry] said, "Oh, no," 'cause I--
Speaker 1: Who were some of the teachers? You said they influenced you. Who were some of the teachers that were there?
Speaker 2: Ms. Luten [ph.], Ms. Ailene [ph.], different people, different--see, 'cause it--once she took me out, she brought me back. I went to a all-girls junior high school [Junior High School 136, Harriet Beecher Stowe Junior High School, New York, New York]. And that's where I began to connect sort of.
Speaker 1: And we'll talk about that momentarily.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: When at, at that school--now this family that took you in, did, did they just recog- how did you, how did you get connected with this family?
Speaker 2: But, well I didn't. I, I--you know, they just wanted--I was just smart and I loved to study and I loved to read, you know. And I loved to dream that I lived in a nice house. I wanted to be white, I guess. I didn't actively say that, but that's the way I thought. I really was ashamed at that point--I mean, this is all in retrospect or it wasn't, you know, 'cause I knew, I thought these thoughts when I was going up there. I felt good about living up there with them, you know.
Speaker 1: But the question what I was wondering--who, who were they and how did you meet this family in the Bronx [New York]?
Speaker 2: From these tests. You take them in school. And every time I passed, this teacher, she would take me, Weinstein [ph.]. And she would take me to each test and she just said, "Oh, well, you're just being wasted." She did it with a lot of kids; it wasn't just me, you know. I mean--
Speaker 1: Ms. Weinstein had this--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --had a vision for, she could see it--
Speaker 2: Yes, I don't want to talk about her because I, I really don't like her--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --because I felt she taught me--she taught, told me--she sh- she told me there were no black people in North Africa. I will never forget that. And that's when my mother sounds like--that's when I woke up, up. Getting back to what you said--these are the 1960s. Things are happening, so, yes, I was aware. And when she told me that I said how could there not be any black people in North Africa? That don't make no sense (laughter).
Speaker 1: North Africa, huh (laughter)?
Speaker 2: That doesn't make any sense. She said all white were in, the light skinned, were in North Africa and the dark were in South [South Africa]. It just was--I looked at her. A young kid--I was like that can't be true. Black people are all over Africa.
Speaker 1: So now you were living with them for a while and you all--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --explain that.
Speaker 2: Just for the school year.
Speaker 1: Explain that, that situation, how that--
Speaker 2: Well, it was closer to the school. And they let me stay up there in a room. But it wasn't just me. It was a, another child. And we'd go and then I'd come home on weekends. You know, sort of like being in a prep school because I needed the, the zip code to go to the school.
Speaker 1: So what was the, was the change? Like you--
Speaker 2: It was just her, though. She didn't have, you know, she didn't have any m- male--
Speaker 1: All week long you're, you're there with her--
Speaker 2: All week l- and this, this second--
Speaker 1: --and then on, and then the weekend you come back to, we'll call it reality.
Speaker 2: And they beat me up and--they wouldn't really physically, but I was, I was ostracized. I didn't fit in at all. You know, egghead and just kind of (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Did you feel like you fit in--
Speaker 2: --fat, kind of chubby.
Speaker 1: Did you feel like you fit in up kind of in the Bronx [New York], but not when--
Speaker 2: Oh, definitely.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Definitely. And I'm--plus I had long hair, light skin--I thought I was cute. I was conceited. You know, I don't know, I knew all these things, but who cares? That was what was happening then, you know (laughter).
Speaker 1: So what kind of student were you in the, in the school, in this particular school now?
Speaker 2: Studious.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Straight A's. Yeah, but I liked school. I loved school. I still do. I like, I like learning.
Speaker 1: What kind of child were you behaviorally? What--
Speaker 2: Very good. Never, I wasn't bad at all. I, I was, I didn't blossom 'til I was fourteen.
Speaker 1: Okay, so--but before you're fourteen, we'll say between ten and thirteen--
Speaker 2: I was boring, boring child. Just went to school, did my studies.
Speaker 1: Any dreams or aspirations at that time? Did you have anything you wanted to be or wanted to--you mentioned having the big houses and things.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I wanted to be normal. I wanted to just have things and not always be poor. But I, I didn't think in those terms, I just didn't want to be where I was. And my mother knew this, and it really--I hurt her, I know. But I really felt that way. She knew that, she knew.
Story_ID: 473786
Speaker 1: Did your family attend church when you went back on the weekend? Did--
Speaker 2: Yeah, with Big Mama [Lucille Walters (ph.)]. Oh, we used to hate it.
Speaker 1: Describe that experience (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's on 126th Street. That was the most important thing. I'm trying to think--Reverend Glendale [sic. Robert L. Glenn]. He ruled the house. He ruled your house. The reverend back then ruled everybody's home. That was the male in the house (laughter). I mean, you think about it. I mean, Sunday dinner you had to have him over. He ate first. You know, all of that. Ate, ate all--he, he eat up and then you get what's left. I mean--and I always wondered how many, you know, how many of the women he was with. But we used to have to go to church all day long, then go downstairs and eat, then come back up for Sunday school, then--it was just every Sunday and--
Speaker 1: What church was it or you can recall the name of the church?
Speaker 2: Glendale Baptist Church [New York, New York], okay?
Speaker 1: Named after him, huh?
Speaker 2: Yes. Right up the street. How could you not go?
Speaker 1: The church was named after the pastor, huh (laughter)?
Speaker 2: Okay? He--thin man, but charismatic. I still remember his face. It's funny 'cause memories, once you trigger a memory--
Speaker 1: So Reverend Glendale would come over and eat--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Eat in--
Speaker 2: I gots my suspicions about him. I know he's messing around. I'm not sure even with my moms [Flossie Harry] 'cause he was very, very much in our house--presence.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 473787
Speaker 1: You've gone to the Bronx [New York] and you've gone to school and it was Riverdale [Riverdale Girls School; Riverdale Country School, Bronx, New York]. Now it's time to go to junior high school now. You, you, you're thirteen, fourteen going to junior high. W- so what school is that?
Speaker 2: 136 (laughter), Harriet Beecher Stowe [Junior High School 136, Harriet Beecher Stowe Junior High School, New York, New York]. My sister [Brenda Free-Man] had gone there. And so I went for two years. And I got interested in plays, acting in that school (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Who were your friends there?
Speaker 2: Valjean Dean [ph.], Norvalla Nelson (laughter), Laura Green [ph.]--we, we hung out tough. But, again, what happened was I got there and I got some teachers that I absolutely adored.
Speaker 1: Who were some of those teachers?
Speaker 2: Hm?
Speaker 1: Who were some of those teachers?
Speaker 2: I can't remember her name. She taught French. I took French and I loved it--in ninth grade. I can't remember her name right not, but she was beautiful. She was, she wasn't French, but she was just beautiful. I can't remember her name. I loved her to death. And Ms. Prendagas [ph.], she taught English--loved, adored her. She--and she's still alive. I did a--what's that la- Ricki, 'Ricki Lake Show' ['The Ricki Lake Show'] and she showed up. I was in tears. And not because I was so glad to see her, it's just that she, she was my first teacher and she was black, who I connected with on a, you know, a level of, of learning. And we still have that, that connection. So that's where--and then I started hanging out with the teachers because they were teaching me things I wanted to know. And I hooked up with--I don't know his name--the musical person at the, at the school, and I got interested in mu- singing. And I stopped hanging out with my friends, and I started getting involved (laughter) with acting, you know.
Story_ID: 473788
Speaker 1: Singing in plays is starting to come into your life now.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So tell us about your first experiences and how all this came to you that you decided--
Speaker 2: They were doing the school play. They were doing 'Oklahoma' [Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II]. I was, I'd just gotten there. And, you know, I was good at--but they would not give me the main part of Curly [Curly McLain]. 'Cause it was all girls so you played all the males' roles as well. They would not give me that part 'cause they said it has to go to a senior, you know, the person that was there longer. And even though I was qualified definitely to do it, they would not--I was hurt. But the next year, which was my second year, they did 'The King and I' [Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II], and I got the King. And I did it. And we rehearsed and rehearsed and we did it that night. And I got a standing ovation and they stood up and they clapped and screamed so loud. And that's when I went, "I like this." I'll never forget it. But that was the beginning.
Speaker 1: Let's think about it. Now you said you say you were qualified for the part but you had had no acting lessons at that point or anything. You just felt that you were qualified for it.
Speaker 2: Now when I was at home--I'm leaving things out because you can't re- I can't remember it all sitting here, you know, 'less I had written it down. I used to rehearse at home with the radio singing.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: And my, my sister [Brenda Free-Man], my brothers, they, they said you--weird. I be- I mean, every day, you know, 'cause we didn't really have a T- the TV that we had, you know, you had the TV on top of the TV and (laughter) it would break then work. But the radio always worked and the records. And I would play them and I would rehearse along and sing along with the records--Aretha Franklin, the other, the other--
Speaker 1: For those that don't understand TV on top of the TV--
Speaker 2: --that I copied.
Speaker 1: --that's one TV with the sound, one with the picture (laughter).
Speaker 2: Leontyne, Leontyne Price until I got to a place where I could get training. And that--it began in junior high [Junior High School 136, Harriet Beecher Stowe Junior High School, New York, New York].
Speaker 1: So you would just, you would, you would turn the radio on and kind of just transcribe (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Sing along every day, all day. And then I watched TV. I made--and to--how to--I watched TV all day long. I Love Lu- all day long. I used to watch 'The Modern Farmer.' It used to come on at six a.m. People'd say--I would watch TV until I could not keep my eyes open. I was a TV baby.
Speaker 1: So does that--do you think those were influences by--on you like kind of subconsciously--
Speaker 2: Absolutely. All my comedy comes from 'I Love Lucy.' What's that ugly woman's name--I gotta think (laughter)--real ugly woman. Well, she got teeth--she played a maid, Gwendol [ph.], or something like that. I can't remember her name. You know if you saw her. She was really funny. All my comedy comes from these, these early shows with these, these white female comedians. I--it had no black role model.
Speaker 1: So in lieu of acting classes, you, you--
Speaker 2: I was mimicking.
Speaker 1: --you were teaching yourself.
Speaker 2: Yes, sucking it up like a sponge.
Speaker 1: By the time you got to school, you had a skill.
Speaker 2: It was in there, right.
Speaker 1: Okay, so 'Oklahoma'--you didn't get the main part.
Speaker 2: They told me, though, that you should have it, but they, they--
Speaker 1: Had to go to the senior.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: But next year, you--'King and I'--you're the King. Now I think at that point you had some--did you look at the Yul Brynner version?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: We come back (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I copied him.
Story_ID: 473789
Speaker 1: So you have a role as the King in 'The King and I' [Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II], one that was popularized by Yul Brynner. Did you go watch to see what he did?
Speaker 2: I watched that movie thirty times. I still love it. I copied him--everything, everything he did.
Speaker 1: Enunciations, everything (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Everything, everything. Song, (singing) "If my Lord didn't have a--" ["A Puzzlement"] they were screaming. I was just copying what I saw. But they stood up when I came out--'cause everybody took their curtain call. And my best friend, she was Anna.
Speaker 1: Her name was?
Speaker 2: Norvalla Nelson.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: N-O-R-V-A-L-L-A. She was named after her father, Norval [ph.], who was a very powerful influence in my life. Her father was like my surrogate. He's a pianist. And through her and her father and their, their--and her mother, Butch [ph.] (laughter), they let me, they--I went over their house every day. He had a piano and taught me how to play piano, how to sing--her father.
Speaker 1: His name is?
Speaker 2: Norval, Norval Nelson [ph.].
Speaker 1: Norval Nelson.
Speaker 2: She was named after her father, yes, and we studied every day. So we were able to study our parts at her house daily.
Speaker 1: Did this give you a sense of family? You felt like this was kind of--
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: --your family and--
Speaker 2: She lives in Silver Spring, Maryland, now, she and her mother. And their mother's name was Butch. Her real name was Ann [ph.], but she was Butch. This, this family influenced me to the point my mother [Flossie Harry]--I was always being carted off somewhere--white, black, whatever. But I never belonged where I was. And I always relate to Tupac [Tupac Shakur] that way 'cause I--people say why would he be a rapper when he was so smart? 'Cause he was very smart. He would--he was Bronx High School of Science [The Bronx High School of Science, Bronx, New York] because he wanted that more than what that was. I apparently wanted that kind of life. But now that I look back, if I had known, I would never have gone to Riverdale [Riverdale Girls School; Riverdale Country School, Bronx, New York] or anything. And, perhaps, I wouldn't be sitting here with you, you know.
Speaker 1: Exactly.
Speaker 2: But I would never have, you know, 'cause fitting in is important. It r- it really is when it is important.
Speaker 1: So the Nelson family, they're in a sense of almost a surrogate family--mother or--
Speaker 2: Everything.
Speaker 1: --or, or, or we'll it the--
Speaker 2: Their life, 'cause they lived in the Lenox Terrace [New York, New York], which was upscale. We moved from 126th Street to the Lincoln projects [Abraham Lincoln Houses, New York, New York]. That's where, that's where I really just got disconnected. But my brothers, my sister [Brenda Free-Man], all of--they connected 'cause they were older. They liked living in projects. The projects then were--you're still there in Harlem [New York, New York] on 135th Street. The projects were like a stepping stone to another place for--but back then it was no drugs. Like I said it was clean. It was a nice place to be, you know, very community-minded. And like you said, around mid-'60s [1960s] when the war started, Vietnam [Vietnam War], and people started coming back morphine addicts and drugs started trickling into communities--that's when everything disintegrated and that's when I was jettisoned out by, by entertainment.
Story_ID: 473790
Speaker 1: So you were hanging out with the Nelsons, getting trained, having, having a functional family life (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Hanging out with white folks all the time. You know, my whole life was different from what I was living at home. I'd just go home to sleep and I'd be gone.
Speaker 1: So you, so you do 'The King and I' [Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II] and you get a standing ovation--
Speaker 2: And I loved it.
Speaker 1: --screams, so the bug catches at that point.
Speaker 2: Bad.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: And it was the last day of school [at Junior High School 136, Harriet Beecher Stowe Junior High School, New York, New York]. You know, the end of school year so was going on. And I--this a powerful thing that happened to me, a turning point. We took a test for a performance arts school--me, Valjean Dean [ph.], my then best friend, Norvalla [Norvalla Nelson], quite a few other people--for the High School of Music and Art [Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music and Art and Performing Arts, New York, New York]. There was the Performing Arts [High School of Performing Arts; Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music and Art and Performing Arts, New York, New York], there was Juilliard [The Juilliard School, New York, New York], there was the Music and Art. There were quite a few schools, but you had to take a test--academic and performance-wise. So I took the one for Music and Art, the High School of Music and Art. And me--all of us--and we came back to school and we were sitting in the class and they were talking about who got in and, and they were congratulating my best friend, Norvalla, and Valjean. And, you know, they went on. And I was very disappointed that I didn't make it. And then they all left and my teacher came up to me. She says, "Congratulations." I said, "What?" She said, "You made it, too." I said, "Nobody told me." She said, "We always knew you would--that's why." And I'll never forget it 'cause even today I carry that with me. Even as we speak--'Damn Yankees,' I've never been had--nobody has to tell me that I'm good anymore 'cause they assume you're going to be. You know, I don't need a pat on the back.
Speaker 1: So now they, they didn't, they--it was just so that--it was assumed they--that you were going in. That's why (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's what she said--
Speaker 1: --there was nothing--there was no reason--
Speaker 2: I mean she said it with such a natural face. She said, "We always knew you would." And I, I'm going, "Somebody could have told me. I could have celebrated." 'Cause I was in class--I'm happy for them but I was like how come I didn't get it, you know, inside. And when she told me, I couldn't celebrate with them. She said--she told me--she said, "Never push it," she said, "'cause you're always gonna shine," she said. "Always pull back." And, you know, I, I've tried--we know I didn't succeed (laughter).
Speaker 1: Do you recall her name who told you about the school announcement?
Speaker 2: I'm gonna get it--Ms. Klemperer, K-L-E-M-P-E-R-E-R, Nancy Klemperer.
Speaker 1: So she told you--so basically she was teaching you a lesson just to relax (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And modesty.
Speaker 1: --at that point. She--
Speaker 2: Yeah, 'cause I was bit--I told you I was conceited. And she could see that.
Story_ID: 473791
Speaker 1: So you're going to a new school now. You're gonna go to the high school for performing arts [High School of Performing Arts; Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music and Art and Performing Arts, New York, New York] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Of Music and Art--no, Music and Art, the High School of Music and Art [Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music and Art and Performing Arts, New York, New York]. And there's Performing Arts, see, but Music and Art was up near City College [City College of New York, New York, New York] on 135th [Street] and Convent [Avenue] when I went to it. It's now down at Lincoln Center [Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, New York, New York]. But it was up there. And you're talking about twenty black students--that's it.
Speaker 1: Out of a mix of how many people, would you say?
Speaker 2: Fifteen hundred, something like that--very small amount. It catapulted me into another--I never--we say you can never go home again--I never could.
Speaker 1: So tell us about the, that experience there when you get there for the first time and you see--
Speaker 2: Total alienation. I had no--but that's, that's it for everybody when you go to high school, now that I've found out. But I didn't know anybody--I knew Valjean [Valjean Dean (ph.)] and Norvalla [Norvalla Nelson]. But Norvalla--and this was bad--her father [Norval Nelson (ph.)] got killed in a car accident before we went to school.
Speaker 1: Over the summer?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, right at the beginning of the semester when we're going in. And she--so she--we're up there a couple of days, he got killed. And her mother moved her to Silver Spring [Maryland]. And she married her first cousin, had two babies, gained two hundred pounds. Her whole--but her father predicted that. He said, "If something happens to me, I know just what's gonna happen to you." I mean, he knew it, and he was right. So she never got the experience, but she had made it. So me and Valjean went, and Valjean was an artist, I mean brilliant illustrator. And we went, but Valjean was a--she's the one where I got my character for, for Sandra. We'll talk about that later--Sandra Clark on '227.' 'Cause she had a allergy and she talked like this, (imitates) "Come on, Jack [HistoryMaker Jackee Harry], let's go. Hey, we did good." But she really talked like that 'cause that was blocked up. She never got the operation. And she was thin, dark-skinned. She didn't look anything like she sounded. But she was a bad girl. She was into all kinds of stuff. And we'd play hooky up there. She got me to cut, cut my first class. I remember my third grade [sic. third period] French class--she got me to cut. And I was, "I'm scared." We had a ball. And then she started dabbling in different, different substances, and eventually I got away from her 'cause, you know, that's the way I've always been. I don't let anybody bring me down. My, my mother [Flossie Harry] taught me that. Don't hang out with people that bring you down, you know.
Speaker 1: So you had to, you had to cut her loose a little bit.
Speaker 2: But she was definitely an influence on me blooming. I bloomed at age sixteen. Fourteen, fifteen--I was just a little, you know, student--little, you know, whatever, egghead. But sixteen--I became a really, really interesting young lady (laughter).
Speaker 1: So you're, you're in high school and it's a great school now, and you're starting to experience, we'll say life a little bit through, through Valjean (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Still a virgin, though--
Speaker 1: --you're, you know, through Valjean.
Speaker 2: --but I met my first boyfriend at Music and Art, Manny Cabrera [ph.].
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Manny.
Speaker 2: He's in Barbados now. He's got a great restaurant. Manny Cabrera taught me everything I ever wanted to know about sex.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) We'll go to him in a minute.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: Who were your teachers?
Speaker 2: Oh, gosh, woo, you should have told me before I came in. I can't think this early in the morning. Well, Mr. Baker [ph.] was the gym teacher--wait a minute now, you are making me--I gotta go back. Sybil, Sybil Mandel was the music director of the entire school. She was major. She, she had all the power. I have to remember these other names as we go--it'll come to me. But it was all white teachers.
Speaker 1: Sybil Mandel.
Speaker 2: The only black teacher was my gym teacher, and he was fine, oh, he was gorgeous.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: Major crush on him--all the girls did. Richard Klein was the pres- principal, hated him. 'Cause what we're gonna get into is what you said. High school is where I got in trouble because of the Civil Rights Movement. And we got into the whole black thing, you know, the black school student movement, all of that was raging. You know, these kids these days don't have a clue.
Speaker 1: So, so what year would that have been when you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) But Manny Cabrera--
Speaker 1: --when you got into high school.
Speaker 2: --did all of that.
Story_ID: 473792
Speaker 1: What year would you have been in high school [High School of Music and Art; Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music and Art and Performing Arts, New York, New York], in, that about 19- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) What grade?
Speaker 1: What year would we say it was, about 19--
Speaker 2: Oh you, ooh, god you, you ask--
Speaker 1: Late '60s [1960s].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Late '60s [1960s].
Speaker 2: You know, really right there, yeah, right at the turn, right after 1968, right there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So now do you recall Dr. King's [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] assassination?
Speaker 2: You know, I'll tell you the truth--yes. But I knew it was gonna happen. 'Cause I knew what he was doing. You know, I knew--we all knew. I recall President Kennedy's [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy] assassination. It hit me harder than Martin Luther King's.
Speaker 1: Really, but--now you were really young--
Speaker 2: I'm talking about as a child, yes.
Speaker 1: You were a real young child at that point.
Speaker 2: But I, I really cried--like everybody. And I don't know if it was for hope 'cause I wasn't that politically a- aware, apparently, but just the sadness of having that happen. And then, then Robert Kennedy [Robert F. Kennedy]--I mean it was just, it just kept--seemed to keep going.
Speaker 1: It's really interesting because with President Kennedy you would have been like seven, eight years old. And you would--you had felt that at that point (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, but in school I remember I had to--we had our heads down, we're--'cause it happened and I had my head down on the--we were taking our nap 'cause they made you take naps then. You had your little cookies and milk and, and they came in and told us. And we just boohooed. Well, you loved your president then. You know, you pledged allegiance. You--it was America, it wasn't--that civil rights thing started later when--you know, it's like--and nobody really knew what it was except we weren't allowed to go to school. That's in--you know, they didn't let us in school. And, you know, in, down there in Little Rock [Arkansas]. It's really what has catapulted--not, not the feeling of unequalness--to me.
Story_ID: 473793
Speaker 1: So, you're in high school [High School of Music and Art; Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music and Art and Performing Arts, New York, New York] now. You're sixteen and Norvalla's [Norvalla Nelson] not doing that well because her father [Norval Nelson (ph.)] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) She's gone.
Speaker 1: She's gone.
Speaker 2: So I--she's no longer--
Speaker 1: She's gone and--
Speaker 2: --and I miss them terribly.
Speaker 1: --and Valjean [Valjean Dean (ph.)] is--
Speaker 2: My main--
Speaker 1: --and, and, and we'll say, as we say--
Speaker 2: But they fought over me, she and Norvalla--
Speaker 1: --we'll say now--
Speaker 2: --for my friendship.
Speaker 1: --she was on one, as we'll say, Valjean had got on one. So she was doing her thing. So you had to cut her loose.
Speaker 2: She was wild.
Speaker 1: Now Manny Cabrera [ph.], where does he show up at? At what--where did he show up?
Speaker 2: I was in tenth grade--'cause ninth grade was--just went by. I don't know what happened. I, I went to school and that was it. But tenth grade--maybe three days in school, I was sitting in my third period class. Trying to figure out what it was--I think it was history, American history. And I'm sitting in the front. I had on a gray outfit--I know I was looking cute. And, so we get up, you know, the b- the bell rings and you go on to the next class. But before I could go, I was getting up getting my stuff and this boy comes up. He's the cutest boy in class. He sat in the back. And he never studied, but he knew everything--just smart, brilliant--and always making trouble. He had big Afro, gorgeous. And I saw him but, you know, hey. And he came up. He said, "How you doing?" I said, "Fine." It was just like out of school--clueless. And he said, "You look good. Can we talk for a minute?" Real sophisticated. But he was Cuban. His mother was Cuban, very dark Cuban, and his father was a white Cuban. So he was a mixture of them. But he was very bright. She had raised him to be politically aware. She had, she was very, very dark-skinned woman, kind of heavy set, short hair. She was a--bangles, you know, she was a, she was really the beginning for me. I could never imagine anybody being that radical when met her. Her name was Jean [ph.]. She was just so fantastic, you know, when I met her. And then his father was this light, light, light Cuban--totally Cuban. And his mother was very independent. And he's just like his mother, he and his sister. I mean, and she raised them to be very--and he's--I met this young man, and he basically turned me out (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I mean with, with knowledge, with sex--like I said, that was my first sex- it took a while though. But he was very calm. He said--'cause he'd been with girls. And he was very patient. He said, "You'll get it." He said, "It takes a minute." I mean, he really, he was very patient 'cause I was so upset. I was so inadequate 'cause I was scared. But he waited and waited, sneaked some wine from somewhere, Twister or whatever that other one was. I mean it was a long--it took, it took him maybe couple of weeks.
Speaker 1: Well, he was cool. Manny was cool.
Speaker 2: He had already had sex. He wasn't--he--we weren't together for that reason he told me. Became, we became boyfriend and girlfriend.
Speaker 1: So let's talk about the--him telling you about the racism and the political aspirations and being involved in that.
Speaker 2: He, he told me, "You're a dummy." And when I was living in Harlem [New York, New York] I wouldn't let him go home with me 'cause I was ashamed for him to come home with me 'cause he lived out near the Village [Greenwich Village, New York, New York], you know, great, great place and, and finally he said, "What is it with you?" He says, "This, this is what you are. You're a black person." I said, "No, I'm not; I'm colored." He says, "No, you're not." (Laughter) He says, "You're black, and this is what we have to do--we have to fight." I took up the cause with him, I mean, immediately. And this is right after, this is right after [HistoryMaker] Angela Davis--that's why we'll go back chronologically when--what's his name--George Jackson, his brother--all of that stuff was happening, you know.
Speaker 1: This is early as late '60s [1960s], early '70s [1970s].
Speaker 2: You know, so it's like--I, I'm caught up, you know. But with this young man influencing me--and, of course, the times. I'm not gonna lie--it wasn't just him. The fact that we couldn't do certain things in school--you know, we couldn't have our own play. They had a white play but we couldn't have a black play. I mean, we got, we almost got suspended from school for all of this stuff.
Speaker 1: Okay. Tell us about this. Now you're getting information and you're starting to feel the fight the power come on.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So what's going on with you now that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Cutting my hair, got a Afro. My mother [Flossie Harry], about went nuts. My Afro was out to here (gesture), 'cause I had long, you know--I, I still do, believe it or not (laughter). Really, and, and, you know, all of that. I went left. I got pictures--bellbot- I mean just shimmy--I--just what, what happened? She was--I don't know what happened. But it happened quickly.
Speaker 1: And what were you talking about? What was your speech like in, in, in your speak now--
Speaker 2: (Gesture).
Speaker 1: --at this point--right on?
Speaker 2: Yeah. We all were. It was, it was sort of a fad, if you think about it. But it was real. I mean, 'cause we, we were that. But, when he shot--when Jonathan Jackson got shot before his brother, then George Jackson got shot, and a series of things--Stephen Biko [Steve Biko]. I mean, it just, it began to be real. It, you know, it really began to be like you can get hurt. And you better believe in it. And he believed in it. Manny believed in--he was a real revolutionary. He wasn't--I was kind of fake, you know. He was, he was real. But he was knowledgeable. He wasn't a dummy.
Story_ID: 473794
Speaker 1: So now you're in school. Now how is your new, your new attitude affecting you with teachers, the principal [Richard Klein] you mentioned earlier?
Speaker 2: No, I still went to school. I had straight A's. No, yeah. Nobody could deter me. And so did he.
Speaker 1: But did you become an activist at the school?
Speaker 2: Yes. And they threatened to suspend all of us. It was a quite a few. It was me, [HistoryMaker] Nat Adderley, Jr.--he used to play with Luther Vandross, Buddy Williams, quite a few of us, you--who are, have made it, you know, in terms of the business. And we--
Speaker 1: So you all, you all were there in this little--
Speaker 2: And we were like this. But we were tal- we had straight A's and we were tal- they--Sybil Mandel stepped in and said and told the principal, "Oh, for god's sake." She said, "Can't you see they have a cause?" She said, "What does that have to do with academia?" She said, "Pass them all and graduate them." And that's just what he did. I'll never forget. And then Mrs. Ext [Anna Ext] was the assistant under her. She taught all the arias. I studied to be an opera singer at Music and Art [High School of Music and Art; Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music and Art and Performing Arts, New York, New York]. That's what I got in for.
Speaker 1: Classical music.
Speaker 2: Yes. I was gonna be like Leontyne Price.
Speaker 1: A classical voice student.
Speaker 2: I had studied, I studied voice eight years. I was going to be a mezzo-soprano.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: Yes, until I, I realized what I had to do, that I couldn't sustain that kind of discipline.
Speaker 1: So were you, were you a star, a star among stars in the school at that point?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Tell us about your experiences. You, now--but this is a school that had--
Speaker 2: Best, best time of my life.
Speaker 1: --this school has a lot of great people at it.
Speaker 2: Great.
Speaker 1: But you're still rising to the top.
Speaker 2: You know who had graduated before me was Laura Nyro. I don't know if you know her, (pronunciation) Laura Nyro some people say. She, she passed of cancer about couple of years ago. Great things--she wrote 'Stoned Cold Picnic' [sic. 'Stoned Soul Picnic'] and a whole, a whole bunch of songs. She was, she sort of preceded this whole sound that you hear today--April Lavigne [sic. Avril Lavigne], all of th- she had that--
Speaker 1: Back then.
Speaker 2: Yeah, you know.
Speaker 1: Nat, Nat Adderley, Jr.--
Speaker 2: She, she was an original.
Speaker 1: You mentioned Nat--I know Nat--he--his father, his father [Nat Adderley] and uncle [Cannonball Adderley], uncle were legends. Up at that point they were legends, Cannon--
Speaker 2: And he was a genius when I went--he was already there when I got to the Music and Art. He was a genius then on the piano. And there were people there that could hear something and repeat it on the piano. Tiny [ph.], I don't know where she is. I know she's working. I talk to her on the phone. Just a--like you said a star among stars--but I didn't know it. They didn't know it either. You were--we're just doing our thing. But I met a woman there--well, it's a woman now, but I met wo- a girl there who really set me on the path to acting. Her name was Lynn Pannell [ph.]. She's still alive. And she--dark-skinned--she was another sister had short hair and she was a upperclassman, heavyset. She was in the drama department and she said, "Why don't you come down to acting workshop with me?" That's how she talked. "Why don't you come down to acting workshop with me one day after school?" I said okay and I went down to the Henry Street Settlement, Lower East Side [New York, New York], with her after school. And I never stopped. I went down there four years and never--with my first teacher who I fell in love with, of course, but--
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) that's when it, that's when you--I was unreachable.
Story_ID: 473795
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So you're in high school [High School of Music and Art; Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music and Art and Performing Arts, New York, New York] now and you're going to these little workshops afterwards [at the Henry Street Settlement, New York, New York]. You're going--
Speaker 2: After school.
Speaker 1: That's the hang now.
Speaker 2: Taking four trains.
Speaker 1: Wow. That's the hang now.
Speaker 2: [HistoryMaker] Woodie King, Jr.'s play. That's the hang.
Speaker 1: It's called what now again? Woodie King--
Speaker 2: The Henry Street Settlement [New York, New York]. Woodie King, Jr. was the, you know, the, the director of the Henry Street Settlement.
Speaker 1: So Lynn Pannell [ph.] took you down there because I guess she saw--
Speaker 2: Artistic director.
Speaker 1: --she saw that you were--she must have seen that you had some talent also.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So you can sing and act now.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So now you go down here. What, what happens, what happens at the workshop?
Speaker 2: Nothing. We get down there--Dick Anthony Williams, I don't know if you guys have done him, but you should. He played 'The Mack,' in 'The Mack' he played Pretty Tony, you know, the one that gets blown up in the chair. Like, you, "Can you see grown folks talking?" You know that line (laughter). He was a teacher, and he and his wife Gloria Edwards, they ran the acting workshop. And it was free. And he was doing it. And I was like why not? Got down there, Taurean Blacque was there. He was on 'Hill Street Blues.' A lot of people--Pam Grier. I'm talking about tons--[HistoryMaker] Robert Hooks.
Speaker 1: All this great star power.
Speaker 2: But--yeah.
Speaker 1: But at that time not necessarily all the way in yet.
Speaker 2: Right, not famous.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Right, but they were acting--at the Negro Ensemble Company [NEC], at various places--'cause they had [HistoryMaker] Ed Bullins, Doug Turner Ward [HistoryMaker Douglas Turner Ward]. They were doing all these great things. It was the beginning of a great era. So I came down there. Nothing happened. I just came in and watched and listened and studied and read and--he couldn't get me to--I did all the exercises--he couldn't get me to get up and do, you know, a monologue or a scene with anybody.
Speaker 1: Why, you froze?
Speaker 2: I was so shy, so scared.
Speaker 1: But you had been--you had done some things now--had applause, had the buzz.
Speaker 2: Yeah, but that was then. Now I made the transition. I'm goofed off, had sex (laughter), I mean, you know, it's like got distracted.
Speaker 1: Activist.
Speaker 2: Yeah (laughter), you know, I'm, I'm everywhere, which was great but got down there and I was concentrated. And people were getting up and they were great. I wasn't equal to them, and I didn't want to be embarrassed. So finally he put his foot down. He was like, "No, you're getting up. Everybody--come on, come on." I got up, did a scene. They couldn't get me down after that. They, they were like, "Okay, it's not your turn now."
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: Just like before. Once I got going, you couldn't--it's like, unh-uh--I--(unclear). No, I was all of that and a bag of chips. But we're talking about gorgeous, gorgeous people--Debbi Morgan, she's on 'All My Children,' I'm ta- Glynn Turman--I'm talking about sensational-looking people, not, not, you know, slouches.
Speaker 1: Who are on the brink of their own thing and maybe not--
Speaker 2: Debbie Allen, you know, and--
Speaker 1: And they're all right there.
Speaker 2: --and they all, they all were there before me waiting to do they thing.
Speaker 1: 'Cause a few years later, most of them had kind of kicked in in certain things, wow.
Speaker 2: You know.
Speaker 1: So all this, all this --
Speaker 2: And people were ahead of me had--what's his name--Clifton Davis was at The Public Theater [New York, New York] doing 'Two Gentlemen of Verona' [John Guare and Mel Shapiro]--way ahead, light years ahead. So you--this is what you had to come up to. I was waiting in the wings.
Speaker 1: So you felt this bug again now.
Speaker 2: Oh, serious.
Story_ID: 473796
Speaker 1: So high school [High School of Music and Art; Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music and Art and Performing Arts, New York, New York] is getting ready to come to a close soon, and you're, you're getting ready to leave high school and graduate from high school (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, but in tenth grade I got a play, I got in a play. It's called 'Run, Children, Run!' [William Harvey Keith] at the--
Speaker 1: Tell us about it.
Speaker 2: --at the Henry Street Settlement [New York, New York]. They gave me a part in a play. I only had two lines. My name was Mae [ph.]. I had four lines actually, you know. And--
Speaker 1: You still have the four lines--
Speaker 2: Mostly white--
Speaker 1: --do you still have those four lines?
Speaker 2: That's right. And the teacher--
Speaker 1: Can you say those for us, the four lines?
Speaker 2: I'm trying to think. It was like, "Oh, no, she didn't. Well, the teacher said that we could do it! Well, let's go!"
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: I mean, it was--but I did them good they said. And they gave me another part in another play. 'Cause they did a play every twelve weeks, it's--
Speaker 1: So in tenth grade now you're acting in, in--
Speaker 2: After school.
Speaker 1: --in a, in a, in a semi-professional setting.
Speaker 2: I got paid $60 for four performances--you're darn tooting. And I also had a job that I went to--I was very busy, see.
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: I had a job at what they called HARYOU [Harlem Youth Opportunities Unlimited - Associated Community Teams, New York, New York]. I don't know if you ever--Harlem Youth, they, they used to give stipends and you go and do a, a certain amount of work for three or four hours and you'd get a stipend. So I was making $59.58 from that.
Speaker 1: So you had some money in your pocket in the tenth grade.
Speaker 2: But they had things provided to you, you know--nowadays they don't. And I took, kind of took that for granted.
Speaker 1: So what was your family saying, you know, because you're, you're not even, you probably--
Speaker 2: I'm not there at all and neither are my siblings, though. These--this was a time of tremendous movement in terms of black, black African American people because we, we were just busy, now that I look back on it. It's a lot going on--we were like sort of blossoming as a people into our own avenues, you know. We're creat- creating tremendous, tremendous opportunities for a lot of people. And I was taking full advantage. That whole generation, which is now to me almost disappearing to me.
Speaker 1: So you're a, you're a youngster at, at the settlement, you know, in the workshop. We'll say some of those, some of those people were ten to fifteen years your senior maybe, some of those people. And you're hanging out as a young one with them. Do you recall any particular conversations with, say, a Pam Grier or, or, or a--
Speaker 2: Unh-uh.
Speaker 1: --someone? Do you recall any--
Speaker 2: But I got very close to Dick Anthony Williams and his wife Gloria [Gloria Edwards], very close, Taurean Blacque, Oba- Obacha Underter [ph.], Loretta Devine.
Speaker 1: So all these great black actors were all in New York [New York].
Speaker 2: Very close, we had a click. And my sister [Brenda Free-Man] was there, too. She took acting lessons for a while. She opted out and got real job (laughter). But she said she di- she wonders if she did the wrong thing. I'm trying about--but it was, no, became a very tight--Kirk Kirksey was a great actor, Adolph Caesar. We're talking about a strong group. So they were older, but I always hung out with older people, you know, old soul (simultaneous).
Story_ID: 473797
Speaker 1: So you're there and high school [High School of Music and Art; Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music and Art and Performing Arts, New York, New York] coming to a close now. So what is Jackee [HistoryMaker Jackee Harry] thinking she wants to do now?
Speaker 2: Become a teacher. I had a dream of becoming a teacher and getting a check every--and becoming a teacher for the rest of my life.
Speaker 1: So acting was just some--
Speaker 2: I got my teacher's certificate, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: So acting was, acting was some- something you would--thought about you could always do kind of as a avocation.
Speaker 2: I got, I got a scholarship to college.
Speaker 1: Okay, which school was that?
Speaker 2: Long Island University [Brooklyn, New York]. I got a Martin Luther King Scholarship [Martin Luther King, Jr. Scholarship]. Okay, a full scholarship--four years. And I--
Speaker 1: Now how did that happen? Did you take a test for it or did you--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --write an essay?
Speaker 2: You had to have certain grades, yep, that's right.
Speaker 1: So now there's this, there's this academistic--you know, you're very academic and you're--
Speaker 2: Very.
Speaker 1: But, but it's not a hassle for you. It's pretty easy for you.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Then you have this talent also.
Speaker 2: Right, which was pretty easy.
Speaker 1: Pretty easy also.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: You--well, you knew that you really didn't want to study classical because it's not--it was easy but--
Speaker 2: I couldn't sustain.
Speaker 1: But you knew that it took a lot of work that you didn't want to do.
Speaker 2: That's right. I wanted to party, um-hm.
Speaker 1: You wanted to hang out. So you respected what that would have taken in order to do that. So that's why you chose--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, so you get a Martin Luther King Scholarship at the University of Long Island.
Speaker 2: Long Island University at the Brooklyn center.
Speaker 1: And that's a serious school at that point.
Speaker 2: Yes, and I had to commute and go all way--and I was living with my sister [Brenda Free-Man] at this time and she lived in the Bronx [New York]. I was staying with her 'cause her husband had been shipped off to the war [Vietnam War] and she was alone. And he got killed and she had--she got pregnant. So I stayed with her. It was a tumultuous--woo.
Speaker 1: How was that experience because now you're in--
Speaker 2: Horrible for her. I didn't feel it. I wasn't connected. Like I told you, I, I was connected through knowledge, not through feeling.
Speaker 1: But you were living there with her. Were you part of like maybe almost a counselor for her or sort--
Speaker 2: (Shakes head) No.
Speaker 1: --a sort of a, of a--
Speaker 2: She always wrote me. Once she told me everything. She let me hang out with her. That's probably why I hung out with older people 'cause she's four years older.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so I, I learned a lot quick. You know, I was a pretty mature kid.
Speaker 1: Plus you, you were preoccupied with what it is you were doing.
Speaker 2: Yes, and sh- and I was a good, responsible young adult--getting into, not trouble, but just living, you know.
Speaker 1: So you're in college now. You've gone to college and--
Speaker 2: First year was boring, just like high school--nothing happened.
Speaker 1: And you're not really into the acting thing because you're trying to be a teacher.
Speaker 2: And I'm getting my act- my teacher's certificate while I'm there. And it's going great.
Speaker 1: Who were some of the people there in school with you?
Speaker 2: I, I don't remember. Another Ms. Weinstein [ph.], though.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: I hated her, too.
Speaker 1: There's always a Ms., Ms. Weinstein.
Speaker 2: I began to teach, yeah. I began to teach. She used to take me under her wing and went next door where I eventually got my teaching certificate for the boys high school [Brooklyn Technical High School, Brooklyn, New York] there.
Speaker 1: Because it only, it only took how long? Did it take the full four years--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --or two years to go this--
Speaker 2: Four.
Speaker 1: So, see, you spent your four years there.
Speaker 2: But I began to act (laughter).
Speaker 1: During that time period?
Speaker 2: Yes. Next door they had a, a theater [Kumble Theater, Brooklyn, New York]--I can't think of it right now. And I used to go over there and do some of their shows. They asked me as a favor 'cause they'd heard that I could act 'cause I was still taking acting classes at the Henry Street Settlement [New York, New York].
Story_ID: 473798
Speaker 1: So you're becoming the teacher--because you, you really did admire teachers. Most of your teachers were your friends coming up. But you still got your little acting thing going on the side as we say--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --at the Henry Street Settlement [New York, New York] 'cause that's where your friends were.
Speaker 2: That's right, and I went to a lot of other workshops, not just there. I went to [HistoryMaker] Bill Duke's, great actor, he had a workshop and Negro Ensemble Company [NEC], they had a workshop. I went--I kept it up.
Speaker 1: So you're doing that. So they asked you to be in this production. Who asked you?
Speaker 2: 'Dark of the Moon' [Howard Richardson and William Berney], Sister Metcalf [Miss Metcalf].
Speaker 1: Who asked you?
Speaker 2: The, the director. It was right next door to the Long Island University [Brooklyn, New York]. I'm trying to think--it was in a church, and they had all the plays there. But it was, it was from the Long Island University drama group, but they performed them right next door. And they said could you do us a favor? It wasn't a big part--Sister Metcalf. But I said, okay. And I did it for them. And I got good reviews (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yeah, because now you're in New York [New York] and then the reviews are coming in for you.
Speaker 2: Yeah, but I didn't expect for that little part, you know. That's what taught me there are no small parts.
Speaker 1: So you, so you're in school--so, so now it's--you're just ready to graduate from, out, out of college and teach.
Speaker 2: Yeah, to teach at the Brooklyn Technical High School, which is down the way in Brooklyn [New York], boys, American hist--
Speaker 1: And, and did you do that?
Speaker 2: Yes, for a short time. I didn't last.
Speaker 1: So it was, so it's an all-boys school?
Speaker 2: All fresh. I was cute. Oh, I hated them.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Tell us about that experience, Jackee [HistoryMaker Jackee Harry] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I remember them--horrible, horrible. And I, I knew that they would--you know, you know, it's like that movie 'Dangerous Minds.' It's like once you get over it--and people don't get this. Okay, it's like, oh, you're very handsome. You'll go, thank you, and we press on, right? I, I mean.
Speaker 1: But, but they couldn't get over it.
Speaker 2: Boys? Snakes and snails and puppy dog tails. I--they were so fresh--smart, bright. I remember one young man, John [ph.], he was--I don't even know his last name. I wonder what--you know, cer- certain people you wonder what happened to them 'cause he was bright, just charming. And, and not precocious or anything, but he had some buddies. They were just--and all of them--this was a special boys school. They were all bright. But--and mixed, but very, very fresh (laughter).
Speaker 1: And you're a young teacher.
Speaker 2: Gorgeous, yeah.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: And I, I--you know, when I got there I said, "Y'all gonna give me some respect." And they were like, "Um-hm, you still fine," you know. But they were, they were all right. They weren't really, you know--they weren't that bad.
Speaker 1: Well, they still understood even though in those days--was there still a respect that you are the teacher and they understood?
Speaker 2: Yeah, and you have to carry yourself in a certain way. But, that didn't make no difference (laughter).
Speaker 1: So how, so how long did you stay there?
Speaker 2: Two years. I left two semesters--barely. I got, I kept getting acting gigs. I mean they just kept coming. I couldn't, I couldn't--I realized that I was gonna--I had to make a decision. Was I gonna teach or was I gonna act?
Speaker 1: How did you enjoy teaching?
Speaker 2: Oh, I love it. I still do. I love seeing me communicate to someone something and they get it. That's the best feeling. Even now, you know, I get very frustrated if I don't communicate and get my point across. I mean I just--I'm--play I'm doing now I was giving Cleavant Derricks notes. I went, what am I doing giving you notes? Get my act together. But it's a teaching thing. It has nothing to do with, you know, being right.
Story_ID: 473799
Speaker 1: So, you're, you're, you decided that now--what--was there, was there a big play or a big part on the horizon that, that really said, you know what, I can't do both of these?
Speaker 2: I got two jobs, two choices. And I could do one and teach or, or I could do both and I decided then and there I had to make a decision. So I quit teaching.
Speaker 1: And what, what were these two acting jobs?
Speaker 2: One was at the--great playwright Richard Wesley, it was at the Brooklyn Academy of Music [Brooklyn, New York]. It was a musical, but it was a small part. And the other part was taking somebody's place in another play at--I'm trying to think of the theater--just for two nights though. But it was like on a level of, a professional level that I had never been, you know. And I wanted to, to do it--I was her understudy. And then eventually--now this kind of convoluted. What happened was, I did those parts and they were small. But then I got a job being a dresser for one of the plays for somebody, you know, which is you dress them in their costumes. And I was so good at it--do you know I was recommended to, to a Broadway person to be on Broadway to dress. Okay, you're ready?
Speaker 1: Now, now let's hold right there for a moment. Now, now here's (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, this is--this took a turn.
Speaker 1: --here's a person who could be academic--you could teach if you wanted to. You can sing, which is outside--you could have been a, a nightclub singer, singing, doing all sorts of things working in that industry. You could also act. Now, in knowing that how we, we say, put our hustle on. You were only doing the dressing thing 'cause it was, it was, it was another gig for you.
Speaker 2: But it was for--this is for Stephanie Mills. Do you know who that is?
Speaker 1: Of course.
Speaker 2: To dress her.
Speaker 1: On Broadway in which play?
Speaker 2: 'The Wiz.'
Speaker 1: Now let's talk about this.
Speaker 2: This is the turning point of my life in terms of my character development.
Speaker 1: What year would this have been?
Speaker 2: They started in 1973, so I joined them when they got to Broadway, 19--I want to say early 1975, something like that, 19--something like that, something. They were already--they had already done it.
Speaker 1: So now you got a job as a dresser prior to this, this particular position. You really had, you had probably just seen it done. You probably had no real experience or desire to really do it.
Speaker 2: No, I did it 'cause I was good at it. And I was young, black woman. And they--that's what they were looking for, for her.
Speaker 1: And you figured put some--
Speaker 2: She--
Speaker 1: --clothes on for--no problem.
Speaker 2: Right. She had already fired four people. I don't know. And I, I knew what to do. I knew how to--from being with my sister [Brenda Free-Man] playing girl. So I knew how to dress. I knew what to do. I know how to service a person and dress them, you know, 'cause it is--it's something you do quietly, you know. It's not about you; it's about them. And they getting ready to go on--how to talk, leave them alone, and make them feel good.
Speaker 1: So you did it before Stephanie Mills and then--so now--
Speaker 2: I did it for her. She fired me.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Just like she fired them--'cause I wouldn't do certain things, I just wouldn't. And they wouldn't either. She was a spoiled brat then. She's not now. She's a beautiful woman now. But she was something then. But, but a voice like that--
Speaker 1: She was a star at that point.
Speaker 2: She didn't even know it. Oh, brilliant voice but bad attitude. I forg- oh, please, you know, I'm about the same age. I was like--please, you ain't g- . But they fired me. Guess what happened, though. They said, oh, no. She fired me. They said, oh, no, we like her. They moved me upstairs. 'Cause she was the star, she was down on first. They moved me upstairs to second with the br- and up there was the great [HistoryMaker] Andre De Shields who gave me my name, Jackee [HistoryMaker Jackee Harry].
Speaker 1: Now how did that come about?
Speaker 2: I went up and dressed him. They, they fi- she fired me but they liked me--everybody. They said move her upstairs. So I, I, I became his dresser--he and Mabel King, the late great Mabel King, Clarice Taylor, and Tiger Haynes--for the four of them. Let me tell you--that's the best acting lesson I got, 'cause I was still acting. They didn't know it, and I didn't say anything 'cause I was dressing.
Speaker 1: Andre De Shields--
Speaker 2: But they liked me, you know, and I liked them.
Speaker 1: Andre De Shields--
Speaker 2: He gave me my name.
Speaker 1: Also, also Mabel King you just said.
Speaker 2: The first naked man I saw in the theater, too, Andre De Shields. He was an exhibitionist. He walked around completely nude.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: It shocked the heck out of me.
Speaker 1: So now your name, your name. How did he give you your name?
Speaker 2: Calling me down the hall. This is Jackie. "Jackie, Jackie, Jack--Jackee!" From now on he, he said, "I'm Andre, you're Jackee." There was a guy named Ron [ph.], "You're Ronee."  You would have been Jacquee. You know, everybody was an a. But mine sounded good. And everybody start calling me Jackee. I mean, it's like one day--it was amazing.
Speaker 1: Now isn't, isn't Mabel King--wasn't she from the show--
Speaker 2: 'What's Happening!!'
Speaker 1: Yeah, 'What's Happening!!'
Speaker 2: She passed, you know.
Speaker 1: She played the mother.
Speaker 2: And she was the Evillene [Wicked Witch of the West]--brilliant. She did it in the movie ['The Wiz'], too, I believe, yeah--brilliant, brilliant, wonderful woman. Tiger Haynes, he's the late great Tiger Haynes. He was from vaudeville and--
Speaker 1: Now once again, you're--this is, this is 'The Wiz.'
Speaker 2: Yeah, but I, I didn't know. You know what I mean? I didn't know it was history--'cause they got terrible reviews. When I got there, they were all--'cause they'd been to Detroit [Michigan] and--they'd been doing this for a long time. But [HistoryMaker] Geoffrey Holder, George Faison [HistoryMaker George W. Faison], who played a huge part in my life, Charl- the composer, Charlie [Charlie Smalls]--I can't think of it now--the composer who wrote, you know, all those beautiful songs. So it was a great--Ken Harper [Kenneth Harper], who produced--he was black. I mean, it was a major thing--but I didn't know that.
Speaker 1: But now how did you feel, though. You're saying that all these black folks producing--
Speaker 2: I didn't feel anything. Who knew? You know (background noise), when you're, when you're in something you're not looking at it. Like I'm talking to you with you now; I'm not looking--my eyes not out there looking at us.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: When you're in it, who knew that it would be all that it turned out to be?
Story_ID: 473800
Speaker 1: So you're upstairs, upstairs--
Speaker 2: Doing my thing.
Speaker 1: Doing your thing, dressing and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Running around.
Speaker 1: See a lot of animation--
Speaker 2: Slightly overweight--now, this is important--remember, slightly overweight. That's why I didn't really, you know. And you know sister--my (gesture), you know, a whole, a whole down profile thing--not what you see today at all.
Speaker 1: And still, still acting.
Speaker 2: Still.
Speaker 1: But now you're upstairs with some, with some--we'll call it high animation with--these actors are animated--
Speaker 2: Intense.
Speaker 1: --onstage and offstage.
Speaker 2: Intense and professional, highly professional, but--and I also for a moment dressed the boys in the chorus downstairs. That--they wouldn't put me with the women. They put me with the men.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: I mean I got some tough l- really less- extreme lessons in a short amount of time.
Speaker 1: Can you share a few of these lessons with us?
Speaker 2: I don't think so on camera (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: It was all-black and all wild and just--but I mean the men were gay, the women were, were fabulous. It was--
Speaker 1: It was just a lot--
Speaker 2: Scandalous.
Speaker 1: It was a lot going on.
Speaker 2: I mean, that, that was--the--oh, Ted Ross, I forgot about him. But he had his own dresser. He didn't share. He had his own. But I did a couple of things for him. But boy I got lessons quick.
Speaker 1: So now on the acting side, though, you have a chance to watch all this great acting.
Speaker 2: Every day. I sucked it up. You, you know that. I was in the wings. And during this time--my dressing period--I did 'The Wiz,' my first one. I did 'Pippin' [Roger O. Hirson] with Ben Vereen. I dressed the great Mikhail Baryshnikov. I mean this is a short period of times. I'm not talking about--
Speaker 1: All of a sudden you, you--
Speaker 2: --a long--
Speaker 1: All of a sudden now you're known as a--
Speaker 2: I was a star dresser.
Speaker 1: You're a dress star (laughter)?
Speaker 2: But I knew how to do it and be, be fun at the same time, you know, and energetic, young, which they didn't have a lot of young people back then. They had hardly any black people in the union, the dressers' union [Theatrical Wardrobe Attendants Union, Local 764; Theatrical Wardrobe Union, Local 764 of the IATSE]. I got into the union, which was a big thing. And this black woman who was working at 'Pippin' got me into the union. And it took some doing 'cause there wasn't many of us at all. But I showed up and did my work, and she said that's very rare, you know.
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: So, all of this helped me.
Speaker 1: So now, so now you're a dresser, a star dresser. How about your own acting career? Is it time for that now?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: 'Cause there's no time now.
Speaker 2: But I'm still taking lessons in the daytime 'cause you dressed at night. But this is very short period of time. So I stayed there--I wasn't there maybe three months. They got a road company of 'The Wiz' together and they were going to Los Angeles [California]. And they wanted to take me.
Story_ID: 473801
Speaker 1: You've been in from Barnwell [South Carolina] to New York [New York]. Now's your chance to go to L.A. [Los Angeles, California]. Do you jump at it or do you hesitate?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I jump at it--you kidding? It was great. It was perfect.
Speaker 1: So now you're on the road.
Speaker 2: And a whole new group of people out in L.A.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Fabulous.
Speaker 1: So about '76 [1976], somewhere around '75 [1975]?
Speaker 2: Whenever, yeah, when Cheryl Lynn won 'The Gong Show.' You know who Cheryl Lynn is?
Speaker 1: In about--yeah, right, right. It's about seventy--
Speaker 2: We'll never forget it 'cause she--whatever that show was--I'm not so sure it was 'The Gong Show'--when you went on, you sang, and she won.
Speaker 1: It, it may have been 'The Gong Show.'
Speaker 2: We didn't even know she was gonna win. We scr- she sang 'You Are So Beautiful.' We screamed. She did the show two days, two performances, and was gone--became a star overnight.
Speaker 1: Overnight success.
Speaker 2: It was a brilliant time. It was sh- brief, though. Like I said, all this happened, god--I'm trying to get around to what happened, how I got back to acting. That's where we're going, right?
Speaker 1: Right. We're gonna go that direction. But now you're going to L.A. So you tell everybody in New York adios because you're on the way--how about--it was quick, too, right? You--
Speaker 2: Quick.
Speaker 1: --you had to go quickly. So you had this--your, your family, your mother [Flossie Harry], you had to tell everybody.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, my sister [Brenda Free-Man] went with--I got her a job 'cause I was like I don't want to be alone. I got her a job and we went--had a great time.
Speaker 1: So now, now talk about that. This--was this your first time to Los Angeles?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I left out something. You see, you're asking me about my life--I see that's why it takes so long 'cause people forget.
Speaker 1: Okay, go on back and show us how--
Speaker 2: I had been--the jobs--at the same time I got a teaching degree I was working on a social work degree. The part-time job I had was with the American black social workers' union. And I was working with them part-time. I was a busy girl. And they got me a scholarship to get a cer- a social worker's license. And that's what--that was my, that was my, that was my fallback plan. I was gonna be a social worker and teacher.
Speaker 1: So you had two licenses, okay.
Speaker 2: I never finished the so--I had nine credits to go--never finished 'cause I got (gesture). So I had been to California with them at their convention for about five days--me and my sister, we drove. What a time.
Speaker 1: Drove from New York?
Speaker 2: To L.A. for this convention, and then we drove back in my car. So that wasn't my first time. But this was my first time in show, in show business.
Speaker 1: Right, because it's very different coming in for a, for a convention in social work and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, but, but back then when I came for social workers, my girlfriend was going with a writer on 'Sanford and Son.' We stayed with them.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: So, no, it was, it was wild.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) So--
Speaker 2: Some revelations.
Speaker 1: --so you had had a taste of the L.A. thing.
Speaker 2: It's my first time seeing gay people in L.A. versus New York. New York they seemed so cool. Out here they were like, yeah, we gay, and, yeah, and who are you, you know.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) So now you're on your way back to experience some more L.A.
Speaker 2: In a different--yeah.
Speaker 1: This time you're, you're in show business.
Speaker 2: And I'm more confident, yeah. But I'm still doing the wardrobe thing.
Speaker 1: So you come out--
Speaker 2: But I've been promoted. I'm no longer a dresser. I'm the supervisor; I'm in charge and--
Speaker 1: You're in charge of all the other dressers.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, I'm all that.
Speaker 1: So now where was the play held?
Speaker 2: The Ahmanson Theater [Los Angeles, California]--big, bit ti- I'm talking about major. And everybody was here. We all loved each other. We had a blast.
Speaker 1: Did, did you--at this time were you and Stephanie [Stephanie Mills] on, on better terms?
Speaker 2: Unh-uh. I didn't see her, though. She, she stayed in New York. This was the L.A.--yeah, they got Renn Woods. They got a whole new company, except Andre [HistoryMaker Andre De Shields], he came and--
Speaker 1: Oh, they got a cast out here pretty much in Los Angeles.
Speaker 2: And one of the guys--I knew him, Ben Harney. He'd gone to Music and Art [High School of Music and Art; Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music and Art and Performing Arts, New York, New York], I knew him. I knew everybody, actually. I, I knew everybody in this business by that time. But what happened was I auditioned for a part in the play. I wanted to be a understudy. I wanted to be Glinda's understudy 'cause I could sing (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) The Good Witch.
Speaker 2: Do you know they wouldn't give me the part? And you know what she told me, the stage manager?
Speaker 1: What did she say?
Speaker 2: She said, "You're a dresser, and that's what you do. You will never be in this. You'll never sing 'cause you can't."
Speaker 1: Now who was this person? Do you recall--
Speaker 2: Annie, Ann [ph.]. I don't remember her, I don't remember her last name--thank you. I don't remember her last name. Her first name was Ann. She was older. I will never--she hurt me to the bone. I cried. I was so hurt. [HistoryMaker] Phylicia Rashad got it--well, she was Phylicia Ayers-Allen then. I was so upset. I quit--'cause I said she's right. You either do one thing or the other. You can't do both 'cause they'll never see you. So you have to get away from it. And that's just what I did.
Speaker 1: Outside of, outside of her saying that, did you have that conversation with anybody else about what she said--any--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --any of the actors?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And what did they tell you?
Speaker 2: They agreed. You have to disconnect yourself to be seen in another light. But she was full of crap--'cause they came back later and offered it to me later, much later. But at that point I decided I wanted to be a serious, dramatic actress (laughter).
Speaker 1: You been thinking sometimes--
Speaker 2: Excuse me.
Speaker 1: --as we say nowadays a multi-tasker, sometimes what you're multi-tasking can have an effect on how people view you and their opinion of you?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Go ahead and get some water. It's okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, multi-tasking can--no, I don't think so. I think it was the, the derogatory notion that a dresser is a servant or a maid or she couldn't get her--'cause she was the stage manager, you know, eggs and the--crabs in the barrel.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I got you.
Speaker 2: I saw her years later and she said, "I was wrong, huh?" I said, "Yeah."
Speaker 1: (Laughter) So, so you decide--
Speaker 2: Bitch (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Your will said okay, I'm quitting. So you're gonna quit being a dresser, but now you're out here in California, L.A.
Speaker 2: No, I went back to New York.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you went back to New York.
Speaker 2: I became very clear.
Speaker 1: Okay, and you said, okay, you--I'm gonna go. So you quit being a dresser (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) 'Cause I made a lot of money doing that.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Oh, I was making a ton. That was good job.
Speaker 1: Behind the scenes. But, but, but now--so--
Speaker 2: But everybody urged me to--Andre, everybody. They knew I was talented.
Story_ID: 473802
Speaker 1: So you come back to New York [New York]. This is '77 [1977], seven- somewhere around there.
Speaker 2: No, '78 [1978].
Speaker 1: Seventy-eight [1978], okay.
Speaker 2: And I came back and auditioned for a couple of shows. And I auditioned for George Faison [HistoryMaker George W. Faison] who was the choreographer and won the Tony [Antoinette Perry Award for Excellence in Theatre] for 'The Wiz.' And we became great friends, you know, when I--and I auditioned for him--me and Loretta Devine. We were on the corner coming from another audition--oh, I was coming from 'Ain't Misbehavin'' [Murray Horwitz and Richard Maltby, Jr.] which I thought I had and I did until he told me--he said, "What happened? You lost weight." And I was losing weight 'cause I thought that I could look better for certain parts. If I had kept the weight on, I'd have been in 'Ain't Misbehavin'.' Who knows what happened? You know, replacing [HistoryMaker] Armelia McQueen, who's in 'Damn Yankees.'
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And we're standing on the corner. We're like--what they want us to do 'cause we had been back ten times for 'Ain't Misbehavin'' so I was still up for it. We're standing on the corner of 48th Street and Broadway. Here comes George--
Speaker 1: You and Loretta Devine.
Speaker 2: Loretta, the Loretta Devine. We're standing there talking--who comes up? George Faison--he comes down, he's smoking a cigarette 'cause he's upstairs rehearsing something. He said, "What y'all doing?" Just like that. Said, "Uh, we're just waiting. We just came from a audition--'Ain't Misbehavin'.'" He said, "So come upstairs and audition for me. Come on." We walked upstairs with him. We auditioned, sang our song. And he did like this. He said, he said, "I don't have two parts." He said, "But you know what? I'll take one part and split it and you all can have it." And that's when I got my Equity card [Actors' Equity Association]--me and Loretta because of George Faison. He split the part--she got one--and we both joined Equity and got in his play--'A Broadway Musical' [William F. Brown]. And--
Speaker 1: Do you think that that was just pure love on his part?
Speaker 2: Pure. But he's done like that--lots of people. But timing, luck, being in the right place at the right time. I didn't even know about the audition. He just let us come upstairs 'cause he knew us, you know.
Speaker 1: Do you and Ms. Devine still talk about that to this day?
Speaker 2: To this day. But we began--you know, I love her--she's great. We began to go for a lot of parts and be in a lot of stuff together. And we'd go up for the same parts and be cast. If she didn't get it, I got it. I mean it was just like clockwork. It was great.
Speaker 1: So now you and her are cast in this, in this big play with the great George Faison.
Speaker 2: And three months we rehearsed with him to do the--because we're going to Broadway. And it was grueling. We were fat. He made us lose weight. It was terrible. We cried every day for three months. And we were up at the church at the Riverside [Riverside Church] in New York on 122nd [Street] near Riverside [Drive] rehearsing and performing and--a lot of peo- it was grueling. It was painful. He was a taskmaster.
Speaker 1: Let's talk about that for a moment, especially acting at that point--it seems that, you know, especially for African American women and because of natural size, just the, and just the naturalness of things and how we live our lives a lot of times. Was there a problem because of size and always having to lose weight and try to fit a certain image? 'Cause we know we hear about it today, but was it still a problem back then?
Speaker 2: No, it was a problem as it is now for me--gaining weight because you get a lot of jobs being heavier. And no disrespect to Loretta, but I don't get, I don- they don't even call me for those roles now. And I'm not saying it's 'cause--'cause she's brilliant, now, she's a good actress. But they don't see me as this mother yet. I will be in a minute (laughter)--what time is it?
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: But, you know, you become typecast.
Speaker 1: And, and back then, back then you got the--
Speaker 2: Heavier is better as it is now to work, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay, so how long, so, so how long did you stay in that production, you and Loretta? How long?
Speaker 2: Three months.
Speaker 1: Three months.
Speaker 2: And then to Broadway. And George Faison was replaced the very first day of rehearsal on Broadway. He had a falling out with the producer. And they replaced him with Gower Champion, the great Gower Champion.
Speaker 1: So this seems to be very serendipitous for you. Your life is--there's some strange things going on now. You get to Broadway with the play. And the person that gave you the part, you and Loretta--
Speaker 2: Is replaced.
Speaker 1: --when, when there was no two parts anyway.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: He create- created the part.
Speaker 2: He's gone.
Speaker 1: He's gone. So now you're--it's a--is it your safety net is now removed?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: It's not going yet, okay. Explain.
Speaker 2: Excuse me. I got something caught in my throat. No, he's replaced, basically fired (laughter) for whatever reason. And Gower Champion comes in on a Thursday. I'm telling you on Friday he took me out of the chorus--'cause she and I were in the chorus. He took me out of the chorus and gave me a part.
Speaker 1: He comes in on Thursday. He--
Speaker 2: Wednesday, Friday I had a part.
Speaker 1: He sees what's going on. He looks at--
Speaker 2: I became a principal and got a raise--everything.
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: Overnight. I mean it was immediate. He said, "Who's that back there. Who--you?" He said, "Come here. Sing the solo." So I given the part of Melinda [Melinda Bernard]--so just like that.
Speaker 1: That quick. What did Loretta say at that point 'cause she was--
Speaker 2: Nothing, no.
Speaker 1: It was all--
Speaker 2: I don't--no, 'cause she had a solo she sang.
Speaker 1: She's a very good singer, by the way.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, and a just--she sang these--she had a few--she, she had, she had her part. She didn't--you know, we didn't covet back then, you know. It wasn't a big part, but it was just the way it was.
Speaker 1: And it, and it was help each other and give support (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah. We're all in the play.
Story_ID: 473803
Speaker 1: Now all of a sudden you're snatched out of the chorus [of 'A Broadway Musical,' William F. Brown] and you're down here with this part [Melinda Bernard] all of a sudden. Of course, for Jackee [HistoryMaker Jackee Harry] that's no problem to learn the lines, huh?
Speaker 2: No (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) To learn the song.
Speaker 2: None.
Speaker 1: You're ready for it.
Speaker 2: Ready.
Speaker 1: Okay, so what happens then?
Speaker 2: It opened and closed in one night (laughter). But I got a call at three o'clock in the morning to do a show called 'Eubie!'
Speaker 1: So the play--
Speaker 2: They saw me in the play and they said we want you to do--to go on the road.
Speaker 1: So, so what happened to the play? It opened quickly and then--
Speaker 2: And closed that night. The producer killed his, his wife [Gwyda DonHowe] and himself the next morning--I kid you not.
Speaker 1: The producer killed himself and the--
Speaker 2: The producer who produced 'Oh! Calcutta!,' Norman [Norman Kean]--oh, I can't think his last name right now, but you can look--Norman killed himself. And 'Oh! Calcutta!' the new play, which ran for a thousand years--he killed his wife who--she was in the play.
Speaker 1: Killed her and himself.
Speaker 2: Shot her and he killed himself.
Speaker 1: Okay, let's back up for a moment. Now all of a sudden this strange occurrences are happening. George Faison [HistoryMaker George W. Faison] creates a part for you and Loretta [Loretta Devine]. You're in the chorus. George Faison gets fired.
Speaker 2: Gower Champion comes in.
Speaker 1: Gower Champion comes in, puts you into, into a main part, principal. The play opens and closes over--
Speaker 2: One day and night.
Speaker 1: And the producer kills--
Speaker 2: Terrible review--
Speaker 1: --himself and his wife.
Speaker 2: There you go.
Speaker 1: And then the next morning after all this is going on, three o'clock in the morning you get a phone call--from who, now, Jackee?
Speaker 2: Barry Moss and Julie Hughes. They were cast directors and they needed somebody to do 'Eubie!'
Speaker 1: They were there that night of the bad reviews.
Speaker 2: They were there at previews. So they watched me. They came couple a couple of times.
Speaker 1: And 'Eubie!' being, being the play based upon--
Speaker 2: Eubie Blake.
Speaker 1: Eubie Blake, the great piano player.
Speaker 2: Which it was already on Broadway with Gregory Hines and some other people. Gregory Hines was discovered in that show--I mean his vocal talent, not his tap dance.
Speaker 1: So at three o'clock in the morning, what do, what do you say to them?
Speaker 2: Hell, yes. I was in my little one bedroom. And I just remem- but, you know, by then I was used to show biz being a funny creature. You just never know when you're being seen or when you're gonna get a job. And I'll say yeah. And it was a long--eight-month tour, and I took it.
Story_ID: 473804
Speaker 1: So you're getting 'Eubie!' (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) But I had gotten married, too.
Speaker 1: Okay, let's talk about that now 'cause we, we just--
Speaker 2: Must we?
Speaker 1: Well, yes, we must (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: Tell us about it--or how you met your husband at that time.
Speaker 2: (Pause) Boy got to back before 'Eubie!' I met him in between the time I did m- 'Broadway Musical' ['A Broadway Musical,' William F. Brown] with Loretta [Loretta Devine] and another play. I did a off-Broadway play with the--S. Epatha Merkerson. George Faison [HistoryMaker George W. Faison] was directing it again, doing the choreography and somebody else was doing the book. And I got in this play and I came in and my husband was in the orchestra, Jerry Jemmott, and--
Speaker 1: Great bass player.
Speaker 2: Love--yeah, a great bass player. Love at first sight--instant. And I was cute and perky and round (laughter). But, you know, we all were. I was--I, I pursued him immediately, and he responded. And he, he was old--he's like nine years older. I was like, (makes noise) and got married--whirlwind.
Speaker 1: Whirlwind relationship.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: So you got married so--
Speaker 2: And so I had that--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --experience. And he, he was successful. And we loved all of that stuff.
Speaker 1: So you all were married and so now you're in 'Eubie!' and, and--
Speaker 2: Which goes on tour, which to me is threatening to my, my upcoming marriage, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But he was cool.
Speaker 1: So, so, oh, you're not married yet.
Speaker 2: No, I'm not. I'm engaged.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But, I mean, right there. I mean, we're right in the middle of it. No, we are married. I'm sorry, we are.
Speaker 1: Okay, so now you're, so now, now you have a husband and it's time to go on tour with the play.
Speaker 2: And I'm going on the road.
Speaker 1: And he's a musician, so he's aware of--
Speaker 2: What the separation--and he's cool about it. I'm not. I'm nervous. I'm like I can't go away. You got a marriage. What are you doing? And he said, "No, go, do it. Go, do it. It's good for your career." And I went, did--me and Chris Calloway, the daughter of the late Cab Calloway. And a few other people, I don't know if you had known but--we ran that tour (laughter). We were the it girls. Eight months--it was a cast tour--whew! But I was fabulous, and he came out to see me often. But it was grueling. But it, it, it made me know what I had to do, you know.
Speaker 1: Was it a strain on your marriage?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But it lasted. He waited. He, he was cool. I wasn't. But he came to see me often. And I, eventually when I quit, I went away with him on a job he got and went around the world twice with him, which was great.
Speaker 1: This was like what year?
Speaker 2: But my marriage broke up.
Speaker 1: This is what--what, what year was this? About '79 [1979]?
Speaker 2: From 1978 on. I got married '81 [1981], about then. And I got another break.
Speaker 1: Tell us about this. So now you--'cause--so now you--
Speaker 2: 'Cause I'm working, working, working--then I stop and go with him on his--
Speaker 1: For how long?
Speaker 2: I was with him six months. Then I got a gig and I flew back for it, which was a play that Toni Morrison had got together. I did that at the workshop. Got back, went back with him. I was back maybe a month and they called me--told me I--that they wanted me to do this play--that I had done the little bit and they were gonna do it. I went back. It's called New Orleans Stor- 'Storyville' [sic. 'New Orleans'] about the, you know, the red light district in a musical. [HistoryMaker] Geoffrey Holder was directing, [HistoryMaker] Carmen De Lavallade was doing something, and Toni Morrison wrote the book. And it was directed by [HistoryMaker] Donald McKayle, the great Donald McKayle. And we were going on and on and on. And I had a part--I was playing a prostitute, a lady of the night--seven of us--great ladies, all working now, every one of them.
Story_ID: 473805
Speaker 1: So you're working, you're traveling with your husband [Jerry Jemmott] and you get a play, in this play. The play is 'Storyville' [sic. 'New Orleans,' Toni Morrison]. And you play a lady of the evening.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: You and seven, with seven young ladies. Any of note?
Speaker 2: Well, I'll tell you their name--now Charlayne Woodard, she's done quite a few things. She was in 'Unbreakable' with Bruce Willis playing Samuel L. Jackson's mother. You know her from that and she does, writes all her own stuff, her own plays. She's on 'Law and Order' ['Law and Order: Special Victims Unit']. Ann Duquesnay who was just in the one ['Bring in 'da Noise, Bring in 'da Funk,' Reg E. Gaines] with [HistoryMaker] Savion Glover on Broadway and she was also in Hot, 'Hot Feet' [Heru Ptah]. She's a working Broadway actress, wonderful singer. Some of the other ones, they're gorgeous. You don't see them anymore. One passed--two of them passed. One went to Europe. They're still working, you know, but, but, but like I said the stars of that were [HistoryMaker] Geoffrey Holder, George--they were the stars.
Speaker 1: So now this play is touring, this play?
Speaker 2: No, it's a workshop in New York [New York].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Down in the very studio that 'Dreamgirls' got started later, of which I was a part of for a short, short time. I'll tell you about that. It was at 890 studio [ABT 890 Broadway Studios, New York, New York]--excuse me, it was a workshop, meaning we work it up and get it ready to get sampled to go to Broadway possibly, you know.
Speaker 1: Now, are, are, are people paid during this procedure?
Speaker 2: No, they invite producers and prospective producers and people who are interested maybe in, in getting it started. They--
Speaker 1: So, so you have to have a real commitment in order to go--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --to the rehearsals and do the reading and you have to be committed--
Speaker 2: Yes, you have to believe in the project. And, I mean, Toni Morrison, I was like yeah--Geoffrey Holder, George Faison [HistoryMaker George W. Faison], I mean, come on, yeah. And it was in a place, a studio no bigger than this. You, you, you rehearsed and then you performed it. And they had folded chairs. So it was like in a working dance studio space.
Speaker 1: That's interesting 'cause in today's day and age people really expect to be paid immediately for everything. And there's no--and that, and that creative part of things--a lot of times people wait--you hear them, "How much is it paying?" Like, "Is it a paid audition?"
Speaker 2: Well if you have a certain level, you know, they paid you. Don't get me wrong--they paid us.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: But, you know, not, not any big time salaries.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, you know, very (laughter)--but the, the timeframe is there. They'll tell you six weeks rehearsal and then get it ready for this many performances. And you will be seen by the top-notch people. It's worth it.
Speaker 1: And, and in the meantime they're looking for places to put it on and do all and all those invest--
Speaker 2: And people to promote--and they had an investor.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But then when we, we did it, it, it wasn't quite what they wanted. But we did the workshop. We performed. From that workshop--and my husband's on the road back in, he's in Africa. I'm supposed to go join him.
Speaker 1: Who is he playing with? Do you know he, probably who he was playing with?
Speaker 2: I'm trying to think. It was for a festival that traveled. We went to--and you probably know it--it was the jazz festival and it would--toured. But he was up in West Afri- Senegal, Nigeria--we went all of those and then we went to the Goree [Goree Island, Dakar, Senegal] and then we went--swung around to Paris [France] and--it's, it's, it's a festival that goes on every year and you go with your band for the duration.
Speaker 1: Just for a brief moment talk about being married to a creator because he was, he's been known as a very good bass player. Was it--
Speaker 2: He, and he (laughter), for me he, he had dreadlocks, which was unheard of back then. I used to walk down the street like this. I couldn't stand people staring at us, but I was attracted to it immediately.
Speaker 1: Yeah, he had dreads, but you're right--
Speaker 2: One of the first.
Speaker 1: Early.
Speaker 2: I was--oh god, I could not believe it. But soon as I saw him it was instant.
Speaker 1: Was there ever any conflict because of music? You know, you're an actress and a music, a musician and he's a musician. Was it a better marriage you think?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And was that aspect because--
Speaker 2: It was good. He knew, he knew more than me. I was quite immature. I'm mean, this is in retrospect. But he knew, he, he knew I was a talent. He said you're gonna be famous. And he got a act together, I mean, did the music, we did it at a club. He pushed me because he said you're gonna be good. I mean, he was really supportive. I just didn't have the foresight or whatever--
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: --to know. I was just in love, you know.
Story_ID: 473806
Speaker 1: So he's [Harry's ex-husband, Jerry Jemmott] in Africa and you're in this play ['New Orleans,' Toni Morrison] in this workshop.
Speaker 2: For this short amount of time. And I'm doing it. And we perform it. And I'm do it and then I'm gonna get on a plane and go back and meet him. I get a call the next morning from the casting lady--her first name was Elizabeth [ph.]--are casting at a soap opera. And she calls my then agent, Richard Astor, my very first agent in New York [New York] and said--who is also Mel Carter's agent--was first.
Speaker 1: So now you had an agent at this point, okay.
Speaker 2: I got him from when I did 'A Broadway Musical' [William F. Brown]. He came up and gave me his card--left that out.
Speaker 1: Now I, I want to bring that up real quick. So once that occurs, for those that di- don't understand acting, once an agent of his--
Speaker 2: Stature.
Speaker 1: --prestige, with the stature comes up to you and gives you a card, it's a, it's, it's an invitation--
Speaker 2: To come join the agency--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --absolutely. They don't give you their card otherwise. This or they'll send somebody say come and have a meeting. He said here's my card when you need.  And I went, called him, and boom (snaps fingers). And--but, but I got it and, and think she called and she said, "I have a part, a day player," which is, you know, five lines or less. "Can she come do it?" And I was supposed to fly back. I said, okay, one day. I went on Tuesday. I had two lines, "Who is it? Oh, it's you (laughter)." My name was Lilly Mason, a prostitute. That's why she saw me in the play. I did those two lines. They called me that night and said they were gonna give me four more the next day. So I had to stay an extra day, Wednesday. I went in--I had six lines.
Speaker 1: Now you're supposed to be going back to Africa with your husband?
Speaker 2: I'm supposed to be going back to Africa--rejoin him. I don't know if he's in Africa or Paris [France]--it's one of those. But I--it was a plane ride. And I was upset--torn. I said, oh well, more money. I need the money. It was $450 for a day player. I said okay. Did the six lines. That night they told me we're gonna need you next week for three days. I was--ooh. So I called and told him. He said, well, stay, and then I did it. I got there on Monday. I did those twelve lines. At the end of the week they said we want you to be a contract player. I swear to you it happened just that quick.
Speaker 1: So now you have to stay.
Speaker 2: And I'm separated from my husband and that was the beginning. And I started making a lot, lot of money overnight.
Speaker 1: Now what was this day player as you say? What was this particular show?
Speaker 2: 'Another World,' it's no longer on. I was Lilly Mason. I had short hair. I was sassy--
Speaker 1: So, so--
Speaker 2: --very raw.
Speaker 1: So as we say in the African American community, you're now on the stories.
Speaker 2: Yes (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: A successful one at that time, too.
Speaker 1: Right, you're on this story.
Speaker 2: With some powerful people. I joined the cast.
Speaker 1: Who were some of the actors?
Speaker 2: Morgan Freeman, who a lot of people don't realize could not get a job to save his life for years. He was on the 'Electric Circus' [sic. 'The Electric Company'] a man of that stature. He didn't really get famous 'til he turned almost fifty, if you think about it. But, god, we knew he, who he was. Morgan Freeman, Joe Morton --I don't know if you know Joe Morton--'Brother from Another Planet' ['The Brother from Another Planet']. But he does a lot of things. Petronia Paley, she's still a working actress. Michele Shay, she's still a working actress. And I'm leave--they had a huge--Robin Christopher, he [sic. she], he passed away early--sad, I loved him dearly. But they had a huge black cast. And for them to add me, it took courage 'cause what did they need me for.
Speaker 1: Now wasn't 'Another World' considered to be one of the first--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --African American soap operas?
Speaker 2: That's right. They had a huge--it wasn't about a huge storyline.
Speaker 1: Right, the whole, the whole thing wasn't about that, but it was--
Speaker 2: It was huge, it's major.
Speaker 1: --the first time that, that they--
Speaker 2: And they integrated it well, you know. It was really well done. And, of course, you know, they have it now but--. And it was a young girl on there. I was playing her aunt. Her mother had abandoned her and left her with me. And I was no good. I ain't care nothing about her.
Speaker 1: And you're Lilly Mason.
Speaker 2: Child, I was a whore on Tuesday. The following two weeks they cleaned me up. I became the owner of a club.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: 'Cause when they like you--and that's when I knew I was in. And they gave me a three-year contract. And you know what happened after that.
Story_ID: 473807
Speaker 1: So you and Brother Jemmott [Jerry Jemmott] now at this point part the ways after--
Speaker 2: Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) after a while.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: What did, what--was it amicable, was it--
Speaker 2: Hell, no (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: Oh, you can't say that in the archives.
Speaker 1: Sure you can.
Speaker 2: (Sighs) No, wasn't amicable. It was terrible, awful. I was hurt deeply and disappointed.
Speaker 1: Who divorced who, if you don't mind me asking?
Speaker 2: Oh, who got the divorce? He got the divorce. He got the divorce. I, I really--
Speaker 1: He's back now from--
Speaker 2: I did not want a divorce. Huh?
Speaker 1: He's back now from--he, he was back from his tour, right? So means he in the city [New York, New York] with you?
Speaker 2: And this time in between, you know, everything's not rosy the way I'm, we're talking now. You know, life stills carries on.
Speaker 1: Life is life.
Speaker 2: And he was a Buddhist. And I have things going on, you know, but it changed. We grew apart, too. It wasn't just--I'm looking at in retrospect like I say I was too young. I was very immature, and he told me that 'cause he was nine years older. And now that I'm older I know just what he's saying. And when I go out with young men I go, oh gosh--you know, you just don't know. And nobody can tell you anything when you're young. You know, when you're young you make your own decisions and suffer the con- nobody can tell you. But it hurt me very deep. I was very hurt and--but, at the same time I was very successful.
Speaker 1: Your career is blossoming.
Speaker 2: So I never could feel it 'cause I didn't have time to sit back and feel it. But I was very hurt. I didn't tell too many people. I told them and it--and they looked at me and they kept saying, well, you look great. But I was, I was in pain, man. I mean, I see people now and they get a divorce and they look better, but--and what I'm trying to say is who--no matter who asks for it, it's painful.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: It doesn't really matter 'cause it happened.
Speaker 1: And it didn't, and it didn't end as well as it should have. It didn't, it didn't end like it began.
Speaker 2: Right, oh god. And I was very upset. And he was with, got with somebody else, and that really upset me. But, as I'm speaking to you now I was working every day. And I was at the soap ['Another World'] maybe almost two years when I got the call to go to L.A. [Los Angeles, California] to audition for '227.'
Speaker 1: Okay, so you learned how to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So--
Speaker 1: So, so--
Speaker 2: --in the midst of all this personal tragedy, I'm still working. My luck is still holding.
Speaker 1: So Jackee [HistoryMaker Jackee Harry] had learned to compartmentalize very well. You have this pain going on with your, your personal life--
Speaker 2: I was upset, oh. I couldn't get over it.
Speaker 1: So, so do you think that--
Speaker 2: Very hurt.
Speaker 1: --that your act, acting was your cathartic re- your cathartic release for all the pain you might be feeling or, or was it just put to the side--
Speaker 2: Put--
Speaker 1: --and you did what you had to do?
Speaker 2: Denial, just total--'cause I couldn't use it. If I had been in a play where I could use it, I would have. But--
Speaker 1: Could not use it.
Speaker 2: I couldn't use it, I couldn't use it for--
Speaker 1: Because the role didn't call for it.
Speaker 2: And I was also doing a movie at the same time I was doing the soap--'Moscow on the Hudson' with Robin Williams.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: I had to leave that show to go do '227.' A lot of p- that movie--and I never completed all my scenes. That's why I'm not in it that much--yeah, it's like the very beginning. Aw, and I was gorgeous then. I had lost weight. I was--oh.
Story_ID: 473808
Speaker 1: So now you're on TV, the people are (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Totally unexpected.
Speaker 1: People are seeing it--now your family at this point--your mom [Flossie Harry] and everyone--what is--
Speaker 2: And my mother's very ill at this time.
Speaker 1: And your, and your sister [Brenda Free-Man]--
Speaker 2: And that's why my marriage [to Jerry Jemmott]--yeah, my mother died in '84 [1984]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --right as I got '227.' So she never got to see it.
Speaker 1: And your sister ever, and, and, and your sister's still around now and she's wa- watching you--
Speaker 2: My brothers.
Speaker 1: Your brothers. And people are starting to notice Lilly Mason now. And, and they want to see, see what she's doing tomorrow. So you're getting some household attention now. People around the country--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So now you're walking down the street and it's not the same thing going into the--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --grocery store. "Aren't you Lilly Mason?"
Speaker 2: And I was hanging out with Debbi Morgan, who was on 'All My Children.' She was big star--
Speaker 1: Everyone knew her.
Speaker 2: --people would ask her for her autograph.
Speaker 1: Everyone knew her.
Speaker 2: And one, one night we're at the restaurant. Somebody came over and I just automatically assumed they wanted her autograph and they said, "Oh no, we want Lilly Mason's autograph." And that's when I knew--I was like (gesture).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) So now you're on the show ['Another World'] and you, and, and at that time I think '84 [1984] Robin Williams was very hot. He, he was good--because he had done the 'Mork and Mindy,' he had done all that stuff. So he was known. So you're on this movie ['Moscow on the Hudson']. What happened--
Speaker 2: His breakthrough movie.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: That was his first successful movie. It was terrible--painful. I--you know, you have to make decisions. I didn't know then that I was gonna blow up.
Speaker 1: So, okay, '227'--
Speaker 2: I didn't want to go.
Speaker 1: You, you get a call from '227.'
Speaker 2: I didn't want to go. I wanted to be a serious actress 'cause I was--had a serious part. I had a good part. I would have been famous anyway. If I had stayed, I figured I would have been famous anyway. I know it. But, I was like--I read the script for '227.' I was like--it was so--I cannot tell you. I was like, oh, I can do this 'cause the money they were paying I was like, oh, I can use that. I mean, it was lots--just for one time. I was like, okay.
Speaker 1: And you're in California, you'd be in California.
Speaker 2: No, I didn't care about California. I'm--so the money. I was like--and I looked at it, I was like they ain't gonna do nothing with this. I was like--. So I got on the plane and I was by myself. I was like, ooh, I'm the only black woman they called out, me and a couple other people. I'm sitting there having a little wine--it was a night flight. Twenty minutes before takeoff thirty black women got on that plane (laughter). I was like--. And it was all of us. We had a ball. Got up there--it was three hundred black women 'cause it was three roles to audition for. We partied. We stayed at the Howard Johnson, the Beverly [Beverly Hills Hotel, Beverly Hills, California]--we had ball.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: I mean, open door. It was like a pajama party. It was so much fun. And we auditioned that day.
Speaker 1: Every--
Speaker 2: Ton.
Speaker 1: --everybody auditioned.
Speaker 2: I auditioned off--
Speaker 1: Who, who, who else was there? Who else was there that, that we might--
Speaker 2: Just a bunch of peo- I don't know if you even know them from--it's, it's too, too many to name. But Sheryl Lee Ralph was there. We were in the room.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: And I went in and everybody was looking at me when I went in. And I went in twice. I went in for Alaina Reed's [Alaina Reed Hall] part for Rose [Rose Lee Holloway]. And then they said could you go change and come back and do Sandra [Sandra Clark]. I said okay and I went and put on red dress with earrings and went back in. And the late great Brandon Tartikoff--he said give it to her (unclear) any more left. And Marla [HistoryMaker Marla Gibbs] didn't want to give it to me. She wanted to give it to the girl who was in the play 'cause it was--
Speaker 1: Out of three hundred people it's already been--you're always been deemed out--give it to that one. Have you, are you noticing that theme? People are just--that one--wow. So, so now, so, so Ms. Gibbs already had the part. She was--
Speaker 2: She was the star. It was her play. She had optioned the rights. And Norman Lear came and saw the play and said this could be a sitcom and turned it. His company then was Columbia Embassy [sic. Embassy Communications, Inc.], and he gave it to them to turn over into a series.
Speaker 1: So she wanted to give it to, to the girl--
Speaker 2: So Brandon Tartikoff, the head of the network, was auditioning. He was in the room actually. They don't do that anymore. He was actually in the room.
Speaker 1: That was ABC, right?
Speaker 2: NBC.
Speaker 1: NBC, the head of NBC was actually--
Speaker 2: The head.
Speaker 1: --in the room.
Speaker 2: In the room.
Speaker 1: So he was hands on with what--
Speaker 2: I had sent a tape to L.A. [Los Angeles, California] before I came, by the way. They didn't just send for me. I sent a tape and off the tape they said come out. That's how they got us all from New York [New York].
Speaker 1: Okay. So he was actually hands on with, with what was, what was going on with the network--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --not just up in the tower.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: He was down there.
Speaker 2: In that room at NBC over there where Jay Leno and them are when you go over there--Alameda [California]. It was divine.
Speaker 1: So Marla Gibbs, probably because of her allegiance to the girl--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --that was in the play--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --she wanted to give it to her.
Speaker 2: Rosie Lee Hooks, [HistoryMaker] Robert Hooks' then wife, yes. The part was only for seven episodes out of twenty-two. It wasn't a--my part that was gonna be on it, it was just gonna be a short while. So then that's what the contract read so--
Speaker 1: You said fine.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 473809
Speaker 1: So now developing this character. How did this get started for you to, to develop the character we all know and love?
Speaker 2: On the set [of '227'] on the stoop the very first scene when I come up it just--she said, "Sandra [Sandra Clark], how come you not a work?" I said, "I'm sick." The director came up. He said, "Why you doing that line like that?" He said, "Just do it normal." And, you know, we had done it in the f- "I men- I'm sick. I'm taking off." But, you know, he said, "Why you doing that?" And so I start to say, okay. She said, "Sandra, you going to work?" I said, "Oh, yeah, I'm sick, you know, I'm taking off" so-and-so. Brandon Tartikoff called down to the set, rings it, "What's going on down there? She was funny for the--what you all doing?" And he told the director. The director said, "Uh, go back to what you were doing." And--
Speaker 1: He's up in the booth listening and watching.
Speaker 2: He's on his monitor in his office. And they said--and he told me, the director, then, he said, "Jackee [HistoryMaker Jackee Harry], you can't upstage the star." And I didn't know that. I was just being funny like I always--. Had I known then what he's telling me, I would not have done--I'll tell you the truth 'cause I did not know that. I was just being funny. And she said, "No, more, more, more." And they kept going more, more, more. Well, honey, once they said that I just turned loose.
Speaker 1: The horse was out the barn at that point.
Speaker 2: And they came back that day and gave me a new contract for a regular on the show, so--
Speaker 1: So the writers got busy.
Speaker 2: Now, tell us about Ms. Gibbs and you and her, your association on the set with her, especially after you've done this now.
Speaker 1: We're, well, I'll just start by saying this, life can come full circle. And I, I tell this to everybody. Me and [HistoryMaker] Marla Gibbs and like this now (gesture). We weren't then. I adore her. She's good people. And she told me, she said people were just putting stuff in her ear and she was listening to it--that she's stealing the show. She's doing this, she's doing--I was being funny because that's way I naturally am even today. But, I hear what they're saying now. I was pushing that envelope and you don't do that. You know, I recognize it now. But, I had been other shows and I, I thought, well, if they're so funny why don't you spin 'em off. They're so funny, spin 'em off and have two. That's the way I thought, you know. And--but it was, it was stressful and a strain. It really was 'cause I had no idea. The day I got my Emmy [Emmy Award]--I won the Emmy. I came back to work. Nobody congratulated me--not a single soul. But it goes back to what my teacher told me, "We just knew you would." So--and it still happens to me today. I don't get, "Oh, that's great! I was so happy for you!" I always get, "Oh, we knew," you know.
Speaker 2: So, so things are kind of strained on the set--as, as we hear many shows are because what we see as an audience is not, you know--oh, and actually (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Absolutely.
Speaker 2: --any kind of--any kind of production of anything--
Speaker 1: Any kind.
Speaker 2: You never know from, from six o'clock news.
Speaker 1: You don't know who's gonna be the breakout.
Speaker 2: Right. So you stay there for--how long was '227'? How many years?
Speaker 1: Five years.
Speaker 2: Five years, a five-year run.
Speaker 1: And they tried to spin me off. It didn't make it for different reasons--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --which I know about, so--but it was very successful--
Speaker 2: What was the name of the spinoff show?
Speaker 1: 'Jackee.'
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's right.
Speaker 1: It didn't work. But I didn't have stuff in place. You gotta have your stuff in place to--you know, I didn't know that meant. What I know now, even if I knew it then, wouldn't have made any difference--TV, the politics.
Story_ID: 473810
Speaker 1: So you're there and you, you're trying different things. You, you've been successful. Everybody--and there are people now, little girls running around playing you now, imitating themselves and doing--and you created a, a little persona that people are latching on to. You, you can--and young ladies I, I can recall being out and, and they're acting like Jackee [HistoryMaker Jackee Harry] now. They're doing different things. So you, you're known. Now something happens to you, you get a chance to be in this movie. Or, or am I leaving out something? Is it too, is it--
Speaker 2: Movie, which movie (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oprah Winfrey, or the other TV show, the 'Brewster's Place' ['The Women of Brewster Place']. Tell us about how that came about or is there something before that that we have to discuss?
Speaker 2: I can't remember. '227'--I did so much. I cannot tell you. I became a starlight with that show and didn't even know it. You know, I wasn't even--I was just doing what you do when your career is hot. You, you just do it. You don't really, you know, you don't really think about it. So, I did a lot of things. But that was a big one. I didn't see it as a big one--I'll be honest with you. I, I had read the book and I loved it and--but I knew Oprah Winfrey. But you gotta remember she, who she is today is not even who she was then.
Speaker 1: Right, 'cause that was about 19--that was in the '80s [1980s], like eighty--
Speaker 2: But she hand-picked everybody. And she said get her 'cause she knew what she wanted even then. But--
Speaker 1: How was that because there was a lot of great actors in that, actresses in that?
Speaker 2: Major. Me, her, Robin Givens.
Speaker 1: Cicely Tyson.
Speaker 2: Cicely Tyson, Lynn Whitfield, Lonette McKee, Paula Kelly, major. Wonderful, wonderful people. Oh, no, it was no problem, no problem at all. It was really a great thing. And I, I'm saying when you're doing something you don't really think that way, you know. And I, I--people still don't believe that I can act--so (background noise) somebody think I'm just--
Speaker 1: (TAPE INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 2: So, you're a star at this point, really. You really are a star. And Oprah Winfrey decides, you know, her thing is taking off now with her own produc- she's a little past just a TV host and now she's starting to produce films and things--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --which--but when, when we you send the word produced, we, we mean creatively but it also means putting the cash behind it.
Speaker 1: Power.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Influence.
Speaker 2: So how, so how--this movie was about some strong-willed black women. So how did that, how did that resonate with you doing that role?
Speaker 1: Well, but it's just a job, to be honest. I mean, I can't tell you, I can't honestly sit here and tell that, oh, I'm--'cause I, I was kind of riding kind of high.
Speaker 2: Don't forget you used to be a activist. So, so I'm, I'm wondering did, did the activist part of you kick in and say, yeah, let's do a black women strong movie?
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: 'Cause I was a strong black woman. You know, you don't really--
Speaker 2: And a star at this point.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I was riding kind of high. It's--you know, water seeks its own levels like when you look at Oprah, people think she go--that she sit around and go I'm the great Oprah--no (laughter). You are who you are, you know.
Speaker 2: It's a recurring theme that we've heard 'cause we've interviewed several people and they've always said you're older, much older--what were you thinking back then? They said nothing--I was too busy.
Speaker 1: I don't know if that, yeah, maybe? I don't even know about being so much so--once you in it, you in it.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: That's why I always say water seeks--once you're on the thing, you're just there, you--and you look back--I don't know. It's sort of like you just keep, keep at it.
Speaker 2: So, the, there's a great, there's a great, a great situation for you. Now how long did that last? That was--
Speaker 1: We did awhile. But--it was a hot--I, I just can't--it was just--I can't, I can't explain it to you. Doing a movie, getting up that early every day and--it's sort of like a blur (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yeah, I understand.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and I was doing this, this show.
Speaker 2: You were still doing '227,' so it was a lot going on.
Speaker 1: And a lot of other things, a lot of other things--
Story_ID: 473811
Speaker 1: I mean (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Do you think that you've been managing things very well for years because of your early, early multi-tasking--it was easier for you than some people could be, some people?
Speaker 1: No, I just think it was luck and God. It--'cause I packed it in. And I didn't really enjoy it as much as I should have and could have. But I had a good time.
Speaker 2: I hear you.
Speaker 1: But I had a lot of personal demons going on. And that's why I said--but publicly, you know, I'm, and professionally, I was very successful. But personally I was very much a failure--'cause my marriage had dissolved in that--
Speaker 2: Right, and you were still--
Speaker 1: I wasn't dealing with it. Yeah, I just got out here and was Jackee [HistoryMaker Jackee Harry] on '227.' But I got out here and was on the show, and he [Harry's ex-husband, Jerry Jemmott] called me while I was in L.A. [Los Angeles, California] and I mean to borrow money. And I was going out with Blair Underwood (laughter), and I answered the phone and I could not believe it--that he's asking me to borrow money after what you did to me. But you know what I said to him? I said, "Oh, let me get back to you," and hung up the phone. And I realized then--that's when I knew I was a star 'cause I didn't deal with it. I kind of went--and pressed right on. Whereas before I'd been like, woo, he bet--you know, had no time to even deal with that. And I realized then, you know, that's life.
Speaker 2: So there's some healing at that point.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Did you send him the money? Did you send him the money?
Speaker 1: You know, I ain't send him no money.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: He got money from the divorce. Some--I'm trying to tell you. I had to pay him.
Speaker 2: I hear you.
Speaker 1: And he told me, "You can't--you ain't gonna be, you ain't gonna be able to afford this apartment." It's a beautiful apartment in New York [New York]--sold that. It was great. Bought it and sold it. And he told me you can't afford it. You know, life is, is deep.
Speaker 2: So at this point the immature one had grown up as you are--you, you had grown up now--
Speaker 1: Yeah, and he had, too. He--'cause he was a wise guy. I'm not gonna act like he was dog--he wasn't a--. He just was very, very way ahead of his time for me.

Speaker 1: So you're, you're out in California. You, you're, you're on the dating scene again now. You're starting to deal with the situation a little bit now. You're starting to get that, get that relief--
Speaker 2: And I'm looking fabulous.
Speaker 1: Yeah, but you're looking good. You're a star. So now the other TV show comes around for you. The 'Amen' show. Tell us about that.
Speaker 2: Well, I was just getting offers from everywhere. And Ed. Weinberger said come over here 'cause I would have been a, a regular on that. But by then I had gotten w- wise to the fact that you can't be too fabulous. You got to kind of pull it back. So I, I didn't push that 'cause I know I was making people uncomfortable, you know, I know. 'Cause they say, "Jackee [HistoryMaker Jackee Harry] say she gonna steal your job." That's the reputation. It was like, oh.
Speaker 1: So, how is L.A. [Los Angeles, California] at that point for you, I mean--
Speaker 2: Fabulous.
Speaker 1: --you're just having a great time just--
Speaker 2: Great time, great h- money, six--I don't know how many cars I had. I was in it. And I was saving money (laughter). You know, it just, it was a great time to be--the '80s [1980s] and the early '90s [1990s] was the best for, for everybody. I mean it was, it was just the highlight. And that's why I say Ronald Reagan [President Ronald Wilson Reagan] might be one of my favorite presidents (laughter).
Speaker 1: Everything was good during those times but--. Now you had several roles in all--we won't go into all you had--
Speaker 2: 'The Royal Family.'
Speaker 1: The--you know, 'The Royal Family'--let's talk about--that's very important to talk about that.
Speaker 2: With the great Della Reese [HistoryMaker Della Reese-Lett]. I didn't get along with her at first--same thing with Marla. But I got to know her and I adore her--full circle with her and [HistoryMaker] Marla Gibbs--full circle.
Speaker 1: And, and let's discuss those, those, that period for a moment because we've had a chance to interview [HistoryMaker] Prince Spencer who was Redd Foxx's manager at that time. And he talks about, talks about that day. Were you there that day when everything went down?
Speaker 2: (Nods head) It was scary, you know, totally unexpected. Turned gray, turned completely gray and nobody knew what was happening.
Speaker 1: Story is it was just a normal situation and, and--
Speaker 2: I mean, just like we're talking now--boom. And nobody knew what--nobody mouth-to-mouth. It happened so quick. And he turned instantly, you know (snaps fingers)--he died pretty, pretty quick.
Speaker 1: Now how, now how was that with--because now on that particular show, 'The Royal Family,' there was some straight up funny comedians on there, Reynaldo Rey.
Speaker 2: He had a lot of old, old-timers. I was like (makes noise).
Speaker 1: And, and--
Speaker 2: I mean.
Speaker 1: I think Slappy White--was he in too?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I mean, oh, you said old, (makes noise).
Speaker 1: And Redd.
Speaker 2: Flip Wilson.
Speaker 1: How was, how was it when they saw you, when they saw you because they are some old--
Speaker 2: See, but I had worked with a lot of them on '227.'
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Marla had a lot of people come through. I mean, when Flip Wilson came on the show--that was one of my favorite shows, "The Weather Girl" [sic. "The Talk Show"]. He had a certain way of doing a thing. And me, I didn't have the respect for him that I should have. Because I thought his, you know, his com- it's like now his style had gone out and I was doing my thing and he was trying to make me do his thing and I was like this works for me on here. You do what you do. You know, I was like--George Kirby, they had a different style of comedy.
Speaker 1: Some very senior veteran comedians.
Speaker 2: And they come trying tell you how to act. That's, you know, I've won the Emmy [Emmy Award] and everything. It's like--(laughter). You couldn't, um-hm. I was strong and they thought, oh, 'cause you're cute, you're weak. And you have to assert yourself.
Speaker 1: How was it behind the scene because I've had a chance to be behind the scene with a lot of old guys--Reynaldo Rey, then people--and they're really funny guys off, off-camera. Were, were you kind of sheltered from that and not really in that little--
Speaker 2: Child you ain't sheltered from nothing--show business? Huh. Um-hm.
Speaker 1: The catcalls from them because once they get started, it's pretty funny most times, isn't it?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: You know, but, but they still are hams. You gotta calm 'em down, you know, 'cause they'll take over.
Story_ID: 473813
Speaker 1: So 'The Royal Family' was gonna be a show that, you know, that really kind of was a spinoff of, of course, 'Sanford and Son' and all of that. And you had Della Reese [HistoryMaker Della Reese-Lett], very seasoned actresses and one fateful day Redd Foxx is on the set. You're there. You're all ready to shoot.
Speaker 2: Out of the dressing room--Redd, Redd Foxx came out of the dressing room to the set and died. I mean, it was immediate--turned gray. Della Reese grabbed his face and she talks about it 'cause she's close. She was right there. And she held him and started praying. And nobody quite knew what to do. It was very sudden.
Speaker 1: It's been said that he grabbed his heart but folks thought he was playing actually, the way he used to do--
Speaker 2: He'd done that be- earlier. This time just out, you know, real heart attack. I don't think people know. I--when people grab their chest, it's, it's never an artistic thing. It's like--I think Marlon Brando did it in 'The Godfather' good. You just--and it also seems like you grabbing it to stop it, not to, you know, for some reason.
Speaker 1: And so that, of course, ended that particular show or, or, or did the show go on?
Speaker 2: No, we went on, but not much longer. Six--
Speaker 1: The spirit was gone from this--
Speaker 2: Yeah, you know, some things go, some things don't.
Story_ID: 473814
Speaker 1: But it was fun getting to know her, getting to know Della Reese [HistoryMaker Della Reese-Lett]--great singer, great singer.
Speaker 2: Was she, was she a coach or mentor at all, I mean, even through--
Speaker 1: Yes, she still is. I love her to death. When I see her it's totally open arms--she and her husband Franklin [Franklin Lett]. I see her a lot at airports 'cause we're always traveling and we have the best--one time they shut down the airport [Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport] in Atlanta [Georgia] where we were for our, our group. But the entire time together--just having a wonderful time because she's just so warm, you know, just welcoming. She taught me how to do that and how to be humble at the same time--to be, to be f- fabulous and still modest and humble at the same time, you know.
Speaker 2: She's very optimistic too, optimistic lady.
Speaker 1: Very. She makes you feel good, you know. And like I said when I first met her she scared, she scared the living Jesus out of me. I was truly scared of her but I got to know her over the years. And when she takes you in--and she's got a great sense of humor, great sense of humor. She's one of the great ladies.  She--I have some great mentors--she, [HistoryMaker] Diahann Carroll, to some extent [HistoryMaker] Maya Angelou (makes noise) (laughter).
Speaker 2: Do you care, care to quickly, quickly talk about either, either of those--those are two great ladies.
Speaker 1: I'll--I love Diahann Carroll. Diahann Carroll--we used to live in a apartment building with her, my then husband, my third husband. I've been married three times--(makes noise) (laughter). The second one was a blur.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Third one was to a stylist, Elgin Charles, and we're still very close, very close. We have a son [Frank Charles], I have a son. And--what was I saying? Oh, Del- we were living in the building and Diahann Carroll lived upstairs in this building as did Sidney Poitier and his wife, Nikki Haskell, Robert Stack. I mean it was--
Speaker 2: I mean, you're in a star-studded building.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was sort of--I was staying there while my house was being built. So we're here and we're having a good time and I used to go and visit Diahann quite often. And she taught me so many things. She told me about pearls, how you can recognize the quality and, and she's witty and lovely and warm and, you know. And Miles Davis' ex-wife Frances [Frances Taylor Davis]--I met a great cadre of--I always like being around older women who, who are clever and witty and have been about something, you know, have had a life, even if it may not have been the life they chose. I always wondered why Diahann Carroll was so upset about 'Julia,' 'cause she was the first black woman doing a sitcom. And I went how could I be bad? There was no other per- there was no other show. She was out there all alone not knowing if it was being accepted, whatever. And I didn't think about that 'cause she's so wonderful, you know, so successful. But--and, and when you see her today still a bright light.
Speaker 2: Very stunning.
Speaker 1: Yes, stunning and tasteful.
Speaker 2: How about Ms. Angelou?
Speaker 1: She's tough. She can be a little rough. Oprah [Oprah Winfrey] loved her--that's her guru. But she can be tough. She's scary, so scary. I haven't come full circle with her. I don't know if we ever will, but who cares? I mean, you know, but she, she's a great lady, but she's tough. She's tough, tough on a girl.
Story_ID: 473815
Speaker 1: So you went through very different, various different, we'll call them gigs or jobs, and you, you got a role in a 'Designing Women' episode--did one of those. But then--
Speaker 2: I should have had that part, but I didn't get that. And it was the same thing. I should have known to back off. They had had Delta Burke. They, they were like you are the--no more women gonna be better than us, no more. And they were like, no, you can't come in here (laughter) and steal our show. She stole it already (laughter).
Speaker 1: So there's no more of that.
Speaker 2: Unh-uh.
Speaker 1: So in '94 [1994] there's a show called 'Sister, Sister' that gets started. That was a--
Speaker 2: I had a three-year break between jobs. I did not work for three solid years. People don't know that--between, you know, series.
Speaker 1: Like, yeah, between like '91 [1991] and '94 [1994].
Speaker 2: Ninety-three [1993] is when it happened--'Sister, Sister.' So from 1990 to 1993--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Zilch, you know.
Speaker 1: So how, how did 'Sister, Sister' come about? What happened with that?
Speaker 2: Suzanne de Passe was producing it, and they wanted a mother. And they called me and I went. And once again who was I up against? I want to say Sheryl Lee Ralph once again 'cause I was up against her for '227.' But she, Loretta [Loretta Devine], and I--we neck and neck, head to head for years until, you know, as things do, they end. But I got there and I went in and that was it (laughter). It was--
Speaker 1: So now this is a show, show where you're playing a mother.
Speaker 2: Playing a m- [HistoryMaker] Tim Reid is the father. I was not anxious to play a mother, no.
Speaker 1: Versus the temptress that--
Speaker 2: Right--
Speaker 1: --you, you've always been playing (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) that I've been playing all my life. At--and I'm like--I really was not happy about it at all, but gotta work. And I did not, you know, I didn't, I didn't even--maybe that's why I got it. I was (makes noise), you know, I didn't dislike it but it was something that I was not crazy about going to try to do. So we did it--just a couple of auditions. It was really easy. It was nice.
Speaker 1: So let's talk about a couple of those people on that, on that set. Namely Tim Reid, who has gone on to do more behind the scenes. Now he and his wife--
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: --Daphne [HistoryMaker Daphne Maxwell Reid]--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --my birth mate, same birthday.
Speaker 2: Really?
Speaker 1: Yeah, so Tim--
Speaker 2: She's a wonderful lady--
Speaker 1: Tim Reid don't have the same birthday.
Speaker 2: --I love her. Oh, no, I love Tim. Tim and I are real tight. I'm tight with he and Daphne.
Speaker 1: So how, so how was that on the set with him because he was--
Speaker 2: Great. No, we were great. The twins--I taught them everything they know. They were thirteen. Marques Houston was--what was he, ten. I mean, they grew up before my eyes, but--
Speaker 1: And the twins were thirteen. Now, now that had seen Jackee [HistoryMaker Jackee Harry].
Speaker 2: Yeah, but they didn't--yeah, they knew her from Sandra [Sandra Clark], but I taught those girls everything they know, and they got it together and they are on their own. Tamera [Tamera Mowry-Housley] writes more than her sister Tia [Tia Mowry-Hardrict]. She creates more 'cause she was the one that created the series, 'Sister, Sister,' for she and her sister. And she's come up with other stuff for them, you know, a movie they did, 'The Witch's Switch' [sic. 'Twitches']. She's a real bright, bright kid. And Tia's on 'The Game,' which is on The CW [The CW Television Network]. They, they're beautiful young ladies. I'm so proud of them and--
Speaker 1: So are you still in contact with them?
Speaker 2: Absolutely, absolutely--
Speaker 1: How about Tim and Daphne?
Speaker 2: Absolutely, yeah, I mean, really warm. It's f- it's fun when you get a series and you really--I, but I know them, you know what I mean. When you really know somebody and you like 'em. It's like Della [HistoryMaker Della Reese-Lett]. I see her. I don't, I don't pretend I like some people, but I ain't, I don't want they phone number (laughter). I like you--I don't want your phone number.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Story_ID: 473816
Speaker 1: So you continue to go through different things over the years and you've been in a lot of different, different parts here and there. And now you're, you're in one now--oh, I gotta backup on this--here's one--'That's So Raven.'
Speaker 2: I loved it (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You did a episode on that, that, that--
Speaker 2: I was supposed to be a regular on that but I don't know what happened.
Speaker 1: Now, now let's, let's talk about Raven [Raven-Symone] as a young lady. How is she?
Speaker 2: Raven is very bright, very smart. Her mother's [Lydia Gaulden Pearman] very smart, you know. Her father [Christopher Pearman] wasn't there so much when I was there. Very giving--our humor I found to be a lot alike. She would never admit to that. And I'm not, not asking her to. I mean, she might. But it's a lot alike. She, but she's got her own flavor, don't get me wrong. But the energy is a lot alike.
Speaker 1: Do you think it's very possible as you used to emulate that she may have emulated because she would have definitely seen and been able to have a access to Jackee [HistoryMaker Jackee Harry]?
Speaker 2: I think so. She would never admit it. I mean, I got Kym Whitley--you know Kym Whitley from 'Next Friday.' She says that she's my professional stalker.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: And peo- people say, "Oh, she's copying you." I said, "Well, I don't do it anymore, so, I mean, I copied Lucy [Lucille Ball]. I mean, come on," you know.
Speaker 1: It's all imitation and, and, and just emulation. And you've been on a few things like the VH1 [Video Hits One; VH1], the 'Fit Club' ['Celebrity Fit Club'] where you lost thirty-nine pounds on that.
Speaker 2: Can you believe that?
Speaker 1: Tell us about that particular show.
Speaker 2: I did not want to do a reality show. They called me the first time for the very first one and I was like I'm not fat enough for that. And I guess I was under some gross misapprehensions that I was Ms. Fine. And I was--I ain't doing--and hung up the phone. The next time they said, "Jackee, please." I said, well, I wasn't doing anything. I said hey, why not? Make a little change. I was like how much? Oh, ooh, ooh--but then I thought about it soon as I hung up the phone. I was like--'cause it's personal. Losing weight is a personal thing. And sure enough that's what a reality show is and people don't understand that. A reality show means, yeah, we know what the situation is. We know where we're going. But I'm sitting up talking to you now there comes a point when your human thing kicks in and if you can't stand somebody or like 'em, you gonna, you gonna say it. It's gonna kick in or whatever and you're gonna be you. You can't fake it without a script (laughter). You just can't. Gary Busey--it was horrible, horrible. And not eating--it was 101 days. It's hard and I wanted to win. I wanted to win. I always want to win. And I want that extra money 'cause you got extra money for winning. But I wanted to win, and it was very difficult being with him. He was very, very scary, very rude.
Speaker 1: I don't necessarily recall any of his shows, but I heard that it was (laughter) some instances.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and he never--it--like I'm talking to you now. He could be charming but you know the maniac was coming and another was--had a little drug problem and another girl was a liar, you know, just--I was like whoever does this, I don't think they underst- it's like 'Dancing with the Stars' when I saw Marie Osmond fall. I said people don't understand that it's real. That's the reality. That why we watch it. They say why do we watch? To see you fail. And that's what 'Celebrity Fit'--we want to see you fail. If you make it, then we love it. But we really are watching to see you fall on your face.
Speaker 1: Would you do another reality show now probably?
Speaker 2: Ooh, yes, but--
Speaker 1: Not necessarily weight loss, but just a reality show.
Speaker 2: Yeah, but it'd have to be something I could really handle 'cause like they want me do a dating show. And I'm like if I really like a guy, I'm not gonna put us on screen 'cause I am not Jessica Simpson and he is not Nick Lick, Lock, Lickey, Lockey--no, Lachey? Is it Lachey [Nick Lachey]?
Speaker 1: Um-hm, right.
Speaker 2: You don't know, do you? Nobody cares, see.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter) But when I saw her I was like if you put your personal life on, you're not gonna make it. Fir- marriage is hard as it is.
Speaker 1: It--because it's kind of scripted.
Speaker 2: Yeah, but--
Speaker 1: --and you can't really do it--
Speaker 2: Yeah, he wasn't comfortable.
Story_ID: 473817
Speaker 1: So you've gone through a lot of things over the years and now you're still acting, you're still doing a lot of acting. And what are you currently involved in?
Speaker 2: 'Everybody Hates Chris.' I got a--I, I recur on there. And I'm doing a play.
Speaker 1: How's that show because, because--
Speaker 2: The best. The best time--
Speaker 1: Chris Rock made executive producer, one of the producers.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh and Ali LeRoi is his executive producer and he's a young African American male--wonderful. I'd work with him anywhere, any day. He's just cool. Just a cool brother, you know. Just all right, you know, but smart and witty and funny and low-key--sort of like you, but even more so, you know, from New York [New York]--he and his wife [Adrienne LeRoi] and his kids--they're cool. And the cast--I love Tichina Arnold to death. She's funny and smart and Terry Crews--he's just--and the kids--they're just--it's like a family, but they, they're cool. You want to be there with them, you know. 'Cause I was on a show with Whoopi one time and we just had a ball. I love [HistoryMaker] Whoopi Goldberg. That's another one. I want to call her a mentor but she's not really. She's only a mentor in terms of the fact that politically I wish I could be like her. I wish I could be a political satirist and aware like that and be funny about it--I'm not, I'm, I'm not, I'm not a clever girl like that. But watching her, talking to her even on 'The View,' which to me is not enough for her wit--you know, they're lucky to have her 'cause she's really bright and really courageous, you know. But she knows what she's talking about.
Speaker 1: And still be--and she's very much Whoopi. She's her--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, you know. And if you don't get to know her, then too bad for you 'cause everybody's, oh, she's not black enough, she's not this. She's from Berkeley [California], she's a whole other different being. But when you're with her you know just who she is.
Speaker 1: Exactly. You're also into stage plays now. Tell us what's going on now that you're doing.
Speaker 2: No, I've been doing stage plays all my life.
Speaker 1: No, I'm saying now currently.
Speaker 2: Oh, 'Damn Yankees.' I'm doing a multi-ethnic, multi-cultural version directed by Jason Alexander with the extra script changes by Jason Alexander. And trust me from 'Seinfeld'--
Speaker 1: George [George Costanza].
Speaker 2: Jason, yes, and he is in charge, okay. And he's doing a great job. He's the artistic director of the Reprise Broadway group [Reprise Theatre Company]. They do musicals, classic musicals and they redo them and present them. And I'm in 'Damn Yankees' and me, [HistoryMaker] Armelia McQueen--she's an African American--[HistoryMaker] Ken Page--they're both from 'Ain't Misbehavin'' [Murray Horwitz and Richard Maltby, Jr.]. Cleavant Derricks, the original James "Thunder" Early from 'Dreamgirls, and Lillias White, who's a fabulous singer--you'd have to know when you see her. She sings--got the voice of an angel. And we're the principals and that's very rare. There have never been black principals in 'Damn Yankees,' never.
Speaker 1: And how are you enjoying this role?
Speaker 2: Oh, I'm enjoying it. It's a lot of work, though. He got me dancing--I'm too old for that.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: Sitting her now going what, why, my knees, my--but it's a lot of fun. The young people love the chorus, the ensembles--they don't let me say chorus--the ensemble. They, they (laughter) like it. They're very, very energetic. And so a mix--Asian, Latino. It's a really, really great group of people. It's a good, good feeling.
Story_ID: 473818
Speaker 1: Well, now, how do you feel about the way that you've lived your life? What's important to you?
Speaker 2: Well, what's important to me now is finding happiness. I'm not very happy right now as we speak. I'm not unhappy, but I haven't found a serenity that I crave. And I'm, I'm trying to find it. And I guess it's, I think it's normal. Everybody tells me it is quite normal when you get to a certain age to, to want to chill, you know. You kind of just want to be less, less anxiety, less hassle, and just be in a place where you, you, you, you can move on with the next phase. 'Cause we get to fifty--now you got to figure out what to do with the next fifty. It ain't like it used to be. Fifty--you'd be dead, you're done. You know when I was growing up everybody was dying early. You kind of expected it. But now people are living and living energetically. So it's like you can do a third career. So I'm on my third career I think which will be writing if not teaching again.
Story_ID: 473819
Speaker 1: For those that are going into the, we'll, we'll say the, the entertainment business, what suggestions do you have for them?
Speaker 2: Same old boring--study, study first. Do not think that natural technique will sustain you throughout a career. Will Smith I use an, as an example. He, when he first started it was all natural, raw talent. He had to go back when he did 'Six Degrees of Separation' he had to go back and take acting lessons and he's still taking them. Because you can't make it without knowledge 'cause you're not going to feel everything when you act. Some of it's technique. You just can't--so study, love it to death, absolutely--200 percent love it 'cause if you don't, you're not gonna make it at all. And don't, don't get caught up in the American Idol-itis, you know. Don't, don't think it's, don't do it for fame, you know. If you're doing it for fame then you'll be like Britney [Britney Spears], you'll be like the ones that get out there and they, they fail.
Speaker 1: You will be famous.
Speaker 2: And that's it. You'll be an empty shell. And that's what happened to me. I had a lot of great streaks of luck and I made a lot of money, but I, I'll honestly say to you I had a great time, but as I look back I wish I had calmed down more earlier and enjoyed it more 'cause it was like a streak.
Speaker 1: Would you choose a different career path?
Speaker 2: Yes. You notice I answered that immediately. Yes, had I known, I would have. I would have stayed and become a teacher. I would have 'cause this business is crazy. This is crazy.
Speaker 1: What do you still want to do that you haven't done yet?
Speaker 2: I would like to get married and have a happy marriage. You know, I had a happy marriage before, though. I, I, I'm just not good at staying around long. You know, after three years--so, so getting back to my first husband [Jerry Jemmott], I kind of wandered. I, I mean I didn't mess around but kind of want my career more than I want a personal life.
Speaker 1: Emotionally wanted it.
Speaker 2: Yeah. I'm a work, yeah, a workaholic.
Story_ID: 473820
Speaker 1: What are you hopes and concerns for the African American community?
Speaker 2: I hope that black women get on TV and films more. We're sort of disappearing. We're like accent pieces. We used to be all over the tube and I'm like where are we? Are we disappearing? And I would like women in general--black, white, Hispanic--to be more empowered meaning be who you are and who you, who you say you are. It's like Hillary Clinton [Hillary Rodham Clinton] who I love, I adore--be who you are, wrong, right, and don't apologize. Men never do. But they're taught to do that early. We're not. We try to please. And I did it for so many years and I'm just now getting to a point where I don't feel bad when I mess up. It's like, yeah, I messed up, so? Let's try again, you know. So I'd like women to be stronger for real. Don't fake it.
Story_ID: 473821
Speaker 1: When you look back at your life, what stands out the most for you?
Speaker 2: That's a good one. I don't--I'm not finished. Nothing has really stood out. I've done some stuff that, you know, people think is great, but I haven't done anything to me that really stands out yet. It's sort of like--maybe that's what stands out (laughter).
Speaker 1: There's still more time.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: What value do you consider most important in a person and why?
Speaker 2: Loyalty, loyalty. Don't block anybody's good--you know, no matter how mad I am at anybody, I don't block their, their blessings. Don't be evil, don't be negative for real. You know, I can be wicked--I love being wicked, I love saying wicked things but in my heart I never wish anybody any ill will. I don't care--I could talk about my first husband [Jerry Jemmott] or somebody's who done me wrong. I don't wish them ill because they have a life to live, too, you know, unless you put your hands on me (laughter).

Speaker 1: How do you want to be, to be remembered, your legacy? What do you want your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: I don't know. You know, I don't think about things like that because I, I just want to have one. I see people doing great things. I haven't really done anything great to me. You know, you gotta--and I'm not looking to do a great thing. But I am--I'm looking to be a hero like everybody else. I'd love to invent cancer by, I mean, what do you call it--get the cure for cancer by mistake. I'd love to walk in and be the guinea pig and they discover (laughter)--you know I would love to do something like that. I would love to help cure something.

Speaker 1: Why do you think history is important?
Speaker 2: Because it lets you know what happened and, and why. I'm, I'm c- cur- curiosity--I can't get enough of it. I want to know--it's like if the Japanese had continued bombing Pearl Harbor [Naval Station Pearl Harbor, Hawaii], we wouldn't be sitting here now. They didn't even know that they had made that much of an impact. They just used all the stuff they had and they went back. If they had--they pulled them back 'cause were like we got the ships. They didn't realize if they kept going, we would, the whole naval base would have been wiped out. We, ooh, did you hear that? We never would have been able to recover, you know, things like that. I want to know why history goes down the way it does and then use it in the future, you know. And I like people to know.
Speaker 1: Why did you want to tell your story?
Speaker 2: Because I think I do have a legacy. I'm just not aware of it right now as I sit and talk to you. I'm, I'm sort of living my life. I'm not looking like--oh, I'm famous. I mean I can get great seats in restaurants--I can't get 'em every restaurant, I'll tell you that--Mr. Chow. Anyway, I, I went (laughter) and I said, look--the first time she asked me I was like--I was dating somebody--I didn't want to talk about it. Then I said, well, why not? Somebody might look at this and, and think it's useful--why not?
Speaker 1: Well, I want to thank you for telling your story and the life that you've led and, and all the great entertainment you've given us over the years. And I want to thank you for this interview and thank you for being Jackee [HistoryMaker Jackee Harry].
Speaker 2: Thank you.
