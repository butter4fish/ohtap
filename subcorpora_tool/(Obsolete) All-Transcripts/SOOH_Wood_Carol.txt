 Finchum  Wood  Today is June 11, 2010. My name is Tanya Finchum, and I   m with  Oklahoma State University Library. We   re conducting an oral history  project called Women Extension Educators. Today I   m in Bartlesville,  Oklahoma, to speak with Carol Wood who began with Extension in 1970  and retired in 2001. During that entire time she worked in Washington  County. Thank you for joining us today. Let   s start with having you tell  us a little bit about your childhood.  I was born in Enterprise, Haskell County, Oklahoma, and lived there for  a number of years. My father, at that time, was a farmer. My mother was  seventeen years old when I was born. I was the first of four. My  youngest sister was born when I was sixteen, so we kind of had two  families there. I started to school, in the primary grade, at five years old  at Enterprise, Oklahoma. The first thing we learned was the Pledge of  Allegiance to the flag, and the teacher said that we should teach this, and  I took her literally. I went home and sat my two younger sisters down,  who were a year and a half and three years younger than myself, and  taught them the Pledge of Allegiance. And I think from that time I knew  I was going to be a teacher of some kind. We lived there for awhile. We  lived in Haskell County a lot.  Things weren   t going so well on the farm, so we went to California for  awhile. We came back to Oklahoma, settled in Whitefield, Oklahoma,  which is still in Haskell County, and that   s where we lived most of the  time, in my younger years. And that   s where I learned about 4-H. When  I was in the fourth grade the county agent and the home demonstration  agent came to our school to organize a 4-H club, and that was my first  experience with 4-H, the first time I   d heard about it. Those agents really  impressed me. I don   t know if it was the nice clothes the lady was  wearing, or the car they were driving, but at that time, in my mind, I  knew that   s what I wanted to do sometime. It was a far-fetched dream. I  had no idea how to get there, but I just thought that would be a  5  Finchum  Wood  Finchum  Wood  Finchum  Wood  Finchum  Wood  Finchum  Wood  Finchum  Wood  Finchum  Wood  wonderful job to have. I was in 4-H until I was out of high school. Most  of my projects were demonstration and sewing. That was my two main  projects.  Fourth grade, so you would   ve been about ten years old?  I would   ve been probably nine or ten, I think. Probably nine.  Had your mother had much to do with homemaker clubs?  Not at that time. But later on a home demonstration club was organized  in the community and she was a member of that. She was a member of  that organization until she died. On two occasions she was president of  her county organization.  Do you remember the name of her club?  The first club she was in was just called the Whitefield Home  Demonstration Club. The last club that she was in was called the Eager  Beavers Extension Homemakers Group. And most of them lived around  Beaver Mountain, which is also known as Mountain Home, which is  south of Whitefield, between Whitefield and Kinta.  And you grew up on the farm a little bit?  A little bit. We grew up on the farm. We always had cows, at least one  cow, and a horse. The first gift I remember from my dad was a colt. I  wasn   t very old, probably three or four. The horse that he had had a colt,  and that became mine. As it grew up, he liked to rope, so he used it as a  roping horse.  So your 4-H came in handy a little bit in raising the     Well, see, that was a long time before I ever knew about 4-H. That was  later on when I was a little bit older that 4-H came in.  Did you ever have to kill a chicken yourself?  Oh yes. Oh yes. We had chickens, and it was so exciting to me when I  got to the point that I could kill the chicken and cook the chicken all by  myself. That was probably about age ten or twelve.  Did you have a method for killing?  Yeah, you   d wring the neck.  6  Finchum  Wood  Finchum  Wood  Finchum  Wood  Finchum  Wood  Finchum  Wood  Finchum  Wood  People do it differently, that   s why I ask.  Yes, yes they do, but my grandmother always wrung the neck. My  mother did too and that   s what I did. And we always had hogs, so dad  always butchered a hog. Our Thanksgivings were usually spent, at that  time of my life, hog killing.  Cool enough to do it.  Cool enough to do it.  Did you then smoke the ham or can it or     No, he smoked it. He cured it. I   m not sure that he smoked it. I  remember helping to cut up all of the fat, putting it in a large black  washtub over a fire and melting it down to make lard. That was the lard,  that was the shortening that we used until the next hog killing time, until  the next November. And usually it   d be about ten gallons, I think.  And then store that in the     And then stored that in the cellar, or in a cool place, wherever there was  a cool place.  Any electricity at the farm at that time?  No. No electricity, no running water. We did not have electricity until  the REA  Rural Electric Association  came into being. I don   t remember  that year, but that was an exciting time when we had electric lights. We  still didn   t have running water. We still went to the well to get water and  carried it back to the house for whatever we needed it for.  And then you graduated from high school in what year?  I graduated from high school in 1956. Finished the eighth grade at  Whitefield, and we had a graduation program there. Then all the smaller  schools were consolidated into the Stigler School System, and I attended  Stigler School ninth grade and tenth grade. By then we were not on the  farm. Dad was working for the county. Sometime in between there, even  when we were on the farm during WWII, he worked at the ammunitions  depot in McAlester. He worked at an ammunition place in Pryor, I  believe it was, and we lived in Wagoner during that time. I was just real  small, but I still remember where we lived there.  The summer before eleventh grade, he was working on highway  construction work as a heavy duty bulldozer operator and we moved to  7  Finchum  Wood  Finchum  Wood  Talihina. I went to school there for the first semester. He helped build  the road between Talihina over into Arkansas through Muse. At the time  we went down there, that was the state highway, but it was really like a  cow track, you know, like you   d been driving the truck down. We were  there about one semester, then his job changed. Still the same job, but  the company was working on another construction place, and we moved  to Wewoka. We lived there until the end of my junior year, and then we  moved back to Whitefield. Well, we lived in Oklahoma City for a little  while because he was working on I-35, I believe it was.  Then when that job ended we went back to Whitefield for awhile, and I  started my senior year at Stigler. His job took him to Claremore, where  he was working on the Will Rogers Turnpike, and I didn   t want to move.  I wanted to stay at Stigler and finish school there, and my parents  allowed me to do that. I lived for a little while with my aunt and uncle  out in the rural area. Then I moved in with my grandmother, which was  in an even more rural area, and lived with her until I graduated. The  night I graduated, my dad had just been transferred from Claremore on  his job to Poteau, so I moved back home then. We lived in Poteau. I had  applied for some scholarships at Eastern Oklahoma A M, and received  a vocal music scholarship. That   s where I started college was at  Wilburton at Eastern A M.  In home economics?  Yes. I started with a double major with home economics and vocal  music. I had kind of always wanted to go to OU, because all I   d heard  was the OU football games and that sort of thing. Well, my dad wasn   t  for that at all. When it came time for me to go to college he said,    No,  you will go to OSU, and you   ll major in home economics just like your  cousin Imogene did.    And so that   s what I did.  And that would   ve been when?  It was actually three years later that I got to OSU. I got my associate of  science at Eastern  Oklahoma  A M. I applied for a job with the group   Student Entertainers  that sang at OSU. Their job was to go out to  different communities. Ashley Alexander was the head of that and he   d  asked me to come up and do an audition. But before I did that, the motor  went out of my dad   s car and he had no way to go to work. He had to get  that motor fixed, so I didn   t go to school that year. I stayed out of  school, got a job. Then a year and a half later in January of 1960 I  started to OSU. I completed my work at OSU for a bachelor   s by going  three semesters and a summer. It meant that I had to take eighteen and  nineteen hours each semester, but it was saving me living money, you  know, dorm rent and that kind of thing.  8  Finchum  Wood  Finchum  Wood  Finchum  Wood  No time to sing, then.  No, no time to sing. No. No, not then.  So you graduated in     I graduated in 1961.  Did you do time in the practice house or the home management house?  I did. I lived at the Monroe Home Management House and I believe our  teacher there was Mrs. McAlister, but I   m not sure about that name. It  was a different experience. Each week we were in charge of something  different. I remember that was the first time I had ever eaten parsnips,  and I didn   t really care for them. The instructor had some allergies to  eggs, and so that was one thing that we did not use, or if we did, we  fixed something different for her when we were the cook. But that   parsnips  was one thing that she thought we should all try, and we did,  and it was a good experience.  While I was living there, I met the man that was to be my husband. I was  very active in the BSU  Baptist Student Union  program at OSU, and  they were doing some weekend revivals. I sing a lot at church and I went  out with a group whenever a group went out and did special music.  That   s where I met my husband.  I fully went to OSU with the idea that the only job I wanted was to work  in a county extension office, to be an extension agent. I interviewed for  that position, and they talked favorably to me. In those days you were  not encouraged to get married, although ladies were starting to get  married and still worked for the organization. There were not a lot of  vacancies the year that I graduated. There was a vacancy in Coal  County, where I could start as an associate agent, but by that time I   d  become engaged to my husband, and I didn   t want to go that far away  from Stillwater. So I turned that down, and after graduation we got  married in June. I met him in February, we got engaged in May, and we  got married in June. Later this month we   ll celebrate forty-nine years.  So I interviewed for teaching jobs in the vicinity of Stillwater. None of  those panned out, but there was an opening at the Registrar   s office on  campus. I had worked as a proctor in the dorm while I was there, so they  hired me at the Registrar   s office. I worked as a clerk there making  transcripts and whatever they needed done. When I took the job they  said,    Now, are you going to go looking for a teaching job?    And I said,     No. Teaching jobs haven   t panned out. This is where I plan to be as  long as he is in school, or at least for a good while.     9  One day a man came into my office and introduced himself as Ross  Duckett. He was the new superintendent at Perkins. He was looking for  a home economics teacher. It was about three weeks before school was  to start. His wife was scheduled to teach home economics, vocational  home economics, but she really preferred elementary grades. She could  teach elementary, there was an opening that came up there, if he could  find a home economics teacher. I said,    I   m sorry, Mr. Duckett. I can   t  do that. I told them I would be here, and I can   t change.    He kept  coming back and he kept coming back, and finally I said,    I   ll go in and  talk with them.    And two weeks before school started, he hired me to  teach vocational home economics at Perkins. I had no lesson plans, it  had been a little while since I   d done student teaching (six months at  least), but we made it through. I had the nicest group of girls, and the  nicest people to work with. They became like my daughters. I was there  for three years, and I left there because I was pregnant. I didn   t want to  be a full-time employed mother. I wanted to be a full-time mother.  My husband was managing the Perkins Journal during part of this time,  and he had students that worked for him there. I remember when we  were cleaning the department the last year that I was there. We were out  in a little cottage, and we had a stove that smoked up the ceiling. I had  the students clean the ceiling, wash the ceiling down, before school was  out so we could leave everything in good order. I climbed up on the  table to help them. They didn   t like that at all. By noon they were down  telling my husband that I was up climbing on the tables, and I didn   t  need to do that when I was six months pregnant, but we survived it.  I left there. He took a ministerial job, a pastoral job in Lamont, and was  working at the newspaper in Blackwell. That   s where we were when our  son was born. Then we left there and a job in Bartlesville opened up for  him. I didn   t really like Lamont. I loved the people. They were  wonderful people, but I grew up in Southeastern Oklahoma where  there   s hills and trees. I wasn   t used to having a wheat field in my  backyard, and I wasn   t used to having lamb pens next door to the  parsonage. When we brought our son home, his cry was very much like  the lambs. If I were sitting out on the back porch, I couldn   t tell if it  were my baby crying or the lambs, sometimes.  So, we interviewed here, and came to Bartlesville as the reporter. A little  while after we moved here, there was an opening at the extension office  in Dewey. I wanted to apply for it, and he didn   t want me to. There was  something going on that he just didn   t want me to get involved in,  personnel wise, I think. That was on his beat and, you know, as a beat  reporter he would go up and see them every week and get acquainted  with everybody. But no, he didn   t think this was the right time for me to  go applying for a job there, so I didn   t.  10  I did substitute teaching in Bartlesville, I sold Tupperware, I worked in  the church, I taught vacation bible school and things like that. Then we  had another daughter. During this time I did some substitute teaching out  at a little community that   s northwest of here called Bowring. They  called me one day and one of their teachers, I think it was a sixth grade  teacher, had broken a leg and was going to have to be off work for six  weeks, and they needed somebody to teach his classes. There was more  than one grade in the class, as I recall, so I took it. I was teaching  everything, things that I had never taught before, like math. I was not  very good in math, but I was fortunate enough that the math teacher and  the English teacher were sisters. They lived in Bartlesville, and I  commuted with them every day, and every day after school and going  back to school she taught me the lesson for the next day, for the math  class. This was when the new math was in, and we all survived it. It was  interesting.  Then in 1970, Nadine Holder, who had been here for about thirty years,  as the extension agent with the adult program, retired, and I needed a  job. We had two young children, and his salary was not really paying the  bills every month. I was getting a headache every time I was deciding  what bill to pay. So I called up and talked to Walter Beckham, who was  the county extension director at the time, and asked about it. He talked to  me. He gave me a very specific idea of what would be required of  whoever came to this job, and actually it ended up being a 4-H home  economist   s job, because the 4-H home economist moved to the adult  program when Miss Holder retired. He did not sugar coat the job at all,  and I appreciated that. He said,    Okay. I   ll get back with you.     He called me one morning, must   ve been about twelve-thirty or one. He  said,    Our district director Charlie Burns is here, and he would like for  you to come up and talk to him about this job. Can you come up this  afternoon and meet with us?    And I said,    Yes.    He said,    What time  can you be here?    I said,    I can be there by three o   clock.    I thought it  was twelve-thirty or earlier. It was closer to one-thirty. I had two  children to get dressed, myself to get dressed, and get those children to  day care. I walked into the Extension office right exactly at three  o   clock, huffing. I went in and visited with them for about an hour and a  half, and they said,    Well, we   ll get back to you.    I thought,    Oh, I   m  probably not going to hear from this.    I was just very outspoken in my  answers to their questions, but I really needed the job.  I had applied with Public Service, because there was an opening there  for a home economist a few weeks before, but I wasn   t the one selected  for that job. I was really disappointed, so I just prayed. I said,    God, I  need a job.    Then this one became available in Dewey. A few days later,  they called me back and said,    Can you be in Stillwater on a certain day  11  Finchum  Wood  Finchum  Wood  Finchum  Wood  Finchum  Wood  to meet with the personnel people and sign your papers?    And I said,    I  think I can.    At that time, the Public Service home economist   s job was  going to pay like  450 a month. Well, the Extension job they offered me  was  650 a month. That   s what the monthly salary was at that time for  that position.  For full time?  For full time. And so I accepted the job. The day that I had to go to  Stillwater to fill out all the paperwork was the most horrible rainstorm I  have ever driven through. Now, I knew I   d have to be driving if I took  this job. I would be doing it in all kinds of weather, because you do  whatever you need to do to get the job done. I was the person that didn   t  even like to drive to Ochelata, which was ten miles away from here, by  myself after dark. And I   d never driven in Tulsa. I hadn   t been on the  Stillwater campus in probably five or six years, and there   d been some  changes there. I did know where the Ag Hall was, so I drove over there  in this downpour, met with Mr. Casey, and signed all my papers. I went  to work at the first of October 1970, here in Washington County.  Where was your office?  My office was in the same building it is now. Basically, at that time,  there was a large room that the two home economists shared, and we had  a folding wall between us that we could close if we wanted to. There  was a desk, a filing cabinet, a chair, maybe a couple of large filing  cabinets and a two-drawer filing cabinet by my desk. That was what was  there.  And a phone, I guess?  And a phone.  No computer?  No. Oh no. And the person who   d had the job before me and moved to  the adult program was very, very helpful. She stayed in that position for  a year. Her husband worked for Phillips and he was transferred to  England, so she resigned and they moved to England, and so the job  opened up for the adult home economist. Well, of course, I applied for it,  but I didn   t get it. The person that was hired for the job came here from  Iowa. She had owned a dress shop in Iowa, and she had a sister who was  an extension agent in Sallisaw, and she was the one that was hired for  the job. She stayed here for a year. She had some wonderful ideas for the  adult program.  12  Finchum  Wood  When Miss Holder was here, the extension groups, the home  demonstration clubs were her main job. That took her whole time, and  she did everything for them, from filling out reports. When Connie  French moved to that position, and was there for a year, she didn   t make  many changes, if any. She   d still go over and get all the party dishes out  at the fair building when it was time for the Christmas tea, and be sure  the tablecloths were there. A committee person would come and put  everything together. She   d buy the groceries and, you know, whatever  needed to be done for the special meetings they   d have there.  Patsy Rogers was here for a year, and then she got married and resigned.  Patsy had some wonderful ideas. She was a really forward thinker, but  the women were not quite ready for that because they weren   t used to  that. You know, if you   ve ever worked with a group, sometimes you   ve  got to just put out an idea and wait for it to come back as somebody  else   s idea. She was here for a year. Then I applied for it again when she  retired, and they moved me to the adult position from 4-H, and that   s  where I stayed. I didn   t make a whole lot of changes for awhile, because  I knew what had gone on in the past. Gradually, I started doing a lot of  leadership training, and so much that my district home economist was  saying,    Do you think you really need this much?     By the time that I retired, the extension homemakers could conduct their  own business meeting. They could do their work if I weren   t there, and  that was my goal, and that was the goal that everybody was wanting for  that organization, I think, at the time, too. So they just did their thing,  and when I did retire, I felt really comfortable that if it took awhile to  find somebody for that position, because sometimes it might be a year or  six months, depending on what the job market was like, and to get the  right fit, or the fit that the people in charge of hiring would want, they  were doing their own thing, and I was right there helping them. We took  two trips to Washington, D.C., to 4-H Center, and learned a lot about  government and about our country. The committees planned some other  educational tours. They   d always had an educational tour committee,  and they   d do maybe one tour a year.  How many clubs were there when you first started?  When I came to work here, when Nadine Holder retired, there was  thirty-one clubs. There was about thirty by the time I was here, and we  lost some, occasionally, that merged with another group. Then as we  went through the thirty years that I was here, some of our older clubs,  their members were to the place that they weren   t as able to continue the  work as they had done at one time. Now there are six groups, I think.  Times have changed. The responsibility of the extension educator has  changed, and it started changing awhile before I retired.  13  Finchum  Wood  Finchum  Wood  Can you give us     Some of those changes?  Some idea.  Yes. We were working with not just women. When Miss Holder was  here it was mostly not a lot of urban clubs. There was several, but this is  not really a farm county, it   s more of an urban county. I got acquainted  with any family-serving agency in the county that I could, and did some  teaching with them and for them for their clientele. I worked with the  YWCA, I worked with Eldercare, I worked with the health department,  and I worked with child care agencies through the person at DHS, the  licensing person. We had in Bartlesville at that time, and we probably  still do but it probably has a different name, a group that met together  that was the Council of Social Agencies. I joined that group, and worked  with people like the person in charge of the Concern Center here, or  Salvation Army, and did programming for anybody that wanted  something that I could offer.  When I first went to work, I taught sewing workshops. That was the  thing I enjoyed teaching the most. I researched, wrote, and presented a  training session every month for the leaders of the extension homemaker  groups. They always had a lesson at their monthly meeting. The vice  presidents would come in at a certain time of the year after they   d polled  their members about,    What kind of lessons do you want next year?  What are the subjects that you want?    And we   d write them all on the  blackboard, and then all the vice presidents would vote for their group.  That   s how we   d choose the eleven lessons for the year. We didn   t do  one in December. That was left open for a Christmas program. I would  research and write a different lesson every month, and that took a little  time.  Then we started getting a little more specialized, after awhile. The first  year that we were doing this, my area of emphasis was stress  management, and that type of thing. Wayne Matthews was the state  specialist that was overseeing that. That   s kind of what I tried to gear   toward , but I still was doing different lessons. Sometimes we   d have  state specialists that would have lessons available that we could use, but  most of the time we had to adapt them to our audience.  Then at a certain point in time, and I don   t remember when we did this, I  joined forces with the extension educator in Tulsa and Nowata and  Rogers County, and we divided up the lessons. We were doing more  teaching for outside groups. Our audience was not just the extension  homemakers anymore, so we joined forces. We would solicit ideas from  14  Finchum  Wood  Finchum  Wood  Finchum  Wood  the members in each of our counties, and then we   d put them all  together, send the list out to our group, or we might even start in our  county with the things that they wanted. Then we   d take the vice  president from each of the counties to a special meeting, and they would  select the eleven lessons, twelve lessons because we   d go ahead and do  January at the same time, that we would teach. The four of us educators  would divide the topics so that we were doing just four lessons, usually,  or three or four lessons.  At first I would teach the lesson in my county, and then I would go to  Tulsa County that afternoon and teach the lesson there, or I might teach  it one afternoon in my county, and I might go to Tulsa the next morning,  and then go to Rogers County that afternoon, and then Nowata County.  We   d do two counties a day for two days. Then we got to the point that  we chose a central location and we   d ask our leaders to come there. We  chose Owasso, because that was available to us and it was easy to get  there from all four counties, at the First Assembly of God Church. We   d  have four lessons going at one time. That way we could do it all in one  morning and not have to travel so much. That worked pretty good, and I  think they   re still doing that today.  It took a little planning.  It took some planning, and it took a while before we had four agents that  were all four ready to do this. We might   ve had two of us ready to do it  at one time, but the other two were not quite sure. It took a little time for  our clientele to be ready for this, too. It wasn   t something that we just  threw out to them and said,    This is what we   re going to do and it   s  starting tomorrow.    It was something we talked about in our counties for  awhile. Of course, in each case we always had people that did not come  to the central lesson, but they   d come to the office and pick up the  material. For whatever reason they couldn   t make it that day.  Would other counties have that large a number of groups?  Tulsa had a pretty large number. They had as many as we did. Nowata  County had, I   d say they maybe had a dozen groups. Rogers County had  more than that, and Tulsa County and Washington County had pretty  close to the  same . Tulsa may have had more than we did by this time,  because I didn   t have thirty groups at this time. It was probably twenty-five  or twenty.  So we   re talking about fifty to seventy-five people?  We   d have fifty to seventy-five people when we had them all together.  Each group would send a leader, or two leaders if they wanted to, to the  15  Finchum  Wood  training sessions. It worked out really good, and they   re still doing it  today.  Well in the early, early days, did you do demonstrations on canning or  freezing or     Oh yes, and I did more of them in the later days than I did the earlier  days, almost. I did some canning classes. In the earlier days, Kerr Glass  was located down at Sand Springs, and they had a home economist there  that did canning. She would come out to the areas. She came out and  taught some canning classes for me. She   d do training classes for us, and  then we would do it. I remembered helping my mother can. My job was  usually to wash the jars, because I had the smaller hands when I was  growing up. We taught canning classes. I taught a lot of sewing classes.  The first time I remember a microwave oven was when I was teaching at  Perkins and somebody from OG E, I believe, came out to see me. They  would give my school and my department X amount of money if I  would allow them to bring their microwave in for a day and use it. I  don   t remember if someone from OG E was there or if they just left it  and we cooked on it. My superintendent, of course, was willing to do  this. I remember the first time they brought it in. At that time microwave  ovens were only used in certain restaurants, and they were very, very  expensive. We bought every hotdog in town that day cooking hotdogs,  and people from the community came up to see it, and to learn about the  microwave oven.  After I had been here for a couple of years working with the adult  program, the home economist at Public Service, and I was really  disappointed that I didn   t get that job, but what I didn   t know is they  were starting to phase that job out. The person that got the job that I  didn   t get was not there for very long. She went on to do other things.  But the next person that took that job had applied for a 4-H agent   s job  in our county, and I became acquainted with her. She   s a highly  intelligent young lady and she was very capable of doing a lot of things.  She was hired in Public Service and microwaves were more in the stores  then. They were not  2,000 anymore, although they were probably  500  or  600, some of them. Part of her job was to work with the merchants,  the appliance people, and maybe not to show off their wares, but to be  aware of what they had available. The merchants were very eager to  cooperate if she needed to use an appliance for some reason, and they  had a nice kitchen down at the Public Service office that was relatively  new.  She and I got together. She wanted to do a microwave cooking class, and  we advertised a microwave cooking class on Saturday. We planned the  16  Finchum  Wood  Finchum  Wood  Finchum  Wood  lessons, we got our recipes together, we advertised it, and we were  overflowing. We had probably twelve microwaves. Any merchant that  was selling a microwave at that time, she made arrangements for them to  provide the microwave for us to use in the class, and we cooked  everything from grape jelly to a turkey in a microwave. We did some  demonstrations in the morning, and the turkey was one of them that we  demonstrated in the morning. What we   d demonstrate in the morning  was lunch. After our demonstration we divided the class up into groups  of three or four, depending on what size group we needed, and gave  them a recipe. They cooked that recipe in the microwave, and it was  exciting and it was fun, and people really enjoyed it. We got a good  report. We did that a couple of years, and then she went on to other  things. I think her husband worked for Phillips, and they were probably  transferred or something. Anyway, she wasn   t working at Public  Service. I continued this class with a couple of other Public Service  home economists for two or three years until they phased that job  completely out.  Would you have to practice it some at home to make sure it turned out  right before you did it for the group?  Some of them we did, and I had a microwave at home, and Suzanne had  one. We both had microwaves available to us. I had one at home by this  time. My son was playing little league baseball in the summer, he and  my daughter both were, and they were in gymnastics. They were getting  tired of eating at McDonald   s, and one night my son said,    Mom, do we  have to eat McDonald   s again tonight?    So the next day I went out and  bought a microwave. So, I had a microwave oven, and I practiced that  turkey at home. You were cooking it with the breast side down for so  many minutes. You were flipping it to the side, wing-side up for so  many minutes, to the other side wing-side up for so many minutes, and  then breast-side up for so many minutes, and then using a thermometer  to see if it was the right temperature. So yeah, we practiced it.  Did it taste as good as a baked one?  Yes it did, and it browned. But it was time consuming. I mean, it   s  longer than anything else. We did fish dishes, and all kinds of dishes,  vegetables and desserts. I still use some of those recipes and people tell  me they still use some of those recipes today.  Popcorn.  Popcorn. Well, we wanted people to learn how to use the microwave for  something besides heating coffee. It was too expensive to be a coffee  warmer or a popcorn popper.  17  Finchum  Wood  Finchum  Wood  Finchum  Wood  Finchum  Wood  Slow cookers?  I didn   t do classes for slow cookers. I did some lessons with slow  cooking. Later on, I did some training for child-care workers. Home-based  businesses were starting to come in later on, and that became part  of my responsibility. I organized a home-based business group here, and  I worked with people out of Tri-County Tech, at the business center out  there. We offered a multi-county workshop with special speakers that we  brought in at one time. It was quite a varied list of things that we were  able to do.  When I came to work here, we had an Ag 4-H agent and a home  economics 4-H agent, and an Ag agent who was the county director at  the time and the adult home economist. The 4-H Ag agent told me,     Well Carol,    (and he was such a help to me)    You know, they put you  out here, and you   re doing all these educational things, but it   s also PR  for OSU. They kind of put you out here and give you a tomcat license to  do whatever you want to do, as long as the university   s in the forefront,  and the programs are in the forefront.     I was a USDA employee, because at that time we were getting funds  from USDA   and still do. I had a USDA appointment   everybody did  at that time. It was later on that they stopped the USDA appointments.  When I retired, I think I was one of maybe ten employees with  Extension that was on a USDA appointment. I was under civil-service  retirement and teacher   s retirement, instead of FIRS retirement that most  of them are on now.  And when you first started, did you have benefits?  I had sick leave. I had vacation. Yes.  And insurance?  I had insurance, and I still have the life insurance that I took out at that  time. I still have Blue Cross and Blue Shield insurance, and when I  retired, I was able to keep my policy with Medicare. It became  secondary and Medicare became first. I think I had twenty-two days of  annual leave and twenty-two days of sick leave.  Pretty good.  That was pretty good. My children were three and five when I came to  work for Extension, and so they kind of grew up in that office, too. But I  had enough sick leave, and I was healthy and did not abuse it, and I had  enough vacation time that I kind of hoarded. My husband was a  18  Finchum  Wood  newspaper man, and he thought he had to be around for every fire and  wreck, you know. At that time he was a reporter, and he was chasing fire  trucks and ambulances and those kinds of things, whatever to get the  story. He later was promoted up to managing editor. I saved my vacation  time and I had more than he did, too. Because I was the only one doing  the job, you know, I made my plan and I worked my plan. But if my  children were sick, I could take a day of vacation and stay home with  them. It was the best job I could   ve ever had and raised a family. I just  thought it was, to me, it was the perfect job.  Even if it was longer hours?  Oh, of course, yes. It was longer hours. The first six months that I  worked with 4-H I spent more time with the male 4-H agent than I spent  with my husband and my family, but I was learning. My mother had  been in home demonstration work and I was familiar with it, but it had  been probably at least six years, maybe more than that since. Well, I   m  sure it was more than that, since I   d been to a 4-H club meeting. When I  was in 4-H the agents came to the school and conducted the meeting.  When I came to work here, we were starting a leader-led program. We  had leaders that conducted the 4-H meetings, and the agents went out to  assist them. We   d go out on a regular basis, but we weren   t the one  conducting the meeting. And so it was a little bit different.  Copan didn   t have a leader at that time. They were still meeting at the  schools, and we   d go to that meeting. Ochelata was still meeting in the  schools, and we   d go to that meeting. Oglesby was meeting in the  schools, and we loved to go to Oglesby. They usually met in the  afternoon, and they always wanted us to come for lunch. They always  had really good lunch stuff at the lunchroom, and the rest of the groups  met in the evening or after school. There was none in the Bartlesville or  the Dewey schools. They met at other places, and so that was different.  I had never really entered a fair. I had gone to the Muskogee fair as a  child, and as a teenager, but I never looked at the 4-H exhibits. I went to  the rides. The county fair was over when I went to work. I had been to  the county fair here, but I was not a part of it in any way. One of my first  jobs was picking up the 4-H exhibits at the Tulsa fair, and we had a lot  of 4-H exhibits. We had most, if not all, of the entomology exhibits, and  I learned more about some of those exhibits and some of those parts of  4-H that I didn   t have the opportunity  to earlier . I   d enrolled in insects  when I was a 4-Her, but I never had any material. And, you know, if  you   re going out in the county and you   re the agent, you can only be  there once a month, if that often, so that was never a project. The only  thing I   ve ever participated in, as I said, was dress review and  demonstrations. I remember I did a team demonstration one year,  19  Finchum  Wood  Finchum  Wood  Finchum  Wood  Finchum  Wood  making peanut butter cookies as a child, and our teacher let us out of  school to practice for this, to go to the county seat and do the  demonstrations. We made so many peanut butter cookies.  Well if you had to pick up things, you had to have a car with a good  trunk?  Yes, I had a big trunk, and I had not driven in Tulsa much at all until I  came to work here. I didn   t know my way around in Tulsa. I had gone  through there before I came to work here, but I had about a one-year-old  and a three-year-old or four-year-old in the car with me. As I   d go  through Tulsa, I   d hand them a box of cereal and I   d say,    Eat this and  don   t talk to Mommy until we get past the bridge,    (which is the  Arkansas River bridge down there)    Unless it   s an emergency.    And so,  I just wasn   t used to it, but I got used to it and I loved it. I didn   t mind  the travel.  I was fortunate I was involved in the state association for extension  home economists, served on a number of committees, chaired a number  of committees, served as secretary of the association. Went to my first  national meeting, and I don   t even remember the year. I think it was  1976, a bicentennial year, because we were dressing in bicentennial  costumes for one of the dinners that year. I left my children with my  parents in Keota, and went to Knoxville. That was my first experience at  a national meeting, in a large hotel, fancy hotel, as far as I was  concerned.  Must   ve been the Hyatt Regency then.  It was. It was the Hyatt Regency. It was a strange looking building. It  had the elevator on the outside, and we did not stay there. We stayed at  the Holiday Inn, and that was a couple of blocks away. I still don   t like  glass elevators, but it was different. And for this trip, I think the group of  agents that went chartered a bus and we all went together on a bus. That  was a good way to get better acquainted with some of them.  Seems like 1976 was the year Cleo Bryan came out with her Seems Like  I Done it This-a-way cookbook.  Yes, yes.  Do you have anything you want to say about her?  Oh, I just love Cleo. She was just such a kind person, and such a  knowledgeable person, and a funny person. She just made you feel like  you were a part of whatever you were at with her.  20  Finchum  Wood  Finchum  Wood  Finchum  Wood  Finchum  Wood  Finchum  Wood  I heard she was    colorful.     She was very colorful. She was very colorful.  When you were at OSU, was Dean O   Toole there?  Yes, Dean O   Toole was there. In fact, when I was looking for my  diplomas, I found a letter signed by Dean O   Toole that told me I made  the Dean   s Honor Roll the last semester I was there.  Sounds like the two of them are complete opposites as far as how they  approached things, I guess.  Oh, yes. One of my major advisors when I was at OSU, when I went out  to do my student teaching, I think her name was Ms. Cunningham. I was  going to look that up too, but I didn   t get that done. She evaluated us.  She was a very practical person, and she evaluated my partner and I  different than some of the others did. She handed us a spiral notebook  when we went out to do student teaching, and she said,    This is your  bible. You write in it every day what your experience is. Whatever you  want to write in it, you put it in.    Then on certain occasions she   d come  out to check on us. And when we   d be back on campus, she   d check our  bible, and we   d talk about whatever we wrote in it. She was a darling  person. I believe she went from OSU to Oregon, but I   m not sure.  I haven   t heard her name.  I   ll have to look her name up. I meant to look it up.  Was it very easy for you to have gotten promoted if you wanted to within  the county?  I think so. I think so. I told you I served at every desk, officially. I came  in as 4-H home economist, and then I was promoted. It was considered  promotion at that time to go to adult home economist. The only other  place to go would   ve been to county director, and I applied for that  position a couple of times. The first time I didn   t get the job. I was not  surprised, and it didn   t upset me. The second time I applied for that  position I thought I wanted it more. As it turned out, I was not the one  that was selected, and it was probably one of the best things that ever  happened to me because I went on to do other things. As I was working  with the home-based businesses, I had the opportunity to become a  partner in a group travel business. I spent my weekends and vacation  doing that. Of course, I didn   t use office time. I would not have done  that if I had gotten the job as county extension director. I wouldn   t have  had time.  21  Finchum  Wood  Finchum  Wood  Finchum  Wood  Finchum  And it would be less people contact.  And it would be less people contact, yes. Well, I would   ve still been  doing the same thing, and as interim county director, I had the  opportunity to work with some budgeting. The last time I applied for the  job of county director Randy Pirtle, who   s the director now, also applied  for it and he was the one that was selected. I supported him all the way. I  never had a problem with it. I was disappointed, of course, but the more  I thought about it, the more I thought,    This is not what God has for me  at this point. I   m here because God placed me in this position to be here,  and that   s not what I   m to do now.    I was enjoying what I was doing,  without taking on anything.  I don   t know that I   ve ever told Randy this, but the nicest thing about  him getting the job and me not getting it was my husband had also been  a police officer in Bartlesville. One of the dispatchers was a former 4-  Her of mine, and if something happened at the extension office, they   d  call me before they   d call anybody else. Because she knew me, not  because I had that responsibility, but because she knew I   d know who to  call. She called me one night about two-thirty in the morning, woke me  up and said,    Carol, there   s a window open up at your office. You need  to come up and check that.    And I said,    Well, I tell you what. The  person you need to call, and the person in charge, is Randy Pirtle. You  need to call him, and he   ll be glad to come down and take care of it.    So  that   s what I did, and I don   t think I ever told Randy that. I didn   t do it to  be mean or hateful or anything like that. I felt,    It   s time for me to turn  loose.    You know, you have to let your kids grow up and go their own  way. Just because I did this for a few months in between here, I don   t  own it.  I did do a lot of work with rural development. At the time, I hadn   t  finished my masters. When Randy came he was starting to work on his  master   s, and so they allowed me to come  to OSU . I enjoyed the rural  development work too, so they allowed me to go ahead and continue to  do that in working with the chamber of commerce. Then at some point  in time I did something else.  Was the master   s from OSU?  My master   s was from OSU  In Home Economics?  In Home Economics, Education, and Community Service.  And what year?  22  Wood  Finchum  Wood  Finchum  Wood  Finchum  Wood  Finchum  Wood  Finchum  Wood  That was 1988. I took my first graduate class the summer after I  graduated from OSU, after I   d worked a year at Perkins. It was a Red  Cross home nursing class and I was certified to teach Red Cross home  nursing to adults. At that time the vocational teachers taught an adult  class sometime during the school year, and so I took that. That was my  first graduate class and it was about twenty years later, or so, that I  finally finished up my master   s degree.  Did you get to do that on work time?  I did. OSU was asking us to get a master   s. They weren   t telling us we  were going to be fired if we didn   t, but they were highly encouraging it.  I made application for educational leave and took the classes. Sometimes  I could get a class in Tulsa. OSU-Tulsa wasn   t there then, but there   d be  classes that would be taught there. Sometimes there   d be Saturday  classes, and there   d be maybe Friday and Saturday classes sometimes.  I   d get up and I   d leave my house at four o   clock in the morning. Put a  glass of milk in the cup holder in my car and a cup of dry cereal in the  other side, and I   d have my breakfast on the way. I   d be on campus in  time to hunt for a parking place at seven-thirty and get to my class by  eight o   clock.  That dedication to finish.  And my family was very supportive. When it got time to write the thesis,  I did do some of that at the office, on office time.  What was your topic?  My topic was the referral behavior of family serving organizations in  Tulsa and Washington County. I surveyed offices, and I probably have a  copy of my thesis in this library because I gave them one. I don   t  remember if I sent one to Tulsa or not, but it   s at OSU because my son  told me he looked it up one day when he was in school there.  Well, looking over your thirty years, do you have a high point or two?  Oh, it   s all high.  No low points?  Oh, I   m sure I had some low points, too. The hardest thing for me to do  as an employee was when it came time to (it was not a problem doing  the monthly reports and filling in the numbers) write a year-end report  and have to go back and evaluate things that had gone on six, nine,  twelve months ago. My personality is that once something   s done, you  23  Finchum  Wood  Finchum  Wood  know, I don   t relive it. Except I   ve relived it today, with you, and as I  look through these questions, I   ve relived a lot of this. Going back and  writing what I needed to write  was hard , because once it   s done, there  was other things to go on to. You usually had a dozen things going at  one time. You know, you   d plan your day, and I   d have on my calendar  what I was scheduled to do that day, and I knew what I was going to do.  In many cases, I knew what I was going to do five years from now, that I  was going to do something. I mean, I   d had it penciled in. And that was  hard for me to go back and be sure that I got everything that I needed.  Calendars were your friend.  Calendars were my friend, and I still have all of my calendars,  someplace out in my barn at home, in a box.  Do you still help with county fairs?  I did, but I did not help last year. I joined an extension group after a  while. I had the best people to work with, both staff and volunteers, that  anybody could ever have. I just could not ever say enough good things  about them, about my coworkers, and I had some of the most creative  people to work with. Much more creative than I was, both as volunteers  and as coworkers. I   m sure there were some sad times. Like when I   d go  to a funeral for one of my members that I   d gotten close to or had been a  long-term member. I stopped working at the fair last year.  The year that I retired, 2001, I had really always counted the years that I  had until retirement by the number of fairs that I had left. In all honesty,  that was not my favorite time. I loved the people. I loved watching them  enter and participate, but there was so many things that you could not  plan for that could go wrong. My philosophy always was that if you  can   t plan for it, something   s really going to go wrong. There might be  somebody that would be upset about a judge, or there might be  something little, you know, that would seem like a little thing to most  people, but to the people involved it was not a little thing. So I didn   t  miss that at all.  The last fair that I worked at officially, I   d gone over to set up some  things on Friday and I came back to do some more on Saturday morning.  I came in to the exhibit hall. A water fountain was leaking, and the  exhibit hall was starting to flood. Not the whole floor, but we had all the  tablecloths and all the drapes around the table. I didn   t know how to stop  the water fountain from leaking, so I put up all the table skirts on top so  they would be okay, went back to the Extension office, called the fair  manager, and said,    We   ve got a problem. I don   t know how to get this  stopped. You need to come up here.    I was going to be the only one  24  there that day.  Got a hold of her, she came up and got somebody to fix the leak in the  water fountain. I   d already started mopping the floor and trying to keep  it as thin as it could be. We got all finished and we were visiting, and I  said,    Janet, I want to tell you something. I have decided, I have not  announced this to too many people, but I have decided,    (this was  probably in August or September)    That next January I   m probably  going to retire.    She was actually the assistant manager. The manager  had had health problems and had had to resign. I think by this time they  probably made Janet the manager. She looked up at me and she put her  hands on her hips like this and said,    You   re all leaving me. Carol   s  gone.    Carol Smith was her friend; that was the manager   s name.    She   s  not here. Now you   re leaving. What am I going to do?    I said,    Well,  Janet, I   ll tell you what. I   ll come back and do whatever you want me to  do, as long as you want me to do it, or until there   s a new person in my  position over there that can do this.    And that was okay. So I did that, I  came back and just worked in the office as an office assistant. Answered  the telephones and told people where to go.  Janet was a very good friend of mine, and we got along really well. We  were both outspoken. We might sound like we were fighting at one  point, but we both understood each other and when it was done, it was  done. You know, nothing lingered. I felt like that I could say whatever I  wanted to her, and she would to me, too. So, I came back to help her  with that, and I did for, let   s see, that was 2001. I did that for a number  of years. Then she became very ill and died of colon cancer, and her  daughter had been named the assistant. Of course, I   d watched Kelly  grow up like one of my own kids, almost. And I told Kelly, I said,     Now, Kelly, I told your mom I   d be here as long as she wanted me to.  If you want me to stay, I   ll stay.    And she said,    Yes, I want you to.     This was her first year as manager. And so that first year that we didn   t  have Janet was kind of a low point in the fair for me, but we made it  through. Then when Kelly retired to take a teaching position, I said,     Well, I told you I   d be here as long as you wanted me to, but you   re  leaving, so there   s no need for me to stay anymore.    And I decided it  was time for me to move on.  About four months after I retired, my husband was diagnosed with  esophageal cancer. I started noticing some change in him in January,  after I   d retired. We   d go to OSU to a basketball game and stop at  Mexico Joes and he   d only eat one tamale instead of two, and he was  eating one half of a sandwich instead of a whole one. I was so glad that I  had gone ahead and retired. Ronnie George, my district director, had  asked me if it was okay with me if he advertised the position early  instead of waiting until I was officially gone, and I said,    Sure, go  25  Finchum  Wood  Finchum  Wood  ahead.    He said,    You know, you can still change your mind until  December 31. After that, you can   t change your mind.    And I said,    I  know it. I   m not going to change my mind unless something should  happen to my husband that I would feel like I   d need this job, not  necessarily for the money, but for sanity.    In about March or April he  was diagnosed with esophageal cancer, and I was really glad that I had  gone ahead and retired. He became my job. I was still going ninety miles  an hour there for a number of years. He   s now a nine year survivor, from  a disease that only three percent survive, something like that.  That   s terrific. Did either one of your children go into this type of work?  Yes and no. Both of our kids graduated from OSU. Our daughter went to  NEO  Northeastern Oklahoma University  first. She majored in home  economics. She majored in nutrition. She   s a licensed, registered  dietitian. She did her internship at Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas, and  she worked for ten years at Hillcrest as a dietitian after. Then her  husband was transferred to Guymon, and she became a full-time  homemaker, and eventually a mother of two children. She still keeps her  credentials up.  Our son was in the National Guard. He started out at school here at  Bartlesville Wesleyan, got married, moved to Stillwater. His wife was in  school there. He enrolled in Stillwater. He took some classes in Edmond  and came back to Stillwater. He graduated from OSU in business, and he  finished his time in the Air Force. He went to Officer   s Candidate  School and served as, I can   t remember the title of his job at the Air  National Guard base in Tulsa, but it was over the money management,  accounting. Then he went to D.C. and worked out of the Pentagon for a  year, when they were working on some kind of a new computer program  for all branches of the services. Came back to Oklahoma when that was  over, retired. He had graduated, of course, before he did all those things.  He got a job as a pharmaceutical representative with Astra Zeneca  Pharmaceuticals. His drugs were esophageal drugs, gastro-intestinal  drugs and cardiac drugs. So when his dad was sick, he was able to go  with us to all the appointments. He knew the right questions to ask, and  you know, if you don   t know the right questions, you   re not going to get  the right answers. And that   s what he   s still doing today.  That   s still serving     It   s still a service kind of organization. Our daughter told her husband,    I  don   t care what you do, just take care of our money so I never have to go  back to work again.    But she   s keeping her credentials up. She   s home  schooling two children. They   re now twelve and ten, and almost thirteen  and eleven, I guess.  26  Finchum  Wood  Finchum  Wood  Finchum  Wood  Finchum  Wood  Finchum  Wood  Finchum  Wood  Are they involved in 4-H?  No, they   re not involved in 4-H. I tried to get them involved in 4-H, and  Charlotte   s tried to get them involved in 4-H. They are involved in  sports, and they   re involved in their church, and they are so busy with  their home schooling. She   s doing an excellent job. I   ve just been real  proud of her. I don   t know that I could   ve, but that   s her job. So that   s  kind of where they are there.  Does she remember being told not to ask questions until you get across  the river?  I don   t think she does, because she was still in diapers. Tim does. I   m  sure Tim does. She was probably eating Cheerios by then, so she was  less than two years old. I doubt that she remembers that.  So as a member of a homemaker   s club, do you exhibit at the fair?  I have, but I haven   t in the last couple of years.  Sewing or canning?  Both. We have a canning exhibit, and one year I canned peaches for the  group and one year I made jelly. One year I made corn relish and  peaches again. I re-did my kitchen, finished it up last year, and I put a  smooth top range in. I don   t really like using my pressure cooker on that  smooth top range, so I told them I wouldn   t be canning anymore. And I  made some things for the kids. One year our granddaughter, they were  reading the Little House on the Prairie books, and she wanted a Little  House on the Prairie dress. So I made her a dress and a bonnet, and I  entered that one year in the fair. I don   t remember what it placed. I don   t  think it got a blue ribbon.  But it placed something?  It placed red, I think. And she still wears it around today. They go over  to the schoolhouse at Pleasant Valley, last year and this year, and she  wore that Little House on the Prairie costume to the school.  You   ve been involved with the fair so much, the smells and the scents  and all that just     Well, when I came to work here, the extension homemakers were  cooking meals every day, noon and dinner, at the fair kitchen. Back in  those days they cooked everything from scratch. They made pies, they   d  make homemade noodles. They   d make them, the noodles, a couple of  27  Finchum  Wood  weeks before the fair and we   d have all the tables in one of the exhibit  rooms full of noodles drying there for a couple of days, and they fried  chicken. They   d clean the chickens out in the backyard in a tub full of  ice water. Everything was made right there, and that was their money  making activity.  They still cook one day of the fair, and I didn   t do too much to help them  in the kitchen. I   d go over and support them, but OSU was always telling  me that I wasn   t supposed to be involved in the fundraising, in raising  money for the organizations, and so I   d just give them my support  however. If they got into a bind, I   d go over and get drinks, and fill the  cups with ice or something as the people were moving through the line. I  didn   t figure that was too much involved in moneymaking, and just to  kind of help them, you know. Just to support them any way that I could,  except I wasn   t in there cooking. I might be in there washing dishes  some days, but     Do they cook those same things?  No, no, they don   t. They buy cobblers now. They just cook one day, and  they stopped cooking fried chicken before they gave up the kitchen  completely. They sold all of their equipment. I mean, they had all  commercial  things . That was their kitchen, and so now one of the  ladies usually makes the noodles for them, but she makes them at her  house now. She makes them a batch at a time, and when we   re talking a  batch, this is like a big commercial mixer. She has one at home and  she   ll make them and then dry them and bag them and leave them in her  deep freeze until time to bring them up. They do chicken and noodles,  they do meatloaf. Sometimes they do a broccoli, rice and cheese  casserole. They still do the coleslaw that they always did.  I was going to bring you one of their recipe books, and I forgot that. I   ll  have to mail that to you or something. What I have is a copy of one that  they printed of their fair recipes. They don   t make the pies anymore.  They   d come up and make pie crusts and make cream pies and fruit pies.  Like I said, they buy the cobblers now. And they still cook ham and  beans and cornbread. And they still make homemade rolls. They do this  for two meals now. But at one point in time, they were looking for  another moneymaking activity, and the president at the time got the idea  that maybe they could make their pie shells and sell them. They still do  that, and the week before Thanksgiving, or sometime within two weeks  before Thanksgiving, they set aside a week, and they go to the fair  building. For four days they make pie shells. They   re pre-sold. They  take orders for the pie shells, and they sell them in batches of five. And  you can either buy five pie shells in a foil pan, or five dough balls for a  certain price. We sell about four thousand shells every year, three to four  28  Finchum  Wood  Finchum  Wood  Finchum  thousand shells. I   d always go over and check on them and see if they  needed anything when they were making the pie shells, and I   d crimp a  little bit. A lot of the times when they   d be making it, I   d have other  things I   d be obligated to do, so I didn   t spend all day over there with  them making pie shells.  But after I retired, I said,    I   ll come back and help you make pie shells  now,    so I did, even when Jim was finishing up his treatments or in his  treatments. I   d take some time off and go up there and maybe spend an  afternoon and visit with them and crimp some pie shells. I didn   t go up  and do it last year because I was having some problems with fluid  retention and my legs were swelling, and on that cement floor, and some  other reason, something else was going on that I couldn   t go up there  much last year. But after that first year I was retired and he was all  better, I   d go up about every day and crimp pie shells with them, and  finally I decided to join a group.  Every group in the county, of course, asked me to join their group and I  said,    You know, that   d be like picking your favorite child and I can   t do  that.    So I waited and I waited and then I finally decided. One of the  members who was a past president said,    Join our group. You can do  like I do. I work and I don   t even show up half the time,    because she  works at night, and she goes when she can. She said,    We won   t expect  you all the time.    So I looked at all the groups and I looked at the  meeting times, and I looked at what they were doing and the number of  members they had, because I didn   t want to have a highly visible  responsibility. I finally joined the group that I   m in now. They meet the  second Monday, in the morning. It   s the Show and Tell group, and I go  when I can. For a number of years, I was getting physical therapy and  muscle massage, and I didn   t go. That was the time I was doing that, and  that was more important than going to anything else. And so I go  occasionally.  Do any of the groups do cookbooks?  Our group did a cookbook, and at different times, different groups have  put together recipes, not always a cookbook, it might be a recipe folder,  but not every group did.  Just as a money raiser, too?  Sometimes, not necessarily. Now, when our group did it, we did it as a  moneymaking thing, and sold them at the bazaar at the fair, but most of  the groups it was just to share with their members their recipes.  Been a good thirty years, hasn   t it?  29  Wood  Finchum  Wood  Finchum  Wood  Finchum  Wood  Finchum  Wood  Finchum  Wood  It   s been a wonderful thirty years. It really has. It took me about two  weeks, or more than that, before I got through writing thank you notes  for my retirement party. Every group brought me a gift. They didn   t ask  me if I wanted gifts. If they   d asked me, I would   ve probably said no, do  something else. But they didn   t ask me, so I just took them and enjoy  them. But as I wrote thank you notes to everyone, it turned out to be a  letter to every club. I could only write three, and then I was crying.  That   s because it   s been a good thirty years.  Yes.  And it becomes a very large part of your life.  It was, but it was a good time.  And to think that you decided on that when you were in the fourth grade.  In the fourth grade. Yes. I either wanted to be a 4-H agent or a home  demonstration agent, or a singer.  You got to do a little bit of both.  And I got to do a little bit of both, but the singing never paid the bills.  One of the classes that I taught, I taught sewing classes at one of the  fabric stores. I took a stretch and sew class, and I probably fitted 200 or  300 or 400 women in Washington County with stretch and sew pants so  they could make pants to fit them, and they   d be happy with them the  first time they made them.  Not too many people can claim that.  No. Maybe they wouldn   t want to. And I did some in-services for  Phillips Petroleum Company. I taught some classes here at the library. I  joined an association, a group called American Business Women   s  Association, and I was a member of that. I was named Woman of the  Year one year, but the reason I was was because cable television was  just coming to Bartlesville. We had a cable TV station here. The  newspaper was a part of it. I had the opportunity to present the first local  program on cable TV. I called it Potpourri so I could include anything.  Sometimes I might have a specialist from Stillwater that would be in,  and we   d tape them, the TV show, and that person would be the person  really doing the show. I would just introduce them. I   d have members of  the group come in, I had a member that was a floral designer and she  came in and did some floral designs one time. I did a lot of cooking  classes. I did a program one time on food that kids could make  30  Finchum  Wood  themselves.  My daughter was babysitting a little boy that was about five years old,  and his mother agreed that he could come on the show and help me. He  made ants on a log and he made snacks for himself, and then the cable  people gave us a copy of that that I could give to him, and I have a copy.  I did one on testing pressure canners and testing the gauge of the  pressure canner, and using the canner to can foods. I did this for about  two or three years. And during that time I had to have some surgery, and  personnel changed. We started taping the program at the kitchen at  Public Service. The guys that were running the camera and doing the  taping of the show were also a part of the news. The cable was in with  the newspaper, at that time. And one of their advertising reps got a  grocery store to sponsor it, so it didn   t cost Cooperative Extension  anything. And their sponsorship was that I could go down to their  grocery store and I could buy fifty dollars worth of whatever I needed to  use in the show, and then they got some credit on the show. It was  always OSU Cooperative Extension program. There were partners that I  had that I had never dreamed of having, didn   t ever dream of that  opportunity.  But we ended, one of the cameramen moved to Kansas City and went to  work there, and the photographer. They loved doing the show because  they could eat whatever was left over. We moved from the Public  Service building to the main office of the Examiner Enterprise, and I  was carrying boxes up two flights of stairs. I would go home and do the  prep work at home with stuff from my kitchen, and then take it down the  next day and tape the show. Then I   d have to spend another half a day  cleaning it up. So I was out of the office a full day and a half, usually,  when I did this. It was a good experience, but I had to take some time off  to recoup from some surgery of some kind, I don   t remember what now,  and then we gradually just dropped it, phased it out. That was a different  experience that not everybody had the opportunity to do.  Since Randy has been here as County Extension Director, he had a TV  show. Mine had been over a while since then and I was on to different  things. He had an excellent show where they   d come out, and he had  different sites, and film him talking about trees or crops or gardening or  whatever. He had a very good show.  Just whatever way you could get the news and information out.  Just however way you could get the word out. I felt like it was my job to  help the people that I work with to improve their life or better  themselves or make better decisions any way that we could get the  information to them, like the 4-H motto,    To Make the Best Better.    I  31  Finchum  Wood  Finchum  Wood  Finchum  Wood  worked with the best people that I had, but my goal was for them to use  their knowledge, their skills, their resources, the way that would make  them the happiest, I guess you could say.  I think the county was lucky to have you for those few years.  Well, I was lucky to have them. I had really good secretaries, I had  really good coworkers. I wouldn   t change a thing.  That   s a good note to end on, isn   t it?  It is, it is, and my goodness.  Thank you for your sharing it. It   s been great.  Thank you.  -------  -------
