Story_ID: 14583
Speaker 1: Would you like to explain for our viewers the meaning of the term 'Mother', since I'm gonna use it throughout the interview, that it has to do with the Catholic church or any other kind of--?
Speaker 2: I acquired this name when I was in the Recreation Department of the Cleveland Job Corps [Center, Cleveland, Ohio].  And I think I was the oldest member of our department, and we had young ladies at that time coming from five different states.  And when they would address me, they would say, "You remind me of my mother.  You talk like my mother at home."  And so I--the name was dubbed, 'Mother', and from then on, it was 'Mother Thompson' or 'Mother' or 'Ma', or whatever.  And I felt that way toward the young ladies.  They became close to me.  Now, we had three hundred and fifty young ladies living in the building and about two hundred and fifty coming to the center every day to study different vocations.
Speaker 1: Okay, so it's an honorary title?
Speaker 2: Honorary title.
Speaker 1: Although, as we get into the interview, we'll also talk about the children that you're actually the biological mom, mother to.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 14584
Speaker 1: Now, the next set of questions, we call these 'People' magazine-ish type questions, and they may sound a little silly, but they're serious questions and I'd like for you to answer them if you don't mind.  Could you please tell me what your favorite food is?
Speaker 2: My favorite food?  Foods.  I love greens.  I love candied yams.  I love fruit and I love meat.
Speaker 1: Okay, and your favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Fall and winter.
Speaker 1: Okay, do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Green.
Speaker 1: All right, and how about a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: I can't say right now.  I have lived abroad and I have visited countries abroad.  I don't have a favorite spot just now.
Speaker 1: All right, well do you have a favorite phrase or a saying?
Speaker 2: My favorite phrase that I love to say is, "If it's the Lord's will."  That's found in the book of James [James 4:15].
Story_ID: 14585
Speaker 1: Now, in the next section we'd like to find out a little bit about your family background.  So I wanted to ask if you could please start by telling me about your mother, what was her name and where was she born, and where did she grow up?
Speaker 2: I'll have to pause there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (Tape is interrupted)
Speaker 1: ...flesh mother's side.  But the one who wrote those songs, she's the one who raised me.  So now, we need to--where are you gonna come from?
Speaker 2: So, well, if you want to say your adopted or you're raised by a foster mother.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) All right, I don't' mind saying that.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I, I hate the word foster, but I was adopted.
Speaker 2: Okay, so if you want to say that for the record.  Now, then the next set of questions, I would ask about your father.  Is it okay if--?
Speaker 1: I have no, I have no knowledge so you don't need to put that in.
Speaker 2: Okay, well, all right.  Well, do you want that, that she raised you?
Speaker 1: I was raised by my adopted mother  [Henrietta Coleman].
Speaker 2: Right, adopted mother, okay.  And, and you don't want to talk about the father?  Or it's just, not part of the picture?
Speaker 1: Uh-uh.
Speaker 2: Okay, so do you want to say that so it won't seem like I'm leaving that out or do you think it's not (simultaneously) (unclear)?
Speaker 1: My, my flesh mother,  I knew her.  But when we were, when I was about four, we were taken from her, my sister and I, because of her illness.  She had Parkinson's disease.  And I lived with this aunt [Viola Tate] that you see on the picture until I was about thirteen.  And then I was adopted into the home of Miss--of the Coleman's.
Story_ID: 14586
Speaker 1: I was named after my grandmother, Helen Turner, who was also a musician in Alabama.  My real, my flesh mother's name is Sarah Crawford.  My sister [Frances Crawford] and I lived with her until we were about four and two and a half.  She became ill with Parkinson's disease.  So the family split, and my great-aunt Viola took me and the other great-aunt, Mary Crowder, took my sister.  And I lived with my great-aunt until I was about thirteen.  And at that time, I was given to Miss Henrietta Coleman who adopted me.
Speaker 2: Okay, and so you were about thirteen.  That was approximately 1944?  When you started to live with--.
Speaker 1: Around, around in that time '44 [1944] or '45 [1945].
Speaker 2: Okay, and what can you tell me about Miss [Henrietta] Coleman?  What kind of person was she?
Speaker 1: She was a grand lady.  I have to say that.  She's home with the Lord now.  But when I went to live with her, my mother had a nervous breakdown.  She could not walk.  She could sit up on the bed.  I became her legs, hands, feet and everything.  When I moved there, there were four of us in that family, my grandmother, Martha Coleman, my mother's sister, Willie Scott Coleman, my mother, Henrietta Coleman, myself, and we had this very large music, gospel church supply store, which was right downstairs in front of the house where we lived.  And at that time, most of the stores, there was a house attached to them and you could just walk right up the steps, as people did.  They'd come right through the back of the store where we had a room where my aunt made slipcovers, draperies, and--that was also the extra business.  And they could walk right upstairs and see my mother.  Everyone knew her, and when she got ill, people came to see her all day, every day.  It was just like open season, open house.
Speaker 2: So your mother [Henrietta Coleman] was also a musician?
Speaker 1: She, she, she was a musician and since she loved music, she sang in the gospel choir at Second Mount Sinai Baptist Church [Cleveland, Ohio].  She was not a soloist.  She was a songwriter, very gifted in writing poetry and most of her songs that are written, I set to music.  And they were sold.  They were published, and they were song by persons like the great Sallie Martin of Chicago, Illinois and other persons throughout the country.
Story_ID: 14587
Speaker 1: Now the store that you mentioned, the gospel music supply store, was that a business that she launched?
Speaker 2: Yes, she [Henrietta Coleman] started this business--she and the late Roberta Martin started this business.  The first address I think was 7905 Central Avenue [Cleveland, Ohio], and it was called Coleman's and Martin's Studio Gospel Music [later Coleman's Studio of Gospel Music and Church Supply Store].
Speaker 1: Okay, do you know approximately when she opened the store?
Speaker 2: I think it was around 1940 because she was also a member of the [Thomas A.] Dorsey Gospel Choirs and Choruses [sic, National Convention of Gospel Choirs and Choruses, founded in 1932 by Dorsey].  So it was acceptable for the fact that a person, going into this type of business would be related to music in some form.  She was also supervisor of the youth at [Second] Mount Sinai [Baptist] Church [Cleveland, Ohio], and Reverend D. W. Hill encouraged her to work with the young people.  And having the store, we would rehearse in the store on Saturdays, and so she was really into music.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you're living and working--.
Speaker 2: Music.
Speaker 1: On location?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: At that store?
Speaker 2: Right.
Story_ID: 14588
Speaker 1: And what can you tell me about the street where the [Turner-Thompson's adoptive mother's] store [Coleman's Studio of Gospel Music and Church Supply Store] was located?  Central Avenue in Cleveland [Ohio]?
Speaker 2: At the time that I was there, Central was a rather busy street.  It was not a noisy street.  Right next door on the corner, mother [Henrietta Coleman] was one door from the corner of 79th Street.  If you wanted a business to flourish in those days, you would be near the crosstown [bus] line.  And see, at 79th there was the Central bus traveling east and west and there was the 79th Street bus traveling north and south.  So the people can get off the bus and come into the store and pick up music and watch for the next bus with a transfer to go home.  And by the, by the way, it was ten cent to ride the bus at that time, three cents with a transfer.  And the door was open in the spring and summer and people could hear the music.  There was a piano, and they would come in.  There was a barbershop around there, Chapman's Grocery Store was right on the corner, and a couple of other businesses that I sort of remember, and up, going up to 83rd Street, Evening Star Baptist Church [Cleveland, Ohio] was on the corner.  And at that time, Reverend [William] Sawyer's [Jr.] father was the pastor.
Speaker 1: And which Reverend [William] Sawyer [Sr.] is this then, the pastor?
Speaker 2: This is the father of, of the late Reverend Sawyer who, Junior.
Speaker 1: Bill Sawyer?
Speaker 2: Bill Sawyer, right.
Speaker 1: And what was his father's name?  Oh, he's a junior.  He's also Bill Sawyer, okay.
Speaker 2: Yes, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: And so it sounds then like this was a, really a lively community that you lived in?
Speaker 2: It was, it really was.
Speaker 1: Businesses and residential areas.
Speaker 2: We were like family to each other.
Speaker 1: Okay, are there any special sounds or smells that remind you of growing up on Central [Avenue] in the 1940s?
Speaker 2: The sound of the, the sound of the Bibbs Vegetable Market coming down the street.  He sold fresh vegetables and watermelon.  And I think a lot of persons may remember his daughter, Pauline [Bibbs].  She was a librarian, I think at Central [Library, Cleveland, Ohio], and I believe she's still living.  But her father would go through the neighborhood selling greens and cabbage and lovely tomatoes.  And then also at that time, there was a blind group that would come through the street on Saturday, five or six blind men, and they would stand at the corner, and they had a harmonica and a ukulele.  And so, and they would sing and people would give them money.  And then there was always a barbecue.  No area could exist without a barbecue.  So the smell of barbecue and people getting ready for Sunday.  You could smell the chicken cooking and the (laughs)--.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm wondering about the vegetable vender.  Is this on a cart or in--on a truck or how's he doing that?
Speaker 2: It was horse-drawn.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: And there was a scale, and you could go out, and he would stop, and you could go out, and you'd weigh the vegetables, what you want, and you paid him.  And he went through the area a long time, from 59th and Central all the way up to 79th, around that area because especially, Friday and Saturday, people were getting their hair cut and getting ready for Sunday.  And dinner was cooking and smelling all over the neighborhood, and he knew people would want those greens and salt pork and whatever.
Story_ID: 14589
Speaker 1: Now you said you come from a musical family.  Are there other children working in the store [Coleman's Studio of Gospel Music and Church Supply Store, Cleveland, Ohio], growing up in the household when you're there as a teenager?
Speaker 2: No, I was the only one.
Speaker 1: Okay, but you did say you had a sister.  And--
Speaker 2: I have, I have a sister who's still living right now outside of Dallas [Texas].  She said she had to forsake the cold weather and move south, and she has three children, two boys; one in Houston [Texas], and I think one is living outside of Memphis [Tennessee].  And her daughter lives outside of Dallas [Texas].  But they're all there.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what's her name?
Speaker 2: Her name is Frances Crawford.
Speaker 1: All right, and so she didn't live in the Coleman household with you?
Speaker 2: No, un-un, no.
Story_ID: 14590
Speaker 1: Can you tell me about your grandparents, Mrs. [Henrietta] Coleman's parents?  Do you have any information on them?
Speaker 2: My mother's mother was named Martha Coleman.  She lived to be eighty-three years old.  Her mother [Henrietta James] lived to be a hundred and three.  And she showed me the paper when she--that she had when she was nine years old and the slaves were freed.  And they were all from Alabama.  And she talked about how--her name was Mother James--Henrietta James.  And she had two sons that were twins.  They were what I think you'd call paternal twins because they looked nothing alike.  One was tall and thin, the other was short and stubby.  But mother--and then she had another sister that died early.  So Mother [Henrietta] James had four children.  And one son became very well known in Cleveland [Ohio].  He had a barbecue business, Bama's Barbeque.  And most people would come to 86th and Cedar [Avenue] and get their barbeque.  He first started on 49th and  Central, and that's when the segregation of Cleveland--the cabs were segregated.  The Red and White cabs was at 49th.  The Zone Cab [Company] could go out, but bring no one in, and then you could--you know, of course, there's the Yellow Cab that's always been.
Story_ID: 14591
Speaker 1: So, you've mentioned two major thoroughfares, Cedar Avenue and Central Avenue.  Are--is that Main Street for black America in Cleveland [Ohio]?
Speaker 2: It, it was the, the main thoroughfare in that area.  And then mother [Henrietta Coleman] eventually moved to Cedar Avenue. Her business then was 8517 Cedar, right at the corner.  And we had a large community business--across the street was Dr. Burns, pediatrician.  To the left of us across the street was Boyd's Furniture [Inc.] store, and my mother's uncle's barbecue business [Bama's Barbeque] was right up the street.  And then there was a very nice nightclub, but you didn't know it was a nightclub because there was no noise or anything.  And we knew, as children, we weren't allowed in there, and we didn't bother.  And further up the street, there was a pool hall and there was a grocery store across the street.  And a lot of Antioch [Baptist Church, Cleveland, Ohio] members that I know now grew up in this area from 79th to 89th, which included the [Elmer Franklin] Boyd's [and Son, Inc.] Funeral Home.
Speaker 1: There was a play at the Cleveland Play House not too many years ago, 'A Salute to Benny McIntyre'.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: But he referred to Cedar [Street] as the 'Boulevard of broken dreams'.
Speaker 2: It was called that.  It was called that.  We, we had two photographers on the street.  Everyone knew Mr. [Allen E.] Cole.  They would go to him.  And then there was the 'Twelve Counts' that had a nightclub and they were some real men of the day at that time.  They were near 83rd.  It was like a boulevard.
Speaker 1: So there were lots of entrepreneurs there, lots of, dreamers--,
Speaker 2: All on that street, yes--,
Speaker 1: --and musicians.
Speaker 2: --from 40th Street all the way up to a 105.  And then above, at 103rd Street, there was Playmore Skating Rink where we went skating.  And, and on Tuesday night was ladies' night and Friday night was everyone, and you didn't miss going to the Playmore.
Speaker 1: Okay, I, I asked about the, the sounds and smells that remind you of growing up, and you talked about the gospel music that's coming out of your family business.  And then, did you say the [Twelve] Counts, there's a group on Cedar [Street]?
Speaker 2: They were a club.
Speaker 1: Oh, a club?
Speaker 2: A social club.
Speaker 1: Is this a jazz club?
Speaker 2: No, the, the Twelve Counts was a group of twelve businessmen.  And I knew one of them very well, Fred Grier, he's deceased now.  He was one that sold Kirby vacuum cleaner, which I think a lot of people knew.  And he was also a member of Temple Baptist Church [Cleveland, Ohio].  And he told us that they used to just get together and sit somewhere and eat--I think like the roundtable does now.  And they decided one night they should be a club.  And they started sponsoring dances, and they would have different stars here, Dinah Washington and Gay Crosse, he had a little club at 83rd Street then.  He sort of was like a, a Louis Jordan.  Did you know of Louis Jordan?
Speaker 1: I've heard of the name before.
Speaker 2: That's before your time.
Speaker 1: But I've heard the name.
Speaker 2: But Gay Crosse was like Cleveland's Louis Jordan.  And they had a club around 83rd, I think between Cedar and Carnegie [Avenue], in that area.  And then they moved down further, but their club was very elite.  You know, you would dressed to go there.  In fact, the people that walked up and down Cedar were dressed very well.  We had no dress--dressed down people, as they call it now.
Story_ID: 14592
Speaker 1: I'm wondering since you're now a full-time musician, clinician, sacred music--,
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --is all that I've ever heard you perform, but hearing all those different sounds growing up, were you ever torn between the sacred and secular, or were you pretty much focused on what you wanted to do as a young person?
Speaker 2: When I was in my teens, and I was attending, I think Rawlings Junior High [Cleveland, Ohio], we had a band in the school.  And there were about six of us--little jazz band.  And the teacher liked us.  I think his name was Carter, yes.  And he would take us out to do little gigs.  We didn't call them gigs then, but that's what they say now.  We had a saxophonist, trombone, baritone sax, bass violin, drums, and I was on the piano.  And we would play at different places like Crile [General] Hospital [Cleveland, Ohio] and we'd go downtown, and I was rather enjoying it, thinking that I might be a second Hazel Scott.  But my mother [Henrietta Coleman] put an end to that 'cause she (laughs), she said, there will be no jazz growing up in (laughs), in that house.  But I, I enjoyed playing.  I could play the jazz as the person did it.  Two of my favorite numbers was 'After Hours' by Erskine Hawkins and 'Flying Home' by Lionel Hampton.  Now, I could play those two.  And I did like 'Begin the Beguine', and I can't think of the fellow who--oh, yes, I had a little repertoire of (laughs) of jazz.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, now, when is this then that your mother is helping you decide that you're only gonna be a gospel musician?  About how old were you then?
Speaker 2: I think I was, I was around, I was still in my teens.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: And it happened one night we went to Crile Hospital on the West Side, you know, to entertain the fellows [World War II veterans].  Some of them were bedridden and they had their legs, you know, you know, amputated or all of this.  And we thought we'd make them feel good, you know, by going out there.  So I told mother [Henrietta Coleman] the [Rawlings Junior High] Glee Club had to sing somewhere, and, and she said, "Okay."  This was not true.  But I had to use that to get out of the house (laughs).  And little did I know that my mother, being confined to the bed, she had a keen sense of discernment of the spirit, which is one of the fruits of the spirit.  Now, she could tell what I was up to even just by sitting on that bed.  And whether I was at home or not, someone would bring her the--"I saw Helen so and so."  "Did you know Helen was so and so?"  And, you know, so I really had to, to--you know, I had to come up in the straight narrow.  Well, mother was concerned about this Glee Club.  So she sent my grandmother [Martha Coleman] out in a car with someone and drove all the way out to York Road [Cleveland, Ohio].  And I was just whipping it on down on the piano.  I was getting down, or at least I thought was (laughs).  And I looked up in the door, and there stood my grandmother.  And I think I could have been bought for a dime (laughs).  I couldn't play, everything went out of me.  I had no more--I, I was just like a person was, they saw something, and they had come to a stop, and, you know, it startled them.  And then here I was.  I can't believe this.  This is my mother standing here, and all the fellows in casts, you know, and their toes just going, you know.  And mother said, "Aren't you shamed, playing that jazz, and those men are laying up there with half of their torso and everything off."  And I said, "But Mother, they want to be entertained."  "Well, you're not gonna entertain them anymore like that."  So that put an end to my jazz career.
Story_ID: 14593
Speaker 1: It sounds like that was an important lesson for you.  But I'm wondering about some of those other lessons you learned, maybe as a student in the Cleveland [Ohio] city schools?  Can you tell me what schools you attended?
Speaker 2: I, I went from Rawlings [Junior High School, Cleveland, Ohio] to Central High School [Cleveland, Ohio].  And at that time, when I was there, they had a beautiful a cappella choir which I loved.  And most students, they would have to be in the eleventh grade in order to sing in the a cappella choir, but I went in singing in the tenth grade because I was also a student at the Cleveland Settlement of Music [Cleveland Music School Settlement, Cleveland, Ohio] at that time.  And I also had a private tutor.  I was studying composition with, under Thomas Hill.  So I--all of this music was in me.  And I told Miss Walker at that time, I said, "Well, I can't wait 'til the eleventh grade.  I have to get in here now."  So she said, "You're an exception," 'cause she knew of me.  I was playing for a group that broadcast on the air.  I was also traveling at that time singing, and then being in the [Thomas A.] Dorsey Convention [National Convention of Gospel Choirs and Choruses], I was becoming well known in the city.  So when I walked in there and told her I wanted to be in the a cappella choir there was no problem.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, this Miss Walker, was she the music teacher?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: I became assistant director of the a cappella choir.
Speaker 1: While you were still a student?
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: All right, now, you've mentioned a couple of names.  And you just told me that Miss Walker was a music teacher but you also.
Speaker 2: Josephine Walker.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: Was she a special--(simultaneously)?
Speaker 2: She's still living.  She retired, she became an attorney.  She's retired from that.  And I think she's a nice grand old lady.  She's always lived on 89th Street near Quincy [Avenue].  And I'm not sure that she's there, but her family seems to have taken good care of her.
Speaker 1: Okay, and you mentioned Dorsey.  Who is this Mr. Dorsey you keep referring to?
Speaker 2: Professor Thomas A. Dorsey, as we knew him.  We all called him Professor Dorsey.  He carried himself that way.  He was a quiet, retiring person.  He knew his music, from the jazz, and I do argue with people now that jazz and gospel is one in the same. I don't think it is.  I think of him as I did think of how the Lord changed Paul on the road to Damascus [Syria].  He changed Dr. Dorsey from writing jazz and secular to writing the church music.  At that time, the blacks needed an expression of music, and the anthems that they were singing of that day, 'Lift Up Your Heads [Ye Mighty Gates]', 'Let Mount Zion Rejoice', 'Inflammatus [et accensus]', the 'Hallelujah Chorus' [from George F. Handel's 'Messiah'], it was great.  But for some other persons of the church world, this was not the expression that they needed.
Speaker 1: And the, the Dorsey music, what style of music is that?  If it's not the anthem, what's a--what kind of songwriting is it?
Speaker 2: It, it became music with a beat, that when you would hear it sung, the spirituality or the--the emotion from the music would sort of like transcend to your body.  And you could feel the wave of the music where you would want to pat your feet.  And after awhile you would want to clap your hands.  After a while you would want to stand up and sway with the music.  And this is, this is basically what the black people wanted to do.  They wanted their own expression of music, and God opened the way through Dr. Thomas A. Dorsey.
Speaker 1: Okay, and now when is Dorsey really coming to the fore as a music maker, songwriter?
Speaker 2: I think his national fame began with the Gospel Choirs and Choruses Convention.  It was not named after him like the James Cleveland Workshop.  It was named the National Convention of Gospel Choirs and Choruses.  He and Mrs. Magnolia Lewis Butts, as I can remember and Theodore Frye, and Sallie Martin, and I'm sure there were some others I could go on and name, they put this together, I think in about 1999--1939, and I don't want to forget Mother Willie Mae Ford Smith, 'cause she was a real trooper and head of the soloists bureau in that convention until she died.  The convention met from city--different cities and different states.  They met in Cleveland [Ohio] in 1942, and at that time we were not meeting in hotels and so forth.  This was off limits to black people.  So we met in churches.  And all conventions, they had a housing committee that would go--because I was a member of the Dorsey Convention, and they would come and see how many houses--if you lived near the church where the convention was going to be, if you would let them have two rooms for the convention or other--it wasn't hotel.
Story_ID: 14594
Speaker 1: We were talking about Thomas Andrew Dorsey, the "Father of Gospel Music'.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And the, the coming together of the National Convention of Gospel Choirs and Choruses.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: And you said, at one point, it's even gonna convene here in Cleveland [Ohio].
Speaker 2: 1942.  It convened at Friendship Baptist Church [Cleveland, Ohio], East 55th [Street] and Central [Avenue].  Being at that time, Friendship was the largest church that could house a convention.  It has two full auditoriums.  They could, I'm not sure now, but they could house two church services, and they did because at one time, St. Timothy Baptist Church [Cleveland, Ohio] met there upstairs before they relocated to where they are now at 71st [Street] and Carnegie [Avenue].  And it made room, and then downstairs, there were a lot of rooms for committees and a huge kitchen and all.  And that was necessary for a convention because you had people coming out of town, and some people that would--once they would get to the place where it was, some of them never returned home.  They were there through the day, the morning session, and they'd break and there were mid-sessions in the afternoon.  And there was the night musical.  And one of our Clevelanders, who now, I think resides in Las Vegas [Nevada], Dorothy Thornton Boswell--I have a picture of her somewhere, became the national president of the youth convention.  And she was here when that happened.  She gave a speech, and they would have a contest.  And that year, the contest was oratorial.  And she spoke so, it brought the house down.  People shouted on her speech.  She was a member of St. James A.M.E [African Methodist Episcopal] Church--.
Speaker 1: Here in Cleveland?
Speaker 2: And she loved my mother [Henrietta Coleman].  And St. James Church was right up the street from our store [Coleman's and Martin's Studio Gospel Music, Cleveland, Ohio].
Speaker 1: Okay, and I always ask you know, what does that A.M.E stand for?
Speaker 2: African Methodist Episcopal.
Speaker 1: Okay, and we have some of those here in the city of Cleveland.
Speaker 2: We still do.
Speaker 1: All right.  I, I wanted to ask--you said people are coming in from all other the country--,
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --for these conventions, where they're held.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: But where is Mr. [Thomas A.] Dorsey based?
Speaker 2: His base is Chicago, Illinois.  Now, I remember one time his first store that we would write to music for us, on Oakwood Boulevard.  And then later on, he moved to another street, Ellis Avenue.  But this was also in Chicago.  Professor Dorsey did not have a store where you would walk right in and buy sheet music.  He had a house, and, and he would always have a room.  And in this room there were just stacks and stacks of music that he sold.  He was also minister of music at Pilgrim Baptist Church [Chicago, Illinois], and I think that's the only job he had.  I think Dr. [J. C.] Austin was the pastor there.  And that was a large Baptist church in Chicago with beautiful music.  And when the convention met in Chicago in 1945, I believe it was--'45 [1945] or '46 [1946], I hope I'm right.  It met in Chicago, Illinois at Pilgrim Baptist Church.
Speaker 1: Okay, is that on the South Side of Chicago?  Do you recall?
Speaker 2: I think so.  My area right now kind of eludes me, but I think so.
Story_ID: 14595
Speaker 1: I wanted to ask also about his [Rev. Thomas Dorsey] motivation for starting a convention [National Convention of Gospel Choirs and Choruses].  Because you said there's a youth division and then there's the adult grouping within the convention itself, you know, why do you need a convention?  Why bring all these singers together?  Is it just for a big concert?
Speaker 2: No, for one reason, it was to introduce gospel music into the churches.  It--that to me was a better way of putting gospel music in the church rather than he and Sallie Martin, at one time, and also Mahalia [Jackson], they would travel from city to city.  Sallie Martin was the mother organizer of different choirs and choruses in cities.  But by bringing them together, they could sing together what they had learned, have the same spiritual fervor and enjoy the fellowship because, now, you have to remember segregation was still strong in the different cities.  So these conventions, the Elks, the Mas--Masonics and all, this was a way that black people got together for the, the big word, fellowship.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And in the Dorsey Convention with the soloists bureau, and then there was the youth going on and the adult.  And during the day, there was Bible teaching and, and then at night, the singers from different areas, West Virginia, Cleveland [Ohio], Kentucky, Lexington [Kentucky], Chicago [Illinois]--they would sing.  And we were always there until twelve or one o'clock at night.
Story_ID: 14596
Speaker 1: Now you mentioned Mahalia, is that, is Mahalia Jackson?
Speaker 2: Yeah, the, the 'Queen' as they said at that time.  She sang with Dr. [Thomas A.] Dorsey for a while and traveled with him.  But I don't think her span of time was as long as Sallie Martin was because the two women were on different schools.  She was more like the concert artist.
Speaker 1: Mahalia?
Speaker 2: Yes, where Sallie Martin was the organizer, entrepreneur and going with him from different places to set it up because she told him, you're traveling around with this little bag, and you're not doing anything.  You need to set it up in a business where people can buy it and sell it.  And it was published, and he did sell.
Speaker 1: So for a time all three of them are in Chicago [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Yes, they were all in Chicago, right.
Speaker 1: So, now, where does Cleveland [Ohio]--?
Speaker 2: Chicago was considered, I think the home of the gospel music.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But Cleveland was next in line because the singers would come here, The Alex Bradford Singers [Alex Bradford and the Bradford Singers], and then, of course, Clara Ward, they went in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  But Roberta Martin, she--they had a store at 69 East 43rd Street and we would get her music.  Robert Anderson was with her, Jean Smith, Willie Webb.  And then there was Theodore R[oosevelt] Frye.  He had a studio with music in Chicago.  And he sold the Frye 'Echoes' books, and I think he published volume one all the way up to volume twenty.
Speaker 1: Okay, so it's (simultaneously)--.  Oh I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: Then there was Bowles on State Street.  Miss [Lillian] Bowles sold music too.
Speaker 1: Now, is that Chicago or Cleveland?
Speaker 2: This is all in Chicago, and I have sheet music now of all of these persons.  So all of those I'm naming you, they were in Chicago.  And the Barrett Sisters [Delois, Billie and Rodessa], especially Delois, came through Roberta Martin.  She sang with her for many years.  And let me see, who else had a store there?  Let me see, there was the Bowles music stores, there was Frye's, there was the Martin and Morris--Sallie Martin and Kenneth--Kenneth Morris was the first--person who introduced the Hammond organ into the black church.  And I don't think you can go into a church now and wouldn't see a Hammond organ.  And then there was Dorsey and Frye, and I'm trying to think if there was another one in Chicago.  I'm not sure, but those were the larger houses, the main houses of gospel music.  They published it, they arranged it, they sold it, and you could walk into their store and buy it.
Speaker 1: So if Chicago was the capital of black gospel music--,
Speaker 2: I think so.
Speaker 1: --then Cleveland was an important regional center, you think, at that point?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, because a lot of the singers would come here off and on.  Dr. Dorsey came here several times.  In fact, he had a home away from home on East 83rd Street, Deacon and, and--Odie and Della Smith.  They were members of Shiloh Baptist Church [Cleveland, Ohio].  But he had a key to their house.  All he could do is come any time and put the key in the door, and he had a room there.
Speaker 1: Well, based on what you've told me about the Dorsey Convention [National Convention of Gospel Choirs and Choruses], sounds it's, it's almost a training ground for a gospel musician?
Speaker 2: It was, it was.  It served as such.
Speaker 1: So the singers are getting quite an education?
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Story_ID: 14597
Speaker 1: Can we review for just a minute all of the various forms of education that you're getting in Cleveland [Ohio], from elementary school on, 'cause you're a young woman, young adult as the convention [National Convention of Gospel Choirs and Choruses] is coming together in the 1930s, but I'm just wondering where the roots are in the educational system in Cleveland?  Where's your elementary school?  Where is that gonna be?
Speaker 2: I attended John Burles (ph.) Elementary School [Cleveland, Ohio].  I have always, since seven years old, accompanied a group or played.  I grew up on the keyboard.
Speaker 1: Are you taking piano lessons at that point in your life?
Speaker 2: I was taking pianos. I studied piano at the Phyllis Wheatley [Center, Cleveland, Ohio].  That was at 46th [Street] and Cedar [Avenue].  It's a senior home now, but at that time, the lessons was thirty-five cent, and I think Miss Nell Gwen and Mr. Brown, there were other teachers down there.  And I could walk from my house, 57th Street, down to Cedar, and down Cedar to East 46th Street, where I would have my lesson at the Phyllis Wheatley.
Speaker 1: And so while you're a student at John Burles Elementary, you already have a job as a musician?
Speaker 2: Um-hmm, Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: Are you getting paid while you're elementary school?
Speaker 2: Yes, I was getting some pay.  I mean like ten and twelve dollars, but--,
Speaker 1: A week?
Speaker 2: --it, it paid for my music.
Speaker 1: Okay, and you said you went to--?
Speaker 2: I played for a group called the New Home Chorus.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The New Home Chorus at that time met at the Portland-Outhwaite [Recreation] Center [Cleveland, Ohio], short for the 'POC'.  This was a swimming area where we could go in the summer and swim.  I think it's still there.  I'm not sure.  But anyway, we would go there, and on Wednesday night, this New Home Chorus would meet.  And at that time, the late Professor J. Earl Hines was directing it.  I was playing, and we broadcast.  We broadcast every Sunday morning at seven o'clock over Station WHK [Cleveland, Ohio], downtown in the Terminal Tower Building.
Speaker 1: All right, now, I think I heard earlier you went to Rawlings Junior High School [Cleveland, Ohio]?
Speaker 2: Well, that would be later on, during the junior or after--at that time, I was with the elementary school.  And I went to Rawlings Junior High.
Speaker 1: Okay, and then to Central High School [later Central Middle School, Cleveland, Ohio]?
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: Now, Central has a pretty special place in the history of black America?
Speaker 2: Yes, it does.  The red, white--the red and blue.  "Yield the red and blue.  Central High, her sons and daughters, ever will be true."  And we even have an alumni, and we would meet every year and have a nice dinner dance.  And there wasn't much dancing.  It was more talking and picture snapping and where have you been and how are you and all of that.  John Stenson who is still living, a member of Antioch [Baptist Church, Cleveland, Ohio], was the president of the alumni and Jean Clayton, who was Cleveland's first black policewoman, she passed.  And he's not well now so that sort of put an end, an end to that.  And we just honored the hundredth and eleventh anniversary of Antioch Baptist Church.  And a lot of those who received their fifty-year pin are Central graduates.
Speaker 1: Okay, I know that we're--the city residents brag a lot about the fact--.
Speaker 2: Central was the school.  It was the school to attend, and if you didn't go to Central, you just, you just didn't have it.
Speaker 1: (Laughs) I know there's Langston Hughes is--.
Speaker 2: We had the best a cappella choir and the poetry writer, Langston Hughes, and I just feel today, that Central should be named after Langston Hughes.  And I love who it's named after now.  But I feel somewhere, his name should be.
Speaker 1: I believe it was recently renamed in honor of [U.S.] Congressman Louis Stokes and his brother, Carl Stokes [former mayor of Cleveland, Ohio]. So lots of important folks have come through the city of Cleveland.
Speaker 2: Love the Stokeses.
Speaker 1: Now, when did you graduate from Central High School?
Speaker 2: January 1950.  At that time, we had two graduations a year.  You could graduate January or June.  I was studying at the Cleveland Institute of Music [Cleveland, Ohio].  I was helping my mother [Henrietta Coleman] in the store and arranging music, and I felt this was more important.  So I chose to come out in January.  That was a small class, sixty-nine of us, and we were given like sixteen invitations, which is huge--that's huge to what you get now.  And it was a nice graduation.  And after that we had dinners in the different houses and took pictures and, and, and that was it.
Speaker 1: All right, so are you continuing with the piano studies through high school and beyond?
Speaker 2: Continuing at the institution, at the Cleveland Institute, but I became a composition major because I liked arranging music.  In 1944, my aunt [Viola Tate] took me to Chicago, Illinois.  She wrote a song, and she wanted it printed and published.  So we went to Chicago, and we went to [Roberta] Martin and [Kenneth] Morris Studio.  And there I met Kenneth Morris.  It was the first time I saw and met him.  And he had a little scratch pad, and she was giving him the songs, and he was doing it and writing down and taking the notes.  And I was looking at him doing that.  And I said, "I want to do that."  And that inspired me to want to become an arranger of music.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you studied composition at the Cleveland Institute of Music.
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Story_ID: 14598
Speaker 1: Okay, and then the gospel, are you just picking that up by ear or primarily working with the sheet music?
Speaker 2: We had--the sheet music was as popular then as the cassette tape or I should say video is now.  It was sheet music and every song practically that was sung, 'Jesus I Love You', 'He Knows How Much You Can Bear', [Thomas A.] Dorsey's 'The Lord Will Make a Way Somehow'.  All of those songs sold for fifteen and twenty and thirty cent.  If it was three sheets, it sold thirty cent.  If it was two, it was fifteen cent.  And if it was a single sheet, like 'Jesus I Love You' and '[My God is Real] Yes God is Real', it sold for ten cent.  And we were open every day from nine to eight in the evening, selling music, and we demonstrated music on Saturday.  The church musicians would come in, that have their choirs, and I would play it for them, and we'd sell fifty to sixty copies of music of one song, and then during the week, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, especially Tuesday and Thursday, were choir nights, all throughout the city [Cleveland, Ohio].  We would go to the different churches and demonstrate the music.  And the director would either order so many copies or they'd buy then on, on the spot.
Speaker 1: All right, so are you a full-time musician then at that point, once you leave high school [Central High School, later Central Middle School, Cleveland, Ohio]?
Speaker 2: With my studies, yes, I was full-time in the store.
Speaker 1: Okay, oh, full-time working in the business--the family--?
Speaker 2: Yes, um-hmm.
Speaker 1: And are you playing church choirs at the same time?
Speaker 2: Playing for church choirs and going to school also.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what churches were you playing for, in the '50s [1950s]?
Speaker 2: Oh, now, let me see?  Whew, I played at Olivet [Institutional Baptist Church, Cleveland, Ohio] for a while in that area, and when Olivet had a split, Reverend Ward organized his own church, Temple Baptist Church [Cleveland, Ohio]. They were not where they are now.  But I played there.  And I think I--I can say about myself, I'm sort of spiritually ecumenical because people would come in the store and they'd say--to my mother [Henrietta Coleman], they'd ask if I could play for this service because the musician was sick or out of town and I would play.  I don't know how many denominations I haven't played or touched at some point.  Morning worship, I've gone out of town with people, Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania], New York, you name it, south, where they had a group, and I accompanied the Wilson Jubilee Singers for a number of years.  Now, they were a group that sang light gospel, not heavy, but they sang anthems.  And I really love playing anthems.  They would have a concert once a year at Wills Funeral Home [Cleveland, Ohio].  Now that sounds odd, but Wills had an Egyptian room in the building where they are now, and with stars up in the ceiling and it--and when it's together, it looks just like a regular auditorium.  And every year the Wilson Jubilee Singers would have their concert there.  I accompanied them for about three or four years.
Speaker 1: Okay, so I--.
Speaker 2: At the, at the salary of fifteen dollars a month.
Speaker 1: Okay, now is that a reasonable salary for a musician?
Speaker 2: It was, it was okay.  I was in high school and I needed it for a pass, to buy, you know, a bus pass, lunch money and pay part of my tuition so it, it came in handy.
Story_ID: 14599
Speaker 1: Beyond the high school years, as I said, before, I think you mentioned at one point that you were broadcasting on the radio starting when you were a young musician in even elementary school [John Burles (ph.) Elementary School, Cleveland, Ohio]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And then the convention [National Convention of Gospel Choirs and Choruses] is helping to train singers and then sending them back to their various churches, did the radio, at that point in your life, play an important role in sort of getting the music out? What was the most popular way to educate the public about gospel?
Speaker 2: I think the radio served as a preparation for people going to church.  At that time there was another group which was a renowned spiritual group, the Wings Over Jordan.  They sang only black spirituals and they were an a cappella group.  They really possessed the airwaves at that time.  They broadcast at nine o'clock, WGAR [Cleveland, Ohio], because they had a contract into Columbia Broadcasting System [CBS radio network] in New York [New York].  Ours was local.  Theirs were, were more widespread.  And you could walk to church or stand at the bus--everyone's radio was tuned to WGAR for the Wings Over Jordan.  So our broadcast was at 7:00 A.M. in the morning.  We had to be out of their way.  And we broadcast from seven to seven thirty.  And then the Shield Brothers, not the juniors, the seniors, they would come on at 7:30 [A.M.].  And you would hear--you were getting ready for church, frying the chicken and getting the biscuits or eating, you know, and this was sort of like a, I would say, and it, it--this would help give you energy, spiritual energy to want to go to church.
Speaker 1: So these are all Sunday morning broadcasts that you just mentioned?
Speaker 2: Yes, all, all, yes, all Sunday morning.
Speaker 1: And WHK [Cleveland, Ohio], is that black-owned radio station or?
Speaker 2: No, it was white-owned.  WHK and WCLE [Cleveland, Ohio], now called WHKK [Cleveland, Ohio] were in the Terminal Tower [Building].  Now, WHK is three-quarters spiritual.  They, they come on--I hear them at 6:00 A.M. in the morning, and they have all religious music now.
Speaker 1: Okay, and this is 1930s when Wings Over Jordan is on the radio--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) This is, yes, this was like the, the early '40s [1940s], yeah.
Speaker 1: 1930s to early '40s--.
Speaker 2: The [Second] World War was declared in '41 [1941], and they also went overseas.  There are pictures of them [Wings Over Jordan] in their military uniforms going overseas to sing to the military troops.  So this was in that war period.
Speaker 1: So this is a world-famous spiritual choir?
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: That was founded here in Cleveland [Ohio]?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Do you know who the founder was?
Speaker 2: The founder was Reverend Glenn T. Settles [sic, Settle].  And I think they were founded around 1938.
Speaker 1: Oh, so late '30s [1930s].
Speaker 2: Miss, Miss Fernbanks (ph.) was their musician.  And we also have a person who's yet living that was one of the original, original members, Gladys Goodloe.  And then there was a Miss [Martha] Spearman that sang with them, Olive Thompson, [Paul] Breckenridge, most of those persons I knew because they lived in that area.
Speaker 1: So they were living right in the--.
Speaker 2: And it was housed, at that time, Wings Over Jordan was housed at Gethsemane Baptist Church [Cleveland, Ohio].
Speaker 1: Okay, so right in the central city.
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: That, all this music making is taking place.
Speaker 2: Right.
Story_ID: 14600
Speaker 1: So we have spirituals and gospel?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Concert spirituals, strictly arranged.  And in the gospel, which, to my knowledge allows for a little bit more improvisation?
Speaker 2: Yes!  Yes, oh, yes--(simultaneously).
Speaker 1: Did you like that, I see you smiling--(simultaneously).
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, oh, yes.
Speaker 1: Well, why is the improvisation important to gospel musicians?
Speaker 2: Because persons are coming up--if we go back into slavery, and we check the messages of the music, you know, (singing) "Ride on King Jesus, ride on, conquer the kingdom," didn't necessarily mean ride on King Jesus.  It meant we have conquered a way to get out of this area where we are slaves.  'Steal Away', these were messages.  And the black people still had this message within us, and if you look at most of the traditional gospel music, it's the message more or less like Dr. [Thomas A.] Dorsey's song, 'The Lord Will Make a Way Somehow,' he compares to, like a ship that's tossed and driven.  And I was on the ocean thirteen days going to Japan, so I know what he meant, the ups and downs of life that black people had, and working in the, as households in white families and not being paid.  I remember my aunt going to work as far as Lorain, Ohio, going downtown and then catching the bus out there, working eight hours just for two dollars and fifty cents.  And, and so the emotionalism told of how they felt.  As Kenneth [Morris] sang, when he wrote, '[My God is Real] Yes, God is Real', the, the men were talking about what they knew this, and how much academia they knew this, then they do this--they didn't have this.  And he said, "But there are things I may not know.  There are some places I cannot go.  But there's one thing I know for sure, that God is real for I feel him down in my soul."  And that's what the black people wanted.  They wanted to feel something, not as much as emotion, but to know they had an inner-spiritual being person that was with them all the time 'cause this was their only protection.
Speaker 1: And this is Kenneth Morris who's composing 'Yes, God is Real'?
Speaker 2: Yes, he wrote, and yes, and it's been transferred into eight, eight different languages.
Speaker 1: Okay, so the improvisation that allows for that emotionalism to come out?
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm, yes.
Speaker 1: And that's appropriate?
Speaker 2: It's appropriate.  I have, I have taught my choirs songs and the words, that the text of the word didn't seem to--the, the English understanding or sentence didn't give the right understanding to what the text of the song should be.  So I have changed the words, and not rewritten someone's music, but just enlarged on it where they could really feel it.  And I have done some where they've liked the verse I did more than the--for one example, Charles Nicks [Jr.] wrote, 'Hold Back the Night'.  He's a musician in Detroit [Michigan] of great renown.  I mean his choir did concerts with the Detroit Symphony [Orchestra], so he was way up there.  But he wrote this song, 'Hold Back the Night'.  And, and the first verse he wrote was, I think, was "a storm is raging down."  But he didn't have a second verse, and, and sort of being acquainted with hymns, you know, there's the hymn addressing, then the second one, and the third of you, whereas the man who wrote, "when peace like a river attendeth my way." He had lost four girls in the ocean.  And the last one tells the verse, he expects to see his wife and those four daughters again.  And I like to have an ending, you know, to the song, a, a real spiritual actually.  So I wrote another verse to it, and they sang that verse more than they sang the one that he composed.  And I've done that quite often with choirs, being a choral arranger.  I feel sometimes, this song needs to say a little more than this.  The jazz artists did all the time.  They add to what they sang.  And, and I don't think the real composers mind that.  I think they just are glad that they have a song given to them spiritually that other people would enjoy singing.  Now, there are some songs you can't do that.  'He Knows How Much You Can Bear', there's nothing you can do but sing as it is.  'Take my Hand, Precious Lord' [sic, 'Precious Lord, Take My Hand'], I've heard it sung every way you can imagine.  I've heard it played by a symphony orchestra.  I've heard the quartets sing it till they wear it down with a beat.
Story_ID: 14601
Speaker 1: So where are the major sources of inspiration for gospel composers and gospel singers?  And I ask the question because I'm thinking about 'Amazing Grace', which wasn't written by--,
Speaker 2: A black person.
Speaker 1: --a black person.  But--,
Speaker 2: We think it's our song.
Speaker 1: --one of my teachers said it wasn't written by us, but it was written for us, one of my teachers told me.  And so can you tell me about 'Amazing Grace' and how that came to be accepted as gospel music and how the music has grown over the year?
Speaker 2: I think it speaks to the black people as one of our anthems because the man who, who wrote it lived to see what the blacks were going through.  He was a slave trader.  And this is why our songs are called soul because we lived our songs.  Most of the anthems are scripture text from the Bible, but we've lived it.  And when he saw how the blacks were being treated on the ship, just, just like animals, packed together like sardines, it had to come into his thought.  Why is this happening, you know, to this, to these people?  I'm not sure, in the history I've read of him, whether or not he owned slaves, but he would go to Africa and get them and bring them back.
Speaker 1: Now, who is this?  Who's doing this?
Speaker 2: John Newton.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And he was convicted in doing that.  He finally gave that up.  He just stopped and God gave him that song.  And when you think of it, "'Twas grace that got me safe thus far, and grace will lead me home, through many dangerous toils and snares, I have already come,"  the dangerous waters are bringing them and seeing how those slaves would jump, abort ship and die rather than to go from bondage to bondage, you know, and they did not know where they were going.  They didn't know the language.  They were frightened people, taken from their own homeland, carried somewhere that they knew nothing about for a job and a journey of life that was not relevant to their style.
Story_ID: 14602
Speaker 1: Mother Thompson, we were talking just a minute ago about 'Amazing Grace' and John Newton writing that hymn during the era of the slave trade.  So he's creating a song in the nineteenth century and by the twentieth century, it's an important part of the sacred music tradition of the descendants of some of those very people who were enslaved on ships that, that he captained.  And then we have this important era that you told us about with [Rev.] Thomas Dorsey, where gospel music is coming into its own in the 1930s.  And so a lot of times you hear people refer to the Dorsey Era as the traditional era in gospel music--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) It is the traditional gospel music.  And I think one of the points I'd like to interject is, about 'Amazing Grace' is that it can and still is sung any way.  It has been song in the long meter, (singing) "amazing grace/how sweet the sound/that saved a wrench like me,"  (singing)  "a-a-a-y."  It's been sung that way.  It's been sung as a hymn (singing) "Amazing grace, how sweet the sound."  Then it was sung the way Aretha Franklin did it with a beat, and the Southern California [Community] Choir, with  [Rev.] James Cleveland directing and it, and it had a gospel beat then.  And this is what has preserved a lot of the traditional gospel music because it has that overall soul beat, that pat your foot, that home, family style, in the room, family singing together. It is, it's not dressed up and carried out and, you know, and it doesn't have the choreography that today's music has because in those days the singers, the Roberta Martin Singers, the Sallie [Martin], Della Reese and all, they could not do all of that emotional jumping and in the churches 'cause a lot of them wouldn't accept it.  For one thing, the black ministers wouldn't accept it.  They equated it to jazz, and they said they were not gonna have that jazz in their church.
Speaker 1: So what is it then that's making this, this very popular hymn, by a white man from Britain in the eighteenth century a part of black gospel music?  Is it the movement and the emotionalism that blackens--?
Speaker 2: It's, it's more the words.
Speaker 1: The words.
Speaker 2: I think the words have sent a message to us.  There are some songs, 'Take My Hand Precious Lord' is another one.  I akin that to 'Amazing Grace' because when it says "I am weak, I'm worn, I'm tired, through the storm, through the rain, hold my hand". These were things--you have to realize in this era, there was [The Great] Depression, there was the WPA [Works Progress Administration] system.  There was the, the labor where people worked hard for money, but they were paid little.  And the food then consisted of the greens and the sweet potatoes and the salt pork and the navy beans and the black eyed peas and the cornbread.  This was the sta--and the neck bones--and I still love them.  This was the stable of the black persons.  And those songs gave strength to black people.
Speaker 1: And so John Newton's capturing all that, and you think that's what makes it easy for it to be adopted to this different situation, or adapted?
Speaker 2: I think so.  I think so because I think in some way or another, God gave him the heart to look on what had been done.  These are still a human person and look what you're doing to him.  You're bringing them over here to be massacred and murdered and beaten and tried.  And, and, you know, and, and I want to interject this right now, which is far removed from it, but I saw the picture Mel Gibson did of the '[The] Passion of [the] Christ' and everyone said there was too much bloodshed, too much violence.  But do they think about all the bloodshed that the blacks--that they--they were beaten and whipped and dragged and tarred and feathered and hung up on trees.  What could have been more violent than that?  If they just saw a black person walking down the road.  "I don't like him.  Let's--."  And it, it's as late as Jasper, Texas [lynching death of James Byrd Jr.] here in the twentieth century, so it hasn't gone anywhere.  We just don't see it every day.  They still--it's still alive in some places.
Story_ID: 14603
Speaker 1: I believe I read somewhere, where, that [Rev.] Thomas Dorsey said, "Gospel music was the good news in bad times."
Speaker 2: It was.  It was, it was.  A lot of his songs, he wrote another song that I like, we sold a lot, (singing) "I don't know why I have to cry sometimes/I don't know why I have to sigh sometimes/there will be a perfect day when the tears are rolled away/I don't why/but I'll know by and by."  People could sing that.  And they could, it was a tune that they could sit in their house.  When the women were in the kitchen and the clothes were in the tub soaking and on the rub board.  That's that little board that sat in the tub where you rubbed it, cause they could sing that.  And they could beat (singing), "the Lord will make a way", and the rub board would be going.  It would have the tune, and they would be singing it.
Speaker 1: Okay, well, if those are the feelings then and those are the ideas that we associate with Dorsey's music from the '30s [1930s] forward, I suppose the times are changing as we move through the twentieth century.  Do you see a point at which gospel music begins to change and move in a different direction?
Speaker 2: I, I saw it, especially during the era of the coming of, of--I think with The Caravans, 'cause James Cleveland was with them.  I'm not sure he was their first musician.  But with he and the Clara Ward Singers, gospel music did begin to change.  And then bringing into the class, the choral era, when Robert Frye (ph.) wrote 'God Is'.  Now, that's a song that is still being sung.  He's with the Lord now, but when James Cleveland sang it--who else-- (singing) "God is my joy in the time of sorrow," you know, a person could sing that.  And I would hear people singing, had little voice, no voice, big voice, great voice--they just wanted to know, they could sing that song.  And I loved 'God Is'--I still like 'God Is'.
Story_ID: 14604
Speaker 1: Okay, now if [Rev. Thomas] Dorsey and Mahalia Jackson and Sallie [Martin] and Roberta Martin and they are coming, they are coming up as gospel stars of sorts in the '30s [1930s], '40s [1940s] and '50s [1950s]--,
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Entrepreneurs, yes.
Speaker 1: --where do you get this era of James Cleveland, this next generation?  Where is that beginning?
Speaker 2: I think that if, if we could go further, a little bit back, Roberta Martin introduced it with her choral sound.  She had a gospel group, but they were more choral than just regular gospel.  They didn't jump and all of that, but she had a group of fine young women, Bessie Folk, Delois Barrett [Campbell], Eugene Smith, Norsalus McKissick and Willie Webb.  That's the group I remembered.  And they would sing, and, and, of course, in those days most singers wore robes.  And Norsalus had such a power, when he'd sing, 'He Knows How Much You Can Bear', he would stand straight.  When he did move, the whole church moved with him.  The words then and melody took those songs over.  And the groups then were more like evangelist.  They were spreading the word.  They wanted you to know Christ.  Even the [Clara] Ward Singers, though they went to on to Caesar's Palace [Las Vegas, Nevada].  They put out 'Surely God is Able' with Marion Williams, and it sold--we could not keep enough copies in the store (singing) "because he is able/I know he is able to carry you through," and you could get an old sister in the corner and hear that, they get to patting and singing, "don't you know God is able,"oh, yes.  That was a song then.
Speaker 1: That's in the 1940s or?
Speaker 2: This, yes, this in the middle--this is after the war, World War II, coming into 1947 and '48 [1948], when the Clara Ward Singers were very popular.  They'd come to Cleveland [Ohio] and do a program.  And like I say, it was more evangelist because would open the doors of the church for people to join.  They'd have prayer, and even though they would lift an offering, the singers then were really more dedicated, I think, to the craft of going to spread what God had given them, this good news in this gospel singing.  And we had a man in Cleveland [Avenue]--I'm not sure what happened to him.  His name was Reverend Lucas.  He had a church at 36th [Street]  and Central [Avenue], and in the summertime, he would have a tent in the back of the church, 'cause I played for his broadcast a while.  And the singers would come and do a week.  And he had [Beatrice] Bea Brown from Indianapolis [Indiana], and she would brings James Lee and Kenneth Woods, and [Sister] Winona Carr of Cleveland, Ohio sang with her for a while.
Speaker 1: So if this is, it's the late '40's [1940s] and early 1950s that you're starting to see some of these changes?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, (unclear) (simultaneously)--.
Story_ID: 14605
Speaker 1: James Cleveland is, is sort of watching this--I've heard him referred to as the Prince--,
Speaker 2: Prince of gospel music.
Speaker 1: --of gospel music.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.  He was coming on the horizon.  And I think the trail that he did really put him in the forefront to do this because he started in Chicago [Illinois] and attended church with his grandmother, Holiness Church.  And then he did work with the Roberta Martin Singers, and he went on from there to Detroit [Michigan].  He lived with Aretha Franklin and played in her father's [C.L. Franklin] church.  He was really getting it all along the, the trail.  And then from there to, I think New Jersey where he recorded 'Peace Be Still' and then from there on to California because as they say, the rest is history.  But when you can do a trailblazing like that, you, you collect as you go.  Then it came into his mind, to further gospel music for young people.  So he organized the James Cleveland workshop [Gospel Music Workshop of America].  I think it's now in its thirty-sixth year.
Speaker 1: Okay, so--.
Speaker 2: And they have chapters throughout the country.  They're--I think they started a chapter in Africa, and they do have a chapter in the Bahamas.  And the last time I went, year before last, there was a group there from Japan that sang.  And one of the young men offered his composition in the workshop packet.
Speaker 1: So when--if I'm not mistaken, when James Cleveland is recording 'Peace Be Still', we're just getting into the 1960s.
Speaker 2: I think so.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Mm-hm.
Speaker 1: So is this a new kind of gospel music then?
Speaker 2: Yes, this, this was a new kind of gospel.  It had a different beat, and it was, it was attracting more young people.  And that was the thing about it.  It was attracting more young people that were interested in knowing, where can I go with this music?  How can we young people be included in it, because a lot of the groups coming out then were younger people.  They weren't--they didn't have the matronly look of Sallie Martin and probably the [Clara] Ward [Singers] and Roberta [Martin]--they were newer, younger people.  There was Richard Smallwood of Washington [D.C.], coming out with--oh, I'm thinking--I can't think of his first number.  Then there was Alex Bradford from New Jersey, and he wrote 'Too Close'.  And he had a very low voice, but he could raise it very high, and the people got attracted to that.  And then the Raymond Raspberry Singers from Cleveland [Ohio], they were recording.  And I think this was another thing, the recording music was becoming more popular.  There was Savoy [Records], Decca [Records] and there was the Red Label,  but then it was beginning more to focus on these newer, younger groups.  And there was a Jewish fellow, [Fred] Mendelssohn, he worked with James [Cleveland] 'til he died.  He recorded a lot of the black groups on specialty, [Rev.] Joe Mays--now, he was a traditional.  The O'Neal twins [Edward and Edgar] are a lot of those persons.
Speaker 1: So the [Rev. Thomas] Dorsey era from roughly 1930 to 1960?
Speaker 2: I would say all the way up to 1960, that it was really in vogue.
Speaker 1: And then the James Cleveland era, if it starts around 1960--?
Speaker 2: Crossed into that, right.
Story_ID: 14606
Speaker 1: What's gonna distinguish this Gospel Music Workshop of America, James Cleveland music, from the [Rev. Thomas] Dorsey music?  Is it just that younger people are doing it?  Is the instrumentation different?  The makeup of the groups different, size wise?  I know you talked about quartets and--.
Speaker 2: Well, the James Cleveland workshop is larger than the Dorsey, number one.  I think, number two, they have attracted more young people.  They--and the, the, the unique part of it, it is a workshop.  They have classes every day from eight thirty in the morning to three thirty in the afternoon.  Any type of music that you would want to know about the instrumentation, the drums, theory, choir directing, solo singing, there is a class for that, computer classes.  There was classes in how to put your notes down on papers.  All of that has expanded the James Cleveland workshop.  Now, the Dorsey convention [National Convention of Gospel Choirs and Choruses] didn't have that.  They had more singing and preaching and the soloists' bureau and other.  I'm not sure now, I do know a young lady that's still attending.  And they're doing some newer things now.  But James Cleveland has more of this.  Also, going on out further, the Hawkins [Edwin Hawkins Singers] who did 'Oh Happy Day'.  Walter and his brother, Edwin, they have what they call the Music & Arts Seminar.  I'm not sure how large it is.  They came to Cleveland [Ohio] once.  And I remember Jerry Thomas working with them.  But, by far, right now, musically, the James Cleveland workshop [Gospel Music Workshop of America] is the largest.
Story_ID: 14607
Speaker 1: So with the [Rev. Thomas] Dorsey choral music is perhaps piano accompaniment?  He's a keyboard man, I understand.
Speaker 2: Yes, he, he was.
Speaker 1: He was.
Speaker 2: But there's an organ with it now.
Speaker 1: And then you said the Hammond organ is coming in within the Dorsey era?
Speaker 2: Kenneth Morris brought it in.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I'm sure all the conventions have Hammonds, two, three of them in each segment.  And if you hear any tape now, you'll hear the organ plus, plus now, in this, what they call nu-gospel, N-U, dash gospel, G-O-S-P-E-L, the keyboard is the reigning instrument now.  And you can see them on the video of Dottie Peoples and Yolanda [Adams] and Donnie McClurkin, they have two and three keyboards stacked.
Speaker 1: So electronic keyboards.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously)  So the--yeah, the electronic age is--this is what you call the electronic era now.  The Hammond is still there, but the electronic era is really taken it over.
Speaker 1: And what's the attraction?  Are you synthesizing different instruments, the sound of different instruments?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) I think because of the, the--for one thing, it's easy to carry.  I guess that's why it's, they're contemporary.  You can pick up a keyboard and take it with you anywhere, plug it in.  It has a sound system.  Can't do that with an organ, with the Hammond and even some pianos.  They have electric pianos.  I don't care for the sound.  It has that sound that, it's not like the real wood instrument.  I prefer the eighty-eight keys.  I've played them all, but, but I like that better.  But I think--and, and not only that, a lot of the musicians that accompany in the church are also in the jazz era too.  I've known keyboardists and pianists who play in the clubs and then play in the church the next day.  I wouldn't do it.  I, I never mixed the two.  But a lot of them do it, and then we also have some who are instrumentalists that are working in symphonies, symphonic orchestras because there are a lot of concerts now where you see the violin, the viola and--.
Speaker 1: Gospel concerts?
Speaker 2: Gospel concerts--gospel music will never die.  It's here to stay.
Story_ID: 14608
Speaker 1: Well, stylistically, even within gospel music, where are you now, at the beginning of the twenty-first century?  Do you have a preference for [Rev. Thomas] Dorsey's style over James Cleveland's style, over Dottie Peoples's style or are we comfortable playing all of those styles?
Speaker 2: I'm comfortable with all of them. There're--I think some of it stems on what variety--what people you're working with.  You can be versatile in a church.  Now, I'm working at a church now.  We have an adult ensemble, and they sing a lot of Kurt Carr's music, Richard Smallwood, and Kirk Franklin.  Some of the people I worked with come up under the traditional era.  They don't relate to that well in the singing style.  So I have the gospel chorus and we do more traditional.  And then we do some of, we do some of the nu.  It just depends on how it's arranged and what it's saying.
Speaker 1: Is that Nu-gospel?
Speaker 2: Yes, 'cause I have to read the words.  I have a piece on the piano now that's a, I would say a contemporary--but I like what she did--I like the words when she said, "you came for me," and I, and that thought came to me when I was looking at the portrayal of Christ, the beatings and all of that, he came for me 'cause he didn't have to leave his home in glory but he did it cause there was no one else that could, have the innocent blood that would be shed for the sins that I may have done, didn't know I was gonna do, and yet, I'm hoping I won't do.  We're all just sinners saved by grace.
Story_ID: 14609
Speaker 1: Now, you have this title of 'Mother', Helen Turner-Thompson, minister of music, so what does that mean, for the work that you're involved in on a daily basis or a weekly?  But it's just what kinds of things are you called upon to do in the community?
Speaker 2: I do most of the funerals for the three churches where I'm involved.  I work with two congregational churches, and one American Baptist church, and I have done funerals at other places where the funeral home may call me.  I do that, and I also have piano students at Lee Memorial Baptist Church.  Reverend Wesley Reed (ph.) is the pastor, and they lost their minister of music.  She went home with the Lord, and he--they left a scholarship fund.  And these five little students are playing 'This Little Light of Mine' and other things, 'Für Elise' [Beethoven] in the classical world.  And, what else do I do?  Oh, my gosh.  I'm getting this bio-book together, which I hope this company is going to publish it for me, which will have more in detail of what I've talked to you about 'cause I have some of the, the notes written out actually that I want put in the book.
Speaker 1: For your autobiography?
Speaker 2: Yes, for my autobiography.
Speaker 1: May I ask the names of the congregations that you're working with now, as a minister of music?
Speaker 2: I work with the Euclid Avenue Congregational Church [Cleveland, Ohio].  I work with Mount Zion Congregational Church [Cleveland, Ohio], and also presently at Antioch Baptist Church [Cleveland, Ohio].
Speaker 1: Okay, I, I wonder too, as a minister of music, are you called upon to speak or is it primarily through the music, that you're delivering a message?
Speaker 2: No, I have, I have done speaking engagements.  I have spoken for Women's Day.  I have gone to churches--oh, just at Olivet [Institutional Baptist Church, Cleveland, Ohio], they had a fall and spring institute, and I taught the music there.  I had a class there, and I had a class at Mount Sinai Baptist Church [Cleveland, Ohio], and I've gone out to Baldwin-Wallace [College, Berea, Ohio] and introduced gospel music to them.  I have a tape where I presented gospel music at the Unitarian Church in Shaker Heights [Ohio].  And I'm reminded of the verse where the, the Lord said, "Your gift will make room for you and open many doors".  I've even ministered in prisons.  I worked at the Cuyahoga Hills boys prison [Cuyahoga Hills Juvenile Correctional Facility, Highland Hills, Ohio] for seven years, had a choir out there.  I had a choir at the Cleveland Job Corps, and they sang in New York and Texas and so forth.  And I've done all of this.  I've even gone to senior homes where the seniors were in the early stages of Alzheimer's [disease] and ministered music to them.  I've done some of all of it.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you've been able to take a sacred music into those various settings?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And [Cleveland] Job Corps, which is a tax supported--,
Speaker 2: Mm-hm.
Speaker 1: --I guess training program--,
Speaker 2: Government oriented, yes.
Speaker 1: --for young women?
Speaker 2: Yes--,
Speaker 1: Federally supported.
Speaker 2: I've taken gospel music there, and I've also taught in a few classical arranged pieces that would fit.  And they did--secular music to me is songs like 'I Believe', 'My Hero', 'My Buddy,' what's this song that Lionel Richie wrote?
Speaker 1: 'Jesus is Love'?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, songs like that.  They did all of that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And 'Climb Every Mountain', the theme song of [Cleveland] Job Corps was 'You'll Never Walk Alone'.
Story_ID: 14610
Speaker 1: I'm wondering too, just because I've heard and some of this I've seen, as a lifetime member of the Baptist Church, that the church can sometimes be a very conservative institution.  And, and often that means that women are not prominently featured in certain areas of leadership within the church.  Has that been your experience in working with various congregations as a minister of music?
Speaker 2: In some places where I've gone, they have been very careful, the, the minister, you know, as they say, to put you in your place, because we must face it, the really gospel was preached through men.  And they sort of relate that back to the era when Christ was on this earth.  He chose twelve men.  At that time, men were at the forefront.  Women were at home behind the scenes; shy, bashful, raising children.  And, and then through Paul's era, women began to preach because he said it in the scriptures, "I would that a woman preach rather than teach", and he used them.  Romans, chapter sixteen, it names the women that he used. And I think some time when we look at the root of the church, the historical background, how it got its start, then we can relate to the fact that the primitive Baptist Church has no women preachers or for long periods of time the Church of God in Christ did not have women preachers, where in PAW, Pentecostal Assemblies of the World, did entertain women preachers.  So it depends on the background of the church, the history of how it started.
Speaker 1: So is that a sign of progress then that more women are gaining acceptance--,
Speaker 2: They are--.
Speaker 1: --in various congregations?
Speaker 2: We have a woman bishop now [Reverend Dr. Vashti] McKenzie who's in the A.M.E [African Methodist Episcopal church], diocese and there are women now pastoring and some of them are married and some are not married, but they've chosen a vocation, and I feel that if, if the vocation that God wants us to have--we are workmanship as Reverend Marion Waite (ph.) said it, Wednesday night in our Lenten service.  If we ever get it down in us what our workmanship with, is with Christ, we can do the work that we should do.  I'm not a pulpiteer where I've got to get up in the pulpit and expound about--and I have taught, had Bible classes, taught Sunday school, taught missionary and all of that.  Some of us are evangelist in our work that we do.  I have never--I don't think I've ever played for just one church or had a choir at one church.  I've always had two or three churches that I've worked around some where or other.  If it wasn't the women--for years, when I was at Shiloh Baptist Church [Cleveland, Ohio], every Women's Day, I would go up to (unclear) senior, because at that time, it was Women's Day, so it was all a woman director, organist and Marcello would come, Daisy Bray from St. Timothy.  Men's Day, they would try to have all men, you know, doing it.  And so I've had an interaction, I guess, with so many churches, I feel like I just have this one great big church of Cleveland [Ohio] and wherever the door opens, I will--and I think it's been an asset 'cause I've played in Pentecostal Churches, Methodist Church, Episcopal, Baptist, all over.  I--for eight years I served as minister of music at St. Peter's A.M.E Zion.  I had the adult choir and the children.  And minister really did approve of the things that I did.  We worked very well together.
Speaker 1: So gospel music has gained popular acceptance?
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: Locally at least.
Speaker 2: And then I've worked where I've had complete anthem choirs, plus the gospel music, and then the children, you know, different--but as they have moved on, I'm comfortable where I am.
Story_ID: 14611
Speaker 1: At the end of the last segment, we said we would focus more the private life and the balancing act that you do as a working woman and wife and then mother.  So I wondered if you could tell me about your courtship and marriage.  When did all that take place?
Speaker 2: Oh, my gosh, let me see.  I know we were married, July 7, 1951.  We were married at Mount Sinai Baptist Church.  We had a formal wedding.  I had the traditional one, two, three solos.  A trio sang the Lord's Prayer.  One soloist, I can't forget her, still living, Clara Cottiledge (ph.), sang 'My Hero'.  And I had another soloist that sang 'Because'.  Those were the wedding songs of the day.
Speaker 1: And what was the groom's name?
Speaker 2: Donald Thompson, Sr.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And we grew up around the same neighborhood together.  His family lived on Central, and we were on Cedar.  His family grew up in Lane Metropolitan C.M.E [Christian Methodist Episcopal] Church, which at that time was Colored Methodist Episcopal.  It's now Christian [Methodist Episcopal].  And the church is still at 46th and Cedar.  And I said to him--oh, I met him at the swimming pool, odd place to meet.  And we were talking and, and there were a group of us together.  And then he followed me home, and we talked.  And I asked him what church was he going to.  At that time, he wasn't going to church.  I said, "Oh, well, then, you know, we--oh, but when I go to church, I go to Lane Metropolitan. " I said, "Okay, "  I said, "I bet I know all the people at your church."  "No, you don't know the people at my church."  So we went to Lane.  And we visited, and at that time, the pastor of Lane was Reverend Breeding, and what Donald didn't know, that every Saturday, Reverend Breeding would come to 86th and Cedar--there was a live chicken house across from us, up the street.  He would buy a live chicken, and they cut it and feather it and all that.  Then he would always walk back down the street to our store and stop in and speak to us because my grandmother [Martha Coleman] knew his great uncle who was president of Lane College [Jackson, Tennessee] at that time.  Mom [Henrietta Coleman] studied there for a while.  And so he said, "I want you to come to church one Sunday and sing a solo.  I want you to sing 'Move Up a Little Higher'."  I said, "No problem."  So I told Donald we're--"I'm going to church with you this Sunday."  He didn't know I was gonna sing.  I didn't tell him I was gonna sing.  So then Reverend Breeding called on me to sing, and, of course, in the Methodist church, they didn't do a lot of that, but folks got to shouting that Sunday and running around the church, (slapping sound) patting on their knees and everything.  And he, oh, he was proud then.  Oh, his chest stuck way out.  His girlfriend can sing and all of that.  And that started our relationship.  He would go to church with me, and then he worked at a night club out on 105 [Street] as a bouncer.  And you know what a bouncer is.  That's the one keeps things in order and all of that.  And he got tired of that, and then he changed and worked downtown for a while.  But Uncle Sam caught up with him.  And he had two brothers that preceded him in the military, and he said, "I'll never volunteer, but if I get called, I'll go."  So October 1950, he was inducted in the service, and he went to Fort Leonard--no, Fort Knox, Kentucky.  I visited a couple of times there.  And then on July 7, '51 [1951], we, we got married.  He went on back, and I was still in school studying at the institute, degreed studies.  And he got out for a while, but he stayed in the, the military unit, the guard--National Guard.  So he went away one summer and come back, and he said, "I've decided to make it a career."  So I said, "Well, I'll go with you."  And he said, "But the first stop will be Japan."
Story_ID: 14612
Speaker 1: So we went to Japan.  And when I left going to Japan, Donnie was eighteen months.
Speaker 2: Now, that's your first child?
Speaker 1: My first child.  And we were on ship thirteen days.  We were on a Navy ship, the U.S.[S.] [General] Mann, going to Japan.  And that was the entrance of, of my learning about military life, and what it was--and I sang while I was there.  And I also had a group.  And we sang a couple of times in the chapel.  And I would sing every Sunday morning.  I would do the eight o'clock, nine o'clock, ten o'clock service at a different chapel.  And we had--if there were twenty-five or more persons of a definite denomination that wanted a minister, they'd either send back to the states for a chaplain, but I did the music.  And I sang oratorial music, classical music, 'Oh Rest in the Lord'.  I did a lot of [Franz] Schubert and [Felix] Mendelssohn pieces, and, and I did spirituals.  And then from there, we went to Fort Jackson, South Carolina.  Both my daughters were born in Japan.  We went to Fort Jackson, South Carolina, and we were there for a while.  And then from there to Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri, and we were there three years.  I sang in the oratorial group there, had a gospel group, and we went off-post and sang in St. Louis [Missouri] and Kansas City [Missouri] cause being in Missouri was like Fort Leonard Wood, being in the boondocks.  You were away from everything.  But military life is interesting.
Story_ID: 14613
Speaker 1: Now you mentioned that your first child was Donnie, so he's named after his father, Donald [Thompson]?
Speaker 2: They're all military brats.
Speaker 1: All of them.  So could you give me their names and birth order?
Speaker 2: Let me see now, Donald Thompson, Jr. is the oldest.  He was born October the 21st, 1953.  He is now residing with his wife in Dallas, Texas.  My oldest daughter, Mrs. Yvonne Moore, lives in Cleveland [Ohio], on East 79th Street, 1921.  She's in that Lexington Village [a neighborhood in Cleveland] area, and she works as an intake supervisor for the Human Services, Virgil Brown.  And my third daughter, Janet, she lives in East Cleveland, and she's a student right now at [Cuyahoga] Community College.  And she made the dean's list on her first returning to school.  And she has my last grandson, Jeremy, who likes to travel with his grandma, and, and he has a keyboard, and he's learning music.  He's trying to play the guitar and drums.  My last son, I think has all of my musical talents.  He sings, plays the organ, keyboard and everyone falls in love with Mark.  He's like a public figure.  He's playing at several churches in the city.  He accompanies me on different programs and so forth.
Speaker 1: And how many grandchildren do you have?
Speaker 2: I have five grandchildren. My oldest grandchild is a daughter, Mrs. Yvonne Hunnicutt.  She works in the educational scholastic program downtown.  And then the, my oldest grandson, Steve, is home resting between his jaunts with the [U.S.] Navy.  He was stationed in, at Seattle, Washington.  The two--Mark's grandchildren, I told you, they're in school and Jeremy is the youngest.
Story_ID: 14614
Speaker 1: I heard you say that you had twelve years of experience as a military wife?
Speaker 2: (Nods for yes).
Speaker 1: Okay, and what span of years did that cover?
Speaker 2: Let me see, 1954 to 1970.  I think we traveled--I traveled with him about eleven years consecutive.  Then I had to come back to Cleveland [Ohio] because he was stationed in Vietnam.  We thought we were going, but we didn't get to go.
Speaker 1: Okay, so the 1960s--
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) He was going in the combat area.
Speaker 1: Okay, so the family couldn't travel with him there?
Speaker 2: And so we came back to Cleveland [Ohio].  And after coming back here, then I just stayed here.
Speaker 1: Okay, so that ended the military experience.
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) And  the marriage also.
Speaker 1: And the marriage also.  Okay.  So, now--.
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) He's [Donald Thompson] deceased.  He died last year, this month, 24th of March, 2003.
Story_ID: 14615
Speaker 1: In the 1960s then you're a single working mother?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Head of household?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Four children?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, and you're playing for churches still?
Speaker 2: Three.
Speaker 1: Three churches?
Speaker 2: I was playing between--pardon me--I think I was playing between--I started with Shiloh [Baptist Church] in 1965.  And I worked with my sister Bea Frost, 1964 to 2000.  I worked there assisting her with the gospel choir on their concerts, their off-church engagements.  And--.
Speaker 1: And you said that was at Shiloh?
Speaker 2: That was at Greater Abyssinian [Baptist Church].
Speaker 1: (simultaneously) Greater Abyssinian--.
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) And then I was, I was full-time at Shiloh [Baptist Church].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I worked there also.  And at that time, I went to Job Corps in '71 [1971], part time.  The National Baptist Convention met here in Cleveland [Ohio] at that time.  And all of us had, were brought together by Reverend Cabnes (ph.) to do the music.  And I was working with the gospel era, Woods, Dr. Woods and Steele, and Finley and all of them were with the anthems because we did anthems, and also we did hymns.  We did three different types of music in that convention.  I did one solo hymn with them, 'Jesus Paid It All'; I won't forget that.  And then at that same time, I went to work at Job Corp part-time.  And I established a choir there.
Speaker 1: So it sounds like you're working seven days a week?
Speaker 2: It's just about like that now.
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: Almost the same thing.
Speaker 1: And that's the good news?
Speaker 2: That's the good news.  I'm slowing down.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: I really am trying to slow down.  But I think when you're married to something that you enjoy doing, it's sort of like a labor of love.
Story_ID: 14616
Speaker 1: I'm thinking about some of the things that are happening in the world in the 1960s.  As you said, there are changes in your household and how things have to run there, and changes in the world of work with your entering Job Corps on a part-time basis and continuing with the music.  And then it's right in the heyday of the Civil Rights Movement.
Speaker 2: Right, and in, so, in being in that era, I was fortunate and blessed to hear Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] personally.  He came to Shiloh [Baptist Church] twice.  He came one Sunday and spoke as, he said, he said, "I'm a preacher here today, not a civil rights leader."  And he spoke for Reverend [Amos] Waller's anniversary.  And then another time he came when he was in his civil rights capacity.  Also I did a lot of music for the mayor at that time who was Carl Stokes.  The choirs would sing, you know, different places.  And, and I was working at Job Corps part time, and the children were like my congregation at home.  We had our Friday night games of Monopoly and Easy Money, and I took them to a lot of the museums in the state.  This was their joy.  And they went to summer camps also.  And they were studying music.  And let me see what else, when [Senator] Robert [F.] Kennedy died, our church was asked to do the music for the memorial.  And we did it.  And this, our music rendition was heard all over.  It was on satellite.  I got many letters from various parts of the state, how they enjoyed the music that was selected for that era.  It wasn't easy working and being the single parent.  And I look at some mothers today and I think about my era.  It's not--they don't have it any easier.  I think it's a little harder, but it's about organizing yourself, dealing with the pressures, knowing that you can't do everything.  And some things do get left out, spending more time with the children.  We think sometime we work days and come home, maybe we should have worked nights and been home in the day, and I have walked up to the school at times and the children didn't know I was coming.  And the PTA [Parent-Teacher Association] and different things like that.  So you're not an octopus, but you almost carry the weight of one with the arms and the legs here there and every I'm saying that.  But mothers are extra special in whatever they do because they have a heavier load.
Story_ID: 14617
Speaker 1: With four children coming of age then in the 1960s and '70s [1970s] and watching all of these changes in the, in the African American community especially because of civil rights, did you see that the church in Cleveland [Ohio] was playing an active role in transforming the society in the same way that Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] and [Rev.] Jesse Jackson and Andrew Young and [Rev.] Ralph [Abernathy]--Rev. [James] Bevel?
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) Well, some, some of the messages we got from the church that we were traveling too fast.  Some of them were saying that they felt maybe Dr. King was an island, doing it all by himself.  And I think the August summer, the March on Washington [1963], did let a lot of people know that he had a lot of forces and persons behind him.  But I don't think the emphasis is enough, back on the local and the, the level where it can be rooted in the people.  Even in Job Corps, we had little fake mock marches and they had their dialogues of this and that.  We carried it back there.  Some of the churches didn't entertain it.  And I, I do feel that a lot of the groundwork that was laid, it didn't filter enough into places where persons could really say, this is what we're about, you know.  To me, when I remember the--the dream to me is how Rosa Parks carried out, they carried out the bus, no fighting or anything.  They just decided, we will not ride the bus.  And that speaks more than anything, especially when your money is folded back.  Too much is perpetrated on violence or I'm gonna have this and that.  And I don't--I still don't think that is the way, although there were a lot of violent acts committed to our people for the wholes in Chicago [Illinois], and down South, and, and the other I'm reminded of when Reverend [Otis] Moss stated that his father walked eighteen miles to vote and had the door closed in his face.  Then I thought about this experience that the blacks went through 2000 in Dallas [Texas], of not being able to vote.  And, you know, the--and I worked in the booths.  I was a judge where you had to see--every paper was put here and there and there.  So to some degree, I think on the local level is where the force has to be strengthened more.  It's good to hear Rev. [Jesse] Jackson and--who's the other--Rev. [Joseph] Lowery and all of those men--and, and, they're--it, it's encouragement.  But we've got to take that and eat it, you know, quit just passing it, you know, on to the--we've got to do it.
Speaker 1: So there are diverse opinions within the black community--?
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) All over. And they're still there.
Speaker 1: When you mentioned Rev. Moss, that's Rev. Otis Moss?
Speaker 2: Yes, Rev. Otis Moss, pastor of Olivet Institutional Baptist Church.  He is a civil rights person because he worked with Dr. King and the pastor before him, Reverend [Odie] Hoover, who was in Tennessee.  These were men who actually worked with him, knew him personally and walked with him.  And I think his daughter, Carol Hoover, who was here in Cleveland--is she still here?
Speaker 1: (simultaneously) I'm not sure.
Speaker 2: I'm not either, but she spearheaded a large march in Tennessee on the college campus, you know.
Story_ID: 14618
Speaker 1: And I dare say that's one of the things that the blacks really need to concentrate on, the saving of our black schools.  And Booker Tall said it, Dr. Booker Tall, and I loved him.  He's gone.  He says, "It's one thing that the black schools do really, they don't tell you what to think about, but they teach you how to think about what you're wanting as the forefront in your life."  It's one thing to say I want to be a mathematician.  But it's another thing to get incorporated in the work that leads to it.  And, yes, I think we're still in a school of learning because, when I even hear the contemporary music.  I listen--I like looking at Dottie Peoples sometimes and Donnie McClurkin and all of those.  I listen, and then I agree sometime with Kirk Franklin when he said that his type music isn't for everyone.  It's like even in the jazz era, I never cared for the lowdown, gut blues.  But when the jazz came along, I liked that era cause it had the swinging tempo and the large bands would come to Cleveland [Ohio], and we could all go to the public auditorium and they could dance--this was clean, good fun back in then, the jitterbug and all of those things.  So I think when we look at gospel music, the new music has come in to--for the young people to know, your age and your sons and mine, that they are a part of the church era too.  They don't have to sing that 'Mount Zion Rejoice'.  They don't have to sing--.
Story_ID: 14619
Speaker 1: If I could just recap for a minute.  We had started to talk about the Civil Rights Era in Cleveland [Ohio].  And your comments suggested to me that there was some reluctance on the part of some religious leaders to be actively involved in the kind of protest that Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] was leading.  But the 1963 March on Washington [D.C.] was important for a lot--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) I think it, I think it really brought it to the forefront that the people said, "Those of us who really know what this man is talking about, we're gonna sacrifice and make this trip."  There were a lot of buses that went from Cleveland, all parts of the United States.  I think it was the most beautiful, to me, worship form of saying, we are here.  Our faces mean something here.  And it reminds me of the time when Marian Anderson had to stand outside and sing in front of Abraham Lincoln's statue [Lincoln Memorial, Washington, D.C.] because the DAR [Daughters of the American Revolution] would not let her sing in the Revolution Hall.  We have to always go beyond to prove a point.  I remember when Cleveland had the Future Outlook League.  And John O. Holly was head of it.  And they had to picket to get blacks in Ohio Bell [telephone company] and picket to get blacks working at the Cleveland Trust Bank and picket to get--the very stores where people would trade, A&P, and Fisher Brothers store, grocery store.  And right up there at 55th [Street] and Woodland was like, it was like a community gathering.  There was a big Sohio [formerly Standard Oil] up there.  There was the Chatterbox Club, the Horgenorth (ph.) and the Globe Theater, and there was the Hymie's Meat Market, who helped to sponsor Mary Holt (ph.).  There was a Cleveland Trust on the bank, Woolworth's store, and yet, these communities, they didn't want to hire black.  And they were spending their money there.  So then, they adopted the slogan, 'don't trade where you can't work'.  And I knew the Future Outlook League quite well because some of its leaders were members of Mount Sinai Church.  And a couple of times, the Future Outlook League had their meetings in our home on East 59th Street where my aunt, who's on that picture, was a member.  And one of the men, Mr. Milton Lewis, they had then what they called--the, the Laundromat was on wheels 'cause a lot of persons lived in apartments, and they couldn't wash clothes.  So they had what they called the wet wash.  And they would come and pick up your clothes and, and wet wash them.  And they'd bring 'em back to you and you could hang them different places till they dry.  Now, if you had them to dry it, you know, it was more money.  And this was a organization that did a lot of things to let blacks know they were important.  And when they picket that A&P, they told anybody, if you go in there and buy any food and come past this line, your food was gonna be on that ground.  And I loved John O. Holly for that.  He wasn't a great, big tall man.  And he wrote a book, 'The Future is Yours'.  And I think I have a copy of that, but he said, "Now, I mean we're gonna go down there"--and see the church being the bulwark of the black society.  They knew if these men came to the church and talked, this would rouse the people up.  And he say, "We gonna march next week.  Now, I want all of you all down"--and the people would do it.  They supported him.
Story_ID: 14620
Speaker 1: So I hear you saying that it's true that there were protests and demonstrations in the 1960s,--?
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) Yes.
Speaker 1: --But in Cleveland also in an earlier period?
Speaker 2: In the earlier period, in the, in the late '30s [1930s] and early '40s [1940s] we had those kind of, of awakenings, and I think it was awakening to what was going to come.  There always has to be a forward, you know.  And the Future Outlook League would meet every Wednesday night at the Woodland Library, and they would do things.  And then they had a different person in the neighborhood.  There was a man called Mr. Jimmy.  I never knew anything else but that.  He had a shoeshine place on Quincy near 59th.  He cleaned and blocked hats cause my mother had her done, black hats, but it was mostly men.  Every Christmas, mother--he would go to this building--it's a postal building now.  But it was this large brick building next to Will's Funeral Home where it is now.  And he would give out baskets of food and things for Christmas.  And this wasn't a big CIO-AF of L  [AFL-CIO, American Federation of Labor and the Congress of Industrial Organizations] organization.  This is just one man who came with his little buddies cause they had their little, you know, they had their little underworld things going on.  And people knew that.  So Christmastime, they'd come out and give people food and oranges and--and that made the people appreciate them.
Speaker 1: So there was an underground economy going--?
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) Sure it was a underground economy going back then.  It better be.  It had better been.  How you think the people could survive?  The numbers racket was really in bloom.
Speaker 1: Is that just in Cleveland [Ohio] or in other places as well?
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) No, a lot of places, Chicago [Illinois], all over, where you have a influx of black people, and they put, they play those little numbers.  And it was a little sheet with numbers down on it.  And the people would play it.  And you're saying to the man, I'm gonna play these numbers.  And when the man call--it's like an undercover bingo, but it had money with it.  And if the people would win, sometimes they'd win seventy-five cents.  Sometimes they'd win five dollars.  Well, my goodness people needed that money.
Story_ID: 14621
Speaker 1: So all of what you've said to me in the last few minutes suggest that there was a certain kind of struggle associated with surviving--?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: In Cleveland [Ohio]?
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) Right.
Speaker 1: And when I think about, especially the 1960s Civil Rights Era, there was a certain kind of music associated--
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) Yes, yes--.
Speaker 1: --with that struggle.
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) Yes, yeah, there was a music (singing) "Freedom, freedom, oh, freedom."  And they did sing songs.  One of the groups that brought this music out was Honey in the Rock--.
Speaker 1: Sweet Honey in the Rock?
Speaker 2: Yes, they sang a lot of freedom music.  I like the words to a lot of their songs, and those women were really some troopers.  I read recently where their leader retired, and we do get to that.  But they did that--another group that sang forcefully, freedom songs was--the Staples Singers, Mavis and her father [Roebuck "Pops" Staples].  When they sang--Aretha Franklin had "just a little respect" ['Respect'].  They, they had 'Respect Yourself,' (sings) all of these songs were words to the youth.  And they thrived on that.  Even this girl, the poetry woman, what is it, Nikki Giovanni?
Speaker 1: Nikki Giovanni.
Speaker 2: Yeah, she wrote poetry that they could relate to, and I thought all of this helped to bring the young people up into, to say, we are part of whatever movement, the youth are in it too.
Story_ID: 14622
Speaker 1: All right, now, as we finished up the last segment, you were talking about this revolutionary poetry of Nikki Giovanni and the marriage of words and music, and how it, it helped to, to encourage people in this time of tremendous change?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) And the written word through Maya Angelou has really been a asset because these people--I read her life story.  And I heard it, how she moved to Africa and she had to leave.  It seems like in, in the forefront of all of our struggles, the woman has been the head.  Wonder why is that?  Is that because Africa is the motherland?  I'm asking you now.
Speaker 1: Wow, this is your story.  You want my opinion, though on tape?
Speaker 2: (Laughs) Yes.
Speaker 1: Well,  I, I guess see it more as men and women working together, in different capacities but as, as co-workers in the same struggle.  That's just my interpretation.  Do you see it differently?
Speaker 2: I, I think and when I look at a lot of writers, and I've read a lot of works by James Baldwin and others, but it seems like right through in here, the women are more prominent in their works of writing.  I love reading Toni Morrison's books--although I've read Randall Robinson now, and who's the other man that I went to, oh, gosh--two or three.  And it seems like right here, the women are saying--the black women, we're at the crust of what we're doing.  You young people, you young men, pick this up and come on and go with it.  I think they've planted a good ground.
Story_ID: 14623
Speaker 1: If that's the case in literature, do you see that in music as well, especially gospel music?  Are women in the forefront in 2004?
Speaker 2: Now, let me see.  I know Margaret Douroux is doing a great work in California.  She's wanting to erect a building.  And I think right now, and I don't know--.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Margaret Douroux, composer or?
Speaker 2: Yes, she's a composer.  She's the one that wrote, that we sing, 'He Decided to Die', and oh, she's done a lot of things that--oh, 'If It Had Not Been For The Lord On My Side, Tell Me Where'--and those are her numbers.  And she did a great work with the James Cleveland Workshop [sic, Gospel Music Workshop of America, Inc.] of introducing her music and bringing it, you know, to fore, to forefront.  And I, I like her music because she writes more on the traditional level.  She, she does, and, and I like her for that.  And I'm trying to think. There's another woman who has written, oh, gosh, she's in the South.  She, she sort of reminds me of Lucy Campbell.  It'll come back to me later.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you say that women continue to be in the forefront of the, this movement to transform gospel music.
Speaker 2: Sure.  Look at the James Cleveland Workshop.  You've got two powerful women on the board there, Rodena Williams, Billy Preston--Billy Preston's sister, Rodena Preston-Williams.  She is a knockout on that.  And she plays everything.  And also there's Albertina Walker, working with the workshop.  She's over at the [Gospel] Announcers Guild [Division of the Gospel Music Workshop of America, Inc.] in James Cleveland.  And then you have Helen Stephens, who is responsible for bringing in a great, huge white choir from northern California.  And if you're standing outside the door, you'd think you're almost listening to black singers.  So the women--and then the brain behind the workshop yet is Sheila Smith, who was Ed Smith's wife.  Now, he ran that convention from his floral shop in Detroit [Michigan] 'cause that's where it started.  But she's picked it up and carrying the hymn going.
Speaker 1: And so this is the James Cleveland Gospel Music Workshop of America?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 14624
Speaker 1: Okay, if that's the current state of affairs then, where do we go from here?  Does the future look bright for gospel music, under the leadership of the folks whose names you've mentioned?
Speaker 2: I think, I, I think so.  I'd like to say that, but I--my concern right now is that I think some of the younger persons I've met in the middle twenties and thirties, I don't think they have the seriousness about it that we have.  And maybe because it was our livelihood.  It was our weekend, going here and our appointment to sing here.  And, are you going to so and so's program here?  And you got to touch it.  I remember on Sundays sometimes, I made two or three programs.  Maybe James--James Wade would be here and another choir would be there, and we'd walk in the door and sing a number.  And we'd go to another one, and they'd say, here comes Helen in there.  But, and maybe I didn't sing, but I was there.  We supported each other greatly.  It seems to me now, like it's getting to be too much of the stardom--.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) So artists are competing with each other or?
Speaker 2: Yes, and then too, it's, it's like, it's almost like they're just going to a regular program.  And I don't want to say that because I don't anyone to fight back at me, but I see this some time, is that the--I think the spirituality and the root that we had of dedication there has taken a new twist.  It doesn't seem to be like it is anymore.  Musicians are--some time they are not at one church, and the ministers have trouble hiring them.  And it, it's really more money than it is music.  And that's not that they shouldn't be paid.  Now, I'm one that feel the servant is worthy of his hire, pay him.
Speaker 1: Or her?
Speaker 2: Or her, that's right.  If it's three to five hundred dollars a Sunday or six, pay them.
Speaker 1: Do you--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) But I think they should be a more--the music department should be a more integral, spiritual part of the church.  It should never get to be an entertainment sector in the church.
Story_ID: 14625
Speaker 1: Okay, on that note, I'm gonna ask if you could play and sing for us some of that traditional gospel music that's made you a legend in this city [Cleveland, Ohio].  Would you do that?
Speaker 2: Well, let me see, is this cord long enough?
Speaker 1: Oh, no, we'll pause and maybe switch things around a little.
Speaker 2: (Tape interrruption).
Speaker 1: One number that really speaks to Kenneth Morris, a verse and a chorus, ' [My God is Real] Yes, God is Real'.  I'm not gonna sing it though.  You asked me to sing it. Then I have to change the key if I'm gonna sing it.  That's another thing that put gospel musicians over.  If you can transpose and play in any key, you can make it.  (Singing) "There are some things"--anybody sing it with me?--"I may not know, There are some places, I can't go; But I am sure, Of this one thing; That God is real, for I can feel Him deep within.  Oh, yes, God is real, He's real in my soul; Yes, God is real, For He has watched and made me whole.  His love for me, Is like pure gold; Yes, God is real, for I can feel Him in my soul."  And then the one that [Dr. Thomas A.] Dorsey wrote on ['The Lord Will Make A Way Somehow']--(Singing) "The Lord will make a way somehow, when beneath the cross I bow, He will take away the sorrow, let Him have your burdens now; When your load gets down so heavy the weight is sure to short upon my brow, There's a sweet relief, There's a sweet relief, There's a sweet relief in knowing the Lord will make a way somehow."  Now, I'm gonna do my mother's song.  She wrote this song, when she started walking again.  Mother [Henrietta Coleman] did not walk from 1940, no, '43 [1943] to '47 [1947].  She had a nervous breakdown 'cause she worked too hard.  So when she started working again, she wrote this song ['There Is A Place On The Battlefield For Me'].  (Singing) "There is a place on the battlefield for me; There's a place on the battlefield for me; I can hear Jesus' voice sweetly saying, Stand up for right and behold the victory.  On the battlefield Lord Jesus Christ was wounded; There He shed blood and died in agony; Now with joy, I'm fighting sin for my salvation, For His life means eternal life for me.  I love to fight for my Christ, I want to die fully right, Then I'll see my savior's face in peace; So I'll keep marching along, Joyfully singing my song; There's a place on the battlefield for me."
Speaker 2: (Applause)
