 Gill. Today is October 17, 2008. I   m visiting with  Patrice Latimer, a recent honorary at the Black Alumni Association  Honors Banquet tonight in the Alumni Center on the Oklahoma State  University campus. This is interview is for the O-STATE Stories Project  of the Oklahoma Oral History Research Program. Patrice,  congratulations, first of all.  Well thank you, Jerry.  Now I should back up and ask you, how did your golf game go today?  My golf game was obviously fabulous  We got a first place trophy.  Did you?  So OSU must be good for my golf game.  You came and skinned the old guys?  Yeah. (Laughter)  You might not get invited again   Well, surely that   s not true. Surely that   s not true. (Laughter)  That   s great. Congratulations. How has everything else been in town  after that?  Well, actually it   s been a great trip.  Well it   s good to have you back. I had the opportunity to observe the  awards recognition just previous to our interview here and it   s great to  5  Latimer  Gill  Latimer  have you back, Patrice. You   re remembered well by a lot of people. You  know Kent Sampson, we talked to him earlier, and just people over the  years remember your time here. Just wanted to ask you a couple of  questions.  First of all, you   re the first African American to be the SGA   Student  Government Association   President of Oklahoma State University. Is  this special to you? Has this been something in your life, a special  accomplishment that you look back at?  Of course it has. There were many things special about it; of course, it  was an honor to serve in that position. It was also an honor to serve in  that position as the first African American woman. But mostly it was the  opportunity to help to create or improve communication between  students and communication between students and the administration.  So, those were all the benefits and the joys of that experience. After that,  I have to say that the experience is one that gave me, I guess the courage  to take on some things that I might not have taken on had I not been able  to grow here at OSU and get comfortable with interacting with people  that were my peers as well as people who had higher positions of  responsibility at the university. So I believe that the experience has  served me well.  Patrice, being a candidate, we visited in my alumni association and for  a lot of our African American students on campus, particularly in the  early    50s and    60s, the early pioneers, it wasn   t always a great  experience for them. Looking back they   re still close to their Alma  Mater, but certainly for you maybe there was a little bit of transition of  accepting more African American students on campus, but still that is  quite a milestone to have gone from say, the    50   s, early    60s to just ten  years later, I believe it was    72-   73, you were the president of the  Student Government Association. Did that say a lot to you about  acceptance and the more open and welcoming Oklahoma State  University?  Yes and no. It did. Yes, because it was a group of students who were not  necessarily African Americans, certainly many of them were. As many  of them were not who supported me in the effort to become student body  president and who supported me during the term that I served. There  were students who were not African American who are the reason that  the idea was born and from that they, through their energy and time and  effort, reached out and brought in a broader group of students to  participate. They also were aware that it was a very new and different  thing, were somewhat skeptical of their ability to make that work in the  environment that we believed existed at OSU at that time. So when I  think back on it, we did do a lot of things to, in some ways, to conceal  6  Gill  Latimer  two things   that I was black and that I was female. I think that if you go  back and look at   though the university was not doing a project like this  at the time   but if you look at the student news paper you probably  won   t see any pictures of me. You will see pictures of a St. Bernard that  wore a shirt that said,    Latimer-McCurdy For A Change.    (Laughs) You  will possibly see articles where my name is printed as Leron Latimer as  opposed to Patrice Latimer because it was believed that that would  conceal the fact that I was female. So, there was a lot that went into  doing what people thought was necessary to get me elected because  what was important was an opportunity to do things differently.  If you think back on that time, I don   t want to trivialize our current  political race, nor do I want to trivialize the experience at OSU, but if  you look back at that, we were in somewhat of a similar time. As I just  said   our slogan was    Latimer-McCurdy For A Change    and it   s kind  of interesting that we are looking at that now. At that time we were in  the Vietnam War and students were being drafted to serve in that war  and there were organizations that were a part of the Student Association  whose mission was to help students to avoid the draft. So we were  looking at some very similar kinds of things and we were also looking at  a population that may be embracing, for the first time, an African  American as its leader and that, I think, was a very significant time in all  of our lives. I believe that it was though, no matter what we did, or  thought we had to do   cause we   ll never know whether that was really  necessary   it might be that I could have been on the front page of the  student newspaper every other day and talked about our ideas and our  platform and would have still been elected or I might not have, we   ll  never know. But what we do know is that having run a successful  campaign and having served in the office that we were able to, after the  fact, make some progress in terms of getting students to be more  interactive with each other and I think that   s what is important and I  think those beginnings maybe in some sense was a beginning of our, in  the broader society, people starting to create different kinds of  relationships and different ways of relating than had been exercised and  acceptable before.  You talked about your platforms. Do you remember some of your  platforms? What your issues that you ran on?  That   s a very difficult one. I know it was real important to change and  one of the things that it was important to change was a tradition of Greek  occupation of the office of student body president. I think if you look at  history after that, we started to have people who were active in the  Residence Hall Association or the residence halls themselves and the  residence halls did have an association, but to become more involved  with the Student Government Association and ultimately start running  7  Gill  Latimer  Gill  for that position. It became less of a position that was at least perceived  to be reserved for those who were members of the larger fraternities on  campus. I know that was one of our objectives and I believe we  accomplished that by Gary and I holding the office, because neither of  us were affiliated with a fraternity or sorority at that time. I joined a  sorority a couple of years later, but prior to that I had not been in and I  don   t think Gary McCurdy was ever affiliated with a fraternity. So that  was another thing that students, at least those that were supportive of the  campaign, embraced about it, and was one of the things that they felt  like was a significant change.  There was also the support for the ending of the draft. I remember that  was something we wanted to make sure the Student Government  Association was involved in because we thought it was a situation that  put our own at risk and so it stepped up in that way. I think again, not  wanting to trivialize the country   s presidential election, but we see  young people who are facing the same call to serve the country that has  been going on for a period of time where we have lost many young  people and looking at whether that is the policy that we should consider.  As a result of that, we have more young people involved this presidential  election than any that I can remember, even all the way back to  President Kennedy. There is, no matter who one supports in this  election, it is an energy that is familiar and I think that is what is  important.  That was the era of the late    60s and early    70s on our campus, and for  OSU, we   re pretty conservative. Do you remember some of the protests,  some of the activities, some of the speakers from the time you were here?  Some of the anti-war, against the administration   there   s a whole slew  of things going on. Can you remember some of the speakers we had on  campus or activities that we had on campus around those issues?  I don   t know that my memory is clear enough to recall them specifically,  but I do remember that OSU had a very active organization known as the  Speaker   s Bureau. The Speaker   s Bureau brought in many people to  speak who spoke about things that probably, at least from my  perspective, that I was not aware of and that I don   t think I would have  been informed about in any other part of my education. Not that there  weren   t relevant things, I just think that they were people that would not  have been brought into the classroom. But I can   t say that I specifically  remember people who were here on campus.  Who were some administrators that you remember on campus at that  time, people who you worked with? I want to get back to professors next  and talk about your academic side.  8  Latimer  Gill  Latimer  Gill  Latimer  Gill  Latimer  Gill  Latimer  Academic side? (Laughter)  Well right now in terms of your activities, the Residence Hall  Association and the student life and you being deemed as President. The  administrators that you had a relationship with that you recall that  stood out in your life.  Wow, the people that stood out in my life, and I can   t say that they were  necessarily administrators but they certainly were officials of Oklahoma  State University. I remember the head resident of Willham North I  believe was Susan Holland. She was of course was an administrator by  the time that I left, but she worked her way through the residence hall  process until she was an administration level person. Shaila Aery was  very important and stood out in my life when I was here as a student.  Norman Moore was the vice president that worked most directly with  the Student Government Association and was a personality with whom  we could have pleasant conflicts, with whom I could look to for those  kind of fatherly suggestions about how to get through and get to the end  of the university experience. Let me think who else. There was Dr.  Mitchell, there was Howard Ship, there was Dean   I believe he was  Dean of Student Affairs and his office was in the Student Union and I  want to say it started with an    s.    I think I said Howard Ship, Dr.  Mitchell. And then there was the Vice President of Academic Affairs  that Shaila worked for at one point. It   s not Kerr.  Pauline Kopecky?  No, it was a man. Had I had some time to reflect on this Jerry     Why don   t we turn the corner, we know your role at Oklahoma State.  Let   s talk about how you got to OSU. First of all about your family life,  how you grew up, where you were and how you got to Oklahoma State  University.  How I grew up. I grew up in Tulsa, Oklahoma. My parents were Elihue  and Jean Latimer. My father was a teacher in the Tulsa Public School  systems; my mother was a social worker for Tulsa County and then  became a recreational therapist at Hissm Memorial Center in Sand  Springs. I traveled in Up With People. My whole family was really  supportive of education. It was always there intent that their children  would be college educated, so not going to college was never an option  for me.  Did you have brothers and sisters?  I have a sister who is eight years younger than I am. So that really was a  9  Gill  Latimer  Gill  Latimer  Gill  Latimer  given, it was really interesting when I got to my senior year in high  school and people were talking about    What are you going to do next?     there as only one option, I was going to go to college. The only choice I  had was which college. That was following two years in Up With People  which, for a     Can you tell some us what that means? Some folks might not know what  that was...  Up With People was an international organization that did a two hour  musical performance, at OSU and just about every city and town in the  United States at some point, but it   I can   t really tell you specifically  what the purpose was, but we did a show of original songs and dances  that were intended to raise the spirits and to help us in an energetic way  move into our future. We focused a lot on space travel and on our  relationships with each other, the vastness of our world and the people  that make it up. So it had a lot of things that were going on that were to  help develop the individuals that participated in the cast. We traveled. I  was in the high school group which was relatively new as an  independent high school; before they  students  had done  correspondence study.  You actually graduated from Up With People High School?  Yes, I actually graduated from Up With People High School.  You took classes as you traveled around?  Yes, we had a faculty that traveled with us, a library that traveled with  us, and often we would go into a city and set up our school in a church.  A lot of it was independent study based, but a guided independent study.  And then we did the two hour musical show also, so we had the  responsibility of our studies and the show and the show was put on  completely by the members of that cast, which meant we had a lighting  crew, we had a sound crew that had to put up the stage and take down  the stage. We had an orchestra, and it was a very complex ordeal and  they had to be able to assemble that stage and the technology that it  required in very unpredictable environments. We would go from place to  place and sometimes we would perform in a high school gymnasium,  sometimes we would be in a local auditorium, you just never knew  where we might be.  So it was a growth experience, I have to say that. That growth  experience, I think, though there were times that I was resistant to it  because it was so new and so different than what I had been led to  believe I would be doing during my high school years and what the  10  Gill  Latimer  people whom I knew and were comfortable with were doing. We had  very different lives and I had to get used to having a very different life.  In that as we traveled we stayed in homes of citizens everywhere. I  would say our cast was made up of about a 120 people and of those 120  there may have been 10 African Americans. We stayed in the smallest of  towns in the Midwest and some of the largest cities in the nation, but  that meant because of the type of organization it was, all of those things  that may have made people uncomfortable, like those  volunteers  going  to keep somebody in their home, but didn   t know that it would be a  black student. Those kinds of things didn   t get addressed in advance and  I had to learn how to deal with them. Likewise, the host had to learn how  to deal with me. Those are all the kinds of experiences that have made it  such that we are able to live with each other, without judgment and in a  more cohesive way. So I think the more experience that we have in that  way, the less difference ultimately there will be between us at some  point.  Patrice, it   s obviously a different kind of experience, but the whole  experience of the opportunity to go to different places. What led you to  go Oklahoma State University?  That is the question you asked me initially. I did those two years and by  the end of the two years, I really was feeling like I wanted to go home, it  was a homesickness kind of thing. I was encouraged to explore other  universities and maybe go to other places. I remember I considered  Boston University and Princeton University and something on the west  coast and UCLA and wherever. But I really wanted to come home and I  did. I came back home because my dad had said,    I want you to go to  college. It   s up to you where you go. Whatever it costs, if I can do it  where I am now, I will do that. If I have to work three jobs, I will do  that. Where do you want to go?    And I chose Oklahoma State.  This is a growth experience and has been one of the more difficult  experiences in my life. When I decided to come to Oklahoma State, at  that time, Oklahoma State required all freshmen to stay on campus.  Because of having had the Up With People experience, I really didn   t  want to stay on campus, but I had a father who really was willing to do  whatever he could do to make sure I was happy. Unfortunately, he  decided to appease my desire not to stay in a dormitory and drove to  Oklahoma State to see if he could get me exempted from that rule in  some way and was in a fatal car accident on the way home. So, that was  a very difficult beginning to my experience at OSU.  However, in some way, and I think because of the way I was embraced  here, I made it through that. I was very supported by the residence hall  staff, and I think it was the residence hall staff that my father spoke with.  11  Gill  Latimer  Gill  Latimer  Gill  Latimer  Gill  They were very aware of the accident when I came and really worked  hard to take care of me and accommodate the fact that I had that  experience. It was only the year after that when I was elected student  body president. So I think that the Oklahoma State community did  something that made it possible for me to be okay here and to evolve  into more than just a student who was okay and trying to heal the  wounds of that loss.  Did you stay in the residence hall your second year?  I did not. As a matter of fact, I think that by the end of the year, I think it  was the last month   May   I just was determined to get out, and I was  allowed to move off campus with a cousin and some other friends. After  that I continued to have as many different experiences as a college  student as one could have, and we were    at that time, I lived in a  commune at one point and so we were just getting into co-ed dorms.  Then, the co-ed concept was that girls and boys live in the same  building, but separated. So to move from that and explore why girls and  boys couldn   t live in the same environment, to learn about that and learn  why people thought that had to be the rule, why it didn   t have to be the  rule, to learn the levels of the responsibility that it took if that wasn   t  going to be the rule, and in addition to responsibility, respect and regard  for each other. It was a way to learn that, and we did learn that, and the  people that I lived with became great friends and it wasn   t a,    You lived  in a commune  Was that a sexual thing?    And it wasn   t that at all  (Laughs) it was very funny. Did we all share beds at different times?  Yeah we did. People would come into a room and sit down and fall  asleep and be there, and yeah that   s where they were. But most of the  time we had on the dirty jeans that people that didn   t want us to wear  every day and the t-shirts that were fully dress and it was just fun. On  some level, I mean, looking back at it, it wasn   t the approved thing, but  there really wasn   t anything that was wrong, if you got back past the fact  that you had boys and girls in the same space. So it was good.  We were talking about the academic side when you laughed the first  time. What was your major?  My major was sociology.  Is that the time when we had the problems with a lot of the faculty  resigning?  I don   t think so.  Maybe it was a little bit after that.  12  Latimer  Gill  Latimer  Gill  Latimer  Yeah, I don   t think so.  Do you remember some of your professors? Anyone that influenced you  or not?  I want to say I remember a gentleman by the name, I think it was  Professor Perkins that taught The Little Prince. We read The Little  Prince (Laughter) and I can   t tell you today why we read The Little  Prince, nor can I tell you what The Little Prince was about. But I do  remember that probably the academic side, the formal academic side,  was not the thing I was most interested in at OSU. I think that I came out  with a fairly decent grade point average, but I don   t know that my  greatest interest was to pursue the knowledge that was available. But  there are many ways to get knowledge, and so I studied what I needed to  study to accomplish the purpose for being here and I practiced sociology  by mixing with as many types of people as I could. I think that is a thing  that Up With People did for me and OSU kind of took that to the next  level because I had more independence and more choice about the  relationships that I developed and there   s a lot of them.  The education opportunities outside of the classroom were probably as  important to your personal growth and your later career in life as...  Exactly. Exactly. But I did listen in some of the sociology classes and  learned   I think maybe conceptually the thing that I remember being  taught in a sociology class   I can   t tell you which one   and that I have  looked at several times, is how circular our experiences can be. Because  we learn what people teach us, then we tend to go in the circles of those  who taught us. It is less likely that you will go out of those circles. So  that   s why you have people who tell stories like    I   m the first person in  my family to go to college.    That   s a major change from the circle that  people have been able to share with them. Or if you talk about a circle of  wealthy people, or a circle of poor people, because we learn what we  have people around us to teach and that creates the circle.  So then I became very interested in how you move out of those circles  and one of the ways you move out of those circles is by broadening who  you let into the circle. You get new ideas. So that is something that I  think I can attribute the sociology experience to have caused me to  observe. And the next thing that I observed is that there is a connection  between sociology and economics. How we group ourselves has a lot to  do with economics. Education is a really important thing in making or  broadening those circles because if you have that, it makes it more likely  that you could move from the circle of poverty toward the circle of  wealth. So that   s a reason that it   s important and that is the reason that I  decided to study economics.  13  Gill  Latimer  Gill  Latimer  Gill  Latimer  Gill  Latimer  There was the dean of the School of Business, I think, where economics  was housed, who actually reached out and asked me to attend a summer  program that was at the University of California at Berkeley in 1974, I  think. That was a completely different eye opening experience. In that  experience, the program was led by a professor at Northwestern  University in Illinois and it was designed for black economics majors,  which I was not, but somebody here  OSU  believed enough in me that I  would benefit from that program. I was accepted, I attended, and there I  got to learn a lot about the historically black colleges and universities,  which I had not gotten a sense of here at Oklahoma State. During that  era, there was not a recognition of the richness of that history and not a  great amount of interaction between, say land grant institutions and  HBCUs, Historically Black Colleges and Universities, so that gave me a  whole different experience that really is all, from my perspective,  encapsulated in my Oklahoma State University experience.  The final question about Oklahoma State, did you have some favorite  hang outs on campus and off campus?  Well of course there was always Hideaway Pizza.  Was it still at the original location?  Yes, and down on the Strip. I was here in the crowd and I can remember  the event when we had the first episode of streakers. (Laughs) The  infamous streakers. I believe that the first Eskimo Joes was built in the  backyard of the commune that we lived in over at Knoblock and Elm, I  believe.  That used to be the Old Williams Sporting House.  Okay. We didn   t know that but we had great fun there. Let me see, other  hangouts. You know, the whole strip area was a place that tended to  draw people. There was always the Alpha Phi Alpha house. The Kappa  Alpha Phi fraternity also had a house where students gathered and had  parties on weekends and various things. I spent actually a lot of time at  the Zeta Phi Beta house, where I had a couple of great friends who  supported me as student body president and after that who were Zetas,  and so that was a place that I spent some time.  Were there places on campus that you   the library?  The Student Union. The Library? How could the Library be   ? Was that  anybody   s? (Laughs) Spent a lot of time in the Student Union. The  Black Student Association   is what it was called when I was here   had  an office in the Student Union and I spent some time there. So, let me  14  Gill  Latimer  Gill  Latimer  Gill  think     Why did you run for Student Government Association president? What  was your motivation?  Probably the notion that it couldn   t be done, in addition to the belief that  we could come together to address things that were a part of our  common experience. I guess going back to that experience at Oklahoma  State and my experience in Up With People, I have to believe that there  is a connection in that.  You heard some of the comments tonight at the Black Alumni  Association meeting. What was your opinion on the atmosphere for  African Americans in the early    70s, was it more or less inviting from  what you hear of the other stories? Or what were your feelings?  I would have to say that it was less inviting then than it is now. But I  don   t know that that is a   when I make that observation it certainly is  not intended to be a blight or a slight to Oklahoma State University. I  believe that everybody the best that they knew how to do at that  particular time. The way we change, I think, is a part of the process of  learning a better way to do things. While here  OSU , I got the sense  from the students that I talked to tonight that they felt included, they felt  valued, they felt embraced by the community and by a body of people  who have gone before them, who care enough to come back and support  them in the process of moving through the university experience.  But a lot of things have changed. A lot of these students have attended  public schools in integrated environments. I didn   t attend an integrated  school until I went to Up With People. That was a very big change and  so being comfortable here, I   m sure is easier for students who have had a  broader experience  prior to college  than I had. It may have been  difficult for this institution to take full responsibility for making us  comfortable without creating separate societies, so it may have been  something that we had to grow through. I believe that becoming active  in organizations like the Student Government Association and Residence  Hall Associations and sororities and fraternities   of the major sororities  and fraternities on campus, I don   t know that those entities were  integrated. At this point, I don   t know whether they are today. I hope  that they are. That, I think, is another indication of progress, an  indication of how far we   ve come in learning to live in and amongst  each other. Because the truth is, we all are seeking the same thing which  I would say, is love.  Who   s the Patrice Latimer that we have not seen for the last 38 years?  Can you hit some highlights from when you left Oklahoma State  15  Latimer  Gill  Latimer  Gill  Latimer  University where your life has led you?  Wow. My life has led me into the mode of most lives of how we survive  and do the things that we believe are important. The first thing is to feed  thy self. (Laughs)  That   s the economics part.  (Laughs) Yeah it   s the economics part of it. So when I left Oklahoma  State University I went to work for Cargill. I didn   t have any idea who  Cargill was or what that company did. But I got my job through the  University   s job posting and recruitment process, so that worked well for  me. I went to work for Cargill  commodity merchant , stayed there for  two years, which was long enough for me to figure out that I needed to  earn more than I was likely to earn with my bachelor   s degree, so that  created an opportunity for additional education. I came back here and I  tried my hand at being a graduate student and went to the College of  Business. It was my intent to pursue an M.B.A., however there were lots  of holes to fill from my sociology background. (Laughs) I found out that  I got kind of stuck on calculus and statistics. That caused me to think     Hmm   maybe I better find another degree to pursue.    That   s the point  at which I decided to go to law school.  So you were back about a semester here?  Yes, I was a semester here. Then I went to OU because, unfortunately,  Oklahoma State didn   t have a law program. So I went to OU and that  was an academic experience as opposed to a social growth experience.  My experience at Oklahoma State was much more fun. So Oklahoma  State is my school of preference, but that was good. Following law  school   actually while I was in law school, because in order to do  that   let me just step back a moment. As I told you, my mother, who  took a responsibility getting me through Oklahoma State   I had a sister  behind, so going to law school was my responsibility.  I worked full time at a D.A.   s office there, so when I graduated I went to  the Oklahoma County D.A.   s office and then to the U.S. Attorney   s  office for the Eastern District of Oklahoma  Muskogee . Following that I  tried my hand at private practice, learned a lot about people. Learned  mostly that when you represent individuals, legal problems are usually  symptomatic of other things and the legal problem is the tip of the  iceberg. What I learned as a probably 27-year old person who came from  a very protected environment, although there were a all the things that  we talked about, I was raised in a home that was very protective. I came  to Oklahoma State and was in an environment that was less protective  than my immediate family, but still protective. Then I went to practice  16  Gill  Latimer  Gill  Latimer  law and hung out a shingle and invited the whole world in and I learned  a lot of things that made me scratch my head. Many of them I couldn   t  figure out at the time, but I did figure out that many of them I really  didn   t want to figure out. (Laughs)  I decided that I wanted to practice a different kind of law and being  candid about that time, the options for a black female attorney were not  what they are now. I have to say that Ada Lois Sipuel Fisher is the  woman who made it possible for me to attend the University of  Oklahoma College of Law, but that   s because she fought the system to  the U.S. Supreme Court twice for me  and others like me  to be able to  go and sit amongst the rest of the students and get a legal education in  the state of Oklahoma. So it   s been   I stand on the shoulders of people  that did things that were a lot more noble than anything that I have done  in order for me to be able to have the experiences that I   ve had today.  I   m very grateful for those people. But, again, it   s a growth process, and  while it   s not a pretty picture and it probably was something that Ms.  Fisher would prefer that she hadn   t had to go through, it did serve a  purpose and while it may not have served her in the way that she wanted  it to, I hope that she was proud that it served many others. So that was a  good thing.  I elected to move to Washington because I felt that in that environment I  could have a broader legal experience than what I would be allowed to  have here  Oklahoma . And I   ve done that, but Oklahoma has changed a  lot and I have been there  Washington, D.C.  for 20 years. I   ve had that  career and I am now realizing though that I moved to a community  where I was not known and that was very different because in Tulsa,  Oklahoma, I   m from a family that is large and that is known. When I  came to Oklahoma State it became a community in which I was known.  Then I went to Washington and I wasn   t known. This is why it is such a  comforting love-filled experience to return to OSU for this purpose and  you will see me more often.  There   s a cryptic note about you   ve changed to a different calling at the  end of your biography.  (Laughs) Oh     To experience life differently.    Well, yes I am willing to  talk about that, because I think that I have accomplished some things  that I am proud of, but I think I have come to a place where many of  those things are not what fulfill me. I would like to look for what that is  and have the opportunity to experience that.  Don   t know what it is yet?  I   m open to it and I   m open to just about anything anywhere. I have to  17  Gill  Latimer  Gill  say I am an experiencing an international kind of calling because one  day I just woke up and realized that the world is a very big place with a  lot of very different people in it. I mean when we are here, I think my  world looked like trying to bring these worlds of those of us of African  descent and those of us of European descent who call ourselves  Americans, together, and that   s where the focus was. I moved to  Washington and realized there are those of us, and there are people who  come from other places all over the world, and then there are a whole  group of religions that divide us. You know, when I was here   and I  know that there   s a variety of religions represented in Oklahoma, but I  was aware of the Protestants and the Catholics and that was kind of it.  So to know and be familiar with Jewish people and just the whole  variety of Buddhist people and other religious beliefs that are out there  and realize that there is many paths, but all towards one God that may  have different names and those kind of things, but again we   re not as  different as those labels seem to cause us to perceive ourselves to be.  Final question. I   ll let you get to the Walk Around. Favorite OSU  memory or memories, looking back?  Favorite OSU memory or memories. Well I guess I would have to say  next to being the first African American Student Body President, what I  remember after that? That really was a highlight in my life here at OSU.  I would say since we are here for Homecoming, that OSU football was  one of my favorite gatherings. As a matter of fact, I have said many  times that I was at the University of Oklahoma when the University of  Oklahoma was the top of its game in football. I attended two games and  decided very readily that there was nothing like being at an OSU  football game. One reason is, though we would have liked to have won,  it didn   t matter. And at OU, it mattered a little bit too much what the  outcome of the game was and if the game didn   t have a good outcome  then the experience of the game wasn   t much fun. At OSU, regardless of  the outcome, the experience of the game was always fun. It was better  because victory was sweet when we did win, but we had a great time in  the stands and watching our friends play and it was that I think was  probably my favorite university-sponsored event that happened over and  over again.  Patrice I   m going to close this. If you allow me to quote you, that about     Connections for life and going to football games and being together  and the Student Government Association, and that the connections  you   ve made have been for a life time.    I appreciate your comment that  you wanted to strengthen those connections with Oklahoma State  University. So I wanted to say thank you and congratulations on your  career. We   re proud of you and we hope that you stay connected for life.  18  Latimer  Gill  Latimer  Okay, I will.  Thanks a lot.  Thank you, Jerry.  -------  -------
