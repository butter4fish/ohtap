 Larson  Arnold  Today is December 10, 2009. My name is Mary Larson. We   re here with  Dr. Harvey Arnold who has kindly come in today from Atoka. We are at  the veterinary med school library in McElroy Hall, and we also have  here with us Dr. Sidney Ewing and Alene Arnold, Dr. Harvey Arnold   s  wife. Before we get started talking about our main topic here, I   d like to  get just a little bit of biographical information from you, first, if I could.  Could you tell me a little bit about where you were born and raised and  maybe something about your family?  I was born and raised in southeastern Atoka County, and I   m the oldest  of four children. I   ve got three sisters younger than myself. I would  describe my dad as a rancher. When I was young, he did a little bit of  farming, and then he almost got away from that and just raised cattle,  swine, and horses. When I was in vocational agriculture, my vo-ag  teacher said,    What we need in Atoka is a veterinarian.    I think that   s  one of the things that prompted me to go to vet school. I thought a lot of  my ag instructor. Later on, one of his sons became a veterinarian.  So, he felt strongly about that.  Yes. Well, I wanted to be able to remain on the farm, and I thought that  one way to do that was to have an income that didn   t have to be derived  solely from doing the farming myself. I knew that you could survive, but  that was about the extent of it, the way I had it concluded.  So, how did you end up at Oklahoma A M?  I just concluded, at the time, I knew that you could go to, well, I call  them junior colleges. You could go and get your two years pre-vet at  some other location, but in my own mind, I thought,    Well, the vet  school is at Stillwater, and maybe it   d be better if I just get my pre-vet at  Stillwater.    So, that   s where I came to get my pre-vet. Of course, what I  5  Larson  Arnold  Larson  Arnold  Larson  Arnold  Larson  Arnold  Larson  Arnold  did   either I didn   t understand, or my advisor didn   t understand, and  whenever I applied to vet school, I called them about    When do I  report?    and they said,    Well, sorry about that, but you haven   t been  accepted.    So, I said,    Well, I don   t understand.    I believe I came up  here, ready to go to vet school, and they said,    We   re sorry about that,  but you didn   t get accepted.    I said,    Well, I don   t understand. Why not?  Why didn   t I get notified?    They said,    Well, you had three prerequisites  that you didn   t take.    One of them seemed to be mathematics, and I  don   t remember the other two. But in those days, I didn   t have a lot of  money, and I thought,    Well, I can   t afford to go to school again to get  these nine hours.    So, while I was on campus, I enrolled in three  extension courses. I went to West Texas and worked on the railroad and  finished my nine hours and applied the following year and got in.  What year did you start?  I graduated in    57, so I would   ve started in    52, I guess. Would it have  been    53? I got my first two years in, started in    50. I went    50 and    51; I  dropped out for a year. Took those nine hours of correspondence, then  went to vet school and graduated in    57.  When you were here at the vet school, that was rather early on in its  history.  Yes. I understand the first graduates were in 1951.  So, what was it like being here at that time?  Well, I had nothing to compare it with. (Laughter) You know, it was  tough, academically. I knew that I didn   t want to flunk out. I had to  work, so I worked and studied so that I   d be able to make it.  What were the facilities like? I mean, was it mainly     We had an old Quonset hut where we did anatomy, and then in the other  end of it, we had the physiology and pathology, we had, where we did  things like that. We had microscopes, and most of them were old. I think  you   d call them Army barracks; they were wooden structures that were  here at the time. They were to the east of us up the street, on the south  side of the road.  As part of your training during vet school, were you involved in working  outside the university on any outbreaks or anything like that?  Not during school. You know, in school, the only outside involvement  was that when we had large animal clinics where we would go with the  6  Larson  Arnold  Larson  Arnold  Larson  Arnold  Larson  Arnold  instructor, four to six of us, go out and make farm calls. That   s the only  thing I was involved in.  You graduated in    57, and what did you do after that? Did you stay here  in Stillwater? Did you go back to Atoka?  I went back to Atoka. We had thirty-two people that graduated in our  class, and during that time, at least sixteen of us had been deferred from  military. When we graduated, then we were responsible to our draft  boards. I know in my case, I went to my draft board after I graduated  and said,    Well, I   ve been deferred. Here I am. Where do we go from  here?    And they said,    Well, the Army doesn   t need veterinarians.  However, the United States Department of Agriculture does need  veterinarians, and we would suggest that you look into fulfilling your  military duties by working for Uncle Sam, for the USDA.    I did that.  Like Dr. Brisco that   s coming later, he did that. There was sixteen, half  of that graduating class, that went to work for the USDA. Not all of  them worked in Oklahoma, but several did. And then the other half in  our class   we had some that I   ll call veterans that had already been in  the military and came back and was on the GI Bill in our class. And then  there was probably about half a dozen that had took more military and  had had a commission. They went in as an officer, and I guess that  would make up the other sixteen. They were either military or they went  into the military as an officer. They had no choice. (Laughter) They had  to go, and the sixteen of us didn   t have to go, so we chose to go to work  for USDA.  Is that how you became involved in the 1957 anthrax outbreak?  Yes. I went back to Atoka, and since I wasn   t that close to Oklahoma  City, I know Dr. Brisco went to work before I did. I can   t speak for any  of the others, but the way I remember it and understand it is that either I  contacted Oklahoma City and said,    Okay, I   m ready to go to work,    or  they contacted me. I think I had an application in. So, I showed up at  Oklahoma City and did the paperwork, and, the way I remember it, I  was sent immediately to the anthrax outbreak up in Vinita.  Were you in the lab or in the field or both at this time?  I was in the field.  What do you remember about where that particular outbreak started?  Well, it was my understanding that maybe the center of it, most of the  deaths and the outbreak, was primarily around Vinita, or Craig County,  as I always think of it as Craig County. I had about two responsibilities  7  Larson  Arnold  Larson  Arnold  Larson  Arnold  Larson  Arnold  Larson  Arnold  that I remember. They were to vaccinate livestock and to do what we  call post mortem on the dead animals to see if it was anthrax or to  confirm that it was anthrax. We pretty well knew. You could see a dead  cow that had been bleeding from the nose and maybe from both ends  that you were dealing with anthrax. We did the minimum that we had to  in order to protect ourselves and protect the environment. We would cut  through the rib over the spleen, and we   d take a swab and cut through  the spleen and take some of that spleen content on that swab, put it in a  mailing tube in a glass vial and mail it in to the lab to confirm that it was  or was not anthrax.  So, you were opening up the animals as little as possible.  Yes, yes. And then after that was done, then it was the owner   s  responsibility to burn the animal.  My understanding is that anthrax basically attacks the spleen of the  animals. Is that true?  Well, yes, the spleen would be kind of degenerated. It would be kind of  like a jelly. It affects the whole body, but the spleen was one of the  better places to get our sample. I mean, we could   ve just took a blood  sample, but the spleen seemed to be the preferred tissue to send in.  So, most of the samples that went in would   ve been that sort of tissue?  That   s the only kind of samples that I know that was sent in.  Okay. Were you sampling just cattle, or were there other animal deaths?  I didn   t sample anything other than cattle. And then my second  responsibility   I mean, I had two: to take those samples from the dead  animals and to vaccinate the live healthy animals.  Did you have any facilities out in the field that you were using or a  headquarters of any sort, or were you just at individual farms most of  the time?  At Welch, Oklahoma, there was a new sale barn had been built, and they  hadn   t started using it, and there was another, an older federal  veterinarian, Dr. Krull, who was in charge of the crew. I mean, we were  there to work with and under Dr. Krull   s directions as young  veterinarians, and he used that, I   ll call it the sale barn offices. It wasn   t  being used, and they thought,    Well, okay, we   re interested in taking  care of livestock health, and what better use to put this facility to than to  use it as a headquarters for animal health    for APHIS  Animal and Plant  8  Larson  Arnold  Larson  Arnold  Larson  Arnold  Larson  Arnold  Health Inspection Service .  Were there safety concerns at the time, or just standard practice?  The safety concerns was don   t get exposed, and that   s why we did as  minimum as we could to get the sample. That   s all we wanted to do was  just get a sample, and, of course, we had boots and gloves and  disinfectant, disinfectant equipment. We had buckets and disinfectants,  water, brushes, to   you know, after we got close to one of these dead  animals then we disinfected our equipment. We had coveralls that we  wore to protect ourselves and protect others.  Could you explain a little bit for people that don   t understand why it   s  important to keep the animal as much of a closed system as possible?  Well, yes. Those anthrax bacteria, they get into the environment, so they  get into the ground and they form a spore which stays there, I don   t  know, fifty or a hundred years. This was what was happening up there,  is that   well, I   ll say it had been a wet spell. The man-made lakes and  natural lakes raised up and killed the vegetation around the edges of  those lakes, and then as that vegetation died and decayed, you had those  spores that lived in there, and the cattle or the other animals that would  come in to drink water from those lakes, either from the water or from  the mud around there, would get exposed to the anthrax spores that had  been there maybe from, I think it was speculated that these spores were  left there by the buffalo from years ago.  That was another question, actually, I had. Were these larger outbreaks  a relatively recent occurrence at that point in time, or had they been  going on earlier?  Yes, they hadn   t been going on very long. Once they had a few and they  diagnosed it, once it was sent in down here and it was diagnosed, then  they wanted to do the best they could to contain it, and the way to  contain it was to prevent any spread from new cases and to vaccinate all  animals that were in the area that could come in contact with the  organism.  Let   s talk a little bit about the vaccination process. What all did that  entail, and how did they define which areas were going to be targeted?  I think the best way, probably, to describe it is that if you had a dead  animal then you tried to vaccinate all animals that surrounded that, in a  concentric circle. If you had a dead animal, then you tried to contact all  of the neighbors that adjoined that premise and give them an opportunity  to vaccinate, and they were very cooperative, and most of them did take  9  Larson  Arnold  Larson  Arnold  Larson  Arnold  Larson  Arnold  advantage of vaccinating. In fact, most of us had a crew that went with  us, or we went with the crew to go to the different farms and vaccinate  the animals that they had. The major species that we vaccinated was  cattle. There was more cattle, but we also vaccinated horses, swine,  sheep and goats. I didn   t vaccinate any sheep and goats, but we would  have if they   d had them on the premise and wanted to vaccinate them,  and dogs. But the majority of it was cattle, and in that country we had  larger cattle herds than we do, say, in my part of the state. In  southeastern Oklahoma, cattle herds are much smaller than the average  cattle herd up there. You also had smaller cattle herds up there, and you  may have one person that would have only one cow to milk. So, we did  all sizes.  Were most of the farms up in northeastern Oklahoma dairy, or was it a  mix?  Primarily beef cattle. Ninety-nine percent, I   d say.  If vaccines had been available previously, were there reasons that  farmers weren   t getting vaccines? Were the outbreaks uncommon, or  were there risks, or was it a cost issue?  They were uncommon. The weather conditions had to be just right to  present the problem. The spores were there, but if the weather conditions  were not right to cause them to spread and infect animals, then it didn   t  happen. On very dry weather, you have a dry period, and the disease  basically went away. I mean, the spores were still there, but the animals  didn   t get sick.  What kind of vaccination was used?  I don   t remember. I believe it was a killed vaccine. I don   t think there  was any danger in the vaccine, in spreading it either to the people that  was doing the vaccinating or to the animals.  I just wasn   t sure what was available at that time. When you went in  with the crew to start vaccinating, say you went to a farm where there   d  been at least one case diagnosed, you mentioned going to the neighbors.  What would the actual on-the-ground operation look like?  One of the premises I was particularly impressed with, there was a  registered Brahma herd up there that had, I don   t recall the number, but  they had hundreds. And what I was impressed about   my experience  with Brahmas were that they were mean and wild and hard to handle,  but these people had those cattle trained. They   d take a truck, and they   d  bring in, we   ll say, a pasture of 100 head, and they   d follow that feed  10  Larson  Arnold  Larson  Arnold  Larson  Arnold  Larson  Arnold  Larson  truck, and the cowboys, two or three of them, would follow the cattle.  The feed truck would drive into the big corrals, or they built wings,  funnels, for them to get them into the corrals, and I was impressed with  how efficiently they handled those Brahma cattle. We put them in the  corral and then put them through the chute, and that   s where I vaccinated  them.  That could   ve been quite a trial.  Oh, yes. Yes, but they had lots of cattle. They had good equipment.  They had in those days maybe not the kind of money they have today,  but they had what they needed to do the job efficiently. And then you go  from that to where you   d go out to a person that had six head of cattle.  They hardly had a corral that could hold them, and you   d have to rope  the cows and tie them to a post or to a tree and then very carefully get up  there close enough so you could vaccinate the animal without getting  hurt. Usually if they had horses, the horses that they was riding, you   d  vaccinate those, or if they had other horses on the premises, they   d be  vaccinated. I vaccinated some dogs. I don   t know that we vaccinated all  dogs. I think some of them didn   t bother to worry about catching every  dog they had to get it vaccinated.  That   s a trick, too. Having mentioned that herd there, did you notice the  bulls? Someone had mentioned earlier that in some cases bulls tend to  be more affected than cows. Is that something that you had run into?  I don   t recall that I did any more post on bulls. In fact, I don   t remember  that I collected any samples on any dead bulls. I think they were all  females that I was associated with.  How many people would you have on one of these crews, or did it just  depend from day to day?  It depends from day to day. Two or three, maybe up to half a dozen or a  dozen. Like with these big people, the rancher may have half a dozen  cowboys themselves in addition to the help from the neighbors, and  that   s where most of the crew came from was neighbor helping  neighbor.  Because everybody had a vested interest in getting this controlled.  Yes, yes.  How many animals would you be able to vaccinate? Say, you had a  good day, like this Brahma herd.  11  Arnold  Larson  Arnold  Larson  Arnold  Larson  Arnold  Larson  Arnold  You can vaccinate them as fast as you could get them through the chute.  Like this Brahma herd, if they could gather enough of them, you could  do 300 or 400. Probably not more than that, but I   d say 300 or 400  would be a good day, because you had to get the cattle from the pasture  into the working facility, and the way I remember it, this Brahma herd  had portable facilities that they could move from one pasture to the  other.  Would   ve been nice if every place had been like that. (Laughter)  Oh, yes. That was an exception.  When did you start with the vaccination process? When did you first  become involved with that?  I really don   t remember. I   m going to say it was about July of 1957. I  believe I spent about three months over there.  I was wondering how long that went on. As far as the other people who  were working with you on the vaccination crews, who all would   ve been  involved? You had USDA folks, apparently.  Yes. The majority of them were USDA. We were close to the other  states up there, close to Kansas and Missouri, and some of the other  states sent some veterinarians in to assist. I don   t recall, but the state of  Oklahoma always had veterinarians, and the federal and the state people  worked together. So, if they had some state veterinarians available, they  could   ve and would   ve sent them up there, but I don   t remember that  there were any state veterinarians working up there.  Were there people from OSU that weren   t USDA that you recall that  were involved with that?  Well, not that I recall. I mean, the diagnostics was with OSU, but they  posted some, and I think possibly that might   ve been the way it first   I  don   t know how the sample got to OSU to be first diagnosed that we  were dealing with anthrax. And then the lab people at OSU would  receive the samples and confirm that it was or was not anthrax. This, to  us, was kind of an academic thing. With us, if the person had a dead  animal and it looked like anthrax, we didn   t wait for the lab, because  we   d have had to wait a week or ten days. We went ahead and  vaccinated whether it was or was not. Didn   t make any difference how  the sample turned out. We vaccinated because we knew that we was  within an area that there   s a good chance that it was anthrax without  having it confirmed by the lab.  12  Larson  Arnold  Larson  Arnold  Larson  Arnold  Larson  Arnold  Larson  Arnold  Larson  Arnold  I understand for the most part that mortality was pretty swift after onset  of symptoms. Were you involved in any treatment of animals that were  sick?  No, I did not see any sick animals, and I didn   t treat any sick animals.  The way most of it happened is, the owner ordinarily didn   t find them  sick. They just found them dead. They was in good shape yesterday; the  next day they were dead. And that   s the way most of it happened. I   m  sure that there were some, maybe, that found an animal that was sick and  observed them being sick before they died, but I didn   t see it, and I don   t  recall talking to an owner that found a sick animal that had died later.  I know in the last, even, few years, internationally you hear about  different zoonotic outbreaks where people have to put down part of their  herd. Was that something that was involved with this outbreak that you  know about?  No. The program was just to vaccinate to prevent the disease.  And since there was a vaccine, maybe it just wasn   t a necessary...  Right. It wasn   t like brucellosis, where it   s going to spread. I mean, if  the animal gets it, if it   s not treated, it   s going to die. And hopefully, it  wouldn   t have spread enough infected blood around that the other  animals would get a taste of it and die from that, and that was the  purpose of burning these animals promptly, to kill the   you know, you  can bury them, but all you   re doing if you bury them, then you   re going  to have those spores there for another fifty or a hundred years from that  buried animal.  Right. So, a good hot fire would take care of the spores.  Yes, and we didn   t supervise the fires. We recommended, and the  owners took care of that. And they knew that if they didn   t take care of it  safely, then they were the ones going to suffer. They   d have more  animals to die.  Right, because it   s their farm.  Yes. So, they were quite diligent in doing what they were recommended  to do.  You mentioned that the vaccination process took about three months.  Well, I mean, that   s how long I was there. I think others might   ve stayed  longer than I did.  13  Larson  Arnold  Larson  Arnold  Larson  Arnold  Larson  Arnold  Larson  Arnold  At what point did you stop seeing post mortems that you had to do, or  was that about the same length of time?  Yes. The deaths, I think, slowed down some, but we continued. I mean,  as long as I was there, we were continuing to have deaths.  Were you staying in Vinita, or did you move around? How did they  house all of you folks?  Well, we stayed in hotels and motels. Vinita   s the only place that I  remember that I stayed. I don   t remember any other location.  Once you got an animal vaccinated, about how long would it take before  the vaccine was effective?  I think maybe we told them five to seven days. I believe that was the  recommendation that was made.  I understand that there was also quarantining involved in this process.  Were you folks at all involved in the quarantine part of the equation, or  was that something that was left to other agencies?  No. I mean, the quarantine probably was more the state veterinarian   s  responsibility. We could   ve been involved with it, but I don   t remember  or recall being involved or that there was that much quarantining going  on. I don   t recall that they shut any sale barns down or told those people  that if you had a dead animal that you can   t sell them. The way I  remember it is that the quarantine wasn   t used much at that time.  Quarantining was, for me, more important with brucellosis and  tuberculosis and hog cholera and things like that. I don   t recall anything  on quarantining. It could   ve been that, well, I think in general, they  probably just left it to the livestock owners to do as they saw best. I  think that if they thought that there was any harm in moving animals,  they just kept them home, voluntarily.  My understanding, too, is that, at about the same time or before and  after the anthrax outbreak, there were a lot of cases of leptospirosis. Did  you run into any of that?  No. I mean, yes, there would   ve been lepto before and after, and  theoretically some of these deaths could   ve been lepto, but then I think  the lab tests would show if you was dealing with anthrax. I don   t know  that they tested for anything else, you know. They was interested in  whether it was caused by anthrax, and if it wasn   t caused by anthrax,  they was unconcerned about what the death cause was.  14  Larson  Arnold  Larson  Arnold  Larson  Arnold  Larson  Arnold  Larson  Arnold  Larson  Arnold  I guess I was just trying to figure out if it was a contributing factor as  far as affecting the immune systems of any animals, in advance of     I don   t think so.  Okay. And I haven   t been here long enough to know how common lepto  is in a standard summer in Oklahoma, anyway. You talked a little bit  about some of the conditions that were responsible for the outbreak, the  fact that it was a particularly wet summer, I guess.  It was a wet summer, and then it turned off dry. That left conditions for  those bacteria to, I   d say, either come out of the spore stage or maybe to  even reproduce in the decaying weeds and grass and mud, whatever.  Nutrients. There were certain nutrients. I mean, if they were going to  live and reproduce, they had to have nutrients to do that.  And that would be a good environment for that. From some of the  reading I   ve done, I know that humans can have three different forms.  There   s an inhalation form, a respiratory form, or a gastrointestinal  form. Is that the same in cattle, or is it not as differentiated?  I would say that it could be the same in cattle, but all that I ever saw and  all that I know the others seen, they didn   t see an animal that had a sore  on it like you could get. They just saw a general infection, an infection  of the whole body. An acute infection is what we were seeing.  As opposed to some sort of cutaneous...  Yes.  I just wondered if there was a way of telling if there was any sort of  diagnostic with animals to tell if they had gotten it through food and  water, or if it was inhaled somehow. But if you   re trying not to open up  the animal that much, then that   s not something that   s     Well, I think that they concluded that these animals were getting it from  these ponds where they were getting water. I don   t know if it had to be  100 percent that way, but most of it was that. They thought that   s where  they got the infection.  I was just trying to get a sense of what was known about that.  But, with an animal that died, they would have hemorrhaged from the  nose, and you may see blood everywhere, and if it was in a lot, it may  not be just right at the animal, but where it had come out before they fell  down to die. And then you   d have a lot of blood come out of the nose,  15  Larson  Arnold  Larson  Arnold  Larson  Arnold  Larson  Arnold  Larson  and that would be full of anthrax organisms.  Do you remember anything about the spread of the outbreak to various  counties as it went along as you were vaccinating?  No. I don   t think of it as being spread from   the occurrence of it was  from having similar conditions. We   ll say it started in Vinita. The area  that surrounded Vinita that had the identical or similar environment, the  rains and then dropped off, is that all of the ground up there basically  had these spores in it. If the environmental conditions got right, then  they would be available for the cattle to pick up and get infected and die.  And that was how it was   I mean, it wasn   t spreading from one animal  to another.  It was just that the environmental conditions were similar in that whole  area.  Yes. And if you had, let   s say, a place that didn   t have the spores in the  ground, then you couldn   t have anthrax, because there wasn   t anything  there to cause it. I suppose there was probably areas   let   s say that this  was happening in flat land, and then you had hilly country, then it  probably would shut off when you got into that hilly country where it  was well drained and you didn   t have as many lakes that would fit the  criteria for having the spores.  Did that part of northeastern Oklahoma normally have that sort of  anthrax threat? Is it someplace where this had occurred in the past that  you know of?  It   s my understanding that as far back in history as they know, and I  expect they don   t have a good record on that, that the opportunity  existed there since early on, we   ll say, if it came from the buffalo. From  the time that people began to settle it, there was always the risk of  anthrax. Fortunately, the weather conditions was such that it just didn   t  show itself. When the weather conditions was just right, then it would  come up and     It would be abnormal there to have that sort of weather condition.  Yes.  Because apparently the spores had to be there previously in order to  start this, but the weather conditions were unusual that year. Besides the  weather conditions, was there anything about the 1957 outbreak that  was unusual, in terms of the scope or the size or the concentration?  16  Arnold  Larson  Arnold  Larson  Arnold  Larson  Arnold  Well, yes. The years prior to that and the years following that, the  weather conditions was such that they may have an occasional one, but  not the extent that we had at that time. If you just had one or two, then it  didn   t rise to the occasion that they said,    Okay, in order to protect our  livestock, we   ve got to go in and vaccinate everything.    If you only had  one case up there, the way I understand it is that that   s probably left to  the individual owner. Now, let   s say they had a case in Vinita, one case,  and the owner said,    Well, okay, will the federal or the state come in and  vaccinate my cattle?    They don   t keep it on hand, but I   d expect they  would advise the owner,    No, we don   t have it, and we don   t have the  personnel free to come up and do this. However, if you saw fit, you can  obtain the vaccine from such and such place and vaccinate it if you think  it warrants the time and the trouble and the expense.     You said you were involved with the vaccination project for about three  months, you think. Were you involved at all with that outbreak after that,  I mean, paperwork or reports or anything?  No. One of the things, and I brought this little book. As federal  employees then, we were on a salary, but they recommended that we  keep a   they had a book that they furnished us that they called a  memorandum. This was a book, and I had books like this, and I kept  them, if I knew I was going to have this interview, if I   d have had my  book, then I could   ve told you the date that I showed up there and the  day that I left, and I would   ve had in there the mileage and who I  contacted and how many I vaccinated and things like that. This was a  livestock inspector, and in here, like here   s an example, he says he left  Stigler at 7:30 and arrived back at Stigler at 5:30, and this is what he did  that day.  And this is just a sample from 1961.  He kept the mileage, because either he was driving a government car, if  it wasn   t a government car, we drove our own vehicles and we were paid  mileage. They just wanted a record, something to back up what we said  we did, what we did and didn   t do.  So, over the years as you gathered those, would you just keep those for a  couple of years as office paperwork, essentially?  We   d keep them, and we wasn   t required to turn them in. They wanted  us to keep them. During my career, I moved around a lot. So, if I had  those and they was ten years old and we moved, then they got junked.  They got burned or left or whatever. So, I don   t have any of mine. I  didn   t have a need for them.  17  Larson  Arnold  Larson  Arnold  Larson  Arnold  Larson  Arnold  Larson  Arnold  Larson  And once you   ve gotten a couple of years past something    As far as the  economic impact of that outbreak went, do you know anything about the  aftermath with that or what effect it may have had?  No. The effect, I think, would be on   I   d say that the cattle market, if  anything, probably went down rather than up. You probably had people  that said,    Okay, they   re having anthrax up there, and I   m not going to  go up there and buy any of those cattle because I   m afraid of them.     There was probably a negative impact there. The other impact was that  some of those large producers maybe had to hire extra help, or they had  to divert their hired help to working those cattle, gathering them and  putting them through chutes whenever they could and would   ve been  building fence and doing other things. It cost them to spend the time to  handle the cattle. The bigger the ranch operation, the more it would cost  them.  Did you have to do any certifications after the fact, clearing farms after  you   d given vaccinations or anything like that?  No.  Do you think there were any particular lessons learned from the 1957  event, in terms of diagnostics, pathology, logistics or anything like that?  Not that I could point to. There might   ve been some studies and some  summarizations or something somewhere, but I don   t know about them.  It seemed to be such a large outbreak that was sort of out of the  ordinary, I didn   t know if maybe they figured out on the ground that,  logistically, here are some ways that we can streamline this next time.  Well, yes, I mean, there might   ve been some estimates about what it cost  the industry and things like that, but I don   t know of anything.  Do you have any sense of how many cattle you vaccinated, other  animals you vaccinated, while you were out there for that time?  It   s been so long, it   d strictly be a guess and it wouldn   t help anybody, I  don   t think. If you   re out on the big ranch, you may do 400, and then if  you went to someone else that just had small herds and you had to rope  them and tie them up, 100 head, maybe, would be a hard day   s work, a  long day   s work.  Speaking of which, how long were your average days during that time?  Do you remember? Were they longer than usual?  18  Arnold  Larson  Arnold  Larson  Arnold  Larson  Arnold  Larson  Arnold  Yes. I   d say ten- and twelve-hour days were not uncommon, because we  were dedicated and we wanted to do as much as we could when the  weather was fit, when it was right. It was hot weather, and we didn   t  have to worry that much about the rain and the cold weather. We  vaccinated them as fast as we could get them lined up.  This was sort of a trial by fire for you, because you got out of vet school  and the first thing you know, you   re on the front lines with this big  outbreak. What did you do once you were done with this and went back  to working for the USDA?  After that? Well, one of the big things then, we were starting the  brucellosis eradication program in Oklahoma. After that, I went back  and did brucellosis testing primarily in Pottawattamie County. All along,  we had TB eradication programs going on, and I did some TB testing  and, you know, brand the reactors and ship them out to slaughter. But  that was the big thing for me at that time.  And how long did you work for the USDA, then?  Twenty-five years.  Once you got out from working with the USDA, did you set up a private  practice, or you had your home farm or ranch?  I was living in Sapulpa, and I started going to law school at Tulsa  University. Then I went to Montana as a point of entry veterinarian and  spent a year up there. Then I came back to Oklahoma City and worked  in the office on the administrative side of it. I got a law degree at  Oklahoma City University. When I got that law degree in 1972, my old  Veterinarian in Charge, Dr. Hansen, called me up and he said,    USDA  in Hyattsville, Maryland,    (that   s where their office was)    the lawyers  and the veterinarians speak two languages up here.     Can you translate? (Laughter)     And since you   ve got a law degree now, we   d like to have you come up  and work with us on enforcement and writing regulations.    So, in 1973,  I went to work in Washington DC. I lived in the panhandle of West  Virginia and commuted by train for twelve years and worked on the staff  up there. Paid as a veterinarian, but I worked with the lawyer side of it.  And then in    83, they were wanting to reduce federal employees, and I  took a retirement from the federal and came back to Coal County and  Atoka County. At first, I opened up a law office in Coalgate and I  practiced there for  about a year . Then I went to Atoka, bought a  building, and I was going to practice law and vet medicine, and I did for  19  Larson  Arnold  Larson  Arnold  Larson  Arnold  about fifteen years. Well, the law got in place of my practicing vet  medicine, so when a judge says,    You   re going to be here at 10:00,    you  better be there, and the sick cow has to wait. So, I did more law than I  did vet medicine. Then, what was it,    95, I quit doing that, and now I just  take care of animals.  So, you   ve been incredibly busy and well rounded in your career.  I guess so.  Is there anything that you can think of that we haven   t talked about with  the 1957 outbreak that you want to address, or anything we   ve missed?  I can   t think of anything.  Well, thank you very much for your help with this project. We greatly  appreciate it.  Well, you   re welcome.  -------  -------
