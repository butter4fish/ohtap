 Sherman. Today is April 18, 2009 and I   m  interviewing Mr. Lew Wade as part of the O-STATE Stories Project of  the Oklahoma Oral History Research Program. Currently, we   re sitting  in the Athletic Department offices for this interview. First off, I want to  welcome you back to campus. I know it   s a great joy to have you guys  come back and be celebrated. Thank you for your time today. I   m going  to start by  having you tell us a little about your life  prior to your OSU  experiences. Can you tell me about where you grew up and such?  Thank you, Jacob. I was born up here in Ponca City. My dad was a  coach. He later went into the oil field business and that was in Kansas  and those areas. Then we moved back to Tulsa when I was finishing  grade school. So, more or less, went through junior high and high school  in Tulsa.  What high school in Tulsa?  Tulsa Will Rogers and that   s where I did most of my sports prior to  college and, yes, I did play little league and whatever it was termed as in  those days. It was not near as organized as it is now.  Have you always had a passion for baseball or just sports in general?  At that age, junior high and high school, I had a passion for baseball and  basketball.  Did you play basketball in high school?  Oh yes.  How was your Tulsa Will Rogers baseball team?  5  Wade  Sherman  Wade  Sherman  Wade  Sherman  Wade  Sherman  Wade  Sherman  Wade  Sherman  Wade  Sherman  Wade  Sherman  Wade  Sherman  Wade  Sherman  Wade  It was a good team.  A good team?  Yes, you just interviewed a person here awhile ago, Roy Peterson, that  was a teammate of mine in high school. And in all actuality, because of  injuries, I played very little high school baseball. I played a lot of  summer baseball.  Legion ball?  Legion ball. From 6th grade on, I played a lot of summer baseball.  How good were your legion teams then?  I had one legion team that went to the finals in Oklahoma.  What team was that?  It was Tulsa Cobb Oil. It was a very good team.  What year was that they went to the finals?  It was 1956.  And where was the final held?  Hobart, in southwest Oklahoma.  Did you play Hobart?  We played a number of teams from around Oklahoma in legion ball.  Were you recruited to play baseball at Oklahoma State, or how did you  initially come into contact with the baseball team?  I came to OSU to play basketball.  Really?  I played four years of basketball.  I thought I recognized your name from somewhere else.  Yes, I was here for the basketball reunion last fall.  6  Sherman  Wade  Sherman  Wade  Sherman  Wade  Sherman  Wade  That   s right, that   s right.  But I can kind of tell you how I got into playing baseball. I was a good  legion ballplayer. But I was told coming to OSU that playing basketball  and baseball was very difficult because you get a late start on the season.  The Cowboy baseball team at the time was usually three or four deep at  every position. So, coming out of basketball to play baseball, you had  guys that had been working out for months. It was very difficult to break  into the starting lineup. So, I really did not intend to play baseball here. I  played in the summer leagues up in the Ban Johnson League in Kansas  and that was my main objective. The way I got into the baseball program  is   I don   t know how long you want to make this.  Hey, it   s as much time as   it   s for the record, so     Back in those days, baseball was a lot different than it is now. The major  leagues had bonus rules. So, if you signed a bonus contract with a major  league team, they could only pay you something like  4,500 for a bonus  player. If they paid you anything more than that, they had to take you to  the major leagues and leave you for two years before they could farm  you out to the minor leagues. So, it was kind of a control situation by the  owners in baseball. What happened is that in the late    50s, they  rescinded those bonus rules, and the major league teams started signing  players for above  4,500 knowing they could send them to their minor  league teams. This happened a little bit in the Cowboys    situation.  Again, the Cowboys were deep, four or five deep, in every position.  They were so good. Well, late in 1958 or early 1959, a rumor went  around the baseball world that they were going to rescind the new bonus  rule and go back to the old one.  So, that scared you.  Well, it scared all the good players, because we had a number of guys  here that were in line to sign for some pretty good contracts. So, there  were specifically three or four guys, Jerry Adair, a guy I played  basketball with, Lowell Townshend, I don   t know if you   ve ever heard  that name     Yes, that   s a good name.  We talked about one other this morning, Calvin Browning, Lowell  Townshend, these guys would have all played first team for the  Cowboys. They all signed major league bonus contracts because they  were afraid they were going to rescind the new bonus contract. These  guys all got  60,000,  100,000. Well, that took a few players out of the  Cowboy baseball program. And then, plus that, you know, you couldn   t  7  Sherman  Wade  Sherman  Wade  Sherman  Wade  Sherman  Wade  Sherman  Wade  Sherman  play two sports back in those days. You couldn   t play a sport in college  and then be a professional like you can now and play another sport.  Then another thing happened, and this happens to every team every year,  two or three guys got caught cheating on tests. Two or three guys got  kicked out for this and that, and then the next thing I knew   again, I had  no intention of playing baseball that year. Basketball   s a tough grind;  you get out of there  and  you just want to go hide somewhere for a  month or two. Next thing I knew, the Cowboy coach Toby Greene came  to me and he said,    I want you to play baseball this year.    And I said,     That   d be fun.    The Cowboys have a good program. They have a lot of  fun on the road and it   s exciting and basically   again, I hate to use that  word more than once, but what happened is that, due to all this  deterioration, when the first team Cowboy catcher, a guy named Ray  Bond, had mononucleosis    Anyway, all these guys got dismissed from  the team of signed pro contracts or this and that, and Toby Greene came  and said,    We   d like you to play baseball this year.    I had been a catcher  up in the Ban Johnson Leagues, and it really  would  have been more  fun to go play golf. But the Cowboy baseballers had a lot of good trips  and had a lot of fun and had a lot of parties and things like that. And it  sounded good to me, so I was on the baseball team.  So, because you were a basketball player, that   s going to lead me to a  bunch of basketball questions, if you don   t mind me asking.  Sure.  So, your scholarship was for basketball? Were you a scholarship  basketball player?  Yes.  What was your position in basketball?  Well, back in those days I was both a guard and a forward. Players  weren   t as big as they are now.  Who recruited you for basketball?  Sam Aubrey was the assistant coach in those days.  Sam Aubrey? He was with the football team, too, wasn   t he?  Back in those days they did a little bit of everything.  Yes. And so what was it like to play for Mr. Iba?  8  Wade  Sherman  Wade  Sherman  Wade  Sherman  Wade  Sherman  Wade  Sherman  Wade  Sherman  Wade  Sherman  Wade  Sherman  Wade  Sherman  Wade  How many hours you got here? It was a grind.  It was a grind?  Yes. It was not always fun. It prepared you for life.  What years did you play basketball?     56 through    60.  Did you play against Wilt Chamberlain then?  I did.  The famous game here?  I did not actually play in that game, but I was a member of the squad.  Can you recall what that game was like for you guys?  It was a rough game because the main objective was to keep Wilt away  from the ball. And it worked. And being on our home court, it came  down to one shot, and Mel Wright made the shot and we won.  Yes. Was that your highlight of your collegiate basketball career?  No.  What was your highlight, then?  I   d have to say the   Dick Soergel and I were talking awhile ago. We  were on the same teams. The highlight of our basketball career was  beating Kansas at Kansas our senior year.  Phog  Allen  Fieldhouse?  Yes, first time we ever beat them at Kansas, and we beat them by ten or  twelve, fourteen points.  Oh, wow. How good were those OSU basketball teams?  At the period I was here, we did not have that good of material. We had  very good material when I was a freshman, and we had good material  when I was a sophomore. But again, we had some deflections and guys  that left and this and that, and we just had average teams.  9  Sherman  Wade  Sherman  Wade  Sherman  Wade  Sherman  Wade  Sherman  Wade  Sherman  Wade  Sherman  Wade  Sherman  Wade  Sherman  Wade  Sherman  Did you play much or were you a starter?  I was a starter for two years.  Did you receive any accolades?  No, I was a defensive player.  So, you were the guy that got called on to guard the best guy?  Yes.  What were some of the players that you guarded against that you can  specifically recall?  Probably one of our best jobs we did was we played West Virginia in a  tournament in Kentucky and we held Jerry West to eleven points one  night. They beat us by about twelve or fourteen, but we held him to  eleven points.  And you personally held him to that?  Myself and one other guy guarded him off and on.  Oh, wow.  He   s good.  Yes, he was.  But those guys weren   t used to the tight defenses that we played. The  teams from back east, they played a wide, more open style than the  Cowboys did in those days.  Who else did you play against? Any others that stand out?  Two other victories in that same tournament, we played against Ohio  State.  Jerry Lucas?  Lucas was a freshman, did not play against him. But they still had a  good team. We beat them. Then we beat UCLA at UCLA in a  tournament out there around Christmas time that year.  So, you played against the beginnings of Coach Wooden   s teams.  10  Wade  Sherman  Wade  Sherman  Wade  Sherman  Wade  Sherman  Wade  Sherman  Wade  Sherman  Wade  Sherman  Wade  Sherman  Wade  Sherman  Wooden was there, right, and that was a thrill.  Why was that a thrill? Just the trip in general?  We beat them at home. Anytime you win on their court, it   s a thrill. Like  beating Kansas at Kansas. Thrill in sports is winning when you   re not  supposed to win.  What years did you play baseball then?  I played one year, 1959.  Just one year? Wow I didn   t     One year. I was a junior. Again, actually, I went back out the next year  again out of basketball, and all these other guys had two or three months  working out, and they were so far ahead of me that my heart just wasn   t  in it.  Getting back to your OSU experiences, did you live in Bennett Hall?  No. I lived under the football stadium. You ever heard of the stadium  rats?  No.  Used to be a laundry over there and we lived upstairs. Well, one time I  lived right across from the laundry on the first floor, and I lived up on  the second floor in the rooms up there.  Did you have a roommate?  Yes.  Who was that?  Fellow basketball players. One year I roomed with Don Heffington, the  next with Dennis Walker. And one year I lived with Maurice Pool. I  lived under there  for  four years.  You were a stadium rat for four years?  Four years.  Now, that doesn   t sound appealing, now     11  Wade  Sherman  Wade  Sherman  Wade  Sherman  Wade  Sherman  Wade  Sherman  Wade  Sherman  Wade  Sherman  Wade  Sherman  Wade  It was an honor.  Really? Why was that?  Well, you were a stadium rat. (Laughter) When we had the Iba reunion  this past fall, last December, we recognized the stadium rats. Everybody  stood up and acknowledged the handshakes or the claps because to be a  stadium rat, it was tough conditions because there wasn   t a lot of heat  under there in the winter. There wasn   t always warm water, wasn   t  always electricity, and there were a lot of mice. (Laughter) And you  think I   m kidding you.  No. (Laughter) I   m sure there were, I   m sure there were.  But we were hardship cases because we had to walk across the street to  Bennett to eat our meals. So we got paid what was called a stipend. We  got seventy-five bucks a month for living over there. And back in those  days, that was a lot of money.  Yes, but what   d you do with that money? You were a basketball player.  Spent it on girls and clothes, same thing any other normal college guy  does with it.  What was your major here?  I was in general business with minors in accounting and geography.  Besides basketball and baseball, what other activities did you do?  One year I ran track. I was a Sigma Chi and, really, that   s about all I did.  When you play sports and you play more than one sport, you don   t have  a lot of time.  So, did you rush Sigma Chi when you were a freshman?  Yes.  What was that experience like?  It was unique.  Unique?  I didn   t ever live in the house because of living over here. So, you were  kind of a   Eddie Sutton was a fraternity brother, a pledge brother of  12  Sherman  Wade  Sherman  Wade  Sherman  Wade  Sherman  Wade  Sherman  Wade  Sherman  Wade  Sherman  Wade  Sherman  Wade  Sherman  Wade  Sherman  Wade  mine. So, it   s kind of a celebrity deal.  Speaking of Eddie Sutton, what was he like back in those days?  Oh, Eddie was a real neat guy back in those days. He was a lot of fun.  He was two years older than I was, but we were in the same pledge  class. He was a real gentleman.  Did you participate in the fraternity all four years that you were here?  Yes. But, again, you don   t get to participate that much.  Yes, but it   s still a fun thing to do. A fun diversion.  Yes. Met a lot of good people.  Are you still in contact with any of them?  Some of them.  Are you still in contact with the fraternity?  Not much. I don   t have much contact with the fraternity.  Besides fraternity, you said you dated?  Sure.  What were those experiences like?  It was a different world.  How so?  OSU was very different back then. There was a six-to-one ratio. There  were six guys for every girl.  So, competition?  (Laughs) There was a lot of competition.  But you were Mr. Basketball. You should have     That doesn   t mean a thing on Friday and Saturday night. I mean, it was a  girl   s paradise, because you could go over to a sorority house or a dorm  and there were very few girls over there moving around on Friday and  13  Sherman  Wade  Sherman  Wade  Sherman  Wade  Sherman  Wade  Sherman  Wade  Sherman  Wade  Sherman  Wade  Sherman  Wade  Sherman  Saturday and Sunday nights. They all had dates. It was very good for the  ladies.  But for you?  You   d just, you know, do your best. (Laughs)  What kinds of things did you do for dates back then?  It was very limited. You had movies, go to the library and, again, it was  very limited. You had very few restaurants in Stillwater. You didn   t  have any of the Eskimo Joe   s. You had a Dairy Queen over here on  Main Street, and there was a chicken place at 6th and Main, and that was  about it. It was limited. Most of your dating activities would be around  the Student Union, the fourth floor of the Student Union. I don   t know  what that   s like now, but that drew big crowds on Friday and Saturday  night, people dancing and listening to music.  Did they bring in bands?  No, they had a jukebox.  Oh that   s right, that   s right.  You   re talking about the old days now.  Was the Student Union new at that time or barely new?  The Student Union was built in the late forties I think so it was about ten  or twelve years old. But it was, at the time, the best Student Union in the  United States.  So, the Student Union was your favorite hangout on campus?  Probably so, yes.  Off-campus, what was your favorite?  That   s probably the movie theater. The Student Union and the movie  theater and that was about it.  The Leachman?  Leachman.  You came to OSU at an interesting time period with so many changes  14  Wade  Sherman  Wade  Sherman  Wade  Sherman  Wade  Sherman  Wade  Sherman  Wade  Sherman  Wade  Sherman  Wade  Sherman  Wade  going on during the late fifties early sixties. Did you ever make it to the  Hideaway there?  The Hideaway wasn   t there.  No?  It might have been the last year I was here, but there wasn   t anything up  and down there.  Now, you came when the name change occurred, right?  Yes.  What was your opinion about that?  It was great.  Now, do you consider yourself an Aggie or a Cowboy?  Both. I was an Aggie when I was a freshman and I think it switched over  during my sophomore year when we started wearing Cowboy jerseys.  But no, I think that was a great thing.  Why was that?  Well, it just took the university to a new level. I always liked Aggies and  still do. Oklahoma State University is much higher and recognized than  Oklahoma A M College.  Now, you also came when the creation of the Pistol Pete mascot   occurred . Do you have any recollections about that?  There was no guy running around with that, but I saw Pistol Pete in the  Homecoming parades.  Oh, the original Pistol Pete?  Oh, yes. They put him up on a stagecoach and tied him in so he wouldn   t  fall off, and gave him a shotgun and he drove down the street.  That   s cool, that   s cool. I would   ve loved to see that. The stories about  him are just amazing.  Yes.  15  Sherman  Wade  Sherman  Wade  Sherman  Wade  Sherman  Wade  Sherman  Wade  Sherman  Wade  Sherman  Wade  Sherman  Wade  So, now, baseball season   we   re coming back to the 1959 baseball year.  Because you started late, when did you start baseball?  Well, March Madness, it would   ve been the end of March.  Now, did you feel behind because of when you started?  Sure. It was a totally different world walking out of basketball and going  into baseball when you hadn   t seen a baseball in six months.  Was it a relief, almost, to play baseball?  It was fun. We all played for fun. A lot of these young guys now that are  playing, they   re so intense on maybe trying to make major leagues or  professional baseball. That was in the back of your mind back then, but  the most prominent thing was having fun.  And you enjoyed it?  Oh, yes.  Now, did you practice under Gallagher  arena ?  Yes.  What were those experiences like?  That was very, very tough.  How so?  You went down there and it was dirt, and big concrete pillars, and  batting cages, and dust and very poor lighting. Toby Greene had a  different theory on batting practice. They didn   t try to get you in shape,  didn   t try to throw it up there and let you get your timing and everything.  It was full bore. Guys were throwing it, they were throwing it full bore.  And it was difficult because it was dark down there, very dark. I was a  catcher. If you can imagine walking out of the sunshine into a cellar and  trying to catch a guy throwing eighty, ninety miles an hour, it was an  experience.  A catcher. Now, did you play catcher in high school?  No, I became a catcher the summer before, up in the Ban Johnson  Leagues in Kansas. I played on a team, and all the catchers were injured  and I caught the last six or eight games. Actually, that   s how I got into  16  Sherman  Wade  Sherman  Wade  Sherman  Wade  Sherman  Wade  Sherman  Wade  Sherman  Wade  Sherman  Wade  OSU baseball, because Toby Greene says,    Hey, I heard you caught a lot  last year and we   ve had this guy kicked out, and this guy flunked out,  and then this guy   s got mononucleosis and we   re down to one catcher.  Would you come?    Sure, sure.  How many games did you catch that year?  Two.  What games were those?  I caught one and   you   ve got to understand, it   s a different situation.  Official games, maybe one. I caught a game, playing at Rice in Texas at  Houston. But you   ve got to understand that back in those days you only  played twenty-eight, twenty-six games. Like, now, they play fifty or  sixty or seventy games. And so, because of that, you played a lot of  inter-squad games. I mean, we probably played two to three inter-squad  games a week. So, did I play games? Yes, I caught a lot. Probably ten or  fifteen games there. I played shortstop. I was also a shortstop.  Did you get called up into any games? Pinch hit or anything like that?  I played   I did play in two games. I played one at Rice, and I played  one against some small college team later on in the year. I got to bat  once at Rice, and I got to bat once against this small college team.  And how   d you do with those plate appearances?  One of them I struck out; one of them I walked.  Zero for one, for your career at OSU?  No, no. I got to pinch hit twice in the College World Series. I batted  twice, got on both times. Got on with an error one time and got a base  hit the other time.  So, one for     Three.  Hey, .333 batting average is not bad.  But in those inter-squad games, I got to bat a lot. I got to bat against  some real pitchers in those teams in those games. Our pitching staff then  was probably as good as any minor league pitching staff in America, and  definitely as good, or better, than any college team. We had, again, after  17  Sherman  Wade  Sherman  Wade  Sherman  Wade  Sherman  Wade  all these deflections and all these guys leaving, we really had left about  eight or nine players that could play in the field: infielders, outfielders  and catchers. But we had about nine or ten pitchers.  Really?  We had pitchers that never got to pitch that could have played and  pitched front-line pitchers for any Big Eight team at the time. We had a  guy pitch in the College World Series, and he   s not here today. His name  is Toby Bensinger, a left-hander. He came in and pitched the fourth or  fifth game of the College World Series and he had never pitched in a  college baseball game, and he was a senior. He was a left-hander. He  went five or six innings, and we were leading when they took him out,  and he also hit a triple. That was his first college baseball game.  Oh, wow.  It was a different world, but we played a lot of inter-squad games.  How   d you do against those pitchers?  Well let me tell you   nobody   s told you about the inter-squad games?  No, no.  Coach Toby Greene was a very proud guy. I mean, he liked to win. He  was driven. And we were playing these inter-squad games a couple  times, two or three times a week. It was our second string guys playing  the first team. We had pitchers playing third base and first base and in  the outfield. I mean, we didn   t have that many players, again, due to all  those deflections. We did not have two and three deep at every position.  I would say that we probably   the second team probably won half of the  inter-squad games. Toby didn   t like that. I can remember, and I want to  tell you about these two incidences and we were talking about these  earlier, but these all   you always remember the things you did. But I  remember one time playing against Joel Horlen. He was one of our  front-line pitchers and Joel played eleven years with the Chicago White  Sox. But I can remember one time at an inter-squad game, I hit a home  run off Horlen. As I was trotting around the bases, Toby Greene, our  coach, he was a character, he comes running out of the dugout and he  runs up to the foul line. And he   s screaming. He was screaming at Benny  Bancroft out in centerfield because the ball I hit over the fence for a  home run   he was mad because Benny didn   t catch it. I mean, that   s the  way he was.  One more I can remember, I was catching a game. I was catching an  18  Sherman  Wade  Sherman  Wade  Sherman  Wade  Sherman  Wade  Sherman  Wade  Sherman  inter-squad game. I was catching Jim Mihura who was a good pitcher  that never played a college baseball game, and somebody hit a real pop  fly between home plate and the first base dugout. I threw off the mask  and I was going over there, and I was tripping over bats and gloves. You  didn   t have batboys. I was tripping over these things and I went over  right in front of the dugout and I caught this pop fly. And Toby is from  here to that wall from me and he had his hands in his pocket and   you  never knew Toby, but he was seventy, seventy-five years old and he was  mean. He looked right at me and he says   can I use a little profanity?  Yes, go ahead.  He says,    You lucky son of a bitch.    (Laughs) He was mad because he  didn   t want us beating his first team. But, again, that   s what made us the  team that we were. We wanted to win. Every one of us wanted to win.  We wanted to have fun and we wanted to win. But did I play a lot of  games? No. But did I get a lot of experience in baseball? Yes. Because  you can ask any of those other guys that are here, Peterson or Dick  Soergel, or any of them about the inter-squad games and they were good  games. I think Soergel was telling Mihura today, he said,    I lost very  few games in college,    but he says,    Mihura, I never beat you in an  inter-squad game.    There was a lot of pride there. You had to do that  back in those days because you were restricted to the number of games  you could play for the season. You couldn   t play fifty or sixty like you  can now.  What were the baseball facilities like, besides the dungeon downstairs?  (Laughs) Well, you dressed over here in the field house in the old metal  lockers and then you walked over there and practiced. There were no  facilities. All you had was a concrete dugout and some bleachers, and  the baseball playing field.  Was that a good facility?  No, but it was as good as most colleges had at the time.  Now, you came to the baseball season late. Did you feel left out?  No. I knew all those guys. They were all good friends.  Did you hang out with them like the athletes all hang out together?  Oh, yes.  In Bennett or under the stadium there?  19  Wade  Sherman  Wade  Sherman  Wade  Sherman  Wade  Sherman  Wade  Sherman  Wade  Sherman  Wade  Sherman  Wade  Sherman  Mostly under the stadium.  Is being a stadium rat really a badge of honor for you?  Sure. If you can live through that, you can live through anything. The  Army was easy.  Now, what was the team like? Was it a cohesive team? Can you describe  the dynamics of the team for me?  Basically, it was the same thing that I   ve said before. We had a bunch of  guys that knew each other well. Good friends. We wanted to have fun  and we wanted to win. And that   s what it took.  Did you also know these guys because you played against them in high  school?  Some of them.  Did that help build camaraderie?  Not really.  How did the team travel? You said you went down to Houston. What was  your travel experience like?  You just got in cars and you took off. There weren   t any buses; there  wasn   t any flying, no airplanes. You   re in individual cars and you drove  from here to Houston or here to Omaha or here to Missouri, wherever  you played. That   s how you got there.  Now, was this different than you traveling as a basketball team?  In basketball, we traveled better than that. We were either on a bus, on a  train, or in an airplane.  Why do you think that was different?  Oh, it was different. First of all, you had an athletic director that was a  basketball coach. Naturally, he   s going to spend more money on that  direction. And baseball was not a revenue sport. I don   t even think they  charged back in those days for the fans to come to the games. I could be  wrong, but I don   t think they did.  How many fans did you guys get out for baseball?  20  Wade  Sherman  Wade  Sherman  Wade  Sherman  Wade  I can   t remember more than ever being 100. I mean, old hard bleachers  and no covering, hot sun.  Now, let   s see. Let   s get back to Coach Toby Greene. Can you share  more about his personality for us?  Toby was an assistant football coach and a baseball coach. He was a  little bitty, scrawny, bird-legged, white-headed guy. Again, I remember  him being in his seventies. He was tough. He didn   t say a lot. I can tell  you a couple of funny stories. I was one of the calmer guys on the team,  meaning I wasn   t a wild man or anything like that, and I had the honor  of riding in Toby   s car with him to go on these trips.  I heard about this honor.  Usually, it was Byron Bird who drove, and he was trainer of sorts. They  didn   t have trainers like they do nowadays. Bird was an ex-military in  World War II that had got shot down during the parachute jumps into  Europe and cut off his own leg as part of that. Cut off his own leg and  made it back to the lines, and he was tough. We rode with those two  guys. It was myself and Bob and Bruce Andrew that were on the  baseball team. We were picked because we could be depended on to  make it in time in the mornings after to get in the car, and we wouldn   t  be wild men or be late for the trips or anything. But Toby and Bird were  heavy smokers. Oh man, they just   you could sit in the back seat and  inhale.  Like a chimney?  Oh, it was horrible. But one of the funny stories I remember, we were     Toby liked to eat the blue plate special. Do you know what the blue plate  special is? You go into some small town and you go into the hotel. You  go in there and they can give you immediate service and you get your  meat loaf or roast beef or whatever. That   s the way his was eating  because he didn   t like to spend a lot of time eating. Us guys, we liked  hamburgers. So we   d go into this old hotel, and we   d go in and Toby  and Bird would order the blue plate special, and the Andrew guys and I  would order hamburgers, which they   d have to cook from scratch. Well,  those guys, Bird and Toby, would always finish eating first. They   d go  out and sit in the car and smoke and then start honking the horn for us to  get out there and,    Let   s go, let   s go.     Well, one time we went into this little old scroungy town in Kansas on  the way up to who-knows-where, and we stopped at this little hotel that  they had stopped at a hundred times before. And we go in, and they  order the blue plate special and we order the hamburgers. Well, for some  21  Sherman  Wade  Sherman  Wade  Sherman  Wade  Sherman  reason they were out of the blue plate special. So, we got served first,  okay?  Yes.  So, when we finished, we go out and got in the car and we   re out there  lighting them up and having a cigarette before they come out there and  we had to throw them out real quick. We   re sitting there about five  minutes and we all look at each other, and Bruce leans over the front  seat and starts honking the horn. And it was hilarious. (Laughter) Toby  comes flying out of that hotel. I mean, he came flying out of that hotel,  he says,    You bastards,    whatever he said. (Laughter) But it was funny.  We laughed and laughed.  The other thing I can say about him that was really funny, the day after  we won the College World Series, we   re leaving Omaha. We had left the  hotel and we   re driving down the street and it   s busy, busy traffic in  Omaha. We had just won the College World Series. We all had these  magnificent plaques. I mean really, really   a plaque like, what they  gave us for winning that thing would probably cost  200 today. They  gave each one of us this beautiful plaque. Traffic is bad, and Toby   s  always impatient, and who knows, pedestrians are probably walking in  front of him and he just has all of it he can take. He leans out of the  car   of course, cars didn   t have air conditioning in those days. He leans  out the car and he takes this brand new plaque and he   s banging it on the  side of Bird   s car. I mean he is so impatient to get out of there. You  think he   d been mellow out after just winning the NCAA championship,  but he was a character. He was a real character.  Now, how does he compare with Coach Iba, since you played under both  of them?  Well, you   re talking apples and oranges. It was a totally different  situation because basketball was so controlled. You couldn   t go out and  get a hamburger; they knew where we were every second. When we  were on baseball trips, we   d drive to Boulder and you would be given a  hotel room, motel room, and  9 a day per diem and say,    Batting  practice starts at 10:30.    Okay?  All right.  They didn   t care what you did between there and 10:30 as long as you  showed up at 10:30 and that was the difference.  Was that almost refreshing for you?  22  Wade  Sherman  Wade  Sherman  Wade  Sherman  Wade  Sherman  Wade  Sherman  Wade  Sherman  Wade  Sherman  Wade  Oh yes, oh yes. That   s the main reason I played was I   d gone through so  much in three years of basketball, I just wanted to get out and have some  fun. And it was. We had lots of parties. Sometimes it   s amazing that all  those guys made it to the batting practice at 10:30, but they all did and  we won.  Do you have any interesting baseball party stories?  Oh yes, I can tell you lots of those.  Any for the record?  Yes, yes. I think the first trip we made to Rice. We had a heck of a party  in a pavilion down on the beach at   what   s the place that just got  leveled by the hurricane? South of Houston?  Galveston?  Galveston. In a pavilion out there, and I wasn   t much of a drinker so I  ended up flat out on the beach on my back watching everybody else  running up and down the beach. (Laughter)  Good times.  One of the other ones I can remember is in the Mine Shaft bar in some  little town in Colorado. We played Colorado and we won all three  games. But the first night, I think it was, we went over to this Mine Shaft  bar and had a heck of a party. It was fun. I remember some 96 year old  lady singing songs for us. Didn   t have a tooth in her head.  But could she sing?  But that brings the guys together, things like that.  So, were you a loose bunch then?  Oh, we were very loose. I mean, there wasn   t any tension. We had some  good pitching and we knew we were going to score some runs. And  again, there was not a lot of tension.  Going up to the College World Series, what was that experience like for  you?  That was very good. It was just like being here this weekend. They  treated you like kings. I mean, they didn   t spend a lot of money on you,  but they said hello, they took you out for barbecues. And they  23  Sherman  Wade  Sherman  Wade  Sherman  Wade  Sherman  Wade  Sherman  Wade  Sherman  Wade  Sherman  Wade  Sherman  recognized you every day when you went to play. The fans were great. It  was a great experience. That   s one of the best things in college sports is  Omaha and the College World Series.  Yes. Now, was this your first time playing in a minor league stadium?  No, I   d done that before several times in Tulsa and Oklahoma City and  Wichita. It was good fun. It was a good place to play.  Now, what games did you get into the series? Who did you play against?  I can   t remember the first one, but again we were behind and I got up  and hit the ball well, went right through the third baseman. It was an  error but I hit it hard. Then the second game was probably one of the  biggest thrills of my life as far as sports go.  Why is that?  We were behind and we were playing Connecticut or somebody like that  and we were behind     Clemson?  No, we weren   t playing Clemson. And this left-hander was really giving  us troubles. I went in to pinch hit for Ray Bond who was our catcher, but  Ray was a left-handed hitter and this was a left-handed pitcher.  It was a match-up thing.  Yes. I got a base hit to right and started a rally, and I think we eventually  scored three or four runs and won that game. Then, the next game we  won was the championship game. And the second, maybe not the  second, one of the other thrills in my life in sports was when I came in  here today and I had two guys mention that pinch hit to me today.  Oh, wow.  I mean, two of my teammates that I   ve never had that mentioned before.  And that was a real thrill because I didn   t get to play a lot, but I was a  good hitter.  That   s good.  But them telling me about that, it was a real thrill.  Wow. How would you think the    59 club would rank with the other great  24  Wade  Sherman  Wade  Sherman  Wade  Sherman  Wade  Sherman  Wade  Sherman  Wade  Sherman  OSU baseball teams?  If you could take the    59 pitching staff and put them out here on the field  right now, you could take that team right there to the College World  Series. It was the best pitching staff on a college team, maybe of all  time. I mean, there were three guys that were Triple A or better pitchers.  Maybe three more that never got to play, and there were three or four  right below them that could   ve pitched for practically any college in the  nation. They were a great pitching staff. I caught them, I know, they  could throw. And then, the next year there were two other young guys  that were freshmen when we won the NCAA, came into the rotation that  were equally as good. A kid named Jimmy Wickson and a young man  named Littleton Fowler. Because you   ve got to understand, back in  those days the major leagues didn   t do what they do now. The major  leagues now, they go in and sign up all the flamethrowers out of high  school and put them in the minor leagues. They never get to play college  ball. And that didn   t happen back in those days. They didn   t sign bonus  players out of high school like they do now. So there were a lot of good  pitchers.  And you could also develop your pitching in college.  Yes. Yes.  More learn sliders and     Yes.  Did you have any problems as a catcher or did you like catching?  Again, I didn   t catch that many years, but no, I didn   t have any  problems. It   s hard work but it   s fun. Fortunately, I didn   t get any foul  ball injuries. And you have got to understand, this whole year I was one  injury away from being a starter. I mean, I was the utility man, whether  it be catcher, infielder, or outfielder. But we only played thirty games,  and nobody ever got hurt. We never had an injury.  Oh, wow.  It was amazing. Nobody even sprained an ankle.  So, they were good, physically fit, then.  Physically fit.  How did you guys celebrate your National Championship?  25  Wade  Sherman  Wade  Sherman  Wade  Sherman  Wade  Sherman  Wade  Sherman  Wade  Sherman  Wade  Sherman  Wade  Sherman  Wade  Sherman  We had a party.  Where at?  Some bar at the hotel, some bar down the street or whatever. It didn   t  really last that long because Toby wanted to get up and leave at 6:30 or  7:30 in the morning.  How was your reception in Stillwater, then?  The reception in Stillwater we received   we were supposed to drive as a  caravan, all three cars together, but it always got fouled up. I can  remember our car arriving in the parking lot out here on the outside,  south side of Gallagher, and there were 50 or 100 fans out there. It was  fun.  Did the wrestlers get more attention at that time or no?  They got a lot of attention. They won some championships in those  days. They had some Olympic wrestlers. They were a good team.  Because also the same year you guys won the title, the wrestlers won.  Were they treated any differently?  Not that I know of. In fact, I don   t remember them winning in    59. They  won it in    59 also?  Yes, I believe so.  That   s great. I don   t remember that.  It was like an OSU dynasty.  Yes, those guys were tough. Boy, those guys, they were in condition.  You ever see a wrestler walk down a flight of stairs on his hands?  Oh, wow. (Laughs)  I   m serious. Those guys were tough.  That   s right. Coach Gallagher.  Well, the coach at that time was Myron Roderick.  That   s right, that   s right.  26  Wade  Sherman  Wade  Sherman  Wade  Sherman  Wade  Sherman  Wade  Sherman  Wade  Sherman  Wade  Sherman  Wade  Sherman  Wade  Sherman  Wade  He was a good coach. He was an Olympic wrestler himself.  So, now, wrapping up here, what have you done since your OSU career?  I   ve been through the Army.  What   d you do in the Army?  I was in the infantry. Went through OCS, became an officer, which was  easy compared to playing basketball here. Left the Army and got in the  insurance business, and that   s where I   ve been ever since.  Did you go through Benning?  Fort Benning, yes.  What was that training like?  You ever gone twenty-four weeks without a candy bar or a Coke?  No, not yet.  It was tough, very physical. But again, compared to college sports, it  was easy.  Now, what lessons have you learned from sports that you take with you  that you use on a daily basis?  Again, the greatest thrill in sports is winning when you   re not supposed  to win, and never give up. Just keep the nose to the grindstone, and good  things are going to happen. I   ve won tennis tournaments; I   ve won golf  tournaments on the same philosophy. Just keep on bearing down.  Is there anything you would also like to add?  No, I appreciate this. I appreciate this reunion and my years here.  Enjoyed it very much.  Have you been following Cowboy sports lately? Are you still an avid  follower?  You   ve got to understand, have you ever played before 20,000 people?  No, I have not.  When you play before 20,000 people, you have a tremendous adrenaline  27  Sherman  Wade  Sherman  Wade  Sherman  Wade  Sherman  Wade  Sherman  Wade  Sherman  Wade  Sherman  Wade  Sherman  Wade  rush. If I went out there tonight and watched that football game or  watched one of them on TV, I mean, I throw things. I want them to win  so bad. If ever I had a heart attack in my life, it would be either here in  Gallagher Hall or out on that football stadium wanting them to win. I  want them to win so bad that I don   t watch them.  What do you think about these facilities?  It   s great, absolutely great.  Changed since your days, that   s for sure.  You have no idea  (Laughter)  Where   s Lewis Field again? Oh wait, never mind. (Laughs)  You just have no idea how great this is. You have to     Does that give you a sense of pride, then, as a former athlete?  Sure. Hey, my dad played here.  Really?  My dad played basketball here. They had an old gym over here on the  parking lot south of the stadium.  The Armory.  He played there back in the thirties. That was a long time ago. These  facilities are so great. It   s just absolutely amazing.  So, where would you rank baseball   do you have a favorite sport or do  you like them all?  Baseball is a great sport to play. It   s a very boring sport to watch.  Basketball is a great sport to play and it   s more exciting to watch it,  especially on TV. Sports were made for TV. Football, I was never big  enough in high school to play football. Football is a great sport to play,  but in person you can   t really tell what   s going on. You have to watch it  on TV to know what   s going on. Thankfully, television came along that  we   it   s so great for sports.  Yes, exactly.  Back in those days, you didn   t even know who had the ball out on the  28  Sherman  Wade  Sherman  Wade  Sherman  football field.  Well, thank you for your time here today. It   s been a pleasure.  Thank you.  And I hope you enjoy the festivities.  Oh, we   ve thoroughly enjoyed this. We really appreciate you guys doing  this.  Thank you, sir.  -------  -------
