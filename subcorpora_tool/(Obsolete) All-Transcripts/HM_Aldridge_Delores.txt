Speaker 2: A favorite food, yes, I do.  I love the gari from West Africa, Ghana, G-A-R-I.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What is it, just by the way--what?

Story_ID: 356245
Speaker 1: All right, now, I want to ask you about your family history.  I'm going to ask you about your mother's side of the family, and your fa-, and your father's [Willie Lee Aldridge, Sr.] side.  But I want to start with your mother's side of the family.  Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: Yes.  My mother's full name was Mary Ellen, E-L-L-E-N, Bennett, B-E-N-N-E-T-T, Aldridge, A-L-D-R-I-D-G-E [Mary Ellen Bennett Aldridge].
Speaker 1: And what was her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: My mother was born October 4th, 1923.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And where was she born?
Speaker 2: She was born in a small town in Georgia, Waycross, Georgia.
Speaker 1: Waycross, that's the hometown of [HistoryMaker] Ossie Davis, isn't that?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, what do you know about the ancestors on your mother's side?  How far back can you trace them?
Speaker 2: Well, I can trace my mother's family back two, three generations, I suppose.  My grandmother [Sherry Bennett George (ph.)] that I had a lot of intimate moments with, she was so much of an inspiration for me.  My great-grandmother, my grandmother's mother, I knew her only very briefly because they have lived, they lived very long spans of time.  I knew my, I knew of my mother's father, who died when she was young.  And I've heard stories about her grandfather, so that having not had any contact with my maternal--mother's father of that side of the family, I don't have a long sense of history of them, have more of a sense of history of my mother's maternal side of her family.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, what are some of the--do the stories go all the way back to the days of slavery, or any African survivals, or anything like that?
Speaker 2: I can't remember them talking so much about slavery.  I can remember them talking about their lives on the farms in Georgia.  I can remember them talking about their childhood days, and how, how long they were in terms of their relationships with other family members.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Any stories that go way back that are passed down in your family on, on your mother's side?
Speaker 2: Well, on my mother's side, they, they were very proud of, of their heritage of their parents, and of the kinds of relationships they had in the families.  And we were always told that we had to be the best of whatever we wanted to be, that there were no bars for us, no matter the fact that it was so much segregation, but that we must be the best of what we could be.  And I remember my grandmother, she would always say, whatever you have, you make the best of it, and you take it to another level.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, you said there were some stories about your grandfather on, on one side of your mother's family that passed down, what are the--can you tell us the story?
Speaker 2: Oh, well, the, the story about him is that, you know, he was, he was one of these people who loved to tell stories, and keep people laughing.  But on the other hand, he was a very serious person who made sure that they toed the line.  And they would always, my grandmother would always emphasize that to us, that there has to be a balanced quality about your lives.  You must have fun, but you must also be very serious, and be about doing things that will help you move forward.
Story_ID: 356246
Speaker 1: Now did your mother [Mary Ellen Bennett Aldridge] talk about growing up at all, or tell you any stories about growing up?
Speaker 2: Well, my, my mother, seemingly, was very, very happy in her growing up years.  She talked a lot about her older brother and, of course, about her older sister.  And then, she had two younger sisters, and they remained very close until the time that my uncle died.  But she talked about them and talked about how they would, they would play with each other.  They would play games--that they didn't have much financially because her daddy had died when she was very young.  But the other folk in her mother's [Sherry Bennett George (ph.)] family, seemingly, had much more material possessions, and they were small entrepreneurs, and they had more education.  But that her mother, who ended up raising them by any means she had, which was usually domestic work and the like, but she saw that these kids got through school, and did receive a lot of assistance from her, her siblings who were better off.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, was she raised in Waycross [Georgia] itself in, in town?
Speaker 2: Waycross, and then they moved to Florida, to Tampa [Florida].
Speaker 1: Okay, when she was still young?
Speaker 2: Yes, when my mother was still young.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, did she have a chance to, to go for higher education or anything?
Speaker 2: My mother finished high school.  And she was credentialed, believe it or not, she had a certificate in electrical work.
Speaker 1: Now, that's, that's odd in those days--
Speaker 2: Yes because (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) for a woman to have a degree as an electrician, yeah.
Speaker 2: --what, and what, what she would do, she, she was better at doing these things than was my dad [Willie Lee Aldridge, Sr.].  She could fix the electrical wires in the house, and she could help with the plumbing in the house.  She was just some incredible woman.  She could just do all kinds of things.  And that's not to say that my dad couldn't do them, but she was just better at doing these kinds of things than he was.
Speaker 1: Well, that's interesting.  So, did she study at an industrial school, or something for that kind of--
Speaker 2: Yes, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you remember what school she went to?
Speaker 2: It was a school in Tampa, but I'm not sure whether it was--it may have been the old Don Thompson High School [Don Thompson Vocational High School, Tampa, Florida] or not.  I'm not sure.
Story_ID: 356247
Speaker 1: Well, can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Yes.  My father's full name was Willie L. Aldridge or Willie Lee, L-E-E, Aldridge, A-L-D-R-I-D-G-E [Willie Lee Aldridge, Sr.].
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: My daddy was born December 19th, 1921.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And where was he born?
Speaker 2: He was born in Quincy, Florida.
Speaker 1: Quincy, Florida?  Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Quincy, Florida, Q-U-I-N-CY, Florida.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what do you know about the ancestors on your father's side?  How far back can you trace that line?
Speaker 2: I don't know very much about my father's side.  I do know my father's mother and father because they--well, no, I, I remember my, my father, my father's mother and father, my grandparents, Leila [Leila Tolliver Aldridge] and James Aldridge [James Lee Aldridge], and my great-grandmother on my daddy's side, Sarah Aldridge [ph.].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And my great-grandmother, now we talk about it, she actually lived with us for a short period of time with, with my mother [Mary Ellen Bennett Aldridge] and father and, and my sibling.
Speaker 1: So, your great-grandmother, she, well--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --she would, had to been born in the 19th century.
Speaker 2: She probably, probably was, but I just don't remember a lot of what she had to say about her growing up days.
Story_ID: 356248
Speaker 1: Though I had the, the real good fortune of, of knowing these grandparents on both my father [Willie Lee Aldridge, Sr.] and mother's [Mary Ellen Bennett Aldridge] side.  And, in fact, as, as we talk, I'm thinking now about my great-grandmother on my mother's side that I really did know her because she lived in Lake City, Florida.  And we would go there and we would play with the well.  She had a pecan orchard.  And she was a midwife.  And we would go on weekends and spend time with her.  And I remember one time when my brother [Willie Lee Aldridge, Jr.]--we went to a funeral there of one of my uncles--and my brother was there with the well.  And he had never seen a well that you could pump, and he pumped with his white suit on, and fell over in the dirt.  And they had to pick him up.  He would just, went on to sleep in the mud.  He had such a good time.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But, yes, I, I do remember my great-grandmothers on both sides.  I'm really quite fortunate as, as I think about it (laughter).
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Are there any stories that, that you remember that they told or anything or any--
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: --about growing up, about, about life in that part of the country?
Speaker 2: --well, my great-grandmother on my mother's side, as I, as I think of a grandmother, a great-grandmother, (unclear), who was a midwife.  And she was the one who birthed so many of these kids in the area, and was just very highly respected and the like.  And she even talked about having birthed several of the white kids in that area, even though it was a segregated community.
Speaker 1: There weren't a lot--people weren't going to the doctor having a baby in the hospital in those days (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well--
Speaker 1: --and that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: --at, at that time, no, they were having them there.  And, in fact, my own--I was born in my grandmother's house--myself, my brother, and my sister [Marjorie Aldridge-Holder].  And my youngest sister [Jacquelyn Aldridge-Frederick] was born in our house, so all of us were born at home and attended to by midwives.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, you know, like, I guess, since the 1980s, midwifery is back, and people are, you know, but had, it wasn't that long ago (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, yeah.
Speaker 1: --in some parts of the country.  But it was still, the fact that it probably was still going on in some places, huh?
Speaker 2: Uh-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 356249
Speaker 1: Well, any other stories about your father's [Willie Lee Aldridge, Sr.] side of the family?  Do, do they have any traditions from the slave experience or anything like that?  Do they go back that far?
Speaker 2: Well, I, I can't, I can't think of any.  I can't think of any at this point, no, I really don't.  I remember them talking about them.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But my, my dad was a great storyteller, too.  He loved to tell stories.  And I can remember sitting around the dining table and, oh, breaking bread, and him telling all kind of stories about growing up and the places that he worked in Tampa [Florida]--in the grocery stores and sweeping stores, sweeping the floors, and cleaning barbershops, and that kind of thing, and how they would, how the folk there would treat black folk.  I remember them talking about a Mr. Sam [ph.] but, yeah, he had a pleasant, pleasant memory of the way in which he was treated as he worked as a boy in the grocery store.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Any specific stores about things that happened to him?
Speaker 2: No, other than, than they were, they were encouraging to him.  And he, he didn't have any negatives that he, that he talked about.  And I, I guess, you're likely to remember a lot of negatives (laughter), as opposed to so many of the positive things that, that did occur.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, did he talk about growing up and going to school, and that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: Yes.  And I guess if you're talking about memories, and one of the things that I remember most, he talks about he was going to be a great prize fighter--always talking about this, about how he fought when he was in high school, and the like, and that he would have made it to the top.  But my mother [Mary Ellen Bennett Aldridge] did not come out to one of his prize fights.  And he was looking around for her, looking for Chica, and that was what he called--Chica meant little one in Spanish.  She called her Chica, C-H-I-C-A--looking around for her, and she wasn't in the audience.  And the guy gave him a knockout.  He knocked on the floor, and he just never came back after that to be a prize fighter.  But he blames it on my mother, and he always tells that story over and over.  If she had been there, he would have been a great prize fighter (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay (laughter).  So, he gave her a Spanish nickname or he (unclear), okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.  Well, keeping in mind, we grew up in a Spanish community.  And so, we would often exchange words in Spanish, and we ate Spanish food and Italian food.  It was a diverse community, even though it was segregated.  The South was segregated, and we had to go to segregated churches, and we went to segregated schools and the like.  But within our, in the context of our neighborhood, there were all these folk there in Ybor City [Tampa, Florida]--
Speaker 1: Now, how do you spell that again?
Speaker 2: That's Y-B-O-R and it's pronounced Ybor in Spanish.  And it's now a historic district in Tampa and it's really been revitalized.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, did your father--what did your father do for a living?
Speaker 2: My father started off as a Pullman porter on the railroad, the Seaboard railroad line [Seaboard Air Line Railroad].  And after that--well, he, first of all, he was in the service.  He was in the [U.S.] Navy, and then he came back, he was a Pullman porter.  And from that, he became a civilian personnel employee at MacDill Air Force Base.  That's M-A-C-D-I-L-L Air Force Base in Tampa, Florida.  And he worked there until he had a stroke back in 196-, I think '64 [1964], or '65 [1965], and he never really fully recovered.  He was always partially paralyzed after that time.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, and while he was working at MacDill, he was also a person who, who was the night foreman for Montgomery Ward Company [Montgomery Ward and Company], in Tampa.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 356250
Speaker 1: Is there a story about how your parents [Mary Ellen Bennett Aldridge and Willie Lee Aldridge, Sr.] met?
Speaker 2: Well, they met in junior high school, and then they went to the same high school.  And I, I can remember him saying that, you know, she had an eye for him.  She was looking at him.  He was looking at her.  And pretty soon, both of them were looking at each other, and from that--led to them having a courtship.  But, you know, back then, my, my grandpar-, my grandmother was very protective.  And, and so, they had limited kinds of encounters unless they were in the pre-, the, the presence of other adults.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, the old-fashioned kind of chaperoned (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, same as I grew up under (laughter).
Story_ID: 356251
Speaker 1: Tell me about your parents' [Mary Ellen Bennett Aldridge and Willie Lee Aldridge, Sr.] personalities, and who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: My mother is just a, she was a beautiful woman, just a genuinely, genuinely good human being, but very strong in her convictions, quiet-spoken, a demeanor with her head always up in the air as she walked.  I take much of my persona after her.  Sometimes when I look in the mirror now, I think I'm looking at her.  And so, I, I think I take a lot of my persona after her.  I think I take a lot of my assertiveness from my, my daddy, who always, always believed that I could be somebody great, and that was, that, that was a part of him.  And he's a very, he was a tall man, well-built man, handsome man.  And then, my mother was a very pretty woman, I thought.  Well, we, we would probably think that, if I think I look like her.  But, anyway, they, they made a beautiful couple.  And I think I took part of my, I, I took partly from, from my mother, and partly from my dad.
Story_ID: 356252
Speaker 1: Well, can you give us your first childhood memory, your earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: Earliest childhood memory.  I suppose it was playing with our dog, Mickey [ph.].  And I was a little girl and my brother [Willie Lee Aldridge, Jr.] and my sister [Marjorie Aldridge-Holder], because I can never remember life without my brother and my sister.  It seems, they were always there because we were what were considered stair-step children.
Story_ID: 356253
Speaker 1: So, it was just the three of you?
Speaker 2: Well, there are just the three of us now.  Much later on, my baby sister [Jacquelyn Aldridge-Frederick] was born when I was in eighth grade [at Booker T. Washington Junior High School, Tampa, Florida], but my baby sister was a victim of the September 11th [September 11, 2001 (9/11)] tragedy.  She was on the ninety-eight floor of the World Trade Center [New York, New York] when the first plane went directly into the window of her office.  So, there are three of us still, and she is gone.  But I can never remember life without my brother and my sister because we were stair, we're stair-step children (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.  So, they were older than you, and then you came along?
Speaker 2: No, I'm the oldest--
Speaker 1: You're the oldest, okay.
Speaker 2: --I'm the first, and then my brother, and then my sister.  My brother lives in Lavonia, Georgia, and my sister lives in Barbados.
Speaker 1: What are their names?
Speaker 2: My brother's name is Willie Lee Aldridge, Jr. and my sister's name is Marjorie Aldridge-Holder, H-O-, H-O-L-D-E-R is the last name, Aldridge-Holder.
Story_ID: 356254
Speaker 1: What were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up in your neighborhood [Ybor City] in Tampa [Florida]?  And it sounds like a very unique neighborhood.
Speaker 2: Well, you know, we had the cooking of southern black folk.  And I can remember so much the smell of the collard greens and the turnip greens and the cornbread.  And my mother [Mary Ellen Bennett Aldridge] baked the best apple pies and the pound cakes.  And I can remember the, the fried fish on Saturdays which was traditional.  You had fish and grits on Fridays, Friday evenings.  But I also remember the Cuban ham sandwiches, and the black beans, and the chicken in yellow rice, or arroz con pollo, the frijoles negros from the Spanish community because, keeping in mind, that all of these folk were a part of the pot in, within a four- or five-block radius of which we lived.  And then I can remember so much the Italian food because once a week or more, we would have Italian spaghetti and the Italian bread.  So, we had a mixture of foods, and so we had all kinds of scents that you would have.  The aromas were, you know, just very thick throughout the neighborhood.  And, and even now, when I go back to Tampa, I, I want to go and get the, the original spaghetti, and I want to go and get the original Cuban hams, and deviled crab sandwiches.  And then, of course, you know, I'm going to eat with the family, and have the traditional southern black food, which I will never get away from.
Story_ID: 356255
Speaker 1: So you say there were a lot of Cubans when you were growing up.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: This was even, this was before --
Speaker 2: Um-hm, see (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) Castro [Fidel Castro] ascended into power even or, or after?
Speaker 2: It--well, see, see the--Tampa [Florida] was one of the biggest meccas for Cubans, and it remains a place where there are large number of, of Cubans.  And so, the area [Ybor City, Tampa, Florida] I lived in had a large representation of Cubans, and the edifices, their buildings, the restaurants, las (unclear), the Colombian restaurants.  All these restaurants were right there, and the local meeting house for them and then you'd have black churches.  So, you, you just had all of this in, in this area.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But what I was asking is, were Cubans a large quantity there before Castro ascended to power, or did they just arrive, or had they been there for a long time?
Speaker 2: Well, I, I think that we had a number of them before Castro because that was the first wave.  And then, we had a second wave to come after Castro.
Story_ID: 356256
Speaker 1: I was asking you about--well, Tampa [Florida] was a minor league city for the Cincinnati Reds--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and all of Florida was like spring training for--
Speaker 2: Right, um-hm (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) you know, all the Major League [Major League Baseball] ball teams.  And you were talking about going to--off camera, you were talking about going to--
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, yes, my, we--my daddy [Willie Lee Aldridge, Sr.] took the family to so many of the games.  In fact, we looked forward to it.  This was a part of our recreation to go the games and sit out and have hot dogs and popcorn.  And, of course, Brooklyn Dodgers [Los Angeles Dodgers] was our favorite because Jackie Robinson, who had broke into the Majors, was such a star.  And so, that was our, that was our star, and we went to many of the games during spring training.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I guess it must have been a big deal with baseball being integrated for the first time to see the black players and--
Speaker 2: It was a big deal.  And I mean, throughout our neighborhood, people, if they didn't go to the games themselves, they'd listen to them on the radio, and it's just a big thing.  Everybody have their radio going on for the basketball--I mean, for the baseball games.  And then, when the fights were on, everybody's on their front porches with the radios going, and pints of ice cream, eating them, and, you know, it was just a good time.
Speaker 1: Did the baseball players, or the baseball teams, like boost economies down there when you were a kid?  Did you have any sense of that when they 'cause every spring, I guess, all the teams were in Florida.  Or I mean some were in Arizona, I guess, but most of them were in Florida.
Speaker 2: Well, I, I would suppose they did.  I guess at that point in time, I didn't think too much about the economy, but we did know a lot of folk were coming out, so a lot of people were spending money.  So, I, I would suppose that it did boost the economy during the, during the (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Did the people in the neighborhood have jobs over there?  I mean, I'm guessing I'm asking that.  Did they--
Speaker 2: Well, the folk in my neighborhood didn't have jobs with the team because, you know, all folk in my job, uh, in my neighborhood, have regular jobs.  I don't remember nobody not having a job in my neighborhood, just as I don't remember anybody not having a momma and daddy at home in my neighborhood (laughter).  You know, everybody had two people, two parents in the home.  And so it, and so when I went to college [Clark College; Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia], and they were telling me about the black families falling apart, I didn't know what they were talking about because it did not reflect any of my experiential base.
Story_ID: 356257
Speaker 1: Now, what was the housing like?  What kind of houses did you all live in, in the neighborhood?
Speaker 2: Well, there, there were, in my neighborhood, there were, you know, separate dwellings.  Everybody had individual houses because when I grew up in the '50s [1950s] and early '60s [1960s], there were not many apartments or con-, nothing called condos, and there were not many apartments there.  There were a couple of housing projects--one in West Tampa [Tampa, Florida], as I recall, and one over in East Tampa [Tampa, Florida], or in Belmont Heights [Tampa, Florida].  And many of the young couples went into housing projects, as their first stepping stone to later buying their own house, or moving into a separate, unattached dwelling.  Our first house that my parents [Mary Ellen Bennett Aldridge and Willie Lee Aldridge, Sr.] had, we were in the housing projects in West Tampa.  And so, many of my friends were in the housing projects.  And they're all now, most of them--they're judges, they're doctors, they're lawyers, whatever.  That was the stepping stone.  There weren't apartments, and so if you left your parents' homes, you had to find a place.  And that was your jump-off point was the housing project.  And then, I know for my-, for, for myself, we lived in the housing projects the first two years of my life.  And then, my daddy paid for his house, our house, and we had one of these big two-story dwellings.  Yeah, we call them, you have two floors, they call them now, but we called them two stories 'cause the big tall houses.  And you see so many of them in Atlanta [Georgia] going up now.  Well, that's what I grew up in with the yard and with hedges, with cherries in the hedges that you could pluck off and eat, and mango tree, and orange tree, grapefruit tree in my backyard.  My neighbor- with avocado, pear tree, mango tree, so that was my experience throughout my growing up from the time I was two years of age until I left home, is that we had our own independent dwelling, which was bought and paid for, because my daddy did not believe in debt.  He felt you shouldn't take anything home if you, if you hadn't paid for it.  And so, he was one of these people--you pay cash for whatever you get.  And he was one of those people who believed in saving bonds, U.S. savings bonds, having taken out of his check every two weeks.  And so, he was a person who believed in stock piling and looking to the future, a person who believed in not being in debt, but in fact, paying as you go.
Story_ID: 356258
Speaker 1: Well, tell us about school.  What school did you start off at?
Speaker 2: I started off in a private school, Ms. Brown's [ph.] private school in Tampa [Florida], as did my brother [Willie Lee Aldridge, Jr.] and my sister [Marjorie Aldridge-Holder].
Speaker 1: Where did, where did she (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That was--
Speaker 1: I was asking, where did she hold school, was--
Speaker 2: In a church [Mount Sinai A.M.E. Zion Church, Tampa, Florida], in a church on Nebraska Avenue, and went there until I was--the first three years of my education.
Speaker 1: So, it was until third grade?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then went to Meacham Elementary School [Christine Meacham Elementary School, Tampa, Florida].  That's M-E-A-C-H-A-M, Meacham Elementary School.
Speaker 1: Now, Ms. Brown's school, was that, was there a specific reason why you went to a private school for the first three years?
Speaker 2: Because she was known to get kids on the right track.  Myrna Genevieve Brown [ph.] was her name.  And Ms. Brown's school was one that people would struggle to come up with the funds so that they could send kids there because the kids got launched.
Story_ID: 356259
Speaker 1: So, Meacham School [Christine Meacham Elementary School] was a regular public school in Tampa [Florida] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm, a regular public school--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --Meacham Elementary School.
Speaker 1: They were, you're saying they were a segregated school still when they were coming along (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It was a segregated school, yes.  I went to segregated schools throughout my K [kindergarten] through twelve.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, was Meacham named after a black person?
Speaker 2: I don't think so, no.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Well, how was Meacham?
Speaker 2: Meacham was--I, I, I think it provided a good background.  But I had already gotten some of the rudimentaries from Ms. Brown [ph.], and then went to Meacham, and had teachers who were committed, very dedicated, and who stayed on you to make sure that you got what you needed to get.  And so, I think it was a good preparatory school in, in the early, in the early formation of, of, of my education.  There were extracurricular activities.  There was the academic thing.  And I guess what I remember most at Meacham is that I met a couple of my friends that are still my friends today, some sixty years later.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Well, do you want to name them (laughter)?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.  Alberta Singleterry [ph.], she's still in Tampa.  And Alma Signes [ph.], whom I met a little bit later, she's in Tampa.  Irene Kilpatrick [ph.], who is in Minneapolis, Minnesota--just, just any number of them that, that I'm still in touch with.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And early--any teachers that you really remember at Meacham?
Speaker 2: I think I remember a Ms. Wright [ph.] and a Ms. Williams [ph.] when I was in elementary school, and they, they were, they were very good teachers.  They, they were my homeroom teachers, so I, I remember them.
Speaker 1: Now, did your teachers live in your neighborhood?
Speaker 2: They lived in the black neighborhood, yes, but not in my immediate neighborhood, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So, what was your favorite subject in school, or did you have one?
Speaker 2: I really didn't have a favorite subject.  I liked all of my subjects and I did just as well in all of them.  I guess I made all A's in anything I took, so I liked them all.  I really liked math.  I liked Spanish.  I liked history.  I liked the social sciences.  I liked all my classes.  I, I liked school a great deal.
Story_ID: 356260
Speaker 1: Did you have any idea what you wanted to be when you grew up when you were in school?
Speaker 2: Well, I, when I left Meacham Elementary School [Christine Meacham Elementary School, Tampa, Florida], I went to Booker T. Washington Junior High School [Tampa, Florida].  And Booker T. Washington Junior High School, of course, is named after Booker T. Washington, who was once the president of and founder of Tuskegee Institute [Tuskegee State Normal School; Tuskegee University] in Tuskegee, Alabama, now Tuskegee University.  That school was a, a very impressionable one for me, as were the teachers there.  And the one that I remember most was Ms. Sheehy and she was--
Speaker 1: How do you spell that?
Speaker 2: S-H-E-E-H-Y.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She, she was married to a medical doctor--I think the only medical doctor, black medical doctor we had in Tampa [Florida] at the time, Paul Sheehy [Paul Sheehy, Sr.].  And they were just really good role models.  They were very inspirational, and always telling us that we could do whatever we wanted to do.  And we--they expected us to go to the top.  They expected us to be successful, just always pride and prodding.  And they, they left real marks on me in terms of moving on to the next level because I finished junior high school as valedictorian of my class.  And so, that was another, another milestone that was, that was very important in making me push forward as I went on into senior high school [George S. Middleton High School, Tampa, Florida].
Story_ID: 356261
Speaker 1: Now, what did you like to do for fun when you were growing up?  Did you listen to a lot of radio, or it was television, or did you--music or--?
Speaker 2: I liked, I liked music, but I liked to play cards a lot.  I played checkers and dominos, fly kites.  I liked to play basketball, just all those kinds of things, just had a lot of energy then, and liked to do them, liked to go for wiener roasts.  You know, our parents would let us go with the Y-Teens and with the YWCA [Young Women's Christian Association].  I loved going to the Sunday school conventions, the, you know, we would be able to go over to Bradenton [Florida] and Palmetto [Florida], and spend the week during the summertime.  I, I just loved the Sunday school conventions.  I was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now, what church did you attend?
Speaker 2: I was a member of the Allen Temple A.M.E. Church [Tampa, Florida].  That's African Methodist Episcopal church.  And I still go back and attend it when I'm in Tampa [Florida].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, was the--this may seem strange, but with all the bad weather we hear about in Florida, was the weather ever a big factor down there?  Were you ever caught in a hurricane or anything?
Speaker 2: It rained a lot in certain seasons of the year.  And I could remember when it rained very hard.  We would not have to go to school, but I don't remember--I don't remember anything being destroyed when I was growing up.
Speaker 1: Well, that's good (laughter).
Speaker 2: Um-hm (laughter).
Speaker 1: I thought I'd ask (laughter).
Story_ID: 356262
Speaker 1: So where did you go to high school?
Speaker 2: I went to Middleton High School [George S. Middleton High School, Tampa, Florida], Middleton, M-I-D-D-L-E-T-O-N, High School.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, was Middleton named for a black person that you--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Well, tell us about Middleton.  Did you continue your academic success?
Speaker 2: I was the valedictorian again when I finished Middleton High School.  I was very active in social clubs, the Zenoads [ph.], a group of like-minded women.  We were in this organization, and we had a teacher who was our sponsor.  I was a member of the debating team.  I was a member of the marching band, just all of the kinds of activities, I was very much a, a part of them.
Story_ID: 356263
Speaker 1: Did your family discuss the Civil Rights Movement at home a lot 'cause a lot of that was in the news for the first time on a national level when you had like, Brown versus Board [Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, my daddy [Willie Lee Aldridge, Sr.] was very political.  I mean, he loved to talk politics, and him and his friends would get together.  You know, there was a local drugstore on Central Avenue [Tampa, Florida], and all the men almost stopped there on their way from work.  And they would go there, and they'd brag about their kids, or how smart they were, or how they played basketball or football, or the like.  And, of course, they talked about this, the whole social scene in terms of black-white relations and, and the like of, and they talked about that often.  In my home, we certainly talked about the Brown versus the Board of Education decision 'cause I was sitting in my civics class when the decision was passed down.  We had the radio on in the civics class.  And after that, you know, we were definitely talking about that in '55 [1955] and Rosa Parks, and all of that.  But you see, if you back-step, my dad was always one who, who was concerned about equity and equality because he, you know, his, his heroes, or his heroine, and his hero were Haile Selassie of Ethiopia, and Mary McLeod Bethune.  I mean, he thought the sun rose and set in Ms. Bethune of, who founded Bethune-Cookman College [Daytona Literary and Industrial Training School for Negro Girls; Bethune-Cookman University, Daytona Beach, Florida].  And so, he put a great deal of value on both men and women and their part in changing social conditions.
Story_ID: 356264
Speaker 1: Did he ever, or did you ever get a chance to meet Mary McLeod Bethune?
Speaker 2: Yes, I did, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Well, tell us about it, then tell us (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I was ver-, very, very impressed with her.  I mean, she's a very, she was a very impressive woman, you know, full-bodied, you know, you just felt her strength when you were in her presence--
Speaker 1: Well, how did you meet her?
Speaker 2: --and the way she talked.
Speaker 1: Tell us about when you met her and what was (unclear).
Speaker 2: Well, I met her in Daytona Beach [Florida].  And, you know, because we would travel.  My parents [Mary Ellen Bennett Aldridge and Willie Lee Aldridge, Sr.] would try to give us short vacations and the like.  And I traveled to Bethune-Cookman College [Bethune-Cookman University] in Daytona Beach, um-hm, and so that's how I met her there.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, tell us about, tell us what happened that day.
Speaker 2: Oh, you know, she was there on campus.  And, and I was with a group of students and we were visiting.  And, of course, she welcomed us and talked to us briefly--inspiring us (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) See, some people don't do that though, just because they're the big icon, they don't do that.
Speaker 2: Yeah, but she, but not, but not, not her, you know, she was a people's person.  And so, you know, anybody who go and found a school with what she had to found one with, you have to know they, there's tremendous, she was a tremendous spirit.  She really--
Speaker 1: So, she talked to you all and, and--
Speaker 2: Yes, um-hm.
Speaker 1: So now, how old were you when you met her?
Speaker 2: Now, I was in, in junior high [Booker T. Washington Junior High School, Tampa, Florida] then, um-hm, so just in the beginnings.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: And she passed--I guess, in the, in the late '60s [1960s], I guess [sic. 1955]?  Right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Story_ID: 356265
Speaker 1: But I can tell you one thing, having met her, and having had all these impressive teachers that I had--oh, I didn't tell you about one of the, the teachers that was the most impress-, impressive to me.  And (laughter), we, we, we were all, all very afraid of this teacher, Ms. Barry [ph.].  She's the English teacher, and she sort of remind you, physical assemblage of Ms. Bethune [Mary McLeod Bethune].  But she was so strict, so poised, so good in her field.  And she was leaving the class one day, and she wanted someone to take over, and be at the desk to oversee the class while she stepped out, and she left that to me.  She called me up, and let me take over the class, et cetera, and gave me her keys.  And I dropped her keys, and it fell apart, you know, the key chain.  I said, oh, my God, I can't have this happen.  And so, I found a piece of chewing gum, and stuck the key back together before she came 'cause I could dare, having broken her key (laughter), her key ring, and gave it back to her.  But we, we, we really held her in great, great awe, and respect, and admiration, and fear.  She, she was a very impressionable woman.
Speaker 2: And she taught at Booker T [Booker T. Washington Junior High School, Tampa, Florida]?
Speaker 1: She taught, she taught at Middleton [George S. Middleton High School, Tampa, Florida]--
Speaker 2: Middleton, okay, the high school, okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) at my high school, my high school.
Speaker 2: All right.  Do you have any other memories about Mary McLeod Bethune?
Speaker 1: No, I can't really think (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Did she look like you expected her to look or did she--
Speaker 1: Yeah, she looked just like I expected her to look.  Oh, I, I veered a bit.  I haven't had all these teachers and the like--you would think that I wanted to be a teacher.  In fact, that I ended up being a university professor, I never, ever wanted to be a teacher.  And I had always said I would never be a teacher.  I would be anything, but a teacher because that's the only thing I ran into among black women were teachers.  And I wanted to be something different.  I wanted to go in another direction.  And then, I end up being a teacher.
Story_ID: 356266
Speaker 1: Well, who were your heroes when you were growing up?  Who did you idolize, or did you idolize anybody in particular?
Speaker 2: Well, I guess, my momma [Mary Ellen Bennett Aldridge], and my daddy [Willie Lee Aldridge, Sr.], and my grandmamma, my, my maternal grandmother, Sherry B. George, Sherry Bennett George [ph.], who later got married--my mommy's mother.  I, I guess I, I kind of idolized them, very simple people, my, my grandmother, but yet, such a, such a princess, and the way she treated me in terms of, she thought I was so important to her.  I was so precious to her.  And, and the kinds of, of, of the direction she would give us such as, you know, in front of, in front of the houses on one of the streets [in Tampa, Florida], there was no grass.  There was just the sand, and she would get out on the other side of the sidewalk.  This wasn't our house--it was my grandmother's house.  And she would sweep the dirt, and would not allow for a piece of paper to be in front of her house, and then would have the lilies growing up.  And she said, always said, it is not a shame, it is not a shame to be poor, but it is a shame to be nasty.  Nobody has a right to be nasty.  You can clean, and you can make whatever you have as best as you can make it.  And, and I have never been able to get beyond--you do the best you can with what you have, and make it better than it was.  And I, so I would have to say, my greatest hero would be my grandmother.
Story_ID: 356267
Speaker 1: Now, when you were a senior in high school [George S. Middleton High School, Tampa, Florida], what were your prospects?  What did you think that you would do next?  Did you think you were--I suppose you thought you were going to college, right?
Speaker 2: Oh, I never had any doubt that I would go to college.  There was nothing else to do but to go to college when you finish high school.  That's what my mommy [Mary Ellen Bennett Aldridge] always said.  That's what my daddy [Willie Lee Aldridge, Sr.] always said.  That's what my aunts always said.  That's what everybody in my neighborhood said.  That's what all my teachers said that you're destined to go to college, so there wasn't, there was no other thought in my mind, but to go to college.  So, when I was in high school, I would be going to college.  And so, I applied to a number of colleges, and I was accepted into every college that I applied to.
Speaker 1: Okay.  At least, I mean, okay, so how did you choose, end up choosing the college?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I, I really don't even like to, to tell folk this, but people always ask me, how did you end up choosing Clark College [Clark Atlanta University] in Atlanta [Georgia]?  Well, you know, I can say all of the things that you expect.  It was in Atlanta.  It was in the heart of a black metropolis and had all the other black colleges there.  And I had friends that were going there, friends who were at Clark, friends who were at Spelman [Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia], friends who were at Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia].  I had, had some of my relatives to go to school in Atlanta.  And so, it had a good track record.  It wasn't too big a school.  It was a fairly small school and so, you wouldn't get chewed up in the numbers, all those kinds of things.  But I really decided the, the turning point for me was that I didn't have to take physical education--can you believe?  I didn't have to put shorts on my thin legs and, and prance around.
Speaker 1: Really?  That you were self-conscious about your legs and--
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I was conscious about my legs at that time.  And now, you know, hey, my legs, they're okay.  But at that time when I was in high school, I was a very thin person, very thin.  And so, I said, I don't want to have to, well, wear shorts and go to physical ed [physical education], and so all these other things were the things I told my parents, and my parents told me, and, but you know, when I saw that I didn't really--that, that was not a requirement on the book, that was, that was kind of the turning point.  I thought about Howard University [Washington, D.C.], been accepted there, Tuskegee [Tuskegee Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama], yang-yang, but that's how I ended up going to Clark.  And that was the best move I could have ever made.  I had a wonderful, wonderful four years at Clark College.
Story_ID: 356268
Speaker 1: The people just, they, they, it was such a nurturing, challenging institution.  When I got to Clark [Clark College; Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia], every other person was a valedictorian or salutatorian.  I'm the third person in that class, so it, my class of 1959, it was an extraordinary class at Clark.  And the competition was--it was fierce, and, you know, I love a challenge and so, it just, I played on, I loved that competition that was exemplified in the classroom, and what we did in social activities, and the like.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now, tell us a little bit about Clark.  Now, Clark's a historically black college [HBCU] and the complex was Atlanta U [Atlanta University; Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia] and Morris Brown [Morris Brown College, Atlanta, Georgia], Spelman [Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia], right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, well, Clark, well, Clark, Clark, Clark College is a historically black institution, and it is now--when I was there, it was Clark College.  It is now Clark Atlanta University when the two schools came together as one in 1988.  Atlanta University having been a graduate school, and Clark having been an undergraduate school, and it combined in 1988, but it was an undergraduate school that was co-ed [co-educational].  It's in the heart of Atlanta University Center [Atlanta University Center Consortium, Atlanta, Georgia], having moved from its original location, and it's in the heart of Atlanta University Center.  So, you had access to all of the schools.  I took courses on all of the campuses.  I knew kids on all of the campuses.  And some of my friends and I were part of the Civil Rights Movement from the different campuses.
Story_ID: 356269
Speaker 1: You're in Atlanta [Georgia], this is in 19-, it's '59 [1959] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Fifty-nine [1959], '59 [1959] to '63 [1963].
Speaker 1: It's '59 [1959], right, right, okay.  So, what were the--I know that Atlanta was still segregated in those days, and there was, so, tell, what happened?  What were the key issues here in Atlanta, and how did you get involved in the Civil Rights Movement at Clark [Clark College; Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia]?
Speaker 2: Well, I had a student government president, Benjamin Brown, and he sort of took me under his tutelage.  He saw a leadership potential and so, he mentored me, and I became a part of the politics that was going on at that time.  And he, being the student government president, brought me along, and because of him and because I did not want things to change, and I, not having been a part of them, that I became a part of the Civil Rights Movement, and went to jail as did so many, many other folk go.  I was never, you know, a leader of anything in the movement.  I did all the small things.  I made flyers, I stuffed envelopes, did whatever needed to be done as a foot soldier in the movement.  But it was a great training ground for moving into a leadership role.  It helped build one's self-confidence, and allowed one to meet so many people, including Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.].  But at that time, Dr. King was a young person, and so while I admired him greatly, I didn't have a, a conception of how great he would become at that point, and how great he is today in retrospect.  But I admired him at that time as a young man, as a, as a leader of the Civil Rights Movement.  But, of course, there was Malcolm [Malcolm X].  And Malcolm came to one of the meetings in Atlanta and got a chance to not get to know him, but to see him.  And I guess during the time when I was in college, probably the folk that I most admired was president Benjamin E. Mays, who was at Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia], because he was such an orator.  And I would go to chap-, chapel over at Morehouse once a week when he was speaking because we were required to go to chapel when I was in college.  There was no getting around that.  You could lose credit hours and not graduate, had you not gone to the, the chapels as you were supposed to have gone.  But Benjamin Mays, he, he was someone that I admired tremendously.
Story_ID: 379463
Speaker 1: Tell us a little bit about the--now, now, did you, was there a local chapter of SCLC [Southern Christian Leadership Conference], or how did the students organize themselves at the Atlanta University Complex [Atlanta University Center Consortium, Atlanta, Georgia], or at Clark [Clark College; Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia], or, you know (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That, that was the organization.  We, we had the Atlanta [Georgia], the, the Atlanta Constituency--Consortium of different representatives from different schools.  And there was a coordinating committee, Atlanta University coordinating committee [Committee on Appeal for Human Rights] that existed.  And it was made up of the presidents of the student government associations, as well as students who were a part of the movement--very, very active group of folk that were involved in, in the coordinating of the activities, the president from Atlanta University, the one from Spelman [Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia], from Morris Brown [Morris Brown College, Atlanta, Georgia], from Clark.
Speaker 1: So, the students formed a coalition of activists then (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm, yes, right.
Speaker 1: --with the goal of--
Speaker 2: With, with the goal of, of bringing some changes in Atlanta, and breaking down segregation barriers in Atlanta, and particularly in the stores, the downtown shopping areas, and the like.  That's what we targeted and the restaurants.
Speaker 1: Rich's Department Store [Atlanta, Georgia]--
Speaker 2: Rich's Department Store; the restaurant [Pickrick Cafeteria, Atlanta, Georgia] that was owned by the former governor, Lester Maddox, that one I remember most when I was dragged from the counter by my hair.  And that, that one, I, I do remember a lot.
Speaker 1: You were part of a group that attempted to integrate Lester Maddox's restaurant (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, right, right.  I was a part of that, that group, and we were taken away for breaking and entering--trespassing law.  And so, we were placed in jail, and stayed there that time for two weeks, and came out only when Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] came to the jail.  I think he came several times.  But he came on that Monday afternoon, and told us that there was no longer any need for us to stay there because they had gotten an agreement that we would be able to, to now participate in these restaurants, in these establishments.  Now, prior to him coming, we had already decided--the students--that we weren't coming out until the changes took place.  And we were told by the administrators in the Atlantic University Center that if we were not back in classes that week, that we would be dropped from the rolls because we would have missed too many days for class, of class, to be able to complete the semester.  And most of us--I think all of us decided that we would just stay there until changes took place.  And that was when King came into jail, and said that something had been worked out, and that our--we were, we had been successful.
Story_ID: 379464
Speaker 1: I remember writing my mother [Mary Ellen Bennett Aldridge] a letter when I was in jail and telling her I regret that I was, that, that, that I would have wasted her money because we would not be able to continue in school if we were not out.  And I had no intentions of coming out until we had achieved what we wanted to.
Speaker 2: Now, this is a tough situation, isn't it, 'cause here you got your, your mother's money you're talking about (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yes, yes.
Speaker 2: You're talking about a commitment to a change--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --that had never occurred in this way before?
Speaker 1: Right, right, right.  But, but I don't know, it, it--and, and I was young then.  I was, I was a sophomore [at Clark College; Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia], just becoming a sophomore, but my feelings were that if I was not a part of this to help in the change, that I would have no right to be the beneficiary of change, were it to occur.  And in my dormitory room, I just made that decision that I was going to be a part.  I was going to be involved.  I was doing whatever I needed to do under the leadership of the group [Committee on Appeal for Human Rights] that I mentioned.  And so, I did.  And, and it was interesting 'cause my mother wrote me a letter back while I was there, and said, "You have to do what you have to do, and don't worry about the money.  We'll find some more somewhere for you to go back to school again."
Speaker 2: So, you had their support?
Speaker 1: Oh, yes, yes, I had their support.
Speaker 2: I know that made a difference.
Speaker 1: It made a difference because I was on a, a full tuition, room and board scholarship.  And for me not to be able to come back, and then not have that, that would have, that would have been, you know, very crushing because the monies that my parents provided were very limited funds that they had to provide, you know, for clothing, and for recreational activities, and my travel back and forth.  But the bulk of the money was paid for by the scholarship that I had.
Story_ID: 379465
Speaker 1: I think I asked you off camera that--did the Atlanta complex [Atlanta University Center Consortium, Atlanta, Georgia] presidents address the students at once about this, or did they--how did they get the--because they, they were not in favor of students participating in the civil rights demonstrations.  I know that from reading history, but how did they get the message across to you all?  Did they--
Speaker 2: Well, we, we were sent, we had written communication that was delivered to us in the jail, telling us that if we were not back that, in fact, we would have lost our place within the universities so that, that was how we were apprised of, of their positions.  Now, that was--I don't think that was uniformly, though, because President Mays [Benjamin Mays] took somewhat of a different stance, I think.  He was more supportive than were the other presidents in the center.  And you, you also got to understand that while this was the general flavor, the general tenor, that there were many faculty that were supportive.  And I, I would f-, I, I, would have to attribute my success during that year to one of my professors, Sara Cureton [Sara H. Cureton], who's my Spanish professor [at Clark College; Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia].  She saw that all of my books and all of my assignments were brought to me in jail, so that I could keep up and I was able to keep up.  In fact, I think that was the one year that I made a B in my classes when I was out those two weeks.
Speaker 1: It--this is a Spanish class professor, right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 379466
Speaker 1: Was that the biggest demonstration you were a part of, the one in Lester Maddox's--what was the name of his restaurant anyway?  Do you remember (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I think it was a Pickrick's [Pickrick Cafeteria, Atlanta, Georgia], Pick-, Pickrest, or something of that nature.  I don't, I don't know if I even remember it now.  I kind of blurred it out.
Speaker 1: Had he passed the axe handles out during that time, or I remember the image on the news of him passing axe handles out--
Speaker 2: Uh-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: --to the good ole boys to--
Speaker 2: Right, right.  Yeah, that was--
Speaker 1: --hit the demonstrators in the head with it.
Speaker 2: Right, that part of, but I, I guess, I also remember being spit on, and that, those are memories that you will never forget.
Speaker 1: So, you all basically went into the restaurant, had a seat at the counter?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: And then--
Speaker 2: Were pulled up, and jerked out, carted out.
Speaker 1: Did you surprise, did you surprise Maddox?  Did he suspect that you all were coming or--
Speaker 2: I, I, I'm not, I'm not sure whether he did or not, but I know he did not want us to be there (laughter), did not want us to be there, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Can you remember the looks on people's faces when you came in to sit-in?
Speaker 2: Well, they were very surprised, surprised looks, you know, how dare you be in here?  This is not your place to be.  It's--I guess, pretty much the same kinds of looks--not, not angry looks, not in anger, but just, you have no right to be here.  What are you doing here?  Much of what I experienced in the five and ten cents stores that we would call Kresge's [S.S. Kresge Company] or Kress [S.H. Kress Company] when I was in high school [George S. Middleton High School, Tampa, Florida].  And we would go in there.  And if you picked up something, and thought you were going to try on somebody's, try on the clothes, you know, you didn't try on any clothes.  Whatever you got, you bought it--it was yours in those stores 'cause there was no dressing rooms for you to try on clothes.  And you know that you didn't go to those counters when you were in, when I was in high school.  You know that you didn't drink from the water fountain that had white on it.  You drank from the one that had colored on it, except I had a friend, who name, Alton White [ph.].  And we were in there, and so he drank from the white fountain.  And somebody came up to him and said, "Boy, do you know you're drinking from the wrong fountain?"  And he said, "Oh, no, it has my name on it.  I thought it was especially put there for me," (laughter), 'cause his name was White, so he drank from it.  But, anyway, so when you, when you, when you think about what happened in Atlanta [Georgia] during the civil, during, during the movement, you remember that these faces were ones of surprise and saying, well, what are you doing here?

Speaker 1: Now, what was your major at Clark [Clark College; Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia]?
Speaker 2: I had a double major in social science, with a specialty in sociology, and one in Spanish, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  And any other memories from Clark that you really--did, now, did you know, did you ever meet Ella Baker, and Bob Moses [Robert Parris Moses], or any of the people that came?
Speaker 2: Well, I, I don't recall Ella Baker.  I do remem-, re-, re-, recall Queen Mother Moore.  Oh, yes, she came to Atlanta [Georgia], and that was really a treat to, to meet her.
Speaker 1: Now, tell us who she is.  Who's Queen Mother Moore?  Some people (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, Queen Mother Moore, out of New York [New York], and she was one of the champions of the Civil Rights Movement.  And we just adored her and the stance that she took on, on equal rights--equity.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I think she's with the Center for Black Education [Washington, D.C.], I think.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, out of New York [sic. Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 1: Yeah, right--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --right, okay.  So, '63 [1963], and you said Malcolm X came down to speak?  True?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, he did, yes, at one time.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I didn't meet him, but I saw him.
Speaker 1: Now, that was when he, was he still with the Nation of Islam then or had he--
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: I later got to know his wife, Betty Shabazz, very well.  Well, in fact, had her come to Emory [Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia] to speak.
Story_ID: 379468
Speaker 1: Now, you graduated [from Clark College; Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia] in '63 [1963]--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And then you, you stayed here in the complex [Atlanta University Center Consortium, Atlanta, Georgia], and went to Atlanta U [Atlanta University; Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia] to get a master's degree, right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, no, I didn't.
Speaker 1: No?
Speaker 2: Actually, after I graduated, I went to Fort Pierce, Florida, and became a social worker there with the Department of Public Welfare, and worked there for a year, and decided that I did not have the skills I thought I needed to work with my constituency.  So, I decided to come back to the Atlanta University School of Social Work [Whitney M. Young Jr. School of Social Work, Atlanta, Georgia].  Now, it wasn't that I, I didn't handle my caseloads.  I--my--I would see more clients than three or four of the other social workers combined because I had a commitment to them.  And they were all blacks that I saw and I just made, I made it a point of going to see them more than one time.  I would go two or three times.  I would try to get other things, trying and getting them, get them involved in training and education, not just to see whether they qualify for a check.  And I felt that if I had more skills, I would be able to do more.  So, I decided to come back to the School of Social Work to get a master's degree.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So, so, you got a master's degree in social work?
Speaker 2: Yes, in social work--
Speaker 1: All right, okay.  That's, that's the--
Speaker 2: --at Atlanta University (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: --um-hm.
Story_ID: 379469
Speaker 1: Any of the teachers before we--you know, at Atlanta U [Atlanta University; Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia] or Clark [Clark College; Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia] that stand out as outstanding teachers in social science?
Speaker 2: Well, I, I think Dr. Sweat [Edward F. Sweat], Avery Burris [ph.]--they, they were just excellent teachers, just excellent.  And, and, in fact, and Dr. Wiley Bolden, very important people for me.  And, again, you know, very--they were very supportive of me, and in terms of tutoring, in terms of counseling me in, in directions that I needed to go, the kinds of courses I needed.  And I spent time with Dr. Wiley Bolden in his wife's home, and they have made, we maintained a relationship since then.  He was at my wedding, so they, these were very important figures there.  But having a small school, you got to know folk across the disciplines.  It wasn't like you would just know people in the sociology or social science, or just in psychology, or history.  You know people across the board, and that's what made it so good about a small school.  You knew so many of the students in all class levels at the small school.
Story_ID: 379470
Speaker 1: Sixty-six [1966] was like--I guess, the beginning of the Black Power movement, I guess (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --in a lot of ways in the early days--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --of the Black Power movement.  What was going on in Atlanta [Georgia] in those days?  Had it changed since you had been away or--?
Speaker 2: Well, At-, Atlanta, I, I can't think so much of the, of the, the movement, the mo-, the motion going on here between 1964, '66 [1966] when I was in the School of Social Work [Atlanta University School of Social Work; Whitney M. Young Jr. School of Social Work, Atlanta, Georgia].  And, and keeping in mind, I had to do my internship--one of them here in Atlanta, which was at the Fulton County Department of Welfare.  And then, the following year, I was at the greater Cincinnati family service center in Cincinnati [Ohio] for the year.  So, I was away from Atlanta part of that time for that year.  So, I don't, I don't have a sense of a great deal of motion going on in, in Atlanta.  Much of my contact was working in my, in, in my internships and on, on the campus.
Speaker 1: Did you, as a young graduate in social work--I mean, did you really, were you able to see what you learned in school as applicable in the field, or did it--I mean, did you, did it seem to work?  I mean--
Speaker 2: Well, one of the good things about having gone to the Atlanta University School of Social Work is that it was one of the most prominent in the nation at the time that I went to school there.  And they were grounded in integrating theory with practice.  So that, yes, the theory, the book learning was well-suited, well-adapting for what we had to do on the ground.  And then you had a person, who supervised you in your placement setting, to make sure that you were able to integrate what you had learned in the classroom with what was happening on the ground.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: And that's, that's what I, I think, when I think of social work.  I think of it as having theory and methodology, but having that experiential base, so that you can go out.  And you actually meet folk on the ground where they are, or if you're involved in community organizations, with groups, or group therapy, all of that, that, yes, I would have to say that it was a tremendous foundation for what I wanted to do.
Story_ID: 379471
Speaker 1: What I have here is that in 1967, you went to the University of Ireland at Dublin [National University of Ireland at Dublin, Dublin, Ireland] to study.  Now, how did that come about?  Is that right?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Well, you know, in, in 1966, after I finished Atlanta University School of Social Work [Whitney M. Young Jr. School of Social Work, Atlanta, Georgia], I went back as the associate director of the Tampa Urban League [Tampa, Florida], where Benjamin Mays had been, and set up any number of programs there.  I was only there for a short stint of time before I was offered a Merrell Fellowship [William S. Merrell Fellowship] to study and travel abroad.  And I decided I would take it.  I thought it would be just more training under my belt, that it would give me a broader perspective.  So, I took this, and I went to the University of Ireland in Dublin [Ireland].  I chose to go to the University of Ireland, rather than to the London School of Economics [London School of Economics and Political Science, London, England], or to a school in France, or Germany, because Ireland had, as its national language, English, even though Gaelic is, is the, the, the language of, of origin.  But they had English, and I knew I could speak fluently.  And I thought that Dublin would have a slower pace than London, so that's why I chose to go to the University of Ireland in Dublin.  But while I was there, getting a degree, a postgraduate degree in child psychology, I also was establishing training seminars for folk in social work because there were only sixty professionally trained social workers in Ireland when I went there.  And so, I was met the day after I got there by the bishop of Ireland, and asked if I would participate in training, and with the president of the University of Ireland, so I had extraordinary experiences.  You know, I never even dreamed I would have these kinds of experiences.  So, I began to train social workers all over Ireland.  And I would spend weekends in different areas of the country, and would take classes during the week, while also working as a full-time social worker at the St. John of God Brothers Child Guidance Clinic [Dublin, Ireland].
Speaker 1: Now, that's incredible to think--I mean, Ireland, you know, I guess in those days--I mean, I think that most people would agree they have a lot of social issues and only how many--
Speaker 2: Professionally trained, you know, with master's degrees.
Speaker 1: There were only six-, you said--
Speaker 2: There were, there were something like sixty.
Speaker 1: Sixty?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm.  And, and it's also interesting about that is that Nuala Duggan [ph.] and Mary Macavotti [ph.] were Irish social workers.  They were trained in the United States, and they were trained at Florida State University [Tallahassee, Florida], but they did their internship work at the Fulton County Department of Public Welfare.  And that's where I was doing mine, and I met them there.  And when I got to Ireland, I didn't even know that they had gone back there.  And I was walking down the hall in one of the buildings on campus at the University of Ireland, and ran into Mary Macavotti.  She said, "Ah." She's been a professor at the University of, of Ireland, and then Nuala came back to the country, and these were my two cohorts.  These were one of my, my two colleagues for the rest of the time I was in Ireland.  We did all of our social gatherings, and I mean they got me located in a good place to stay, and all of that, so it was just, you know, providential.
Story_ID: 379472
Speaker 1: Were there parallels between the condition of the Irish in Ireland, and the black people here in the United States and--?
Speaker 2: Well, the difference is you, you're not dealing with the race thing in Ireland.  In fact, so many people have never even seen a black person in Ireland.  And when people from the countryside would come to the child guidance center, you know, one kid tried to rub the--my--the color off my skin because he said, "Ooh, ooh."  And then I said, "Well, you can't rub it off, Liam [ph.]," and, and he just started smiling at it.  And I had one woman come in, and she just looked at me and she came, and she wouldn't say a thing, and I was the intake social worker.  And she came, and she started patting my hair.  She said, "You're beautiful, beautiful, beautiful."  Then she sit down, and we went right on into her, telling me her problems and issues and all.  But they hadn't seen black folk, folk who lived in the country lands, and would come in for treatment at the center.  Now, in terms of, of Ireland, to get back to the fact that race wasn't, was not as much of an issue.  There weren't that many black people.  I didn't see another black person, for example, for six months, my first six months there.  What was it, what you saw in, in Ireland was a lot of alcoholism.  But you also saw was a lot of, of psychosis, as opposed to neurosis, but you also saw was the tremendous gaps, strati-gaps, stratification gaps, class gaps, people who had, and people who didn't have.  But what was interesting to me is that the people who had were not as discernible as here from those who didn't have.  The difference would be in quality of clothing, for example, or quality of a car, or having a car.  My friends, who were medical doctors at St. John of God Brothers [St. John of God Brothers Child Guidance Clinic, Dublin, Ireland], they would have very expensive coats, and very nice scarves and shoes, but not a lot of them, maybe two, and that, two really, really good leather bags, and leather pairs of shoes when the folk who didn't have, would have much lesser quality in terms of what they had to wear.  And the folk who had money, they would go to the theater.  They would go to plays.  They would travel on weekends.  And people who didn't weren't able to do those kinds of things.  So, it was quality of life that was very different, not ostentatious display--quality.  And you could tell that in terms of those who had, and those who didn't have.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So, you stayed in Ireland for (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Almost two years.
Speaker 1: --almost two years?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That's a long time.  Now, did you get a chance to come back and forth any?
Speaker 2: Well, I didn't have any desire to come back (laughter).  As a matter of fact, I had a great deal of difficulty returning to the United States.  Given all of the turmoil that had gone on here, and the like, and given the kind of treatment that I received when I was there, which is contrary to what I was told, and what people would have thought that, you know, those Irish folk.  And they, you know, you're not going to be treated well, and they're racist because they're thinking about Boston [Massachusetts] and different places.  And I was just treated like a little princess.  It, it, it was a just a wonderful, wonderful experience for me being there.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's a, there have been books written about that, and about the difference in Irish and Ireland, and here, you know (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm, um-hm.
Story_ID: 379473
Speaker 1: What brought you back [from Ireland to the United States]?
Speaker 2: I came back and went to help in founding, or situating the first comprehensive mental health center in the nation in a general hospital.  That's when the mental health movement was really getting in full stride in the '60s [1960s]--the latter part of the '60s [1960s].  And so, again, the challenges that I like, that was a challenge.  I'd gone over there and trained folk, et cetera.  So now, I would come back, and go to this first comprehensive mental health center [Comprehensive Community Mental Health Center] in a general hospital [Winter Haven Hospital] down in Winter Haven, Florida, so that's what I did.  I went there as the acting chief of social work--of social services, and had a really good year there, helping to set up the place, set the standards, and the like, and probably would have stayed there, except that I didn't have a doctorate, or a Ph.D. in front or behind my name.  And it, it just sort of did not spend well with me for me to be the intake worker, and to get all of the presented information and the like, and then walk into the room with the general counsel, the, the general committee, the mental health committee, and everybody turn to the medical doctor, Dr. So and So, whose name at that time, you know, it was Anderson [ph.].  And I have gotten all the work.  I'm the one who diagnosed the case and, yet, it was as though I was not to be acknowledged.  And I just said, well, you know, something is wrong with this show.  Maybe I'd better go get a doctorate in algology, or some kind of -ology that I can have that kind of a title to go along with the knowledge base.  And so, it was at that point I decided that I would leave, and that I would go to a university and get a Ph.D.
Story_ID: 355534
Speaker 1: You decide to work on your master's degree, is that right?
Speaker 2: Yeah--no, Ph.D.
Speaker 1: Ph.D., that's right--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --Ph.D., all right.  I'm sorry, yeah.  And so, where did you go for your Ph.D.?
Speaker 2: I went to Purdue, Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana, yes.
Speaker 1: Now, why did you choose Purdue?
Speaker 2: Well, I had thought of a number of schools, and had been accepted into all of them that I applied for, but I had a couple of friends that were at Purdue at the time.  And I decided to go to Purdue because of that and because of the financial backing that I received to go there.  See, I've never spent a dime to go to school really.  I've always been able to get (laughter) scholarships and whatever.
Speaker 1: That's probably good advice for young people--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --who want to go to school--go to the school that'll give you some money, right.
Speaker 2: Well, that, that's good, that's good advice because, you know, most of the schools, if they're accredited, they're going to train you, and so you'll become credentialed.
Speaker 1: That's right, okay.
Story_ID: 355535
Speaker 1: How did you like Purdue [Purdue University] in West Lafayette [Indiana]?
Speaker 2: Purdue, well, well, you see when I went to Purdue, I already w-, had a degree, already had training in that.  At that time, to have a master's degree in social work, you almost--that was almost the terminal degree.  Since that time, we've change-, the, the field has changed (unclear) I have a terminal degree.  So, I went there very confident, and knowing that I didn't have to stay there.  I could leave, get a job.  And so, when you go in with an attitude that you, you know, you already have something in your suitcase that you can use.  I went there confident, enjoyed being at Purdue.  It was a very challenging place to be because the sociology department, which is what I went into it, was very much quantitatively-oriented.  And so, we spent a great deal on statistics and, and quantitative methodology, et cetera, as compared to a lot of the qualitative, which was what I had gotten a great deal from social work.  But it was, it was, it was a challenging experience.  And I can say I, I enjoyed it because when I went into my first statistics class, I remember being told by my statistics professor that, "Oh, you're coming with a master's degree in, in social work.  You're going to have a difficult time in this class."  And I'm the only black person sitting up in there also.  So, I said, "Okay."  And so, when I got my first exam back, and I looked at those, the grade I got on the exam.  And I put my hand up, and I said, "Dr. Potter [Harry R. Potter]?"  He said, "Yes, Delores [HistoryMaker Delores P. Aldridge]?"  I said, "I think you made a mistake on my paper.  I don't think you graded it correctly."  And he said, "Well, what do you mean?"  I said, "I couldn't possibly have made ninety-eight out of a hundred, could I?  I was not supposed to be able to make it in this class."  And so, he just laughed and laughed, and that was the beginning of a very good friendship.  And some five, six years ago when he was president of the North Central Sociological [North Central Sociological Association] meeting, I was asked to come and give the keynote address, the plenary address there.  And I mentioned that when I was talking.  And he just had the biggest laugh, as did all of the folk in the audience.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, it was good to be able to (laughter) just prove--
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Yes.
Speaker 1: --(unclear) so--
Speaker 2: Just given the chance, given opportunity, you know, I often say, if you give somebody the opportunity, let them bail themselves out, but don't close the door before you give them the chance.
Story_ID: 355536
Speaker 1: So you were at Purdue [Purdue University, West Lafayette, Indiana] until '71 [1971], I guess, yeah, something like (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, from '68 [1968] to '71 [1971].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And were there any experiences at Purdue that, 'cause, you know, you've been basically, I guess, a career in sociology--
Speaker 2: Social work, um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and African American studies.  Was there anything at Purdue that--I guess, expanded what you already, you know, were thinking about in terms of sociology, and how to approach it?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, at, at Purdue, I, I had the opportunity of meeting some very fine folk there, very fine instructors, but it was also at the point of the Vietnam War.  And so, there was still the, the Civil Rights Movement going on, the Vietnam movement.  Every night, there was action on campus, people all over the campus.  It's nation time, it's this time.  And the piecing of Vietnam and like, some of it is a lot of excitement on that, that campus, a lot of things that keep you going.  And I, and I enjoyed, enjoyed that, that excitement.  But I also was tapped by someone in the city because I would go and do volunteer work, even though I was in this full-time program.  And I was asked if I would come and consider being the head of community organization for the Greater Lafayette Community Centers [Lafayette, Indiana].  And so, I did consider it, and I did get the job.  And so, I became the director of community services for the Greater Lafayette Community Center.  And then shortly after, it was reorganized, and we had four different units with four different directors.  And then, I was asked to take over the leadership helm of the Greater Lafayette Community Centers.  And I became the executive administrator of the, of the organization, while working on my Ph.D.  I worked, did this full-time, which required you to be in everything throughout the community, you know, with bankers, with realtors, with schools, that kind of thing, as you tried to galvanize and mobilize activities and funds, and the like for those centers there.  So, I, I did a lot of things when I was there.  And that just put me on a trajectory.  And then, I was also working with the Indiana Commission on Human Relations, which was race relations oriented, to work through some of the problems in the State of Indiana, and headed up that commission.  So, I was doing a lot of things while I was working on this doctorate.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You realize a lot of people say that Indiana is like Mississippi North or something--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: --but did you find that to be true when you were in Indiana?
Speaker 2: I, I find that Indiana was, you know, not a New York (laughter), okay.  But because of the nature of what I was doing, I expected to have confrontations, to run into difficulty, 'cause when you're working for those who don't have, then you're going to have that, that divide there.  But, overall, I met with a great deal of success there.  I was able to manage to get back then, the latter part of the '60s [1960s], something like $10 million from HUD [U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development] to finance an entirely new center, one of the, the state-of-the-art centers in West Lafayette [Indiana].  And I had to galvanize people in the community--whites, to help make that happen.  And, of course, it did happen.  And Sherry [ph.] was our board of director chairperson, and I worked very well with them.  So, I, I haven't had a great deal of problems in working across lines 'cause I expect there to be challenges.
Story_ID: 355537
Speaker 1: What brought you back to Atlanta [Georgia]?
Speaker 2: To Atlanta?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Again, I, you see, this is another thing.  I don't think I've ever applied for a job.  Somebody always has known me, and gave my name, and then the people who wanted to hire me, actually called me to consider the job.  And such was the same thing at Emory [Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia].  I was not concerned about leaving Lafayette, Indiana.  I thought I had already moved to be the executive director [of Greater Lafayette Community Centers, Lafayette, Indiana].  Things had gotten kind of cushioning.  We're going to have the money coming in, new building, well-situated in the community.  But then, I, I, I was asked, I was called by the dean of Emory College [Emory College of Arts and Sciences, Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia], and asked me if I would consider coming down, and looking at a position of African American studies director.  And it was called coordinator then.  And so, I said, "Well, this is a free trip to Atlanta.  Yes, I'll go down there."  And then, I came to Atlanta, and I met with some of these students, and some of the faculty, and the like, and saw that they, they really needed somebody to come to Emory because they, they--it just was not a diverse community here.  And there was nothing in the curriculum for the most part that reflected the experiences of a, of a university 'cause the university supposedly reflected the universe.  And this wasn't reflecting the universe.  So, they then told me after I came for the interview, et cetera, and met with students, the Black Student Alliance with overtaking a building, you know, on campus, that they would like me to consider taking the job.  So, I came back, and visited the campus again, and decided that I would take the job.  But it was, it was difficult because Emory offered me the job on one day.  And then, I sent a letter back to them.  I told them yes, and I sent a letter saying, "Yes, I'll take the job."  And the very next day, the University of Georgia [Athens, Georgia] offered me a job as the dean for the School of Social Work.  And, you know, I was caught in this ethical dilemma.  Now knowing what I know, I could have easily, have just not come to Emory--taken the job at the University of Georgia because I hadn't gone there to work.  And people do it all the time.  But, you know, going back to my background, and what's ethical, and what's right--if you already said you were going one place, and so, you can't go back on your word.  So, I came, came, came to Emory.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that has been an ongoing challenge.
Speaker 1: So, that was like thirty-five years ago?  Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Thirty-five years ago, and I came here, wasn't expecting to stay, thought I'd come here, and stay for a little while, and be gone.
Story_ID: 355538
Speaker 1: Yeah, when you look at your history, of all the other, all the things that you had accomplished, and all the places that you've been--
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: --you know, before, and it would seem logical, but what--well, what happened here?  Now, you were the founding coordinator (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Founding director--
Speaker 1: --of the black studies department.
Speaker 2: --yeah, the founding coordinator of black studies at Emory [Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia], which later became Africana, African American studies.  And now, we have two separate constituencies, an African American, and an African studies.  I came here in 1971, but I was also the first African American in the arts and sciences in the college [Emory College of Arts and Sciences, Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia], and the first African American woman in the entire university.  So, that was a challenge for a young African American woman to come to a school in the Deep South that had never had an African American woman, and had only white males in administrative positions in one of the most conservative regions of the country.  And on top of that, to establish a program for which there were no models because black studies had only begun to come on the scene in a formal way in 1968.  And this was only three years later.  So, it was, it was a tremendous challenge and, and I think that's probably what, in the final analysis, brought me here because it was a challenge.
Speaker 1: Now, did you have any idea of how to model this pro-, I mean, was there a model for this pro-, this program that you were trying (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) There were no models--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --there were no model.  But my idea, Emory offered me two thousand dollars for my, my budget.  That was not my salary--my budget--and they told me I could sit in the center of the Candler [Candler School of Theology, Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia] library building at a desk after I got here.  Well, I said, "Why, I don't think so.  I, I think that I'm going to have a suite of offices."  And they did, we did get a suite of offices.  And I took the money, and hired two people to teach two courses, rather than just simply having people to visit and give a lecture.  Because the idea was, this will ride itself out, and these students are up in arms, but after a year or two, they'll go away or fade away.  So, we'll give a little money here, and you can have a few lectures on campus to do this and the lec-, but I didn't have that image in my mind.  See, my image was that, if you're going to a university, and you're going to start an academic unit, it's going to be like all other academic units.  It's going to have faculty come in.  It's going to have secretaries.  It's going to have all of the support system.  And you're going to model it that way.  You're going to have courses through the curriculum that everybody's going to have to take, or can take.  So, that's, that was my, my model, modelling it just like everything else was modelled that was in the institution.  And it has finally become just like everything else is in the institution.
Speaker 1: Now did you have, was it, students or your allies in fighting for these things, or did you have to basically do it yourself, on, by yourself, or what?
Speaker 2: There were students.  My, my students were my allies.  And there were white students and black students.  And, and the white students, of course, you, you have to understand that when I came here, there were only thirteen black students on the entire campus, which means that for my classes to, to go for you to have a program, you had to have majority white students.  You had to have a bunch of them, 'cause I could walk across campus, and not even see a black student for days.  So, the allies were students, but they, but they were not the only allies.  There were some right-thinking white men here.  And they stood by me in the very beginning years, in terms of getting supplies, getting resources, et cetera.  And they, they are my friends until today.  There're a number of them that are my friends.  They came to my wedding, you know, I've gone to their kids' weddings, all that kind of thing.  So, there were some that, that had been by my side in good times and in bad times.
Story_ID: 355539
Speaker 1: Well, what, what were the two courses that were taught [in the black studies program at Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia]?  And then they--I mean, what, what (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) In the beginning, in the beginning, we had the course, the Dynamics of the Black Community, which is still one of the most popular courses.  Dynamics of the Black Community, when it looks at all aspects of the black community--family, religion, politics, literature, et cetera.  And then, the other was the African American History, when you go back and you chronicle from Africa up to certain periods, and then break it up.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, over the years, how did it, did it--I suppose it grew over the years from that small beginning, too, yeah.
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, oh, yes, it has grown.  It, it has, has grown into many, many courses.  And any number of professors we have, there's professors in all of the sub-areas focusing in African American studies, and we have associates and adjunct professors.  It's a departmental status, and we're now putting a proposal in for the Ph.D.
Story_ID: 355540
Speaker 1: I know in '71 [1971] it was, or there about, there was a debate about whether there was such a thing as black sociology, or black psychology, or even black history for that matter.  There had people actually debating these things, and I guess they're still doing now.  But what was your position and philosophy on that in those days?
Speaker 2: Well, I think that you have white history, you have white sociology, 'cause you take and put all of the emphasis on, on a Eurocentric perspective.  I think when you talk about black that you take it from an Africa-, African-centered perspective, from the people's lives, just as what you're doing in this documentary.  You, you're hearing it from the people's lives, the people's words.  And so, I think that when you look at the traditional disciplines, they have come from pretty much one-sided views, so that it was necessary for African Americans, along with their white allies and whoever, to say, no, there's another way of looking at the world.  There's another body of information that we need to include if we are really to be truly educated.  And I, and I think that, that's when you talk about black psychology.  This is another way of looking at interaction, psychological interaction.  You talk about black sociology.  There's another way of looking at interactions.  And when you go into a classroom, you, you know in your own personal relationship that you experience your base, your perspective.  You can only bring to the table what you know, what you have experienced.  You can't bring something that you've had no contact with, whether it's in read, whether it's new experiences, and the like.  And so, I think, you bring a different kind of perceptive, which is not to say, it is the only perspective.  It's one way of looking at the world.  And so, I think that, that, yes, there, there is a black perspective.  There is a woman's perspective, a feminist perspective.  There is a Latino perspective because of the nature of the way they have experienced the world.  And I think one of the great things about black studies is that we didn't, we gave legitimacy to all these others, you know, we are the forerunners.  Then, we get this great surge of women studies and now, we have ethnic studies and Latino studies, and et cetera.  But we broke the ground, just as black people have led the way in helping to reform or transform America.  And so, the world owed, America owes a, a debt of, of gratitude to black folk breaking so many grounds.  And this is not to say there's no room for the others.  All the other folk have value.  All the other folk perspectives ought to be there.  But we ought to always acknowledge what the Civil Rights Movement did, and what the black studies movement did--black studies being the intellectual arm of the activist, Civil Rights Movement, and thus, having as a part of its, its, its logo, its, its slogan, academic excellence, and social responsibility, that we cannot have just the academic without having responsibility.  So, we have to have them both--town and gown--in black studies.  And it's so, so interesting, you know, I, I really get caught up with this.  It's so interesting because when we came, when I came to Emory [Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia], one of the first mandates, after I got here, was that we should have an internship within the black community.  And that came from the faculty here and so, it was passed unanimously.  I never had any course, anything to go to the Emory faculty that was not passed, did not get through.  And so, we come up with the internship, but now today, thirty-five years later, there is no department that I can think of that does not have an internship component to it.  That is, getting the real world experience to integrate the theory.
Story_ID: 355541
Speaker 1: What you've said is that the Civil Rights Movement reformed how America thought about civil liberty, and even on your campus.  And your internship program pioneered what a lot of departments are doing now.  And yet, today, you can--I just had an experience like this where I sat in a social history, or social sciences class, and did not hear one black social scientist mentioned in the whole class for the whole period of time.  It was a very good class otherwise.  I mean, but weren't, so is this--I guess, what I'm leading to now--I mean, was that part of the reason that the Association of Black Sociology, yeah, Sociologists [Association of Black Sociologists] were--was formed (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, the, the, the, yeah, the, the, the National Council for Black Studies came into existence to promote, then develop black studies programs.  And there were a number of caucuses that came into existence--the caucus of black psychologists, the caucus of black anthropologists, the caucus of black sociologists.  And later, the caucus of black psychology became the Association of Black Sociology--of, of Black Psychology [Association of Black Psychologists], the Association of Black Sociologists, which is what we, we, we now have.  And the thing, the--one of the things is that you can have these courses, and not mention any other folk.  And this is as though they made no contributions, that they did nothing.  And so, there is still that great need to have these courses that focus on--one of the things I, I find, when you're in a black studies-oriented course, or if, you know, women studies-oriented course, that you come out fuller than when you're in a strictly psychology or strictly sociology class because there is a reference base that you know the focus will be on black, but you use the other as a reference because you got to understand the larger picture in order to understand how you had fit into it.  So, therefore, your worldview becomes bigger than if you were in a strict, or a traditional course, because they don't even have to acknowledge you.  They don't acknowledge you, but you would think that they would, in order that they could have a broader worldview.  And you're, you're very right that you could go into a social science class, and until a few years ago here, you can go throughout your training in sociology and get a Ph.D., and have no real knowledge about Du Bois --
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: W.E.B. Du Bois, or Oliver Cox, or James Blackwell, or [HistoryMaker] Joyce Ladner, or any of these folk.  And I now have a course at the doctoral level that focuses on theorists other than traditional white male theorists.  I focus on black, Latinos, Asian, and women theorists that they, too, bring something.  They, too, help us look at the world in a different kind of a way.
Story_ID: 355542
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's, it's interesting that we can, that universities are still teaching just the white males and the--Emile Durkheim, or Robert Burton, and all these people and that.  You never hear any black sociologists mentioned in the (laughter), you know, the--
Speaker 2: And it's interesting, even at the, at the American sociological level, that we have this major war--Du Bois [W.E.B. Du Bois], Frazier [E. Franklin Frazier], Johnson [Charles S. Johnson], you had to take three giants and, and wrap it into one award.  But recently, there was this big petition to move the Lifetime Achievement Award to be called the W.E.B. Du Bois Award for Lifetime Achievement [sic. W.E.B. Du Bois Career Award of Distinguished Scholarship].
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: But we still have a long way to go, we have a long way to go, in terms of integrating so much of what other folk have brought to the plate.  And so many of the theories these folk came out with them before some of the newer generation, and they don't even make any, you know, any mention of them of where they got their grounding from.
Speaker 1: So, you have to kind of go, kind of clean and sort these things out, and re-educate people, I guess, a lot of what--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I, I do a lot of thing, I do a lot of P-, PR [public relations] for Emory [Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia] on so many levels.  And for the first twenty years I was here, there was nothing significant--no committee or anything really significant that I was not a part of, and have continued.  In the latter years, you know, I still do things all the time.  And I'm introducing the black, the, the 'Eyes on the Prize' 'cause Emory is a major sponsor for that, and any number of other things, but don't, you know, I, I don't have to do as much as I once had to do because we have other good folk here, excellent folk here, who are able to take up some of that slack and do some of that.  And so, I find myself trying to move away, and to wean off, and to prepare for my exit.
Story_ID: 356281
Speaker 1: Yeah, let's talk about your publications.  Now, you've written quite a bit.  As you mentioned a few minutes ago, you volunteered for almost every committee.  I--there's a list, I was reading list after list of committees that you sat on (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I sit on over two thousand committees here and throughout, oh, various professional organizations.  I've been president of four national organizations.  And, you know, on four separate occasions, chaired all kinds of committees, et cetera, et cetera, consulted in over two thousand--I guess, groups in federal government, et cetera, given over two thousand public lectures, et cetera, et cetera.  But I think that in terms of publications--
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: Okay, all right.
Speaker 1: You know, as we were saying, publications, not having had a mentor, academic mentor when I came to Emory [Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia], publications were not high on my list.  What was high on my list was institution building, building, building units, building an academic unit, but got very much involved in a number of professional organizations, and ended up being president of these organizations, and sitting on so many committees, over two thousand of them, as I said.
Story_ID: 356282
Speaker 1: You were twice president of the National Association of Black (unclear) [sic. National Council of Black Studies] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, I was unprecedented, two-term elected president because I brought in a lot of money there.  And I set some new directives, new workshops, et cetera, 'cause again, you know, my whole thing is whenever you're doing anything, you want to add something to it, make something better about it.  And so, I, I did an enormous amount of work.  I went all over the country for, to black studies programs that were having problems, and spoke with presidents of universities, et cetera.  So, I spent all that time, while trying to build the one here [Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia], and trying to, to write, and the like.  So, you, you just spend enormous amount, amount of time doing all kinds of things.  But I published, I guess, over a hundred, a hundred fifty pieces of stuff, and a number of monographs, a number of books, many articles, had many editorials, like in the Chicago Tribune, the Tampa Tribune, and the USA Today, et cetera, The Irish Times, the, those kinds of things.  I, I think that a couple of my, my more important works are the ones that deal with male-female relations.  A couple of volumes are there.  I think that the works that deal with women, and the economic marketplace, and how we fare are, are quite good.  I think the works I've done on engendering Africana studies, or engendering African American studies are very important.
Story_ID: 356283
Speaker 1: I think my last book that was co-edited with Carlene Young, 'Out of the Revolution' ['Out of the Revolution: The Development of Africana Studies,' ed. Delores P. Aldridge and Carlene Young] is, is, is a profound kind of a volume in that it was the first time ever that two women in the field dared to pull together a volume of that magnitude.  And what we did, we tried to chronicle the whole development of, of, of the field of African American studies, Africana studies, and to look at component parts of it, to lift how many programs we had, and how we had grown.  So, I think it's, it's, it's a powerful piece of work.  And it has some of the leading figures, who were the leaders at the very beginning of the movement of, for black studies in the early '70s [1970s], who have chapters in the book.  We now have lots of good scholars, but at the beginning, these folk were not there.  They, they were, they were tee-, they, they were little children at that point, growing, but I have those folk.  Carlene and I got those folk who have been there, and who were there at the beginning of the movement to write (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Who are--
Speaker 1: --and to include.
Speaker 2: Yeah, who would you consider--
Speaker 1: Like--
Speaker 2: --the pioneers of Africana studies?
Speaker 1: Well, I think that there are number of people who, as pioneers of Africana studies.  But I would certainly have to put [HistoryMaker] Nathan Hare in there.  I would certainly have to put Lenny Jeffries [Leonard Jeffries].  And, certainly, James Turner at Cornell [Cornell University, Ithaca, New York], Jim Stewart [James B. Stewart] at Penn State [Pennsylvania State University, University Park, Pennsylvania].  And, of course, I started the first program in the entire South at Emory [Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia], and then became president [of National Council of Black Studies], and all these other things.  So, I guess I would have to put myself in there as one of the pioneers, and one of the few women who has managed to maintain prominence.  And if you--we have lots of black women who are doing women's studies, who are doing literature, et cetera, but they don't necessarily identify with the field of Africana studies or black studies.  So, there, there are a lot of us that are around and those are some of the people I would see.  And Nick Nelson [William E. Nelson, Jr.] at Ohio State [The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio], who once had one of the best programs in the nation, and one of the largest programs in the nation, so I would count, count them.  And Talmadge Anderson out at the University of, or out at Washington State University [Pullman, Washington], who started the Western Journal of Black Studies; Molefi Asante [HistoryMaker Molefi Kete Asante], who started the Journal of Black Studies, and who was at one of the first people out at the program at UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California].  So, there's, there's just a lot of folk.  And we attempted to include those folk in the volume, 'Out of the Revolution: The Development of Africana Studies.'
Speaker 2: Yeah, the name, 'Out of the Revolution,' you know--I mean, speaks to, I guess, the student origin of the community origin of the discipline.
Speaker 1: Um-hm, of the discipline.  And it, it's the only one in the academy that came out of the struggle and fighting of the community and of students.  All other disciplines have come out because of a consensus of faculty people on the campuses.  And that's also been one of the problems for the field when you get students who move on in terms of maintaining the stability.
Story_ID: 356284
Speaker 1: Now, tell me on the term, Africana studies, I don't know, I always, I thought--correct me if I'm wrong--I think it was coined by John Henrik Clarke (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, it was, yes, by John Henrik Clarke, and so, and, of course, you know, I didn't say him, but he is one of the, the pioneers of the field--John Henrik Clarke.  Yes, he says that every, you know, you don't just come out of the air.  You come from a, from a land base.  And so, that, that reflects and speaks to us, Africana.  And so, that's why much of the field is moving toward that one, that unified name.  During my terms as president of the National Council [National Council of Black Studies], this is something that came up.  I did monumental studies, which were funded by the Ford Foundation [New York, New York], under the auspices of NCBS [National Council of Black Studies].  And what we found is that so many people say, well, what are you?  And, you know, you go to talk to presidents about continuing department programs, say, well, what do you stand for?  You're African American here.  You're Africana here.  You're a Pan (unclear).  You're, you're, you're a Pan here.  So, what are you?  And so, in this survey, I asked people.  And folk were beginning to say that we needed uni-, uni-, uniformity of names.  You can have the discipline of sociology.  And you have mus-, you have medical sociology.  You have race relations.  You have family sociology.  You have political sociology.  You have sociology of education, all kinds of sub-areas.  And the same in psychology, so why can't we have Africana studies, and dependent upon what you focus on, your specialty, then you can break it up and call it, call it that.
Story_ID: 356285
Speaker 1: Now, you went to Ghana in '72 [1972], right?  Was that, was that the university (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah, I went to Ghana in '72 [1972], and I've been going back every--since.  In fact, my husband [Kwame Essuon] and I have formed a foundation, the Kess Nsona Foundation, which is--
Speaker 1: Can you spell that for us, please?
Speaker 2: Kess, K-E-S-S, Nsona, N-S-O-N-A Foundation--and Nsona coming from the people, a grouping of folk there in Ghana.  And I, I, I went there in 2000 with my husband.  And my husband is a Ghanaian, went there in 2000 with him.  And my idea, I was going to start a little kindergarten.  And folk say, "Well, we don't need any kindergarten.  That's a nice idea, but that's your idea."  And then, I went back to my social work training--that you start where the client is, and you get what they want.  They said, "Well, we need, we need clinics, and we need kids to be able to get scholarships to go to college."  And so, we decided that we would take our own monies, and we would, excuse me (cough), we would come up with a way of placing kids in college.  And since then, we have gotten--I think, ten have finished college.  We paid for them and in various fields--journalism, chemistry, business, et cetera.  And we also decided that we would have a health component, and that we would come up with the clinics.  So, we have the land, and we have a building for the clinic.  And now, we're in the process of, of getting it certified, so that we can have doctors and nurses come periodically to the villages.  And then, we built a 15,000 square foot place, community center, so that women can come there, and go through educational workshops about HIV/AIDS [human immunodeficiency virus, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome], about breast-feeding, whatever they needed.  So, yeah, from 1972, (cough) excuse me, from 1972 until now, I've been going back and back, back and forth.
Speaker 1: You--I think you served as a visiting professor--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I served as a (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) a distinguished visiting professor--
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: --in '97 [1997], I guess, was, yeah--
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: --at the University of Ghana?
Speaker 2: University of Ghana in Cape Coast [University of Cape Coast, Cape Coast, Ghana].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 356286
Speaker 1: Now, one of the, one of the focuses--I guess, we have to ask about the--you've written about a lot of things about--the one book ['Focusing: Black Male-Female Relationships,' Delores P. Aldridge] focusing on black male-female relationships is one that's gotten a lot of distribution and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, a lot of it.
Speaker 1: And what is your, what is that basically about?
Speaker 2: Well, there were lots of people saying lots of things about black male-female relationships, and everybody having impressions about them.  And what I wanted to do is give a conceptual understanding of why it is that we have the kinds of relationships we have.  So, you have a framework, you have a theoretical base to analyze relationships.  And so I did.  I looked at paradigms, and I pulled one together on racism, capitalism, Judeo-Christianism [Judeo-Christianity], and sexism.  And if you take these and put them in a paradigm, and you attempt to understand how black males and females fit into each of these categories, then you get some sense of why it is that there will be the nature of their relationships, why it is they'll be in and out of divorce, why it is that they will be violent toward each other.  And then, I took this paradigm, and applied it to specific social situations, violence, et cetera.  And it's, it's interesting now that I am completing another book.  And it will be applicable, not only to African Americans, but to Latinos and whites because what it will, what the paradigm is doing, is saying that these factors impinge on all relationships.  But they impinge differentially, depending upon how you experience sexism, racism.  And so, you would not have as much as the breakdown in white-white relationships because they don't have to contend with the racism that spills over into relationships.  And the same thing with the Latinos, they will begin to have more of the racism part spilling into theirs.  So, the paradigm is one that's going to be applicable to, not only black males and females, but you will be able to use it to look at all relationships, and to be able to look at them in a, in a differential way.  And then, I did the other volume to actually look at empirical work that explained these different aspects of the paradigm, so that you would have the, the first two volumes that I had.
Story_ID: 356287
Speaker 1: Now, I mean, you're a full professor [at Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia] now.  I guess you're approaching retirement, I guess, sort of (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Are, what are the most important things to you now in terms of what your work is?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, when you look at all of this, what it all comes down to is that I'm really concerned about social justice, (unclear) democracy.  And so, you look at male-female relationships, you look at Africana studies, you look at the mental health aspects, you look at the family relationships, all the things that I've written about.  And it all points to social justice.  How do we have social justice for all groups within the society, within the world, and how do we look at theory and research, and put it in some form that we can put it into policy, and make things better for all of us?  So, that, that's, that's where I have been here.  That's what led me, was my whole love affair with equity and social justice back when I was in the Civil Rights Movement.  And I've never veered from that.  It might appear that I go in different spokes, but I've never veered from that.  All of these pieces now come together in one holistic fashion--social justice.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Now, when I retire--and I don't think I'm ever going to retire, I think I'm going to die unless I get physically ill.  But I will change venues.  I will change focus on some of the things I'm doing.  And I don't think I'll ever stop teaching.  I just won't teach in the traditional sense of being in the classroom because anybody I get in my, in, in, in my grasp, I'm going to teach something.  But I think that now, I am far more interested in the international arena.  I'm interested in further developing Kess Nsona [Kess Nsona Foundation], that it can have funds, that it can give to doing these, to this focus on health and education, whether it's in Africa, or if it's in the Caribbean, or if it's here.  So, I'm going, I'm going to do, do that piece.  But I, I think that right now, and at least until 2010, I will continue to work in the greater Atlanta [Georgia] area on a variety of authorities.  I was appointed by the CEO of DeKalb County [Georgia] a year ago to the DeKalb economic development authority [Development Authority of Dekalb County; Decide DeKalb], to the DeKalb Hospital Authority [Fulton-DeKalb Hospital Authority], to the DeKalb senior citizens and elderly authority, and to the joint DeKalb, joint authority of four metro counties.  Now, this is a big chunk to work with because in being involved with this, this means that you have your fingers on the pulse of what this metro area will become, and you're part of the making.  And, of course, you know, as you've heard me talk, I'm always interested in challenge.  And everybody say, well, when do you have time to do that while you're over here trying to write?  Well, so many ideas are sparked by being in the midst of things that are happening.  And then, you go, and you get the data that you can verify and, and the like.
Story_ID: 356288
Speaker 1: And so, I will continue to do that, working on the national level in these many organizations, on the international level, and right here in the DeKalb [DeKalb County, Georgia] metro area that I will probably stay.  We will at least maintain a home here, as well as in other places.  That's a whole another side of me, you know, we--my husband [Kwame Essuon] and I--in 1972, we were married in '74 [1974]--1974, we bought a home in DeKalb County.  It's a ten-acre piece of land in the heart of Decatur [Georgia].  And so now, we have all these houses around and we--it's in the middle of this development.  But we're there, and it was an old farm house that was dilapidated, no windows in it, walls knocked in.  And we went there, only one light bulb hanging down in the halls, and fireplaces all painted over.  And so, we have brought it back to what it was at the turn of the century.  Our affairs, we've gotten some help along the way, but I really feel that part of my skin is on the walls in that house, literally, from using the lye and water to strip the hardwood floors, and to strip all of the fireplaces in the house.  And so, and we have the pecans, and the apple trees, and the plum trees, and the stream, and also, but probably, we probably will maintain that, as well as our home in Africa.  And we travel back and forth, so as long as health, and that's the one thing that I've al-, that's, that's the one thing that I've always asked for, was ask the Lord for was health, sound mind, and opportunity--good health, sound mind, and opportunity.  And as long as that stays with me, I will continue, I will keep on, keeping on.
Story_ID: 356289
Speaker 1: We always ask this question.  What, what are some of your hopes and concerns today for the African American community?
Speaker 2: I, I'm hoping that we can really reflect back on so much of the strength and goodness of the community, and what made us the mighty powerful people that we once were, and then, we still are, and that our youth will be able to buy into some of that.  Of course, moving on with the technology, and the like, but that the youth will be able to dig deep, and see what they come from, the roots they come from, and that we will see a transformation in what we are now seeing on the ground.  I am very, very bothered by so much of what I see in terms of behavior with the younger generation.  And I know that our generation had lots of things, the trouble, the older generation, but it just seems that we're at a turning point now, and that we've got to reorient our youth, that they can take their rightful places as we move on off the scene.  And I'm concerned about how we've got to go about doing that.  But I think it goes back to education, not so much the public school education.  I think that we, we ask too much of public schools.  We ask too much of teachers.  I think there's so much that, that they need to do, but I think we have to do so much of it in the home.  And while we have a number of kids, raising kids, we've got to have some older adults taking responsibility to help shape them.

Speaker 1: When you look back at everything you've done to this point, is there any major thing that you would do differently?
Speaker 2: I think that if I had to do things over, I would just do them harder than I did before.  I think that I didn't give as much as I could have given to all the things that I was involved in.  I think that I would give more than what I've done.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And, likewise, when you look back on everything--I mean, what, today, would you consider, I guess, to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I, I guess I'd like for--well, I hope I don't go anywhere soon, but (laughter), I, I think, probably caring.  I cared about people, and I tried to make things better in this life.

Speaker 1: Tell us about your family.  Do you have children?  I know you're married, you said, but (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, I have two children.  I have a daughter and a son--Aba Delores [Aba Delores Essuon], and Kwame Gyesie, G-Y-E-S-I-E, Essuon [Kwame Gyesie Essuon].  And my husband's name is Kwame Essuon, boy child, born on Saturday, last name spelled E-S-S-U-O-N.  And I, I rarely use that name.  I, I use it, personally, you know, for Christmas cards and invitations at the house and the like.  And, once I was in the hospital, and I was under his name 'cause he's paying the bill.  And my friend, whose husband was this, the medical doctor on char-, in charge, she called--he called her and said, "Well, Marge [ph.], Dee [HistoryMaker Delores P. Aldridge] is not in this hospital.  I don't see her in here."  And so, Margaret told him, "Wait, just look under Essuon, and maybe you'll find her," (laughter).  And he did because I'm, I'm always joking, whenever it comes to spending his money, I can definitely use his name.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, it's E-S-S-U (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) E-S-S-U-O-N.
Speaker 1: --U-O-N, okay--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: All right.

Speaker 1: Is there anything that we have not asked you that you think that must be on record before we ask our final question?
Speaker 2: I guess, probably the saddest time of my life, and one of the happiest times of my life.  The saddest time was when I watched that plane hit into the World Trade Center [New York, New York].  And I, I thought it was a fiction thing when I looked at it.  You know, oh, my God, what a fiction--and then to realize that it was reality.  And it was a week after, before I could, it could even settle on me, that could even dawn on me because I just thought that maybe my sister [Jacquelyn Aldridge-Frederick] was disoriented somewhere, and she would show up again, that she was not instantly cremated, incinerated.  That, that, that was a sad time.  And I guess, one of the happiest moments--and I've had so many happy moments because I've had so many good things to happen to me.  I, you know, I've just been so blessed, and I got so many awards and all kinds of good stuff.  But, you know, I, I think one that this stands out in my mind is when my son [Kwame Gyesie Essuon] crossed the stage getting his high school diploma that, you know, I pride myself on being rather serene and stately.  I just jumped up, and started clapping, and, and other folks were clapping.  I just clapping when he walked across because he's a very bright person, but wasn't very disciplined, no matter how much I tried.  He, you know, he did things his way.  And so, I just thought, it did, like pulling my line as he walked across.  And he didn't take that last exam.  And so, when he walked across, I just about had a fit.  That was a happy day, 'cause I never even thought about who had where my daughter, Aba [Aba Delores Essuon].  I mean, of course, she's going to get through and boom-boom.  And then, when he went on off to college--I mean, so that, those, those are some, some really kinds of fine, defining, defining moments, yeah.

Speaker 1: Well, the last question we have is similar to a legacy, but a little different.  How would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: I think probably however each individual who has come across my path chooses to remember me.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: That's a good answer.  Thank you so much (unclear).
Speaker 2: Thank you, thank you, I've enjoyed it.

Speaker 1: This is a pho-, photograph of Delores Aldridge [HistoryMaker Delores P. Aldridge], myself, and my first B.A. student in black studies, Gloria Bowden, who later became an Episcopalian priest.  This picture was taken on the occasion of my receiving one of the Great Teachers of the Century Awards at Emory University [Atlanta, Georgia] in the late 1980s.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Right, that's perfect, next one.  Okay, and this one.
Speaker 1: This is a photograph in the lieutenant governor of Georgia's office.  In the center, you'll see Governor Pierre Howard.  To his right will be myself, Delores Aldridge.  And to my right would be Senator Charles Walker [Charles W. Walker], who's the highest-ranking black in the Georgia legislature [Georgia General Assembly].  And then, next to him will be Rita Samuels, who's head of the Georgia Coalition of Black Women.  And then, the last person would be our now current mayor of the City of Atlanta [Georgia], Shirley Franklin.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Right, next.  Go ahead.
Speaker 1: This is a picture of me, Delores Aldridge, in my younger days, with Governor Zell Miller, who was at that time, the governor of Georgia.  And I was in the Governor's Mansion [Atlanta, Georgia] for a meeting with him.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Do you have sort of a date? I know you said your younger days?
Speaker 1: That would have--in, in the decade of the '80s [1980s].
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Okay, that's good enough.  Next, please.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: This is a picture of me, Delores Aldridge, at Emory's commencement in 1992.  And I am being given the university's highest award, the Thomas Jefferson Award.  And it's being given to me by Mikhail Gorbachev, who was the former premier of the Soviet Union [Russia].  And also at the occasion was President Jame-, Jimmy Carter [President James Earl "Jimmy" Carter, Jr.], who you can't see him on photograph.
