Nykolaiszyn  S. Peters  Nykolaiszyn  D. Peters  Nykolaiszyn  D. Peters  Today is Friday, October 3, 2014. My name is Juliana Nykolaiszyn. Also  with me is Tanya Finchum. We   re with the Oklahoma Oral History  Research Program at the OSU Library, and today we   re interviewing  Donald and Sue Peters in Maud, Oklahoma. We   re here today to talk  about your family   s centennial farm, the Peters Farms, and we   re so  happy you   re with us today. Thank you so much.  You   re welcome.  Well, let   s begin by learning a little bit more about your family. How did  your family come to this part of Oklahoma?  Well, my granddad came from Germany, and they say he was in  seventeen states before he ever landed here. He was in the Land Run of     89, but he didn   t get any land. There   s no record of it, but I know he  was. I   ve got a little bit of proof right there. Then he evidently was  living in Kansas, and there was some Indians living in that area that had  the allotment of this home place out here. Well, he ended up buying 160  acres off of them, out of the 240 acres that he owned. Then he came  down here, and that was in    95. Then in 1902, he bought another eighty  acres from the same allotment, and that   s the way we ended up with the  property. Some of them thought he got land in the Land Run, but he  didn   t. We researched it and researched it, and he did not get any land.  They thought he got the land and traded it for this place, but he didn   t.  He bought it. Anyway, that   s the way we ended up with the property.  And how many acres did he buy?  Well, the first time he bought, he got 160 acres, and then in    02, he got  another 80 acres to go with that, makes it 240 acres there. That   s what   s  still out there.  5  Nykolaiszyn  D. Peters  S. Peters  D. Peters  S. Peters  D. Peters  S. Peters  D. Peters  Nykolaiszyn  D. Peters  S. Peters  D. Peters  S. Peters  D. Peters  S. Peters  And was he a farmer by trade?  You know, yes and no. He did a little bit of everything. He was one of  these persons that wasn   t afraid to take a chance, and he was into  everything. I   ve got stocks where he bought stock     Oil stock.     and bought land. He owned more land than that 240 acres that we own  in the next section there. He was quite a go-getter, I tell you. He was all  over. I   ve got a picture of him at Raymondville, Texas, of all places,  where he   s down there on one of these land promotion deals, and there  he is, right on the front row. (Laughter) He didn   t buy any land down  there, I   m pretty sure. That   s just the kind of person he was. My wife  was telling me (I   d dang-near forgotten it) he brought books with him  from Germany on livestock and farming and what have you     Educational books.     and he was more or less self-taught as far as coming to the farm.  As far as we know.  Yes, as far as we know.  Was he married when he came to Oklahoma?  No, no he was twenty-eight years old, and we have the name and  everything when he came over. We   re just 99 percent sure that that is  him because it lists him at twenty-eight years old and all the other  information about it. We   re just sure that   s him, but I know he was  twenty-eight years old when he got here.  He married in    97.  Yes, he had the place for two years, then he married a Swanda.  Antonia Swanda. She also came here   she came as a child. She was  eight when she came with her parents.  Her daddy was in the Land Run down around Lexington, and he was  successful in getting land. How they met, I don   t really know. We   re  kind of suspicious they might have known each other back up in Kansas  and Nebraska.  The families may have known each other. She was twenty years younger  6  D. Peters  S. Peters  D. Peters  S. Peters  D. Peters  Finchum  D. Peters  Nykolaiszyn  D. Peters  S. Peters  D. Peters  S. Peters  D. Peters  S. Peters  D. Peters  than him.  That   s about right.  No, ten years. He was twenty-eight when they married. No, he was  thirty-seven. Gosh, he was     No, he was thirty.     thirty-seven, and she was eighteen, yes.  Okay.  That   d be almost twenty.  We are nearly sure that they probably knew each other up in Kansas and  Nebraska, but as far as proof, we don   t have it.  Well, you know, he was self-taught, he read a lot of books about  farming. What was happening on the farm? Any idea of what he was  growing, or the livestock?  Yep, we   ve got pictures there that he had cattle. Looks like they was  Holstein mixed. He had hogs. He had bees. What else? Chickens.  Chickens.  They had about everything they needed to live there, except flour and  stuff like that.  They sold their extra eggs or butter or milk or hams. He smoked all his  own meat, and they sold what they didn   t need to eat.  I found a, in the old bank up here   they built a new bank, and the people  that owned it gave the historical society the old bank. Well, it   s got an  upstairs in it, and we was up there, I don   t know, several months after  we obtained it. We was in one of the rooms upstairs and walked over  there and picked up a little ledger. Guess whose name was on the front  page? My grandpa. He had brought the first     Sold cotton.     cotton into Maud. I thought,    How lucky could I be?    (Laughter)  Anyway, they raised cotton, and I know they raised peanuts and hay,  hegari.  7  S. Peters  D. Peters  Nykolaiszyn  S. Peters  D. Peters  S. Peters  D. Peters  S. Peters  D. Peters  Finchum  D. Peters  S. Peters  D. Peters  S. Peters  D. Peters  Nykolaiszyn  D. Peters  Hegari.  I was trying to think of something. Mostly hay, you know.  What   s hegari?  It   s a feed.  Head, it   s got the little     Maize.  Maize.  Do you know what maize is? Same thing, same type of thing, feed it to  your chickens or     Anyway, I don   t know. No telling what else he raised.  Where would they take their produce and things to market?  The cotton came into Maud.  I was going to tell you   . There   s pictures there he brought with him,  right here, of his family and him as a child.  You asked about where they took their produce and everything. I didn   t  know it until I read that little ledger, but they brought the cotton into  Maud. Of course, he could take it to Tecumseh or Earlsboro, (they had a  rail line in through there) but I would think it was either Maud or  Tecumseh.  Oh, they had at least two cotton gins here at that time. We used to be a  pretty good sized town.  I think, probably, like on the hogs and stuff, he kind of bartered that stuff  with everyone. Like I say, he knew that would make a dollar.  Well, tell me about the structures on the farm when he was coming up.  Okay, let   s just start with the henhouse. It was right out to the south and  a little bit east of the house, just a short distance where they kept the  chickens. Right on around was what we always referred to as the old  granary. It sat up   you had to step up pretty high to get in it, but that   s  where it was. Then behind it, there was a shop, blacksmith   s shop. They  had the old coal forge. I can remember going back there and watching  8  S. Peters  D. Peters  S. Peters  D. Peters  S. Peters  D. Peters  S. Peters  D. Peters  S. Peters  Nykolaiszyn  S. Peters  D. Peters  Nykolaiszyn  S. Peters  Daddy heat up metal and what have you. Then on north of that was the  main barn. It was a pretty good sized barn because it had a loft in it and  a shed on the west side of it. Right on the north of that, that was where  the hog pen was and the building for them, and then west of that was a  big cow lot. I remember Daddy going out there, milking all the time.  Then finally fixed part of the barn where we put stanchions in there to  put the cows in there and milk in there. One other little building out  there, and I don   t really know what its first purpose was, but later years,  Daddy ground feed, and that   s where blew it into from the grinder. I can  remember that well because there wasn   t nothing but dust out there  whenever he was grinding. I guess that   s     A little shop south of the house        the cellar.  The little shop where the Delco system was, later years.  Oh, that was the garage, okay.  Yes, the cellar.  There was a garage out there. Whenever I was kid, all we had was  kerosene lamps, and one of the biggest improvements was when they put  a Delco system out there. You at least had lights, you know. Made all  the difference in the world. Then the cellar was built right, as far as from  here to that wall from the back door, southeast door, and you could step  out, take two steps, and be in the cellar.  It   s big as our kitchen or bigger.  It   s still a good cellar right now. It just needs a little work done on the  door. That   s all the buildings that I can think of.  The house. No, the log cabin.  I was going to ask where he lived at first.  They lived in a log cabin.  Yeah, but I don   t know exactly where it was from the main house now.  Well, we   ve got pictures here someplace that     Did he build the cabin?  Oh, I   m sure he did. He built everything else. (Laughs)  9  Nykolaiszyn  D. Peters  S. Peters  D. Peters  S. Peters  D. Peters  Nykolaiszyn  D. Peters  Nykolaiszyn  D. Peters  S. Peters  D. Peters  S. Peters  And eventually they moved into a house?  Whenever he first got that land, it was just raw land. That   s all it was.  Nothing on it. The story is, there was a little ditch runs down east of it,  then it curves back to the west. They said he lived along that ditch and  the rocks until he got a place built for him to stay in. I   d always thought  it was on the east, but you get to looking at it, and you don   t believe that.  When it turns back west, there   s rocks there that   d be ideal for camping,  so I   m pretty sure that   s where he stayed is just a little ways from the  house, up the hill there.  He stayed along the creek so he   d have water because there wasn   t a  well there yet, which they dug their well, too. It was out by the house.  Well, they probably had that drilled. I don   t...  Think they did?  Well, it   s a small hole they had.  Well, tell me about the house that was eventually built.  Okay, the main house as it is today was built in three different sections.  The first section was two bedrooms. I don   t know how long they lived in  it, and then they built the two rooms on the east of it. Then a little later  they built an upstairs and a big room down over the big room there  which we call the living room now. So it was built in three different  parts. The last part we think was built in 1920,    22, because (I may be  telling too much here) it   s got a wraparound cement porch on it. It was  nice in those days, I guarantee. And in the corner, they had a print of a  big leaf and the stem, and on it they had a date of 1922, so that was  when that porch was run. If you count back, it probably took them six  months or maybe a year to build that front two rooms and the upstairs.  That   s when they finally finished it.  How was it heated?  Well, wood to start off with, I   m sure. In fact, that   s what we burnt  whenever I was a little kid.  Your mother, too.  Yes.  She liked the wood stove.  1 0  D. Peters  Nykolaiszyn  D. Peters  S. Peters  D. Peters  S. Peters  Nykolaiszyn  D. Peters  Nykolaiszyn  D. Peters  I remember we had the wood piles out just east of the house there. Then  in later years, around    40, they started drilling, and Daddy laid a gas line  over there where he could get gas, and we had gas. Only thing about that  is that, it   s kind of smoky in rooms after you run it. Anyway, that went  on until they made us get off of it, and then we went to propane, or  actually, butane. That   s where they put the tank in the ground (I can  remember that just as well) to keep it kind of heated up and enough  pressure to get it out of there. Everybody burns propane now, so it   s just  got so much more pressure. Anyway that   s what we burn out there now  for heat and cooking.  How many children did your grandfather have?  Had nine, wasn   t it?  No, seven.  Really?  Willie , Anton, John, Daddy  Carl , Jasper, Annie, Harry.  Seven. Six boys and one girl.  And did they all help out on the farm?  I   m sure they did.  Well, tell me a little bit about your father.  Well, he was the middle of the   he was the fourth boy, and he ended up  with the place after Grandpa passed away. My grandpa and grandma  decided they wanted to go to Sulphur  Oklahoma  and take the mineral  baths. This was in about 1927 because I   ve got deeds of where they  bought a house down to Sulphur. My uncle John, which was the third  child, and his wife moved in because they was living in a little ol    two-or  three-room house which they called a weaning house down below the  hill. So they moved up there in that house. Well, in    36 or    37, they  moved out to their own house over back west, and Mother and Daddy  moved into the house. That   s where we lived. I was born a mile from  there, just half north and half west in what was   I didn   t know it until  just recently, but the house we lived in, my uncle John and them,  Grandpa moved it for them to their place. Then we moved into home  place.  Anyway, that went on for I don   t know exactly what year, but it had to  be in the late   30s. Daddy knew that Grandpa and Grandma were getting  homesick for the home. My mother told me, said every time we   d go  1 1  S. Peters  D. Peters  S. Peters  D. Peters  S. Peters  D. Peters  Nykolaiszyn  D. Peters  Nykolaiszyn  D. Peters  S. Peters  D. Peters  down there, Grandpa would tell Daddy,    Don   t forget to bring my hegari  for my chickens.    So Daddy   d bag up a bunch of that feed and take  down. Anyway, Daddy asked one time, he said,    Dad, you   re homesick.  Would you like to move back up there?    Of course, that was all it took.     Yeah.    They moved in with us. They took the two south rooms of the  house, and we kept the rest of it, anyway, right along there until Grandpa  died in    41. I guess that   s about it. Anyway, I   ve done lost   which  question did you ask me? (Laughter)  Tell them about your dogs.  I guess I finished up. Daddy, he took up the farming and did mostly hay,  and I can remember him raising peanuts.  And cattle.  Cattle. When they did the hay, all the people come in, not all of them     Neighbors.     any of the neighbors that had hay, themselves, and they kind of shared  one old horse-drawn baler, where they went around and around. I   ve still  got it out there at the house. Then later years, he got to roustabouting on  a lease and was drilling oil back over there. He raised cattle and hay on  the farm and that was about the extent of his farming.  So he also worked off the farm a little bit?  Yes. I can see where they could make a living early on, but later on I  don   t see how they could in the later years.  Well, going back to your father for a second, did he ever share with you  memories of growing up on the land and what some of his work would  entail as a young man or     Well     He helped haul the rocks for the front porch. Said they moved rocks  forever from the creek, to fill the   you   ll have to see the porch to see  why.  Yeah, it got to where it was cracked so bad that when Sue and I   my  sister didn   t want the place, so I bought her part. That cement porch was  cracked so bad, and it was lipping up where you could trip over it and  whatever. We decided we   d build a new porch, so when he started  digging that stuff out, I bet there was no telling how many wheelbarrows  1 2  Nykolaiszyn  D. Peters  S. Peters  D. Peters  Nykolaiszyn  D. Peters  S. Peters  Nykolaiszyn  S. Peters  Nykolaiszyn  D. Peters  Nykolaiszyn  and wagon loads of little rocks about this big. They must have picked  them up in a mile radius of that house, but anyway, I hauled a bunch of  them. I had too many of them to run cement back. No, as far as him  telling me any stories, I can   t think of any right now.  Where did he go to school?  He went to what they called Old Remus. Later years, they moved that  school south, and that   s where I went to grade school, New Remus.  Your mama went to Harjo.  My mother went to Harjo. I don   t know   I don   t think Daddy went any  further than that grade school. I know my uncle did because he was one  of the first graduates out of Maud High School.  What did your grandmother do for a living, or would she just help take  care of the family?  She was a homemaker and, you know.  Helped take care of her daddy. Her mother had died.  Okay.  Kind of looked after   of course, they were at Noble, but still. If they  needed help, she went to help, if you can imagine having seven kids and  go help. (Laughs)  Well, how did your father meet your mother?  Well, I suppose probably at the church. Back then, we went to church  either to Remus School or Pleasant Valley. I can remember going to  both of them. Then in later years, Daddy and several of the men built the  Rock Church out there, is what it   s known as, the Rock Church, because  that   s exactly what it is. I remember Daddy telling, said that   s back then  when tires where hard to get. They would haul these rocks from one of  the men   s place, which was probably about two or three miles from that  church, and they   d put them in old pickups or in the turtleback of a car,  just any way to get them back over there. He said,    We were forever  patching tires, blowing those tires out,    and they   d have to stop and  patch those tires before they could go on. Anyway, it was quite a  struggle to get that church built, but that   s when we all started going to  the Rock Church.  Well, he had seven brothers and a sister, seven siblings.  1 3  S. Peters  Nykolaiszyn  D. Peters  S. Peters  D. Peters  Nykolaiszyn  D. Peters  Nykolaiszyn  D. Peters  S. Peters  D. Peters  Five brothers. Five brothers and a sister.  So there were six siblings. How did the farm come into his possession?  Okay, the oldest boy, which was Willie, born in    98, died when he was  twenty-eight years old, I think it was, twenty-eight or thirty. He was  plowing or something, working in a field. It came a rain, and he got  pneumonia, and he died. Then the second son was my uncle Anton, and  I think he already had a house over on some of the other land. Uncle  John was the one that moved into the house when they went to Sulphur.  Then, of course, we were living over there. It wasn   t too far from it. The  other kids really didn   t care anything about the land.  Well, they were in Sulphur.  Yeah, they   d moved to Sulphur, and they went to school in Sulphur  down there. When it was all divided up   well, let me back up. Mother  told me that Grandpa asked Daddy   I think that   s when they moved  back up there with him. He asked Daddy, he said,    Would you like to  have this farm, this one here?    Daddy said,    Sure I would.    I guess he  already had it set up because Daddy took that place, and Uncle Anton  took some land there, and Uncle John, so that was their first three of the  sons right there. The oldest one had already died. The other kids didn   t  want land, (they wanted money for stuff) so they switched it around, and  that   s the way they did it, and Daddy ended up with the place.  Well, when you moved to the farmhouse, let   s talk about your life  growing up. Where was your room?  About every one of them. Oh, I can remember sleeping upstairs. I  remember sleeping on the porch, and I remember sleeping in what was  one of the south rooms there because whenever it would storm, you got  up and you went to the cellar. You know, I hated to roll out of that bed  and go to the cellar. (Laughter) Anyway, that   s where I was sleeping that  I really remember going to the cellar, but, yes, I slept all over.  How would you keep warm?  Well, pile on enough quilts. That   s the main thing. That upstairs wasn   t  heated. Just whatever heat you got was     Came upstairs.     heat that drifted up the stairwell.  1 4  Nykolaiszyn  S. Peters  D. Peters  S. Peters  Nykolaiszyn  S. Peters  D. Peters  S. Peters  D. Peters  S. Peters  D. Peters  S. Peters  D. Peters  S. Peters  D. Peters  Nykolaiszyn  D. Peters  Nykolaiszyn  D. Peters  Nykolaiszyn  D. Peters  What was bath time like? Bath time? Taking a bath.  The old washtub.  Oh, that was what took   you had to draw the water, and they would heat  it outside in a wood fire, carry it in there, and dump it in the tub when  you got it the right temperature, and you jump in.  That   s why REA  Rural Electric Association  was nice when it came  through.  What year did it come through? What year did you get electricity?  REA? In the    40s, early    40s.  Well, we was still burning, had the Delco system when Grandpa died.  Well, that was    41.  It had to be the late    40s.  What about when your Grandma moved over into her house?  Well     Did you have electricity then?     I don   t remember that. I don   t really know.  It was around the mid-  40s, somewhere along there.  Yeah, a little later maybe.  Did you have brothers and sisters?  One sister.  Okay. So let   s talk about some of your chores growing up.  My chores?  Yes.  Well, of course, when I was real little I entertained myself. Then the  neighbors moved in, and they had a little boy a little bit younger than  myself, and we became pretty good pals. We would either, he was at our  1 5  Nykolaiszyn  D. Peters  Nykolaiszyn  D. Peters  S. Peters  D. Peters  house, or I was over there. They just lived across the road from us. Then  my chores after I got on older was, I know one I really remember is we  would milk. Daddy was milking some cows, and that was after we  moved the milking parlor, you could call it, I guess, to the main barn.  Daddy got in there and built some stanchions to hold them steady and  everything.  That   s about the time he went to helping roustabout over there. He had  told me one day, he said,    If you   ll help me milk those cows and take  care of them, you can have the cream to sell.    I said,    Okay.    So that   s  what I did. I milked, and it   d take me forever. Daddy   d just sit down and  keep going, and I   d give out about three or four jerks. I   d milk those  cows and take the milk and put it in separators and turn it and crank it  out. Then I   d save the cream and turn the milk over to Mother. That was  one of my main jobs, and, I imagine, carrying in wood being another  one. Then after I got older, by then, Daddy had that ol    Allis-Chalmers  tractor, and I got to where I could work it, like mowing or plowing or  something like that.  You remember the first time you got to drive the tractor?  Not really because it just kind of, you know, something natural for me.  What year were you born?  Thirty-four. I was about two years old when we moved into that place  over there.  You helped with the hay, too.  Yeah, helped bale. (Laughter) We had the old horse-drawn baler where  the horse walked around in circles. Well, that was my job whenever I  was smaller, sitting on the bale of hay, keeping that horse going,  chunking rocks at him with the, I guess everybody called it    beanie  flip,    see, if the ol    horse got too slow. Well, I got to where I was  thinking that I ought to be able to step up one to the rake, you know,  dumper. Of course, they already had somebody running that, so I guess I  was kind of puffed up and pouting about it.  One day they   d set up, up on the meadow. Daddy, I guess, saw that I  wasn   t too interested in my work. He walked over and got me by the  hand, and they   d just got through drilling the well about, oh, as far as  from here to the cattle yard over there. We walked over there and got  down behind that bank of that slush pit, and I got a pretty good  spanking. I was tickled to death to keep that horse going from then on.  (Laughter) I don   t think I ever did get to move up until I got old enough  1 6  Nykolaiszyn  D. Peters  Nykolaiszyn  D. Peters  Nykolaiszyn  D. Peters  to work for my uncle, and then I got to rake all I wanted to there.  Did you have any pets growing up?  Pets? Yes. I had the two I was most fond of and which I remember was  two big Collie dogs. Daddy was mowing oats, I think it was, up on the  prairie, and those dogs   let   s see. Might not have had both of them at  the time. This one went up there with him, and Daddy didn   t see him in  the hay, and he cut his paw off, one of his paws off. Daddy doctored  him, and he got to where it didn   t slow him down. He   d go just as fast as  that other dog. Anyway, we ended up with another dog that my grandpa  had a litter of, and he gave Daddy one of them. Well, I   d take those dogs  and put a rope around their neck, and tie it where it would tighten up and  choke them, and I   d work them. I   d hook them to my little wagon and  fill it with dirt or whatever. Well, that was after Grandpa and them, I  guess, came and moved back up there. He was out there one day, and I  was working, pulling them, leading them, and they was pulling. Grandpa  walked up, and he said,    Son, that   s hurting those dogs. Let me make  you some harnesses.    So he went down there in the shop, and I don   t  know how long it took him. I just remember he made me a little set of  harnesses for the dogs. I   ve got a picture someplace, but anyway, those  two dogs are the ones that I remembered the most.  What were their names?  Tip and Jack. Had another little dog before that. I think we called him  Bulgur for some reason or another. I don   t know where we even got that  name, but he was little ol    black dog about so high. My uncle had sheep,  and I think he got to going over there visiting and aggravating those  sheep, and it cost him dearly. He never did show up after that.  (Laughter) Anyway, we ended up getting the Collie dogs then.  Growing up, how would you get to school?  Walk. Walk, walk, walk, and it was close to two miles one way, but  we   d cut through the pasture. Anyway we could cut off a few steps,  we   d do it. I remember that we had a old bridge that we had to cross, and  it came a pretty good rain, I guess, washed that bridge out. Daddy went  over there and put up pipes, and then had two by fours or two by twelves  or something bolted to those pipes where they wouldn   t wash out.  Daddy told us,    If y   all ever go over there and it   s looking like the  water   s going to come up, don   t you cross that crossing. You just come  back home.    Been many a time, I say many, several times it   d sprinkle  on us, and we   d turn around and go back. (Laughter) That   s all it took.  He shouldn   t have told us that, (Laughs) but I can remember that.  1 7  Nykolaiszyn  D. Peters  Nykolaiszyn  D. Peters  S. Peters  D. Peters  Nykolaiszyn  S. Peters  We lived here, and across the road there, across the pond that was there,  our neighbors lived, and they would come across that pond. We   d watch  for them, and we   d walk out and meet them. We   d go on over to what  was the old Amerada camp and meet up with two or three other kids  over there. Then we   d walk on to school. Sometimes we   d meet some  other kids on the way, but it kind of helped break up the monotony, I  guess, of it. One funny story I still think about, one day we started home  from school, one of the kids, Toby, said,    Your sister and Jim are going  to fight these other two girls, have a fight down there in just a little bit.     Golly, I started worrying about that. I thought,    My sister couldn   t  whoop nothing, let alone that ol    gal.    I worried about that and worried  about that, and got down there to a T in the road. Well, this friend of my  sister, she was the first one to fight one of the other girls. I tell you what,  she was like a buzz saw. She whipped that old gal before she even knew  what happened. That ended the whole fight, and I was so relieved  Wanda didn   t have to fight. Thank goodness she didn   t because I knew  she was going to get the fire beat out of her. (Laughter) There was  always somebody getting in fights, seemed like. There was quite a few  of us walking.  Would you take your lunch?  Yes.  What would you take for lunch?  Well, I tell you what, it was always potted meat or Vienna sausage, it  seemed to me like, and maybe an apple or something. A friend of mine,  (I still think about him), every day he brought fried bologna sandwiches,  every day, just like me with potted meat or Vienna sausages. I knew  what I was going to have. One day we went out there and was sitting out  on the teeter-totters, I think, going to eat lunch. I said, one of us, I don   t  know whether he said it first,    You want to trade sandwiches?    Man, we  jumped at the deal. (Laughter) That was quite a relief to get   that   s  about all we ever     Said he always took his scrap bread home to his dog.  Yeah, that   s why those dogs would meet us half a mile over there before  we got home because they knew they was going to get a little treat.  Anyway, it was quite a lot of memories there.  Did your mom work off the farm?  No, she stayed home. She was part of a home demonstration club. She  used to quilt a lot. I can remember them coming, hanging those frames  1 8  S. Peters  D. Peters  Nykolaiszyn  D. Peters  S. Peters  D. Peters  S. Peters  D. Peters  S. Peters  D. Peters  Nykolaiszyn  D. Peters  S. Peters  from the ceiling, all of them sitting around quilting. She raised a garden,  always had a garden, always canned, and we always had     Helped your daddy put up honey. They raised honey, had honey bees.  We had that cellar there, and it always had all kinds of canned stuff  down there in the cellar. No, she stayed on the farm, worked there all the  time.  What were holidays like?  Well, we always   my mother   s sister, I think they had ten     Ten kids.     kids. One of them is my age, and then there   s all different ages, but  that was always a big treat for them to come see us. We   d go down in  that old barn that had the loft, and we   d have the biggest time.  Ride the horses.  Yeah, ride horses. That pond down there, we was always swimming  down there if it was in the summertime. One of the stories of that  swimming deal, my aunt, the last boy she had, he was just a little old  feller, and we   d been swimming. They had left; Mother and Daddy,  Aunt Ethel and Uncle Earl had went somewhere for a while and left one  of the older girls in charge. Well, we went swimming, we got through,  we come back, and we   s upstairs, the boys were. We was changing  clothes, and they come driving up the road, back. This little one had got  out, crawled out the window, stark naked. Where that roof comes up like  that, he was standing straddle of that. They drove up that road and saw  him up there, and they liked to have died. (Laughter) He wasn   t very  old.  About three. He was about three. (Laughter)  They was always doing something for entertainment.  What about Christmastime?  That was always a time we really looked forward to, but Christmas back  then was a whole lot different than it is now. I got one toy. My sister got  one toy. It   s not like that now. My grandkids, they got enough toys to     Open a toy store.  1 9  D. Peters  Nykolaiszyn  D. Peters  Nykolaiszyn  D. Peters  S. Peters  D. Peters  S. Peters  D. Peters  Nykolaiszyn  D. Peters     pretty near start a store if they had a mind to. It   s a whole lot different,  but I had just as much fun with that one toy as they did with all theirs  now because it was the only thing I had, and I played with it. The other  thing whenever I got a little bit, I don   t know how old, (I was still  playing with toys) I built my own little tractor out of a four by four, put  wheels on it, and fixed a little buck rake. We   d mow that grass out there,  and I   d put it into rows. Take that little buck rake, and I   d pick it up.  Anyway, that entertained me a bunch right there.  Would you go to town much?  Well, back then we   d go Saturday nights, Saturday evenings.  And what would you do?  Well, we   d go to the show. Mom and Daddy would meet the neighbors,  and they   d visit, go to the drugstore, and have some ice cream or  something or other. Back there then, you couldn   t find a parking place at  Maud on Saturday night unless you got there early. Every street up and  down, every parking place would be taken. It was something else.  Well, it was even that way whenever we married, well, even when we  moved back here in    73. It wasn   t unusual to have to circle the block. If  you wanted on Main Street, you   d circle the block two or three times  before you were lucky enough maybe to get a parking space.  Other than going to town, that   s about the only time.  Go to Shawnee once in a while.  Mother used to take me, and I   d go with her and my sister, which I really  didn   t care about. I   d rather stayed at home, but I had to go. That   s while  I was pretty young, but I remember it. The counter is up there, you  know, the  counter  that was way up there. I was scared to death Mother  was going to run off and leave me, so I held onto her dress. She   d  always slap and release, knocking me loose, and I   d turn around and  grab it again. I told her in later years, I told her,    You wanted to try to  run off and leave me. I know good and well. That   s the reason I done  that.    (Laughter) It   d get her, but it aggravated her, I know good and  well, having somebody hang on her dress tail. (Laughs)  Well, after high school what did you end up doing? Did you start  working on the farm?  Well, doing what needed to be done out there, but Daddy was still   I   d  help him some. When I got out of high school, (I shouldn   t tell you this)  2 0  S. Peters  D. Peters  Nykolaiszyn  D. Peters  S. Peters  D. Peters  S. Peters  D. Peters  Nykolaiszyn  D. Peters  Nykolaiszyn  D. Peters  S. Peters  D. Peters  I went to OSU for a semester. Sue wrote it down as a year, but it was  one semester. Me and the boy I ran around with both decided we   d go  down there, and after that one semester we both decided we was coming  back to Maud. He went to OBU  Oklahoma Baptist University , and I  went to work.  And you kept working.  Yeah, kept working and working.  Did you work on the farm, or did you have another job?  Well, I worked at a grocery store. My brother-in-law   s daddy had  O   Daniel Grocery there, and Curtis wanted me to come to work up  there, which I did. I stayed with them for     About two years after we were married.  Our first boy was about six months     Eight months old, Mike was, when we moved.     eight months old when I went to work out at Silver, Texas, at a gas  plant. Her daddy was superintendent, and he told me if I   d come out  there, he   d give me a job. Well, I couldn   t hardly stand leaving here, but  for the money I had to do something. Anyway, that   s what I did. We  ended up coming back and living right across the road. That was after  we bought this place. Then we built this house and moved in here.  We   ve been here ever since.  Well, tell me how you two met.  Well, she started chasing me, and I let her catch me. (Laughter)  Good answer.  No, when I was working in this grocery store, I met every girl that come  to town. If they come in   with somebody I knew about it, most  generally. Her grandmother, or step-grandmother, she was one of these  persons that she had ideas about everything. She done had it made up  that she was going to see that me and Sue got together, and we did, and I  hadn   t been disappointed at all.  That   s     Have you? (Laughter)  2 1  S. Peters  Nykolaiszyn  D. Peters  S. Peters  Nykolaiszyn  S. Peters  Nykolaiszyn  D. Peters  S. Peters  Nykolaiszyn  S. Peters  D. Peters  S. Peters  D. Peters     that   s good. No. That   s good, though. (Laughter) We tell the kids, our  kids and our grandkids, every year when we got the rodeo, that was  supposed to be our first date. Don called and wanted to know were going  to go. They were going to do roping that night, and at that time he was  calf roping. He wanted to know could we come in, my aunt and her  friends and I, come in and meet him at the rodeo arena. We went, and of  all times, he had to work late, so they got bored, and we had to leave.  We crossed paths, and that didn   t stop, though. He called, and the rest is  history.  How long have you been married?  Sixty years in about three months?  Two months, no three. Yes, December 12, sixty years, yes.  And he hasn   t been disappointed.  No.  That   s good.  I tell the story. They asked,    How   d y   all meet?    I usually tell them,     Well, she got me out of the cradle.    (Laughter)  He tells me that a lot. Got him out of the cradle and threw him out in the  cruel world.  Well, at what point, when did you buy the farm from your father?  Oh, after his mother passed away.  Mother stayed out there. Daddy died in    86, and then she died in 2002.  She stayed out there by herself all that time.  I told her,    Do what you want to do. Whatever you want to do, I   ll help  you in whatever I can.    She said,    I want to stay right here where I   m  at,    and I said,    Okay, that   s good enough.    I was working down north  of Whitesboro  Texas  at a gas plant down there, and I came home. I   d  leave here on Monday morning at about two o   clock in the morning,  drive down there. I had a mobile home there on Lake Texoma. I   d stay  Monday night, and then Tuesday evening I   d drive home, and go back  Wednesday morning. Anyway, I was back and forth.  2 2  S. Peters  D. Peters  S. Peters  D. Peters  Nykolaiszyn  D. Peters  Nykolaiszyn  S. Peters  D. Peters  Nykolaiszyn  S. Peters  Nykolaiszyn  D. Peters  What I did, I worked that in with taking care of her cows. I   d come by  there every evening coming home, and I   d feed the cows for that day  and then put out hay for another day in a lot or something. Then all  Mother had to do was go down and open the gate and let the cows eat.  That   s the way I worked all of that. Anyway, she stayed there until she  died in    82.  In 2002.  In 2002, yes.  And we bought his sister   s half.  She didn   t want it, and I couldn   t stand for anybody else having it. If she  wanted to keep her half and run it together, that was fine with me, but I  did not want anybody else owning that place. That   s just how I felt about  it. She agreed to sell. They knew I   d helped Mother a lot, so we bought  it.  Well, when you bought it, what did you plan to do with it at that point?  Well, we already had this place, and I knew I could run some cattle out  there and help pay for it. I just wanted the place, and first thing we did  was start fixing up the house. It had deteriorated. It had wood siding on  it, cracked. We went through there and put new siding on it and did  some changes for the better, I think. We   ll show you that when we get  out there.  What else did you do on the property? You made improvements to the  house.  Barn.  Yeah, I burnt the barn down.... (Laughter)  Did you really?  Yes, he really did. Accidentally, but he did.  Okay.  Backed my pickup in there to pick up a round bale, and it was spitting. I  guess I got that exhaust pipe close to this one bale, and I was having  trouble picking that bale up. It kept falling off. I finally looked, and I  thought,    Well, something ain   t right.    I pulled up, and that bale was  smoking, beginning to burn. I got excited and tried to get that bale that  2 3  S. Peters  D. Peters  S. Peters  D. Peters  S. Peters  D. Peters  S. Peters  D. Peters  S. Peters  D. Peters  S. Peters  D. Peters  S. Peters  was burning, get it out of there, and I couldn   t do that. I guess when I  pulled forward, going to back up to get that one that was burning, I  forgot and left my door open on my pickup. (Laughter) Liked to tore it  off backing up in there. You get excited when something like that  happens. I hollered at Mother     She called the family and the fire department.     told her to call the fire department and started putting together water  hose. Got water out there in that well, but not near enough of it. Daddy  built the barn out of these creosote poles, six by six, I think is what they  were, that come out of these wall heights for support. Those things, just  like burning gasoline. I   d put them out, look around and try to get  something else out, come back, and they   s burning again. I couldn   t stop  it. Finally, I run out of water and run out of breath and everything else,  and so I just had to back off and let it go.  Everybody got there, but it was already gone pretty much by the time we  got out there.  But we got a new barn out of it.  Got the barn that   s currently there.  Anyway, we   ve just been doing improvements.  A new herd of cattle.  Yeah.  Right after we got     One of our sons, he and his wife split up, and they was getting a divorce.  She wanted to stay in their house until she bought her a house, and  anyway, Tony wanted to move out there. He moved out there, and he  does dozer work and builds on a lot of locations around here. He got  started doing a lot of dozer work out there, not charging me anything  because I didn   t charge anything for rent. We cleaned out three ponds, I  think it was, back there when it was     So dry.     so dry.  The pond had shrunk to this.  2 4  D. Peters  Nykolaiszyn  D. Peters  S. Peters  D. Peters  S. Peters  D. Peters  S. Peters  D. Peters  S. Peters  D. Peters  S. Peters  D. Peters  S. Peters  D. Peters  S. Peters  D. Peters  Nykolaiszyn  D. Peters  S. Peters  Improved them a whole bunch and tried to build new fence all the way  around it, too, just general improvements in it.  Well, through the years did your family take on any conservation efforts  on the land?  Well, you know what? Early on, my Grandpa knew about conservation  because his father-in-law came up there with terraces and everything,  and laid all the terraces up on that upper part, and those terraces are still  there.  That would have been back, what, in the   30s?  Probably so.  I bet it was because we have pictures of where he was up there.  It had to be in the   20s.  Twenties?  Teens     Okay.     because I   ve got a picture here someplace, where     Well, I guess so because the kids were little.     he   s in a buggy, him and another, I guess one of his boys.  His son.  They lived down at     Noble.  Noble   down in there.  Well, what   s the water source on the land?  Well, there was a water well, but like I say, I think it caved in years ago,  the very bottom of it. It still had enough we could draw water out of it  and even had enough to run the house. Mother, she was a pro at     Conserving     2 5  D. Peters  S. Peters  D. Peters  S. Peters  D. Peters  S. Peters  D. Peters  S. Peters  Nykolaiszyn  S. Peters  Nykolaiszyn  D. Peters  S. Peters  D. Peters  Nykolaiszyn  S. Peters     saving water.     being conservative.  That   s what we had whenever I remember. I know that they drilled a  well right down in front of the house because they had built a cement  trough. It   s still out there, and that well was right down on a low spot,  and I guess they   d draw that water up and put it in buckets. It wasn   t     Watered the cows.     it wasn   t just a few feet over there to it, or I don   t know whether they  had some pipe to carry the water over there. Anyway, that, and then  when Grandma came back from Sulphur, I think that   s when he built  that big pond, had it built. Now we   ve got all kinds of water for the  cattle, but there   s also a Pottawatomie County Water District. I had  Mother sign up for it whenever they came around wanting people to sign  up because I knew it would be a good deal to go ahead and get on the list  instead of waiting because it cost quite a bit. If they lay that line past you  and you don   t join up, if they had to come back, you had to pay for it.  Plus it gave her a lot better water system, an abundant supply, put it that  way.  I don   t know. It probably don   t taste as good as the well water, but  there   s a bunch of it.  We   re spoiled to well water.  Now is your farm in both counties or just one?  Yes, we   re in two counties.  Has that been challenging through the years, being in two different  counties?  This is in Seminole county. That road right out there is the county line.  Across the road is     Six miles out there is where the place is.  Okay.  We just pay taxes in two counties, basically.  2 6  Finchum  S. Peters  Nykolaiszyn  D. Peters  S. Peters  D. Peters  S. Peters  Nykolaiszyn  S. Peters  D. Peters  S. Peters  D. Peters  S. Peters  D. Peters  S. Peters  D. Peters  S. Peters  Nykolaiszyn  D. Peters  Well, if you went to the county fair, which county fair did you pick?  Probably Pot County because that was where Don   s mother would have  taken her   when she was Home Demonstration, it was in Pot county,  and that   s where they took their canned goods and sewing and yeah.  Actually, I think I won one ribbon in sewing up there, right after we  married.  Do you remember the name of the local club?  Remus.  Remus, yeah, Remus Home Demonstration Club.  Used to be several women belonged to it.  Right, yeah, there was probably twelve, fifteen that belonged to it. A lot  of them are still here, well, some of them. I shouldn   t say a lot of them,  but the ancestry on the younger generations are still here.  Would your dad have any interaction with the county agent?  He was on civil defense     Yeah, he was.     because we   ve got his certificate.  Trying to think. I   m pretty sure he did, but I was trying to think of  something. About the only thing was the     Anton was probably more in     Yeah, Anton     Yeah.     he was big in that.  And his wife was a teacher. They taught the rest.  You mentioned your grandfather   s ledger. How has record keeping  changed through the years?  Well, I still do it about like he does. (Laughter)  2 7  S. Peters  D. Peters  S. Peters  Nykolaiszyn  S. Peters  D. Peters  Nykolaiszyn  D. Peters  S. Peters  D. Peters  S. Peters  D. Peters  Nykolaiszyn  S. Peters  D. Peters  Nykolaiszyn  Pencil and paper.  I keep all my tickets. I mean, I used to not be that particular, but I got to  thinking,    Why not make a little effort and keep everything, and then  when I go have my income tax figured, I don   t have to worry about  something that I didn   t have a ticket on but still took it off.    It   s just a  peace of mind to know that you   ve got tickets to back everything up.  We don   t keep them online, but we do use online for looking up  information and supplies or medicines for the cattle, such as that.  Well, I was going to ask you how you keep up with the latest in farm  news and     Catalogues, too.  I   ve always taken farm magazines.  How do you learn about government programs?  Well, usually one of the last ones to find out. (Laughter) They came out  with this one on the cattle. I didn   t know about it until my     Shane.      grandson. He had mentioned it before, but I just kind of,    Well,  probably not.    I   m one of these that don   t like to be obligated. Anyway,  I got to finding out what people was getting, and then I got real  interested in it.  Drought relief.  That drought relief, and so we   re going up next month, I think, and talk  to them. We got an appointment with them.  I know you do a lot more cattle these days, but through the years have  you ever had crop insurance?  No.  No, never have.  Was there ever a point where you thought you were going to lose the  farm?  2 8  D. Peters  Nykolaiszyn  D. Peters  S. Peters  D. Peters  Nykolaiszyn  D. Peters  S. Peters  D. Peters  S. Peters  Finchum  S. Peters  Finchum  S. Peters  Finchum  S. Peters  Nykolaiszyn  I don   t think so.  Okay.  I don   t believe so.  No.  I guess there   s always a way if you   re willing to sacrifice a little bit.  How many children do you have?  Three, we had four boys and lost the second one. Then we had three  boys. Two of them   one of them lives right over there, and the other  one lives back over here.  One in Texas.  One in Texas, and a grandkid. My oldest grandson   s right over here.  One lives in the old place, and one lives in Norman.  Were they involved with 4-H growing up?  They never had 4-H here     FFA?     not even when our boys were in school. I think about the time we  moved back here in    73, they had to make the choice between auto  mechanics or 4-H and FFA, and they went with auto mechanics. Then  eventually the auto mechanics went out, too, as the school got smaller.  Our school is only, like, 350 kids, total.  First through twelve?  Yes. Well, I guess they probably don   t count the kindergarten in that  amount and the four-year-old class. They have four-year-old class and  then Head Start, also. We used to have the Diaper Brigade, but the   the  Tiny Tigers, I think   Diaper Tigers, I think was what they called them,  which we   re the Maud Tigers. Anyway, for a few years they had that,  and it was nice, childcare in the school system. It was pretty handy for  parents, especially teachers.  Well, how have your neighbors changed through the years?  2 9  D. Peters  S. Peters  D. Peters  S. Peters  D. Peters  Nykolaiszyn  D. Peters  S. Peters  Nykolaiszyn  D. Peters  S. Peters  Nykolaiszyn  S. Peters  D. Peters  Well, there   s still a few out there, very few of the old-timers, but it   s  changed a lot. So much of the land has been chopped up into smaller  parcels, and we   ve got people living out in that part of the country. I  don   t have any idea who they are.  But we still have some of the basic families, too. There   s three other  centennial farms in that same area.  We have one neighbor that, especially while Mother was still alive, he  was very helpful, him and his wife. I didn   t have to worry about if  Mother needed something. All she had to do was call him, and they   d be  there in a flash. They lived just a little ways from her. I guess there   s  probably other neighbors that would do the same thing, and I know we  had one young couple over there   I say young. I mean younger than  what we were. I was burning something over there one day, and he saw  the smoke, and he come running, whipped in there.  Called for help.  Said,    Well, I just saw that smoke and knew it was something close to  the house here, so I come over to check you out.    I said,    Well, I  appreciate it.    You don   t find that everywhere.  I haven   t noticed it, driving out here today   we haven   t really been in  this part of the state a whole lot. Has oil and gas played a major role in  the area?  Yes.  That   s what dried the town up was when the oil and gas in    82, you  know, whenever they   . Yeah, it really played a major part in keeping  Maud alive.  But not so much today?  Well     Yeah, we still have some, and there   s several that are employed still with  it, but all phases of it   actually, like I said, our son builds locations.  Okay.  There   s still several units, you know, like the     It   s surprising. I didn   t think it   d ever happen, but they   ve come in here  and leased up land that I never would   ve thought they   d leased. You  3 0  Nykolaiszyn  D. Peters  Nykolaiszyn  D. Peters  S. Peters  Nykolaiszyn  S. Peters  D. Peters  S. Peters  D. Peters  Finchum  D. Peters  Finchum  D. Peters  Finchum  D. Peters  Nykolaiszyn  know, that   s still     Has it drove up the price of land in the area?  Yes, it has.  And has that hurt or helped some people?  I don   t know. If you   re wanting to buy, it hurts.  Depends on whether you   re selling or buying.  Exactly.  We don   t sell, but we would like to buy, maybe, but that   s     This used to be the cheapest place to buy land of anywhere I knew of. I  keep up with those farm magazines. They tell you what the land   . This  area right here, you   d be surprised what I gave for this farm. You   d be  really surprised. It was cheap.  According to nowadays    prices.  You cannot even look at land for that now, and in the last ten years, it  has really skyrocketed.  You keep the mineral rights?  What we had, yes. I won   t never sell minerals.  You mentioned getting a spanking behind the slush pit. Was that having  to do with oil, too?  Yes, that     It was on the property?     that place had nine wells on it at one time. Amerada came in there and  drilled nine wells. When they pulled out and plugged the wells, Amerada  guy told my dad, he said,    We figure we got 13 percent of the oil that   s  down there.    That was way back during when they were drilling in    39,     40, somewhere in there. Technology now is so much greater than what  it was then. Besides that, they   re doing the horizontal bit, too, out there.  Well, are there any food memories, anything you really enjoyed that  your mother cooked, any recipes she passed on down to you?  3 1  S. Peters  D. Peters  S. Peters  D. Peters  Nykolaiszyn  S. Peters  Nykolaiszyn  D. Peters  Nykolaiszyn  S. Peters  D. Peters  S. Peters  D. Peters  S. Peters  D. Peters  S. Peters  D. Peters  S. Peters  Oh, yeah.  You handle that part. (Laughter)  Well, one thing she did that always   I love mincemeat pie, but  mincemeat when we bought it was either from the store in a jar or the  little square, and you added water and cooked. She made meat  mincemeat, her own, and it was delicious. Pear preserves.  Mother had potatoes and green beans and corn. It didn   t take a whole lot  to satisfy me.  Did she have a technique for killing a chicken?  Killing the chicken? (Laughter) The old-fashioned.  How would she do it?  She   d either wring its neck or chop its head off, one of the two.  Everybody seems to have their own technique.  Right, put its head under a stick     I never did any of that, wringing their neck.     a broomstick, yeah, and pick it, scald it, and yeah. Killing hogs, did  y   all kill   I guess y   all killed hogs, too.  Yeah.  Yeah, did their own. The community, the men in the community     There   s a chain still up in that tree out there where we   d kill the hogs.     would get together and do them. Same way with butchering a calf,  and we   d take it to the locker in town before you had deep freezes and  then can part of it.  My mother   s mother had a way of making cornbread that was out of this  world. She could can beef that was really good. We   d go up there and  eat with them a lot. Man, she would make a good dish out of that canned  beef they had.  Don was talking about going to the cellar a while ago. When we went to  3 2  D. Peters  S. Peters  D. Peters  S. Peters  Nykolaiszyn  D. Peters  S. Peters  S. Peters  Nykolaiszyn  D. Peters  Nykolaiszyn  D. Peters  S. Peters  the cellar, we always went to my aunt   s, and we couldn   t wait to get  over there and get in the pickles or whatever she had that you could eat.  (Laughs) We   d sit and eat pickles while it stormed. They canned beef,  chicken, sausage. Fried your sausage, and packed it in a jar, and then  pour grease on it, and turn it upside down. The grease would form a seal  beside your lid. All those things.  You know, I don   t ever remember being hungry. That   s one thing I can  say about Mother and Dad. They always had food. They might not have  had a whole lot of money, but we had food.  It might be rabbit or squirrel.  Yeah, I can remember one day it had snowed, and the snow was about  eight or ten inches deep. My uncle Anton came over and got Daddy, and  I don   t know whether Uncle John was with them or not, but they went  rabbit hunting. They come back with the awfulest bunch of rabbits I ever  did see. They fixed them some way or another. I don   t know.  Fried them. That   s what my grandmother did, too. Squirrel, loved fried  squirrel.  What   s your favorite time on the farm? Do you have a favorite season, a  favorite time of day?  Oh, I like the early mornings and the late of the evening, when the sun  goes down and kind of cools off.  Gets so dark, you have to come in and quit working.  My favorite season is in spring when things start beginning greening up,  I guess would be my favorite time.  Well, looking at the next one hundred years, what do you hope happens  to the family farm?  Well, I hope it   s still in the family, and I hope the government don   t  mess around and mess the farm life up totally. It   s kind of scary. Really  is.  Anything else you want to share with us before we look at your  photographs?  Well, I     Think of any more stories?  3 3  D. Peters  S. Peters  Nykolaiszyn  S. Peters  Nykolaiszyn  S.
