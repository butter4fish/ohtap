Speaker 2: She was born in Kentucky, raised in Kentucky basically.  Went to school there.  And left to be with my father [Julian O'Banion], my father came to Kentucky.  And where his people were from.  And she left there and came to Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 1: Did she grow up as an only child, did she have siblings?
Speaker 2: No, she had brothers and sisters.  She had a, a baby brother and three older sisters, three or four older sisters, four old, older sisters.
Speaker 1: And they all grew up also in Kentucky.
Speaker 2: In Kentucky.  One of 'em moved to Los Angeles [California].  The oldest girl moved to Los Angeles.  And the other three were in Kentucky.
Speaker 1: So your mother was the only one that moved to Chicago.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And do you remember any stories that, that, that she told you about her growing up as a child, or stories that she told you during the time and era that, that she grew up?  About her life.
Speaker 2: Only thing I can think about is just her, her days on the farm, you know.  She grew up in a, in a country, country environment.  Called the area they grew up in called it Kink Town [ph.], it was right down--right--really not in Maysville, it's right down the road from Maysville, maybe about three or four miles from Maysville.  And most of my relatives were in that area.  The church, there were two churches.  There was a Baptist church and a Methodist church right across the street from each other.  She went to a one room schoolhouse, which was right across the, right across the hill from her house where she grew up.  Her father [William Breckenridge] was a hunter, basically went out, trapper, hunting and trapping.  And her mother [Sadie Breckenridge] was a house, house mother, you know.  Basically, yeah.
Speaker 1: Do you remember any songs that she would sing to you as a child growing up or any--
Speaker 2: My mother was a songbird.  She sang everything.  I mean my--some of my greatest memories as, as a little boy is laying in the kitchen where the sun came through the window in the morning and touch the kitchen floor and being at her feet while she was singing, preparing breakfast or doing other things, household chores.  She was known in the church, my church as, as a--one of the major soloists.  She was singing gospel before we knew of Mahalia Jackson.  She was stylizing hymns, old hymns and singing 'em in the style of Mahalia Jackson before we knew of Mahalia Jackson.
Speaker 1: And this is all in Kentucky before you--coming to Chicago.
Speaker 2: No, this is in Kentucky and Chicago, yes.
Speaker 1: Because Mahalia Jackson had a rich legacy here in Chicago.
Speaker 2: In Chicago, yes, yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Do you remember any of the songs that your mother would sing to you?
Speaker 2: Not sing to me as such.  She sang a song at the church that we were at, trying to think of that song.  I can't think of it to save my life at this moment, "Does Jesus Care."  She sang, yes "Does Jesus Care" was one of her favorite songs, gospel song.
Story_ID: 112086
Speaker 1: And what about your, your father's side of the family?  Could you state and spell your father's name?
Speaker 2: His name was Julian Clifford O'Banion, Sr.  J-U-L-I-A-N, Clifford, C-L-I-F-F-O-R-D O'Banion, Capital O'B-A-N-I-O-N, and Sr.  He was born in Boston, Massachusetts.  Just reading last night his mother [Mary Palmer O'Banion] came up from, from North Carolina to Boston where I think she met, met his father [J. Winnie O'Banion].  And his father was from, originally from someplace in Ohio, originally.
Speaker 1: And then he later moved to Kentucky?
Speaker 2: No, my father left Boston.  They sent him to live with his relatives in Kentucky, and that's where he met my mother.  But he was a, really a Bostonian.  He has a quite a, quite a history of things that he did, you know.
Speaker 1: And O'Banion, that name, that's a very unique name.  Did either of your parents tell you about the origin of that name?
Speaker 2: No they didn't.  I, I surmise that that was somebody in Kentucky, some family in Kentucky, maybe a farm in Kentucky that they had the name O'Banion, probably the people who owned the farm.  And they used that name because that's where most of the O'Banions are, from that area of the country, Kentucky.  There are a bunch of O'Banions in Indianapolis [Indiana] also.  Some of them are my relatives.
Story_ID: 112087
Speaker 1: And your name, Delano is very unique.  Did your mother [Sarah Breckenridge O'Banion] even mention how she--what inspired her to name you Delano?
Speaker 2: Well as I understand it later, named us for a few days and Roosevelt, Franklin Delano Roosevelt was voted into office over [Thomas] Dewey.  Think the headlines at that time said "Dewey Wins the Election" [sic, Dewey Defeats Truman].  And overnight, Franklin Delano Roosevelt won the election, 1936.  And I was named after him.
Speaker 1: You said you were nameless for a few days?
Speaker 2: For a few days, yeah.  Trying to figure out what to name me, you know.
Speaker 1: And it was because of Roosevelt's election that that was an inspiration for your mother.
Speaker 2: I guess that's what they--how they did it, you know.  But I was always told that I was named after him.
Story_ID: 112088
Speaker 1: And on your father [Julian O'Banion]'s side or your mother [Sarah Breckenridge O'Banion]'s side, did you have any information on your grandparents?  Did your parents--did you know your grandmother on your mother's side?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I remember my grand--I believe as a fact as little boys we went to Kentucky when we were real small, regularly.  And stayed at my [maternal] grandmother [Sadie Breckenridge]'s house, which is you know, we, we stayed--we slept in the attic.  Was basically a, you know a shack down there.  It wasn't, wasn't like the shacks you see in some other parts of the country, but it was a house.  Most like a log cabin.  And I remember very, very much my, my brother, my grandmother and my grandfather [William Breckenridge] on my mother's side were not living together.  He had a, a house on the same hill about maybe a football field away from her house.  And in the morning he'd come in with trap and possums and coons and stuff and she would fix them for breakfast.  And it was real warm.  No, no electricity, outhouse, that kind of thing, you know.  Back in those days that's what it was done in Kentucky.
Speaker 1: And approximately how far back can you trace your family history?
Speaker 2: I have not even begun to try to trace my family history.  My oldest son called me about a week or so ago asking me some things about my history.  He's doing a, a research on it right at this moment, you know, at this time rather.  But I had not bothered with it.  Was not--really wasn't that important to me at the, at the--now it is sort of important.  But it was never, it's never been an issue with me.
Speaker 1: And do you remember your grandparents on your father's side?
Speaker 2: My grandmother [Mary Palmer O'Banion] and my grandfather [J. Winnie O'Banion].  My grandmother came to Chicago [Illinois] a couple of times when we were small.  She basically stayed and lived in Boston [Massachusetts]  and made her transition in Boston.  My grandfather was here in Chicago, and he had a couple of brothers that lived here in Chicago and they use--he used to come past my house all the time when we were young.  He and my father and his uncle would play cards and stuff.  And I remember, you know, that in our living room.  And we would sit around, the little boys, and play at their feet and stuff like that, you know.
Speaker 1: Do you remember any of the stories that either of your grandparents on your mother's or your father's side would tell you about their history?
Speaker 2: I guess my parents were so busy trying to make a living, you know, they didn't have time to set down and tell you about the stories of how, you know, my grandfather and my grand--my, my mother used to talk about she was a African, African queen.  She used to tell me that all the time.  And she was, she was an African queen.  Her grandmother told her that her tribe was Kush, you know she's from Kush.  That's basically all I remember from that you know.
Speaker 1: And were there any traces of the ancestors on your father's side?
Speaker 2: No, no.  My father from Boston, and his mother's from--I just found out, you know, from my stepmom [Ethel O'Banion] that his mother was a slave girl down in North Carolina.  And when the people moved, went up north, they took her, took her little girl--took her as a little girl to play with their daughter.  That's how she wound up in Boston, you know.  As a companion child.
Speaker 1: But on your mother's side, your grandmother remembered her mother as being an African queen.
Speaker 2: My mother remembered.  No she, she would talk about it.  She was an African queen.  And she would talk about her, her grandmother, somebody in her family would tell her that the family originated, was from Kush.
Speaker 1: From Kush.  But--and, and your knowledge, the Kush--you're not familiar with what country that is from.
Speaker 2: It's in Africa, that's all I know.  Kushites.
Speaker 1: The Kushites.
Story_ID: 112089
Speaker 1: Well tell me, are there any sights, sounds or smells that would remind you of, of growing up?
Speaker 2: There was some smells around Christmastime that every now and then I'll get a whiff of something like that, foods and taste, you know taste a certain--tastes you can get in your mouth.  Some of those will never come back, you know.  But you get those in your mouth and in your mind and you--you know when you, when you hear that or smell that, that fragrance it immediately flashes back to your childhood, at least my childhood.  Sounds, no.  Music was basically all I--those are sounds I live with, basically music.  Church, church choir, sang in the church choir.  Grew up in a church that had a strong musical heritage.  My mother [Sarah Breckenridge O'Banion] sang in the gospel choir, we had a senior choir and ultimately I joined the youth choir, which was quite--considerable, considerably large and did a lot of classical and anthems and spirituals and that kind of music.
Speaker 1: What about some of the sights that, that you could recall that would bring back some of your childhood memories?
Speaker 2: I was born on South Park [now the Washington Park and Jackson Park neighborhoods in Chicago].  I was born at Cook County but, but I lived--my family lived at--a family, reverend and his wife, on South Park, in the 3300 block on South Park.  And my church is still on South Park.  So I'm not too far from where I, where I was born and raised.  Now it's known as King Drive of course.  But at that time it was the Park, it was really a park.  They had bushes and stuff like that.  You could--in fact somewhere I have a baby picture, I tried to find that before I came here today, with me standing by a bush in, in the middle of South Park, the boulevard there.  But we ultimately moved out of, out of the people's house where my mother and father lived.  Moved around the corner to 34th and Vernon.  And most of my young, young life was spent at 34th and Vernon.  Where Lake Meadows [Chicago, Illinois] is presently built.
Story_ID: 112090
Speaker 1: And this particular time, could you share some of your very early memories, or the earliest memory that you can recall?
Speaker 2: My earliest memories are I remember being a precocious child.  Having two brothers, two older brothers who both were very, very smart, very talented.  And my baby brother and I were paired up.  My oldest brother, I was my oldest brother's boy and my baby brother was my next oldest brother's boy.  Four years' difference between my two oldest brothers and myself and my younger brother.  So we were--we actually had a good time as kids.  We were poor, quite naturally.  I remember moving into the, into the flat on 34th Street.  I think there was a big green box as our first furniture.  A big green box that sat in the middle of the living room floor.  I remember the, the coal, coal stove in the living room and a little two eye, two eyelet coal stove in the kitchen that supposedly heated water and provide for the cold in the kitchen, for the warmth in the kitchen.  The area was, you know, basically--you don't think about it as a slum.  We didn't think about it as a slum then because people lived in the--all the whole block was filled with houses and it was a neighborhood.  We grew up there.  Friends across the street.  There was a baby doll building on the corner of 34th and Vernon, on the--in the 3300 block.  People who had good means, were well off, lived in that building.  Some people across the street.  You know people--the incomes were different.  Our family was basically a--mother [Sarah Breckenridge O'Banion] was a maid at that time and my father [Julian O'Banion] worked at International Harvester as a laborer.  So they weren't very, very rich or anything like that.  We didn't have a lot of money.  And there were four boys.
Story_ID: 112091
Speaker 1: Could you tell me more about the--your neighborhood?
Speaker 2: Well 34th and Vernon there was a, a series of houses, three flats on either side.  We all went to Doolittle School.  People either went to Hartzell [Memorial United Methodist] Church, which is 30th and Prairie, 3011 Prairie, or Olivet [Baptist] Church which was 30th and King Drive, or Martin Luther--it was South Park [Way] at the time.  I at one point went to--remember going to nursery school in the old Olivet, in the Olivet Church when I was a very, very, very young.  Some of my earliest moments of being a member of that is that I could never sleep during the day time.  And in nursery school they required you to take a nap.  And if you didn't take a nap, you had oatmeal.  You took a nap, you had, what is it, fruit cocktail.  I never got fruit cocktail.  They would automatically just give me oatmeal 'cause they knew I didn't, I wouldn't go to sleep in the afternoon.
Speaker 1: And what do you think that was the cause of?
Speaker 2: Because they just watched me.  They knew I did--I just--I was never a sleeper and I never got afternoon sleeps--sleeping you know.  My baby brother did.  We both went to the same nursery school, but I almost religiously got oatmeal.  I love both oatmeal and, and fruit cocktail today.
Story_ID: 112092
Speaker 1: Well how were your holidays spent?  Tell me something about--
Speaker 2: Holidays, well in the situation we were in as, as a not very well-to-do family.  My mother [Sarah Breckenridge O'Banion] working at--in the white folk's kitchen, Jewish kitchens, we often had Christmases that lasted for a whole week because they would get us whatever they could at, at the beginning of--before Christmas night, you know, Christmas day I remember staying up watching for Santa Claus, all that kind of stuff.  And we could--whatever we got we, we appreciate it, you know we didn't really have any problem with whatever it was.  It was those nickel and dime toy was okay, you know.  And then at the next two or three days my mother would come up with some more toys.  Either some toys that were discarded by the, by the people she worked for, or something that they were able to afford.  But we always had a Christmas tree and basically warm environment as a, as a youngster, you know.  Even we didn't really know you were poor, you know, 'cause people just all lived the same kind of--basically the same kind of way.
Story_ID: 112093
Speaker 1: Well tell me about you as a little adolescent, Delano.
Speaker 2: Adolescent.  I--in grammar school, I went to Doolittle Grammar School [now Doolittle Elementary School] and I had a very, very rich musical experience there.  Philip Doolittle had a--they did dramatic productions, they did "Scrooge."
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: Okay.  As I was saying my grammar school, Doolittle Grammar School was quite a, quite a artistic school, you know.  Back then we had 5,000 students.  We had--we were a bit larger than, than the town of Joliet [Illinois] at the time.  I graduated in 1951 from there, but that--my early years at Doolittle, we were on half a day, you know, one part, one group would come in the morning, the other group would come in the evening.  But in spite of all of that, being that size and etc., they put on plays regularly.  They always had a Christmas program and a Spring concert.  We sang in four part harmony.  We had some magnificent teachers.  We had some ignorant teachers, but we had some magnificent black teachers there who were really, really made sure that we got an education as such.  And I said before I was rela--relatively precocious.  I could read and write before I went to grammar school, before I went to school at all.  Had an older brother [Lincoln Levi O'Banion] who passed in 1948, and he was real skilled in both art and music.  He sang and had a scholarship at, at Chicago--at the Art Institute [of Chicago] before he graduated from grammar school.  He was fourteen when he passed.  And he had been at the Art Institute for maybe about a year or two years or so.  Very, very talented and when he passed, I wanted to be just like him.  So I started singing.  I drew a little bit, that kind of thing.  But that was a--that was one of the turning points in my family life because no one knew about death at that point, up to that point.  He died of cancer, 1948, so things kind of got mixed up there in the family.  But after that, after his death, ultimately I sang.  I went to--I remember going to my church pastor and asking him could I sing the following year in honor of his, in honor of his death.  You know I sang the Lord's Prayer, which was the beginning of my career as a singer in the church.
Speaker 1: Now what year is this basically?
Speaker 2: Nineteen forty, forty-nine [1949].
Speaker 1: So during the time that you were in--the time that you were in elementary school was from the early '40s [1940s] until the--
Speaker 2: 'Bout '40 [1940], what is it-'43 [1943] to '51 [1951], something like that, yeah.
Story_ID: 112094
Speaker 1: Well did you have a favorite subject other than just singing?  Were there any other subjects that you enjoyed or that you excelled in?
Speaker 2: In grammar school? No, I had no specifics there.  I just kind of like step walked through grammar school.  It wasn't like something I really enjoyed.  We had some bullies there, that's--you were always aware of the bullies, that they were gonna do something to you.  We had a, a teacher, my fifth grade teacher was quite an aggressive and not, not really a good teacher.  So he, he was probably a turn-off.  And I made it through grammar school.  I had good grades, I was able to go to high school.  We only had three high schools you could go to at that time.  That was Doolittle, I mean not Doolittle.  But there was Phillips [High School], Dunbar [High School] and DuSable [High School].  Had to either go to, you know the black kids couldn't go to--couldn't go north or go far south.  If you had--were lucky, you had somebody that lived out, around Hyde Park [High School].  A few were at Hyde Park, a few were at Englewood [High School].  But mostly we were at those three schools, Phillips, DuSable and Dunbar.  And it wasn't until I got to DuSable, I mean went to--went to Phillips, that I began to find my way, you know.  I--my second year at Phillips I joined the band, some fellows from grammar school with me.  We called ourselves the Three, Three Musketeers, we went and joined the band.  And that was the beginning of my mus--really the beginning of my music career.
Story_ID: 112095
Speaker 1: And what instrument did you play?
Speaker 2: I played clarinet.  I played a--band teacher asked me could I afford to buy an instrument.  I said no.  'Cause we were poor.  And so he said I tell you what, I need a bass clarinet player, he said take this clarinet and showed me how to hold it, how to play it.  Gave me a book.  Said take it and if you are able to play this, then I'll--you won't have to buy an instrument, you'll play the bass clarinet in the band.  And I took the instrument home and I lived with that instrument almost solidly.  Every, every minute I was at home, I was playing the clarinet.
Speaker 1: Bass clarinet.
Speaker 2: No, the regular clarinet, regular clarinet.  He gave me the clarinet and about a month after I took it home he put me in the intermediate band, you know.  I finished the book and was well on my way.  And by my second semester in band I was in intermediate band and the concert band playing bass clarinet, you know.  So I had a good time.
Speaker 1: And who was your music teacher at this time?
Speaker 2: Mr. Earl Madison.  One of the greatest men in the world, really great man.  And simultaneously I was, I was so--like I said I started singing solos in my church.  And my church had this fantastic youth choir.  And I was blessed to have some people there that really kind of nurtured me into singing, in my singing.  I was already singing, but they nurtured me in my singing.  One was a guy who's known, known as Nathaneal McLin.  Lena McLin, Dr. Lena McLin was his wife, was his wife.  But he was the--just both come to Hartzell [Memorial United Methodist Church] to church as they weren't, they weren't married at the time.  But he was a great baritone, bass, bass baritone singer.  And I was up under his wing most of my early years in the choir.  And patterned my voice after his voice and started singing the same songs he sang.  He sang Messiah, I was singing the Messiah when I was fourteen.  Singing the bass solo of the Messiah when I was 14.  And that's--and then got a scholarship to, to Sherwood Music School based on my singing ability.  And I was still in high--I was a sophomore, a junior in high school.  And I studied with Ma--Madame [Else] Arendt at Sherwood Music School until I graduated from high school.
Speaker 1: How do you spell Arendt, Madame Arendt?
Speaker 2: A-R-D-E-N, A-R-E-N-D-T, Arendt, Elsa Harthan Arendt.  She was the vice president at Sherwood at the time, and also taught music there.
Speaker 1: And did you take music theory at this, this age of your life, or was it just mostly--
Speaker 2: No, I didn't know nothing about music theory until I got to college.
Speaker 1: Theory meaning, theory meaning drawing of the notes and writing.
Speaker 2: No, no, no.  We didn't have time for that at Phillips.
Speaker 1: So everything was, was basically mostly just not mo--but there's a word they--rote singing and rote performing?
Speaker 2: No, it was rote singing in the choir until I got into the band.  And once I got in the band, you know I was playing the bass clarinet, and then I started playing bassoon, I did play bassoon.  And at that point, I began to read, I began to understand notes.  It wasn't until I started playing bassoon that I knew what the notes, names of the notes, A through G.  'Cause I never really when I was playing clarinet, even though I was in the band, concert band playing a lot of bass clarinet, I never really knew what a, what a E was or a A was.  I just knew where the fingering was for those notes.  So that was my theory.  It wasn't till I went away to college that I had a theory class.
Story_ID: 112156
Speaker 1: Yeah, about your elementary school [Doolittle Grammar School] again.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Were there any favorite teachers that you had prior to, to high school?
Speaker 2: Yes, there were several.  There was Ms. Clark [ph.] who was the eighth grade music teacher.  Ms. Malone [ph.] was the seventh, sixth or seventh, lower grade music teacher.  I think she stopped at seven, at sixth grade.  Ms. Clark too were seventh and eighth grade.  And there was Ms. Lawson [ph.] who was my eighth grade teacher.  And these teachers probably had greater, greater impact on, as a grammar school kid, you know because they insisted you do the right thing and of course the music was, was the thing that I really enjoyed tremendously at that time.
Speaker 1: So these were some of your favorite teachers prior to high school.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: And you were telling us a story about 'Macbeth' a few minutes ago.
Speaker 2: Well Ms. Lawson was my English teacher.  She was the English teacher and I, I had somehow picked up a book at home with Shakespeare plays in it and started reading.  And started with 'Macbeth.'  And became intrigued with the three witches.  And so I run to school with the book to ask the teacher could I teach 'Macbeth' to the class.  We're gonna do a play.  'Cause, 'cause they were doing plays.  They did 'Scrooge' and a couple of other plays about there, you know so she said okay, you know.  And I tried to teach the class, selected some kids and give 'em the--pass the book around.  And of course it was way over our heads, you know, way over my head and everybody else's head.  So we never really did that.  But it was good that she allowed me to do that, you know.  Most teachers would have said you can't do that, forget it, you know.  But she allowed me to do that.
Story_ID: 112157
Speaker 1: So that was the beginning of your conducting, basically, trying to conduct a little--
Speaker 2: Well I was always trying to lead or do something, you know in terms of what I was doing.  And when I went to, when I went to Phillips High School [Chicago, Illinois] and for the first year, me and my two partners, we called ourselves 'The Three Musketeers'.  We kind of like wandered around, not doing too much of anything.  We walked to school together and leave, leave school together.  And then finally one day one of 'em said let's go join the band.  And both these guys were very naturally skilled.  Orville Watts played the marimba.  His father taught him, or somehow he had learned how to play the marimba before he went to Phillips.  And John Lillibridge had natural ability as a drummer, just natural, you know you could see his tap out things on the table.  And so the three of us went up to the band room to join the band.  And I, not having any of those skills, we wanted to play--I wanted to play drums, but I didn't have any of the skills to do that.  And that's how come the, the guy [Earl Madison] offered me the clarinet.  You know you play the clarinet and I'll let you play bass clarinet in the concert band although you can't--'cause every kid bought their, they bought their trumpets and their saxophones and their clarinets at that point.  You know how we did it, I don't know, but they did.  But I--my family couldn't afford it.  Thus, I got in the band.  Then I, once I got in the band, yeah, 'cause I was a tall kid he said you can perhaps be a drum major.  And so I started thinking about being a drum major.  And then I was so precocious on my instrument, he asked me would I teach--you know give you a clarinet player that somebody's just starting to play clarinet, you go help that girl, go help that boy, you know.  And finally I started helping trumpets and saxophone players and drummers and flute players to learn their instruments.  And then pretty soon I worked my way up to being his assistant.  So I was a student assistant.  He allowed me to direct the concert band.
Speaker 1: That early in life.
Speaker 2: And I had the intermediate band, you know, and most, most of the time I directed them, intermediate band, taught the kids how to play their horns.  He was very effective, very, very good teacher.  Very good teacher.
Speaker 1: And what came out of that is that everything was by ear, you just adapted, learning these instruments by ear.
Speaker 2: No, I just had the ability to, to you know, I mean I've studied him.  You know, whatever he did, I did.  He was my men--see back then you didn't have mentors, you know.  He wasn't a mentor as such, but he was a mentor in today's, today's nomenclature.  I studied everything he did.  I talked like him, walked like him.  When I directed the band, I directed the band like him.  I just--I mean I was on same wavelength with him.  That's what kind of person he was.  But most people today, I don't think too many band directors would allow a student that kind of latitude.  He was able to do that.  Same as Ms. Lawson, my grammar school teacher allowed me latitude to do what I wanted to do at that particular time, although it was not successful.  He allowed me latitude to do, you know to, to, just to grow, you know without standing over my shoulder, beating me across the head with what you can't do.  People just let, let me do what I wanted to do. And the same thing with my church choir.  I ultimately became the assistant director there, too.  I didn't know music as such, but I knew music in my head.  I heard something and watched the band director, watched the choir director Mr. Campbell, Mr. James T. Campbell was our choir director.  I could do exactly what they did, you know.
Speaker 1: Just by emulating.
Speaker 2: Just by emulating, yes, imitating, you know.  And I absorbed it (unclear) was, was enough to get me a scholarship to, to Sherwood [Music School, Chicago, Illinois] and ultimately a scholarship to Fisk University [Nashville, Tennessee], you know.  Music scholarships.
Story_ID: 112158
Speaker 1: Could you tell me more about that--how before going to Fisk University [Nashville, Tennessee] and being director of this band, learning to play different instruments, how did that give you a higher grasp on the instruments prior to college?  Was that the reason you went to college, to major in music?
Speaker 2: No, the--it was just--I was in the band room one day and I had sung for Dr. John Work [III] who was the director of the Fisk Jubilee Singers.  And he wrote back to, to Phillips [High School, Chicago, Illinois] asking them could I--he was interested in my, my coming to Fisk to be in the Jubilee Singers.  And he wrote and asked, or called the principal there and asked her about me coming down to Fisk and she told him he can't afford to go to Fisk.  You know his parents, she knew our situation.  She knew my mother [Sarah Breckenridge O'Banion] and my two brothers had gone to Phillips, Phillips too.  And so he wrote me a letter, offered me a scholarship to Fisk, and ultimately got some of his friends to stand behind the scholarship.  I was not a scholar.  I was a C student, to say the least, at the most.  But somehow he offered me this scholarship and these guys, Dr. Winston and Dr. Ziegler [ph.] in Chicago, and Dr. Matthew Walker in Nashville, put up, put up the seed money to allow me to go to Fisk, which was unusual.  I had a full scholarship to Fisk University to sing in the Jubilee Singers.  And that's where I, you know that's the music I had learned from Mr. [James T.] Campbell and from Mr. Earl Madison.  Those, that was, that was the basis of my, of my intellect musically, you know.  Just natural--I guess I was just naturally skilled musically, you know.
Speaker 1: And John Work was actually in Chicago to hear you sing?
Speaker 2: He came--the Jubilee Singers came to Chicago to do a concert and at the same time they were doing the concert, I think that Saturday or something they did the concert someplace.  And I didn't know what Fisk was.  I didn't know what the Jubilee Singers were.  But one of the girls who had sung in the choir with me at Hartzell [Memorial United Methodist Church] had gone to Fisk and she was in the Jubilee Singers.  She convinced some of them to come to Hartzell to hear me sing that Sunday afternoon.  We had a, happen to have a Sunday afternoon concert.  And I think I sang the 'Messiah' or sang something, Toreador Song or something.  And the three singers, three or four singers that came to hear me, insisted taking me back to let Mr. Work hear me.  And they, they were supposed to be leaving town going to Milwaukee [Wisconsin] or someplace, or maybe back to campus.  Mr. Work was very disturbed that they had held the bus up.  And when I got to the 50th on Indiana, there was a YMCA [Young Men's Christian Association] there, very, very nice, nice YMCA.  Had a parlor with a piano in it.  They took me in the parlor and my pianist from church played and I sang the 'Messiah.'  And he--then a couple weeks later wrote me a letter, offered me a scholarship to Fisk, and that's how I got there.
Story_ID: 112159
Speaker 1: And the Fisk Jubilee Singers, could you give us some historical background on the significance of the Jubilee Singers and their role in society during that particular time?
Speaker 2: At that particular time, they just--they were going around touring, singing at various places around the country.  But the original, the original Jubilee Singers got their start in 18, 1871.  Fisk [University, Nashville, Tennessee] was founded in 1863 [sic, 1866], in 1871 George L. White who was a teacher at Fisk, had heard these students singing the barracks, they had a--one of the original barracks from the Civil War was the first building on their campus.  And they at night would sing in there.  And he heard them singing these songs.
Speaker 1: So this--
Speaker 2: Negro spirituals, they're called Negro spirituals today.  But he heard them singing songs and gathered a group of them together and formulated a chorus and went around.  At the time, Fisk was very, very, very--almost broke, almost ready to close its doors because the idea of training blacks to--newly freed slaves--training them in school was not a thing that the southerners thought was a good thing.  And so the money was not coming in.  And so he took this group of students and began to tour the South and North and began to raise funds for Fisk.  And after singing--I can't remember this guy's name to save my life.  But one of the, one of the evangelist during the period of time they sang at this church in New York or Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], someplace, and launched--that, that's really kind of promoted them.  And they ultimately went to Europe and sang in front of the Queen Victoria, toured Europe and raised enough funds to build the first permanent building on a black college campus, which is still there, still stands, which is called Jubilee Hall.
Speaker 1: And they called themselves the Jubilee Singers at that time.
Speaker 2: Well they--that was the name they were, they were going under, the Jubilee Singers.  So they--the year of Jubilee, you know, the year of freedom.  And so that's how they got started in 1871.
Story_ID: 112160
Speaker 1: And this was only less than a decade after slavery ended.
Speaker 2: Oh yes, yes.  Our, our history as a people is just, you know, it's amazing because we obviously are blessed because if you think about the fact that these people came up off of slave camps.  Some of them walked miles to get to Nashville [Tennessee], or to Tuskegee [Alabama].  I know also was able to--had the bless--the blessings and the privilege of studying with William L. Dawson from Tuskegee [Institute, now Tuskegee University in Tuskegee, Alabama].  And from his history, yes, very, very rich.  He talked about walking miles to get there in order to get his education.  Ultimately became the department chairman there and wrote hundreds of range--arranged hundreds of musical compositions, Negro spirituals.  And as a--just a fantastic history that we have.  People coming out of slavery, full-grown adults, learning to read and learning to write and then going on and teaching other full-grown adults.
Story_ID: 112161
Speaker 1: This was also during the time when min--minstrelsy was a very known form during that time.  I'm surprised--
Speaker 2: Minstrelsy?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: There's a long history behind minstrelsy.  I don't even want to go into that, but there was, there was a time when, when the initial impact of the [Fisk] Jubilee Singers when they first started out that the white folks in the South just regarded them as another, just another minstrel, minstrel group.  And they were actually singing Negro spirituals, but not minstrel, minstrel songs, you know the black face kind of thing.  But you had to wonder about minstrelsy because why would white folks blacken their face to sing?  You have to wonder about that.  And I have a theory on that.  I believe the, the original entertainers were black people.  And in order for white folks to become entertainers, they had to blacken their face to be entertainers 'cause other white folks wouldn't accept them as entertainers.  That's fairly deep isn't it?
Speaker 1: Very, very much.
Story_ID: 112162
Speaker 1: So when the [Fisk] Jubilee Singers began touring the country singing spirituals, I guess that was a unique sound for anyone other than African Americans at that time.
Speaker 2: There's a play, there's, there are several instances where they were ready to be mobbed by lynch mobs.  People were ready to stone them and run them out of town.  And they began to sing.  And quell the crowds when they sang Negro spirituals.  People would stand up, literally start crying, you know, and their tracks--stop dead in their tracks to hear this beautiful music.  And they turned away from their evil ways.  That's, that's history.  That's not, that's not just--that's not a theory on my part now.  While I was in Fisk, at Fisk [University, Nashville, Tennessee] with the Jubilee Singers, I had the privilege in 1956 of touring Europe.  Negro spirituals is not a--were not songs that I really--we sang them in the church choir before I went to Fisk.  We sang all the regular songs that they sang, but we also sang Negro spirituals.  But they were not special to me at that point.  When I studied with Madame [Elsa Harthan] Arendt, she almost had to force me to sing Negro spirituals at the student recitals, you know 'cause that was not, you know particularly any part of music that I really--I was into classical music, I was into Beethoven and Handel and Bach and that kind of stuff.  And so I sang, I sang Negro spirituals but they weren't, they weren't special to me.  It was only after that experience at Fisk that the music really became special to me.  In Europe one of the things I remember definitely, we had three different concerts that we did.  We were supposed to do, we were supposed to do a all Negro spiritual concert, then we did some Palestrina, and some modern music.  And then we did a mix of, mix of the three, you know, the three different kinds of music.  And in Europe where we went from town to town, we did 66 concerts in 56 days in 1956.  And in Europe, whenever we sang the predominant choice was the Negro spiritual concert.  Almost all Negro spirituals.  A few work songs, a few camp songs, you know, but people really--and after we sang our first concert in Germany, it was standing room only across the entirety of Europe.  In England, Spain, Portugal, France, Sicily, Italy, all standing room.  People would literally be--like a, a--like a rock concert today.  People in Paris [France] on the--in the south of (unclear), people were, people were stationed behind us.  We're on the stage and they put platforms behind us so people could sit and watch us at the concerts.  These places would be--these huge halls would be filled with people to hear the Negro spirituals from the Jubilee Singers.  This is 1956.  And I began to think, you know, I mean over, over the years I mean I--since that time, you know, that this was really a strong statement, a strong-filled music that had a pathos, ethos, that really kind of, kind of stirred people to more than regular music would.  And when we got out of--when I got away--graduated from Fisk and came to Chicago [Illinois], we formulated the Jubilee Singers which specializes in, even now today, specializes in Negro spirituals.
Story_ID: 112163
Speaker 1: What about the spirituals that you think stirred the audience?  Do you think the lyrics or the melodies?  What do you think stirred the audience?
Speaker 2: It's a form of pathos that Europeans in these countries did not, even though the words might be printed out, you know, in the bulletin, in the program, would not understand the words as such.  No more than I would understand Russian if they sang it.  The closest thing to Negro spiritual in terms of that, that preaching, that center core of person, is the Russian, Russian music.  That's the closest thing to Negro spirituals.  It's something about the music; something the way it's sung, the way it's prepared, the way it's produced, that reach--reaches into the soul of people.  It's the real original soul music.  And the Europeans, whatever country we were in, we would see them crying.  They would stand and give us four or five ovations after each concert.  Sometimes we couldn't get off the stage.
Speaker 1: And this is--spirituals emerged prior to gospel, so there was no instruments, it was strictly a capella singing.
Speaker 2: It's all a capella singing.  Well you know spirituals is the, is the, is the foundation of all, I would say all modern Amer--American music.  It's the original, really the only original music outside of the music of the Indians, indigenous Indians here.  They had their music of course, but the music that was created here in this country--'cause people at that time, during the 1800s, 1700s were singing European music, you know.  Playing and singing European music.  But the music that was created by blacks in the slave camps or in the cotton fields, the original music.  And George White taking that music and putting it into performance actually became the first original music.  And at the time the Jubilee Singers, right after the Jubilee Singers sang at their first concert, that music was selling like, like the records the hit, hit parade today.  People were buying the music in Europe and in the United States.  That's a strong--that's a lot of history about that.  That was the original American music.  Out of that came jazz, out of that came blues, out of that of course came gospels.  And a lot of American music, modern music, you know popular music, has the same chord structure of the Negro spirituals.
Speaker 1: And ragtime perhaps because of the rhythm.
Speaker 2: Ragtime of course.  That was a--that was the next thing after, after spirituals, ragtime.
Speaker 1: Do they still have some of those early recordings, the cylinder recordings of the original Jubilee Singers?
Speaker 2: I don't know if they have any original recorders of the cylinder.  I know cylinder recordings, I don't know, I'm not certain of that.  I know they have recordings we made in Europe.  And we made some recordings in Nashville [Tennessee] when I was there [Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee] in '56 [1956], '55 [1955] through '59 [1959].  And then we did a recording in Texas, Word Record Company would have some recordings.
Story_ID: 112164
Speaker 1: So when you attended Fisk [University, Nashville, Tennessee], you went with the intended--intention of being a music major.  There was nothing else on your mind other than majoring in music at that time.
Speaker 2: Well, as--in fact I got sidetracked on that because I was talking about Earl Madison.  After Fisk had offered me the scholarship, I was, you know I was in a tizz.  I didn't know what I was gonna major in.  And I had been conducting a band and that kind of stuff.  And Mr. Madison said well you know you got the scholar--what you gonna do?  I said I don't know.  You wanna--what are you gonna be?  Said I don't know.  Said why don't you be a musician?  Bingo.  I had not thought about music as a way of making a living.  And actually at that time people discouraged musicians.  Said you can't earn any money being a musician.  Musician's life is terrible, you know.  And when I left school, I could tell all of my kids that I spent my entire life, except for the first four years of teaching, teaching music.  Put my sons through college, you know, as a musician.  Actually music is one of the, is one of the--it's a multibillion dollar industry.  It's a multibillion and people don't--they don't want, want you to think like that.  And it's kind of different now, but it's still a multibillion dollar industry.  I didn't make the multibillion dollars, I just barely survived.  But there are people out there making a lot of money with music.
Speaker 1: And at Fisk--the music school at Fisk was a very, very big music school, was it classical training only or what type of education did you receive in music as a Fisk music major?
Speaker 2: Well Fisk, when I came to Fisk, there was the--it was the second largest department, second or third largest department was--English, history and music.  Large, huge, huge department.  Fisk first off is a very small school at the time I was there, about 750 students.  So you had about maybe 35 or 40 kids in the Music Department.  So that gave it a large--that was a large department for the school.  Fisk is a liberal arts school.  The music department at that time turned out organists, pianists and singers, you know.  Didn't have an instrumental program.  So when I went down there, I had to change my, you know, change my style.  I didn't, didn't major in instrumental music, playing, me playing the horn or anything.  I just majored in vocal music.  And 'bout--beginning of my junior year I decided to go ahead and go into music education.  Took some education courses which allowed me to be able to come to Chicago [Illinois] and teach.
Story_ID: 112165
Speaker 1: And during the time that you were at Fisk [University, Nashville, Tennessee] as a part of the Jubilee Singers, did you have the occasion to conduct the choir or act assistant conductor at that time?
Speaker 2: I was Mr. [John] Work [III]'s assistant.  Again, again as, as I did in grammar school and high school, I positioned myself to study everything that he did.  And I was in charge of the male chorus, we sang, you know after a certain period.  We had--some guys would sing part of the concert.  And I was (unclear) rehearse them.  So that was part of it.  Then when William [L.] Dawson came from Tusk--when he came my senior year, he came to Fisk, I was his associate, assistant conductor of University Choir.  He was the conductor of the University Choir in my senior year and he let me, allowed me to conduct to the choir on several occasions.
Speaker 1: So Dawson came as a prof--as a professor at Fisk or a visiting professor?
Speaker 2: He was a visiting professor.  He came as a visiting professor.  He came, came there in my senior, my senior year to, to conduct a University Choir, 100-voice choir.  And it was probably one of the greatest experiences that I've had in terms of that Fisk experience, one of the greatest.
Speaker 1: At that time had he written as many compositions as he became known as, or was he very young?
Speaker 2: Yes.  He was--we'd been, we'd been singing his songs at Hartzell [Memorial United Methodist Church, Chicago, Illinois] before I knew what a, you know, before I knew anything about music.  We was singing his, his spirituals at Hartzell, 'Ezekial Saw De Wheel.'  A bunch of songs that he wrote, we would do, we would do it at Hartzell before I got out of grammar school actually, or high school.  So when he came there it was like seeing God, you know.  He was a man that I had been singing his music all these years and he was finally gonna be my conductor.  So it was quite, quite, quite, quite good.
Story_ID: 112166
Speaker 1: And the original person that, that took these twelve--originally twelve Jubilee Singers to--out of the country, George White, correct?
Speaker 2: George L. White.
Speaker 1: George White.
Speaker 2: Actually eight [sic, nine].
Speaker 1: Eight originals.  But then after John Work [III] took it up, it became twelve.
Speaker 2: Well it was diff--different.  We took, we took sixteen to Europe, seventeen to Europe actually when we went in '56 (1956).  The group can be anywhere from eight--first, the first Ju--the first John Work choral membership was eight people in 1961, '60 [1960], '61 [1961].  The group that I formed here in Chicago, the same people.  We have about fourteen now, varies, 14, 15, 13, 12, you know, according to who's available.
Speaker 1: And after--prior to John Work being the conductor of the, the Fisk Jubilee Singers, was he after George White, the original founder of the, these group of--
Speaker 2: No, George White, I don't know when he passed.  He was in 1871, you know, so he--John, John Work passed in 1963 [sic, 1967].  But he actually--I had the privilege of--on the 100th anniversary of the Jubilee Singers, 125th of the Fisk Jubilee Singers, I was honored as alumni, outstanding alumni at Fisk and I also had the opportunity of being selected to direct the Jubilee Singers in the anniversary concert at Ryman Auditorium.  And at the time they were doing what we're doing here now.  They were taking, taping the recollections of members of the former Jubilee Singers in Jubilee Hall.  They had a studio set up in Jubilee Hall.  And my son, who was a Jubilee Singer when he, when he went to Fisk [University, Nashville, Tennessee] and I, and dozens of other people came through there and were interviewed.  And when I sat in on one of the interviews, and this is a woman who was in the second group of Jubilee Singers.  Jubilee Singers kind of disbanded sometime during the '20s [1920s] or '30s [1930s], and John Work reorganized them in the '40s [1940s].  And so that he was the next--John Work, III--see there are five, six Works I think
Speaker 1: Really?
Speaker 2: Six John Works now, yeah.  John Work I, his grandfather, his second, his father, then he's the third.  Then he has John Work IV, and he has John Work his son, his son John Work V.
Speaker 1: But they weren't all affiliated with Fisk, Fisk University were they?
Speaker 2: All the way up to John Work, all the way up to John Work the Fourth.
Speaker 1: With the choir?
Speaker 2: They lived in Nashville, they lived in Nashville.  They were born and raised in Nashville.
Speaker 1: So then the lineage from, from, from George White to the Works was just straight from him to--
Speaker 2: No, I don't know if his father directed the Jubilee Singers or his grandfather directed the Jubilee Singers.  I know there were--
Speaker 1: Yeah, that was my question.
Speaker 2: That I think was your question.  I don't think they directed the Jubilee Singers.  I don't know who the Jubilee Singers director was after George L. White.  I'll have to find out; that's an interesting question, I'm glad you asked me that.
Story_ID: 110513
Speaker 1: So we were speaking about the differences in the spirituals and the effect the spirituals would have on--
Speaker 2: Have on people, right.
Speaker 1: Audiences.
Speaker 2: I think it's really original soul music that's, that's what I get from that.  It's the original soul music 'cause the Europeans would be moved.  White folks in the United States would be moved.  I mean we've sung the (unclear) chorales sung at concerts and people are in tears, you know.  Doesn't make any difference what, what nationality you are, it's an international music, Negro spirituals are.
Speaker 1: And, and considering that the Fisk Jubilee Singers toured the country and all over Europe, by the time in the 1940s when you were there in school--
Speaker 2: I wasn't there in 1940s.
Speaker 1: I'm sorry.  The time that, the time when you started there in the 1960s.
Speaker 2: Nineteen fifty-five [1955].
Speaker 1: Fifty-five [1955] through '59 [1959].
Speaker 2: Fifty-five [1955] through '59 [1959], yes.
Speaker 1: Yes, exactly.  During that time, the, the reputation had--was--had the reputation changed in terms of the Fisk Jubilee Singers being this prominent group that represented Fisk University [Nashville, Tennessee] or had, had the reputation--had they lost their reputation by that point?
Speaker 2: No.  It's just during the '50s [1950s] when I sang with the Jubilee Singers, there wasn't any, there wasn't any money being raised like when, when they went to Europe.  You know I guess those great, great grants and stuff that got, got back to Fisk.  But really on a substance, on you know, what do you call it, not substance, but sus--it was sustaining, sustaining the, the group.  When we went to Europe we didn't make any money, you know.  I don't know who made the money when we went to Europe, but Fisk didn't make any money at that time in '56 [1956] when we went to Europe.  But the thing about it is that all in all, it was just a matter of keeping the music alive, you know keeping the music alive and particularly in this day and age when people are really going hog wild over gospel, you know, or new age music, you know that whole thing.  So it's a matter of trying to keep this music first and foremost in the minds of people, particularly in the minds of black people.
Story_ID: 110514
Speaker 1: And many people would think that gospel and spirituals were the same.  How would you define the difference between a gospel song and, and a spiritual?
Speaker 2: Well gospel songs are basically composed by somebody who sat down at the piano or in a studio and made up the words and made up the, the music and put stuff together.  Spirituals were composed in a--a similar fashion.  They were--person working in the fields decided to sing, you know.  And made up a song as he was in the fields and people alongside him was join in on that song.  Oftentimes I remember reading from Mr. [John] Work [III] some of the, some of Mr. Work's works that when people died, that song died with them.  That song as they sang, they got to know--in the churches they got to know that group, got to be known as Sister So-and-so's song, Brother So-and-so's song.  And when that person, they didn't sing the song anymore.  Came out of the soul of a person, not--rather than somebody siting and writing the music.
Story_ID: 110515
Speaker 1: So during the time that you were growing up, what type of music did you have in your churches?  Could you tell me a little about your church?
Speaker 2: Well we had, we had, we had--at Hartzell [Memorial United Methodist Church in Chicago, Illinois] we had a gospel choir my mother [Sarah Breckenridge O'Banion] belonged to and they sang the gospel songs, they were written songs.  And you had a senior choir which sang anthems.  That's the great European type songs and Ameri--American type songs, anthems.  And you had the young people's choir which sang anthems and Negro spirituals, you know.  And basically that was it, that was what we did at Hartzell, you know.  Really not I'd say high class, but it's just a certain kind of music that used to permeate the churches.  Not only at Hartzell, but Olivet [Baptist Church, Chicago, Illinois].  You had Metropolitan [Community Church, Chicago, Illinois], they all had these great choirs that sang this anthem music.  We really kind of like did the European thing and the black face.
Speaker 1: But spirituals were not based upon the same model that hymns were based upon?
Speaker 2: No.  Spirituals were like--they--if I sang one of the--introduction to one of William [L.] Dawson's songs.  I got a crown up into that kingdom, ain't that good news?  I gotta crown up into that kingdom, ain't that good news?  I'm gonna lay down this world, gonna shoulder up my cross, gonna take it home to my Jesus, ain't that good news?  (Singing)  That came out of the soul of a person who was, you know, working in the field, you know.  I got a crown up in that kingdom.  This world is not too much of anything for me, but I got a crown up in that kingdom.  Gonna lay down this world.  Gonna shoulder up my cross, take it home to my Jesus, ain't that good news.
Story_ID: 110516
Speaker 1: And some of the songs that, that William [L.] Dawson wrote, they were all basic--mostly spirituals, or were some of them songs of European descent, like--
Speaker 2: Well William Dawson wrote one symphony.  And he probably wrote others that he didn't, didn't release, 'cause that's what he told me.  But this one symphony was the 'Negro Folk Symphony,' which was recorded by--Arturo Toscanini I think recorded it.  At that time he was in Chicago [Illinois].  He was a--in the Chicago Civic Orchestra playing trombone and blacks weren't allowed, you know to--he was the first black in that orchestra.  They weren't in the orchestras around the country.  And he wrote this composition and convinced Arturo Toscanini to use the Philadelphia Har--Philharmonic [Philadelphia Orchestra] to play it.  And that's recording out about, right now you can find it--you can get a recording of it.  But that was his, his symphonic work, which is based on Negro spirituals.  But a very, very fine work.
Speaker 1: And after he came from Tuskegee [Institute, now Tuskegee University in Tuskegee, Alabama] to, to Fisk University [Nashville, Tennessee], how long did he stay?  Was it only one, one year visiting or did he--
Speaker 2: He stayed there one year, just one year, yeah.
Speaker 1: And that was your senior year?
Speaker 2: That was my senior year, yes.
Speaker 1: And then after that, he went back to Tuskegee or Hampton [Institute, now Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia]?
Speaker 2: He was retired.  He was really retired.  At that time he was retired and he came out of retirement to do that.  He'd go around guest lecturing and conducting workshops, singing workshops around the country.  So that's what he was doing at that particular time.
Speaker 1: And at that time--
Speaker 2: He just, he just died recently.  Within the last ten years.
Story_ID: 110517
Speaker 1: And at that time it was very unique for African Americans to, to write art songs at that time.
Speaker 2: Well, not unique because they had been writing since turn of the century, you know.  A lot of music out there that was written by blacks that we didn't even know about, even like music of, of the ragtime artist, what's the guy's name?
Speaker 1: Scott Joplin.
Speaker 2: Scott Joplin, you know.  People didn't know Scott Joplin was black, you know.  And these people wrote all kinds of music, art songs, classical songs, you know.  Just did never--couldn't get 'em published.  People wouldn't buy 'em.  They, they bought Negro spirituals.  At the turn of the century they were, they was like you know, modern music.  Everybody was buying it.  After the Jubilee Singers went to Europe and sang, it became the order of the day to, to have this music in your collection.
Story_ID: 110518
Speaker 1: So after your graduation from Fisk [University, Nashville, Tennessee], what, where did that lead you in your life after graduation from Fisk?
Speaker 2: I came back to Chicago [Illinois] and I thought that I was gonna become a concert singer at a certain point, you know in my life.  I thought that I was gonna be--in fact after I left out one important story.  I had--in 1958 I was in Mr. [John] Work [III]'s office.  He got a phone call and asked me what I was doing this summer.  I said I'm probably go back to Chicago and work on the railroad.  He said would you like to go to New York and sing at Radio City?  Of course, you know, of course.  And he'd gotten a call from the head of the department at Tuskegee [Institute, now Tuskegee University in Tuskegee, Alabama] where [William L.] Dawson was--he wasn't there.  He was not teaching there, he was retired at that time, to go to New York with the Tuskegee Institute Choir and to sing in Radio City Music Hall for the 25th anniversary of the opening of Radio City Music Hall.  And I of course jumped at that opportunity.  Flew down to Tuskegee, first airplane ride in the states.  Flew to Tuskegee and rode a bus up to New York with the Institute Choir and sang at Radio City for a month.  I did 'Old Man River,' sang 'Old Man River' as a special thing with the Rockettes and all, the whole nine yards.
Story_ID: 110519
Speaker 1: Okay. Earlier you mentioned that these four categories, the anthems, the gospels, the spiritual and psalms.
Speaker 2: And hymns.
Speaker 1: Hymns.  So you gave us a demonstration of the spirituals that was a part of, of the--this Jubilee [Singers] repertoire.  Now how would one compare what a spiritual is to an anthem?
Speaker 2: Well the anthem's more, are more structured.  They, they, they were again, composed, thoroughly composed.  And their origin is European in terms of, you know, the original, I'm talking about the original anthems.  We had one by Steiner and Mozart and Beethoven anthems.  And the music is more--well basically you have an organ or a piano plays an introduction and the choir sings along with it, four-part harmony, three-part harmony.  The Negro spiritual, while it's again made up of a person who happen to feel a certain kind of way in a certain environment, singing trying to soothe the soul with that, in that environment.  And people joining in singing, and a lot of it was not you know, structured.  People didn't pen in a tenor or a alto part.  Just the people had a certain kind of voice type, they started singing, you know.  If I was a bass, I'd sing a lower line than, than the solo the person who's singing the melody.  Some--my mother [Sarah Breckenridge O'Banion] was good for harmonizing, you know harmonizing and improvising on, on melodies, you know that kind of thing.  Same thing that Mahalia Jackson did.  So then you have the, the gospel tunes.  They say what's his name, Dorsey, Thomas A. Dorsey was a great composer of a lot of the gospel tunes.  That's a whole different history now.  But like my mother would sing 'Does Jesus Care?,' you know and that's--does Jesus care when I'm oppressed?  I know my Jesus sees and cares.  (Singing)  That's with accompaniment, you know that, that's the Negro spiritual didn't have accompaniment.  You have piano player playing behind that and maybe a little swing behind it too, just like in jazz.  So that--those are the different kinds of music you have in the church at that time, particular time.
Speaker 1: So Negro spirit--spirituals were just basically just voices only without no accompaniment.
Speaker 2: Voices basically, yeah.
Speaker 1: Without drums or guitars or electric instruments.
Speaker 2: Right, right, right, right.
Story_ID: 110520
Speaker 1: And so when you had the occasion to sing with your--with the, the Fisk Jubilee Singers, spirituals and hymns were sung without gospels, or what was the basic repertoire?
Speaker 2: No, we sang, we sang basically hymns, not hymns, spirituals.  And we would sing some madrigals, European madrigals and art songs.  You know some of the art songs might be composed by John Work [III] himself who was a great composer of art songs too.  That's a whole different ballgame.  Those are songs that, you know were put to music of a poet--the words of a poet, you write music to that and become an art song.
Speaker 1: Could you give me an example of how an art song would sound?  Like for example one of William Dawson's.
Speaker 2: Well I sang one of John Work's art songs, 'My Heart's in the Swampland.'  It was a song that had a nice fluid accompaniment by the piano and the words were from one of the Fisk professors down there at Fisk University [Nashville, Tennessee].  I'm trying to think of his name off the top of my head, wow, boy.  Leslie Collins wrote the words to the song and Mr. Work put the music to it.  My heart's in the swampland at the foot of a Cyprus tree where sweet are the jasmine and the sound of a whispering wind.  (Singing)  And now behind that is this big, beautiful piano, harps being played.  So that's the difference.
Speaker 1: So now if you were to sing a spiritual with--all the spirituals up-tempo the way that you sang that last one, or--
Speaker 2: No.  You have songs that's deep river, slow and three categories of spirituals.  There's the, the ones that are fast, that have up-tempo rhythms.  There's the slow, melodic spiritual, and then there's a call and response chant form.  The call and response chant form is a form of music where you have a solo or solo section singing one part, and being answered by the chorus, you know.  And that was basically what happened in the South.
Speaker 1: So the spirituals were based upon a, a human emotion whereas the art songs were--there's a difference between the intent and the, the style of the lyrics within those two?
Speaker 2: Yeah, the lyrics, the lyrics were basically, you know, poetic, that kind of thing and music written to, to accompany the lyrics.  That's basically the difference between that and the spirituals.  Spirituals are solely from the souls of the people.
Speaker 1: Such as 'Old Man Rivers' you mentioned.  Could you sing us that?
Speaker 2: That's not a spiritual.  That's more--you have to classify that as--I don't know if, if you classify it as an art song.  It's a part of Jerome Kern's 'Show Boat,' so it's a musical, it's extracted from a musical theme.  You want me to sing it?
Speaker 1: No--in other words what you're saying now--in other words, what you're saying is that spirituals has a deeper, religious meaning, whereas the melodies could be the same as art songs, the melodic interpretation.
Speaker 2: No.  Completely--two different--melodies of art songs are something that may--it could be, art song could be a religious song.  But the spirituals are borne out of the souls of the people, you know.  The, the art song or the anthems are written--they're written music where maybe somebody's soul, but not out of the souls of the people.  Something that was made up because of some struggle, much like blues, much like blues.  The old blues, not new blues.  New blues--people are writing new blues now.  But the old blues came out of the souls of sufferings of the people.  You know out of joys or hardships, whatever it was, they would sing about it and that's where it came from.
Story_ID: 110521
Speaker 1: So after you left from Fisk [University, Nashville, Tennessee] to come to Chicago [Illinois], what were some of the--your responsibilities in terms of writing?  What were you inspired to--give us a little information on that--your coming from Fisk to Chicago after you graduated.
Speaker 2: Well the first thing I had to do was to find a job, you know.  And coming from Fisk, from Nashville, was not a--automatically the Board of Education would not certify teachers, black teachers coming up from the South.  They would always send 'em all back to school, you know, to get some more credits here, you got missing credits there.  They did the same, essentially the same thing with me.  And it was in my--in the last eleventh hour that I got certified to substitute teach, not to, not as a certified teacher, but as a substitute teacher in 1959.  In fact it was the day after Labor Day that I was finally cleared.  Normally that's the first day of school.  And from that point on it was just hard work.  Got married [Bonita O'Banion] you know, had--got some kids, you know had, had to support yourself.  So that's basically it.  And after four years at Beidler [Elementary School] where I taught EMH [educable mentally handicap], mentally retarded, supposedly mentally retarded kids.  I went to Marshall [High School] teaching music.  And been at Marshall from that point on, 1963 to 19--to 2005.
Speaker 1: Let's talk a bit about that and how you--what your responsibilities were there at Marshall while you were teaching there beginning of 1963.
Speaker 2: Well I came to Marshall, I was teaching, I'd just come back from South America.  So I got to Marshall.  The John Work Chorale was hired by Alvin Ailey Dance Theater to go to South America, to Brazil to sing and accompany his work, his great work, 'Revelations.'  He wanted to try it with a live chorus.  And so the John Work Chorale went, went to, went to Brazil, went to Sao Paolo and Rio de Janeiro for about two weeks.  When I got back, I had to--before I left I had to resign from the Board of Education.  And when I got back, they asked me what I wanted to do.  I said I wanted to teach music, didn't like being in the classroom teaching EMH [educable mentally handicap] kids anymore.  And so they made a place for me at Marshall High School [Chicago, Illinois] to teach boys chorus.  And I went there to teach boys chorus in October of 1963.  And I went--now that's a whole--that's a whole 'nother part of my life.  Boys chorus, then I became the human relations coordinator when they opened that up in 1966.  I was director of the Theater-in-the-Streets.  I was the first, the founding director of Theater-in-the-Streets when they opened in 1967.
Story_ID: 110522
Speaker 1: Let's talk about--a little bit about the, the John Work Chorus [sic, John Work Chorale].  What type of--you were the only composer--you were the only person that--
Speaker 2: Conductor.
Speaker 1: Conductor that, that group.
Speaker 2: Yes, founder and conductor.
Speaker 1: Was it based on the same exact model that the Fisk Jubilee Singers were?
Speaker 2: Exactly.  What happened was in 1960, Fisk [University, Nashville, Tennessee], the Alumni Association, had a convention here in Chicago [Illinois].  And I'd just graduated from Fisk.  So they asked me to--they knew about, you know, the Jubilee Singers.  They said why don't you get a group together and sing for our Sunday morning service we're gonna have here.  And so I called some people and we got a group of people together, former Jubilee Singers and former choir members, and we sang for that service.  And we were so in love with the sound that we had--sounded like Jubilee Singers, we decided to stick together.  And from 19--that was in September, October of 1960.  From that point to 1961, March of 1961, we had no name.  Theodore Stone asked--wanted to find out whether or not we could--I could put a group together to sing for the National Association for Negro Musicians [NANM], who were meeting in March or April of that year.
Speaker 1: Here in Chicago?
Speaker 2: And of course I had to--here in Chicago.  So I had this group already together, so we just went ahead and decided we would sing for them.  And we had to have a name.  I called Mr. Work, I wrote Mr. Work and asked him could we use his name.  And he wrote me back a beautiful letter telling me he would be very pleased, flattered to be able to use his name.  And so in 19--in March of 1961, we took the name of John Work Chorale.  Have been that since then.
Speaker 1: And this opportunity came based upon a group of alumni from Fisk meeting together and singing at this particular event, and then carrying that on as--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: As a standard for Hartzell [Memorial United Methodist Church].
Speaker 2: Yeah, right.
Speaker 1: How often would you meet as the John Work Chorale?
Speaker 2: We'd meet, we'd meet once a week, once a week for about two, two and a half hours, two, two hours, two and a half hours.
Speaker 1: And to this day everything is still based on a Fisk graduate, or that's how it started out, but now--
Speaker 2: No, it started out then.  But we have--I think we now have perhaps two Fisk, Fisk alumni in the group.  The rest are Chicago people who joined the group because they like to hear--they wanted to sing with us, liked the sound and this kind of thing.  So basically we're basically now a Chicago group, using still the name of John Work Chorale.  And form of Fisk Jubilee Singers.
Story_ID: 110523
Speaker 1: I'm still attempting to figure out those four different forms.  You explained that the spiritual was unaccompanied, and that it was a song that was a capella, without any type of musical accompaniment.
Speaker 2: Right, instrumental accompaniment, right.
Speaker 1: So if you would, you would gave that demon--you gave a demonstration of a spiritual.  How would you give a demonstration of--how does the hymnal differ from a spiritual?  Because sometimes you can sing a hymnal unaccompanied.
Speaker 2: Well most hymns are, you know in the Methodist church you have a hymn book.  So that book has all the hymns in it and they're all accompanied.  You can sing them without accompaniment, but most people use--if they got a pianist, they'll have a piano playing, accompanying the hymns.  Trying to think of anyone of them--let's see.  Well, (starts singing) no that's a, that's a gospel.  'What a Fellowship' is a gospel.
Speaker 1: It's a gospel, let's see how the gospel sounds.
Speaker 2: (Singing) 'What a fellowship, what a joy divine, leaning on the everlasting Lord.  What a blessedness, what a peace is mine, leaning on the everlasting Lord.  Leaning on Jesus, leaning on Jesus, safe and secure,' etc.  That's a, that's a gospel number.  I think I did another gospel for you too.  But--(Singing) 'My faith looks up to thee.  Thou lamb of Calvary.  Savior divine.  Now hear me while I pray, take all my guilt away.  Oh let me from this day behold thee thine.'  Then there's three or four more versus of that.  That's a hymn.  Then the anthems are--trying to think of one that I could sing easily, well 'Hallelujah Chorus.'  (Singing) 'Hallelujah, hallelujah,' everybody knows that.  That's the anthem.  So I've given you the four pieces of music.  Church music, okay.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 110524
Speaker 1: Okay, and during the time that you mentioned that being young and just recently a college graduate and they called you to come up to New York to Radio City [Music Hall] with the I think--
Speaker 2: It was my senior year, I wasn't a college graduate.
Speaker 1: Senior year.
Speaker 2: Yeah senior year, right.
Speaker 1: And you flew down to Florida [sic, Alabama] with the Tuskegee group [Tuskegee Institute Choir] and then came back to New York.  In, in comparison, how do you, you recognize the fact that growing up, these experiences--music is what took you and John [Work III], I'm sorry, and William [L.] Dawson being there [at Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee] your senior year, allowed you this type of exposure that you probably would not have had in any other, other way.  Do you think that because-what in your life, you think, allowed this to happen?
Speaker 2: I, I would say this.  That my mother [Sarah Breckenridge O'Banion] and my ancestors prayed a lot.  I'm the first one in my family to go to college.  But no way in the world I could have gone to anybody's college, graduated from Phillips High School [Chicago, Illinois] with a C-average--it's a long story about that, but I won't go into that.  But a C-average to get into--to get to Fisk [University, Nashville, Tennessee].  They really kind of like I guess recognized my talent and dropped their, dropped their, their requirements to bring me in.  They had faith in what I could do.  But that's, that's a blessing from God, you know.  All of this has been.  I've been in the right place at the right time.  I was--like I said before when I was talking about being in the office and Mr. Work when Tuskegee--(unclear) from Tuskegee called him and asked him about somebody to sing, sing 'Old Man River' to go to Tuske--go with them to, to New York.  I'd been standing there when it happened.  When they came--when the Jubilee Singers came to Chicago to sing that concert, and it was and my--probably been about 1953, '54 [1954], I was still in high school.  And the night--it so happened the weekend they came, we had our choir concert.  I mean it could have been some--I mean I--they probably wouldn't have heard me had our concert been another weekend.  But it just happened that those two things happened at the same time.  And so after they heard me, the group took me down to see Mr. Work and he offered me the scholarship.  So everything in my life has happened like that.  You know we talk about--I told you about the trip to, to South America with Alvin Ailey.  It was 1963, we were having the centennial celebration for the Emancipation Proclamation at the old McCormick Place.  I had been trying to get my group in to sing, do a concert there.  Duke Ellington was in town.  He was doing this 'Black, Beige and Brown' [sic, 'Black, Brown and Beige] cycle at, at McCormick Place, that was a big thing.  My choir didn't--the John Work Chorale was not selected to sing along with him, you know.  There was another choir that, that got together, larger choir, and he selected that group to sing with the 'Black, Beige and Brown' concert he was doing.  And so we were--I mean struggle to get--to do a concert in a little theater there in old McCormick Place.  I don't know if you're familiar with that place.  They had a real huge stage, the Arie Crown [Theater], and then they had a little, couple of little small theaters.  And we happened to do a--get a concert to do in the small theater.  And Alvin Ailey was dancing with Duke Ellington in 'Black, Beige and Brown.'  And he was--had a trip to, to go to South America, and he was looking for a group to sing with him.  Well the group that was with him was the ideal group.  The group was already singing.  But he didn't want that group, he wanted a smaller group, a more flexible group.  And so he came to our concert and selected us.
Story_ID: 112107
Speaker 1: Let's talk more about the, the corroboration [sic, collaboration] with the Duke Ellington, Alex, I'm sorry.  The Alvin Ailey meeting here in Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 2: Well like I said before, Duke Ellington had been scheduled to come to Chicago to do--to produce his 'Black, Beige and Brown' [sic, Black, Brown and Beige]--it's called 'My People' when he produced it here.
Speaker 1: And what was that in particular?
Speaker 2: It was a song, it was a--concert songs that he wrote back in the early '50s [1950s] I think he wrote it.  Mahalia Jackson sang one of the songs, but they put it into production, early production thing where they had dancers and, and soloists and choir, the whole thing.  And we had been--the John Work Choral had at that time it kind of almost, kind of like almost fell apart.  People had dropped out and I was--had a skeleton crew of a choral trying to get together to do a concert, trying to get, get the concert done at the same time during the same period of time.  And we, we did--we were able to do that.  And when Alvin Ailey came, contacted me about perhaps auditioning to go with his group to, to Brazil--
Speaker 1: So take me back a minute.  Duke Ellington was here in town and then Alvin Ailey was along with-
Speaker 2: Also, he was in the program.  He was in 'My People.'
Speaker 1: Of Duke Ellington's.
Speaker 2: With Duke Ellington.  He was dancing in, in the production.
Speaker 1: And he was very young at this time, this is prior to his becoming--
Speaker 2: He was, you know young, in his thirties probably, late twenties, early thirties.
Speaker 1: And this is before the Alvin Ailey Dancers.
Speaker 2: No, this is the Alvin Ailey Dancers, this is his--
Speaker 1: Himself, he had his group.
Speaker 2: This is the American Dance, Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater I think it's called at that time.  And so he came to our concert, we gave one concert Sunday afternoon in a little theater and he came to the concert.  And we talked.  And his manager called me and asked me what we, what we--how could we do it.  Could we get everybody all in on the program.  And so I called people and I could only take eight out of the twelve or thirteen that I had.  And so I selected those eight and we went to, we went to South America with him.  Sang a concert, two or three concerts in Braz--in Rio de Janeiro, and went to Sao Paolo and did two or three.
Speaker 1: And what was that like?  While you were singing.
Speaker 2: It was absolutely fantastic.  We--the first concert in, in Rio de Janeiro, again, when we sang our portion of the concert, the first concert he gave us a portion to sing.  And so we sang our first section.  It was a, a standing ovation.  The audience just went up, Brazilians just went up for grabs.  We sang about four songs.  And they almost didn't stop applauding.  And I think that that created a, kind of a problem because they were really the stars and we were just on their program.  And after that, they--we, we--our pro--our part of the program was cut.  But we did, we did sing with the dancers a couple of times.  The problem there is that see they had been used to dancing to a tape.  And the tape--timing on the tape is like after, after one number there's five beats before you get to the next number, and their bodies were tuned to jump in from one number to the next with the, with the beats in between.  And when you got a group singing live, you may miss a beat, you know.  You gotta give 'em a pitch, gotta start 'em off.  They may--the tempos may be even different.  So that was one of the problems we had with that.  But we did--we enjoyed it.  We were down there for two weeks, got paid, everybody got paid, and came back to Chicago.
Story_ID: 112108
Speaker 1: And so this is during the time when--these were new experiments, obviously.  A choral along with Alvin Ailey dancers and the Duke Ellington having the Alvin Ailey dance with.  All these experimental music forms that was going on with the combination of dance and music at this particular period, or how would you relate?
Speaker 2: Well I don't know if it was experimental.  When we came back from South America, we did do something like that.  We--by that time my eyes were opened.  I came back, I hired some dancers.  We had a drummer.  We went to Dunbar High School to--hired the auditorium and put on a production where we featured dancers and drums.  And the choral [John Work Chorale], and the choir, and choral itself.  Very, very, very, very powerful program.
Speaker 1: What, what type of music did you have then?
Speaker 2: We did Negro spirituals.
Speaker 1: The dancing and, and drum?
Speaker 2: Dancing and drums.  We had one work by--there was the 'Prodigal Son,' we did that work.  We did another work about the history of Negro spirituals.  So we did several things.  Our announcer at that time was one guy called Vince Sanders.  Vince Sanders went on to New York, worked for NBC, and was a close friend of the guy who just passed, the newscaster that just passed.  So he's still alive too.
Speaker 1: So tell me more about this--your group [John Work Chorale].  When you, when you returned and you spoke with John Work [III] who was your choir director at Fisk [University, Nashville, Tennessee], as a way of, of naming this newly formed group, you used John Work's name as the John Work Chorale.  And in the beginning, it was all Fisk University students, and then eventually--
Speaker 2: Well basically most of them were former Fisk--although the first group was all Fisk University students.  And after you know, after we sang that concert that one Sunday morning, then we, you know, kind of stayed together, rehearsed, rehearsed a bit together for about, you know, next three or four months and took in a couple new people that didn't go to Fisk, you know.  And we've done that all along.  And now it's to the point where we really--myself and one, one other member are the only two members that are former Fiskites.
Story_ID: 112109
Speaker 1: And did you also have a church choir here in Chicago [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I'm the conductor or music director, or what you call that, they call minister of music at Hartzell [Memorial] United Methodist Church, same church I grew up in.  I'm presently minister of music there.  And we do all kinds of music.  In fact, a couple of Sundays from now we'll be doing Handel's 'Messiah,' the entire 'Messiah' with orchestra.  You might want to come to visit with us there, December 17th at the church, 33rd and King Drive.
Speaker 1: I will definitely.  Well then your legendary--your being there, the same church that you grew up in, and now as the musical director, are you also involved in--you perform--you're just directing, or are you also the pianist or what?
Speaker 2: No, I don't play any instrument like that.  I have a pianist, a piano player and we have--come 'Messiah,' we'll have an orchestra.  Piano player and an organist--pianist and an organist we normally use.  I just train the choir.  A very good choir, too, by the way.
Speaker 1: And what age groups and what, what type of composition?
Speaker 2: Well today the composition of a, of a senior choir at most churches in Chicago including mine, is--we're all above--in the age group of between forty and a hundred, you know.  It's very difficult, very difficult to get kids, young kids to sing the music of the, of the church today.  They're all into this inspirational gospel type, you know, drums and bass and guitar playing and stomping and clapping their hands and that kind of thing.  We do a little bit of that too, but not as much as the young people want to hear.
Story_ID: 112110
Speaker 1: And then tell me about your experiences at Marshall High School in Chicago [Illinois] after you returned and, and was assigned the--at Marshall High School here in Chicago.
Speaker 2: Well I started out, like I said before, they called, they made a position for me to sing, I mean to, to direct the boy's chorus, to formally direct the boy's chorus.  Which by the way within a year, it took the first superior rating of a black conductor at the school.  I don't know what the other conductors who had been white had done, but we were the first to take a superior in a city-wide competition.  After that I continued to conduct the boys chorus.  We produced shows, sang in concerts and festivals and sang around the, around the city.  And I formulated a group, again a, a third group called the Marshall Madrigals which were formulated, were patterned after the Fisk Jubilee Singers.  And this group of high school kids, we went around from different schools in the city, different places, singing songs, Negro spirituals as, such as the, as the Jubilee Singers did and such as the John Work Chorale was doing.  After that I--a job came available to be a human relations coordinator.  I applied for it and got the job.  And from 1966 through 1970, I was human relations coordinator and also conducted in my spare time, the Marshall Madrigals, which still went around and, and sang at various locations.
Story_ID: 112111
Speaker 1: During that period of time, 1970--'67 [1967], '68 [1968], '69 [1969], the school wrote a proposal for street theater.  And it was the summer of '67 [1967] was a very hot, long hot summer that people didn't want to be on the West Side or the South Side.  And I wound up being the conductor, not the conductor, the director of that program [Theater-In-The-Streets], which was the first successful theater in the streets program in the, in the country.  And out of that program we--for the next three years, the program thrived.  They had a street theater program that, that came out of that in Chicago.  It was a white program that came out of that in Chicago.  But we were--we performed at the Daley Plaza, we performed in the streets all over the city's West Side and the South Side and some places on the North Side.
Speaker 2: And so this street theater was more of, of drama and music, or how--
Speaker 1: It was, it was everything.  It was, it was revue of whatever was happening--kind of music we did.  We did the first revue of 'Hair' in Chicago.  We also performed--that was the second year in 1968.  In '67 [1967] we did the, the 'Fiddler on the Roof' in the streets.  We did excerpts from 'Fiddler on the Roof.'  So we did just about all kinds of music.  Sang gospel music.  We sang 'O Happy Day' and 'Amen' in the streets.  We had a band, we had an orchestra.
Speaker 2: Really.
Speaker 1: So we went around and toured the, toured the city all the time doing that.
Speaker 2: And this was both males and females.
Speaker 1: These are kids.
Speaker 2: Right, exactly.
Speaker 1: These are kids.
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: High school kids.
Story_ID: 112112
Speaker 1: Now, 1970 I was blessed to get a scholarship to, to, to University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois], and I went to the University of Chicago for two years on a fellowship from the National Institute of Mental Health [NIMH] to be a social psychologist.  And was there, while I was there, music was just floating through my head all the time.  I was going to classes and music was just--that's all I could do.  I went to Nashville [Tennessee] and had to run out of the room to record tunes that were running through my head.  And when I finished the two years at University of Chicago, I decided I, I'd rather go back to school, go back to Marshall [High School, Chicago, Illinois], and I did that, went back to Marshall.  And at that point I was there for a year doing general music and then I toured with a band in 1974.
Speaker 2: At that time when you left Marshall to go to the University of Chicago, no one took your place at that point?  It was just--
Speaker 1: Well they always had somebody there, you know, but they was not taking my place because I was actually the human relations coordinator and that program ended in 1970.  So I went to University of Chicago, that was at the end of that program.  When I, when I came back, I came back as a general music teacher.  Did that for a year and a half and then took over the, the chorus, Marshall's chorus, mixed chorus.  And the following summer, 1974, I took over the band and directed the band from 1974 until 19--let's see, 1980, eighty, '85 [1985] or something like that.
Speaker 2: And this band, when you say you directed the band at Marshall High School, jazz band or--
Speaker 1: It was a band.  It was everything, it was jazz band, marching band.
Speaker 2: What you were saying, same as the--
Speaker 1: As any high school here in Chicago.  They have jazz band, marching band, concert band, beginner's band, intermediate band, the whole nine yards, all there in one package.  And took that band--we, we took a couple of superior ratings also.
Speaker 2: And during this time, what was happening with the street, the street theater that you had--
Speaker 1: That had end--that ended in 1970 also.  It was a pilot program and when it ended, then the, the Illinois Council gave some money to this company that started street theater.  Ours was Theater-In-The-Streets.  The other company was called Street Theater.  And there was a long article--a lot of articles about that while that happened.
Story_ID: 112113
Speaker 1: All right, okay. Now when we were speaking of the, the theater, the street theater that you had, and then right afterwards you left to go to the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois].  Now--and this was a pilot program.
Speaker 2: Theater-in-the-Streets was a pilot program, yes.
Speaker 1: Were some of the same, some of the same students or children that you had in that street theater, did some of them come also from the, the Marshall High School [Chicago, Illinois] experience, or was this a combination of different sets of children in Chicago [Illinois], or--
Speaker 2: Well we, we took kids in from all over the city.  The kids--it was a summer program, and we somehow there was able to pay the kids a stipend from the theater, not from the theater program, but it--at that time it was--what do you call--NYC, summer jobs with kids.  And we were able to arrange with a couple of our friends who worked for the city to get X amount of jobs from the city, although we--they called them streets, we were supposed to be cleaning the streets and doing other kinds of things, but we were actually the first group of kids to be paid to perform in the city.  High school kids being performed--now that's just the order of the day.  They got a whole bunch of programs around like that today.  But at the time the program was going on, I was predicting that we were gonna lose the program because I figured that the white folks are gonna take it ultimately, and they did, they did.  They gave the money to, to this guy and they, they started 'Street Theater.'And the schools that founded it were cut out completely.  I was completely cut out of the program.  But it was a successful program.
Speaker 1: And what year are we speaking of now?
Speaker 2: We're talking about 1970, 19--when it ended, 1970, that point on, yeah.
Story_ID: 112114
Speaker 1: And then after this experience, there is--they mentioned that you were the legendary Marshall High.  What, what is--what was the--did you--
Speaker 2: Legend.
Speaker 1: Yeah, the legendary.
Speaker 2: Well I was there for forty, forty-one and a half years, and I did many, many things.  I did--started out with the boys chorus, did human relations coordinator when they had the sum--the long hot summers of, of the '60s [1960s] when--after [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther] King [Jr.] got killed and burning down.  Marshall [High School, Chicago, Illinois] didn't have any riots during that period of time.  The only riot they had was the day after King got killed; wasn't at the school, it was all up and down Madison Street.  Many of our student probably participated in it, but never documented that they did.  But Marshall during, during my reign there when schools were being turned out left and right, Marshall was, had class all--every day, you know.  I was human relations coord--I was the person--the liaison between the community and the kids and, and the school.  And then my boys--when I ultimately came back in seventy, '72 ([972], and had a band, my band was--jazz band played all over the city, the jazz band played at every major hotel in downtown Chicago.  The concert band marched in almost every parade in Chicago.  And the concert band of course took superior ratings, excellent and superior ratings in the city.  And having taught for forty-one years, you know I've seen generations.  I taught some parents of my kids of course, and maybe even some grandparents.  So my reputation at Marshall High School is pretty, pretty solid.  Very, very solid.
Speaker 1: That same time you were also the musical director at, at the church that you are--
Speaker 2: Well I started that in about 1975, or '76 [1976].  That's when I started and become, became the musical director at Hartzell [Memorial United Methodist Church].  But I still had the John Work Chorale, you know, during that, throughout the whole time.
Speaker 1: Speaking of Marshall High School [Chicago, Illinois], what are one of the most prominent--what one of the most prominent events that you remember out of your forty-one years' experience that, that came out of your being at John Marshall?
Speaker 2: I would say the band, the band experience.  That was probably my most rewarding.  Because when I left Phillips High School [Chicago, Illinois], I wanted to be a band director.  Going to Fisk [University, Nashville, Tennessee], they had no band program, okay.  So I changed to major, music major, singing, singing music, vocal major.  And in 1973, '74 [1974], Marshall's band director was suddenly transferred to another school.  And I happened to have a summer program that summer and I was in the principal's office and said well you know I don't know what I'm gonna do.  My band, don't even have a band director.  Supposed to be going to, to Grambling [State University, Grambling, Louisiana] and having a workshop down at Grambling and they're supposed to go.  And I said well I, I'll step in for you if you want me to, 'cause we were good friends by that time.  And so I went to Grambling with the band and when I came back to Chicago, were no, nobody wanted to be bothered with the band.  The band was pretty, pretty, pretty bad, you know.
Speaker 1: And Grambling has a great marching band tradition.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was one of the workshops.  One of those things we went down to Grambling, supposedly, but my kids, kids from Marshall, they weren't my kids.  They couldn't, they couldn't play, they couldn't participate in the program because they were completely, totally disciplined-wise--they lacked discipline.  But when I got back to Marshall I agreed to take over the program till they found somebody to take the program, to get a band director 'cause I hadn't had the band experience since high school.  And so I used all that experience that [Earl] Madison had taught me, that I learned in high school.  I began the program in 1974 at Marshall High School.  And from 1974, fifteen years, '74 [1974], '75 [1975] to 1990, I directed the band and took the band from about twenty kids to a program that had about 150 kids in it.  And Marshall again, I said we had a jazz band, marching band, concert band, and beginner's band program.
Speaker 1: Very rich music.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so that was probably my richest experience.  Plus when we take the superior ratings, we played in these various competitions.  To be able to stand in front of a band of kids and play music, the same music that the Chicago Symphony Orchestra played.  They played one year the 'Pictures at an Exhibition,' and the finale for the 'New World Symphony.'  Note per note, the same notes that the Chicago Symphony Orchestra played.  These little black kids played every note and got a superior rating.  So I mean that's, that's what I call rewarding.
Speaker 1: Some of these kids of course, some of them went later into music as careers?
Speaker 2: We have kids all over the country right now.
Speaker 1: I would imagine.
Speaker 2: From Marshall High School under my direction, under my tutelage.  We have kids that are in, in the theater and in acting.  And they all came from Marshall High School (unclear).  We had a, we've had a good, a good success with kids.
Speaker 1: And you--up to Marshall, up until 2000 was when you were--
Speaker 2: Two-thousand five [2005].
Speaker 1: Two-thousand five [2005] you retired from Marshall.
Story_ID: 112115
Speaker 1: And from that point on you've only--you've been the directing all of your focus on the John Work Chorale.
Speaker 2: And the Hartzell Choir [at Hartzell Memorial United Methodist Church].
Speaker 1: And the Hartzell Choir.
Speaker 2: And in the, and not, you know, not all my focus.  I'm, I'm retired.  So I don't do too much of anything, you know.  I rehearse every week with each group.  And we do concerts around the city, you know.
Speaker 1: Well how do you feel about the way you've lived your life and what is important to you?
Speaker 2: Well as I said before, I've been extremely blessed to have come from my background, from the background where I came from.  My mother [Sarah Breckenridge O'Banion] did two years of high school, my father [Julian O'Banion] didn't finish grammar school.  My mother ultimately went, went on and became a nurse after she left Chicago [Illinois], after many years of being a maid.  She retired and went to Florida and went to school and became a nurse.  My father retired from International Harvester and he was, you know, quite a, quite a mechanic by the time he, he retired.  He was a troubleshooter for International Harvester over here at 26th, what's that, California.  Wherever that--26th and Western.  He often told me about stories about how in Boston [Illinois] all the guys went to these, went to these, went to this vocational school to become carpenters and things like that and wound up as waiters and bus boys and he was the only one that didn't go to school, he wound up doing what they were supposed to be doing.  That was it.
Speaker 1: Amazing.
Story_ID: 112116
Speaker 1: Well tell me how--for those that are going into music or any other--in the arts or theaters, what's the suggestion would you have for someone today that's building a career in music or dance or some of the theater, theatrical underpinnings that you have involved your students with at Marshall throughout these forty-one years?  What, what suggestions would you have for someone that's coming up?
Speaker 2: The suggestion I would have for anybody would be go to school.  That's, that's all it is, just about going to school.  I wish my, my, my only regret was when I was going to school, I did not take it as seriously as I perhaps should have, grammar school, high school.  But the opportunity was not there for what I'm involved in now, except for the band and the choral teachers in, in grammar school.  So when I went to Fisk [University, Nashville, Tennessee], kids came into Fisk, they knew theory.  They played the piano, they did all kinds of things that I, you know, was unable to do because I didn't have that background.  So my, my recommendation for anybody is whatever field you're gonna be in, get the education, go to school and learn as much as you can.
Story_ID: 112117
Speaker 1: Well what is it that you still want to do that you have not done yet?  Although you are retired, and although you are still directing the, the John Work Chorale and you're the church--director of your church [Hartzell Memorial United Methodist Church].  What is it that you still haven't done that you would like to do?  Is there anything?
Speaker 2: I have hours of compositions that I have recorded.  I'd like to take the time to, some time to sit down, have the time and the resources, sit down and transfer those recordings to written music and publish it.  You know I'd love, love to do that.  I have an archive of, archive of thousands of hours of tape, both audio tape and video tape of historic events.  I think from Marshall High School, musical events--
Speaker 1: Really.
Speaker 2: --that I would love to be able to catalog and make available, you know.  I think--
Speaker 1: And what--excuse me.
Speaker 2: I think that I would like more, more than anything else, would like to be able to finish up my career, my life with doing the composition, musical composition, producing musical composition.
Story_ID: 112118
Speaker 1: And Mr. O'Banion, what are your hopes and concerns for the African American community?
Speaker 2: Well I just hope it gets smarter, that's all.  Really and truly.  I hope we do what, what HistoryMakers is doing; trying to find ways to enlighten, to lift up people, become self-sufficient business-wise and community-wise, stop killing, stop destroying neighborhoods.  You know, become politically astute so that we can move into those positions that are responsible for this kind of blight that's come up on the black community, you know, and remove it.  'Cause you know we really don't own too much of anything.  You know the--I've lived in Lake Meadows [Chicago, Illinois], I lived in Lake Meadows for a good portion of my life.  But before Lake Meadows, I lived right there where Lake Meadows is.  When they sold that property, when they tore down the houses, those houses were not slums.  I lived there, they were not slums.  They were just houses.  You can go on the North Side and see the same houses still standing.  But that neighborhood was destroyed.  The West Side, the same thing.  Destroyed, complete and total destruction of neighborhoods to build houses that fatten people's pockets.  Draper and Kramer, you know, the politicians and the, what do you call it, the realtors are in cahoots.
Story_ID: 112119
Speaker 1: Mr. O'Banion, when you look back on your entire life, what stands out the most?
Speaker 2: The blessings.
Speaker 1: The blessings.
Speaker 2: I wouldn't be sitting here in this chair talking to you right now if it hadn't been for the things that happened to me that were strictly not of my doing.  It's something that happened to be in the right place at the right time and things happened, you know.
Story_ID: 112120
Speaker 1: And how do you want to be remembered?  What do you want people to say about you in the future?
Speaker 2: He's a good man, that's all.
Speaker 1: But it was more than just being a good man, there's many other--
Speaker 2: He was a good man, that's, that's basically it, you know, good person, lived a good life, you know.  Didn't walk on anybody, didn't mistreat anybody.  That's basically it.
Speaker 1: Is there anything else that you would like to add to this interview that we have not dis-discussed?
Speaker 2: No, I can't think of anything else.  I mean I, you know, other than my blessings, that's all.  Nothing else.
Story_ID: 112121
Speaker 1: And what do you want your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: My sons, grandkids.  I was blessed as I said before, to be able to go to college and then to get married and have two wonderful sons, both of whom went to Fisk [University, Nashville, Tennessee], got their degrees.  And the oldest one went on to University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois], got a law degree.  And the youngest one got a master's in science and molecular biology from Fisk.  And they're both in Chicago.  They're raising grandkids and relatively decent life, you know.  Come a long way from where I was.
Speaker 1: Remarkable, remarkable.  Well thank you so very much for this interview and for your gracious time that you've spent with us today.
Speaker 2: Well I thank you.  It's been, been a blast.
Speaker 1: And thank you for leading the life that you've led and the contributions that you've made in African American society.
Speaker 2: Okay, very good.  Thank you very much.

Speaker 1: My name is Julieanna Richardson and I'm the interviewer and today Terry Stegner is the videographer and Charlie Charmarco [ph.] was helping also, the lighting person.  And I'd like to have you--we're gonna start off by slating it.  And I'd like to have you start out by stating your name and spelling it for us.
Speaker 2: Name is Delano O'Banion.  The spelling is D-E-L-A-N-O, O'B-A-N-I-O-N.
Speaker 1: And I want to have you also state your, your date of birth.
Speaker 2: November 3rd, 1936.
Speaker 1: Okay, and also I want to have you state the location.
Speaker 2: Location is the Channel 7 studios in Chicago, Illinois.
Speaker 1: Thanks to Emily Barr who's made this studio available for us.  And your occupation.
Speaker 2: I'm retired schoolteacher.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Last time, you know when--this is a continuation of an interview that you did previously, so it's themed on really to supplement the interview that was done.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 113610
Speaker 1: And I remember you saying on the, you know, that one of your, your favorite color was red.  And you know you talked about your family background and growing up, and even how you came--your name came to be.  That your first name is, is Delano, Franklin Delano Roosevelt.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Which I thought was--let me ask you about that, though.  Was your--did your mother [Sarah Breckenridge O'Banion] ever explain that more about your name and, and how it came or why, why--
Speaker 2: Well she told me that the--stated--my father [Julian O'Banion] and mother told me both that I was named as far--I don't know how long, five or six days or something and Roosevelt got elected and my godmother who they--with whom they lived, came up with the name Delano.
Speaker 1: The other thing that I don't think was touched upon as much was your siblings.  Can you give their name and birth order?
Speaker 2: Well my oldest brother was Julian Clifford O'Banion, Jr., and he was born in 1929.  My next brother was Lincoln Levi O'Banion, he was born two years after my oldest brother.  And I was born in 1936, and my youngest brother was born in 1938.  My--I was born in '36 [1936], my youngest brother Bertrand O'Banion was born in 1938.
Speaker 1: So two named after presidents, Lincoln.
Speaker 2: Lincoln, Lincoln Levi, Lincoln Levi O'Banion, yes right, right.
Story_ID: 113611
Speaker 1: Now the other thing that I want to touch upon.  You had the--one, one of your brothers died.  Which one was that?
Speaker 2: Lincoln Levi[O'Banion].
Speaker 1: Okay.  And you said in the interview that that had had a devastating effect on--or it changed the family.  You know and I was wondering could you elaborate on that?
Speaker 2: Well my memory from the years that I was born up until that point we were, you know, a family.  My father [Julian O'Banion] and mother [Sarah Breckenridge O'Banion] and my brothers, four brothers.  And at that point my oldest brother [Julian O'Banion, Jr.] was in high school I think.  He had started high school at Philips [High School, Chicago, Illinois], which he was not able to adjust to.  He was twelve years old in high school.  Very, very bright kid.  And he had gone away to Kentucky to go to school with his grandparents, live with his grandparents to go to school there.  And then Lincoln died, and my mother was very sick at the time.  I think she was pregnant at the time he died, she lost a child.  And the family just kind of like fell apart.  It was no longer the same, you know, four boys.  Kind of like we, we sang harmony, you know we sang all the time in the house and played together.  I was my oldest brother's partner and my younger, younger brother was my second brother's partner.  So things kind of had changed, you know and I don't think it ever came back.  My father left in about 1950, 1951 at that point.
Speaker 1: Okay, so when you say--I know I'm doing exactly what I didn't say I was gonna do--
Speaker 2: Go ahead.
Speaker 1: --Off-camera, but when you say that it changed, can we just take you back to that, that period and can you talk about how it changed?  Now Lincoln, was he the one who was very talented from an art, art's perspective?
Speaker 2: Right, very, very, talented.
Speaker 1: He was the artest.
Speaker 2: He was the artist and the singer.  And he was the one that I--went to the church after he passed and asked the teacher could I sing in honor of him, and that started my singing career.  But he was the one that really was a very, very talented artist.  He was a--at fourteen he was enrolled in the Art Institute of Chicago [in Chicago, Illinois].  Painting, drawing the models, the naked models and stuff, which was fascinating to me, you know.  And I think me and my younger brother both tried to imitate his artwork, you know, we were very skilled at art at the certain point of time when it was interesting to do.  But that's kind of, it kind of tore the family apart.  We never really recovered from that.
Speaker 1: How did he die?
Speaker 2: He had cancer.  So we watched him--first he had, first he was attacked by a gang at Phillips High School and kneed in the groin and they had a--one of his testicles removed.  And then after that, somehow they discovered that he had a tumor and then cancer and then it traveled through his body.  He was one of the first--like I said the first person I ever heard of in terms of cancer.  And he was very fair-complected [sic] and they gave him chemi--chemical treatments or chemotherapy and actually his back was--it was in his whole body.  The back was very, very burned or looked like very, very black because of the chemical treatment.  But he didn't, he didn't survive that.
Speaker 1: That wasn't radiation then?
Speaker 2: Radiation treatment, yeah, radiation, yeah.
Speaker 1: So now when--what year was this that he passed away?
Speaker 2: Nineteen forty-eight [1948], January 8th, 1948.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you were twelve, right? Twelve years old.
Speaker 2: No, I was eleven.
Speaker 1: You were eleven, I'm sorry, okay.
Speaker 2: I'd be twelve in, in November of that year, yeah, right.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  And tell me why you think it tore, it tore the family apart?  I mean just was, was there blame or was it just sorrow?
Speaker 2: It was sorrow.  I think a bit--you, when you have a unit of six people.  We were, you know, a family.  And one of the units are removed and surreptitiously removed, you know, we weren't prepared for that.  Never have felt of, of death, or thought of death.  And he was the favorite, you know son so to speak.  Lot of fun, had a lot of talent.  And just happened, just disappears kind of like a different kind of atmosphere.  My older--plus my oldest brother went to Kentucky to finish school, you know, and that left me and my baby brother.  I think my father might have been laid off.  He worked at International [Harvester]--might have been laid off during that period of time too, my mother had to work.  And--
Speaker 1: And you say your mother was pregnant, or she had just lost a child.
Speaker 2: She had just lost a child, yeah, she lost a child.
Speaker 1: Okay so it was--there was a lot of loss.
Speaker 2: A lot of stuff that was going on, you know.  She was, she was unable to attend the funeral.  In fact they brought the coffin past our house, the apartment and on the--and but she was able to view him on the first floor, neighbor downstairs in the third, three, you know, tenement, allowed her to be put in the living room in her house and she went down and viewed him, you know.
Speaker 1: So you--so you're saying Lincoln was the--was he the oldest, or was he the second?
Speaker 2: Second, second child.
Speaker 1: He was the second.
Speaker 2: Yes, second one.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 113612
Speaker 1: Now tell me--can you describe to me your mother [Sarah Breckenridge O'Banion]?  I know you described her as someone who loved to sing, you know, and that there was a lot of music.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: But can you describe her just a little bit more?  What kind of person she was.
Speaker 2: Well she was a hardworking woman.  You know she didn't have a, but a second high school, second year high school education.  At the time she was basically a maid and a caterer.  She catered to people in, in north, far north side and then the western suburbs.  And she was just a, a churchgoing woman.  Every Sunday she went to church and she sure--initially made sure her boys went to church too.  So we all went to church on Sunday morning with her.  Me and my baby brother, particularly.  We sat beside her while she sang in the gospel choir.
Speaker 1: So this was at Hartzell [Memorial United Methodist Church in Chicago, Illinois]]?
Speaker 2: Hartzell, yes, Hartzell Church you know.  And my oldest brother sang in the, in the, in the youth choir, the young people's choir at Hartzell.  And we--all the young, all the young kids at Hartzell wanted to be--twelve, thirteen years old, they could join the choir too, the youth choir.  And that's what we're--that's our history in terms of the church.  She was very, very much a singer in the church.  She sang gospel music and was highly regarded as a singer in the church.  One of the first stylized, you know you hear Mahalia Jackson stylizing a song or hymn, but my mother did that also.
Speaker 1: Now when you, when you say stylized, can you give me an example of that?
Speaker 2: Well you have a melody that, you know is written out and the person sings that melody, normally as it's written.  And the person who stylizes a song, takes that melody and twists it around and puts a few curlicues in there to make it their song.
Speaker 1: So it's improvisational.
Speaker 2: Improvisational, yes a lot, lot of it is improvisational, yes.

Speaker 1: Now your father [Julian O'Banion], can you describe him?
Speaker 2: My father was a very hardworking man, when he worked.  He worked at International Harvester.  And he had a seventh grade education, but a very, very smart man because at, at International Harvester he became a troubleshooter.  He could listen to an engine, one of those tractor engines or one of those engines they put in the--at the time I think they were putting engines in the, in the tanks also.  He could listen to it and tell what was wrong.  And so he was kind of like a troubleshooter around the plant there at 26th and California I think it was.
Speaker 1: Now what were--was he work--did he work regular hours, did he work any shifts?
Speaker 2: He worked regular hours, very regular hours.  He worked from 7:00 in the morning till maybe 4:00 in the afternoon.
Story_ID: 113614
Speaker 1: Okay, can we talk about family life before your, your, your brother, you know died?  Can you describe the, you know, the street that you lived on and--
Speaker 2: Well 34th and Vernon was a very, very--well it was a, a neighborhood, you know.  We had people across the street--there were no vacant lots on the, on the street, on the block at all, you know.  It's where Lake Meadows [Chicago, Illinois] is presently.  And there was a baby doll building, a big court way building on the corner across from, from 30--in the 3300 block of Vernon.  There were three story tenements all along the block.  There was a variety of incomes.  People--you'd live next door to people who had a lot of money and you didn't have it--but nobody thought about that.  It wasn't like it was a separation of class in terms of that.  Some people had money, some people worked different jobs.  People--the guy who owned the gas station lived down the block from us.  There was a shoemaker that lived around the corner, you know that kind of thing, so you had a neighborhood more than anything else.  We played together, kids in front of the house.  My mother [Sarah Breckenridge O'Banion] would allow her--us to go as little boys, wouldn't allow us to go around the corner out of the sight, sight, sight lines of the apartment we lived in.  So if we played, we played right in front of the house, as far as she could see down to the south, or wouldn't go around the corner.  You know if our ball went across the street, we had to ask somebody to throw it to us.  That's how she ruled us.
Speaker 1: Do you remember what she would say to you, you know, or your parents would say to you?  You know how sometimes parents have words of advice or sayings or things like that.  Do you remember anything that, you know, sticks out?
Speaker 2: Not anything that sticks out.  She was just a, you know, not a disciplinarian 'cause she was not like that, you know, my father [Julian O'Banion] was not like that either, you know.  We got whippings of course, all kids--if you did something really wrong, you'd get a whipping.  But oftentimes my father would--my mother would wait, you know, do the motherly thing.  Say well Delano did such and such and such today, you know and he knew to--he needs to be disciplined or whipped, you know and so my father would take me in the back room and he hit, hit the bed and ask me to act, actually asked me to holler out like I was being whipped, see.  So I had a lot of things that happened to me like that.  I was--I didn't like whippings.  I would not do anything to get a whipping.
Speaker 1: Wait--he would ask you to holler out?   Were you getting a whipping?
Speaker 2: No, pretend like I was getting a whipping, yeah.
Speaker 1: So he wouldn't really hit--
Speaker 2: No, he wouldn't whip, he wouldn't whip me.
Speaker 1: Now why would he do that? That's--
Speaker 2: Well I was supposed to be daddy's boy, you know and he knew I was not, I was not a kid to go ahead and do things like you know, that would be necessarily bad.  So he would kind of give me a break, you know.
Speaker 1: Now why were you daddy's boy?
Speaker 2: I have no idea, I have no idea.  My youngest brother was mama's boy, and my oldest brother--I mean I was daddy's boy--
Story_ID: 113615
Speaker 1: You were talking about your father [Julian O'Banion] and I was asking why were you his favorite.  And you said you didn't know.
Speaker 2: Why he wouldn't spank me.  Because I was his--
Speaker 1: No, but why was he your favorite?  Why do you think?
Speaker 2: I don't know.  I think it was the thing between me and my baby brother.  I looked more like my father and my baby brother looked like his mother, so we fought at the time.  And so that was basically the, the basis of all that.  He was on the chubbier side, I was thin like my father.  And had a lot of his characteristics, which I still do, you know.  But I think that was basically it, you know.
Speaker 1: Tell me, tell me about his characteristics?  What were you--
Speaker 2: He was quiet.  Man of few words.  He--there's a little story I have 'bout him and myself.  He would come home from work and find me awake in the bed, you know, supposed to be taking a nap.  And he'd get me up out of bed and we'd walk, walk me down to 31st Street to the beach, walk me around the neighborhood and things like that.  And one of the things I remember particularly well is that sometimes when he came home from work, he would bring home this apple, he would bring in a apple and I guess as a small kid, that apple looked huge to me.  But that would be something he would bring home for me, you know.  So that would be--that's how we kind of like bonded and the funny thing is that we bonded again in our older age, even though he had separated from my mother [Sarah Breckenridge O'Banion].  At the time I was bitter about that but as we go, as I grew older, I began to understand that their problems were their problems.  And my father and mother both were very close to me in their later years.
Story_ID: 113616
Speaker 1: Now what--when you think about your childhood growing up, what sights, smells and sounds remind you of childhood?
Speaker 2: There are candy smells that are--they, they don't even have anymore.  When they--happen to be in a store and it happens to come through, you know, a mixture of sounds, smells rather, there will stimulate something.  Sounds, well Chicago [Illinois], I grew up in Chicago so there's all kinds of sounds here.  Smells, the thing that I probably missed the least is the stockyards.  Didn't live that far from the stockyards, 34th and Vernon, stockyards was 39th Street and, and Halsted, you know.  And any day you'd get a whiff of that stockyard smell.  Everybody in Chicago knew what that was.
Speaker 1: Pungent.
Speaker 2: Pungent, stinky, terrible, you know.  But that--we grew up with that, you know.
Story_ID: 113617
Speaker 1: Now with--in the--so you're saying in 19, let's see for a second--'49 [1949] is when your brother [Lincoln Levi O'Banion] died, right?
Speaker 2: Forty-eight [1948]
Speaker 1: Forty-eight [1948], I'm sorry, '48 [1948].  And what was--can you describe a little bit what was like after that?  'Cause it sounds like everyone was sort of trying to find their way.  That there was sort of--there had been loss, tremendous loss.  Your mother [Sarah Breckenridge O'Banion]'s, you know I mean the way--what you point there is so--you know what you were describing before sounded wholesome and then afterwards, you know tremendous loss.  So what, what was the family structure? Two, two sons, one away, one son away, one lost.  You know who was sort of a shining star.  Are your mother and father [Julian O'Banion] still having the same jobs?  Was she still working?
Speaker 2: Still a maid, and my father still worked at International Harvester.  And my baby brother [Bertrand O'Banion] and I were basically there in the house by ourselves most of the time.  We had a--I think we did have a babysitter for a while.  While we were young we had a babysitter.  And then as we grew older, then my father left and we basically were there by ourselves.  My mother worked as--worked jobs that took her away for--from Monday through Friday.  'Cause she, you know, suburbs, travel, travel time was more (unclear) for her to stay on the job and so we kind of like held out in the apartment by ourselves.
Speaker 1: So what was the relationship with your baby brother?
Speaker 2: Great relationship, great relationship.  We would, we would play a lot together.  My mother--during the time my mother and father were both there in the house, we play and we might get into a little wrestling match or tussle, you know, in the house.  Or maybe, maybe in anger, maybe not.  But we would wrestle and at about 4:00 when we knew our father was gonna be in there another half an hour or so, we would break the wrestling and clean up the house and then remember how I was holding you yesterday, you know.  Remember this tomorrow.  I had you around the neck and you had me around--the next day we'd get back in the same position and continue to wrestle, you know.  We had a good time together, you know.
Speaker 1: So now your father left in what year?
Speaker 2: About '50 [1950], '51 [1951].
Speaker 1: So like three years after.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Do you think on hindsight that your parents, that it was too much loss or your mother working, or you know or maybe the sorrow she had after, you know.
Speaker 2: I think it was all of that.  I think that the sorrow, the--my mother was kind of cantankerous too, you know, some of the women do, you know, your father this and when March marches in, Clifford marches out, that kind of thing, you know.  And so I think he had enough and he decided just that couldn't handle it anymore and just one day just walked out.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He didn't leave, you know, he didn't leave the scene.  He just didn't live in the house anymore.
Speaker 1: Okay. So you maintained contact some.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But you, you were upset though.
Speaker 2: Initially I was upset, you know I, but you know I got over that.  I remember one time he was gonna tell me something about--he was gonna tell me something about life, he wanted to give me a life, one of those life's state--what you should do as you grow, and I wouldn't hear it.  I got--jumped out of his car and went on home.  But after that we got, you know he was always within hollering distance.  You know I could always go by and see him and that kind of thing.  And--but it was never any--real friction there, you know, never any real friction.
Story_ID: 113618
Speaker 1: Now you are--I wanna also describe church life because all this time were you still active in Hartzell [Memorial United Methodist Church in Chicago, Illinois] and the family--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, can you--so you have a long relationship with Hartzell then.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.  We grew--I grew--was born in that church and as a youth in the youth choir, Mr. Campbell, who was the director of the choir, we rehearsed on Friday night at 6:30, Saturday night at 6:30, and Sunday after services.  And no one would miss rehearsal.  So we were there every Friday, Saturday and Sunday after rehearsals, I mean after services, choir rehearsal.
Speaker 1: So you're talking about what period of, you know, time did that occur?  From the age--from what age to what age?
Speaker 2: About twelve through, to I went away to college.
Speaker 1: So this, so church was really a central part.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now what are you learning from Mr. Campbell?  You know because he entrusted, you know he really was one of your first mentors, right?  Is that true?
Speaker 2: Yes, it's true.  I was singing in the choir.  There was a guy named Nate, Nathaneal McLin came into the choir after, after I got into the choir.  I was--other men that were there that I imitated their voice.  But Nate McLin was a--the husband of Lena McLin, she's the pastor, pastor now.  But they met, they met at Hartzell and married at Hartzell.  Nate was a tremendous baritone voice, fantastic baritone voice.  And I called myself imitating him.  He sang the 'Messiah,' I started to sing the 'Messiah.'  He sang different solos, I started to sing those same solos.  Ultimately became the soloist for the 'Messiah' at the church.  Did the 'Messiah' when I was about fourteen/fifteen years old, sang the baritone solo for that, fourteen/fifteen years old.  That was what it was about, you know.  We--people live--we had many soloists in the, in the, in that church choir.  The church choir was about forty or fifty kids, long, fifty, fifty people in the choir, fifty to sixty people in the choir.
Speaker 1: And the church--in the youth choir.
Speaker 2: Youth choir, yes.  And they ranged from ages from about thirteen all the way up to about thirty-five, some of 'em, you know.  They tried to do it as long as they could, you know stayed in the choir as long as they could.  Quite famous in Chicago at the time, you know.
Speaker 1: So now who was the pastor at the time at Hartzell?
Speaker 2: Well originally the pastor was Reverend B.F. Smith, and then after him, Gamon Morris [ph.], and after him, Howard, Reverend Howard.
Speaker 1: But at the time that you were in your teens, who was it?
Speaker 2: Reverend Smith.
Speaker 1: Reverend Smith, okay.
Speaker 2: Reverend Smith and Gamon Morris, yeah.
Speaker 1: Who was also, in terms of the other churches, who were the other significant churches and, you know and that--'cause Hartzell was--is it Baptist, A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal], Baptist.
Speaker 2: No, it's a Methodist church.
Speaker 1: Methodist.  Is it A.M.E.?
Speaker 2: No, it's Methodist Episcopal at the time, at that time.  Now it's United Methodist Episcopal Church.  But at that time there was, what's that church--Olivet [Baptist Church in Chicago, Illinois] on the corner of 31st Street, which was right around the corner from, from Hartzell.  That was--I'm trying to think of Mr. Campbell's other church.  He, he was director also at a Baptist church.
Speaker 1: So he split time between several--
Speaker 2: He split time between two churches.
Speaker 1: Was that common back then?
Speaker 2: Well for him it was because he had a youth choir in each church.  And when we gave a concert, a lot of his kids, those kids in the other church, Provident Baptist Church [Providence Missionary Baptist Church?], would come over and sing with us.  And when he--choir--when his choir at Provident did a, a concert, we would go over and sing with them.  So he had probably 100 kids under his wings, you know.
Speaker 1: I'm surprised because often, you know, there was a strict, you know, division.  Either you're Baptist or you were Methodist, you know, you didn't sort of--
Speaker 2: Well Mr. Campbell was a person who was able to do--to do his job at both churches and do them very successfully.  In fact my trip to Fisk [University, Nashville, Tennessee], my--I got the scholarship to Fisk was re--as a result of a girl from that church, from Provident, who had gone to, to Fisk and when the Jubilee Singers came to Chicago, she was the one that brought them to my church, to Hartzell, to hear me sing.  I was singing a solo that Sunday.  And that's how I got the scholarship to Fisk.
Speaker 1: And that, I wanna talk about the scholarship, but I wanna go back to Lena McLin, you know.  Because isn't she related to Tom Dorsey, right?
Speaker 2: Absolutely.  She's a niece of Thomas Dorsey, yeah, yes.  You know a lot of history.  That's a, a real long, strong lineage there, yes, yes.
Speaker 1: So were you aware of that?  I mean I'm just--
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: Not at the time.
Speaker 2: Not at the time, no, no, not at the time.  Thomas Dorsey at that time, you know was just like Hartzell, they had this gospel choir and they sang and--what was that church he was at--Pilgrim [Baptist Church], they sang.  So they probably changed choirs from time to time.  And so it's a lot of mixture of church choirs, you know, in terms--in fact the choir was what kept the church communities together.  You know music is a, is a strong influence in the black community.  And we'd have a concert, a gospel concert at Pilgrim or at Olivet, and four, five churches would show up with their gospel choirs.  Or you'd have a youth concert at Hartzell and four or five churches from all over the city would show up at that concert with their choirs.
Speaker 1: So you were--so there's this competition going on, you know.  Who has the best voice in some respects, or who has the best choir, you know.
Speaker 2: Well it wasn't--I would, I would say it's more friendly competition, you know.  If you did--if your choir wasn't at the, at the stage that Hartzell's choir was, you weren't put down for that.  People were encouraging you because they knew that there was something there that would be--that was worth saving, worth, worth developing.  So that's the kind of thing it was--
Story_ID: 113619
Speaker 1: My first solo, I remember when I first started singing, Theo--Theodore Charleston [ph.] was a critic.  And I don't know what I sounded like, but you know to see my name in the newspaper and being praised whatever, you know whatever he said at that time was probably one of the things that, that made me want to continue to sing, you know, but being able to do that.
Speaker 2: When do you think you found your voice?  You know even as a baritone.  Was it the day that you sang at your, you know, your brother [Lincoln Levi O'Banion]'s funeral, or was it after that?  Was it under the tutelage of Campbell or even [Nathaniel] McLin?  I'm just, you know 'cause you were saying that you were trying to copy him.  You know he was--
Speaker 1: Well as I said before, we sang in the house all the time.  We always sang, you know we sang harm--we harmonized as, as four boys.  And when my brother passed, I went to the pastor in 1948 and asked him could I sing the Lord's Prayer in honor of my brother, and I think it was Easter Sunday or something like that.  He allowed--Reverend [B.F.] Smith allowed me to do that.  And I was at that time eleven years old.  But soon thereafter I joined the choir, and I sang in the tenor section for a short period of time.  But you know being the macho boy, I wanted to sing bass 'cause that's were all the men were, you know.  So I started singing--I gravitated to the bass section.  And that was Tribett [ph.], that was Bougie [ph.], there was a bunch of guys, Tank [ph.].  These guys were all singing in the bass section.  I don't, you know--Melvin Heard, Bou--Herb--Herbert, Herbert Robinson was Bougie's name.  And so I sang with them.  And then Nate [Nathaniel McLin] came into the choir and he was such a powerful voice, that I started imitating him.  And, and Lena McLin was a choir, choir accompanist at the time before they, before they got married.  And she was my first accompanist.
Story_ID: 113620
Speaker 1: What was, what was your favorite song at the time?  What reminds you of, of being back in, you know at Hartzell [Memorial United Methodist Church] at that time, what song resonates with you?
Speaker 2: We sang so many songs, so many, I mean rich anthems and Negro spirituals and I mean it's--would be hard even right now in my church choir I have at Hartzell now.  I would like to pull a lot of those old songs, but they're really too difficult for the choir, you know, at this point.  People are not singing the kind of songs that we sang back then.  But as young people, we were challenged to sing complicated stuff, you know.  Trying to think of a couple of numbers--'Hail Bright Abode' from Wagner, from 'Tannhauser,' you know.  Those were very difficult songs.  Toreador song from 'Carmen' was one of the songs we sang.  That was my, one of my solos at--in the choir.  Toreador song.  The 'Messiah,' all of the 'Messiah.'  We, we almost like could sing the 'Messiah' from memory, you know, because we were so familiar with it at that time.  We still sing the 'Messiah' at Hartzell, but it's not the same.  You know these are all older folks now.  But as kids, from 14, 12, 13, 14 years old up to 30 years old, we were singing the 'Messiah.'  The entire 'Messiah,' the entire--from cover to cover, you know, three hours long.  And with soloists and all the other thing.  But no, no orchestra, just piano.  But it was quite a, quite a challenge, you know.
Story_ID: 112135
Speaker 1: So really growing up really, church and music was more predominant than school in many ways.  'Cause you said that school was not especially--I don't know about Phillips [High School, Chicago, Illinois], by the time you got to Phillips, but before that.  I know that you--
Speaker 2: Well let me go back there because Doolittle [Grammar School, now Doolittle Elementary School] had a fantastic music program, fantastic artist program.  I think that's where my brother, my brothers got their, got their start there.  But now I went to Doolittle, you know it was nothing to have a, a Winter concert, four-part harmony with the kids.  These are grammar school kids, four part--and a Spring concert, and it was--we had some very competent music teachers there.  Ms. Malone [ph.] and I think was one of the teachers, and Ms.--trying to remember her name, Cooper, no her name wasn't Cooper.  But those were some very competent music teachers and they taught four-part harmony.  So you--when we sang in the choir, it had--everybody had to sing in the choir in grammar school.  And when I went to high school, we wound into the band and that's how I got the band situation started.  But I had music all through my life in school.  I did join the, the high school choir one year and was not successful in that.  At the same time I was singing in the church choir.  But--so it wasn't a, wasn't a loss for me.  I was really involved in the band in high school.
Speaker 1: Okay, so that--you did talk about that.  Now let me just get clar--clarif--clari--clarification because in your other interview you had talked about maybe it was more Doolittle, but you had a fifth grade teacher who was sort of a turn off, you know who was not maybe encouraging or--
Speaker 2: That was Mr. King.
Speaker 1: Mr. King.
Speaker 2: Mr. King, yeah he was quite a, quite a character.  First off he couldn't control the classroom.  And he would run into the classroom, classroom would be up for grabs.  He'd run in the classroom, run over and smack somebody, you know and that was his, that was his way of getting control of the classroom.  People would then quiet down.  But right now he would be under the jail if he was still teaching, you know, he was there.  But he was quite a, quite a, quite a turnoff in terms of education.
Speaker 1: So he was abusive or--
Speaker 2: He was abusive, yes.
Speaker 1: Was he white or black?
Speaker 2: White, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was abusive.  They didn't--you know he was--I don't know what was wrong with him, he was--some kind of psychological problems, you know.  But he was really not a good teacher, period, you know, definitely.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Story_ID: 112136
Speaker 1: Now you--in, in high school [Phillips High School, Chicago, Illinois] you formed a group called The Three Musketeers?
Speaker 2: That was the guys that came with me.  We were in grammar school together.  We kind of--when we went to high school we gravitated toward each other.  And for about a year or so we just wandered around, you know, doing different things.  Walk--we'd walk each other home after school and that kind of thing.  And we--the three of us wanted to join the band at the same time.  And that's how we got, you know, we kind of kept going, kept The Three Musketeers going, you know.
Speaker 1: And you, you know it, it was interesting to hear how you had started with clarinet, you know that Mr.--was it Earl Patterson?
Speaker 2: Earl Madison, Earl Madison.
Speaker 1: Matterson.
Speaker 2: Madison.
Speaker 1: Is it M-A--
Speaker 2: D-I-S-O-N, M-A-D, Madison, yeah.
Speaker 1: Madison, okay so I--that he, you know you--he gave you the clarinet and then you went home and practiced.  So what, what I see emerging, you were a very discipline--a lot of discipline really, you know.  Was it passion or discipline that was driving your interest in music?
Speaker 2: It was more passion than discipline because when I--after I found the clarinet, I didn't want to put it down.  You know it was just a beautiful sound to me and I really enjoyed it; found out I could do it by myself.  And so I just ran through the beginner's book, you know, two or three weeks, whatever it was.  And was able to you know, basically master as far as you could say, 'master,' master the clarinet at that level, you know.  Enough for him to put me in the intermediate band and the concert band.
Speaker 1: And, and in the, in those bands, I'm just wondering what you're learning progression was.  Because out of first of all Hartzell [Memorial United Methodist Church], you have music, you know.  And it's really choral music, you know, is what you're doing.  And then that's then supplemented by, you know, being in the band, you know and actually playing an instrument.
Speaker 2: Well I think in the choir situation, I did not really study music notes as such.  You know basically wrote, you learn the part, you hung--you know you learn the music.  Somebody's singing next to you and you sing it just like they're singing.  You're looking at the notes.  You're seeing, you're seeing notes, but you're reading the words under the notes and you're not really paying attention to whether the notes are going up or down as much as you are imitating whoever's singing next to you and the piano, what's the piano's playing.  The memory was really very key to that.
Speaker 1: And the natural ear, you're training your natural ear, really.
Speaker 2: Yeah, natural, naturally training your ear.  But in the band situation, you had to read the notes.  And that enhanced the music situation in terms of choral music because I learned how to read first off, playing the clarinet.  And then during that period of time of the band, when Mr. Madison bought a bassoon, then I--and I asked him could I learn to play that and he gave me the book, etc.  Then I learned to read bass clef, which I'd been singing in for, you know, the last year, maybe two, two or three years in the bass section.  But learning the bass clef.  And that was really the, the key.  All that linked up together, my learning, learning curve became much greater as a result of the band.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now in the--tell me how Mr. Madison differed from Mr. Campbell as, you know, as instructors and people who had really significant influence on you?  So how were they different?  Did they know each other?  Was there--
Speaker 2: No, they never met.  I don't think they ever met.  Mr. Campbell was a very gentle and gentlemanly guy in the church.  He was responsible for hundreds of musicians in Chicago who came through that choir at the time that I was there and before.  Mr. Madison was at, at Phillips High School as the band instructor and his style was--he always had an assistant.  Somebody, somebody student assistant.  There was the guy who was their steward, who was there before I came.  As his assistant, he was a student assistant in the band.  And when I, when I--after I became intricately involved in the band program and started imitating things that Mr. Mad--he would ask me to train this new clarinet player over here.  And then he found out I could also assist in tutoring a kid on trumpet or clarinet or whatever it was.  And then I became his assistant in terms of directing.  And he was the kind of person, he would let you--give you the free reign.  I mean he would not stay there and stay on top of you to make sure you did it exactly as he did it, although that was my goal to do it exactly as he did it, you know.  But he would often leave the classroom, leave the room and go, go take a smoke or whatever, you know.  And I'd be there conducting the concert band or intermediate band, you know.  And he'd come back and take attendance and that would be the end of it.  He conducted very, very--I mean he was the pers--kind of person that would give a per--a young person the opportunity to grow.  And that's what he gave to me; an opportunity to grow.
Story_ID: 112137
Speaker 1: And do you--during this time period, you're going to Sherwood [Music School, Chicago, Illinois] also?
Speaker 2: I got a scholarship to Sherwood.  I was working--
Speaker 1: What, now what year?
Speaker 2: Sherwood must have been around my sophomore, junior year probably, junior year.  And that would be about 1953, '54 [1954], something like that.  Summer of 1953, probably.  Working at a cafeteria, Harmony Cafeteria[s] on 11th and Michi--9th and Michigan, rather.  And a guy from Sherwood was--happened to be in the, in the, in the restaurant.  And we started talking.  I was a busboy, and we started talking and he--I told him I sang and he said well I'm at Sherwood.  Come around and let me hear you sing.  So on my lunch period I went around the corner and sang the 'Messiah' or something, I don't know what--sang a couple of songs.  He got so excited, he took me to hear--to the vice president of the university, of Sherwood School of Music, rather, Elsa Harthan Arendt, and she played the 'Messiah' and I sang it and she offered me a scholarship.
Speaker 1: So now how was this experience, you know, different?  Because had you--now I wanna ask this question, though.  Mr. [Earl] Madison, was he white or black?
Speaker 2: He was black.
Speaker 1: He was black, okay.  So here--her name is Elsa Arendt, A-R-E--(simultaneous)
Speaker 2: (simultaneous) A-R-E-N-D-T.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So what is this experience in Sherwood?  I mean how many black students are there in Sherwood at this point?  'Cause you know I--
Speaker 2: Probably--I probably was one of the few.  Probably one of, you know, out of the, out of the entire--I don't know if any--well this guy was--this guy who brought me over there, he was, he was a black student there.  So it must--I couldn't have been the only one.  But Elsa Harthan Arendt and--I mean we did--she had a student recital once a year, you know, and we would, we would all sing or do whatever we did at this recital.  And I'd probably be the only black in that recital.
Speaker 1: So how was that exposure different from, different from, you know--
Speaker 2: From--
Speaker 1: The experience you had had.  You know 'cause your experience had been really more of a South Side experience, even though Sherwood is no longer South Side.
Speaker 2: Well this is more of a formal--this is a, a congealing of my experiences as a singer.  I came there with a voice, I could sing, you know.  But I didn't have the polish or the skills in terms of what a teacher could do for you.  And also Harthan Arendt was a known as an oratorio singer.  You know she did opera.  She was the first soloist on WGN back in the '30s [1930s], you know.  First vocal soloist.  And, but she specialized in oratorical and opera.  And I think that her--what she gave to me was a--something valuable.  She taught me how to interpret, how to sing, how to produce the, the feelings for these songs, for the various songs.  A lot of the oratorio--what, what the meter of their--how you should sing a oratorio, you know, and that was the difference in her--in my education with her.  Now I don't want to get ahead of myself.  What she gave me was enough to last me till I got to Fisk [University, Nashville, Tennessee] and [F.] Bertram Briess gave me the technique on how to produce the right, right kind of sound (unclear).
Story_ID: 112138
Speaker 1: Now [F.] Bertram Briess was where?  Was he at--
Speaker 2: He was at Fisk [University, Nashville, Tennessee].
Speaker 1: He was at Fisk, okay, okay.  So he was there with John Work [III]?
Speaker 2: He was, he was there when I got there.  He was, he was only there for that semester that I came in, in January of '55 [1955].  He and John Work didn't get along too well, you know, but he was a very, very fine man, a German, German origin.  And very deep voice, you know.  But he had a, ability.  When I went there, I think I had a range of G, low G on the bass clef to a high D above the bass clef, high D above C.  He was able to stretch my range by just phenomenal.  I wound up singing low C, low D, below the bass clef, up to a high G above the, in the treble clef on the second land treble clef.  So he gave me technique and a technique that I still use today.
Speaker 1: So really that's--tell me why that's important to have that range.
Speaker 2: Well because it's something that you use when you're, when you're--if you're singing opera.  If you're singing opera, it's good to have a range more than what you can use.  Lot of the baritone ranges from say a G, low, low bass G, I mean the bass clef low G, up to a high A in the treble clef and then, you know, above middle C, A above middle C in the treble clef.  And the bass, bass notes are from say a low E-flat up to about a, a F in the treble clef above middle C.  But it give you great, greater flexibility, you can do more roles.  I've done, I've done Ger--Mr. Germont in 'La traviata,' which is a baritone role.  And I've done a lot of bass roles.  I've done 'The Magic Flute' in bass, bass, the bass part in 'The Magic Flute,' Mozart, so you know it gives you greater range.
Speaker 1: So now you're training extra work, did it consist of doing scale--I mean what was the training there like?  And what, what did you learn from Elsa [Harthan] Arendt?
Speaker 2: Well again, it was--she just voice placement, those kinds of things.
Speaker 1: Breathing?
Speaker 2: Breathing, voice placement, diaphragmatic breathing.  Really concentrating.  Because I played the bass clarinet, I mean the bass clarinet in high school band and the bassoon, you automatically do that naturally, you know because you have to use your breath to control.  But she focuses that and when you're doing the other--focus, focused effort.  So she was able to do that.  And then the basic thing I think that she gave to me was the ability to interpret and to sing with, you know, understanding of what the oratorio was about.  And I must have covered at least six oratorios while I was with her.
Speaker 1: Now was there any concentration or emphasis on her part on learning of languages?
Speaker 2: Well we did learn--we went to Italian, French at that, at that level, and a little German 'cause she was Viennese.  A little German, Italian and French.  But in oratory, oratorio, American oratorio, the oratorio had been sung, and most of that's in English anyway.  So it wasn't that big of a deal.  Now at Fisk because I had to do recitals, we did have to go into German, Italian and French, and some Spanish even.
Story_ID: 112139
Speaker 1: So now is there any baritone that you are just admiring, you know who you wanna be like or at this point?
Speaker 2: Now the baritone that I admire, William McFarland.  McFarland is probably one of the most unsung great baritones in the world.  I heard him.  He gave a recital at Fisk [University, Nashville, Tennessee] after I had left and on one of my returns to Fisk, one of the professors down there allowed me to make a recording of this recital.  He had a recital on tape and I made a recording of it.  And it still amazes me how this man could sing.  His voice was just absolutely exquisite.  I heard him again here in Chicago [Illinois].  You know he had a--they say he had an alcoholic problem.  But he's one of those guys 'cause--be standing on the stage with a glass in his hand and sing, out-sing anybody around him.  You know just a fantastic, fantastic talent.  [HM] William Warfield was another one, a very good voice, very fine voice.  But I think--and then there was another one, there was a tenor, what is his name?  Roland Hayes, fantastic.  First time I heard Roland Hayes I was a student at Fisk.  And this man was in his seventies, a recording of him when he was in his seventies.  And absolutely un--unbelievable what he could do with his voice at seventy-five, seventy-six years old.  You know, but those are some--those are the great voices.
Speaker 1: Now those are all well-known people.  Actually we have, we have William Warfield on camera singing 'Old Man River' in German.  So just as an (unclear).  I didn't know that he had been married to--
Speaker 2: Leontyne Price.
Speaker 1: Leontyne Price.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, yes, yes.
Story_ID: 112140
Speaker 1: So, so you--so music is really all around you and you decided that this is what you want to pursue.  Is this, is this clear because this just sort of--Fisk [University, Nashville, Tennessee] was not a plan for you, right?
Speaker 2: No, it wasn't a plan.  I planned to go to college, you know I really thought all through my high school, yeah I'm going to college when they ask.  What are you gonna do with your--I'm going to college.  But I hadn't thought about any school.  In fact I didn't even know there was a Fisk, that a Fisk existed until this girl from Provident [Providence Missionary Baptist Church, Chicago, Illinois] went down there and that's the first I heard of it.  And when she came back with the Jubilee Singers and they came to, you know, a few of them came to Hartzell [Memorial United Methodist Church] to hear me sing and then I went to meet Mr. [John] Work [III] at the YMCA [Young Men's Christian Association] there on 50th and Indiana, that was my exposure to Fisk.  But my plan was, because Mr. [Earl] Madison had been a captain in the [U.S.] Army, had Army band.  My plan was if I didn't get a college scholarship, I was gone go and join the Army and try out for OCS [Officer Candidate School], Officer's Training School or whatever you call it.  And that was my plan in high school until I got the opportunity to go to Fisk.
Speaker 1: So let's talk about--because Mr. Work, he hears you.  He was sort of impatient that day or he had missed something?
Speaker 2: Well they were supposed to be going, getting on the bus, you know, that afternoon.  And three or four of his members are down at Hartzell listening to me sing.  So he was really kind of disturbed, as Mr. Work could get disturbed.  He was not very vocal.  He was not one of those guys that ranting and raving, he would just sit there and you know you'd know he was disturbed because of the way he was shaking his head or the expression on his face.  But so when we got back to, to the YMCA there on 50th and Indiana, he was ready to go.  And they insisted that he take me into the parlor there and my pianist from Hartzell was there and I sang the 'Messiah' for him.  And that was it.
Speaker 1: And then he got so excited really.  I mean you, were you--you weren't aware of his reaction at the time.
Speaker 2: Well, I think I was because I mean I was in--at that point in my life I was impressing people.  You know I was, you know I was, I was big, you know, in terms of what I thought of myself.
Speaker 1: You were getting good reviews.
Speaker 2: Getting good reviews and people were--I mean aah, you know that kind of thing.  So--but he--within a week he wrote me and asked, offered me a--asked me what about--would he be interested in me coming to Fisk.  And then he contacted my high school principal and she told him my, my family couldn't afford that.  And then he wrote me a letter offering me the opportunity to go to Fisk, what he could--whatever he--he would do whatever he could to get me there, and he did.
Story_ID: 112141
Speaker 1: Can you tell me--do you remember your first day arriving on campus?
Speaker 2: Quite momentous.  I arrived at night.  I left Chicago [Illinois] on the train, got to the, got to Nashville [Tennessee] which was segregated at the time.  And the white--
Speaker 1: This is 1955, right?
Speaker 2: Nineteen fifty-five [1955], January 1955.  And white cab driver drove me to Fisk [University, Nashville, Tennessee].  And got to the dormitory, which is now--
Speaker 1: A white or black you said?
Speaker 2: White cab driver, you know he was--picked me up at the, at the station there in Nashville, drove me to the dormitory, which was darkened.  They had darkened--they turned out all the lights.  And so he got my bag and took it to the door, but he came back, you know like he was really kind of scary, you know.  He got in the cab and drove on off.  And I went into the, into the lobby of the--foyer of the dormitory.  And it was quiet.  I became aware of the presence of people around me.  And these guys were waiting for me.  And so they gave me quite a welcome when I got there, you know.  Quite a welcome.
Speaker 1: So what did you--what was that experience?  'Cause Fisk at this point, now who's the president at, at this point?
Speaker 2: At that time it was Charles S. Johnson, the sociologist, great sociologist.
Speaker 1: Was he the first black president?
Speaker 2: First black president of Fisk University, yes, yes.  He's directly from the Harlem Renaissance.  He had come to Fisk and taught in sociology department, great sociologist.  And then he became the president, first black president of Fisk University.  He was along with Langston Hughes.  He was--in fact he was the majordomo of the Harlem Renaissance.  They said and some of the books I've read on Harlem Renaissance, if you didn't meet with his approval, you weren't a part of that, that thing.  So all of these guys from the Harlem Renaissance were under his tutelage.  And I--I hate the word tutelage, but under his purvey, you know, purveyance.
Speaker 1: So what was the Fisk University that you entered into?  It's 750 students.
Speaker 2: Seven hundred fifty, 700 students, so yeah.
Story_ID: 112142
Speaker 1: So it's 750 students and you are--what, what is the--you know 'cause Fisk [University, Nashville, Tennessee] is known to have been class, you know, oriented, you know, high yellow.  Was, was there any--did you experience that, or was it just because you had this talent, you know and you were--you had your niche there?
Speaker 2: No.  I mean that--the, the idea that Fisk was a high yellow school was a, you know, a myth.  That was not really true.  You had a wide variety of students from all over the country, probably some from around the world were there at Fisk when I was a student there.  Jean Lightfoot, the girl who--Gene Harvey at the time, Harvey Lightfoot now, Dr. Lightfoot.  But she was the one who--from, from Providence [Missionary Baptist Church, Chicago, Illinois] that came to Hartzell [Memorial United Methodist Church, Chicago, Illinois] and, you know, to bring the group there to hear me sing.  She was not a light girl at all, not at all.  She's brown, nice chocolate brown skin sister.  Sang in Jubilee Singers.  And that was a variety of colors, you know, wasn't anything like that.  As--at Fisk I remember I had one suit, maybe several pairs of pants, but nobody, you know they didn't discriminate.  A result of your, your status as, you know rich kids--of course there were people down there whose parents had money.  Still like that at Fisk.  People have that have money and there are people who just barely there on scholarship or barely making it, you know.  But well-rounded, well-rounded kind of atmosphere.
Speaker 1: So who were some of the, who were some of the professors there at the time?  Was Arnauld Bontemps there?  Was he--
Speaker 2: Arnauld Bontemps was the head librarian.  Theodore Currier was the John Hope Franklin's teacher, mentor, was there at the time.  In fact, that was my favorite--my other favorite class besides music classes.  I took a overload of history because of Currier.  He was my--matter of fact he was my first, my first experience in his class was I was a freshman.  I should not have been in his class.  I was--he was teaching U.S. history and I entered in the middle of the year.  So I was way be--a whole half semester behind.  And I got a F on the first final exam, first exam, mid-semester exam because I just didn't know how to take notes.  You know I'm sitting there, he's lecturing and he would talk about something happened up on the strip of the--on Jefferson Street and then he'd throw in something about his, his lecture some, some subject matter and I didn't know where to take--how to take notes.  And it was just a horrible experience.  But I decided I'd go to the library and I'd read everything that he was talking about, read all the books and get as much information as I could.  And I ultimately passed the class, you know, passed that class, that U.S. history class and I took the first year the following semester, and then I took some other history classes with him.  I could have had a second major in history when I graduated from Fisk 'cause I took so many of his classes.
Speaker 1: So really your interest in education peaked then.  It was a--you know 'cause you had said you couldn't get into Fisk on your grades 'cause you were a C, C, you know sort of C student.  But music--is that true?  I mean that--
Speaker 2: Well, no.  I, I had to--well when John Work [III] offered me the scholarship, my grades were probably, I don't know whether below C or what, around C.  But they, they told me then, the principal at Phillips [High School, Chicago, Illinois], at Phillips told me you can't, you can't--you won't be able to go because your grades are not high enough.  So in my senior year, the last year at Phillips, I was able to bring my grades, grade average up in order to be able to enter Fisk.  I was not a 'scholar,' you know like people with a 3.5 and a 4.0 and that kind of thing, but I was a average student coming into Fisk.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now you said--so you come in and do you know you're gonna be a music major?  Is that your intent?  Or teach--
Speaker 2: Yes.  No, I knew I was gonna be a music major because--well when I got the scholarship at Fisk, I was in a dilemma, what I was gonna study, you know.  And Mr. [Earl] Madison said well you know you're a--you know you're music, you know, why not take music as your major?  So I did that, you know.  So I, I came to Fisk as a music major with intent of singing, not teaching, actually.  I was gonna go to New York and hang out in the, in the city until I got a major role at Metropolitan [Opera] or some other opera company.  Which of course never happened.
Speaker 1: Now it's Bertram you said that was the--what was the, the music person before Work came on?  No you said your first semester.
Speaker 2: My first semester [F.] Bertram Briess was--
Speaker 1: Bertram, right.
Speaker 2: Bertram Briess was my first vocal teacher.
Speaker 1: But [John] Work [III] was there because Work had recruited you.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.  Work was over Jubilee Singers, over the department, music department--
Story_ID: 112143
Speaker 1: Okay.  Can you talk about [John] Work [III]?  Like his background.  Because he had a very esteemed background.
Speaker 2: Well as much as I know about it.  He's a third, John Work, III.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And all--both, both his father and grandfather were professors at Fisk University [Nashville, Tennessee].  He--as I understand it from the 125th anniversary of the Jubilee Singers.  We were down there doing interviews, etc.  One of the girls, one of the women who was--who preceded me in the interview room, such as we're doing right now, informed me, informed the camera at the time that the Jubilee Singers had, had fallen out of existence and Mr. Work was the one that brought them back into existence.  And that was in the forty, early '40s [1940s], late '30s [1930s] of that time.  But he actually--the book that I brought 'Lost Delta Found' will give you a great history of him in terms of his importance in what he, what he actually did in terms of preserving the culture of music in the black community.
Speaker 1: He was also trained I read at Ju--what is now Julliard [School, formerly the Institute of Musical Art in New York City, New York] and I think he spent some time at Columbia [University, New York City, New York].  But you know that's what I read.  But he was def--I think Columbia and--advanced degree at Columbia and you know what, what then became Julliard.  So he--what was he like?  Can you describe him as a per--
Speaker 2: Mr. Work was probably the most perfect gentleman you would ever want to meet.  He was never, he never (unclear) always calm and cool in terms of his, his demeanor.  I sat right by him, to his right at the basses sang, sang over there by his right, sopranos, altos and tenors sang out in front of him in rehearsal.  And so I got a chance to be up close.  I made it my point to be up close and personal with him, you know, in terms of watching him act, or watching him play the piano, watching him direct the group, you know, these kinds of things.  Very, very patient man, and very knowledgeable.  Just tremendously knowledgeable.  As a composer, you know as you know I'm director of the John Work Chorale.  One of the reasons why we chose the name John Work Chorale because we were so--the first group of people that came from Fisk that comprised the John Work Chorale back in 1960, were so enamored with his harmonies, with his concepts of music, that we decided that we wanted to promote that.  So we became the John Work Chorale and I got his permission to use his name for our group, for the singing group.  But his harmonies and his understanding of music was of, of harmony and of the Negro spiritual and the settings of which he took these, these tunes and made harmonies and, and compositions out of them, just amazing.  You know very, very highly intelligent person, highly intelligent--
Story_ID: 110550
Speaker 1: Let's talk about what you know of the background of the Fisk Jubilee Singers.
Speaker 2: Okay.  In 1871, Dr. George L. White, being impressed with the sounds that he heard coming from the barracks where the students stayed at night, being impressed with those sounds, decided to get together a group of people and train them to sing so he could raise some money, you know.  And their first efforts were to sing the songs of the particular songs that the people were singing, the anthems, and I don't know, show tunes or whatever it was at the time.  But they were doing these songs and they were meeting with relatively mild success in terms of touring.  And one of the concerts, one of the students suggested that they--or he suggested that they sing one of their songs that they sang in the barracks.  And they were resistant to that because they didn't wanna--people to--you know they was trying to get away from the slave songs and so they were trying to, to impress people with the modern what--at that time, the music of that time.
Story_ID: 110551
Speaker 1: But at any rate, he [Dr. George L. White] was impressed with them and he wanted them to sing and they resisted because they didn't want, you know, they were, they were fresh out of slavery, they didn't want to bring that back into play.  But at one of the concerts, one of the students started singing one of the spirituals.  And it was such a tremendous reception for that, that they started including them on the program.  Then they were invited to, to a conference, church conference.  I forget the name of the guy who was doing it, one of the big, big evangelist at the time invited them to a conference.  And they went to that conference and they sang and overwhelmed, they were, were acceptable, accepted, I put it that way, ovation after ovation for the songs they were singing.  They were primarily Negro spirituals.  Ultimately they were invited to Europe where they sang for Queen Victoria I think.  And they were--did a tour of Europe for about two and a half or so years.  And the Negro spiritual became the--implanted on the globe as a form of art music, beautiful music.  And sparked a whole realm of compositions, people writing and recording and, and doing music.  It was very popular, it was a popular music at the time.
Speaker 2: Do you know any of the people who were doing the writing and recording at that time?
Speaker 1: I have to--actually I would, I would have a difficult time just coming up with it right now.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Most were universities, most were colleges, southern colleges were doing that kind of thing at the time.
Speaker 2: Do you know how some of the original Fisk Jubilee Singers were?
Speaker 1: Maggie Porter, Benjamin--I forget the names.  About--there were nine of them I think, nine names.
Speaker 2: And so they lasted--now George [L.] White was, he was white.  And he was the treasurer for--
Speaker 1: He was the treasurer at Fisk [University, Nashville, Tennessee] trying to find a way to raise money for Fisk, 'cause Fisk was very, very close to closing its doors.  They were without heat and in the cold winter of Nashville, Tennessee.  They were in a struggling situation.  They were--the original building is still there.  They call it Little Theatre now, but it was a barracks actually from the [Civil] War.
Speaker 2: Was that part of Jubilee Hall?
Speaker 1: No, Jubilee Hall was the first building built, built by the funds that the Jubilee Singers raised in Europe.
Speaker 2: Okay.  And really I mean, as much as we romanticize that that was a difficult time period for them too 'cause they worked really under--they were just workhorses.  And they all--a bunch of them got sick, you know.
Speaker 1: Some of--most--some of them didn't finish school.  They were given degrees posthumously, some of them were given degrees posthumously.  But they made a great sacrifice, you know to--and raised the first funds for Fisk University.  Built the first permanent building on a black college campus, which was Jubilee Hall, which still exists.
Speaker 2: Now that--and Jubilee, he--there's some story around how Jubilee came into being, that you know they were down and he, you know he wanted them to be up, you know.
Speaker 1: You mean the song itself?
Speaker 2: No, the--is there a song?
Speaker 1: No, I mean the, the songs, the songs Jubilee sing--you know Jubilee Singers as opposed to Negro spiritual singers.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Well you know the year of Jubilee, you know that's a Biblical thing, you know.  The year of Jubilee, so I think that's where he came up with that concept of Jubilee.  And it was, again, it was a period of time when they were really struggling trying to keep the doors of Fisk open.  You know they'd gone to Indiana, they'd gone to several towns up north to raise funds.  But the big fundraiser was actually when they went to Europe and was able to raise funds, enough funds to build the Jubilee Hall.
Speaker 2: Now there became after that--so they sort of disbanded and fell apart, like after seven, eight years, right?
Speaker 1: Well some of them stayed in Europe.  And I don't, I don't believe they fell apart.  I think they still had a group at Fisk, you know after they came back from Europe, I think they still had a group.
Speaker 2: But there were several groups I had read.
Speaker 1: They're a lot--definitely, definitely.  Colleges around the country.  Then some of those singers who came out of the Jubilee Singers started their own groups and used the name Jubilee.  In fact, there was a big litigation about people using the name Jubilee Singers, you know.
Story_ID: 110552
Speaker 1: Okay. So now Work then re--resuscitates Jubilee Singers, John Work, III, right?  And as I remember, you said there's al--there was also a John Work V, you know, they've cont--
Speaker 2: Still exist, yeah.
Speaker 1: Still exist.  But John Work, III was clearly--he had started at Fisk [University, Nashville, Tennessee], Fisk in 1927.  So by the time you arrived, he's been there almost thirty years, right, okay.  Now tell me what you, what your world is like.  What is--how are you maturing as a, a, a person, as a singer?  What is college campus life around, you know, like?  Who are the other, you know, the black colleges and who are you competing with, or you know, you know singing.  I'm just trying to get a sense of that.
Speaker 2: Okay, well my life at Fisk was a gas, it was just absolutely beautiful.  More than I could possibly ever expect.  I went to Fisk out of the ghettos of Chicago [Illinois].  Wasn't called a ghetto then, but out of Chicago.  And got down there, it's a beautiful campus.  Lot of room to run.  Had my own room with my roommate who was from Jamaica, I think he was from.  Austin Beavers [ph.], my first roommate down there.  I lived on the fourth floor in Livingstone Hall, which had a--looked out over a grove of magnolia trees, you know that--and across the, across the way about a half a block down was another dormitory, women's dormitory.  The magno--the rumor at Fisk is if you saw the magnolias bloom the second year, I mean the, the first year if you saw the magnolias bloom, you knew you'd made it because magnolias were a beautiful, big beautiful smelly flower.  Beautiful, beautiful aroma flower.  And we had a grove of these, maybe fifteen, twenty of them right outside the dormitory.  The freedom of being able to traverse that campus and, you know, meet people and do the kinds of things that you would do was just unbelievable, you know from my perspective as a, as a Chicagoan going down there.  I was able to, to go to class.  You know you had the freedom of going to class or not going to class.  Of course you had to choose whether or not you wanted to stay there or not.  So I went to class all the time.  You had a, a little joint across the street on Jefferson Street, a beer hall that we, that was really a favorite place of ours to hang out, you know.  That was of course the fraternity and sorority life.  And--
Speaker 1: What did you pledge?
Speaker 2: I pledged Omega, Omega Psi Phi after I came back from Europe.  But that was another thing that European--my first tour, tour--first trip with the Jubilee Singers was in Jackson, Mississippi.
Speaker 1: So let me ask you--so when you were brought on, it was, was it automatic that you were gonna be part of the Jubilee Singers when you got your schol--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: I just wanna get that.
Speaker 2: I was the first--young man from, from Waco, not Waco, Texas, from Amarillo, Texas were brought under the same time.  We both were--entered as freshman and both of us became Jubilee Singers.  I guess Mr. Work had heard him when he--on a tour to Texas (unclear).  Lawrence Fortson and I became partners at--in Jubilee Singers.
Speaker 1: Fortson, F-O-R--
Speaker 2: T-S-O-N, Fortson.  And you know I, my--in the first year, my first semester, actually within a couple of months, I was in, in--was it Jackson or Meridian, Meridian, Mississippi singing with the Jubilee Singers.  And toured, you know, the United States with them from that point on.
Story_ID: 110553
Speaker 1: I went to Europe in 1956, which was something that we were building toward.  And that was a great, that was probably the greatest experience, going to Europe and being able to go to nine countries singing sixty-six concerts in fifty-six days.
Speaker 2: That's your--you said what year is that?
Speaker 1: Nineteen fifty-six [1956].
Speaker 2: So that's your sophomore year.
Speaker 1: Yeah, sophomore year, right, right.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay.  And so was this, was this European tour, was it an end--did it happen every so often?
Speaker 1: No.  Somehow or other--entrepreneur, a guy from, from California convinced Mr. [John] Work [III] and Fisk University [Nashville, Tennessee] to allow him to become the arranger of the tour.  I forget the name they call it now.  But he was--he arranged the tour.  We were supposed to make money, I don't think we did.  But we did make a lot of good, good publicity in terms of the university itself.  But we didn't make any money.  But it was a, a very exciting trip.  It took seventeen students, Mr. Work and his wife and accompanist.  And sang to standing, standing ovations all over Europe.
Speaker 2: So how many--you said you were--how long was the tour you said again?
Speaker 1: It was two, two months, two months, two and a half months.  We got back--we left in September and got back in December.
Speaker 2: How, how many performances in those two months?
Speaker 1: Sixty-six performances in fifty-six days.
Speaker 2: So you were trav--so there wasn't a lot of down time.
Speaker 1: No, no, no.  We--you'd leave one town and go to another town by bus.  I think we went on, went on a plane once.  But we basically--the tour was by bus.
Speaker 2: So what were you learning during this experience?  I mean you haven't been out of the states at all before, you know.  Much, well much like the original Fisk Jubilee Singers when they went to Europe, you know.
Speaker 1: Yeah well all, for all of us.  It was a brand new experience.  None of us had been--I don't think anybody--probably we had--I think we did have one or two G.I.'s guys who were on the G.I. Bill who were in the Singers at the time.  But the rest of us never had, had been out of the states.  And so this was a brand new experience.  When we first got to, to the first part of our tour was in Germany I think.  First, first place that we landed.  And the con--the accommodations were not what everybody expected.  They were--they had been on a boat, on the Liberte coming over on the Atlantic [Ocean] and just fantastic rooms and services and stuff like that and you get in these little Class A, Class 2 hotels over there and they're not quite as luxurious as the boat was.  So people were complaining about that initially.  I, myself did not participate in the complaints 'cause I was just so happy to be there, you know.  And this--I had made a decision to enjoy the trip because of what the circumstances were.  And so we had really--I really had a good time.  I think that everybody else did ultimately, you know, but the initial thing was, was quite stressful for Mr. Work because they were holding him responsible.  This hotel is not this and this and that.  Well he said you know this is my first time too.
Speaker 2: Right.  So now what--how are you keeping your voice up with that schedule?  Is it just you were young and you know, excited, the adrenaline didn't really--
Speaker 1: Didn't think about the voice.  The voice was there and I just used it, you know, up until recently I never thought about the voice.  I just sang, you know.  But as you get older, you of course you can feel the phlegm and the little strain on the voice, vocal chords.  But I still sing, you know somehow I use [F.] Bertram Briess' methods and overcome, sing over that, you know.  But at that time it was no--it wasn't even a thought that, you know, you could lose your voice or anything could happen.
Speaker 2: Do you remember any performance specifically from that trip?
Speaker 1: I remember particularly we used Paris [France] as our base.  We'd go, we'd go from some--go to Germany, come back to Paris, go to another place, come back to Paris.  And it was at the Salle Gaveau in Paris, which is a piano studio in Paris with a fantastic, I think about four or five tier auditorium.  If you know the auditoriums in Europe, you have the first floor and then you have surrounding tiers that surround the first floor.  And in that concert, about our second concert, second or third concert in Paris.  And we were surrounded.  They had put bleachers up on the stage behind us.  And we had been used--by that time we had been used to having standing ovations, doing four or five encores in concerts all over Europe.  But this was probably the most spectacular because we had people behind us as well as in front of us, and the place was packed.  And again, they gave us four or five ovations.
Story_ID: 110554
Speaker 1: Now in the, in this whole process and at that time if Paris [France] was your base, wasn't Josephine Baker a big thing in, in Paris at the time?  Did you remember hearing any--
Speaker 2: I was not aware of that.
Speaker 1: Not aware.
Speaker 2: I was just too busy having fun.
Speaker 1: I see, okay.  Well you're the, you're the toast of Europe in many ways.
Speaker 2: Yes, right, right, right.  I mean they were--we landed--the first concert I think was in Germany of course.  But after that first, first concert was, you know kind of half-filled house.  But after that, from that point on, the word traveled and every house was packed.
Speaker 1: So now how are your studies when you're touring like this?  Was this--it wasn't during the summer was it?
Speaker 2: No it was during the school year.  We left in September, first part of September and stayed until December.  Actually--
Speaker 1: But it was--it was considered part of the music program or such a big deal?
Speaker 2: No, it was just a separate thing altogether.  And actually what they expected--we had a couple of extraordinary, extraordinarily smart students in that, in the group.  And they were supposed to be our tutors for me, myself.  But who had time to study, you know?  We were having too much fun.  I never opened a book.  I played chess on the trains.  I played chess with a chess master in, in Germany on, on a plane, on the train going through Germany.  You know those were things--it was too--it was learn--you were learning, just different things.  It was a, was a learning experience.  The whole thing was a learning experience.  So you didn't have time to sit down a read a book of history, well you're living history, you know.
Speaker 1: So you were actually--you were gone a semester essentially, right?
Speaker 2: Almost a semester yeah, almost a semester.
Story_ID: 110555
Speaker 1: So when you come back, are you thinking at that point, like what are--where are you spending your summers?  Are your summers in Chicago [Illinois] or are you--
Speaker 2: Well up to that point I was spending my summers in Chicago.  And my mother [Sarah Breckenridge O'Banion] had moved out of the projects and moved to a place on 40th, 46th and Evans, which was absolutely the pits, you know absolutely the bot--the bottom of the barrel in terms of what you had drug--druggies on the corner of 40, 47th and, and Evans.  We were in the 4600 block, 47th and Evans.  Had to go through taverns and all that kind of thing.  So I complained enough until she went out and found a place where the, where the Dan Ryan Expressway runs now, was a house there.  For the first time we lived in a house in Chicago.  And then I applied to work with the Santa Fe Railroad [Santa Fe Railway].  And I made--probably made two trips--two or three trips during '57 [1957], summer of '57 [1957].  And summer of '58 [1958]--summer of '57 [1957], I worked on the railroad.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But up until that point, you know there was not too much of anything going on--
Story_ID: 110556
Speaker 1: Then what happened in the summer of '58 [1958] and the summer of 50--well '59 [1959] you graduate.
Speaker 2: Well summer of '58 [1958] was a very good summer.  That--I was happened to be in Mr. [John] Work [III]'s office just before summer began and he got a phone call.  And he turned away from the phone and said what are you doing this summer?  And I said nothing, I'll probably work at the railway.  He said how would you like to go to New York and, and sing at Radio City [Music Hall]?  I said wow, yeah, okay, you know.
Speaker 1: This is a dream, right?
Speaker 2: This is a--
Speaker 1: Because you had decided that's what--
Speaker 2: This was a dream, part of, part of fulfilling one of my dreams.  So what it was, was the woman who was department chair at, at Tuskegee Institute [Tuskegee, Alabama] called him and asked him if he had a soloist that could sing 'Old Man River.'  They were going to New York to celebrate the 25th anniversary opening of Radio City Music Hall, which they had opened in twenty-five years prior to that.  And so there was, there was a celebratory thing where they had invited 'em back for the 25th anniversary.  And so I said okay, good, you know.  And went down to Tuske--flew down to Tuskegee, rehearsed down there for about a week or so and then went to New York and sang at Radio City Music Hall.
Speaker 1: So what--and you said it was the occasion of the 125th ann--
Speaker 2: The 25th anniversary of, of, of Radio City Music Hall.
Speaker 1: Wow, you wouldn't even think it was that old sort of, you know.
Speaker 2: That was in 1950, 1958, yeah.
Speaker 1: Now when you--and there were the Rockettes on the program.
Speaker 2: Rockettes on the program, the whole nine yards.  Really 'No Time for Sergeant[s]' was the movie, starring Andy Griffith, I think.  And then we had this 'Show Boat' extravaganza and the Rockettes and the, and the Tuskegee [Institute] Choir were a part of that.  And it was really an elaborate stage, stage show.
Speaker 1: And that was for how long during the summer?  Was it, was it six weeks?
Speaker 2: For a month.
Speaker 1: A month, okay.
Speaker 2: A month, for the month of June we did that.  And then after that I went and got a job working upstate New York in a, in a country club as a cook.
Story_ID: 110557
Speaker 1: Now were you thinking that at that point that you could come to New York after graduation and that was your thought, or--
Speaker 2: I was thinking--in fact, in fact I was thinking that after I finished at Radio City Music Hall, the doors would be flying open to bring me in to sing at the operas and stuff like that, but it didn't happen, you know.  Fifty-eight [1958] was still--basically the country is still segregated, but then it was still a little bit more.  If you looked at, if you look at the number of soloists that I've named, just the three soloists I've named, none of them finished at the top of the game like the female black soloists have, you know, none of them, you know.  But--
Speaker 1: You know that, that is true you know because I mean Paul Robeson, he sang 'Old Man River.'  But he, politically was--that was--
Speaker 2: He was politically--they, they, they assassinated him politically.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So he couldn't do anymore work.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: [HM] William Warfield was at the top of his game.  He never really got to be at that point.  [William] McFarland almost did, you know he almost--I think he did sing at the Metropolitan [Opera House].  But it was short-lived, you know.  One of the things I think is that when you do that kind of thing, you have these operatic roles, you know, you have these macho operatic roles and they basically are written for white males, not for black males, except for Othello, you know.  But they're not really into putting that black male on the stage singing with his, with this white woman, you know.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: Not willing to do that.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: Now they'll put a, a white man on stage with black face, you know, at any time.  They, they've had many white, white opera singers sing Othello with a blackened face.
Speaker 1: And I know a lot of--actually I remember interviewing [HM] Etta Moten Barnett and she was, you know a lot of people got put into that 'Porgy and Bess,' you know that was the only thing that they could, you know, could do.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: Like you were saying 'Old Man River' which is from 'Porgy and Bess.'  No, this from Show, I'm sorry, 'Show Boat'
Speaker 2: 'Showboat' and 'Porgy and Bess,' yeah.
Speaker 1: And 'Porgy and Bess,' right.
Speaker 2: Well same thing.  Same, same thing.  They, they had all, all, all Negro casts, you know just about.  Very predominant Negro cast, and that's where you got a chance to shine and sing.
Speaker 1: But that would be to the delight of black and white audiences, though.
Speaker 2: Yeah, well you know, it was also stereotypical.
Speaker 1: Right, it was stereotypical, that's right, that's right.
Speaker 2: And black folks were so, so eager to see themselves on stage.  That's why that--that those things of black exploitation movies became so popular because we never seen ourselves in any kind of, any kind of settings that would be, would be perhaps complimentary to us.  So you know, that's one of the things--
Story_ID: 110558
Speaker 1: So when you returned for your senior year, what are you thinking then?  'Cause you had taken as I remember, a music education course, you know thinking that you might teach.
Speaker 2: I might teach, yeah.  Well I, I took enough education courses while I was there because I did my electives.  So I took you know, public school music and that kind of thing and pedagogy, that kind of thing.  So that enabled me to--in case there was some slippage on the side I would be able to go into educational system somewhere.
Speaker 1: And so what is, what is John Work [III]?  Is he mentoring you at this point?  I mean 'cause I, you know I think you had--was he mentoring or wasn't he--who were you talking to about what you were gonna do post-graduation?  You know I mean he had made this opportunity come that one summer.
Speaker 2: Well the thing about it, see the word mentoring is a whole new--that's a totally new word in our community because we--Mr. Campbell was not a mentor.  He was just my choir director.  But you know today when you look at it, you say he was my mentor, you know.  Mr., Mr. [Earl] Madison was not a mentor 'cause we didn't use those words.  He was my band teacher, but he was really a mentor and we look at it in today's concept.  Mr. Work was, was probably even less along that line because he did not sit down and counsel me as such.  He was just a person that I, you know, related to.  I could go to his house, eat his chili, his wife's chili, talk to them, talk to, talk to he and his wife.  A whole group would be over there.  I'd meet him in the, in the music building along with the other professors, you know, but just a kind of thing.  He was never a person who would sit down--I don't think they had that kind of thing at Fisk [University, Nashville, Tennessee] where they would sit down and say this is what you're going to do.  You were just so glad to get out of that school, you know.  When you get out of school, period, that by the time you graduated, you were, you know you had accumulated a certain amount of hours and people there.  Everybody was a mentor I think.  If want to look at it as mentor, I think all of the faculty were like mentors at Fisk, you know, because you interacted with different people in different ways.  And they--nobody would let you fall if you, you made it to--through your first year, you wouldn't fall.
Story_ID: 110559
Speaker 1: So you actually with that--and I'm--what I was getting ready to say is that he [John Work, III] was also getting up there in age too.  You know he was, you know he was older.  He was born in 1901.  So--
Speaker 2: He was in his sixties, something like that.
Speaker 1: He was in--right.
Speaker 2: Now the other thing about that is that he had had a heart attack in Europe.  And so he--one of the tours--
Speaker 1: You mean when you were tra--
Speaker 2: While we were traveling.  He had, he got sick and Charles S. Johnson died while we were in Europe.  And that was a very close friend of his.  And shortly after--he was, he was you know, borderline ill when he went to Europe.  But he'd actually had a, a--some complications while he was there and could not make one of the tours of Europe.  In fact we had--I don't know if he went to--I don't know if it was Italy that he couldn't make or not.  But one of the tours he stayed in Paris [France] and we went on and did our, did our thing.
Speaker 1: So, so this would have been--I mean stressful in many ways.  'Cause think about it.  You know he hadn't been to Europe before, you know.  This is a, a man who, you know is--was very educated.  So this was a big, big deal.  I don't know--have the Fisk Jubilee Singers been in Europe since their, you know what was the period of time like?  You know 18-whatever, the 1860--
Speaker 2: Eighteen seventy--was 1873.
Speaker 1: So have there been tours in between this 1873 and your tour?
Speaker 2: Not that I know of.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know there might have been tours of other groups that used the name Jubilee Singers, but not that I'm aware of.
Speaker 1: Right.  So this would have been a huge deal.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: You know, and, and so he has the stress.  You know it's a lar--it's relatively large group of you.  It's not eight.  And you know, and people were complaining, you know and all of that.  So that could have been a lot of stress.  So in the meantime, his, his friend as you say, you know who's the president [of Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee], dies.  So he's not there for the funeral?
Speaker 2: No, we couldn't--nothing we could do about that.  We were in Europe.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: The methodology of trans--of transportation was boat, you know and it's five days, at least five days.
Speaker 1: Right.  So when you--what--so who becomes president after that, that's your last--
Speaker 2: Steven J. Wright.  We have a long period of interim president.  And when I got back to Fisk in 1958 after singing at Radio City [Music Hall], Steven Wright was the president.
Story_ID: 110560
Speaker 1: Now you--tell me also who were the people that became your friends out of Fisk [University, Nashville, Tennessee]?
Speaker 2: You mean while I was at Fisk, or--
Speaker 1: I'm sorry, right.
Speaker 2: Well Lawrence Fortson and was my, was my compadre when we, we--
Speaker 1: Both singers, right.
Speaker 2: Both singers.  We ultimately became roommates.  There were James Green [ph.]  who was in Chicago this weekend, haven't seen him in a long time.  Fred Work was there, Mr. [John] Work [III]'s son was there.  In fact Mr. Work's son was the first black into Vanderbilt University [Nashville, Tennessee] on a--he was a--he went to the law school there, you know.  In fact he was--he went to law school while we were in Europe.  So that was stressful also for Mr. Work 'cause you know, he didn't know what was gonna happen at that time because it was not--segregation had not occurred in the South, desegregation had not occurred in the South in '58 [1958].  Whatever it was, '56 [1956] rather.  Just a, a plethora of friends, you know, of people, women, men and that kind of thing, that, that were there, that were just you know good people, you know.  And that's what you did when you went to--at Fisk.
Story_ID: 110561
Speaker 1: Now William [L.] Dawson came what year?
Speaker 2: He came in 1958.
Speaker 1: So your last.
Speaker 2: My last year there.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And--
Speaker 2: Blessed, blessedly for me.
Speaker 1: So talk about that.
Speaker 2: Well, William Dawson--as a kid in the--he was in the choir at Hartzell [Memorial United Methodist Church].  We had been singing Dawson's work along with (unclear).  But we had been singing his works, you know during the entire time I was at Hartzell.  And I think we did a couple of his works while, while I was in the choir at Fisk [University, Nashville, Tennessee], a few times I was in the choir at Fisk.  So him coming to Fisk was like meeting a god, somebody who, I'd had been, I'd been hearing about all of my life, but never thought that I would ever meet him.  And he came to Fisk as a director of the university choir.  And I don't think I ever missed a rehearsal.  And he became what I would call a mentor also because he taught me--he allowed me to direct the choir, you know.  I was his assistant, so to speak.  And in fact he let me direct one of the concerts, let me direct one of the con--one of the numbers, compositions in the concert.  I sang solo under his direction.  He's the first person that took me under his wing to show me how to direct, you know 'cause I was--before it was just, you know, waving your hands.  I mean I was able to keep time and tell people when they're supposed to come in, that kind of thing.  But I didn't know the science of directing, you know, of one, two, three, four; how you do it.  How do you use your hands and that kind of thing.  So he's actually the person that stopped me and says this is what you do right here.  You have to have a down beat.  You have to have an up beat, that kind of thing.  So--but he became very good--close friend of mine after, after he--after I left Fisk and he left Fisk.
Speaker 1: So he was there that year.
Speaker 2: That year, yes.
Speaker 1: The whole year.
Story_ID: 111929
Speaker 1: I'm not certain.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I wouldn't say that they didn't like each other 'cause he [John Work III] brought him [William L. Dawson] to, to, to Fisk [University, Nashville, Tennessee], you know.
Speaker 2: But they may not--they may have had different styles.
Speaker 1: May have had different--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: They were different styles altogether, yes, different styles.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So can, can we talk about that?  So actually that year you talked about being a highlight, and that really Dawson, William Dawson came out of retirement.  Now can we talk first about the Institute Singers, you know institute--
Speaker 1: Tuskegee, Tuskegee Institute Singers.
Speaker 2: Right, right, right.  So what were they like versus the Jubilee Singers versus--I mean that was a whole choir, right?  Okay.  But just tell me--I'm just trying to get a sense of what, you know who, who is known, well-known in these circles, you know.  Are people going between one and the other.  Is there any camaraderie or--
Speaker 1: I'd say put it this way; there was obviously camaraderie 'cause the woman, I forget her name, from Tuskegee called Mr. Work.  So a lot of these schools produced--Fisk might have produced her as a, as a student and she winds up as the chairman of the Music Department there at Tuskegee [Institute, now Tuskegee University in Tuskegee, Alabama].  Now what is his name--the director, Relford Patterson was the director of the Tuskegee Choir  The Tuskegee Choir was a lot, a lot like Fisk University Choir, you know in terms of the music and the repertoire that they do at the time.  Jubilee Singers were not in that category.  A small ensemble.  Mr. Work never directed the Jubilee Singers.  Never stood up on stage and directed the Jubilee, Jubilee Singers.  Much to his credit, he allowed--he trained us so that we knew exactly what we needed to do in order to be effective on the stage, and the music came more out of a soul rather than somebody, single person directing as such.  So that was the difference in, in Mr. Work's style and any other com--any other director, music director.  William L. Dawson was the first, probably the first black in the Chicago Civic Orchestra.  Played trombone at the Chicago Civic Orchestra.  He was really an instrumentalist, you know, as such.  His history at, at Tuskegee, which I think he attended Tuskegee, I'm not, I'm not as well versed on that, but I know, know that he was director of the, of the Tuskegee Institute, Tuskegee Institute Choir.
Speaker 2: He graduated from Tuskegee and then he taught at Lincoln High School in Kansas and then he had--he attended the American Conservatory [of Music] here in Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 1: Here in Chicago, right, right.
Speaker 2: In 1927.  And then he was at Tuskegee from 1931 to 1956.
Speaker 1: But any, any rate, he, his, his directing style was strictly, you know, he was really a, a finite, very fine director as far as music.  Oftentimes he would be so moved in terms of directing that he would stop directing and the choir could continue to go, knowing exactly what he wanted, wanted them to do.  But he was minimal, minimalist director.  He was not a show time director, one of these guys that like you see in the gospel choir.  It was not that kind of thing.  He--lot of times he could direct just in front of the choir, in front of--you wouldn't see what was going on if you were in back of him.  So he was really a, a consummate, what I consider consummate chorale director.  I'm not a--I don't consider myself a showman.  I've had to learn to do a little bit more show, show, show strokes because people want--expect that here in Chicago.  But it's not what I was taught, the way I was taught.
Story_ID: 111930
Speaker 1: You know what's interesting to me?  So you're saying growing up at Hartzell [Memorial United Methodist Church, Chicago, Illinois].  I mean you were singing his [William L. Dawson] compositions.  Now this is, you know this is interesting to me because you were--okay that was the '40s [1940s], '40s [1940s], '50s [1950s], '40s [1940s], '50s [1950s] at Hartzell.  So really things were being composed, I guess that's the case with anything, and sung.  But you know I, I keep thinking what he really--he's in the vein of Negro spirituals, right, so you know it's almost like real time music, though you know I think of it as historic music.  So it's not spirituals in the way that--I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: I think I can help you out.
Speaker 1: Please, thank you.
Speaker 2: There are arrangements of Negro spirituals.  Spirituals were composed, were conceived during the period, you know, pretty--post-war period, pre-war period, Civil War, okay, up until the--sometime in the, in the nine--the 20th century, 1900, 1910, 1915.  In fact the book that I showed you the--Lam--not Lambert Blues, but 'Lost Delta Found,' will give you an idea of some of that.  How even, even later than that spiritual were conceived, but basically conceived as single line melodies that these guys took and added three, four-part, five-part harmony to, you know. (Singing) "I got a robe up in-a that kingdom, ain't-a that good news."  That's a Dawson number that everybody knows about and we sang years ago.  Now--tell you something--Dawson would do and probably John Work [III] too.  Dawson would take a composition that he wrote, say in, in '30s [1930s] or something, and change it around.  He did that with that particular song, 'I got a robe up in-a the kingdom.'  He--somehow after, after coming from Fisk [University, Nashville, Tennessee], he put a whole--when he came to Fisk, he had put a whole new section in that song that wasn't there before that we had sung when we were at Hartzell that was completely new to the song.  But that's the way he would do it.  He would, you know, any composer I think would make those kinds of changes to their music, you know, as they go, as they grow, as they go and grow, you know.  So I think that that's two different--two different styles.  He also wrote a song, the 'Negro Folk's Symphony' [sic, 'Negro Folk Symphony'].  Now that's something that I'd love to hear Chicago, Chicago Symphony Orchestra do, which is based on Negro spirituals. Fantastic composition, fantastic composition for a full orchestra.  It was done by Arturo Toscanini at, at the Philadelphia I think did it, Philadelphia Orchestra did, did it.  And Toscanini was the conductor of that; they collaborated on doing it.
Speaker 1: So it's symphonic music and Negro spirituals.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Vocal and, and just, okay.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.  Well same thing with John Work [III].  John Work wrote a series of songs for orchestra, for small ensemble, for large ensembles, you know, as well as choral music and solo music, you know, for soloist, singers, solo singers.
Story_ID: 111931
Speaker 1: Now these, these--[Thomas A.] Dorsey would--Dorsey, [John] Work [III] and [William L.] Dawson all know each other?  Sort of, or Dorsey was a--out of a different--I'm just trying to get--
Speaker 2: Dorsey would be out of a different era.  You know, because he--
Speaker 1: Different tradition.
Speaker 2: Different tradition.  His is basically--he was really a jazz musician, you know, initially when he, when he lost his child or wife, then he became a--he went to the--
Speaker 1: Gospel.
Speaker 2: To the gospel range, you know.
Speaker 1: Gospel.
Speaker 2: Spiritual music, you know, church music thing.  So his is a different, different thing altogether.  They might have known each other.  I wouldn't say they didn't, because most musicians during that time, Dawson with--(simultaneous)
Speaker 1: (simultaneous)--Because the time periods are--(simultaneous)
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) If Dawson came to Chicago [Illinois], he would meet Dorsey. (simultaneous)
Speaker 1: (simultaneous)--He's older.  Well is he older?  The time periods would have been around--
Speaker 2: They would be close to the same age.
Speaker 1: Around the same age, okay.
Speaker 2: They about the same age, maybe the same age, you know.
Speaker 1: Now because when you look at it, when you look at it, it's a very vibrant period.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Musically, I mean a lot of sort of happening.
Speaker 2: Is going on, right.
Speaker 1: Well one is the, the setting to paper, the music of the slave era, you know, and the preservation, you know, of it.  The other is--and the mainstreaming of it in sort of a way, you know, that had begun I guess--
Speaker 2: Well the Jubilee Singers mainstreamed it.
Speaker 1: Mainstreamed it, right.
Speaker 2: The Jubilee Singers were the one that brought it to the forefront and, and perpetuated it for, you know, X amount of years.
Story_ID: 111932
Speaker 1: Were there any discussions with you or tutelage, you know, of what it meant to be a Fisk Jubilee Singer?  Was there any about the honor or the tradition or, you know what your role had to be or anything like that?
Speaker 2: No, never, you know.  The thing about it, and that's a--the thing that--one of the idiosyncrasies of, of a universe like this.  They don't bother to tell you these kinds of things, you know.  It was, you know it was just a matter of fact kind of thing.  I was here in Chicago [Illinois] and next I'm in Nashville [Tennessee] and I'm a Jubilee Singer.  But you don't real--the impact of that doesn't really occur until after you've left the university and you realize I saw [HM] John Hope Franklin, I was talking to him.  I was talking to Arnaud Bontemps.  I talked to Langston Hughes.  I was, you know, had drank a beer with Langston Hughes, you know.  These kinds of experiences are invaluable, but you don't realize them because you're so young and you, you, you run--I say young and stupid, you know.  'Cause you really don't realize the history.  Our history is so, so varied and so rich, we just take a lot of it for granted right now.  You know we--the things we're doing right even in, in 2008, a lot of stuff is happening.  The concert I spoke to you about that had occurred on Sunday was monumental concert, monumental.  They had my group, they had a group of female drummers called the Drum Divas.  And there was about twelve, four-fourteen of them on the stage, and they opened the program up in the African style.  And then the Jub--my John Work Chorale came on and sang four spirituals to this packed house at DuSable Museum.  And then after that, George Cooper who is a Fisk [University, Nashville, Tennessee] graduate, came on and played, played one of his com--played a Chopin composition, sang a solo to music that he had programmed into a computer and made a disc off of.  And then played one of his compositions, one of his, his composition.  And after that, the three, three sopranos [The Three Sopranos].  One of the girls who is Deborah Rountree-Wahid [ph.] who is a Fisk graduate.  They put this program together and she had these three, two other women, fe--females that sang, two other sopranos, and they sang and ended the program with 'Porgy and Bess' skit which incorporated the entire cast.  Closing out with '[Oh Lawd,] I'm on My Way' from 'Porgy and Bess.'  Fantastic, fantastic program.  And you know we as a people, we don't, we--you know we--we supported it because the people had to sell tickets to raise the funds for Fisk.  But I mean the community, wide, wide range community of Chicago completely unaware of that, that that's happening--(simultaneous)
Speaker 1: (simultaneous) --Right.
Story_ID: 111933
Speaker 1: We still have to work on that because you know when you even discuss the whole thing with the churches, you know and the lack of men and the lack of, you know, bass, you know bass in the songs.  But let--so some of the other songs that [William L.] Dawson is known for, find my--is it 'Finding my Step'? 'Great Day.'
Speaker 2: 'Great Day,' he wrote 'Great Day,' yes.  It's called, what is it--'Zion's Walls,' 'Zion's Walls' is what it's called, not called 'Great Day.'  'I got a robe up in-a the kingdom' [sic, song title: 'Ain'a That Good News']  What's the other one I told you--
Speaker 1: You said the one that--shoot.  Did you--no you didn't mention 'My Lord What a Morning,' but--
Speaker 2: No, he might have a, a composition of that, but that's--there are several 'My Lords What a Morning.'
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: John Work [III] has one, Johnson has one.
Story_ID: 111934
Speaker 1: So what did--so you were a very responsible person, really from a young person, because everyone entrusted you.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: I mean you, I mean that, that's--and so out of that you had sort of--you got to learn more.  Now you said why--what did you learn--you learned how to direct, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, how to direct.
Speaker 1: And so that would be very important to you when you came back here, you know.  Now you asked--you got back here and in Chicago [Illinois] and had difficulty finding a job as a teacher.  Did that--
Speaker 2: Well I had a, I had a--there was a glitch in that.  And then Chicago Public Schools were not hiring black teachers, you know, as, as, as--
Speaker 1: Everyone was substitute.
Speaker 2: Substituting teachers, you know.  And so you had to take the exam.  And the exam most of the time people didn't pass the exam.  So you had a wide--big cadre of substitute teachers making twenty-five dollars a day.  I, first off didn't--had a hard time getting on because they did not want to honor the credits I had at Fisk University [Nashville, Tennessee] that would allow me to teach in Chicago Public Schools and I had to get registrar and Mr. Work to write them specific letters saying these classes were exactly what the Board of Education required to be able to get a substitute certificate.  I did take the exam and did pass the exam on a, on a review of the exam I did pass it and became a certified teacher.  I was the music director at a church called Grace Presbyterian Church right after I came here too.  So that was good.  The thing, the lessons I learned at--under--
Speaker 1: Who was the minister at Grace at that time?
Speaker 2: Edgar Ward, Edgar Ward.  He was a very, very fine man, very fine man, you know.  I, I've worked for some good, very good people, you know.  Young guy, fearless you know 'cause at that time the gangs were just beginning to come, come into fruition in that area right by the--right in the projects, actually in the middle of the projects at that time.  And they were trying to do a youth program there and the gangs kind of wanted to take it over.  And I saw him stand up.  He and his, his assistant, old woman, stand up to them and you know, stare them down.  You know so good, good people, you know, very good people.
Speaker 1: So you--how long did it take you to get on?
Speaker 2: At the Board [of Education]?
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: I mean this was--but this was totally rampant in, in Chicago Public School Systems.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: People were substitutes for years.
Speaker 2: Some people were substitutes for years.  What happened is I, I applied in the summer of 1959 and was rejected and had to go ahead and, and keep get--write--get these letters from Fisk to, to the Board of Education.  School starts the day after Labor Day and finally my stuff came in the week before Labor Day.  And they took until--they didn't want to--I guess they didn't want to pay me for that day, holiday after Labor Day, you get paid for it, you know.  Get paid for Labor Day as a substitute.  But--so they started me Wednesday following Labor Day.  I started my first day of teaching there.  And I substituted at Parker High School [Chicago, Illinois], and Englewood [High School, Chicago, Illinois].  I think I went to Englewood one day.  And then I went to the West Side to Beidler [Elementary School] and that, that's where I remained on the west side.  Worked at Beidler for four years.  And then from Beidler in '63 (1963) when I got back from South America with the John Work Chorale, went to Marshall [High School, Chicago, Illinois].
Story_ID: 111935
Speaker 1: Okay, now I want to talk about 1963.  So wait, 1963 is when you went to South America.  Now that was a very important trip because you went with the dancer--
Speaker 2: Alvin Ailey.
Speaker 1: Alvin Ailey.  And you had met him how?  He had heard you perform.
Speaker 2: There was a centennial celebration [A Century of Negro Progress Exposition] of the Negro--of the Emancipation--Emancipation Proclamation, and they had a, a--scheduled a--arranged to have a program, a week long or so program at the old McCormick Place.  And Duke Ellington was in town, Alvin Ailey was dancing on the stage at the program, at the--it was called 'My People.'  That's the name of the program, called 'My People.'  And summer of '63 [1963] they had--and the chorus from Chicago.  My choir [John Work Chorale], my choir had tried out to become the choir for that program, and we didn't get it.  Another choir got the, got the call to do that program.  And Alvin Ailey, his group at the [Alvin Ailey] American Dance Theater had gotten a contract to do a concert, concerts in Brazil.  And they of course were gonna go with the choir that was on set there with the Duke Ellington program, 'My People.'  But they--the people didn't wanna go.  They had to go work their job, you know and go back to school, teaching school.  Most of 'em teachers, subs, stuff like that.  And we just happened to have fought like tooth and nail to get a concert in McCormick Place at that time.  And we had one concert, do one concert there in the little theater.  And he came and heard us do that concert and hired us on the spot to go to South America with him.  And that's how we got to South America.  John Work Chorale.
Story_ID: 111936
Speaker 1: So now who--okay John Work Chorale though was formed at this point when?
Speaker 2: In 1960.
Speaker 1: In 1960, and so you were teaching at Bi--
Speaker 2: At Beidler [Elementary School] at the time, yes.
Speaker 1: At Beidler at the time.  Now who do you form the John Work Chorale with?  Who were the original members?
Speaker 2: The original members of John Work Chorale were members, former members of the Jubilee Singers and former members of Fisk University Choir.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And you--why--what was the motivation behind forming?
Speaker 2: The Chicago Alumni Association, Chicago Fisk Alumni Association, had their regional--there was a regional convention coming, Fisk alumni from all over the country, all the regional areas, Midwest, were gonna come to Chicago [Illinois] for our regional convention.  And they asked me could I get some--get some of the Jubilee Singers and choir members and have a choir.  At that time they would have a Friday, a Saturday and a Sunday morning worship service together at Park Manor Church.  I think it was Park Manor where they had the service 'cause that was a Fisk, Fisk hangout church for our Fiskites, former Fiskites.  And so called together these people together and we rehearsed a couple of weeks or so and for that Sunday morning we sang.  We provided music for that worship service.  And we liked the sound so well, you know it sound almost like the Jubilee Singers.  So we decided to stick together and continue to sing.  And we rehearsed for about maybe two or three months and then Theodore Charles Stone called me and asked me to--about if I can get a group together to sing for the regional, another regional convention for the National Association of Negro Musicians [NANM].  And had this group and so we sang, and at that time we didn't have a name.  I called Mr. [John] Work [III].  I wrote Mr. Work and he gave permission to use his name for the John Work Chorale, 'cause we loved his music, you know loved his harmonies.  And he gave us permission to use his name in spring of 1961.  Spring of 1961 we sang at the National Association of Negro Musicians' regional convention here in Chicago at--it was Bethesda--no it wasn't Bethesda.  At--forget the name of that church on State Street, a little church on State Street.  And the following year the national convention of negro musicians, Association of Negro Musicians, met in Chicago and they had a convention here, the national convention here and we sang at the KAM Temple for that convention, which is now [Rainbow] PUSH [Coalition], headquarters for PUSH.
Story_ID: 111937
Speaker 1: So was Lena McLin, was she active in that?  Who was active in the, the Association of Negro Music [National Association of Negro Musicians, NANM]--National--
Speaker 2: Theodore Charles Stone, Theodore Charles Stone was the head of that, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: He was the person that--as I said before when I first sang my first solo at Hartzell [Memorial United Methodist Church], he was the person that wrote me up in the [Chicago] Defender.  And to see my name in the Defender was something that really kind of sparked my whole, my whole interest in singing, you know, be able to do that as a young boy, fourteen years old to be able to see your name in the newspaper.
Story_ID: 111938
Speaker 1: So, so in many ways with the John Work Chorale, it was like old home week in many ways.  You know you had the central sense is, you know, is Fisk [University, Nashville, Tennessee].
Speaker 2: The initial, yeah.
Speaker 1: Or, you know, but you have the relationship with [William L.] Dawson [sic, relationship with John Work, III], so it's, you know, you know--you all sort of know each other.  Are there challenges that you didn't experience any other time with the formation of the group, you know or keeping the group together or--
Speaker 2: No, this group has been, as you know, well know now sixty--this is forty-eight years old or something, right, very fantastic, you know.  And we had one hiatus, and that was when I decided that just had enough of singing formally and wanted to sing like Oscar Brown and those other things.  And so in 1967, 1968 or something like that I said we were gonna go on vacation.  We're gonna take a summer vacation, and went on and did a--some theater work with different people and stuff like that.  But we came back together in '72 [1972] at the, at the urging of Jean [Harvey] Lightfoot who is the woman that--Jean Harvey who was the woman who brought me to Fisk in the first place.  She kept bugging me from 19--'bout 1969 to 1972.  When are you gonna call us back together?  When are you gonna--when is this vacation gonna be over?  And so finally we got back together in '72 [1972] and have been together since then.  Nobody gets paid.  We meet once a week.  We rehearse every week.  And give concerts all over.
Speaker 1: And I've attended one of those rehearsals and it's just the one--it's a wonderful feeling.  You--I mean it's wonderful.  The thing that I also want to ask.  In 1963, was the year that John Work died, right?
Speaker 2: Sixty-seven [1967] I think it was.
Speaker 1: Sixty-seven [1967].  I have it down--'67 [1967], okay.  My sources may be wrong, okay.  So he died in nine--okay, okay, so you had already done--see I was thinking all those things happened in '63 [1963].
Story_ID: 111939
Speaker 1: So '63 [1963] was really a highlight. Can you talk about Alvin Ailey?  The young Alv--you know, the Alvin Ailey that--
Speaker 2: The young Alvin was a fantastic, just a fantastic personality.  Just a tremendous talent, and had tremendously talented dancers with him.  The trip to Eur--I mean to, to South America was a challenge for me because his dance troupe had been used to dancing with a tape.  The--what they call 'Revelations' is the music is taped.  And they had--their bodies are timed.  So between each one of those numbers are X amount of seconds, and their bodies are timed so that boom, boom, boom, boom, and they're ready for the next dance.  And of course we have a live group performing for 'Revelations,' it's very difficult to do that because you have to have pitch and you can't, you know, just can't start a song five seconds or ten seconds after the previous song.  You can't just start a song, boom, by that time.  And that was a very difficult thing.  So he--we had a, we had differences, you know, because we just could not fulfill that what he wanted at the time.  We did it a couple of times down there.  But he was just a fantastic musician.  You know we didn't--after doing a couple of attempts at doing the, doing the 'Revelation,' he ultimately went back to tape and we did a portion of the concert down there.
Speaker 1: So was Judith Jamison dancing 'Revelations'?
Speaker 2: No, no, she wasn't there then.
Speaker 1: She wasn't there.
Speaker 2: That was before her.
Speaker 1: That's amazing, okay.
Speaker 2: She wasn't there then.
Speaker 1: You always think of her, you know with that, that--
Speaker 2: Right, she came after that, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And how long was that tour there in South--
Speaker 2: We, we went--we were two weeks in South America.
Speaker 1: Where in South America?
Speaker 2: Brazil, Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paolo.
Speaker 1: Okay that was--did you get around?  Did you get up to Bahia [Brazil] and places like that?
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: No just, okay.
Speaker 2: Just those two places, yeah, right--
Story_ID: 111940
Speaker 1: So now what year do you get on with--you said John--when you went to Marshall High School [Chicago, Illinois] was 19--
Speaker 2: Sixty-three [1963].
Speaker 1: Sixty-three [1963], so you--so that's what I was saying.  Okay, so I thought he had passed.  So you're, you, you start with Marshall, but at the same time you do this tour.  So is the tour during the summer?
Speaker 2: No the--actually the tour was a result of--Marshall was a result of the tour.  I was teaching at Beidler [Elementary School] up until '63 [1963].  When the tour came up, I went to the Board of Education, 'cause I was a substitute.  And I asked them could I--I told them I had to go to a tour, I was gonna do a tour in September, gonna go to South America.  They said well you can't do that.  If you go to South America, you're gonna have to resign.  So I had to resign from the Board of Education and went to South America.  When I came back, I went--now I didn't go to the Board directly, I went to my district superintendent, had a district superintendent and music supervisor.  I went to them and she greased the wheels for me to come back into the board sys--into the system.  And they needed a teacher at Manley, it was upper grade center at that time.  And when I came back in the system, they sent me to Manley.  She asked me what did I want to do.  I said well I like teaching high school.  So I was teaching at Beidler.  And I said I'd like to teach in high school.  So they said well we'll put you over here in Manley for a while until we get a position for you at Marshall.  And so they created a position for me at Marshall while I taught at Beidler, I mean at, at Manley.
Speaker 1: So now when you were at Beidler, were you teaching music?
Speaker 2: I came to Beidler in 1959, my third, fourth day of teaching in the public school system.  And I was a substitute, I was sent there, you know, as a substitute on that following Monday after Labor Day.  And the principal set me down in his office and says Mr. O'Banion you're at, you're at the draft age.  I said yes.  He said would you like to get a draft deferment?  I said yes.  He said well we have a job here teaching EMH [educable mentally handicapped] and if you agree to take that job, we'll get you a deferment.  And so I said okay, cool, you know.  And I--but I didn't know what EMH was at the time, but it was easier--it would supposedly be students who were educable, mentally handicapped, okay.  But my experience there, they were not educable--they were not handicapped at all, they were just kids who had not been taught, who had not had--there were a couple of them there who had some neurological problems.  But most of them were just kids who hadn't, had been problems in classrooms, they threw them in, threw them in this junk heap to keep them out of the other classes, other--way of the other teachers.  So I inherited this class and it was rough going for the first six months, but I ultimately was able to settle them down and to teach.  And out of that class I think probably the first graduates of, of a grammar school EMH classroom came out of my class.  And it's probably in the history of Chicago.  I don't think anybody else has done that.
Speaker 1: So you were teaching regular.  You weren't teaching music at all.
Speaker 2: That first, first year and a half.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The second year, second year one of the schools, grammar schools on the South Side inquired, wanted me to come over there to teach band because I had a degree in, in instrumental music.  So they wanted me to teach band and this woman didn't want me to leave.  So she, she offered me--you can teach drum and bugle corps here [Beidler Elementary School] and we'll give you this and you can do that and you'll be our--what do you call it, audio/visual coordinator.  And so for the next two years I was audio/visual coordinator for the school.  That meant I went around and did the, you know, cameras and stuff like that, and ordered film for classroom teachers and I substituted whenever they had--and that, those two years were very good because I got a chance to see what the other classes were.  I taught from grammar school--from kindergarten all the way up to eighth grade kids, you know.  And that was my real exposure to education, those two years.
Speaker 1: But what is interesting is that you're known for your, you know, you have a great reputation with Marshall, you know as the, the, I want to say the band director.  Is that right, band?
Speaker 2: Band director, music teacher, music, yes ma'am.
Speaker 1: So when you went over, you got this job at Marshall, what was the Marshall--who was the principal?  What, what shape was Marshall?  What shape was the student body?
Story_ID: 110574
Speaker 1: So talk about Marshall.  Just re- you know 'cause you were saying when you came (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) When I came to Marshall, they brought me there to sing--to organize, organize a boys chorus.  I was blessed because I had a chorus, I had an eighth grade chorus at, at Beidler [Elementary School], and those kids who came from Beidler to Marshall were the cou- were the gen- were the heart of my chorus at, at Marshall.  So the guys who came there, they became the chorus at Marshall.  So in the first year there we had about twenty-seven guys who--some kids who came into the chorus that were, weren't from Beidler.  And won the competition, took a superior rating the first superior rating of a black choir out of Marshall in its history.  So we took a superior rating that year and continued on the next couple of years, and then I finally went to be a human relations coordinator.  But Marshall at that time had, when I came there it had five thousand students in it.  That's the population of Marshall.  It was almost on the d- I think it was two, two, two double period day, yeah.
Speaker 1: Can we talk about were you--how did the students that you were dealing with differ from the students you went to school with, or the student that you were?  Did you find things had changed much in that sort of--more, more like twenty-five year period, you know.
Speaker 2: Not really, not really.
Speaker 1: No, not really.
Speaker 2: Because even today, you know, you got all kinds of crap going on in the public school system, but that's primarily because of the adults.  The adults have abdicated their authority, they have abdicated their ability to teach.  And so the kids are gonna respond.  There's a vacuum there, so kids responding to that vacuum.  In my classroom, in my situation at Marshall High School [Chicago, Illinois], there was never a vacuum, you know.  I taught boys chorus.  We would--the first boys chorus, they gave me a room up in the, in the attic of the school first, when I first came there.  It was a classroom that didn't have a door out to the hallway.  You had to go through either the orchestra room or the music room next door.  It was a room between two rooms.  It had one incandescent bulb in the ceiling and a, and a attic window about twelve feet off the floor at the front of the room, okay, and I had a portable, a portable blackboard in that room.  And that's where the boys--piano, they rolled a piano in there for me.  So that's where the boys chorus was found, founded in that room.  But--and these guys were--some of them were Vice Lords, some of 'em were Cobras at the time, Vice Lords and Cobras.  But every morning at 7:30 we met together and there was no gang, there was no, you know, at least I didn't find out these gang members, some of 'em were gang members, until long after they're, after I had left, they had left.  And (unclear) talking to guys who came back and said, "Well you know (Unclear), he was such-and-such a--.  So-and-so, he was a so and so and so," but when they came together, we sang together.  And that was, you know the way it was.  And then when I taught general music, I had no problems, really no problems because I--old school teacher.  Not vicious or anything like that, but just put what, what I needed to put out there in front of the kids and they responded to that, and there were other teachers like that all through Marshall at that time.  The teachers who were really concerned and cared about the kids and weren't a- weren't afraid of them.  You know I think a lot of the thing now is that we're running into is fear, you know.
Speaker 1: But see you had a forty-year career over at Marshall, right? You were, forty (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Forty, forty-one and a half, forty-two years.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Story_ID: 110575
Speaker 1: And what I'm wondering, you know because I remember you know when we were talking about mentors and you were saying that, you know that term wasn't what you thought of.  But I couldn't help think of you and Marshall [High School, Chicago, Illinois] and this may--you can tell me if it's a good analogy or not.  But I couldn't help think of you and Mr. Campbell, and maybe that's analogy or not.  Mainly because he was working with, you know, a--
Speaker 2: Youth.
Speaker 1: Youth and a choir.  And you were saying how he was responsible for all these careers and mentoring.  And really not only you built Marshall to be an outstanding choir--it wasn't an outstanding choir before you got there, right?
Speaker 2: Well the boys chorus, it didn't exist.
Speaker 1: Right, it didn't exist--okay, that's, okay.
Speaker 2: And then I took over band.  You know and that, that--the band of course became an outstanding band while I was there.
Speaker 1: So that's what I, I want to talk--'cause I don't think this is a conversation about years, but I want to know how you did that and, and who you have mentored along the way.  You know, but how you actually did that.  Because the school as you pointed out, didn't have a lot of resources for that.  So I'm just trying to--I mean was--because you're just like, you know I went to teach, you know.
Speaker 2: But no, but you see I'm a composite.  I'm a composite of Mr. Campbell, Mr. [John] Work [III], Mr. Dawson--Dr. [William L.] Dawson, Mr. [Earl] Madison.  I'm a composite.  And all these guys were great teachers and great--well if you're in terms of what we're talking about now, mentors.  You know, they didn't let you slip.  If you, if you made a mistake, they didn't chastise you and castrate you or put you to the side because you made a mistake.  They were people who encouraged and continued to, to promote you as a person, you know.  And in teach--in terms of teaching, that's what I did.  That's, that's just basically I was a composite of all those guys in terms of my teaching experience.  I knew that--and say in the band or in the, in the chorale experience at Marshall that there was a certain amount of discipline these kids had to have in order to be able to be successful, you know.
Story_ID: 110576
Speaker 1: So what did you do?  How did you go about discipline?
Speaker 2: I just stuck to the guns.  I just stuck to the guns.  You can't, you can't do it any other way.  When I took over the band at Marshall High School [Chicago, Illinois]--
Speaker 1: Now who was the band director before you?
Speaker 2: It was a guy, I won't even mention his name because the band was such, in such pitiful shape.  And when I took it over, it was--I think I had at least--only five kids could read music.  The rest of them were--been, been trained to--by rote, you know.  They--here's the finger and charts up here on the board and you, you put this finger down and play and that's the kind of stuff.  So it was a rough, it was a real rough time.  I took them over because they were going to Grambling [State University, Grambling, Louisiana] for a band camp.  And the band director had been called out to go to another school and the principal came to me and said I didn't--I don't have anybody to go with them.  So I, I volunteered.  I didn't intend to be the band director.  I volunteered to be--accompany them down to Grambling in Louisiana, which I did, which probably the worst two weeks in my entire life 'cause these kids were just as wild as they could be.  And when they came back, I got stuck with it.  Nobody wanted to come there to teach.  And I just, you know, recalled my band experience at, at Phillips [High School, Chicago, Illinois] 'cause I didn't have any band at Marshall, I mean at Fisk [University, Nashville, Tennessee].  So I recalled what [Earl] Madison had taught me and I started teaching the same, same way he taught me, taught the other kids at Mar--at, at Phillips.  And over a period of maybe four or five years, the band began to, you know, began to gel, marching band, concert band, jazz band, and the whole works, beginner's bands.  And for fifteen years I did that, you know.
Speaker 1: So you were competing, you would have competitions, right?  And wouldn't Marshall place at the top?
Speaker 2: Well Marshall always got--well we had two years we got superior ratings.  In 1982 and 1983.  The rest of those years we got excellent ratings, except for the first year, we got a good rating the first year.  That was when they were--when I was building the band.  Just came and took over the band, we got a good rating, which was not bad, you know, for what I had.  My number one trumpet player called, father called me and told me she, she couldn't come because she had to watch the house, you know, 'cause everybody gone be gone from the house--leave his house unprotected.  I had my trombone player punked out on me at the--when we were getting ready to rehearse, you know, for her to go on the stage.  He was sitting over in the corner daydreaming and I told him he can't play, you know.  You weren't with the rest of the kids, you can't play.  He ultimately joined, stayed with the band, but I wouldn't let him play that day, you know.  But after that first year we got excellent ratings, excellent ratings, excellent ratings.  And up until '82 [1982], we played the finale to the 'New World Symphony,' which is quite a diff--the same notes that the Chicago Symphony Orchestra played, my band played on music--on wind instruments.  Then they got superior rating for that.  That's one of the three compositions they played.  And the following year they played '[The] Universal Judgment,' which is supposed to be the worst, most complicated of compositions that a band could play, and they played and got a superior rating on that, you know.
Speaker 1: So just tell me how does it work within a school, you know, in the music departments?  Like was music--during this period of time, were there things being taken away from the schools in terms of music, or the arts?  You know, or did you see that after the '80s [1980s]?
Speaker 2: No.  Once I started building my program, it's a really weird thing.  I would go to band directors' meetings and the guys be talking about how they were being, you know, being short changed and money was not coming to the departments.  But during that period of time, I was getting, you know, everything that was coming, everything I asked for, I got.  You know, money and everything.  Now what happened at one point when they changed principals, you know Marshall [High School, Chicago, Illinois] was under that thing where they removed a principal [Steve Newton] because of the bathroom supposedly thing, it was big news and stuff.  And they placed an interim principal who ultimately became principal of the school.  What they did then, they froze all budgets.  My budget at that time was over $20,000.  And if I put in the--I was gonna do the auditorium--I did do the auditorium sound system.  It was about $35,000 I had to spend.  And I lost all of that because they--when the interim of changing principals, they froze the budget and put the budget under control of the Chicago Public Schools.  And so my money never came.  That year was the first year I lost anything.
Speaker 1: Now what year was that?
Speaker 2: That was 19--'bout 1987, '88 [1988], something like that.
Speaker 1: Okay so that--okay, okay, okay.  Now but the money never came back, or it came back?
Speaker 2: No, when the new principal came in, of course he had diff--had differences with me initially.  But ultimately he became--we became, you know comrades and he supported my program.  It was a very valuable program.
Speaker 1: Well it was probably--would you say your program was the best program in the school in terms of program--
Speaker 2: I would--you know I wouldn't go so far as to say all that because you had to--we, we worked in conjunction with the phys ed [physical education] department and there were--the history department was doing quite a few good things.  There were departments that were doing things.  You had teachers who were teaching.  So you had, you know, basically Marshall came back for, from zero ground to one of the competing schools in the city during that period of time.
Speaker 1: But Marshall had a good--was it a basketball team?
Speaker 2: Excellent basketball team.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They won in 1958 and 1959, I think 1960, and then they won again the 50th anniversary of that, they won the state championship this year.
Story_ID: 110577
Speaker 1: So, so what are you--you had--what are the other things you're involved in?  You're definitely involved in the John Work Chorale during this period, you know, that except for your hiatus.  Have you--and you said you had done some theatrical things or you know.  But--and what were those?
Speaker 2: Well I did 'Blues for Mister Charlie.'  I did the father--'Blues for Mr. Charlie' for the, for a theater on the South Side [of Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Kuumba Theater?
Speaker 2: No it wasn't Kuumba, it was another theater.
Speaker 1: Was it eta?
Speaker 2: No, it was a theater before that.  It was a theater at--it was the Hull House Theater.  Hull House owned a theater--was part of the theater at 67th and I think it's Vernon or something like that.  Little theater there on the corner.  They, they had it then.  I did that, and I did 'Ollie Ben Ollie' [ph.] and '[The] Desert Song' for Hull House.  I was doing a lot of Hull House stuff at that time around the city.  I did Chamber Theater for Hull House, where we'd go out to homes and read, you know, read the, read script without actual action and stuff like that.  So I was doing that and just 'Show Boat' for the Athenaeum Theatre, at the Athenaeum Theater, did (unclear) for the Athenaeum Theater.  I did another thing on the--only showboat we did have here in the city.  You know they had a showboat [Showboat Sari S] here right off of Ontario and, and Chicago River, at a point.  And I did a thing, a showboat there.  That was for the Salon Company, which was, was a trucking company had brought a showboat and parked it on the river and they had nightly shows there.  I did that for about a summer.
Story_ID: 110578
Speaker 1: Let me ask this question.  So in the--tell me what you think in terms of the preservation of you know spirituals, the Negro spirituals and where you think things are headed now.  Now in your--with, with the--let's say with the music department at Marshall.  What--were you teaching the whole range of music there, or was there a focus?
Speaker 2: Well in the music department, I started with boys chorus and I had the, the general music classes of course, which were, you know, basically going from nuts and bolts in terms of all, all the music that's being--that was out there, classical period up to modern period music.  And that was just for those few years that I first taught--start, started teaching.  Then when--as a human relations coordinator, I didn't teach anything.  I did that for six years, human relations coordinator.  Didn't teach anything, I had to--that's a lot of my mentoring went into too because I had students who were--where I was able to interact with as a human relations coordinator and their families, etc.  Then I came back and after I went to the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois] for a master's degree.  Went to work on my master's for two years.
Speaker 1: And that was what year?
Speaker 2: Seventy [1970] through '72 [1972].
Speaker 1: And why did you decide to do that?
Speaker 2: Well I thought I was gonna be a psychologist.  I, I was in, in therapy--
Speaker 1: Why--what--
Speaker 2: I was in therapy for a couple of years.  I was having--
Speaker 1: Now why did--why did you decide to go into therapy?
Speaker 2: I was having some problems that I, I wanted to solve for myself.  Some things that I really needed to understand for myself and I went to group therapy.  And the guy who was over the group offered me a scholarship to his institute.  And so I was only two years into, into, into, in the, in the therapy sessions.  And the second year I was at his institute studying with him. And--
Speaker 1: And what institute was this?
Speaker 2: Postal Institute, Postal [ph.].
Speaker 1: It's part of the University of Chicago?
Speaker 2: No, no, this is a private institute.
Speaker 1: This is, is this similar to Adler [Adlerian psychology]?
Speaker 2: He was an Adler, he was an Adler--a, a student of [Alfred] Adler, Adler thing, but he had his own institute down on Michigan Avenue.  And he offered me a scholarship and I studied with him for a year.  And during that period of time, there were these scholarships that were available at the University of Chicago in psychology.  And so I applied, went out, interviewed for it, and got the scholarship, two-year scholarship in social psychological specialist, as a social psychological specialist.  So I left Marshall in '72 [1972] and came back in '73 [1973], seventy--left Marshall in '70 [1970], came back in '72 [1972] and started all over at Marshall as a, as a music teacher, then a choral teacher.  And during that period--
Speaker 1: So during that time, music wasn't in your life.  Isn't it the time that you also had taken a break from the John Work Chorale?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was during that period of time.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, during that time.  I, I--music was always there because when I was, when I was going to these institutes for the psychological, social psychological specialist, all I could hear was music in my head.  That's what prompted me to go back into music, you know.  'Cause I'd be sitting up in a seminar and I had to get up and go to the bathroom and record a tune into my tape recorder and come back and sit down and get up and go again and do all kinds of--I mean it was really--I couldn't get away from music; that was the whole thing.  I couldn't get away from it.  So I decided that I'd go back in the, in the school system 'cause there I had a laboratory, I could do what I wanted to do, basically.  And I could expand my base of, of knowledge.
Story_ID: 110579
Speaker 1: And so I went back to Marshall [High School, Chicago, Illinois] and I started as a choral director, I mean as a general music teacher and a choral director.  And then in 1994, I inherited the band, you know got the band and went on to 1990 with the band.
Speaker 2: And which--did the band win more awards than the choral group, or was it--
Speaker 1: Well I think they would be equally, equally spaced, you know.  'Cause the choral group, when I came to Marshall High School, the band, band when I first came to Marshall High, the band had a guy there, Bob Hirsch had a superior rated band.  Every year they went and took a superior rating, you know.  But I guess they fell so far off the chart when I came over, I had to build them back up to that point.  But they were--I mean the band concerts at Marshall High School were like going downtown to hear the symphony orchestra; they were just that good.
Story_ID: 110580
Speaker 1: And did you, did you ever come across your, you know, forty-one, forty-two years teaching a Delano O'Banion?
Speaker 2: Did I ever come across a Delano O'Banion in my teaching?  Many of them, many of them.  I remember guys, there are guys out there right now--one of the guys I just called recently.  He's a preacher, Clarence Thomas.  I'm gone try to get him--trying to get him to be our Men's Day speaker at our church.  He's a former Marshall [High School, Chicago, Illinois] student who was one of my mentees when I was human relations coordinator.  You know, during that, it was during that period of, of the Civil Rights Movement and he was deeply involved in the Civil Rights Movement.  And of course people at that time didn't understand anything about us.  When the [Black] Panthers were, you know, running, were running things and so those kids who were, who were in that, in that group, they somehow they wound up being shepherded by me at the school level, just keep 'em in school.  He ultimately went on to get his degree from Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia].  And now he's a--runs a program, his own program for youth development.  So we got--(unclear) guys are musicians around the country that are just doing fantastic things.
Story_ID: 110581
Speaker 1: Now you know it's funny to hear you say, you know, you had to go in and record the music that you realized that it was just a part of you.  So can we talk about the psychological part?  You know how it makes you feel, you know, when you're singing?  Or around it.  I mean--
Speaker 2: Well, at one point in my life it was, you know, almost spiritual.  You know I could sing and get chills, you know with myself in terms of what I was doing, what God has given me the ability to do singing-wise.  And that was really a great thrill.  Now not so much anymore because I get that thrill from conducting, from hearing the music and all those other things.  But it's really a gift that, you know a special gift I believe because it has enabled me to be who I am and where I am right now in terms of music.  My interpretation, my feeling for it, my passion for it, the ethos that I feel when I'm singing is all translated and that's what people feel, you know, that's what you transmit as you're, as you're singing.  Everybody can't do that.  So music has been a integral part of my growth, integral part of my salvation.  You know 'cause when--during the period of my time when I was most down at my lowest, I was always able to hum a tune and bring myself back up.
Speaker 1: So can you describe how you feel when it gave you goose bumps?  Or can you describe how you feel when you feel you've connected with the audience?  Can you describe that?
Speaker 2: Only thing I can say is goose bumps, you know.  And you know if you connect with the audience.  Sometimes you connect, sometimes you don't.  But my younger days, I felt that I always did, you know, 'cause that was just the way it was for me.  I just never--I had my voice was much more powerful, or much more intricately involved with my spirit than it is now.  You know I've sung myself, you know to smithereens.  Singing with the choir, you sing soprano, alto, tenor, bass, and that kind of has a deterior--deterior--
Speaker 1: On the vocal--
Speaker 2: On the vocal chords.  But I'm able to sing over that to a great extent, but I don't feel that I do as much as I did when I was younger, you know.  I mean just now I told a guy at Sunday after I sang a solo Sunday, I said it was really technique, you know.  It's really just learning, you know, the technique I learned from [F.] Bertram Briess that carries me on now.
Story_ID: 110582
Speaker 1: Now that's interesting that Ber [F. Bertram Briess]--it was a semester.  But what did he teach you that, that you're, you know you're talking about?  'Cause it was just a semester that you had exposure to him.  And you said he was a German, okay.
Speaker 2: He was a bass, he was a basso.  He had a fantastically low, booming bass voice.  And the funny thing, I had just left Madame [Elsa Harthan] Arendt who told me when I--'fore I left Chicago [Illinois] to go to college.  Don't let these people ruin your voice.  So when I got down to Fisk [University, Nashville, Tennessee], I, you know I challenged him.  You know, what are you gonna do for me?  How are you gonna do--what can you do?  Blah, blah, blah.  And he finally said well Mr. O'Banion I don't think I, I can be your teacher.  And after he said that, then I settled down, you know and began to, you know, become a, a pupil.  And he told me how to--the higher I sang and to be--how to open up so I could sing high.  And the higher I sang, the lower my voice became.  So that was a technique that he gave me that was just unbe--just the opening up and the whole thing that--I can't explain it.  It's just when I, I can teach it.  I can teach it, but I can't explain it.  But--
Speaker 1: So you're saying if I sing high, if a person sings higher, that they will have a lower range.
Speaker 2: My range became higher.
Speaker 1: Are you saying that was you, or that's, that's a technique?
Speaker 2: That was me.  I--it's a technique.  I can, I can give a technique, you know, if you're susceptible to that technique, I can give it to you.  But as a teacher, you know, I can give it to you.  But it was something that he did that, that you know just kind of explain.  As he sang it, he--as he did it, he kind of opened it up for me.  So my voice instead of having a G to a D range, my voice came to a, a, A and a C range.
Speaker 1: Is that different from singing over the voice?  Singing over--that's a different thing, right?
Speaker 2: Singing--
Speaker 1: Singing over.  When you said I've learned how to sing over--
Speaker 2: Sing over that, over the complications that might occur, you know, as a result of strain and all that kind of stuff.  If you have a cold, you know sometimes singers have a cold and they have a concert.  The have to learn how to sing over that cold.  And that's something I learned to do.
Story_ID: 110583
Speaker 1: So let me ask you what is one of your favorite songs still today?
Speaker 2: Probably the 'Messiah.'  Probably that's one of the few things--I mean there are four songs in the Mess--four bass songs in the 'Messiah.'
Speaker 1: I was gonna have you sing something that was--
Speaker 2: Not 'Old Man River.'
Speaker 1: Not 'Old Man River' today? I was gonna have you--you're giving choral songs.  I'm thinking I can get a solo out of you.
Speaker 2: Solos in the 'Messiah,' bass solos in the 'Messiah.'
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: Those are, those are songs that I think that are most intricate and most involved and actually gave me a lot of, you know, the, the ability to be able to do--the flexibility to be able to do what I did after, after singing the 'Messiah' as a youngster.
Speaker 1: Are you up to singing a few bars?
Speaker 2: I can, I can attempt to, you know.
Speaker 1: Good.
Speaker 2: I can sing the--I'll start with the recitative to the first song.  'Thus Saith The Lord.'  (Singing).  "Thus saith the Lord, the Lord of hosts.  Yet once a little while and I will shake the hands and the earth, the sea and the dry land."  Now I'm singing over all that phlegm and stuff in my throat.
Speaker 1: Doesn't sound like you're singing over.
Speaker 2: That's technique, believe me.  Technique.  I can feel it, but I, you know my mind says do this and do that, you know and that's the way you do it.
Story_ID: 110584
Speaker 1: Now let me ask you--you, when you look back I want to say look back on your career because in one aspect of things, it's a career that did not reach the potential you wanted to reach, meaning that you would have wanted a career on the stage.  But it's also a career that has affected a lot of lives, and has been affected by lives.  What would you say--first of all, how would you recap your career?  And I'm gonna ask you a couple more questions.
Speaker 2: Well I would--I guess the basic thing I would say would be very satisfying.  I didn't intend to go in the direction I went.  I met my wife [Bonita O'Banion] at Fisk [University, Nashville, Tennessee] in my senior year, you know I'd gotten away clean, scot free for four years, four and a half years 'cause I was a year from made up for, for the year that I was in Europe, for the semester I was in Europe.  So it winds up four and a half.  I actually spent four years at Fisk, but because I came in January of 1955 and went through '59 [1959], that's four and a half years.  But my senior year I met my wife.  And then the year after I graduated, so we got married.  And of course that's, that's a whole new thing, situation, had a kid.  And you know--
Speaker 1: Your child's name?
Speaker 2: The first child died of crib death.  The first child was Deon, and he died two weeks after.  But then we had a, you know we had the problem of all the problems that go with that kind of thing.  And so we kind of hung in there and we had the second child, who is Dana [Keone], who's forty-two now, forty-two years old.  But then you got babies, then you have to find--make sure that you have a job.  And so the teaching thing became, you know, the primary thing.  And I enjoy teaching, I really do, really enjoyed it tremendously.  I enjoyed it, the four years I had at Beidler [Elementary School] because I saw kids grow.  That's one of the things about teaching.  In, in my years at Beidler I had this EMH [educable mentally handicapped] classroom and I had the same kids every year just about, a few of 'em fell off at the end of the one year and then a few more come in.  But you get a chance to see them grow, you know, in the four years.  And I saw kids who were reading at a first grade level when I first took over and reading at a fourth or fifth grade level by the time the second or third year rolled around.  And at fourth grade they could go--they could graduate.  If they read at a fourth grade level at that point.  And I graduated about, maybe about four or five kids out of that, out of that class.  Normally they don't ever graduate.  They go from, from Beidler to continuation school or--and then they drop out, you know.  But was able to get some kids into Marshall High School [Chicago, Illinois] from that experience.  And then go to Marshall and have boys chorus at, you know that sang.  We were in demand all over.  I had a chorus there, also the Madrigals which were patterned after the Jubilee Singers.  And that group toured the city.  You know we did concerts, explaining the Negro spiritual as we went along.  And there we had narrators that did that, and then we had--then I had Theater-in-the-Streets.  So I had a varied career.  Theater-in-the-Streets--we're the first school, the first theater--first successful outdoor theater in the country.  'Cause they'd had it several other places, but they were having riots and things like that 'cause during the long, hot summer of 1967.  But we went on the streets with all the riots and things, right after the, the riots and we were able to capture audiences and entertain audiences and never have fights or battles or anything of that kind during that period of time.
Speaker 1: You were at--you just started at Marshall, or that was when you were at Beidler?
Speaker 2: No, I was at Ma--at Marshall.  I started Marshall in '63 [1963], this was '67 [1967] when--
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: When Theater-in-the-Streets was a program that the, the faculty of Marshall and the district office wrote the proposal for and the federal government approved it.  And so they wound up in this--'course it was the summer, long, hot summer of '67 [1967].  No one wanted to take--the people who were supposed to take charge of it didn't take charge of it.  And they reached back and asked me would I do it, and we did it.  And it was very successful.  Then I went away to school, University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois], came back and taught at Marshall again.  And for the next--from '74 [1974] through to 2005, excellent career.
Story_ID: 110585
Speaker 1: What would you like to do that you haven't done in your life?
Speaker 2: Travel the world.  I'd like to go to Africa.  I'd like to go China, Japan, Asia.  That's the only thing I would like to do right now.
Story_ID: 110586
Speaker 1: And what would you want your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: That I tried.  I did as much as I could pre--preserve the culture of our people.  Particularly the Negro spiritual.
Story_ID: 110587
Speaker 1: Why is it important, the preservation of Negro spirituals?
Speaker 2: Well it starts back actually I go back to Hartzell [Memorial United Methodist Church, Chicago, Illinois].  You know, when I was singing in the choir.  Didn't really have a, an understanding of-"I got robe up in-a that kingdom," all of those songs.  'Ain't-a that good news?'  We sang 'em, you know, just sang 'em.  They were just Negro spirituals and we sang 'em.  When I was at, at, at Sherwood [Music School, Chicago, Illinois], my teacher [Elsa Harthan Arendt] who was Viennese white, wanted me, every time we had a recital, wanted me to sing a Negro spiritual during the recital.  I'd be the only black on the program and I would have to sing a Negro spiritual most of the time.  Went to Fisk [University, Nashville, Tennessee] and didn't really have a, a grasp of the Jubilee Singers, etc., all that kind of stuff.  Singing Negro spirituals, John Work [III] works, you know.  But I went to Europe and we had three concerts that we could--they could choose from.  One had art songs, one had the songs from the classical period, the baroque period, and the other was primarily all Negro spirituals.  And each one of those countries, each one of those people who chose the songs, chose the, chose the, the program with all Negro spirituals.  And those songs got just tremendous response from the Europeans.  I mean it was like I said before, standing ovations, raves, you know, four, five, six encores at a time.  You know at concert after concert, you know.  And it began to dawn on me, wait, this is something.  This is really something.  The people worldwide and half the words they wouldn't understand because we were singing in English and they spoke German or French or Italian or Portuguese or where we did all those countries.  And they didn't understand it, but they felt the pathos, and that's what they were responding to.  They didn't have to understand the words.  They felt the pathos.  And so coming back to Chi--I mean coming back to Nashville, I began to, you know, appreciate greater, the greater experience of the Negro spiritual. But also being on Fisk campus, there was just so much going on there.  It was an art department, Aaron Douglas, who was from the Harlem Renaissance also, was the head of the art department, which was on the first floor of the dormitory that I lived in; his studio was.  And the classrooms were, so I got a chance to--every time I'd leave the--leave my, my dormitory room I could go through the art, art department and see all this art.  So I was surrounded by this culture.  And during the Fisk days at, at Marshall [High School, Chicago, Illinois], I left Fisk and went to Marshall, first at Beidler [Elementary School].  I taught Negro spirituals at Beidler with the seventh and eighth grade chorus when the woman offered me the opportunity to keep me there to teach music, I taught that.  And went to Marshall.  I taught boys chorus, I had Negro spiritual, Negro music there.  'I lost my Appetite for Chicken' was a Work song.  Then at Hartzell, at, at, at Grace Church, Negro spiri--in fact, I force fed spirituals to the people at Grace 'cause they were basically one of those Presbyterian churches and they didn't do Negro spirituals.  A black church, but they didn't do Negro spirituals.  I force fed them Negro spirituals.  And the John Work Chorale of course at that time was doing Negro spirituals.  But really what dawns on you when you think about it is the whole Civil Rights Movement, the songs they sang during the Civil Rights Movement are all spirituals.  'Ain't Gone Let Nobody Turn you Around,' 'We Shall Overcome.'  All the songs that inspired and kept that movement moving.  It, it rode on the songs of the Civil Rights Movement, the songs--Civil Rights Movement rode on the songs along with [Reverend Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.], that's what they did.  They just sang those Negro spirituals.  I think that why Negro spirituals, 'cause they're such a--they touch all genres of music, first off.  But they also touch people all over the globe.  If we went to Europe, if we went to South America, if we went to, we went--in South America we got--the John Work Chorale got--I hate to say more ovations than the Alvin Ailey [American] Dance Theater, which cut back our, our exposure 'cause after that first concert, we weren't allowed to sing a full, you know, four or five, six, four or five song selection.  We were cut back to one or two songs in the concert.  But all over, wherever we've been, we've--it's, it's, it's--they grab the people.  Europeans, I've never been to Africa, so I'd love to go to Africa and see how it plays.  I'd love to go to, to Asia, to Japan, to, to various places on earth to see how they--I believe it's a univ--I believe that Negro spirituals are universal in their concept and universal in their touch.  The pathos of those songs would touch any people.  And I saw it in Europe and in South America.
