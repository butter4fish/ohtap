Story_ID: 226199
Speaker 1: I want to ask you about your family.  I want to ask you about your mother's side of the family and your father's [Stewart Dine Jackson] side and we'll start with your mother's side.  Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Norma, N-O-R-M-A, Marie, M-A-R-I-E, Freeney, F-R-E-E-N-E-Y.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Her date of birth is February 22nd, I don't know exactly what year.  I believe in the 1920s.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Nineteen thirties [1930s], and she was born in Chicago, Illinois.
Speaker 1: Okay, now what do you know about your ancestors on her side of the family?  How far back can you trace them?
Speaker 2: We lived with her mother [Ella Freeney] and her father [Dock Freeney], I lived with her mother and her father, as well as she and all of my sisters and brothers, my sisters, I don't have any brothers, and so by living with my grandparents who were in their seventies, eighties and nineties, we got to learn a lot about their parents and about their grandparents.  So, while I can't trace back the total lineage, I can tell stories about my great-grandparents and my great-great-grandparents that were told to me.
Speaker 1: Okay, well tell us, you know, some of the stories that you know.  What, what are some of the stories?
Speaker 2: Well, I, I know a lot about when slavery ended and how black people were and what the relationships were, in the South, this is in Georgia, between blacks and whites in Georgia.  And, in fact, I was actually taught many of those customs on 43rd Street in Chicago from my grandparents.  They taught me what I should be as a young black man as they had learned from their fathers and mothers and their grandfathers and mothers.  They taught me that I needed to have a kind of fear and a kind of, more fear than respect for white people and I never really understood why until I read a lot about history and I actually started going down South and seeing.  I, I grew up on 43rd Street for the most part where there were very few white people and I just couldn't understand why, why my grandfather, in a sense, was so afraid of, of the few whites that we came in contact with but as I went back in history, I found out that he actually had to leave Leesburg, Georgia, which was his hometown, at midnight because the Ku Klux Klan [KKK] was lynching black people and, but by the grace of God that he got away.  And so, forevermore, his, his worldview had been changed and, and he sought many times to impart onto me that same worldview and so that's one of the stories.
Speaker 1: Now, now did he have a story about specifically what had happened to him, you know, in Leesburg?  Were they coming after him for a specific reason?
Speaker 2: No, no, it was one of the nights that they were just going after black people and they, apparently there were many of these nights but they had, he and my grandmother told me about other black men who weren't as lucky and who were killed and who were hanged.  So, so they, they told me those stories and, you know, I couldn't really, you know, I couldn't feel it.  I couldn't get with it, you know, and I said, you know, it's not like that, I said, and much of their teaching reflected that it was like that.  And so there was always this kind of apprehension and this fear in any relationship that they had with, with whites.  Now, my grandfather passed away, I believe, in the '70s [1970s] and my grandmother in the '90s [1990s], so, so this was well into the, into the 20th century and I just, you know, I couldn't understand it and now, I do understand it.  I have a much better understanding through my own personal readings and history through traveling back to Leesburg, his roots, the family roots, to see there, going through backcountry in Georgia and looking at those trees that actually bared what they call, the ugly fruit, the forbidden fruit of black bodies hanging from them.  And then finding out about other states, like Mississippi, like Alabama, going through those states and understanding that the way it is today there, is related to the way it was back in 1919, 1920. Actually my grandfather left in 1926 (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah--
Story_ID: 226200
Speaker 1: You said that there were, the stories of your [maternal] family about the end of slavery?  Is there any, did any of them talk about, you know, what your ancestors were doing at the end of slavery?  And what they were left with and that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: Well, my great-great-grandparents were what they call manumitted peoples.  They call them manumitted mean--
Speaker 1: So they were freed before the end of slavery or--
Speaker 2: No, they were freed--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --after slavery so they were legally, technically slaves and then through this process of manumission, they received their freedom and it was, it's my understanding that my great-great-grandparents on my grandfather's [Dock Freeney] side, were manumitted when they were like five or six years old.  So, so they actually, my great-great-grandparents had the real experience of being slaves, even though they were very young, and, but they were, they did receive their freedom at five, six, seven years old.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And from that point on, you know, they lived their lives in the South.
Speaker 1: Now is there a story about how your grandparents, or great-grandparents on your mother's [Norma Marie Freeney] side, came to Chicago [Illinois] because you said that a lot of them were in Chicago when you were growing up that they had made it up from Georgia?  So is there, do they tell why they left or were the circumstances under which they left, I mean, except for the, I know the one story, but is that the only story?
Speaker 2: Well, that's the major story but what it parallels, that story of my grandfather coming to Chicago, parallels a period in U.S. history called the Great Migration when black people basically were bookin' out the South for, for various reasons and which I'm starting to understand a lot better today but as you might imagine, hundreds of thousands of black men and women were leaving the South all at the same time.  They call it the Great Migration and they came to places like Chicago, like Detroit [Michigan], like Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] and for this to happen all at the same time, you know, instead of being spread out over a 25, 30 year window, this all happened in a few years.  And I'm starting to understand the reasons why.  The South was changing and so what would happen, and the Chicago Defender, the then-great Chicago Defender, was instrumental in this.  The word was going out across the country that there was real opportunity in the North, that the kind of things that were happening in the South, they weren't happening in the North.  The kinds of violence, the kinds of injustice that it theoretically wasn't happening in the North.  Now, I also know that up North there were some other kinds of injustices that were entrenched but in the South, or they were killing black people with the riots of 1919, with the riots of 1926, this is when, you know, across much of the South, it was almost as though there was a massive conspiracy by the small white towns--
Speaker 1: And also here too, 1919 is when they really tore up here in Chicago and the riot.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, and it was here in Chicago when the whites attacked the black people.  You're right, it wasn't just that, but there was still this perception that in the North, a black man could get a fairer shake, that a black man could get a little more opportunity.
Story_ID: 226201
Speaker 1: Did your mother [Norma Marie Freeney] talk about growing up or did your grandparents [Dock Freeney and Ella Freeney] talk about life in Chicago [Illinois], you know, before, after they got here and, I mean, in terms of, you know, telling you stories about their relationships with employers or how they were able to make a living?
Speaker 2: Well my mother unfortunately for almost all of her life, which was about 72, 73 years, she was mentally incapacitated from the very, from when I was very small through her death, so she, she was born here but she could never tell me those kinds of stories.  She had other issues.  She was hallucinogenic and delusional and--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --we never had those kinds of conversations.
Speaker 1: Okay, now did she, did she have a manic depression or schizophrenia or something like--
Speaker 2: Both.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Both.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: All of that and, and I don't know all the reasons why, you know.  She's, she's one of the few people in this large extended family who did have that as an issue and, in fact, during my early days in college [Roosevelt University, Chicago, Illinois], I thought that I was the same and I actually had to visit a psychiatrist.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it kicks in in adolescence is what I understand, you know.  It doesn't really manifest itself until adolescence.
Speaker 2: And that's what many of her friends said who knew her, they said that she was a wonderful young girl and younger, and that she, you know, that there were few signs of this but just as you're saying, as she got a little bit older, it did happen.  So I didn't hear those kinds of stories from my mother.
Story_ID: 226202
Speaker 1: From my grandmother, Momma Freeney [Ella Freeney], who I lived with, and that's my grandmother on my mother's [Norma Marie Freeney] side, and from my grandfather, Dada Freeney [Dock Freeney], I heard stories.  I mean, I heard stories about driving the hack in Macon, Georgia.  Macon was the big city down there and my grandfather used to drive a hack, a horse and buggy, Ginger, you know, and he used to always, you know, tell me that I needed to get a horse and buggy.  You know, here I am on the South Side of Chicago [Illinois], you know, trying to live in his, in his thing.  And then when I was growing up, in Chicago, about that same time, we actually had horse and buggies going through the alleys.  We had the coal man in the winter, the same guy, he'd be selling coal in the winter off his horse and buggy, this was in the '50s [1950s], late '50s [1950s], even into the early '60s [1960s], and then during the summer, same guy, he would sell coal in the winter, watermelon and ice during the summer, off a horse and buggy.  So, that took my grandfather back.  He said, "Yeah, I used to drive one of those, down South."  But then, you know, and he told me some stories about he drove a hack, that's, some taxis are now called hacks, but he drove a horse and a buggy taxi and he told me some of the stories about how his white passengers would mistreat him and, you know, sometimes to the point of violence.  And I--
Speaker 2: Can you tell us a specific story about that?
Speaker 1: Well, no, I can't tell you a specific one but I always wondered, why would you let 'em do that?  You know, here, I always wondered, why would you let anybody mistreat you?  I mean, if they hit you, you hit 'em back.  So I thought, I thought it was that simple but obviously it wasn't, it wasn't for him and even today, it's probably not that simple.  My grandmother used to tell me stories about going out into the fields.  Now, she told me that this was more her grandmother, going out into the fields and picking herbs and flowers and roots that could cure any ailment you got.  I said, wait a minute, Momma, I said no Momma Freeney, that's what doctors are for.  She said, no, no, not doctor, she said, no matter what ailed you, my grandmama could go out into the field and pick, you know, this flower, mix it with this root, put a little bit of this oil on it, she said she could fix anything you had wrong.
Speaker 2: Did, did she practice home remedies at home when you were growing up?
Speaker 1: My grandmother practiced some, just some, and she didn't, obviously, living in Chicago, you don't, we didn't--
Speaker 2: Did she ever practice on you?  I was just--
Speaker 1: Well, yeah, both my grandfather and my grandmother they used to, whenever I got sick, sometimes they'd put that ole home remedy on me and sometimes I thought the remedy was worse than the sickness but, yeah, they did a little bit.  But, hey, look at me, I'm relatively healthy and speaking of healthy, my grandfather lived to be about 90, 89, 90 and my grandmother lived to be 103, so they were doing something right.  Somehow, and now, as we know, they don't make them that way anymore.
Story_ID: 226203
Speaker 1: Did your grandmother [Ella Freeney] tell you about your mother's [Norma Marie Freeney] growing up at all and what kind of person she was when she was, before she got ill?
Speaker 2: No, she really didn't.  She just loved her.  Now, she loved my mother very much and my mother was a kind of a genius in that on a piano, she could listen to anybody play anything once, and then she can play it.  All she had to do was hear it and play it and I didn't, I couldn't appreciate that.  So she would listen to Ray Charles and Ray Charles would play, dadadada, and she'd hear it and then she'd, dadadada, and she'd play it better than Ray Charles.  She would hear Liberace play something on the piano and then she'd hear, and then she'd play what Liberace played.  And I, and I didn't appreciate it but now I know that was a, it's a kind of genius that few people, that I don't know of anyone else who had that.  I mean, she was, it was amazing that she could do that.
Speaker 1: Now did your, did your mother have a chance to finish school and, and work, you know, before she got sick or--
Speaker 2: She, she did finish high school and I believe she worked on one job for a couple of years.
Speaker 1: Now did she, what high school did she go to?
Speaker 2: I believe it was, it was either Carver [George Washington Carver High School; Carver Military Academy, Chicago, Illinois] or Englewood [High School; Englewood Technical Preparatory Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois] and I believe it was Carver because we were living in Altgeld Gardens [Homes, Chicago, Illinois] at that time.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I believe it was Carver and the rest, a lot of my family went to Englewood.  They went to Englewood, actually before Carver because we lived in the Englewood, the family, I wasn't around, but the family lived in the Englewood school district on 64th [Street] and Rhodes [Avenue] and the kid, the young people, my grandmother's kids, went to Englewood, then we moved out to Altgeld Gardens, I believe, in 1944, I wasn't around, '44 [1944], '45 [1945] and that's where my mom finished high school.
Speaker 1: Okay, then did she live with the family most of the time or was she hospitalized or--
Speaker 2: Well, she was hospitalized most of the time and when she wasn't hospitalized, she lived with the family.
Speaker 1: Okay, now is there anything that you remember about, I mean that you can tell us about her that you remember you think that it's important for this interview?
Speaker 2: Well, there were, as I said, there was a genius about my mother and, you know, that I had not seen in anyone, her ability to, with music--
Speaker 1: Was she able to like, you know, play for churches or maybe play for, you know, people that--
Speaker 2: She could play for churches, she could play, when you say did she--
Speaker 1: Did she, yeah, that's what--
Speaker 2: Well, if she was in the church, she'd play for the church.  If she was in the night club, she'd play for the night club.  Wherever she was, and there's a piano there, and whatever music that they required, she could play that music.  She could, if you needed gospel, she played gospel.  If you needed to rock the juke joint, she could, she could rock the joint.  If you needed some calm funeral music, she could, it was a kind of genius.  Now, you asked me if there were any takeaways or if I've learned anything.  I've learned from her, especially with what I'm doing, that I've got to have that same kind of adaptability and creativity wherever I go, if I'm in a church and I'm working with church folks, I've got to make those church folks understand.  If I'm over at Cook County Jail [Chicago, Illinois] which I do do time, not my own personal time, but I go over to work with the young guys in the jail, then I've got to make sure that I've adapted to what these young men are so that I can reach them.  So that's my takeaway, to be able, wherever you are, to reach whoever you're talking to and so that's what I learned from my mother.
Story_ID: 226204
Speaker 1: Oh, one more thing about the Freeney side, do you know anything about the origin, the name Freeney?  It sounds Irish but I, it's a singular kind of name.  You don't hear it very much, but--
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's the Freeney plantation down in Georgia.  It's where I learned about picking cotton, 'bacco, peanuts.  I've never picked it by the way but I've learned about it from my, from my family, from my grandfather [Dock Freeney], my grandmother [Ella Freeney], and actually some of my aunts and uncles remember having to pick cotton when they were younger as well.  They don't relish it, they don't think, they don't, it wasn't the high point of their lives, but they remember picking cotton.  Now, it's changed a lot but that was the economy back then.  That was, I mean, if you needed a job, all you had to do was walk into the field, put a bag on your back and start, you know, chopping cotton, picking cotton.  It's changed.  Life has changed but that's where that name comes from, the Freeney plantation down there.
Speaker 1: Freeney, okay.
Speaker 2: And if you know, what I've learned about the South is, the South is set up on a plantation system, an agricultural plantation system.
Speaker 1: Sure.
Speaker 2: Much of the South is still set up that way, today.
Story_ID: 226205
Speaker 1: Now, I want to ask you about your father's side of the family and can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Yes, Stewart, S-T-E-W-A-R-T, Dine, D-I-N-E, Jackson, J-A-C-K-S-O-N.
Speaker 1: Okay, now does he go by the name of Stewart Dine Jackson?
Speaker 2: Yes, Stewart Dine Jackson.
Speaker 1: Okay.  The reason why I ask is cause I always know, I've known him as John [H.] Jackson, so I don't know, you know, why he's called John.
Speaker 2: John Jackson, that's really my uncle, but he's--
Speaker 1: Oh, okay, so that's your uncle, okay.
Speaker 2: --that's my Uncle Johnnie, Button Man.
Speaker 1: Right, yes, that's right.
Speaker 2: Mr. Right, that's him.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: And my Uncle Johnnie is the older brother to my father, Stewart Dine Jackson and I do a lot here in Chicago [Illinois] with Mr. Right, Button, Mr. R-I-G-H-T, Right, Button Man, John H. Jackson.
Speaker 1: Right, he's a pretty familiar figure in black political circles, passing out buttons and, he's always at a rally, you know, doing something, you know, to, I guess, encourage the candidates or the activists or the, you know--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --always volunteering--
Story_ID: 226206
Speaker 1: In terms of your father [Stewart Dine Jackson], now, can you give us your father's date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: October 1st is his birth date and he's a couple years older than my mother [Norma Marie Freeney] and so he was either born in the late '20s [1920s] or early '30s [1930s], as well.  He was born in LaGrange, Illinois.
Speaker 1: Okay, can you spell that for us?
Speaker 2: L-A, capital "L," small "A," capital G-R-A-N-G-E.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, now what do you know about his side of the family?  How far back can you trace those ancestors?
Speaker 2: Well I can only go back to my grandparents, on his side of the family, and that is Daisy [Jackson], his mom, and John Jackson, Sr., his dad.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And they came out of Maryland, out of Fruitland, Maryland, and they migrated to Illinois, into LaGrange at that time.  Fruitland, Maryland was, was the South, you know, it's all the South at that time.  They migrated here under slightly different circumstances than my [maternal] relatives in Georgia, who came up from Georgia.  It was less traumatic, so to say, but still a part of that Great Migration and their leaving the South and coming to the--
Speaker 1: So they, they came here specifically, they just went west to, I mean, you know, north to just make--
Speaker 2: For opportunity.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: For opportunity.  They weren't run out of town.
Speaker 1: It seems like, though that, I mean, did they come on a major railway or something or, you know, 'cause it seemed like an odd route to go, to get from Fruitland, Maryland to LaGrange, Illinois.  Did they go directly to LaGrange or did they just kind of happen to be, I mean, find a way to LaGrange?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, both of my parents, both sides of my family, did the unconventional.  Most black people in the City of Chicago [Illinois], especially on the West Side and much of the South Side, they come up from the southern states, just below Illinois, Memphis [Tennessee]-- Tennessee, Arkansas, Mississippi because that's the way the railroad line ran.  Most of the black people on the [East] Coast, they settled in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], in New York and Boston [Massachusetts] because that's the way the railroad lines ran.  And you're absolutely right, the railroad lines were in the central part of these migratory patterns of black people.  So, basically, you could almost go to any city, and if you want to guess accurately where black people came from, you just look at the railroad lines 'cause that's what they did.  They got to the nearest train and rode it up north.  So, both parts of my family are out of the norm.  They came west first and then went up.  And on my father's side [sic. maternal grandfather, Dock Freeney], he actually settled in Detroit [Michigan] first and actually as I told you, it was more traumatic.  He had to leave town without my grandmother [Ella Freeney].  He just had, he was a black man who just had to get out of town.  So he just left and left the family there and he struck out to try and find a place where the family could resettle again.  He went to Detroit first, back in 1926, but then moved at the latter part of that year to Chicago, sent for my grandmother and that's how we got started here on that side of the family.  On my father's side, it was more of an orderly transition, coming west to Chicago area and ending up in LaGrange, Illinois.
Speaker 1: Okay, it was just sort of a suburb of Chicago.
Speaker 2: Just southwest, just southwest of Chicago.
Story_ID: 226207
Speaker 1: Did your father [Stewart Dine Jackson] talk about growing up in Chicago [Illinois]?  What it was like for him?
Speaker 2: No. No, he didn't really talk a lot to me about growing up.
Speaker 1: Is he still alive?
Speaker 2: He is still alive.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He's in Oakland, California right now.
Speaker 1: Your mother [Norma Marie Freeney], is she still alive?
Speaker 2: She is not alive.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: No, she passed away about two years ago from brain cancer.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, so your father, he didn't really talk about growing up?  Or do you know any way about how he grew up and, you know?
Speaker 2: I know a little bit about how he grew up.  I, he met my mother out in Altgeld Gardens [Homes, Chicago, Illinois].  He was actually working out at Altgeld Gardens, I believe, in the engineering or maintenance section of the Gardens and she, obviously, lived out there with my parents [sic. grandparents] at the time and, and actually, I was born in Altgeld Gardens but we only lived there for eight days before we moved to my new residence on 43rd Street [Chicago, Illinois].  So we moved September 14th, off of, out of Altgeld Gardens, I'm sorry, we moved on September 30th, eight days after I was born, out of Altgeld Gardens.
Speaker 1: This is 1950?
Speaker 2: In 1950--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --to 43rd and Wentworth [Avenue], which was mostly white, by the way.  The same kind of ethnic movement patterns that we see everywhere, all the time, they were happening back in 1950, moving from black neighborhoods to white neighborhoods and whites going to another neighborhood.  So--
Speaker 1: Now that neighborhood, though, at 43rd, I guess, that would have been close to what we, what we call Bridgeport [Chicago, Illinois], I guess, right?
Speaker 2: That is correct.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: That was an extension of Canaryville, Bridgeport, Fuller Park.
Speaker 1: Yes, what we would say would be a rock-ribbed Irish, you know, community, you know.
Speaker 2: It was different.
Speaker 1: Pretty much, yeah.
Speaker 2: It was different.
Speaker 1: Hardcore, Irish community.
Speaker 2: Yeah, but, but it was in change, though.  It was in change when we went over there and there were a set of railroad tracks, that are still there, by the way, and that was the dividing line.  Everything to the east of the railroad track, it was almost like Bridgeport and Canaryville and Armour Square, said, we gonna let black people have that and everything to the west of the railroad track, you get your head cracked if you walked over there.  Now that's--
Speaker 1: Now that's a, that seemed to be tradition in Chicago, to draw that boundary and to have a baseball bat or whatever it is, enforce the--
Speaker 2: To enforce it.
Speaker 1: --boundary, it still, I mean, it still goes on to some extent and even as we speak the Chicago, you know, it has--
Speaker 2: It was real.  When I was growing up, it was real.  There was that line and, again, I didn't understand it.  I just knew I couldn't go on that side of that viaduct.  I knew that--
Speaker 1: It's getting less and less but they're still, I mean, every now and then there's a case of somebody getting beat up with a ball bat, you know (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah.
Story_ID: 226208
Speaker 1: My father [Stewart Dine Jackson] and my mother [Norma Marie Freeney] weren't together early on in my life.  So, I knew my mother and my mother's relatives more than I knew my father and his relatives.  As I got older, I would, I was spending more and more time with my father and I actually went to live with my father when I became, I think, eleven.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So the first ten years of my life was spent with my mother and her relatives.  The next set of years were spent with my father and his relatives, and my stepmother, Carolyn Barren [ph.].
Speaker 2: Okay, now what, what was she like?  I mean, can you describe her for us?
Speaker 1: She was a young woman, a younger woman.  She had a daughter of her own and she adopted, along with my father, of course, me and three of my four sisters.  So she went from having a daughter of her own to having five kids and it created, you know, some issues, some stress, economically, you know, all this goes back to economics.  Having one child is a tremendous economic burden and then to go from one child to five children, it's a major stress on an economy, now, on a family's economy.  My family, the year after we moved with them, we moved into public housing and in moving into public housing, Robert Taylor Homes [Chicago, Illinois], there were certain things that happened, such as my stepmother and my father were having trouble getting employment for, for the natural flows and ebbs of the economy.  So we lived in public housing and we took government checks and we, you know, we struggled, struggled.  And moving into public housing, we moved into public housing when it was brand new, spanking new, the first family moving into the apartment.  When we moved in, they were still laying the grass.  There was no grass there and we moved in and they would put down the grass and, and it was kind of a new adventure for us and it was really one of the nicest apartments and buildings that we had lived in, you know, as a family.  It was relatively adequate, a three-bedroom apartment at 5323 South Federal [Street], Apartment 709, but in a matter of months, it became hell.  A matter of months.  We lived in the neighborhood called, that the people call The Hole.  Now, The Hole was a place where, at the beginning, on the low end, they screened everybody.  You know, you had to have this, you had to have this, you had to have a job, and before you could move into public housing, you had to have an interview.  When we got to my end, up on the high end, they said, just put them somewhere, put 'em in there, and that was what became The Hole because they just took black people, threw them in there, poor black people, uneducated black people, they threw 'em in The Hole and The Hole became hell.
Speaker 2: So what, about what year is this that we're talking about here?
Speaker 1: Well this is--
Speaker 2: In the '60s [1960s] right?
Speaker 1: --this was the beginning of public housing, Robert Taylor's.  It started down on the low end, probably about 1960.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And by the time we got to The Hole, it was 1962, '62 [1962], maybe '63 [1963].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But that was The Hole.
Story_ID: 226209
Speaker 1: Yeah, what they say in Chicago [Illinois]--and other cities too--is when public housing first started, it didn't have the stigma that it has now, being the projects and. When it started off, it was well-kept, maintained, people, as you said, had to be screened and they had jobs for the most part and it was transitional housing from, you know, from public housing to a house or something, someplace else.  But, it started, you say, it started to deteriorate around '62 [1962], '63 [1963]?
Speaker 2: When we moved in.  I'm saying that it was, you could see it, you could feel it from the moment you moved in, and I was only a little boy.  So in '62 [1962], I was twelve and at twelve, I'm standing there going, this ain't going to work, you know.
Speaker 1: Now do you have, now this is interesting.  I've never interviewed anybody that actually worked for public housing, I think.  I don't think I have but this is, I've heard stories of how things came to be the way they were in public housing and community organizers and activists talked about, you know, the city, you know, using, I mean, getting control of public housing and then, you know, divvying up the gigs to political hacks and stuff, or cronies instead of the maintenance people and people that lived in the place and so you had like absentee employees there and, I mean, that's some stuff I've heard now, you lived there and you also were head of CHA [Chicago Housing Authority].  I just want to ask you what your perspective is on that now.  I mean, do you, can you, in looking back from the position you are in now, see how it failed, I mean, or how it started to fail.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.  A name that comes from the past, that period, is a name Charlie Swibel [Charles R. Swibel], and that was, was a time when there was, for lack of a better word, a major disinvestment in the infrastructure and in the social fabric of public housing.  Now, I didn't know Mr. Swibel.  I, you know, I didn't know him and I've only read about him.  I've read a lot of information about him but apparently, as you said, he used public housing as his own, you know, as his own fiefdom, and if you did that, if anyone did that, then obviously it was, it was a major problem, especially something of this magnitude.  I mean, public housing in Chicago was a city within a city.  I mean, it was huge.  If you had taken all the public housing units out of Chicago and put 'em separate, it would have been the second largest city in Illinois.  I mean, bigger than Rockford [Illinois], Peoria [Illinois], Springfield [Illinois], any of those.  So this was a city within a city that one man controlled and the oversight from what I know and from having been in certain positions, apparently the oversight over him wasn't there.  There were a lot of people.  You can't just blame something like that on one person.  A lot of people apparently, you know, didn't do their jobs and, from the president on down to, I'm talking about president of the United States and the secretaries of HUD [United States Department of Housing and Urban Development], on down, so it's not just one man but in looking at this, it wasn't just Chicago.  This same scenario was being replicated all over the country, every, and St. Louis [Missouri] at Pruitt-Igoe, and Detroit [Michigan] and New York [New York], and less so in New York for various reasons, but in Newark, New Jersey and Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], you had these huge public development high-rises, totally out of control and not serving the people who lived in them.
Story_ID: 226210
Speaker 1: So, yes, yes. But as I said, at twelve, I looked at this and I said, this ain't gonna work.  I don't know how I got here, but this is not going to work and you could go, I went, I lived in The Hole [at Robert Taylor Homes] which was down on 53rd Street [Chicago, Illinois], you go to the end of the fire lane and you look and as far as your eye could see, all you could see is public housing, as far as your eye could see, basically from about 55th Street on down to 18th Street where [Raymond] Hilliard Homes [Hilliard Towers Apartments, Chicago, Illinois] are now, it was all public housing.  Robert Taylor was twenty-eight buildings going from 55th [Street] to 39th [Street], then you ran into Stateway [Gardens, Chicago, Illinois] which was another nine, twelve building.  Then you ran into Dearborn Homes [Chicago, Illinois] and you ran into the [Harold L.] Ickes [Homes, Chicago, Illinois], then you ran into, and to put these many poor black people together in this kind of concentration, was pure evil, it was pure evil.  Those black people had no chance whatsoever.  Now, what happened is that they started inculcating certain value systems, it's what we call project, that's what, what black people say, "Man, you project," and what that meant was that you've adopted a certain value system for yourself.  You may not have had it before you went into public housing, but apparently somehow, someway, you've adopted a value system that is going to be destructive to your personal wealth.  It's going to be destructive to your family.  It's going to be destructive to everything around you and you've adopted the project mentality.  That project mentality was everything from, you know, having multiple kids out of wedlock to engaging in violent behavior at--
Speaker 2: Now why would, why would a young woman or, want to have, or multiple kids out of wedlock?
Speaker 1: Well, that question is more of a puzzle today than it was back then.  You see, this is back in the '60s [1960s] and '70s [1970s], I'm talking about, and there's certain reasons why.  Back in the '60s [1960s] and '70s [1970s], you got paid for the number of children you had, and if you, you know, you had two children, you got a paycheck that said, this is for two.
Speaker 2: Sure, your welfare, you know, right--
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was related to.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But today, when we've got a different scenario which is, young women are basically penalized for having children, out of wedlock, why are they doing it to the same degree or more, even today, including some 14 to 18 year olds who are intentionally, I mean, this, surveys have been done, they are intentionally, actively trying to have children out of wedlock.  So back then, you know, I'm not saying that it was justified, but you can kind of understand it, that there was this thing from the great public welfare fathers who said, we're going to take care of the people, they can't help themselves, so they're going to have babies, well, we're going to take care of the babies on one condition, the man can't be in the house.  Now that was the beginning of the end for black people and probably for the whole country.  When we bought into a public assistance or a public welfare system that said, "We're going to take care of you but the man can't be in the house."  Now that, that was antithetical to everything that we did coming up from the South.  You know, my, I told you about my grandmother and grandfather, you see, there was not any way, there was no way, that either of my grandfathers, my, my Grandpa [John] Jackson [Sr.] or Grandpa [Dock] Freeney, you could not separate them from their women or their family.  There was no way.  You'd have to kill 'em.  That's the only way you could separate them.  You, I mean, you couldn't do it any other way.  However, there's this new public policy, public welfare agenda that's saying, we will refuse to support an intact family.  The only families that we're going to support are families that have female headed households.  That was the beginning of the end but that still doesn't explain today why young women are actively seeking to become mothers when they know, and I suspect they know this, they know that when they become mothers, their lives are pretty much over.  It's not, there's almost nothing they can do.  They know that they're going to be, if they stay with their children now, you've got some options here.  You can just give up your children or not take care of your children if that's the kind of mother you want to be, but if you're going to try to raise your children as a single household mom today, you're almost dedicating yourself to a life of poverty, you know, because you're going to have to give up a lot of things to take care of that child that is going to need so much and the other thing about that, you're almost guaranteeing that that child is going to grow up in a life of poverty.  And so that's why, back then, you asked me, why would they?  I can almost understand why they would back then.  It's today that I'm puzzled about.
Speaker 2: Okay, now some of this (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And it all comes out of this thing called a project mentality.
Story_ID: 226211
Speaker 1: In terms of growing up, can you, well I'm going to take you like earlier than the projects now, and just, and ask you this question that we always ask, you know, just, what was your first childhood memory?
Speaker 2: Playing on a stoop on 43rd [Street, Chicago, Illinois] and Wentworth [Avenue].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Being out on, late on a summer night.  My grandparents [Ella Freeney and Dock Freeney] owned a grocery store there and whether I was three or four, just running up and down the street and playing, playing in the vacant lot that was right next door to us, eating popsicles and snowballs, those were some of my earliest memories.
Story_ID: 226212
Speaker 1: What are some of the sights and sounds and smells of the neighborhood?
Speaker 2: Well, a part of the neighborhood, and this is 43rd Street [Chicago, Illinois], was broken glass.  I didn't realize until much later in life that every place in the world didn't have broken glass.  So, everywhere around me it was, you know, broken glass and, obviously, where does broken glass come from?  It comes from broken bottles.  It comes from somebody breaking bottles and breaking, so most of my life, even when I lived in public housing, I told you that they put out new grass and that lasted about three months and then from that point on, it was broken glass, again.  So I thought, at least I said, if, at least if I'm living here in this new public housing now, at least I've got grass. We had it for three months, then it was broken glass again, everywhere around us but--
Story_ID: 226213
Speaker 1: Coming up, early memories were playing a lot, my grandfather [Dock Freeney] working.  Now that was, you know, that was the person who I saw work more than anyone else and he's probably where I get my work ethic from.  His work ethic came from when he was a little boy.  When he was six, his father died and he had to go into the cotton fields.  So, he had gone to the second grade in elementary school and that's as far as he ever went, second grade.  From there, it was into the cotton fields, pickin' cotton.  That's what he knew and that's what he did and that's what he knew and that's what he taught me.  And so, while I'm five, six, seven, my grandfather is teaching me like he was taught when he was five, six and seven.  Now, we didn't have cotton on 43rd Street but we did do a lot of things.  You know, he had take me in the backyard and he would plant crops.  He had tomatoes, he had corn growing, you know, he'd be growing some greens sometimes and we had to tend the crops in the backyard because that's what he knew.  And, you know, and I didn't understand it, you know, I couldn't understand it.  He'd get out the water hose and water and I said, why are you putting water on this stuff?  Can't it rain?  But, so he was teaching me all these values that he had that he thought were right.  He was an early riser, get up at five o'clock every day, you know, and so forth.  He, and he worked hard.  He worked at the steel mills when he was here and, which was very hard work.  It was similar to choppin' cotton down South.  I mean, I mean, it's backbreaking work but that's what he taught me.  He worked one other place.  He worked the railroads, on the road.  He used to tell us about running on top of them boxcars while they, while they're running and, and Betsy, the train, the engine, he'd say be, be singing to us, whoa, whoa, and he was, you know.  I didn't understand it.  I'm going, what this guy, what is he talking about?  But he was telling me about the life of a black man, basically, from about 1915 to about maybe 1950 or 1960, 1950, and I didn't know it.  I had no idea.  I couldn't imagine what the life of a black man was like but on 43rd Street [Chicago, Illinois], back in the 1950s, you know, it was different.  We didn't have cotton fields, I didn't have, I didn't have to hobo on the trains, you know.  I wasn't going to work in the steel mills so I was learning really a whole new life.  And so I started learning something that my grandfather never knew and that was about school.  And just like I couldn't understand his life, he couldn't understand my life.
Story_ID: 226214
Speaker 1: Now where did you start school?
Speaker 2: Hendricks Elementary School [Thomas A. Hendricks Elementary Community Academy, Chicago, Illinois], on 43rd [Street] and Princeton [Avenue].
Speaker 1: How do you spell Hendricks?
Speaker 2: H-E-N-D-R-I-C-K-S.
Speaker 1: Okay, 43rd and Princeton.
Speaker 2: Forty-third and Princeton.  And in fact, my grandfather [Dock Freeney], on my first day of school, took me to school, into kindergarten.  I'll always remember that.  While he couldn't understand it, he knew that it was important that I go to school and, by the way, he couldn't read.  I mean, he only graduated from second, he only matriculated to the second grade but he knew that school was important for me, or at least up to the second grade, actually he knew more, but he took me there.
Speaker 1: So, how long did you attend Hendricks?
Speaker 2: I attended Hendricks through the fourth grade.
Speaker 1: Okay, through four, okay.  Now, what kind of student were you in school?
Speaker 2: Not a very good one.  In fact, I failed the second grade which there, maybe my grandfather was right, maybe second grade was as far as I was meant to go but I failed the second grade and, for various reasons, but, so they, you know, when I left Hendricks, there was nobody crying that they were losing a great student.  So--
Speaker 1: But what did you like?  Did you like school?
Speaker 2: I didn't, no, no, I didn't really like it but I didn't know to like it.  It's something that I've learned about education is, education itself is a transmitted value.  It is transmitted, not in the school building, it's transmitted in the home.  It's an acquired transmitted, structured, cultural value.  So it's not whether or not I liked school that's important, it's whether or not the household that I was in appreciated school for what it was, whether it valued school for what it was, and while, you know, my grandmother [Ella Freeney], who was in that same household, she was a teacher in school.  She only had an eighth grade education, and that's all you needed to be a teacher in the South in those days because, obviously, the educational levels were not what they are today, but she was a teacher and she loved education, Momma Freeney, and she tried to overcome that but basically, you know, there wasn't enough support and structure for it.  I didn't even go to school.  So, in the second grade, I don't know, you know, I used to ditch school and play hooky or whatever they call it and so, no, I didn't like school and there were other issues.  I mean, my sister, my older sister, Gloria [ph.], she had a, an accident where she was burned very badly.  My mother [Norma Marie Freeney], by the way, in one of her just points of being unaware, she let a pot of hot water, boiling, scalding hot water, fall on my sister and it caused severe, severe burns that put my sister in the hospital for quite a while.  So, so all of that, all that trauma, all of, all of the fact that I didn't grow up in a classical family where you've got your mother and your father and this and that, I didn't grow up in any of that so I didn't have the structure to tell me that school was important to me, that school was a place I should be in, many of the days I was not.  Now, you know, I lived with a lot of my relatives or cousins who lived with me.  There were aunts and uncles who lived there but there really wasn't a driving force for me, educationally--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --in those years, between kindergarten.
Speaker 1: I can understand that that sounds like a pretty rough situation, I mean, to try to focus on school in the midst of all that.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was, well, yeah.  I'm not, I'm not complaining.  Some of the children today have got it ten times worse than I had it.  And so when educators come to me and say, oh this boy just won't learn, they don't understand, you know.  I've been there.  I've been where the boy is.  I haven't, you haven't lived what he's living.  So it's not that he won't learn, what have you done to really reach into him and to help to create that desire for that young man to want to become educated?  And many educators, they don't have that answer.  So, but, yeah, so it wasn't great, but there are kids today who have lived through a lot worse than what I lived through and some of those kids do well.
Story_ID: 226215
Speaker 1: Did you have a favorite aspect of school at all in these early grades [Hendricks Elementary School; Thomas A. Hendricks Elementary Community Academy, Chicago, Illinois] and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, math.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I liked mathematics, and we used to play flashcards where they would show you a flashcard and you'd look and then you, you know, you would add up, add it up and you'd call the number and you'd move up a row, and it was usually boys against the girls, and I liked flashcards.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, Hendricks, you were there when you lived off 43rd Street, right?
Speaker 2: That is correct.
Speaker 1: And then you moved?
Speaker 2: Moved, and spent a year over in Hyde Park [Chicago, Illinois], went to [Charles] Kozminski [Elementary School; Charles Kozminski Elementary Community Academy, Chicago, Illinois] for a year, Kozminski Elementary School.
Speaker 1: Did you go to Hyde Park grade school?  I mean--
Speaker 2: No I didn't--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --Kozminski one year--
Speaker 1: Kozminski, okay.
Speaker 2: --fifth grade and--
Speaker 1: And that's K-O-S--
Speaker 2: K-O-S-M-I-N, I'm sorry, K-O-Z, Koz--
Speaker 1: K-O-Z--
Speaker 2: K-O-Z-M-I-N-S-K-I.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Charles P. Kozminski, I believe.
Speaker 1: And you were there from, what?
Speaker 2: For one year, fifth grade--
Speaker 1: One year, okay.
Speaker 2: --whatever year that is.
Speaker 1: Fifth grade.  Now had you, at this point, did you, 'cause I know from, well, I think I know from talking to your uncle [John H. Jackson], that you were quite a student at one point.
Speaker 2: Well, in--
Speaker 1: But when did it kick in?  Did it--
Speaker 2: At Kozminski.
Speaker 1: Kozminski, okay.
Speaker 2: At Kozminski, I--
Speaker 1: Well, what happened at Kozminski that, to change your--
Speaker 2: Well actually, I actually moved into a more, with my, with my father [Stewart Dine Jackson] and my stepmother [Carolyn Barren (ph.)], I moved into a more structured setting.  I mean, kids don't need a lot and so with, although my grandmother [Ella Freeney] and my grandfather [Dock Freeney], they gave me lots of love and lots of, you know, what they gave me what they could, they gave me what they knew, but I didn't have a structure, a real hands-on parental structure.  So when I moved in with my father and my stepmother, they provided a parental structure, you know, and I'm, I'm not saying that they were both rich or that they were both super educated, but they gave, you don't need that.  I only needed a structure and so by simply having a parental structure, I changed, almost overnight.  I mean, from fourth grade on back and then fifth grade, and remember, I did second grade twice, so, I mean, I was there for a few years, but at fifth grade, I had a structure and the structure said, well, you have to do homework.
Speaker 1: Now, you, did you have contact with your father from the time you were a small child?  I mean--
Speaker 2: Not much.
Speaker 1: Regular, okay.
Speaker 2: He, not much.  He would come and see us sometimes and he would bring us stuff.  You know, he did the stuff then that, you know, that some fathers do now.  They say, I'm going to take this to my boy or I'm going to give my kids this, and that's not what kids need.  I mean, that's nice; that might make you feel good, but that's not what children need.  Children need a structure.
Story_ID: 226216
Speaker 1: Did your father [Stewart Dine Jackson] ever tell you about when he decided that he needed to actually come back and get you and to--?
Speaker 2: Well, there was a time when I was ten, I believe, when my father came to my [maternal] grandmama's [Ella Freeney] house, Mama Freeney's house, and he had a conversation with her and then he had a conversation with us and we, you know, ten is not, you know, I had more cognition at that point.  My, and my other sisters, one was Gloria [ph.], was eleven, Rose [ph.] was eight and Joann [ph.] was six, I believe at that time, and he asked us, he said, "Do you all want to come live, live with me?"  And, you know, what, you know, we looked at each other and said, yeah, I guess.  You know, we didn't know.  We're just kids and we've only known one thing and so at that point, we said, "Yeah, we'll come live with you," and that's, that was it.  And you know, and so when you, I can't tell you, you know, what he was thinking.  I can tell you that he did come back and he asked, he asked, he spoke with my grandmother, he spoke with us, now, you know, I can assume, I can assume that he said, you know, I've been away from my kids too long and I want to be in their lives.  I can assume that he said, you know, their mom [Norma Marie Freeney] is not doing well and they need structure or they need something, I can assume he said that or thought that.
Speaker 1: I guess when you think too, your grandparents just said, we're very old--
Speaker 2: They were old.
Speaker 1: --and your, and your mother didn't have the capacity to do it.
Speaker 2: And she didn't have the, they were old.  You know, that's why a lot of people say, I have old ways.  They say, man, you've got old, well I had old people raising me from when I was young, you know.  I believe when my grandparents started raising me, I was, they were in their late sixties or seventies.  That's a little old to be dealing with kids, although grandparents today are doing the same thing, unfortunately, and great-grandparents are doing it, unfortunately.  It takes a younger person to deal with, to deal properly, with the energy of youth and you've got to be able to structure it, you know, you've got to be able to follow the kids and to go with them and to help channel and guide their energies, and my grandparents, they couldn't do that.  So that's what happened and so it was fifth grade [at Charles Kozminski Elementary School; Charles Kozminski Elementary Community Academy, Chicago, Illinois] that I started living with my father.
Story_ID: 226217
Speaker 1: Now were there any teachers in the fifth grade, and subsequently in grade school--now where did you go next after [Charles] Kozminski [Elementary School; Charles Kozminski Elementary Community Academy, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: After Kozminski, I, we were in public housing at that point, so we spent one year at Kozminski and boom, into public housing which was a whole, which was a whole--
Speaker 1: So that's when you moved to--
Speaker 2: To the Robert Taylors [Robert Taylor Homes, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Robert Taylor, and you went to school, where?
Speaker 2: We started off at John Farren [Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois]--
Speaker 1: Farren, yeah.
Speaker 2: --it became quickly overcrowded and they moved us into the buildings, I mean, this was a time of explosion.  I mean, the planners who had planned this great experiment called Robert Taylors, they forgot that all these people were going to need more schools.  They didn't have them.  So we had to go to school in the building.  And if you can imagine, you know, going to school in your, where you live, I mean, it wasn't the best situation.
Speaker 1: Kind of locked you into a very tight space all the time.
Speaker 2: You, I mean, you never had to leave the building.  I mean, which is, that's not really a good thing to be, but you went up to your apartment, depending upon where the school was, but you come down, go into another apartment for the school, then you go into another apartment, they had a little store there, and all this is, and you never had to leave the building, and that, that's really not a--
Speaker 1: Now was there something that happened to your father's [Stewart Dine Jackson] income during this time 'cause you said he did maintenance for the CHA [Chicago Housing Authority] at one time?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he did maintenance.  He left that job and then, I believe, he did some work at the post office and then, I believe, he was a painter before we moved into Robert Taylors and then, it may have been, I think for two or three years while we were there, I think he was unemployed.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, and, so I don't know what happened to his income.  I know that, you know, living in the Robert, living, everybody was poor, and I don't know if that's good or bad, but I do know that everybody was poor.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And it was bad.  To put that many low income people, not just black people, but when you put all low income people in that kind of a situation, it's evil.  It cannot breed anything good.  You see, we didn't, at the school that I went to, or all the schools that I went to, because of my finding myself in fifth grade, at Kozminski, they said, well you're the smart boy and then from then on, they separated me from the rest of the kids.  And so, they say, we're going to put all the smart kids over here and they kept us apart from the rest of the kids.
Speaker 1: That's track.
Speaker 2: Tracked us.
Speaker 1: Tracking, right.
Speaker 2: They tracked us, and that was, you know, that was good for the smart kids, but for the thousands of other kids who might have benefitted from being in, in interaction with a peer role model, they didn't have it.  All they had was failure and mediocrity around them.
Speaker 1: I would assume, too, that there are many more in the failure group than in the smart kid group?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it may be ten to one, maybe twenty to one.
Speaker 1: Did you think this is the roots, this situation is the root of today's, well, it's become, axiomatic to say that in the projects today and in poor black communities, those who are smart are ostracized and told that they're acting like their white people or they're not, you know, they're nerds and all this sort of thing.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think that that's a--
Speaker 1: A certain amount of resentment.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think that it actually started, or some of it started back then because we used to get beat up a lot.  I mean, we used to get beat if you, the smart kids, and I couldn't figure it out but they was always on us.  We, you know, get robbed a lot, beat up a lot, but, you know, we thought that that's the cost of doing business, you know, that's, it became so, so natural that, you know, you just, we accepted it and that's wrong.  When you're being physically beaten or robbed becomes just a natural thing, a natural part of your day, well that was us.
Story_ID: 226218
Speaker 1: People in the projects and that kind of situation are often squeezed by both sides and--did police harass the people there in those days?  I mean, did you feel a sense of being afraid of the police too?
Speaker 2: Actually, there weren't enough of 'em.  I wanted more police and, you know, I wanted the, wanted, no, wanted anybody to come in and control the situation, such as at the school, and I went to DuSable Upper Grades Center [sic. DuSable Upper Grade Center, Chicago, Illinois], also when I was down there, but at the school, at DuSable Upper Grades Center, they had this huge field, it was a gravel field, and on the field every day they left two thousand preteens and teenagers between the ages of probably twelve and fifteen, on this gravel field, by themselves, unsupervised, every day, for hours and you might imagine that these kids are going to figure something out and what they figured out is, well let's form gangs, which they did.  I mean, they're unsupervised, and then the gangs said, well let's beat up these kids, which they did, and so that time in my life was very traumatic because I used to have nightmares every night about getting beat up the next day at school.
Speaker 1: You had some kind of natural infantile log going on out there, you know, I guess, so--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, and actually those, and those, I'm serious about the nightmares.  I used to have nightmares about going to school.  Didn't want to go to school because they were doing a kind of psychological warfare where every day they would pick certain kids, mostly the smart kids, they'd jump on 'em, they'd beat 'em to the point of, sometimes kids would have broken arms and all kind of stuff and, you know, it wouldn't make you feel too good about being smart or about going to school, but, and so, you know, but we weathered it and, but still, up until the time I was probably forty, I used to wake up in cold sweat being chased across that field with 40, 50 young men behind me 'cause that's what I saw all the time.  And then when they catched whoever it was, they'd just beat 'em.  But, and so you ask me about the police.  Where were the police?  You asked me if I was upset about harassment.  We wanted anybody to come out and stop that and there was nobody.
Story_ID: 226219
Speaker 1: How would you describe yourself in those days as a young man?  What kind of a--
Speaker 2: Smart and scared. And so, I didn't like going outside, which might have been a good thing because that meant I was in the house studying.  Going outside was fraught with danger, every time you, every time you stepped out the door.
Speaker 1: Were you recruited by gangs at all in those days?  Did they try to recruit you?
Speaker 2: Not really recruitment.  I was, one day, when I was in eighth grade [at DuSable Upper Grade Center, Chicago, Illinois], I convinced my mother to let me stay outside after dark.  You know, usually I was in before dark but, you know, I was in eighth grade now, big eighth grade, so I said, I want to stay out after dark.  So, she said, okay, now, but be careful, this and that.  So I stayed out after dark and I lived in a red building.  So we were playing, we were playing basketball, playing baseball, whatever, then it got dark, and then they said, okay let's go.  I said, go, where we going?  They said, come on, get something.  So everybody started picking up sticks, picking up bottles and bricks.  I said, "What's up?"  They said, "We're going down to the white buildings and fight with them boys."  I said, "Why we doing that?  Why?"  They said, "Come on, what, you a punk?  You scared?"  And I said, "Why are we going to fight with them boys in the white building?"  Said, "'Cause they live in the white building."  Now, I said, that's the last time I stayed out.  I said, no, no.  So, and those are my friends who, I mean, you know, in school, whoever was in school, I mean I had friends who lived in the white buildings but at dark, this mentality came over the young men and they had to engage in this kind of behavior which I didn't understand.  Now, no one ever said to me, you gotta come with us or you better or, so one ever said that but I just wouldn't do it.  I couldn't do it.
Speaker 1: What you describe is almost like 'Lord of the Flies,' that William Golding book, where these kids end up on an island and--
Speaker 2: Well you--
Speaker 1: No supervision you're describing--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and no guidance.
Speaker 2: The kids, and that's an accurate description.  That's the beginning of young people making their own rules.  When it was no longer the adults telling the young people what to do, the young people started telling adults, this is what we're going to do, and this is how we're going to do it, this is when we're going to do it.  That was the beginning, and then doing it en masse.  That's the beginning of these street gangs taking over communities.
Speaker 1: Now, now were the, did you, can you give us, or did you come along at a time when some of these gangs were being formed or, you know, I know some grew from social clubs really to gangs and, I don't know, I mean, on State [Street], in Stateway [Gardens, Chicago, Illinois], who is, what is the major gang over there when you were--
Speaker 2: Well, I came along in the, I left the Robert Taylors [Robert Taylor Homes, Chicago, Illinois] in the '66 [1966], '67 [1967].
Speaker 1: You were in high, you weren't graduated yet but you were in the middle of high school, I guess?
Speaker 2: No, I, at the beginning of high school.  I was at the beginning.  I hadn't graduated.  So, what was happening on the gang front, the Blackstone Rangers were starting to rear up and that was the big thing and as, and nature has it that usually when something here's created, then something over there's created.  So while the Rangers were coming up, then the Disciples were coming up, simultaneous, and those became the two big gangs, especially on the South Side [Chicago, Illinois].  Of course, on the West Side [Chicago, Illinois], they had the Vice Lords and, I believe, the Cobras, so, so we were at the, in the, not at the very beginning because some people say the very beginning was the early '60s [1960s] or even the early, the late '50s [1950s] with the Egyptian Cobras and the Vice Lords, but we were in it.
Speaker 1: You were actually right in the heyday of it in Chicago [Illinois], I think, the way it was growing, from what I've heard.
Speaker 2: We were in it and then by the time I got to, graduating from high school at '69 [1969], I graduated in '69 [1969], that was it.  It was on at that point.  That was, that was the beginning of it.  That's when people started opening fire.  That's when people started shooting and shunt, it was on at that point.  So, earlier, you know, you, earlier, what they would call something rough, is when two guys would get into a fight with their hands and after the fight was over, they were friends.  I mean, that, which is, you know, well, wow, young guys today, they can't understand that.  You mean you fought with the guy, he beat you and you didn't go home and get the gat and shoot him in the head?  Well, no, you know, we fought and we were friends.  That's the era that I was coming off of.  By the time I got to '69 [1969], it was, if you fight me and you beat me, now I'm gonna get my boys and we coming back for you.  That was where we were at that time.  And then, from there, that's when all hell broke loose, as you know, that's when young people started dying.
Story_ID: 226220
Speaker 1: Now were there any teachers or, in school, or mentors in the neighborhood that gave you some guidance or some particular attention?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: So nobody?
Speaker 2: (Laughter)  No.  I mean, I mean I, look--
Speaker 1: You see, the story is supposed to be that some, somebody in the conversation.
Speaker 2: Well, let's do it this way then.  There was a science teacher, Mr. Staples [ph.], who's dead now, who, and he didn't do anything special, he was just a good teacher.  The one thing special he did, when school was over in eighth grade [DuSable Upper Grade Center, Chicago, Illinois], he invited us, and we lived in public housing, he invited us into his house, and he lived in the eighties, in the good neighborhood.  Man, you know, for us, and we rode the bus on up to the good neighborhood, we looked out the windows and man, they got grass up here, real grass.  And he invited us into his house and that was only a one day thing.  It was kind of a, kind of a, you know, a thank you.  He said you were in my class, my science class, you guys did okay, and that was it.  Now, that was it.  There was no, I mean, no Boy Scouts [of America], no baseball, no, there was nothing.  There were basically young black men left to their own devices and they figured it out and they said, we gonna rumble, we gonna shoot, we gonna, and that was it.
Speaker 1: No boys clubs and nothing like that (unclear).
Speaker 2: No boys clubs, it was nothing.  There were young black--
Speaker 1: Now, what, now, at one time now, tell me what your experience is with this 'cause I know, at one time and, there were like, there was like skating, sock hops, swimming, lot of things over in Stateway Gardens [Chicago, Illinois] and in Robert Taylor [Homes, Chicago, Illinois], when it first opened.
Speaker 2: Uh-hum.
Speaker 1: That's what I've heard and there were programs with--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --staff and, you know, and before the, some of the, some of the people who started exploiting the federal money got involved and started hiring people that didn't show up for these jobs and--
Speaker 2: Uh-hum.
Speaker 1: --that sort of thing, but I heard at one time there were, but when you were, I think at 51st [Street] and Federal [Avenue], there was a center, you know, for Robert Taylor but I, with a gym and all that, you know, it was there, Olives [ph.] lasted in 1980, a long time ago, but I saw it at one point, but, was that, that wasn't functional then?
Speaker 2: Nope, it wasn't.  When you see, when we moved in public housing and for many years, they didn't plan for it properly.  They didn't have the schools so they had to build schools all over the place.  They didn't have social services, agencies or support so they had to find social services and bring them in.  They didn't have recreation.  They didn't, it wasn't there.  Recreation for us was going out and killing the grass, and killing the trees.  That was recreation.  That's what we did.  It was nothing else to do.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think the, the one, the center I'm talking about, even in the '80s [1980s] was being run by Saint, it's an African saint, I mean it's a church name for an African saint--
Speaker 2: Saint Charles Lwanga [Church, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Yeah, Saint Charles Lwanga ran that center--
Speaker 2: Uh-hum.
Speaker 1: --at that time.  Ms. Stanley [ph.] ran that--
Speaker 2: Right, and that was over on 55th Street there--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and they had to come over but inside, you see, when you plan a community, especially for certain kinds of people, you gotta plan the whole thing.  You can't just throw the people in the community and that's basically what had happened to us with my Robert Taylor experience.  Thous--tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of people, maybe not that many, in all total, I believe, at its largest point, public housing in Chicago [Illinois] had about 150,000 people in it but you just can't throw all these low income people, not just black people, any people together, leave the children to their own devices, don't give the mothers support, ban the men from the community, and then you expect it to work.  It didn't work.  It was a cataclysmic disaster.
Story_ID: 226221
Speaker 1: Tell me about the end of grade school.  Now, where did you decide to go to high school?  Or did you have a, was there any decision that you could make about that, at that point?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I ended up, first of all, I was the salutatorian of my elementary school, DuSable Upper Grade Center [Chicago, Illinois] which, you know, wasn't, you know, and we had, oh, in my graduating class, there were like nine hundred people.  So, you know, you know, a lot of people said, wow, you know, you the man, you know, you're the salutatorian and I didn't really feel that way but, you know, I was the number two guy out of a large class but I saw what they were doing to the other kids, you know, and it was no big thing for me, you know, and, you know, and from there a lot of people said, oh, you're going to do great.  You're one of the ones who are going to make it.
Speaker 1: So this is 1965?
Speaker 2: Yes, I graduated, yes, from high school, nineteen, from elementary school--
Speaker 1: Elementary, yeah.
Speaker 2: --in 1965.
Speaker 1: So did you go on to DuSable [High School, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: I started at DuSable, started at DuSable.  First day in DuSable, I got my, they, man, and it happens at most schools, they threw me up against the wall in the bathroom, took me, it happened, you know.  I'm not saying that DuSable was any better or worse than any other high school but I didn't last at DuSable and I'm not saying it was because of me or whatever, but I didn't last, you know.  You see, in situations like that, you gotta make people, children have to make decisions, and my decision was, okay, now, which way am I gonna roll?  I see what the game is here.  If I'm gonna succeed in this environment, I'm going to have to change my game.  Do I want to change my game, which is, you know, doing, trying to do well in school, being, you know, halfway decent, halfway smart, and I really didn't want to change my game.  Now, that's not to say that I couldn't have stayed at DuSable and maybe done okay, but the supports weren't there at that time for a person like me.  I mean, you know, I wasn't, you know, I was still slightly, kind of smallish, and, you know, who knows what would have happened or how I would have ended up and I say this, so I went to Hirsch [Metropolitan] High School [Chicago, Illinois].  I transferred early in the semester to Hirsch High School out on 77th [Street] Street and Hirsch High School, and you know, honestly, it had its strong points and its weak points because the gang thing, as we had talked about, was really starting to get hot about that time, '65 [1965], '66 [1966].
Speaker 1: Was it hot at Hirsch too?
Speaker 2: It was hot everywhere on the South Side [Chicago, Illinois], I mean, you know, the Blackstone [Rangers] was coming out of Hyde Park High School [Hyde Park Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois] and the Disciples were coming out of Englewood [Chicago, Illinois] and they're merging, had all these other schools--
Story_ID: 226222
Speaker 1: Was the neighborhood around Hirsch [Metropolitan High School, Chicago, Illinois], that'd be Grand Crossing [Chicago, Illinois] neighborhood.  Is that--
Speaker 2: That was Stones [Blackstone Rangers], at that time.
Speaker 1: Okay, so the population, I guess, is mostly black around Hirsch at this point?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, absolute--
Speaker 1: At one time it was a Jewish high school.
Speaker 2: That is correct, Emil G. Hirsch, yeah, that is correct, but it had changed.  Grand Crossing had changed, Avalon [Chicago, Illinois] had changed, all those neighborhoods.
Speaker 1: Those neighborhoods were in the process of changing, I guess.  South Shore [Chicago, Illinois] was still Jewish.
Speaker 2: South Shore was, at that time.
Speaker 1: So east of you was still, still Jewish and--
Speaker 2: East of Stony Island [Avenue] was, at that time, at that time, and also west of Ashland [Avenue], actually, west of Halsted [Street] was still pretty white at that time too--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --that was in the Calumet school district, and that was more west of Racine [Avenue].
Speaker 1: So, housing segregation and restrictive covenants were breaking up, you know.
Speaker 2: That is correct.
Speaker 1: Black folks were moving further south and further west and east.
Speaker 2: It was, it was similar to the Great Migration of blacks coming from the South to cities like Chicago [Illinois], Detroit [Michigan], et cetera and now a second wave of migration of blacks from the inner city public housing, much of it, of Chicago, into the other communities as those restrictive covenants and that de facto segregation of housing started to break up.  So, yes, and that's how we, that's how, how I moved eventually to Ash--Auburn, Auburn Gresham [Chicago, Illinois], to 76th [Street] and Morgan [Avenue] and--
Speaker 1: So, did the family move there?  I mean--
Speaker 2: The fam--my father [Stewart Dine Jackson] and my stepmother [Carolyn Barren (ph.)] moved there.  We moved out.  We were in Robert Taylors [Robert Taylor Homes, Chicago, Illinois for four, four years and we--
Speaker 1: So you all did make a transition to get out?
Speaker 2: And we made a transition and we got out of, we made a transition and we got out.  My father, and let's call it what it is, when the boys started robbing my father (laughter), he said, I'm not saying that it was okay that they was robbing me, but it was getting bad.  Everybody, anybody who was there you, that was it, but my father had gotten robbed a couple of times and he said, this is not good.  Thank you, I've been trying to tell you this is not good.  So, we left.
Story_ID: 226223
Speaker 1: I was asking you about church, I believe it was, and you said that church was a big part of your life growing up.
Speaker 2: It was a big part of my life growing up.
Speaker 1: What church was it?  What church did you--
Speaker 2: Churches.
Speaker 1: Churches, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was never at one particular church, I was, I was at many different churches but the first church that I went to was a Mennonite church, Bethel Mennonite [Community] Church [Chicago, Illinois], which is on 13th [Street], near Ashland [Avenue], in the middle of public housing in the ABLA Homes [Chicago, Illinois], and my big remembrance of that church is that they used to have a vacation bible school and they also had a summer camp, Camp La Habra [ph.] and another camp and that's where they would take the kids for a week, out of the city, and we would go swimming, canoeing, hiking, and that was great.  It was great to get away from the bricks and from the lights in the city.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Other churches, the United Presbyterian Church of Altgeld Gardens [sic. United Church of Altgeld Gardens, Chicago, Illinois], I spent a lot of time there and again, vacation bible school.  I did a lot of summers of vacation bible school there.  That's a church that is affiliated with my Aunt Mildred Dozier [Mildred Elizabeth Freeney Dozier], and Altgeld Gardens [Homes, Chicago, Illinois], it's right across from block one, which is where I was born in Altgeld Gardens.  So I would go there a lot, became friends with a lot of the young people who attended the church and did a lot of things socially with them as well.  So, that was good.  I went to St. James Methodist Church [Chicago, Illinois].  It's, it's different now.  It was St. James Methodist on 46th [Street] and Ellis [Avenue].  It's another kind of church now but the building is still there and it's a regal church.  That was the first, basically, all non-black church that I went to.  It was actually more of a white church and, you know.
Speaker 1: So the Mennonites and the Presbyterians were black, all black?
Speaker 2: Yes, mostly black, mostly black.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so I went to St. James Methodist, I left there and went to Coppin's [Coppin AME Church, Chicago, Illinois], Coppin's AME Church and I didn't, you know, I went to Sunday school there, I went to a few church services, but I really became involved in church at saint, St. James AME Church, I'm sorry, St. Mary's AME Church [Chicago, Illinois] on 52nd [Street] and Dearborn [Avenue], and that's where I joined the choir and, and studied the catechism and did, you know, lots of church activities, went on field trips and, of course, participated in services, did there, and other churches but, so, I'm somewhat steeped in church, especially in my younger years.  My older years I did older, you know, after twenty, I started drifting away.  Went to Catholic church, to St. George's [St. George Catholic Church, Chicago, Illinois], for a while.  Went to some services at St. Ann's [ph.] but, I've been to a few churches--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and have been associated or members.
Speaker 1: So when you, so when you were growing up, I mean, church offered some kind of a, you know, programs.  I mean, the programs are missing from the community, I guess, some other activities--
Speaker 2: Yeah, it provided me a social environment where I could meet kids who were different than the ones who wanted to go down and beat up the boys in the white building.
Story_ID: 226224
Speaker 1: Now, was music a big part of growing up?
Speaker 2: No, no.  Outside of singing in church, I didn't sing much and I didn't play an instrument but I danced a lot when I was younger.  We would, you know, at the family parties, whenever we would have a family outing, dancing was a huge thing.  Everybody danced or we would eat first and then later they had turned on the record players and they'd pull out the 45s and the kids would dance and everyone would clap.  So I danced when I was young.
Speaker 1: Who were some of your favorite artists in growing up?
Speaker 2: Well, when I was younger, people liked The Contours.  They did a song, I believe, called 'Do You Love Me' but then as I grew into it, I just grew into the typical stuff.  The Miracles, The Temptations, of course, The Four Tops and Motown, well Motown, of course, everybody did Motown.  And then the Philly [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], the Philly sound came and then, of course, out of Memphis [Tennessee] they had Rufus--
Speaker 1: Thomas.
Speaker 2: Rufus Thomas and others coming out.  So, and there was not much coming off the West Coast that we, at that time.  There was a little bit coming out of Houston [Texas], Archie Bell & the Drells, those were the days, but--
Speaker 1: He let everybody know too.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  Oh, yes, he did, he represented--
Speaker 1: Archie Bell from Houston, Texas.
Speaker 2: --he represented.  So, but, so it was the standard guys when I was coming up and then, but musically, I really got into music.  I started giving huge parties, the precursor to what you, I think, might call it jam productions.  There were some nights when I, and I had a group of people with me, this was in the late '60s [1960s] and early '70s [1970s] when we would give two, three parties a night, same night, all over the City of Chicago [Illinois], different parties, you know, three, four hundred people at one party, four, five hundred people at another and--
Speaker 1: So you would like rent a hall or something or--
Speaker 2: Yes, we were entrepreneurs, we were promoters of entertainment.  Hired deejays, get security, you needed security.  As I said, this was a time when the gangs started, becoming a lot more prevalent.
Story_ID: 226225
Speaker 1: I've heard in Chicago [Illinois], people in your age group were either Gousters or Ivy Leaguers.  Were you in either one of those?
Speaker 2: Well, I used to pretend I was an Ivy Leaguer but I didn't have the money to be an Ivy Leaguer.  In order to be an Ivy Leaguer, you needed to have Brooks Brothers, Brooks Brothers shirts, and you used to have Brooks Brothers shoes and, or Stacy Adams and I didn't have that kind of money.  Gousters, I believe the Gousters were wearing the alpaca sweaters and so forth and, you know, and they were a little bit more relaxed and I wasn't either.  I was a wannabe.  I was a wannabe, you know, tried to be a wannabe middle class guy and I really, really never was, couldn't afford the kind of things that it took to be a real Ivy Leaguer but that's my answer.
Story_ID: 226226
Speaker 1: Now at Hirsch [Metropolitan] High School [Chicago, Illinois] now, did you, what was that like?  How was it different from DuSable [High School, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Well, the violence wasn't there.  It was a far cry, I had to ride the bus for, you know, forty-five minutes to an hour every day to get there versus simply walking three blocks from my house to DuSable.  The teachers at Hirsch, even though, even there no one pulled me aside and said, you know, I'm going to take care of you, they were, I think they were a little bit different.  I don't think that they were as stressed as the teachers at DuSable and so that, that helped there.  So, there was a difference in environment.  You know, people called Hirsch, at that time, it's a good school, you're going to the good school versus DuSable and there was really nothing wrong with DuSable, the school, and I don't think there's anything wrong with DuSable the school today, it was the fact that adults refused to do their jobs.  That included the teachers, that included the parents, that included the elected officials who were in charge, people refused to do their jobs, which were to make those children, like me and like the others, feel safe and secure and to help them learn.  So that was the problem and, to a certain degree, that's the problem today in many schools.
Speaker 1: Okay, so what did you focus on in high school in terms of subject matter?  Were you still involved with math primarily?  Did you like math the best?
Speaker 2: Well, actually, I got waylaid in high school.  I started working and I started working as a, basically as a, my late, in my freshman year and I started working, started making a little money and so at that point school wasn't nearly as important to me because, because I had come from, you know, an environment that was somewhat deprived where I couldn't get things that a lot of, I saw other kids getting and so when I got my own job, that's when I became a wannabe Ivy Leaguer and that's when I started buying the kind of shirts that I thought Ivy Leaguers should wear and that other kids would be impressed with.  And so I was concentrating less on my grades and more on material things.
Story_ID: 226227
Speaker 1: When you graduated [from Hirsch Metropolitan High School, Chicago, Illinois], did you have prospects of going to college?
Speaker 2: Well, when I graduated, this was at the height of the Vietnam War and when I graduated, it was almost a foregone conclusion that I was going to go to Vietnam.  All my other friends were doing it.  Some were joining the [U.S.] military, others were being drafted into the military.  We had lottery numbers.  I had a relatively low lottery number and people said, "Phil [HistoryMaker Phillip Jackson], they got your number."  So it was a foregone conclusion.  So, I graduated and I registered for college, which kept you out of the service, the fact that you were, you got a college deferment.  So I was in the, I was at the University of Illinois at Chicago [Chicago, Illinois] and I didn't last very long at the University of Illinois at Chicago because my preparation to go there was not what it should have been and it was the same for most of the young black kids who were entered with me and who came from the various high schools throughout Chicago [Illinois] at that time.  And so we had close to a, I would imagine, close to a 50 percent attrition rate of young black kids in that first year at the University of Illinois at Chicago and I was one of them and so I was back on the streets and back, at that time, I had moved back with my grandmother [Ella Freeney], immediately after high school, you know.  I was very happy and thankful for my time with my father [Stewart Dine Jackson] but I moved back with my grandmother on 43rd Street.  So when I flunked out of college at the University of Illinois, I was back on 43rd Street and I was back with the boys, standing on the corners.
Speaker 1: Now when you moved in with your grandmother, was it because you thought you could have more freedom there or something?
Speaker 2: I did.  I, yeah, the household that I lived in was more structured than with my grandmother and, that was good for me when I was younger.  And I don't know if it would have continued to have been good for me and then we were actually at a point where my stepmother [Carolyn Barren (ph.)] was saying, okay, it's time, it's time, you gotta go and, you know, and she encouraged me to do lots of different things but staying there was not one of 'em.  So, so I went back with my grandmother and I started flowing and I flowed and I flowed through my first year of college where I dropped out.  Then I flowed into the neighborhood, you know, where I started, you know, getting with the guys and doing what the guys do, you know, what the guys do.  A little bit of this and a little bit of that.  The same things that we were doing, the guys, it's what, it's what has gotten American jails and prisons full of young black men.  I did those same kind of things.  The same kind of things that they got black men in jail for today.  Sixty, 70 percent in certain states full of young black men.  I did the same kind of things.  It is almost only by the grace of God that I, you know, didn't end up in jail.  Some of the things that I did, could have gotten me in jail and that's why, when I look at young black men today, especially even the ones who are incarcerated, I look at 'em and I go, there's no difference between that black man and me.  He got caught, that's the biggest difference.  I'm doing, you know, some of the same things.  He got caught, he's in jail.  And so, here in the State of Illinois, where I believe 3 percent of the state's population are young black men between the ages of eighteen and thirty, 60 percent of the prison population are young black men between eighteen and thirty and I asked, how can that be?  How can 3 percent of the state's population make up 60 percent of the state's prison population?  And there are no good answers to that.  The problem is, there are not even people asking the question.  Well I'm asking the question because all those young black men in these prisons are not bad.  Now I don't think that they're all angels, but I see how this system manufactures criminality in young black men.  It is, it is a created commodity.  I mean, these young black men, they don't have a choice.  They don't have a chance.  I was there.  I saw them.  They, it could have happened to me.
Story_ID: 226228
Speaker 1: So, right now, I'm working to reverse it.  I'm working to make sure it doesn't happen to these young guys (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Now what happened to you to prevent you from being one of these statistical, one of these guys in jail?  You know, one of these young men in jail?
Speaker 1: Well, I had an epiphany.  It came to me one night when I was on 43rd Street [Chicago, Illinois], drinking Wild Irish Rose.  I don't know if anyone has ever really drank Wild Irish Rose but we were throwing it back and, you know, and I was new to the game and I said, man, it's going down, at first it was a little rough, then it starts going down real easy.
Speaker 2: So you didn't drink until after high school [Hirsch Metropolitan High School, Chicago, Illinois], I guess?
Speaker 1: That is correct.  I didn't drink until after high school, until I got back, until I flunked out of college [University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, Illinois] actually, which was a whole another thing.  That's when I, you know, I got almost depressed, defeated.  That's when I said, this is not my world, this world ain't for me, it's for the, it's for them white kids down at the University of Illinois.  I mean, they, it's their game.  So I went back to 43rd Street and I just started running with the boys on 43rd Street and making it a point to do what they did.  I said, if you all do that, I'm doing it.
Speaker 2: Now what happened to change your direction?  I mean, what, so you were drinking this Wild Irish Rose, you said, all right?
Speaker 1: (Laughter)  Yeah.
Speaker 2: A brick of a Wild Irish Rose, I would guess, you know.
Speaker 1: A what?
Speaker 2: A brick (unclear), it's like a--
Speaker 1: Oh, more, everybody was wired that night, everybody had theirs and so we were putting it down and I thought, I said, I can handle this and I'm thinking, and drink, you know, anyone who drinks Wild Irish Rose knows it makes you somewhat of a philosopher.  And I said, I'm thinking and talking, said, yeah, we can, wow, we can do this and yeah, and I got all kind of ideas, all kind of great thoughts going through my mind with this Wild Irish Rose and, you know, and then I'm thinking, I said, I'm a wino, I'm a wino, standing on a corner, drinking wine, cheap wine, and then, and then that night, that night, for those of us who've been here before, I started throwing up like you ain't, like nobody's business.  I threw up everything, whatever.  You know I threw up, I said, oh, there goes my stomach.  Oh, that looks like my liver.  Everything came up and then when there was nothin' else, and then, you know, for those of us who've been there, I was on the toilet all night, not on the toilet, my face in the toilet, all night, with the dry heaves, just, chu-chu, over and over and over.  And I started to think, can my life be better than this?  I started, I said, you know, maybe this isn't such a great life.  Maybe I can do something different and then I thought I said, you know what, those kids at the University of Illinois, they weren't that smart, maybe I can change something that I was doing there.  You know, all this is over some Wild Irish Rose and I'm, and finally I woke up that morning on the floor, next to the toilet, I was a changed man at that point.  So at that point, I went back to school and I was, it was a whole new ballgame.  It was, I provided my own structure at that point.  I said, nope, I don't need structure, I don't need nobody telling me what to do, I'm going to do it.  And I started going to school.  I started taking, taking, I said, give me your hardest classes, whatever.  I started at Malcolm X [College, Chicago, Illinois], went over to Olive-Harvey [College, Chicago, Illinois], you know, 'cause I didn't have no money.  So I went to all those schools, I said, give me your hardest classes, whatever they are, I don't care.  I took all the tough classes and this and that and then went down, got a scholarship, you know, from doing well.  I was taking massive loads.  I was taking 21, 24, once, one semester, I took thirty semester hours.  And what that meant was, I had to go to school in the morning, and I took a load, I went home, took a nap, came back in the early evening, took another load.  So I took a double load that one night, that one semester, a double load, thirty hours.  I got nine A's and one B and I, it was on from there.  I said, phew, these boys ain't got nothing on me.  I said, I can do this.  From there, I graduated, went to Roosevelt University [Chicago, Illinois].  Same kind of deal.  I said, bring it on, where's your tough stuff and so forth.  And I studied lots of different things.  I studied history.  I was on scholarships so I would study as much history as I could and then when I got close to getting a degree, I changed my major.  Then I went into literature and I studied as much literature as I could, got close to a degree, I changed my major.  I went into geography.  Studied all the, studied geology, meteorology, then I'd get up there, gotta change my major.  And then I studied African studies and African history and said, got close to taking a degree, I changed my major.  They came to me and said, we gonna throw you out of school because your scholarship, your money is running out.  They said, pick a major and then they said, and then you already got enough hours to graduate, just pick a major, take some courses, graduate and get the heck out of dodge.  So then I choose philosophy.  I said, okay.  I choose philosophy, got through it, you know, did my thing there, then I was out, and then they kind of threw me out because, you know, I was on scholarship, wasn't paying and they said, "[HistoryMaker] Phillip [Jackson], you're going to have to declare a major and get out of Dodge."  And that's what I did.  And so I graduated from Roosevelt University.
Story_ID: 226229
Speaker 1: So you went to University of Illinois [at Chicago, Chicago, Illinois], Olive-Harvey [College, Chicago, Illinois], Malcolm X [College, Chicago, Illinois] and you came out of Roosevelt [University, Chicago, Illinois], in what year?
Speaker 2: Seventy-four [1974].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Now I actually started grad school too.  I attended the National College of Education which is now National Louis University [Chicago, Illinois] but I went there, I actually, I did graduate work in philosophy at Roosevelt and I did work in education at National Louis college, so I do have some hours in graduate school.
Speaker 1: Okay, so what did you do after Roosevelt?  Or before we leave all that education, were there any teachers at all that made an impression on you?  Or did, took an interest in you?
Speaker 2: Yes, there was one gentleman at Roosevelt, there were two, actually, at Roosevelt University.  One is Helen Painter [ph.], she was my mentor in education.  She was the one who inspired me and who even guides me today.  She's in her nineties.  She's a little white lady in Evanston, Illinois today and she was my mentor at Roosevelt University who made me understand how important the practice theory in the field of education is as a body of knowledge.  The other guy was Dennis Rohatyn.  He was a little Jewish genius boy in philosophy.  He became a professor when he was twenty-one with his Ph.D.  I, he was a Ph.D. at twenty-one, I think I was twenty-two, so he was younger than me and I was taking courses from him and I said, God, he's got a Ph.D. in philosophy and he's twenty-one and that kind of inspired me.  And he helped me on my thinking processes.  He was ruthless, he was not kind, he didn't spare my feelings.  Whenever I produced a paper or if I were to produce a theory that didn't hold water or that didn't carry, he would say, "[HistoryMaker] Phillip [Jackson], this is faulty reasoning, faulty logic, doesn't carry through, won't fly in my class, sorry, bye."  And I, you know, at first, you know, I said, ah, why doesn't he give me a break.  He didn't give me any breaks.  And so, he taught me that whatever you do, it has to be perfect, for him.  Now, I'm not that way, myself.  You don't have to be perfect but he taught me, or that was the beginning of my brand of excellence that I carry with me wherever I go.  And I've carried it with me on jobs, to schools, to Tai chi, I do, to relationships, this thing called, excellence, which is not being perfect but putting all that you have in it so that you can get all that you can out of it.  And, you know, a lot of people say, "Well that means just doing the best you can do."  No, that's not what I'm talking about.  Doing the best you can do is not good enough.  My brand of excellence is, you got to make a way.  You've got to find a way no matter what the issue is, no matter what the problem is, you have got to solve it.  I mean, you know, some people say, well, we can't fix this.  No, you can't fix it.  That doesn't mean I can't.  And so while all I need you to do is to step away and let me get at it and I will find a way to fix it.  And so that's, it's that kind of attitude or that's where I got that kind of attitude coming up through philosophy and through Dennis Rohatyn.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, when you were in school, black studies movement was, was, had cranked up as something new and was going on.  Were you a part of any of the black student, student activities here in the city 'cause I know at one time they formed a coalition or something and, did you, were you a part of any of that?
Speaker 2: Yes I was.  And I did my black studies, a lot of it with a gentlemen who a lot of people know, his name is Charles [J.] Evans.  He was out at Olive-Harvey [College, Chicago, Illinois] with that movement out there and he was a, what I think is a nationally renowned expert in the area of African and, African American studies.  So, I did a lot of work with Mr. Evans and I did my first work with Mr. Evans but from there I picked it up on my own and continued to study, especially, African, Africans throughout the diaspora, especially on the continent of Africa and some of the great movements in African American history and it culminated with my introduction to the Honorable Marcus Mosiah Garvey [Jr.] and I looked at what he tried to accomplish with the Universal Negro Improvement Association [UNIA], his Negro Factories League [sic. Negro Factories Corporation], his Black Star Line and all the other things, structures, that he tried to put in place in order to uplift African people throughout the world.  I also looked at how he was beat down, how he was betrayed by black people and I've learned a lot.  So I'm actually, I consider myself putting a lot of his principles and practices in place around this issue of educating black children.
Story_ID: 226230
Speaker 1: How did you get introduced to Marcus Mosiah Garvey and his work, and did you know any of the old-time Garveyites who were around in those days?
Speaker 2: Well, I was, through my African American studies, Mr. Garvey was always on the periphery, and through my U.S. studies, American history studies, he was kind of a villain, you know, which, which I didn't kind of really understand.  So, I didn't really delve into him.  I believe it was Shaka [Rawls] who introduced me to the UNIA [Universal Negro Improvement Association] here in Chicago [Illinois] and I got a chance to go to a few of the meetings and to hear, and to do a couple of things, to hear and to see UNIA.  From there, I read some of the secondary sources on Garvey, you know, what people are saying about Garvey and about the movement and I read 'em and they were okay and there was a kind of excitement there, but I said, no, let me read what Garvey says, and that's when I went to the philosophy and opinions, myself, and I, you know, and I started reading, you know, the primary source.  I said, wow, then who is this man?  This man is crazy.  He's not afraid.  This man is crazy.  He believes he can do what he's saying.  You know, this is reminiscent of me and my grandfather [Dock Freeney].  In fact, there are people like my grandfather, and like others, who may have mentioned Marcus Garvey to me because they lived through that period and, you know, I didn't have the frame of reference but once I started reading Garvey and then, then actually seeing what he had accomplished, and then seeing how he had given way to other great movements after his movement, including the Honorable Elijah Muhammad who, I believe, was greatly influenced by what Marcus Garvey did.  I said, man, this may be the most dynamic personality in black history that I've ever read about, and this is after reading about all the great kingdoms of Africa, Songhai, Mali, Timbuktu, you know, about, you know, reading, about all the great black people in the United States of America's history, from Crispus Attucks to Frederick Douglass to George Washington Carver, Booker T. [Washington], you know, to current day leaders, Malcolm X who I kind of knew, Stokely Carmichael, Kwame Ture, all these, even the Black Panthers [Black Panther Party], of that time, George Johnson [sic. George Jackson], Huey [P. Newton], Eldridge [Cleaver], Ange-- I looked at all these guys and I said, but this Marcus Garvey, this man is different.  He's different from all these guys, all these guys who I, who I, I said, this man is different.  [Reverend] Dr. Martin Luther King [Jr.], he was different.  Marcus Garvey was different than all those guys.
Speaker 1: Well what was his, what was the major difference?
Speaker 2: The difference is, and this is what I love, Marcus Garvey didn't ask nobody for permission.  You see, black people, we stay waitin' for permission to excel, to succeed, to live lives of quality, to, to educate our children.  We're not going to do it until we get permission to do it but what we don't realize is, permission ain't coming.  Nobody's going to give you permission to educate your children and so we play it off by saying, well, you know, the system is supposed to educate our children.  Well you know, we can't do it because we don't have the money.  All those are excuses that Marcus Garvey did not take and that's what just enamored me with him, I mean, that drew me to his spirit.  I mean, he built empires, structures.  He had an army, as we know.  You know, that scared the heck out of people.  Who are all these black men marching down, you know, in New York [New York] and, you know, through Harlem [New York, New York], in uniform?  How did he get an army?  I mean, that's scary and that's something that I believe and we know the role of J. Edgar Hoover and all this, they couldn't accept that.  Today, in the same way, it's like, the system can't accept strong, bold, courageous, you know, black men who don't owe nobody nothing.  You know, if you owe us or if you're obligated to us, then, you know, we'll let you play the game but for you to be out there, on your own, not beholden to anybody, that's an image that we can't let black people see.  Well, that's what Marcus Garvey meant to me and that's where I get a lot of my inspiration--
Story_ID: 226231
Speaker 1: You know, as you know, I've worked on a lot of jobs and working on a job is a wonderful thing but Malcolm X didn't work for nobody.  [Reverend] Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] never worked for nobody and Marcus Garvey didn't work for nobody and that's what inspired me to say, phew, how do I look working for anybody?  People say, well you can make a lot of money.  You know, I'm not in it for money, I'm in it to accomplish something different and, by the way, I don't want to compare myself to those guys, however, they're great models and we need to look at that.  We need, we need to be teaching our young people to look at guys like Marcus Garvey and say, this is who you should strive to be like.  Our children don't even, they don't even know who Marcus Garvey is.  Children today, coming out of high school, they haven't, they've never heard of Marcus Garvey.  They wouldn't know Marcus Garvey from Neiman Marcus at this point, and that's our fault.
Story_ID: 226232
Speaker 1: All that being said, now, I'm going to ask a question that seems contradictory, but where'd you get your first job after you get out of college [Roosevelt University, Chicago, Illinois] (laughter).
Speaker 2: I was already working.  I was working at Kroch's and Brentano's [Chicago, Illinois], the bookstore where I was a stock boy, working in the stockroom, packing books.  And so when I graduated from college, I went to the job and I went into the stockroom.  Now, and there was a gentleman, his name was Ray Carroll, wonderful guy who was kind of an angel for me.  He's in business, as you well know, and probably in government, you need an angel.  You need somebody who's going to say, this is my guy, don't mess with my guy.  You mess with my guy, you mess with me.  Well, Ray Carroll became my angel, a white guy.  You know, and--
Speaker 1: Now what was he in terms of Kroch's?
Speaker 2: He was a vice president in charge of paperback buying and I worked in the stockroom in paperbacks and when I graduated from high school [Hirsch Metropolitan High School, Chicago, Illinois], he came to me and he said, "[HistoryMaker] Phillip [Jackson], you know you got to come out the stockroom," when I graduated from college.  He came to me and he said, "Phillip, you know you got to come out the stockroom."  And I said, "No I don't, I'm perfectly comfortable."  I said, "Aren't I doing a good job in the stockroom?"  He said, "Yeah, but you have a college degree," and I was a little bit afraid, even with all the experiences that I had in colleges, all the successes--
Speaker 1: Now what, what did you, what had you projected as your, as a career coming out of Roosevelt with a degree in philosophy.  Did you think that you would teach it or--
Speaker 2: That's what I thought.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was going to go get a master's [degree] and a Ph.D. in philosophy and end up in academia teaching children, teaching students, like Dennis Rohatyn had taught me.  I thought that that was the coolest thing, I thought.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, so Ray Carroll tried to get you to advance in Kroch's and Brentano's executive--
Speaker 2: Well, no, just to get me out of the stockroom.  He said, "Why don't you at least work on the sales floor."  And so I was a little bit afraid but I took it up as a thing and then I worked on the sales floor for a few months and he says, "Why don't you try working in the office."  So then I worked in the office and I kept, and he says, "Well, why don't you try working in buying."  And so I tried working in buying, became an, and he said, "Now, why don't you try working as a manager," and on and on and on and he nurtured me and groomed me up to the point of my being senior vice president of operations at Kroch's and Brentano's.  You know, after a point, you know, I had basically surpassed his position after a point, you know, but he was always supportive, nurturing, for lack of a better word, he was non-racial.  He didn't look at me as a black student or a black young boy or a black man, he looked at me as a person who had some potential who, that if he nurtured it, it could flourish and that's what it did.  I became vice president of operations for the store.  It was, at that time, it was about a $40 million company, senior vice president of operations, and I was in charge of all stores.  I was in charge of all the store operations, building the stores, all the employees, all the, you know, a lot of the, all the what they call the operational stuff.  The stuff that makes the company go.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so I did that.
Speaker 1: How long were you in Kroch's?
Speaker 2: Oh, I was at Kroch's for twenty-three years.  I was at Kroch's for twenty-three years.
Story_ID: 226233
Speaker 1: I actually left Kroch's [and Brentano's, Chicago, Illinois] on a lawsuit.  I sued the company because they, the company started to disenfranchise what I thought were the old employees, they were a lot older than me.  I'm talking about these are people in their sixties, seventies and eighties, and at that time, I was in, I was in my early forties and they were, they were starting to release them and to downsize 'em and we had what they call an ESOP, an employee stock ownership plan, and I said, you know, we can't just let go of our older employees, and they looked at me and said, what?  Did anyone put a nickel in you?  And I said, well wait a minute, these people have been with this company for 20, 30, 40 years and we can't just put them out on the streets.  And they said, [HistoryMaker] Phillip [Jackson], you don't understand.  You don't understand business.  Now, I built the company.  You don't understand business, you don't understand this, you don't understand that, I said, look, you really shouldn't put these people out on the streets.  They said, no, no, no, this is not your decision, they told me, and from that point I said, okay, all right, and I filed a class action lawsuit against them on behalf of the older employees in the company.  Mostly, they were older white people.  I mean, they weren't, it wasn't, I mean it wasn't for me, it was for them because many of them had their whole lives tied up in the company.  And I said, you can't just do this to these people.  So that was really one of the first times that I took a major stand like that and I was afraid.  I mean, you put, I put everything on the line.  First of all, I put my job on the line.  I mean, you know, they told me, in fact in some of the negotiations with the lawyers, they said, Phillip, what's your number?  I said, what, they said how much is it going to cost us to buy out this lawsuit?  What is it going to take from you?  I said, what do you mean?  They said, what is your number?  Tell us how much so we can get rid of this.  I said, well what about the employees?  They said, we can't help them but we can help you.  Then that's when I figured out, even though I had been in business, that's when I figured out how the game was played.  I said, you mean, if I give you a number, take the money, walk away, then I get the money and then you can do what you do to these people?  They said, that's it.  I said, there is no number.  Treat these people right and then the lawsuit goes away and they said, you fool, see you in court.  And so, what I did, I had to leave the company, no job after that, you know, because you don't sue a company and then stick around and play kissy face.  It got vicious.  They started character assassination on me.  They spread rumors about how I had been trying to destroy the company and all this.  I mean, my own family, they would read about this in the newspaper and say, Phillip, you didn't do this did you?  You're a bad man.  I go, wait a minute.  So, but, that's when I first, I learned how to play hardball, I mean, and it was crushing to have built this company and then to be attacked by the company, to be viciously attacked by the company.  So, but I, I hung in there, I hung in there, I kept the lawsuit alive with a string.  Finally a, what they call a white knight pursuit company came in, they wanted to buy Kroch's and they said, well, we want to buy Kroch's and Brentano's, dadada.  The only way they could buy it, the company's owner said, we'll buy Kroch's but we will not buy your lawsuit which, obviously, is a smart thing to do because that lawsuit follows the chain of ownership.  And they said, okay, get rid of the lawsuit.  So then Kroch's had to come back to me after all this viciousness and they had to say, hello Mr. Jackson, can we do anything to help you?  And I, I hung up the phone.  And they kept coming, and they said, look, we really want to settle this.  What will it take for you to settle this lawsuit?  I said, the only thing that's going to make me settle this lawsuit is for you to make those people whole.  It's not about me, it's about them.  And eventually they negotiated with me, with them, with the class and we negotiated it for 50 percent on the dollar of settlement where they were down to pennies on the dollar.  They were down to two cents on a dollar before I came back in and we did the final negotiations and cut the deal.  And I do have to say, that's where I also learned, it's all about the Benjamins [currency].  So then I was getting ready, you know, sign the final papers and then I told them, I said my hand's cramping up.  They said, Phillip, don't be joking, just sign.  I said I can't sign it.  They said, well Phillip what's wrong with your hand?  I said, I can't sign it.  They said, why not?  I said, you don't know the hurt and the pain that I've been through.  You don't know the humiliation and they said, well, what's going to make you feel better?  I said, and they said, okay, and they wrote down another number.  No, that ain't going to, and so, I had to negotiate my own side deal with their deal.  You know, it wasn't about me now, but let's be honest, my respect was on the line.  So finally, we cut all the deals and I honestly have to say the lawyers made out like bandits.  They got, everybody got paid up first, all the law firms, this and that. Then my people got paid, all my people got paid.  It's about seventy people, older people, and then I got paid, so, that was it.  So, I learned a little bit there and then I was onto my next one.
Story_ID: 226234
Speaker 1: Well, that's a big story about Kroch's and Brentano's [Chicago, Illinois], but, where did you go next?  Well, what happened next?
Speaker 2: Went to the City of Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Office of Budget and Management [OBM], where I, where I got connected with names like Paul Vallas, who some people know.  He was the, he was the budget director at that time and I was the assistant budget director, no I wasn't assistant, I was just a budget analyst at that time but that's where I learned that it's all about the Benjamins [currency] too.  It's all about the money.  So I, but I went to, the Office of Budget and Management, that's where the dollars are, that's where the dollars are controlled.  So, so I went there and I worked in the Office of Budget and Management.  I worked there for a year.  I worked with Paul, started working, that was my connection to the elected officials.  I started working with all the, all the aldermen and I--
Speaker 1: Now, wait a minute, let me backtrack a little bit now.  Usually in Chicago, it's your connection with the elected officials, it leads to a job.
Speaker 2: That is correct.
Speaker 1: So if you're saying a job led to the connection?
Speaker 2: That is correct.
Speaker 1: So, how could this be in Chicago?   This is--
Speaker 2: That was correct.  It was absolutely reversed.  In Chicago, as they say, they say who you know.  Well I didn't know nobody.  I came in, and you got to be careful.
Speaker 1: Now, let me ask this though.  Were you on boards of, when you were at Kroch's and you were, you know, in senior management at Kroch's, were you on boards of directors of different--
Speaker 2: Well, my biggest board that I was on at, when I was at Kroch's and Brentano's was, the board, the Lay Board [of Trustees] for Hales Franciscan High School [Chicago, Illinois] and that's the high school that was being closed.  I don't know if you remember.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's right.  Catholic school--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --in the middle of the South Side [Chicago, Illinois], I mean, in the heart of the South Side.
Speaker 2: In the 49th [Street], the heart of South Side, wonderful school that was being closed.  And so, I went in and I said, what's up with this?  And they said, well, they're going to close.  I said, but what's the deal?  And they said, well, we don't have the money and we don't have this and I said, but isn't this school educating all these young black men?  They said, well yeah, but you know, I said, well, why don't we do, why don't we do something?  They said, there's nothin' we can do.  They're going to close the school.  And I said, no, no, no, let's, no, no, no.  There is something we can do.  So I joined the board of Hales Franciscan.  And so we, you know, you know, and boy, they said, nope.  They said, school closed.  They said, we've already started locking up the doors, boarding up the windows.  And I said, no, no, don't do that yet, you know.  They said, no, the school is closed.  So I started meeting with a small group, small board, and we were meetin' every night, trying to save Hales.  We'd meet and meet and meet.  So finally, we actually got the head of the Franciscan Order, his name was Father Karras [ph.], he, out of Brazil.  We were making so much noise and doing so much, that we got the head of the Franciscan Order to fly in from Brazil.
Story_ID: 226235
Speaker 1: And they flew in and then we negotiated a little bit more and the Archdiocese [of Chicago] here in Chicago [Illinois] said, "Man, leave them guys alone."  They said, you know, "The school was going to close, Hales [Franciscan High School, Chicago, Illinois] is going to close," this and that, and so finally we had, what they called a big meeting, the big meeting.  The big meeting was when all the guys from the archdiocese, the Catholic schools, Father Karras [ph.], his guys, you know, who came with him, all his lieutenants, or whatever, I'm not a big Catholic so I don't know all the Catholic stuff, but when I looked at the room, I said, "Okay, so this is the deal room.  This is the deal."  So they threw down the deal.  They said, "Look, all right, y'all can keep this school but these are our conditions."  They said, "Number one, you're going to have to put some cash up."  I said, okay.  And then we had a guy, his name was Ron Hubert [Donald Hubert], was our cash guy at that time, he was the lawyer, is a lawyer now, a criminal defense lawyer here in Chicago, he had graduated from Hales, he dipped into his pocket and he leveraged us.  So he pulled out a couple of hundred thousands, boom.  Said, okay, stake you and they said, okay.  And then they said, "And then you're going to have to get your enrollment up."  So, okay.  And then they said, "And we want to see your financial plan going forward for the next five years."  And they said, "Okay, when do we need it by?"  They said, "We need it tomorrow" (laughter).  And, everybody said, "Ah, it's like that, ah.  So now, so now you're trying to, you know, you're going to play it like that."  They said you know, and then they stopped, so the guy said, "Well look, let's meet again tomorrow, you guys bring your stuff, bring the this, bring the check, and then we'll call it what it is."  And then so had a meeting that night.  I said, okay, all right, I said okay y'all, let's do this.  They said, "We ain't, what's to do?"  I said, "Well you know, we've got to get busy.  You know, they said, that we've got to have the money, we've got to have student, we've got to have enrollment, we've got to have our plan, let's get busy."  They said, "Don't you see them busters, they playin' us.  They ain't going to give us the school, they just wanna, they just want us to go through this.  They got us to do all this stuff and they ain't going to give us the school."  I said, "Well come on.  Let's just do it.  Let's do what they said and then let's put it back on them."  My people said, "No, it's on them."  They said, "We ain't gonna do it."  I said, oh, man.  So I went home that night, it was about eight o'clock that night, the next meeting was at nine o'clock the next morning, and we didn't have a plan, we didn't have a plan at all.  We didn't have nothing.  So I said, okay, let me go back to my college days where I was in college doing them all-nighters.  Got out my calculator, starting running them numbers, you know, and I just stayed up all night, did a plan, all night.  Nine o'clock in the morning, I walked in, my eyes are like this.  We in the room and everybody said, oh, man, okay, and then they said, okay, you guys, they said, "Where's your plan?"  I said, "There's the plan."  They looked at it they said, "Damn, damn, that's a pretty good plan."  And then my people, they didn't, they hadn't even seen it, from Hales, my people, and they said, "Oh yeah, yeah, it's a good plan, you know, we've been working."  I said, "Yeah we've been working on it."  And we gave them the plan and they said, you got the school.  That was it, and Hales is open today.  So, but so that was, you asked me if I was on any boards.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that was it.
Speaker 1: I was on, I was on that board and I guess after that experience, I said, I don't need too many more boards.  No, I didn't do that.  I've been on other boards.
Speaker 2: When was that?  When was that when the crisis hit now?
Speaker 1: That was when Hales was going to close.  I think it was in '91 [1991] or '92 [1992], whenever Hales was going to close (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I think you're right, yeah, I think you're right.
Story_ID: 226236
Speaker 1: This action with Kroch's [and Brentano's, Chicago, Illinois], this transition to city government was around '95 [1995], right?
Speaker 2: Ninety-three [1993].
Speaker 1: Ninety-three [1993]?
Speaker 2: I think it was '93 [1993] I left Kroch's and '94 [1994] I started with the City of Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 1: Okay, now did you know Paul Vallas before you got over there?
Speaker 2: Didn't know him.
Speaker 1: Or Gery Chico--
Speaker 2: Didn't know him.
Speaker 1: -or any of those guys?
Speaker 2: Didn't know him.  Didn't know any of those guys.
Speaker 1: There's a new administration that, we didn't talk about the [Mayor] Harold Washington years or any of that, but--
Speaker 2: Oh, no, sorry.
Speaker 1: --I don't know if you want, if you have anything to say about that, but--
Speaker 2: No, I didn't, I didn't really work that close with Mayor Washington.  You know, I was, I was basically on the business side.  I was running business, I was running Kroch's, I was building stores.  What I knew about Mayor Washington, he was one of the best customers at Kroch's and Brentano's.  He was in there all the time.  He would come in with his security details, go around through all the sections.  He, I mean, he was, he was an amazing, an amazingly educated person, knowledgeable about so many, and, you know, I saw him first-handed, and that, that for me was a model as well because I'm still in my formulative years but this man knew about everything.  The way that he articulated it, as we well know, the, his thought processes, so all that's teaching me but I did not work for him, I was in private sector at that time.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I saw him frequently, in Kroch's and Brentano's, because wherever knowledge and education was, that's where Mayor Washington was.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you're like 31, 32 when he was elected, I guess?
Speaker 2: Yes sir.
Speaker 1: Eighty-three [1983].
Speaker 2: Yes sir.
Speaker 1: Right, okay.  Well, the, it's the [Mayor Richard M.] Daley administration 1994 and you're in OMB [sic, OBM, City of Chicago, Office of Budget and Management], so what happened?
Speaker 2: Well, I, I came in at OMB through a friend, a friend.  What happened was, Mr. Vallas ran into a few dollars, and as you, if you know a budget director, you know they do run into a few dollars.  They're directed, you know, a city's budget $4 or $5 billion.  Well, he needed someone to work with the various city agencies to coordinate human service programs and he kept trying his guys, you know, the other finance guys.  You know, a finance guy is great but he would say to him, he says, help me out here.  We got this extra money, it's Fed [federal government] money, it's got to be encumbered by this date otherwise they're going to sweep it back to Washington [D.C.] so I need this and he said and we want to roll out something that's going to make a big impact, the mayor wants some big impact programs.  He doesn't want to do same old, same old.  So he kept telling his guys, but these are finance people.  I don't know if you know, finance people are, I mean they're good, they're great at finance but in terms of operations and programs, you know, no.  So nobody really could do it.  And so, he brought me in for an interview.  Somebody told him, they said, "Paul, if you want to get all, everything that you just said, I know a guy who can do it."  Paul said, bring me the guy.  So I went in, I interviewed with Mr. Vallas and Mr. Vallas never looked at me during the whole interview and, you know, and I said well, sir, I can do this and this and (unclear) he said, you know, I don't know.  He said, "I don't have totally good feelings about this, but I'm going to hire you anyway."  I said, ain't that about, I said--under my breath--I ain't got good feelings but I'm going to work for you anyway. So but we, and that was the beginning of our relationship.
Story_ID: 226237
Speaker 1: What he [Paul Vallas] found out is, and you can, you probably see my Dennis Rohatyn training coming out of Roosevelt [University, Chicago, Illinois] and coming out of Kroch's and Brentano's [Chicago, Illinois] where I was the operations guy, I were the go to guy.  Anything that came my way, I had to get it done.  The buck stopped here.  So all of a sudden, he starts throwing programs at me saying, we need this program, we need that one, boom, boom, boom, and it'd come to me, four hours later, he's got it back.  And he, I don't know, he thought it was a fluke.  He said, okay, here's another one.  He'd get it to me, four hours later, boom, he's got it back.  He said wait a minute, what about this and that?  He had given me another one, sometimes it might take a couple of days, two days later, (noise) that.  So everything he'd throw my way, (noise), he'd get a response back, you know, in a way that he had never gotten before out of anyone who had worked for him.  So he said, and he started liking it.  So he said, well do this, this and this, and I'd give it, and I'd do this and I threw it back at him, he said, oh, that's good.  Well, do this, this and this.  And then I was, so all of a sudden, and the other thing about me was, I was new to the hall, to city hall.  Anyone who works in a city hall knows that it's a kind of a different environment but I was in city hall and I was playing fast and loose.  See, I didn't, I wasn't hooked up like these other guys.  Everybody was hooked up, you know, or sponsored but, and I wasn't.  I, man, I was out there, I said, let's do the deal and people would tell me, no, man, you need to slow down.  I said, no, we gotta get this done.  They said, no, you don't understand, you know, this, and I said, nope, boom.  And so, what was happening is, if it would come out, I was treating this thing like it was private sector.  I was being entrepreneurial.  I'm saying, okay, let's work it, let's get it done and all of a sudden, the programs that I would work, wherever I worked, government was different at that point from, they'd say, well this ain't the way that usually government works.  Government is usually slow, usually calculating, doing this, that wasn't me and people kept saying, boy, you're gonna get yourself in trouble, you gonna, whatever.  I said, well then, let me get in trouble.  And so I'm doing my government thing and then people started noticing.  They said, wow, you know, there's a little action over on that side of the table.  Who's over on that, and people would say, oh, that, who's that guy?  [HistoryMaker] Phillip [Jackson] who?  And, you know, and so a few people heard about me and finally, you know, in a way it is, you know, people started hearing about me.  So Mr. Chico, Gery Chico, heard about me and, you know, and I started sending reports his way because he asked for them.  He said, well what's happening here?  And then, Mr. Chico, and I want to thank him, he passed on information about me to the mayor.  He said, there's a new kid and there's a new gun in town, this Phil Jackson kid and, you know, he's different.  And so, and I want to thank Mayor [Richard M.] Daley for acknowledging, not just acknowledge me, but realizing there is a new gun in town and he is different, you know, and it's Phil Jackson so let's see.  Let's give him some rope.  See how much boy, see how much he can run.  So from there, in '95 [1995], I was on the team that went over to the Chicago Public Schools [CPS].  A lot of names that you know.  A lot of great people who came out of that.  The mayor was at the front of it, though--
Story_ID: 226238
Speaker 1: All right, well, '95 [1995] you went over to Chicago Public Schools [CPS] and tell us what happened there (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, it, the mayor [Mayor Richard M. Daley] put me on the team.  The mayor, he looked through city hall and he got what he felt were some of the best and brightest people who were in his administration and he sent them over to 1819 Pershing Road [Chicago, Illinois] to reengineer one of the worst, big city school systems in the country, and that was, at that time, the Chicago Public Schools.  And I was on a team and we hit the ground running.
Speaker 1: So you were part of Paul Vallas' team, you know?
Speaker 2: That is correct.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Gery Chico, Paul Vallas, Diane Minor, Ken Gotsch, Ben Reyes, it was a, it was a powerful team, some of the top commissioners, top deputies in the City of Chicago.  We, and the reason why is because the Chicago Public Schools is a major bureaucracy.  It is actually the largest employer, I believe, in the State of Illinois with about 46,000 employees.  I mean, it's huge, as you might know.  Close to a $4 billion budget, 650 schools, 630 schools at this time.  And so he, it took almost another city administration to manage the Chicago Public Schools and he entrusted that team, and me, with that position.  So, I do want to take a note at this point to say that Mayor Daley gave me chances that he didn't have to give me.  He gave me a chance, once I was at city hall, in the budget office [City of Chicago, Office of Budget and Management], he gave me his support.  He gave me his support over at the Chicago Public Schools.  There, I actually became director of intergovernmental affairs which is where I started interfacing with elected officials all over the country.  It was amazing for anybody to have that kind of an opportunity and it was me.  And then I became chief of staff at the Chicago Public Schools managing, you know, basically, the number two guy or the chief operations guy under Paul Vallas, managing, basically, the system while Mr. Vallas was pretty much the face of the system.  Then he gave me another opportunity as the CEO of the Chicago Housing Authority [CHA] managing, basically, my own little private $600 million agency with about 4500 employees and managing a small city of, I think at the top, 130,000 people.  So--
Speaker 1: Now you were on something though that, excuse me, but in that position, you were in a position to manage something that a lot of people had, well it had been targeted to be phased out, actually, almost at that point, hadn't it?  Or they started phasing some of the CHA.
Speaker 2: What they told me is, many people told me, "[HistoryMaker] Phillip [Jackson], don't go to CHA.  It's a career buster.  You go to CHA, the game is over."
Speaker 1: Well, let's look back at the trail now.  Poor [HistoryMaker] Renault Robinson had been there, right, at one point, I mean, and in that respect, it's, he's poor Renault Robinson because he didn't fare well there.
Speaker 2: Well, everybody who had gone to CHA--
Speaker 1: He was a hero, he was a hero otherwise and then he goes--
Speaker 2: Vince Lane [HistoryMaker Vincent Lane].
Speaker 1: Vince Lane, yeah.
Speaker 2: Oh, people who went to CHA, who headed up, who took that job, basically, they, many of them didn't do well.
Speaker 1: Renault Robinson has told us, basically, they've just soured him on government, being associated with them.  Just, he didn't want to--
Speaker 2: Well, well CHA was a cesspool but it was a, and I guess one of the proudest things that I am is that I didn't get caught up in it and the reason why is, I was always focused on the people and a lot of people, they misunderstand me even today.  They go, Phillip, you messed up at CHA.  You should have done this, no, no, no.  My eye was always on the prize and the prize for me were the people who lived in public housing.  Now, that was an understanding that the mayor and I had in his picking me.  I knew what I had to do as a job.  He knew what I was interested in going over there.  So, I mean, we were clear, and there were a lot of people who weren't clear.  There are a lot of people who had other motives and ulterior motives and what, but not me.  My issue were the people who lived in public housing and the reason why they were my issue, I was one of 'em.  I was born there, I lived there, I knew, I know what my people were going through and they needed somebody.  They needed somebody brave.  They needed somebody who was not afraid to take on the world for them.
Story_ID: 226239
Speaker 1: Now what was your plan for CHA [Chicago Housing Authority]?  What did you, did you think it was going to be around for a while or did you think it was going to be phased out?
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: How did you?
Speaker 2: It had, CHA had to go, absolutely.  It had to go.  CHA was destroying more black people than it helped.  It had to go, and not just black people, but all people, but most of the people who lived in the high-rise public housing, are black people, and it was destroying them.  It was destroying generations.  It was destroying families.  You know, one of my people, a woman, who lived in CHA, she said, "Why would I leave this good house.  She said my heat is good, my rent is low, why would I leave it?"  I said, "Because your son was killed here, two years ago.  Your daughter is pregnant with three children and she has no future except staying here, that's why you must leave."  And so in a sense, in a sense, I became a Moses for, for people in public housing.  I was going to lead my people to the, the promise land.  Now, a lot of people didn't like that.  I'm talking about black people.  They said, what, what is he doing?  I mean, who is he to decide that black people can do better?  Who is he?  Who is he to decide that black people don't have to live in these situations, and these are black people who are telling me and I'm getting all these comments from people.  Now, there are a lot of white people who are cheering.  They're saying, finally, there's someone who, who seems to be incorruptible, who seems to have the interest of these people at heart, finally, there's somebody who's going to step up.  And so, my first year at CHA, I did some good work over at CPS [Chicago Public Schools].  I worked for Mr. [Gery] Chico, for the mayor [Mayor Richard M. Daley], for the mayor first, for Mr. Chico second and then for Paul Vallas.  Those were my three bosses.  So I did some good work and they acknowledged me.  In fact, the mayor gave me the ultimate acknowledgement.  He said, he told me, he said, "[HistoryMaker] Phillip [Jackson], you don't need to be a number two, you need to be a CEO."  That, when the mayor of the number two city or one of the greatest cities in the world tells you that, that makes you think.  It was kind of like when I was at CH--at Kroch's and Brentano's [Chicago, Illinois] when my boss Ray Carroll said, "Phillip, come on out the stockroom."  He says, "You don't need to be in the stockroom, come work on the sales floor," and from that point, you know.  So when the mayor said to me, Phillip, you don't need to be working for somebody else, you need to be calling the shots.  I said, I said, okay, I'll call.  So that's when I went in and that's when I undertook this mission at CHA and the first year of my being at CHA was an amazing success.  It literally, it set the tone for some of what you see today and some of what you see that say not, but it set the tone.  We were everywhere.  First of all, we had to convince the people who lived in CHA that their lives could be different.  Now that was an amazingly hard thing to do, to make people who had lived a certain way for 30, 40, 50 years, to make them believe, no, your life can be different, and then I had to go outside.  I had to convince the people who lived outside of CHA, don't be afraid of these people who live in CHA because they're going to come live with you.
Story_ID: 226240
Speaker 1: I just wanted to explain, or maybe just get us onto, maybe to explain what the dynamic was that, if CHA [Chicago Housing Authority] was being shut down, you know, many people in the community were concerned about where people would go who lived at CHA.  The concern was that there's not enough public housing or affordable housing in the city [Chicago, Illinois] so these people can have a place to live as an alternative to CHA 'cause I think the idea was to take a voucher, right?
Speaker 2: A housing choice voucher.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and that--
Speaker 2: Section Eight [Housing Choice Voucher Program].
Speaker 1: Yeah, but the concern there wasn't enough, you'd have the voucher but there wasn't enough Section Eight housing approved in the city to meet the demand for all the people that had a voucher.  That was what, the concerns were being expressed as, so what happened?  How did you resolve that?  I mean, or is it being resolved?
Speaker 2: Yeah, and the design of the plan, and I was one of the key players in what they called this [The] Plan for Transformation.  The Plan for Transformation, as I designed it, was a plan to transform people's lives.  It wasn't about real estate.  It wasn't about buildings, taking down buildings, building new buildings and architecture and stuff like, it was about people's lives, The Plan for Transformation.  And so the way that I designed The Plan for Transformation, it was to reach into people's lives and to find the magic to reengineer their lives so that you could take a person who had lived in public housing for 20, 30 years, and make them able to live in greater society.  Now this is an amazingly difficult thing to do.  Most of the people who lived in public housing were afraid, the people lived in public housing, they were afraid to do it.  The people who lived outside of public housing, they were afraid to do it and just as you said--
Speaker 1: The people who lived outside were afraid of the people in public housing.
Speaker 2: They were afraid of the people who lived in public housing.  They did not want that project mentality coming to their neighborhoods, to their school, and I understood all that, and I was right in the middle of it.  I was in the storm's eye on this one.  And so my job, and I spent, I worked, you know, I work hard now, but I was working seven days a week, twenty hours a day, I was everywhere, working with the people outside of public housing, in public housing, in Washington, D.C., at HUD [U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development], meeting with the elected officials here, Springfield [Illinois], everywhere, trying to coordinate this, this master plan to change public housing for the people who lived in public housing.  Now, for me, what the end game looked like, it didn't look like everybody who lived in public housing was going to move into South Shore [Chicago, Illinois] or move into, on the North Side or move anywhere.
Speaker 1: Rogers Park [Chicago, Illinois] or anywhere.
Speaker 2: Rogers Park or move anywhere.  I met, I met with Alderman Joe Moore and his people up there.  I met, I was everywhere.  The end game for me was making these people who lived in public housing able to choose a situation where they could live and succeed.  That was the end game.  So, so it wasn't about where are the housing units.  Is, are there enough houses in Chicago [Illinois] to house all the people who live in public housing?  Are there enough houses on, in Rosen or on the South Side?  The end game was, can we produce people who can thrive in the year 1999, 2000, that's when I was there, can we produce people who can make it anywhere?
Speaker 1: Well how did you approach that problem?  Did you, were there training, a training component or something to this?
Speaker 2: The way I approached the problem was, with me, I got to a point where I told the people in public housing, and a lot of people said, Phil [HistoryMaker Phillip Jackson], that's why you're not there today.  It doesn't matter, I left on my terms.  I told them I said, when you leave public housing and you go out here in the world, you're representing me.  And they said, what are you talking about?  I said, you're representing me.  You're not just representing you, you're representing everybody in CHA.  And so if you go into a community and if you don't cut your grass or you don't mow your lawn or you don't, you know, dispose of your garbage right, they're going to say, see, we told you about them, public housing people.  And so I said, it's my job to make sure that wherever you go, that you're going to make sure you're working with the schools, that you're working with the city services, that you are as good or a better neighbor than anyone else in that community.  And they said, well what if we decide that we don't want to be that way.  And I told them, I'm not letting you out of public housing.  They said, what, this is jail?  And I said, I'm not letting you out.  I won't let you leave public housing until you know and I know that you're ready to go out into this world and succeed.  You can't leave.  Now I'm being a little facetious because you can't, you know, I, I didn't, there were no bars and we didn't hold guns on people, but what I did do, we engaged in building a, the capacity to succeed, whether it's employment, whether it's being able to navigate the social service systems, whether it's connecting to drug rehabilitation, whether it's connecting to the various interventions that are necessary that support services, that are necessary.  We were teaching people who had lived in this situation for 20, 30, 40 years, how to live in the world and that was a big part of my deal--
Story_ID: 226241
Speaker 1: The other part of the deal was getting the money to do this and that's where we negotiated with the federal government in Washington, D.C., who really weren't, I mean, they weren't really, you know, engaged with this whole idea of transforming public housing.  Now, there were national policies that were afoot, that they did put out, such as this drive for the Section Eight policy [Housing Choice Voucher Program], for the housing choice vouchers that you mentioned, that's a federal policy and what the policy read is that wherever it is cheaper to give a housing choice voucher, than to rehabilitate a hard unit of public housing, then it is mandated that you give a housing choice voucher.  And as you well know, most of the units of public housing, high-rise public housing in Chicago [Illinois], were so dilapidated that it would have taken, you know, a billion dollars, a hundred, several tens of billions of dollars to get this housing stuff back to where it's in decent condition and once you got it back there, you were still going to have high-rise public housing.  And so this was a grand experiment that we're still in right now.  And Terry Peterson, who's the commissioner, the CEO of CHA [Chicago Housing Authority] now and a good friend of mine, he is still engaged in the throes of that experiment, not, he's had a lot of success, I would say at this point.  He's had some setbacks, as well.  Now, a setback, in my opinion is, always, my opinion, you gotta, for me, it was, it always is people first.  So, a lot of people say that some of the people in public housing aren't doing as well outside of public housing, that they haven't gotten the supports, that they haven't gotten the, the, you know, the kind of help that they needed in order to successfully make the transition.  Well, this thing that we call the transformation of public housing in the United States, and this is happening all over the country now, so this isn't just Chicago that we're talking about, it is absolutely not painless.  There are some people who are going to suffer and I knew that going in.  I knew that this was not going to be all peaches and cream, that somebody had to pay, had to bite the bullet.  And the last thing I wanted to do was make the people who would suffer the most, poor black people, and so I struggled with that and I struggled not to do that and that's one reason I worked as hard as I did during my time there.  However, I did the deals, I changed the perception of public housing, I brought the money back, $1.6 billion from Washington, I ran a good first leg and I got out of town.  I mean, I got out of that position.

Speaker 1: The mayor, and I want to go back to the mayor again, the mayor of Chicago [Illinois], Mayor Richard [M.] Daley, he was so enamored with the jobs that I had done in the budget office [City of Chicago Office of Budget and Management], in the Chicago Public Schools [CPS] and then at CHA [Chicago Housing Authority], that he created a position for me as chief for education for the City of Chicago, for the whole City of Chicago, working with schools and education.  It was more of a policy position throughout the whole City of Chicago, and, you know, it was a great job.  I mean, everybody, you know, everywhere I went, people would say, ah, Phil [HistoryMaker Phillip Jackson], you know, chief for education, City, Mayor Daley, City, and it was great, but that's not what I wanted to do with my life.  I, as you well know, I was a, am an action guy.  I'm an operations guy, I'm a make something happen guy so I went to the mayor and I said, "Mister Mayor, I gotta go."  And he said, "Phillip, whatever you want, whatever you want to do."  I said, "Thank you, I gotta go.  I don't want to work with City anymore."  And the mayor said, "Whatever you want to do, any place, any department, you, tell me."  He said, "Do you need me to make a phone call?  Do you want," I said, "no, Mister Mayor, I just want to go," and I left the city.
Speaker 2: Well what was your plan?  What was next?
Speaker 1: My plan, I went to the Boys & Girls Clubs [of America] just, you know, to begin my exit strategy from the City.  It was a, you know, good job and whatever and I went there and I worked there.
Speaker 2: So what did you do for Boys & Girls Clubs?
Speaker 1: I was the CEO of the Boys & Girls Clubs of Chicago.  Decent job, extremely good pay and which I miss but, you know, I, that was not what I wanted to do.  I didn't want to work for anybody else, for anybody else so, including being a CEO of Boys & Girls Clubs.  I'm not interested in that.  So I left there and that's when I started, in earnest, started working with The Black Star Project [Chicago, Illinois] and that's the project that I'm, that's my job today.
Story_ID: 226243
Speaker 1: Okay, now what is [The] Black Star Project [Chicago, Illinois]?  Now the name, you know, harkens, back, was again to Marcus Garvey, the Black Star Line, I know was his steamship line that he created.
Speaker 2: Most people don't know that.  Now they hear Black Star Project and they have no reference for that allusion to the Black Star Line and that's, that's precisely where it comes from.  And then there are some people who do know that name and they go, you can't call yourself The Black Star Project.  And I go, what's wrong?  You don't understand, that's that back to Africa man.  That's that militant man, you know, nobody's going to think of you seriously if you call yourself Black Star.  White people are going to be afraid of you.  I said, what are you talking about?  And so I called it The Black Star Project and I made it based on Marcus Garvey.  I saw the structure that he was trying to build.  Now, let's be honest.  Marcus Garvey was put in jail for trying to do what he tried to do.  They put him in jail, convicted him, expelled him from the country, sent him over, you know, they did all that because he tried to create a structure for black people.  And I saw that and I said, that's the answer.  The answer is not, it's not another great leader.  I mean, a lot of people talk.  A lot of people give these great orations, oratory speeches and, you know, as anyone affiliated with UNIA [Universal Negro Improvement Association] know that Marcus Garvey was one of the best at speaking and anyone associated with UNIA was excelling in oratory because that was a part of that movement but they were also more than any movement that I've seen for black people in the world, they were for structure, for system, for organization and that's what I saw.
Speaker 1: It seems that, I just want to make this comment here, I hope it's appropriate but when we interviewed [HistoryMaker] Dorothy Height, who just received the Congressional Gold Medal, you know, this past year, the former head of the National Council of Negro Women [NCNW], she said that when she volunteered at Harlem [New York, New York] as a college student, she said the most organized and professional organization she ever was around was the Universal Negro Improvement Association, which also was the largest black organization in the world in those days and still remains the largest one we've ever had.
Speaker 2: Uh-hm.
Speaker 1: So a lot of people don't know that but I, but she said that and it surprised me too.  I thought she might say NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] or something, she said, no, that was the most professional, not, you know, organization she ever worked for.
Speaker 2: And you see, that's, thank you for bringing that up.  That's what Black Star is seeking to become.  We don't want to be the largest.  We're not interested in trying to impress people.  We want to be professional and we want to have structure and we want to have discipline and we want to get results, that's all we're interested in.  And so a lot of people say, well, why don't you go get funded from this or why don't, we're not interested in funding from this or that.  We want to accomplish an objective and it is through structure and organization and discipline that we have found that you do that and we get that directly from Marcus Garvey, absolute.  There was not a better general or a mastermind or architect for, for orchestrating people that I know of and throughout of much of human history, and we've studied a lot of human history, and that's what I'm so ashamed to say, that black people today refuse to understand.  It's not that they can't understand it or that they don't understand it, they refuse to understand, that until we become organized, structured, and systematic and disciplined, we are always going to be, just like Marcus Garvey said, we're going to be at the bottom of the heap for people throughout the world and it's manifested itself.  Black children today are being destroyed in the public schools in America.  They're being flat out, absolutely, destroyed with the permission of black people.  With the tacit and explicit permission of black people, destroy our children and it's mostly for lack of structure, for lack of an organization, for lack of a system.  Black people are so enamored with voice.  If a person talks good, then we follow that person.  If a person looks good, I'm going to follow him because I think he's cute, that's where we have come to and you, those who know Marcus Garvey know that he was hated because he was dark-skinned and that he had large features, a large nose, he was hated by many black people and we never respected that.  Well, I learned from it and that's the way, that's a direction that Black Star is going in--
Story_ID: 226244
Speaker 1: Now, [The] Black Star [Project, Chicago, Illinois] is the largest organization that we know of like this in the country that is working solely on educating black children and getting black parents involved in the education of their children and rallying the black community around this thing that we call education and the reason why is, unless black children are educated, we have no hope for the rest of mankind, for the rest of mankind, unless black children can get a better education than what they're getting in the year 2004, which is today, our children have no chance, our race has no chance of ever succeeding in this world, ever.  You can talk about all the other movements, and there are other movements out there trying to do things with black people, there are political movements, there are economic movements, and those are good movements, and I acknowledge them, but unless we can educate black children, black people may as well leave the planet right now, forget it.  There is, there will be no place for black people on this earth and right now, right now as you and I speak, black people are being systematically phased out, eliminated, their relevance, their importance is of such that we are not needed on this planet and it is our leaders who are complicit in this.  They're the ones who are telling us, complain, protest, argue, get violent, they're wrong.  The real solution is, get educated, get technologically proficient, connect with great educational ideas from all over the world that are starting to push things forward, and that's the real answer.  Your, I have not heard that anywhere in the, from, and we, whether it's in Africa, whether it's in Europe, whether it's in the Caribbean, whether it's in America, the only place that I started to begin to hear that was with Marcus Mosiah Garvey.
Story_ID: 226245
Speaker 1: Well we've had, of course, Booker T. Washington, [Marcus] Garvey movement, the, you've had Leon Sullivan's OIC [Opportunities Industrialization Centers], to some extent, and as a matter of self-help, the Nation of Islam, but the, you see from what I've read of what, I've read about the Black Star Program [sic. The Black Star Project, Chicago, Illinois] is that you see that the, the principal crisis in our community is in the home, right, and so the education you're talking about is a cultural education or orientation rather than just education in the school, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Is that what you're saying?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I'm not, you see, that's where my service at CHA [Chicago Housing Authority] does, does me well.  I'm talking about a communal education.  I'm not talking about what's happening in those bricks down at the corner, that they call a school.  What, what statisticians have done, they've measured the real impact of going into the bricks, that they call a school, and they say that less than 50 percent of what we call real education actually occurs in those bricks.  And so my issue is not that.  What is the greater, this real thing that we call education, where does it happen?  It happens in the home.  It happens with the interaction between the parents and the child.  It happens when the family comes together.  Just like I told you, when my family came together, we all danced.  Man, we got the best dancing family in the world because that's what our family value was.  In our community, the value was on what kind of clothes you have, how you talk, how you look, how you wear your hair.  And so, I'm talking about reengineering a whole value system of education in the community that will force the schools to deliver a whole different quality and kind of education to our students and by matching up those two things, that's when black people will start to rise.  Now, there, now I'm not just shooting in the dark here.  There are concrete examples of what I'm saying happening, such as Native Americans in this country, they used to be in a position that blacks are in today.  Native Americans used to be at the absolute, rock bottom of the American education system for various reasons because their families have broken down, as you say, because their communities have broken down, they call them reservations or their indigenous Native American communities have broken down and their children couldn't be educated.  When they started coming back together, and a lot of it, and being accurate, some of it is related to the economics of the casinos being on the reservations, on the, they call them reservations, but the Native Americans actually being able to control their economics, pairing that with a new desire for educational excellence, it lifted Native Americans up above blacks and Latinos in many educational measures.  Native American children are doing better than black and Latino children.
Story_ID: 226246
Speaker 1: --The last point that we finished is, and Latinos have done the same thing.  They've elevated themselves using that same formula of economics and education, working in partnership, to elevate themselves to a point, where now, in education and economics, the only people who are on the bottom in America, are black people, by race.  Sure, there are a few poor whites and there are some poor Latinos, but in large, the only people who are being left behind in America, because we refuse to either learn or embrace this philosophy of education and economics working in tandem, are black people, and until we learn that, as I said earlier, Marcus Garvey will be right.  We are going to be the doormat of the universe.
Story_ID: 226247
Speaker 1: How do you plan to reach people with a message of cultural transformation without, I mean, the schools, whatever message they are putting out or not putting out, they have access to the kids, you know, so many hours of the day 'cause they have to go to school, now how do you or, how do you plan to reach black people with, with your message?
Speaker 2: We're going to do what everybody says can't be done, that is we're going to reach the parents and a lot, everybody says, [HistoryMaker] Phillip [Jackson], it's a waste of time.  Phillip, there's not that much money in the world.  Phillip, the parents don't care.
Speaker 1: Well, one thing they might say is, where are the parents 'cause a lot of them they can't find them.
Speaker 2: That's, they don't care.
Speaker 1: They're not at home or they're in jail or something or--
Speaker 2: All of that, and--
Speaker 1: --dead.
Speaker 2: --as we, you and I, we talked about earlier, you talked about earlier, a man like Marcus Garvey or the Honorable Elijah Muhammad, they could take people who others might consider the dregs of society and they could talk to 'em in such a way, they can bring them into an organization, bring 'em into a structure and they could make those people achieve beyond anyone's wildest dreams because it wasn't really the man and it wasn't really the conversation, it is more the structure where you see yourself in the, in the whole.  Well, that's what we're doing.  We're building a structure of parental involvement for parents, for parents who have been kicked out of schools, their own schools as well as your children's schools, for parents who are totally disengaged with their children's education, we're building a structure to reengage them, to get them back involved, that's the entry point for success and then building the structure, it is done again, communally.  It's not done simply on one parent to one parent basis, even though that's important to have parents talking to other parents, that's critical, but more important than that is the structure and that's what we're building.  We're building, in the black community, a parental involvement structure that is tied into the student achievement structure.  And by the way, these are, there's a natural relationship between parental involvement and student achievement.  It is something that is pretty much unacknowledged in action, in schools.  Schools pretend that they can get student achievement without parental involvement, they can't.  If they were honest, if they were sincere, they would put billions more dollars in parental involvement because what we have found in [The] Black Star [Project, Chicago, Illinois] is that better parents produce better communities, they produce better schools and they produce better students.  Now if you make better students, you don't get better schools, better communities and better parents.  If you make better schools, you don't get better communities and better--parents are the only things that you can make better that will make everything else better.  So that's the strategy for Black Star.
Story_ID: 226248
Speaker 1: It's interesting 'cause you, that's the part of the equation that's left out, isn't it, sort of, I mean, people don't, I mean, there are those that argue that it's hard to even find the parents these days, where are they?  They're not, they don't come to the schools, sometimes they're not even at home, they're somewhere in jail and some are incapacitated in other ways, and grandparents are raising kids or foster people are raising a lot of kids.  Some kids are actually raising other kids themselves, I mean, but that, I mean, how does that impact what you're doing?
Speaker 2: Everything that you said is true and for me, that's just, you know, I've had, I've had some tough jobs, that's just a part of the mix.  Now, while everything that you said is true, that doesn't mean that we shouldn't do the work that needs to be done.  So if they're in jail, then you go to jail.  If they're up at the strip club, then you go to the strip club.  If they're in church, then you go to church.  You know, wherever they are, if they're getting their hair done, then you go, where they're getting their hair done.  It doesn't negate the value or the relationship of a parent to student achievement.  Just because you can't find them, that doesn't mean you stop there.  It doesn't mean that you should try something different.  What it means is, you find 'em, you get 'em engaged, you draw them back in.  So if a guy's in jail, that may mean that you might have to go to jail, engage 'em in jail.  When he comes out of jail, you're going to have to let him know that, yeah, we might have to get you some support to help you get a job, to help you get reconnected, all of it contingent on you getting back involved in the educational lives of your children.  If it's a mama and she's out there and she's doing what, and now, granted, you know that me and, my mother [Norma Marie Freeney] was pretty much mentally incapacitated.  I know that many of these mothers today, they're on that crack.  We know that.  We know that in some of 'em it's worse than that and I understand that.  Still, there has to be this parental structure in place much like my experience when I was immersed in a parental structure in fifth grade [at Charles Kozminski Elementary School; Charles Kozminski Elementary Community Academy, Chicago, Illinois].  It wasn't necessarily the new woman who I knew who was my stepmother [Carolyn Barren (ph.)], I didn't really know her, first time I had ever seen her.  It wasn't my father [Stewart Dine Jackson], simply because I had never really been with him, it was the thing called a structure that gave me the ability to succeed academically, that's simple.  So I'm not saying that the mother has got to be the birth mother or the father's got to be the father, I am saying that there has got to be a structure there for children to grow up in.  Now that structure is not just parental, it's parental, family and community and that's all interwoven, and in fact, if you want to see this thing at work, most successful, look at the Asian culture.  Their children, doing well, or doing the best in school, it is not just incidental to the fact that they have a strongly family structure.  We, we want to think it's incidental.  It's not.  It is directly tied into the family structure.  Here's a very disturbing fact.  In the State of Illinois, 38 percent of black children are reading at grade level, that's this year, 2004, in the fourth grade, 38 percent.  Coincidentally, the U.S. Census for the year 2000 showed that we only have 38 percent of those children coming from a two-parent household.  Now, it's ironic, it's coincidental, but you can see the relationship right there and the solution here is not take the kids and say, we're going to make you learn how to read.  The solution is, correct this deficiency in the parental structure and you will automatically correct the deficiency in the reading, but that's something that this, number one, black people don't see it.  Either they don't see it or they don't care or they want to do something else, either way, it's a part of the destruction process now.  Number two, the government, in my opinion, the government knows what the solution is and they refuse to do it.  I mean, you cannot not know, I mean they look at their families, I mean all they've got to do is go home every night, look at their families and they know what it takes for their families to succeed and then to pretend that it can be otherwise for black children.  In my opinion, the government knows what it takes but they're not doing it.  So, [The] Black Star [Project, Chicago, Illinois] is stepping up at this point saying, no matter what it takes, we are going to fix this problem of this structural deficiency in the black community and that is the beginning to correctly and sufficiently educating black children so that they can compete, succeed and thrive in the new world order.
Story_ID: 226249
Speaker 1: What success have you [The Black Star Project, Chicago, Illinois] had so far?
Speaker 2: Well, we're in a structural building stage and so for the past three years, we've been building structure and that's a good question.  I don't know if it's a fair question because the American education system, as you might know, is a trillion dollar a year business.  So one trillion dollars goes into the American education system and throughout the country, black children are being destroyed and there are not a lot of people asking the U.S. government, what success have you had and I'm not saying--
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm just, I wasn't asking it to be glib--
Speaker 2: Oh, I know.
Speaker 1: --I'm sorry I sounded that way.
Speaker 2: No, it didn't sound that way.
Speaker 1: I was just trying to find out like, what, I mean, since you've, I know you're in a start-up period and all that, but well like what, I'm just asking like, is there any victories you can point to right now or how are you moving towards that?
Speaker 2: Yeah, and it wasn't to be, I want to make my point.  First of all, I didn't think you were being glib, I thought that that was a straightforward, fair question and I'm going to answer it because it is straightforward and fair but what I do get all the time, and I'm not saying you, because of the nature of this interview, you have not been glib and you have been, you have been a fair sounding board, and accurate in your listening and your critiquing, if you will, of everything, but what I am saying is, that's a, that's a question that a lot of people need to have answered.  Where is his success?  Now that question itself, even though I said that what you're asking is fair, that's not fair because to fix this problem, you're not going to begin to see real success until 15, 20, 25 years down the way, if you're really going to fix the problem.  Programmatically, I can give you success.  We've mentored 72,000 children.  We've helped 5,000 young people prepare for college.  We've brought parents, several thousand, two, three, four thousand parents in and we're training them to be better parents.  So those, some people say, oh, well, that's big success.  That's not success, those are programs.  Programmatic success cannot correct a structural deficiency.  And so, I accept your question as being a fair question but you will not be able to measure success on this for twenty-five years from now.  And so in a real sense, I'm just laying the ground work.  You see, what, what our people sometimes fail to realize, we did not get here to where we are in three years, in five years, in fifty years, in 150 years, it's taken close to six hundred years of everything from colonialization [ph.] to slavery to Reconstruction to Jim Crow to continued de jure and de facto segregation for us to get to where we are today and, and, and it is not realistic.  I'm not saying you or your question to think that we're going to start seeing major signs of success in five or ten or twenty-five years.  And so, that was a fair question.  Now, let me tell you where our success is.  Let me answer it this way, and I hope people understand this, our success is in building structure.  Our success is not running out there and claiming victory or claiming, oh, we've made big impact.  Oh, we've found the solution.  We haven't done that and we won't do that.  Our success is that we are laying the groundwork so that somebody is going to come after us, just, much of what Marcus Garvey did, so that somebody can come after him and build on what he did so that we can get to where we are--
Story_ID: 226250
Speaker 1: Where would you assess that you are right now in terms of building the capacity of the organization [The Black Star Project, Chicago, Illinois], I guess, and then, and what's the scope of your activities at this time?
Speaker 2: We're on the verge of going statewide and going national, on the verge, and that's through the wonders of the Internet and the wonders of the World Wide Web.  Today, a gentleman called from Los Angeles [California] and said he's opening up his Los Angeles chapter of Black Star and I said, not so fast.  Let us talk about the standards, let us talk about your programs, let us talk about requirements and then, but I'm getting hits like that from all over the country.  People saying, I've heard about Black Star, we see what you're doing in Chicago [Illinois], and what they see, I mean, they see a lot of movement.  Movement is not progress, and I, and see, I don't want my people to get to smoke and mirrors.  You know, it is so easy for my people to look at Black Star and say, oh, wow, that's the answer, that's the solution.  They're wrong.  The solution is hard work and structure.  There is no magic.  And so now, people all over the country, because we send stuff out to 850 newspapers all over the country, Black Star does through the Internet.  We have members all over the country, through the Internet, so people, black people are connected in a way that they have never been connected ever before and we're trying to use that vehicle to carry our program.  And so, through digital media, we expect Black Star to grow at an exponential ratio.  We've got about five hundred members right now, mostly here in Chicago, but we've got members all over the country, but it's mostly here in Chicago.  We provide services in Chicago to one hundred schools, in Chicago.  With the Internet, we could provide services to thousands of schools all over the country, mentoring services, tutoring services, college preparation services, entrepreneurship services, teaching black kids how to be entrepreneur, we can do that to school systems all over the country.  And so we're using this tool, this electronic tool, to carry our movement to a next level.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, that's the outreach mechanism and so if, if an individual wanted to be a member or to volunteer or, they'd contact you and then there'd be a, you plug them into a component of--
Speaker 2: Absolutely.  Well through e-mail, quite simply, we're connecting people in a way that people, I'm amazed.  I can communicate with five thousand people by pushing three keys on a computer and five thousand people at a time, get the same message.
Speaker 1: And just briefly, what kind of training do you provide for individuals that come, I mean, they, do they get a training or do they, or do you, if they say that they can do something, do you believe them or what?  Rather--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I absolutely don't believe them.  I make it a point not to believe 'em and then even after they get trained, I still don't believe them.  Black Star is not a movement where people tell you what they want to do.  If I can learn anything from Marcus Garvey, it's discipline, it's integrity.  I mean, those were the principles that he was teaching and those are the principles that we try to maintain in Black Star.  So if a, we, so many people tell us what they're going to do.  Black people have been trained to just say things with their mouths and not to back it up with their actions.  I mean, it is a standardized training and so if I talk to 100 black people and 100 black people tell me that they're going to do something, it is not surprising to me that only three of them do it.  It's no longer a surprise but that's the kind of training, and so we're retraining black people.  We're retraining black people so that if one black person tells you that he or she is going to do what he or she says, they do it.  And then we're trying to get to two black people and ten black people to get 'em whereas if they tell you that they're going to do something, if they tell you they're going to make a commitment, you take it to the bank.  Right now, my people are in such a way that they, that it's not important to them, to have integrity, to work on principle and discipline and structure.  Well, that's where our training is coming from and as you said, no, you can't do that all through the Internet but that's why we're starting to travel.  Here in the State of Illinois, we've done a lot, in Evanston [Illinois], Rockford [Illinois], Quincy [Illinois], Markham [Illinois], and so we're traveling with this, Carbondale [Illinois], we're traveling, we're taking this, this concept of serious black people who were serious about educating black children who are serious about reengineering black communities and who are serious about elevating black people all over the world.  In Nigeria, in Ethiopia, in Tanzania and South Africa, in Jamaica, in Haiti, and you know, and Brazil, and Europe, and Germany, there are black people in France and in England, we, The Black Star Project is working to train black people to elevate black people all over the world and we've got a lot of growing to do.  We haven't had any success.  You know a lot of people would say, you've got membership, you're getting some money coming in, you know, you've got a fair size budget, you're working with lots of schools, that's not success.  I mean, right now if anything happens to me, today, Black Star goes away, so there is no success with Black Star.  And so you asked me, what are our successes, none, at this point.  Even with all those things that I've told you, we're not going to have success until black people are able to create and sustain a movement that elevates them, that's what I call success.
Story_ID: 226251
Speaker 1: Now do you have a, I mean, I'm just trying to figure out, now do you, so you're not funded, right?  Or you're--
Speaker 2: No government funding [for The Black Star Project, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: No government funding.
Speaker 2: No government funding.  No foundation funding.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We've been to all the big foundations and they don't think that the work that we do is worth funding.
Speaker 1: Why do they say that?  I mean, what was their, their--
Speaker 2: Well, they don't say that.  They say, oh, well we don't fund that kind of thing or oh, this year we're not going to fund that kind of thing or, oh, you're doing nice work but someone else should fund it, is what foundations tell us, and that's fine, because we're like, I mean, we're like Marcus Garvey, you know, you can't stop us.  You can't stop black people from elevating themselves.  You can't, how long do you think you can hold black people down?  So that's fine that you choose not to fund us, I mean, you know, we're not asking you for permission.  We're, black people, we're not asking you for permission to educate our children.  We're not asking the government for permission to educate our children, we're taking it.  So, so, no, we're not funded but no, there are, we're working with a few benefactors.  There are some corporations, right now.  ComEd [Commonwealth Edison, Illinois], ComEd, which is a big business corporation, you know, they see that we're actually doing the work, that we're actually working with the kids, we're making the kids better, we're making the schools better, we're making the parents better, and they go, wow, they're doing it, they're not talking about it.  Toyota motor sales [Toyota Motor Corporation], and by the way, Toyota is funding the parent university for Black Star.  That went all the way to Tokyo [Japan], and they had to make that decision in Tokyo.  Now you know that before, and if you know anything about Japanese business and Japanese government, they don't just make a decision, willy-nilly, to fund something, Toyota motor sales said, fund it.  That's the kind of program that we want to be associated with.  Black parents working in a positive sense with their schools, with their communities, with their children, the whole community rising up, they said fund that.  They said, we need something like that in Japan, so, so but that, so we're hustling, we're entrepreneurial, we're not, we're not going to wait for somebody to come to us with funding, we're going to ask you and you can fund us, but if you don't fund us, that can't stop us from educating black children.
Speaker 1: Now is there a, do you have a very large staff at this point or--
Speaker 2: No, it's a very small staff.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I've got five part-time people and myself and a corps of volunteers.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Very small.
Speaker 1: Is there, is there an annual meeting for the group, I mean, for the members or something?
Speaker 2: Ah, all the time.  The members meet all the time.  That's the beauty of Black Star, you see, and that's the beauty of technology.  We operate like a multinational corporation on a few people.  So I've got one person who controls, a part-timer controls media.  She gets out information to 805 majority newspapers and to 145 black newspapers.  Any time we want information that goes out, this one person, she fires it all over the country.  We've got another staff member who works on our school programs.  So with a computer, she's managing us getting mentors and motivators and coaches, into a hundred schools, one computer here, one computer there, and so that's the beauty of what we're doing.  Now, it is still not sustainable yet.  We have got to build a sustainable organization that is on autopilot, that if I'm not there, it still goes on.  That if one of the funders pulls out, one of the business funders, it still goes on.  I mean, that's what it's gotta be and it's not that, it is the membership that will do that, and that's why we're working to grow our membership.  Five hundred people, a lot of people, that's pretty good.  That's not nearly where we should be.  And some people say that Marcus Garvey had half a million people, half a million members.
Speaker 1: Some say four million.
Speaker 2: Four million, five million.
Speaker 1: Worldwide.
Speaker 2: Yeah, but, but still, we can, we must do better, but more than the membership, it's that consciousness that we're trying to spread.  It's the idea that black people can and must take control of their own destiny in their own hands and not hating on anybody, not being mad at white people, not being mad at Latinos or Asians, but doing what's right for black people.
