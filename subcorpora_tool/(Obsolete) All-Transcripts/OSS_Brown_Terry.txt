 Nykolaiszyn with the OSU Library. Today is Monday,  December 7, 2015. I am in Marlow, Oklahoma, in Stephens County  interviewing Terry Brown as part of our Cowboys in Every County Oral  History Project. Mr. Brown, thank you for being here today.  Brown Thank you for having me.  Nykolaiszyn Well, I would like to begin by learning a little more about you. Could you  tell me the year you were born and where you were born?  Brown I was born in 1947 in Walters, Oklahoma, in a hospital there. They had one  at that time. Walters, Cotton County.  Nykolaiszyn Tell me a little bit about your parents.  Brown Well, my dad was electrician and worked for REA  Rural Electrification  Administration . Had worked there over twenty years. He had some heart  problems. Tried to move him to a desk job. He didn   t want to do that. He  was out interviewing, actually, went to Lindsay  Oklahoma  for an  interview, and came back through Marlow, and stopped at the City Caf  ,  and found out about this city electrician job was open, and he took it. We  moved here in 1961.  Nykolaiszyn And tell me about your mother?  Brown My mother was, grew up in Ahpeatone, Oklahoma, and I doubt seriously  that anybody knows where that is at. West of Walters, about twenty miles.  It   s close to Grandfield, Oklahoma. Grew up on the farm as one of six  children. She did not work until he passed away in 1964. She started  working and became the school superintendent secretary.  Nykolaiszyn How did your family make their way to Marlow?  5  Brown Well, as soon as my sister graduated in 1961, we got in the car and pulled a  trailer. Drove over here so my dad could go to work for the city. That is how  we got here.  Nykolaiszyn I   ll back up for a second. Growing up in Walters, tell me a little bit about  the schools you attended?  Brown Well, it   s very interesting. I was going to enter the ninth grade. Would not  have been too interested in moving. I was. I had been picked on. I was a  little bitty guy and I got picked on a lot and I was ready to get out of there. I  did like Walters, and of course it   s a homemade memory, so there is some  deal there. Very interesting childhood, but a lot of our family was there. You  didn   t really have to go anywhere. I have never been out of the state of  Oklahoma until I was sixteen years old, other than Texas. I had never left. I  finally got to see the world, but it was later.  Nykolaiszyn Do you have siblings?  Brown I got an older sister that is a retired school teacher. She married a coach and  a teacher here from Marlow, actually. They met at Central State. She went to  Central State, and my brother went to Central State. He became a coach and  coached for forty years. They are all retired now. I   m the only one still  working.  Nykolaiszyn Were you always interesting in playing sports when you were growing up?  Brown Yeah, I loved, I loved, I was doing something with a ball all the time. My  brother was smarter than me. He listened to my dad. He was a good  electrician. He could work on automobiles; he could build things. I couldn   t  do anything unless it had air in it. I couldn   t do it. I loved sports when I was  young. As far as having dreams of playing pro fessional  ball, or going to  college, that wasn   t in my ideals, that wasn   t even a thought of mine because  I didn   t could never dream you could do that. I didn   t know. Then, my dad,  we got here and we weren   t here three years, and my dad passed away  surgery. Kind of left us   I had to work before and after school. Then, I  would go practice football. It was pretty tough, and the scholarship  obviously helped me a lot.  Nykolaiszyn What type of work did you do when you were in high school?  Brown Actually, I worked for the Marlow Review. I was   I poured hot pigs. I don   t  know if you what that is, but that is the old lead that they poured into the     so the linotype machine could operate. You would type out the letters. We  built ads and did a lot of job printing. I was   I really had a skill there if I  wanted to continue. I didn   t.  6  Nykolaiszyn What did, playing ball in Marlow, tell me a little bit about your coach at the  time?  Brown Well, Coach Sevil Pickett was a legend in Oklahoma and he is in the  Oklahoma  Coaches Association  Hall of Fame, and ran the single wing,  which OSU ran back in the    40s. It was an old offense. I played single wing  full back, my senior year, I rushed for over 2,600 yards. That   s a lot. Most  people want to get a 1,000. He was a mastermind at motivation, and my  whole three years in high school, we only lost four games, and they were to  state champions in bigger classes. He was a very successful coach.  Nykolaiszyn You also won a state championship here in    64?  Brown Yes, yes 1964, we beat Bixby for the state championship.  Nykolaiszyn Okay. At that time, were you what were you thinking you wanted to do with  your life?  Brown You know, that is what is so strange about it. Not having a father, with  guidance. I really didn   t know what I was going to do. I was getting  scholarship offers but I didn   t know it. They were coming through the  school, and the coach didn   t give them to me. I think he did that on purpose.  It   s probably a good thing. Until after my senior year, that's when my  recruiting starting. Up until that time, I didn   t even think about. I knew I  wanted to go to college, I just didn   t, I didn   t think I would get to play  college football. I did have some interest in basketball. I was a senior to  watch which is kind of like a blue chip. I had some offers there, but once I  got through my senior year, he gave me all the letters. It   s probably a good  thing that he did it that a way, I concentrated on football. It worked out real  well.  Nykolaiszyn How did you sort through all of your offers?  Brown Well, back then, it was a little different than it is today. The world is shrunk.  I knew I was only going to go one of two places. It was going to be in  Oklahoma. It was going to be OU or OSU. To be honest, in the    50s, I  followed on the radio, we listened to some OU games because of the great  teams that they had back then. I didn   t really know much about OSU. My  mother went there one year and she had to come home. I had, as far as  knowing anything about any of the schools. I didn   t until I started the  recruiting process. I made my decision to go to OSU. I guess you might ask  that question, but I made my decision to go to OSU because of the people,  and I loved the school, I loved the way I was treated. Not that they don   t  treat you that way at the other schools, but they, I just felt comfortable. This  was home and this was where I wanted to go.  7  Nykolaiszyn The recruiting process was happening through your high school years?  Brown Yes, during basketball season, I went on several weekend trips. The one that  sealed it for me, you won   t know this, because you weren   t born probably,  but in 1965, OSU won the Big Eight championship in basketball. I got to see  the Kansas game that OSU beat them in four overtimes. It was a great game.  Exciting, of course, Gallagher Iba  Arena  was blowing through the roof. I  said this is where I want to go, right now. That is probably the major  decision, factor in deciding to go to OSU is being a part of that crowd.  Nykolaiszyn During your visits, did you meet coaches?  Brown Yes, I was recruited by Tommy Ellis. He was a tight end coach or something  like that. Then, I   you met the head coaches, you met all the assistants,  during the recruiting weekends.  Nykolaiszyn What impression did you get of him?  Brown Well, actually, I had a pretty good impression over Gomer Jones at OU. He,  when he came down, the head coach. I picked Phil Cutchin. I knew he had  came from Alabama. I knew that he had a good pedigree, but other than that,  I think the guy, the people that showed me around probably convinced  me   Walt Garrison had a lot to do with it. I will tell you that right now.  Walt was a great guy. Meeting him and we are still friends today.  Nykolaiszyn You finish up your senior year, you graduate from Marlow High, how do  you get from Marlow to Stillwater?  Brown I had to take a ride with a friend. There was a recruit in Duncan  Oklahoma   named Terry Whatley. I didn   t have a car. I didn   t have really no money.  There was nothing in the bank for me. I didn   t have a bank account. I went  up there and road with them. I had one bag, and a couple hanging clothes,  jeans, and shirts, and that was it. It was that way. I didn   t buy a car until my  sophomore year in college. I was able to buy a car because the government  gave me some money because my dad died while I was in college. It wasn   t  very much, sixty dollars a month. No, ninety dollars a month. My payment  on the car was fifty-seven dollars a month. It wasn   t a very fancy car, but it  was about  2,000 back then. I kept that car until I graduated, until I got my  bonus, then I bought another car.  Nykolaiszyn Did you work while you were in Stillwater?  Brown No. On scholarship, that is a job. We figured it up one time. We was making  about thirty-five cents an hour, I think. You couldn   t work. I would, now, I  did go home spring break. I went home Christmas break. I went home  summer. I worked. I worked for Halliburton Oil Company during one  8  summer, and I worked for an oilman the next summer. I had to work to  survive, to be able to go to school. I bought everything I got. Nobody else,  my mother couldn   t help me at all. I knew how bad it was when my sister  came home from college one time. She gave her a ten-dollar bill, and she  hadn   t been home in two months. You know, I knew she wasn   t. She  worked. My brother worked; we had to work. My work was the scholarship.  Thank goodness I got that.  Nykolaiszyn So take me through a typical day at OSU in terms of being a student athlete?  Brown Well, of course we had to get up and go to breakfast. That was one of our  requirements. You couldn   t skip breakfast. You had to sign in every  morning. You had to go to class. Back then, they gave you a deal for the  teacher to sign, that you were in class. I usually took fifteen to sixteen hours  a semester. Just like most average students do. By midafternoon, we were  working out every day, and all year long. Very little time off. You were  doing something all the time. I think they even, they demand more of them  now, I like in the summers and stuff like that, that they didn   t make us do.  Nykolaiszyn Where did you live while you were on campus?  Brown I lived in the athletic dorm. They had athletic dorms back then. I don   t think  they do that now. We lived in West Bennett my freshman year. Then, we  moved to the brand new athletic dorm, which was the Iba Hall. I think it has  changed to a graduate assistant or something, I mean graduate students. I  don   t know what it is now. That was a brand new athletic dorm. Really nice  for us at the time.  Nykolaiszyn Your major was?  Brown I started out in pre-med actually. I realized real quick that I wasn   t   I wasn   t  good enough to do that. I changed to education. I   with an emphasis in  biology. Then, when I came back to finish my degree, I started taking  business courses. I really switched. I really didn   t know what I wanted. I had  no idea. I thought I want to be a football coach. I realized early that that  wasn   t what I wanted. Probably the main factor there was 1959 they fired  the entire staff at Kentucky because they were not very smart. They were not  good coaches. The head coach was Blanton Collier who is an NFL Hall of  Fame coach. His assistants were Ermal Allen, who is one of the geniuses,  offensive geniuses, was the offensive coordinator for the Dallas Cowboys  for twenty years. John North was a head coach. There was a guy from the  Los Angeles Rams, head coach, and three professional scouts. They were  fired because they were incompetent. I said I don   t know that I want this. Of  course, they didn   t get paid like they get paid today. I   m not a coach.  Everybody thinks you are, but I   m not. I can help young people maybe with  9  basics, but as far as being a coach, my brother and brother-in-law are a  1,000 times better than I am.  Nykolaiszyn Well, did you start out playing right away on the varsity squad or did they  have the JV  junior varsity  back then?  Brown Well, we   I don   t know that they called it JV, but the freshman played their  own schedule. We did not play with the varsity. Then, my sophomore year, I  started ever since. I was lucky.  Nykolaiszyn Okay. Your first year on campus, that is the year where we, the big Bedlam  victory.  Brown Yep. That was a big, big win for OSU. I started to realize then the difference  between the schools. I didn   t   I had no idea growing up. Nobody had ever  taken   I didn   t go to a college football game. The first one I went to, I  played in. It was kind of a different, but it was very interesting that freshman  didn   t get to play. We played the University of Arkansas, Cameron Junior  College when they was winning the National Championship, so we played  some pretty good teams.  Nykolaiszyn When you started for OSU, your sophomore year, what was your position?  Brown Well, I played corner. It was funny. I was a big corner, 6    1,    210  pounds .  I was voted one of the top new comers of the year on defense. I thought that  was where my career was headed. I thought that I really had a shot at being  an All-American. Then, my junior year, Coach Cutchin called me in, and  asked, told me, he asked me, I think he was telling me that he was going to  move me to offense to get me the ball. I thought boy that is great. I get to  run the ball. They moved me to blocking back, which I caught a lot of  passes. I set a Big Eight record and OSU record and held up till Hart Lee  Dykes got there. We didn   t throw the ball like they do today. I could have  caught a 1,000 passes if they had thrown it like that. Then, what is funny, at  the end of my career, I got drafted as a defensive back as a safety. I think the  pros knew what position I should have been in.  Nykolaiszyn Any memorable games that stand out for you during your time?  Brown Well, I think, probably the Colorado game my junior year. They were  number three in nation. We upset them ten to seven. I think that was one of  the biggest games. We played so well that day. We had some very good  talent on this team. We should have won a lot more games than we did. I  don   t have the answer except chemistry. That one, then my senior year, I  had two games where I caught ten passes. That was a lot back then. That  was really, that was a big deal for me. Against Kansas and Missouri, and I  became friends with Roger Wehrli later, and he was a defensive back  at  10  Missouri . He got the game ball our senior year. I caught ten passes. If he  hadn   t intercepted three, then I would have had three touch downs. It was  interesting. Those were probably the biggest games.  Nykolaiszyn You mentioned Walt Garrison a little while ago. Any teammates that really  stand out in your mind?  Brown My teammates?  Nykolaiszyn Oh yeah.  Brown Jon Kolb played for the Steelers fifteen years, four Super Bowls. We make  fun of him of him when he got drafted. He got drafted by Pittsburg and they  was one in fifteen. He got the last laugh because he got four Super Bowl  rings. I got to play in two, but I didn   t win any. John was there, Jerry Sherk,  John Ward, John Little. We had some guys that played pro ball for a long  time that were really good. Bob Cutberth. There was Larry Gosney played  on that team. He made the final, got to the final cut for Green Bay. Lot of  talent,  but needed to be at the right place at the right time .  Nykolaiszyn As you   re progressing through college, did you have any idea of what you  wanted to do or did you know that you had a good chance of being drafted?  Brown Well, I didn   t   it was funny I started getting letters from pro fessional   teams my sophomore year. You can   t play until you are a senior. I started  realizing that I might have a chance to go to pro ball. Of course, it got bigger  and bigger my senior year. We got, I got to play in a couple of all-star games  that really helped me. I knew that I was going to get, I was going to get a  shot. Whether I made it or not, I was going to get a  chance . A lot of teams  like the Dallas Cowboys make you think you are going to be their number  one draft choice. Everyone I talked to, thought the same thing. I didn   t  realize, I would be drafted by Saint Louis. I had no clue. You never know.  Nykolaiszyn Did you graduate right on time?  Brown No, at the end of four years, believe it or not, I lacked three hours. Here   s  how I got to finish line. That off season, I had to join the Army Reserves so  I could play pro fessional  football. Otherwise, I was going to the Army and  going to Vietnam. I got in in the unit. That off season, I had to go to active  duty, which I did. I came back the next fall  and there was  football. The  next spring,    71, I got to graduate, I got to finish and graduated. I stayed  with it. That   s when I started taking business courses.  Nykolaiszyn Okay.  11  Brown That last, instead of taking three hours, I took a bunch of business courses,  and that has helped me.  Nykolaiszyn You were drafted in the third round by Saint Louis in 1969. What was going  through your mind when you learned you were drafted?  Brown I couldn   t believe it. Number one, that it was really going to happen. I flew  to Saint Louis that weekend. I   they gave me a  100 bill. I thought, my  goodness, this is going to be a good deal. I had never seen a  100 bill. My  first salary was  16,000. Not like today   s  salaries . The number one draft  choice got  18,000. It was not like a big difference. The biggest difference  was the bonus. I got a  25,0000 bonus. Immediately, went and a bought a  car. It wasn   t fancy. It was just a good car. That was the first thing I did. It  cost me  3,200, 1969.  Nykolaiszyn What did you buy?  Brown It was a Pontiac LeMans. I doubt if you   ve even heard of it. They don   t even  make them anymore. It was like, they had a Pontiac GTO which was the  high dollar deal. Then, the LeMans was right below it. Not quite as fancy. I  didn   t want fancy. I just wanted a car that could go. I had had one that was  about come to the end.  Nykolaiszyn Did you enjoy your time in Saint Louis?  Brown Yeah, I really did. Roger Wehrli and I became very good friends and still are  today. I like Saint Louis. I like Minnesota better though. I didn   t stay up  there in the off season. I bought a house in Saint Louis, but I didn   t stay in  Minnesota, that thirty below and forty below in the winter didn   t feel very  good to me.  Nykolaiszyn Were you traded to Minnesota?  Brown Not really. It   s a long story. Back then, I had in 1971, I had beat out the  safety and I was starting and he was all pro. I dislocated my hip. I had to sit  out the whole year. I came back in    72, and I beat him out again. Broke my  jaw in two places in a pre-season game. Well, they put me on what they  called injury reserve. There   s only one way to get off injured reserve. That is  to go through waivers. They told me they wouldn   t take that change. All of a  sudden, they did. Minnesota picked me up like that. They had just had a  safety that was involved in a bad motorcycle accident. I went to Minnesota  on that deal. I was told I would not be put on waivers, but they did. I went to  Minnesota, it was the best break, literally, that I ever had. I loved the  teammates that they had. We went to the Super Bowl. I got to experience  that.  12  Nykolaiszyn You have the distinction of being the only native Oklahoma     Brown Actually that changed.  Nykolaiszyn It did. Did it change recently?  Brown I was the first native. I used to say I was the only native Oklahoma n  to  score a touchdown in the Super Bowl, but when  Jeremy  Shockey from  Ada did it, I became the first, but they can   t take that away from me. They  can take the other part, but     Nykolaiszyn Well, tell me about that.  Brown It was being in the right place at the right time. We played, I mean, all of us  in Minnesota, we played on all the special teams and everything. I was on  the punt team, punt block team. We went in and Mack Blair blocked the  punt down deep on the field. The ball took a bounce and bounced right in  my hand as I stepped across the goal line. It wasn   t a seventy-yard  interception. I told everybody in Marlow that. That   s not true. It was a one  yard ball, and it just fell right into my arms. It was just the luck of the draw.  Nykolaiszyn You had one more stop after Minnesota.  Brown I got traded to Cleveland in 1976. Part of that was my problem because I had  made some requests to the head coach. Biggest mistake I have ever made. I  wish I could have it over, but I can   t. I don   t like Cleveland very much.  After that year, I said I   m through. This is it. We had kids in school. It was  time that we moved back to Stillwater at that time.  Nykolaiszyn So, I am going to back up a second and ask you how you met your wife?  Brown Okay, well actually, I met her at the swimming pool in Marlow, Oklahoma.  We were childhood, high school sweethearts. We dated five or six years  before we got married. I met her right here in Marlow, and married her and  we been married forty- eight  years.  We both believed in a lifetime  commitment, and we loved each other very much.   Nykolaiszyn After your time in Cleveland, you retired? You moved back to Oklahoma, so  why, you can move anywhere, you can go anywhere, and you returned to  Oklahoma.  Brown Okay, you are in Marlow, Oklahoma right now. It   s 5,000 people. On a  really bad day, I mean really bad day, I mean when the traffic is at its  highest, it takes me two minutes to get home. I make a good salary, but  money is not the reason I live here. I could have stayed in the cities and  done really well. I had almost anything. I had a lot of opportunities. I like  13  small towns. I like the people. I   m two hours from Stillwater. I   m two-and-a-  half, three hours from Dallas. I   m an hour from Oklahoma City. I don   t  know why you would want to live in that mess. I can go do anything they do  anytime. I do not like traffic. I still don   t like traffic. I really was intending  to come to Stillwater. I don   t know if you remember Dupree Sports, but I  was, Gordon was going to sell me the sporting goods store. I really wanted  to buy it, and something happened, and he decided not to sell it. That is  when I moved to Marlow. I had a chance to buy the Marlow Review that I  worked for, and that fell through. Then, this opportunity what I have been  doing for the last thirty-seven years fell into my lap. Been the best thing that  has ever happened to me. I went to work for State Farm insurance as an  agent. I   ve been here ever since.  Nykolaiszyn Did you know much about the insurance business?  Brown Nothing. In fact, I was one of those guys in college that said I will never sell  insurance. Those guys would come in your dorm and try and sell you stuff. I  said, I will never do that. It   s a lot different than that. It   s   I sell all lines, so  it   s not quite, just, I got to sell that life policy, I got to sell that life policy,  but all you do is show people your needs. They buy them or don   t buy them,  it   s up to them. If they got a need, they know they got to buy something.  I   ve enjoyed the insurance industry. It   s given me an opportunity to be able  to watch my kids play sports and do things, and musicals, and speech  departments, whatever it is. I got to do all that without really ever having  any trouble. I enjoyed every bit of it.  Nykolaiszyn I   m guessing a lot of the insurance business is about building relationships  within communities.  Brown Yep.  Nykolaiszyn You moved home. I can   t think of a better way to     Brown Well, when I got here, to be honest, there was some of them that wanted to  be sure that I stayed before they changed. They finally did. I have had some  great customers over the years. I have customers all over the state. If you  know the right people, and they are willing to do business with you. It will  work. I am at the end of my career. I   m not going to keep doing this. I   m  just, I don   t know why I haven   t retired. It   s fun and I still enjoy it. I still do  coffee shop two or three times a day. I   m not working that hard any more. A  lot of people say I don   t do anything, but that   s all right.  Nykolaiszyn Tell me a little bit about your kids.  Brown Well, my oldest daughter Kristen  graduated with a business degree from  OSU and now lives in Marlow, Oklahoma. Her husband, Steve Terrell, is an  14  OSU graduate and is a pilot for American Airlines. He was a Flying Aggie  (aviation club member) an, and he actually flew the basketball coaches and  the team on several occasions. They have three children, twins Makenzie  and Sydney and a son, Karsten.  Suzanne is the middle child and went a different direction. She graduated  from Baylor with a business administration degree. She ended up working  for the OSU Alumni office for Jerry Gill. She found her husband in  Stillwater. She married Steve Bomhoff who is also an OSU graduate with a  degree in engineering. They live in Okarche, Oklahoma, where he is a fourth  generation farmer/rancher. Steve also spots for Larry Reece at the football  games. They have three children, Taylor and twins Katie and Rob. Both  Steves were members of the AGR fraternity at OSU.  Our son Greg lives in Edmond, Oklahoma, where he is a salesman for  Mimedix. He also played football at OSU and is a business graduate. He and  I are one of two father/son duos who both beat OU twice during our playing  time. He and his wife Julie have four boys, Ace, Brex, Crew, and Dax. Our  hope is that one of them will carry on the tradition of playing football at  OSU.   Nykolaiszyn You are still very involved in the Marlow community. You   ve called football  for years.  Brown I retired that. I called games for thirty-five years. Play by play, and I been  president, chamber of the lions club, president of the foundation. I   ve done it  all here. I been doing the parades here. I set up the parades. Been doing that  over forty years. They are about to get rid of me. If they could find an  excuse they would.  Nykolaiszyn I guess a little over a year ago, you have a little stretch of street here in  Marlow?  Brown It took them fifty years, but they named a street after me. It   s only two  blocks. It   s right by the football field. Nobody had to change their address. I  already had complaints. They want me to fill the chug holes. I said, if you  will let me charge a toll, I will start doing that.  Nykolaiszyn Well, looking back on your career at OSU, how did attending the university  impact your life?  Brown I think most people would say the same thing. The people that I met, and the  people that I have come across, some of the greatest people in the world.  Not just while I was there. People prior to me, and people after me. I have  gotten to know some of the people that set the stage for the rest of us. The  Bob Fenimores, the Neill Armstrongs, the Yojiro Uetakes and those guys,  15  those types of guys that became friends of mine. I think that is what   s you  are talking about relationships that last forever. That is the key. That is  reason that I picked OSU. No offense to OU, but when I went to OU, I  didn   t fit. I didn   t feel like   they asked me what my dad did and what  fraternity I was going to join. I didn   t, my dad wasn   t alive and I didn   t even  know what a fraternity was at the time. It just didn   t fit me. The people of  OSU, even today, are still the greatest people I have ever been around. They  really seem to care that you are still alive.  Nykolaiszyn In this neck of the woods here in Oklahoma where we are here in Stephens  County. Is it more, I only ask, I noticed driving into town, I noticed home of  the Outlaws, Welcome to Marlow. On the back side of that sign, I want to  say it had some OU reference.  Brown That was the big OU alumni that tried to get me to go to OU. He owns that  property. He is not alive anymore. That   s why that sign is there. If, I think  there is a lot of OSU people in Stephens County. I really do. Now, OU still  probably got the most. There   s a lot of OSU people here. I don   t worry  about that and don   t think about it. There is a lot more OSU people here than  a lot of places. I will tell you the story of when we moved here. My daughter  was in second grade. Her first question for me when she came home from  school that day was,    Dad why does everybody hate OSU?    You know, it   s  just kids. I tried to explain it to her. Now, she bleeds orange more than I do.  She can   t stand it. She don   t like to lose to anybody     Nykolaiszyn These days, how do you show your loyalty?  Brown Well, of course we were season ticket holders for forever, thirty-something  years. I, to be honest, I have given that up. That is because I can   t stay  awake. I don   t want to drive. I give you a story. (Laughter) One time, we  was driving home and I got to Chickasaw  Oklahoma  and I told my wife, I  said,    I can   t go any further. You are going to have to drive.    She drove and  I woke up at two o   clock in the morning in the parking lot in Walmart in  Duncan. She went shopping. I didn   t even know it. When you are that tired  and sleepy, it   s kind of weak. We still support OSU in a lot of ways.  Stephens County and through the whole thing. We are lifetime members of  the alumni association. We still pull for every one of them everything they  do.  Nykolaiszyn Well, you have been here in Marlow a long time, can you just talk a little bit  about the community and how it has changed through the years?  Brown When I moved here, there was five thousand people. There is still five  thousand people. It hasn   t grown. We are kind of landlocked. Within eight  miles every direction, there is a school. The little Bray-Doyle community,  Central High community, Rush Springs, and Duncan. You are not going to  16  grow as the school. The school is   we are 3A. It   s a good school system. I  think a lot of people come here for that reason. As far as   it   s a, it   s a rural  community. There   s farmers. A lot of oil field people or people in that  industry. So, that is kind of, a lot of people drive to Fort Sill  Oklahoma  to  work, government workers. My mother drove over there for a little while  until she got the Marlow job. It   s a bedroom community. It   s funny how it  really hasn   t grown. People die and new people come in.  Nykolaiszyn How has downtown changed through the years?  Brown Well, we don   t have   we have two drug stores downtown when I was a kid.  We had a skating rink. We had a movie theatre which we don   t have  anymore. We have a lot of, I call them mercantile shops, antiques and stuff  like that. We actually got two restaurants that are as good as any place in the  state of Oklahoma. I promise you good, Giuseppe   s, unbelievable. It was  Giuseppe   s before Stillwater got theirs. Then, they got a new 213 Barbecue  that is really good. We got three banks which is unusual for this small of a  town. We are only ten miles from Duncan. Our biggest industry is Wilco  Manufacturing. They   ve gone from because of the economy right now,  because the oil played out, they have gone from almost 500 employees  down to maybe 200. That scares me a little bit. We have been there before.  When you live in an oil community, you are going to see it.  Nykolaiszyn Absolutely. We have noticed, we have talked to a lot of alumni that most  have this strong connection to OSU   s loyalty. Why do you think that is?  Brown Well, that is a good question. I just, maybe it   s a warm fuzzy feeling that I  have about OSU and the way that people treat you. I think that is the biggest  thing. I think most of the people that come out of there want to give back. I  think, even when you talk fans and football, I guarantee our loyal fans are  always going to be there. No matter what happens. We can go 0-10 and they  are still going to be there. You don   t see that at other schools. They are  either on the bandwagon or they are off the bandwagon. I think that moves  on into the next phase of your life when you are able to make some money  or do something and you are able to give back to the community or back to  the university you went to. I think that is probably the reason.  Nykolaiszyn What   s up next for you? Are you looking to retire?  Brown I probably am going to retire in the next year, year-and-a-half. Then, I can  go and travel and do what I want to for a little bit. We have ten  grandchildren so we stay pretty busy watching basketball, soccer, all the  baseball, and all the stuff that goes on. They keep us pretty busy.  Nykolaiszyn When people look back on Terry Brown, what would you like people to  remember about you?  17  Brown I think I would want them to, this is true anywhere, anytime, Marlow,  Stillwater, I don   t care where it is, to say that he is a man of integrity, that  you can believe what he says, he   s always there to help if you need him  and  that God had directed my life .  Nykolaiszyn Anything else you would like to add before we close on out?  Brown Go Pokes   Nykolaiszyn I think that works. Thank you so much for joining us today.  -------  -------
