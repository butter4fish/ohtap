  Finchum  Floyd  Finchum  Floyd  Finchum  Floyd  This is October 3, 2007, and I   m here in Ada, Oklahoma. My name is  Tanya Finchum. I   m with the Oklahoma State University Library, and  we   re doing an oral history project entitled, Women of the Oklahoma  Legislature. And I   m here with Billie Jean Floyd who was in the Senate  from    84 to    88. Right?  That   s right.  Thank you for having me.  Oh, well it   s my pleasure for you to come, and I was flattered that you  all chose me.  Well, thank you. Our first topic of the day is to tell us a little bit about  your childhood, where you were born and then we   ll work forward.  Okay. Well, my mother and dad came to Ada, Oklahoma in 1918, and  my older sister was a baby then, and they came from Coal County. My  mother   s from Mississippi and my dad was from Texas. They met in  Coal County, married and came up here, and my brother and me   we  were all born in Ada. I was raised and it was a wonderful time. I was  born Christmas Eve, 1929, and of course that was the beginning of the  Depression. The next winter, I understand, was a terribly cold winter,  but I ruined Christmas for everybody that year. That was when you  didn   t discuss whether there was a baby coming or not, it just sort of  happened. My brother and sister were most upset when I arrived and  spoiled Christmas, but they got over it and my childhood was wonderful.  I didn   t have to worry about the environment. I didn   t have to worry  about anything.  We apparently were pretty well insulated from the Depression in that my  dad did have a job with Railway Express. My mother was a  5  Finchum  Floyd  homemaker   always there when we came home from school. She was  always there   three meals and clean clothes and just a typical stay-at-home  mom of that time period. I had no cares in the world, it was just  wonderful. I can look back now and it was just a delight. I had wished  many times that my daughters had had such a carefree time or people  today had such a carefree time as we did.  I went to the Ada schools. I went to Horace Mann, Willard, Ada Junior  High, Ada High School   graduated high school in 1947. And one of the  reasons that my parents moved to Ada was that there was a college, or a  normal school here, and my mother was very, very interested and very  concerned that we have an education. So there was never any question  when I graduated high school, no doubt you went to college. So I went  to college   again, college was wonderful. I didn   t have any worries  there   bridge and pinochle, sorority   not a care in the world. The only  thing that was different with my college years was that the veterans of  World War II were coming back on the GI Bill, and we certainly had a  different group of students. The college life was changing a little bit then  from the rah-rah   that sort of thing that was probably right before us,  and we were going into married students, men coming back, and it was  different.  We got a little bit of that in high school because my high school years  were World War II years and junior high we bought savings bonds and  stamps. Every Monday morning, everybody brought a quarter and  bought a defense stamp   that was junior high, high school. There were a  few of the boys in my high school classes that went into the service and  didn   t come back, many of them. And, of course, watching Ken Burns  now, his movie on the war, it brings back many fond memories of my  high school and college that I really wasn   t aware of then, but I can look  back now and see what was going on. Then after college   do you want  me to go on then?  Sure.  After college, again graduate work. I mean, I graduated and it was  graduate school   I was very fortunate. I had some wonderful mentors in  college. I have always been an outdoor person. I love people. I was  always bringing the whole neighborhood home when I was growing  up   the tomboy in the neighborhood   always been a tomboy   and that  is something else I think that has affected my going into politics like I  did. When I was raised, we were not raised as a girl or a boy. We were  raised as whatever needed to be done, you did. If it was iron, you ironed.  If it was go out and help your dad dig a ditch, you did that. Wherever  you were needed   paint the house, you helped paint   shingle the  house   whatever it was. There was never any difference when I was  6  Finchum  Floyd  Finchum  Floyd  growing up made between a woman   s work or a man   s work. We did  whatever we needed to move the unit forward and to do our share, you  know. So I think that has had a big influence on some of the things I   ve  done in later life   the way I was raised.  And so anyway, went on to graduate school, went to Texas Women  University. Came back then and taught. My first teaching year was in  Duncan, and I taught third grade in Duncan. But back to my college  years, I started doing my student teaching when I was a sophomore in  college, and this was before teaching and that sort of thing was   we had  the lab schools then. I was doing all of the physical education,  swimming activities for Horace Mann Lab School from the time I was a  sophomore until I graduated college, and so as a result then, after my  one year of teaching third grade in Duncan, they invited me to come  back. I signed a contract at East Central University so I came right into  the university then teaching, and my first year of teaching my check was   2,500.  For the whole year?  Oh, for the whole year. Yes, for the whole year  (Laughs) Oh, you bet,  for the whole year  And I thought we   d never   I mean, when we  reached  3,000, oh, golly   I mean we were just ecstatic. I got married in  1952 or 3   I either got married on May 2, 1953 or May 3, 1952, and I  have to always check and see which it was   but I got married during  that time, and my husband, Ben, was a Korean veteran, and we had gone  together in high school. We grew up together, and we   d known each  other. So I got married, and he finished his degree and he was lucky  enough that he started teaching also in the Ada school system and so we  were married and then taught. Our first child, Carey Floyd, was born in  1958 and then in 1961 our second daughter was born, Amy B. And so  we have lived here all of our lives. Mother and Dad, brother and sister     my brother and sister did a little bit of time away from here, but Ben and  I always stayed in Ada. This has just been   roots I guess you   d say     and so I taught and then in 1984 it hit, and I said,    I can do a better job  than anybody up there,    and so I decided to run for the State Senate seat,  District 13.  Just like that?  Just like   well, not just like that. I had talked to some friends and we  talked about it   when I was   the other thing, when I was growing up  politics and religion were always discussed at meals in our family. And  this was back in the day when I was growing up when you sat around  and you listened to the adults talk. There was no television, very little  radio, and you made up your own games and that sort of thing and  7  played paper dolls and playhouses. There were no commercial activities  for children. So listening to adults was a real big part of growing up.  And I had a grandfather, my dad   s father, Wade Holland Fathree, was a  big red-faced Irishman   and this was before DHS  Department of  Human Services  and that sort of thing   so he would come and spend  three months with this child and three months with the next child. He  was by himself then and I can remember him telling me the stories about  the    R-o-o-sians      they were not Russians, they were    R-o-o-sians        and he had some problems with the Pope. He had homesteaded in New  Mexico, and he and my grandmother left Coal County also and went to  western New Mexico, Quemado. They homesteaded there and nearly  starved to death, I might add, because they were there parts of the Dust  Bowl and that sort of thing. So anyway, it was not a good time to be  going out there homesteading, but he loved politics and loved to read,  and I remember him telling me stories   political stories, I wish I could  remember more.  And then I had an aunt, Aunt Mae Azlin. Aunt Mae was my mother   s  older sister. Aunt Mae, when I was just a little bitty kid, I can remember  she would have her apron on and she would gather me up and those little  cards that were about this long that were printed in black, and it was     Vote for Coppert Doo      city treasurer or county treasurer or whatever  it was   and it had to have that little union thing on it, you know. It was  a little black and white card, and she would have probably a hundred or  fifty of those and she would probably get  5.00 for doing the  neighborhood, handing those out. She   d have those in her apron pocket,  and I   d do one side of the street and she   d do the other side of the street.  I can remember doing that and being fascinated by politics   but then  again, politics were always discussed. It was always a lively discussion  and, of course, my folks thought, and my aunt thought, Franklin Delano  Roosevelt hung the moon. I mean, that was the time that they needed,  and when he did his New Deal and when he saved people. I can  remember hearing my dad say,    Well, you know, if it hadn   t been for  him doing time payment, the poor working man would never have had  refrigerators, cars, any of those things because the working man had to  have a way to buy those things.    So it was always a lively discussion.  Herbert Hoover   oh, my goodness gracious   bad scene   bad scene,  and then from then on   I can even remember when John F. Kennedy  was running and, of course, Aunt Mae thought John F. Kennedy was  wonderful. But I can remember hearing the discussion about a Catholic  president   it was just too, they just didn   t know about that. So those  were some of the things but that   s kind of my early childhood, and some  of the things that have happened along the way. I   ll probably think of  others as we talk, if you want me to mention about those, but   then  when I ran for the Senate, I was elected and     8  Finchum  Floyd  Finchum  Floyd  Finchum  Floyd  Finchum  Floyd  Tell me a little bit about your campaign.  Oh, okay   my campaign   well     Campaign manager was     Oh     Yourself?  Well, of course. (Laughs) Who else? Money   I ran the   there were four  people, the incumbent, two other men, and myself in the primary, and I  think the fact that my name was Billie may have had some influence on  the vote because they didn   t know whether I was a man or a woman. But  before   I guess I   ve gotten the cart before the horse on that, too, a little  bit there. Before I tell you about my campaign, do you want me to tell  you why   one of the reasons why I did what I did?  Yes.  I told you that our oldest daughter was a veterinarian. Well, I really got  involved big-time with the Equal Rights Amendment, and I was very,  very concerned that   equal pay for equal work. And of course I guess I  have always been a flaming liberal. You just have to say that. I have  always felt you could do anything you were big enough to do, but I  never knew that there were any limitations. It was just never an issue. If  you want to do it, set your sights and do it. Now if you can   t do it, well  then maybe you made a bad mistake and you need to do something else.  You   re not entitled to it just because you want to do it, but if you decide  that you   re going to be the senator from this district, well power to you,  that   s it.  And of course we live in a very redneck district   I mean, women are  supposed to stay pregnant and barefooted. I mean, it   s just one of those  things in this part of the country. That was the philosophy back so many  years ago. And so anyway, the Equal Rights Amendment came up, and I  went door to door. I went   Atoka and Coal County   and froze myself  to death with other women going door to door saying,    Sign this  petition,    and we all gathered all of these names on this petition to send  to the Oklahoma State Senate and House. If Oklahoma had ratified the  Equal Rights Amendment, it would have been the state that we needed  to make it then a part of the Constitution, see. So, okay, I was there. Lou  Watkins   Wes and Lou were living here at the time, and Lou taught at  East Central, taught political science and of course, Lou and Wes were  very active in politics. They were democrats at that time, I might add,  and so they were very active and they helped us, she did especially.  9  Finchum  Floyd  And you would go to the door of those people in Atoka and Coal  County   and those are two of the poorest counties in Oklahoma   and  you   d knock on that door and that lady understood what you were saying  when you said,    Would you sign this because we feel that equal work  and equal pay should be   you shouldn   t get paid less just because  you   re a woman, and you should be treated equally on the job market,  you should be considered for the job if you can do it, not because you   re  black, not because you   re white, but you just should be given equal  treatment, or because you   re a woman      and then it didn   t happen. It  didn   t get any place. I was very frustrated, and Senator Roy Boatner  from Durant   Calera, down in that part of the country, was supposed to  be the vote we were supposed to push over   that was it. If we could get  him, and this was where all of these petitions were going to was to him,  and if he would change his vote from a    no    to a    yes,    we   d have it.  Well, it didn   t happen.  Then I ran for the Senate and I got elected   stars in my eyes. Got up  there and then I heard   you   re gonna hear   then I heard the  discussion   Roy didn   t have an opponent. He was not running. You  know, you run every four years in the state senate, he didn   t have an  opponent. He could take the heat. He didn   t intend to change his vote.  He had already committed that he would be a    no      a firm    no      there  would be nothing to it. We could have delivered a ton of paper up there.  I was never so (Laughs)   oh, I tell you, my eyes went open. So that was  one of my experiences that caused me maybe to do some other things a  little bit later and has effected what I   ve done since then, but that was  one of the things that caused me to really get in politics. But when I ran  my campaign, I think my primary, I spent maybe  5,000, maybe     homemade signs, hand to hand   you   ll see a little bucket around here,  and I should get one for you and show you. It was my trademark   I had  these little buckets   don   t go away, I   ll show you.  Okay.  There may be one right here. But it doesn   t have it on it. Anyway, I   ll  show you. Carried these little buckets   this one doesn   t have it on it, but  there   s one   there   s some in the house that still do, and it had    Billie  Floyd    on it,    Elect Billie Floyd, State Senate District 13    and we   d  written it in ink and in magic marker and everything else on there. I  carried it full of peppermints, and this was one of my   I mean, this is  what I spent some of my money for were the peppermints, and we  ditto   ed off,    Your vote means a mint to me   vote Billie Floyd.    And  that slogan came from one of my students, a young man here in Ada,  Harold Harbin. He came up to me and he said,    Ms. Floyd, this would  just be great      he said,    Give them a peppermint.    So I used that, and  I   d come up and I   d shake your hand and I   d say,    Hello, my name is  10  Finchum  Floyd  Finchum  Floyd  Finchum  Floyd  Finchum  Floyd  Billie Floyd and I   m running for the State Senate, and I just want to tell  you that your vote would mean a mint to me, and here it is to show you.     And if I ran into somebody that was kind of crusty and didn   t want to  take it, I   d say,    Hey, go on. You can at least eat my campaign material,  and you sure can   t eat those cards those other people are handing out,     And they would remember me from that, but I loved to campaign.  I love people and, I mean, it was not work, it was fun. It was really a fun  thing, and I wouldn   t take anything for it but that was one of the   okay  about  5,000 and then sure enough (Laughs) I got there. Then, of course,  there was a run-off between the incumbent and myself. I carried every  box but one in the general election, every one but one. Joy, Oklahoma  was the only box I didn   t carry. When we had my swearing-in, the whole  gallery at the State Senate was full of people from Ada, Oklahoma.  There has never been one like it since   and I   m not bragging, I   m just  saying. And then we all went out to someplace out on North Kelly,  someplace out there where there was a Chinese student that had been a  student at East Central, George Ing, and he was the ma  tre-d there at one  of the restaurants. We filled it up. We ate after that, and it was a fun  time, and we really had a lot of neat people in on it. So it was just   that  part of it, I think I finally spent about   I think maybe  20,000 maybe for  the whole thing.  That won   t touch it these days.  Oh, you couldn   t even begin   you couldn   t even begin.  Well, did you live there or did you commute from here?  No, I rented an apartment and I lived there. I went up every Sunday  evening because I felt like being a teacher, I had to get up there and get  ready for the Monday morning class. I went up every Sunday evening  and I lived in an apartment, and then I would come home on Thursdays  and, do the things in the district like you   re supposed to do   but I lived  there.  Describe a typical day while you were there.  Well, okay.  How early and how late?  Well, you hit the road early, early, early. I   d hop out of bed and get  ready to go, and get to the Capitol by   shortly after   around 8:00, 8:30  at the latest because you needed to get there. The first year, I brought a  secretary from home, and that was something else that I found out later  11  Finchum  Floyd  Finchum  Floyd  that probably you shouldn   t do because those ladies that are the  secretaries in the House and the Senate, most of them do it because they  want to and they know the politics. It made it difficult because we were  both new, and my best friend, who was also a secretary, came up and  was my secretary so that made it kind of tough. There were four of us  that were freshmen that year. They were Roy Sadler and Ben Brown,  Helen Cole, and myself. Helen was the republican and Ben and Roy  Sadler were the other two democratic senators that were elected when  we were elected, so there were only four of us elected new in the Senate  that year.  Two women and two men.  I would get there and get my bills, read my bills   try to get my bills  read. Then after I got my bills read, why usually in the morning you had  constituents coming in and you had committee meetings. You would go  to your committee meetings. Agriculture, Tourism, and Education were,  I think, the three committees that I was appointed to. And then those  would meet and you   d take up the bills and, of course, you know first  reading by leadership, second reading is in committee, third reading is  by the full Senate.  You   d go to your committee meetings and you   d hear your bills and  that   s where they were sometimes amended. I learned a great deal  because I was not a government major or a pre-law major or anything  like that. I was a physical education major and so this was kind of, it was  really a learning experience for me. Ben Brown was really great. He sat  right in front of me, and he helped me a lot. He had been in the House.  Helen Cole was wonderful. Helen was really a neat person. I wish she  were still living today so you could interview her. In fact, Helen   s  almost a relative   I mean there was that relative thing there even though  she was a republican and I was a democrat   Helen was really nice.   Bernice  Shedrick was nice, but Shedrick commuted so she wasn   t there  all the time     Okay.  So she didn   t have a lot of time to fool with the rest of us. Plus, she   s a  lawyer so she had a law practice she was doing, so that was another  thing that kind of kept her from   but I think back of Shedrick. She was  the only woman for so long and they ridiculed her because she wanted a  restroom for the women in the lounge, the Senate lounge. And  everybody hee-hawed and gaffed about how that was a waste of  money   promise you, it wasn   t, because when you   re up there working  and you   re trying to hear bills, you   re trying to get to committee  meetings, and every school in the countryside is up there with all of their  12  Finchum  Floyd  Finchum  Floyd  Finchum  Floyd  two or three hundred kids and you   re trying to get things done, you  cannot get in any of the bathrooms. So, I mean, it really was a good  thing they did that. I thank Bernice for that. She took the heat on it, but it  was good.  And then in the afternoon you went in to session about 1:00   1:00, 1:30  according to when the Speaker wanted you   or President Pro Tempore  wanted you to go in   and you went in and then you started hearing your  bills. Of course there was always the agenda and it was always sobering  to find out that bills might get out of committee but that didn   t mean that  they were going to get heard on the floor.  And how was that decision made?  The President Pro Tempore     Decides?     and the leadership decide. The floor leader decides what bills will be  heard. And you don   t just jump up and say,    I want my bill heard.    You  have to wait until it   s on the agenda and it   s called for on the floor and  then you can. That   s why this knowing how to attach yourself to  somebody else   s bill, to move, to reconsider the vote by which your bill  passed and then to get control of somebody else   s bill   there   s all kinds  of things that you learn to do. There   s more than just saying,    I   ve got a  good bill and it needs to be heard.    And at the local level   I   m sorry  you   ve got sound effects in the background. (Laughs     guinea hens are  clucking)  I think it   s perfect.  That may be Sonovia   no, that   s not Sonovia   that   s one of the others.  Sonovia Petit is the one that usually comes up and tells us what   s going  on  referring to a guinea . Well anyway, I was going to say the  maneuvering to see whether your bill was going to be heard or not and  the leadership   oh, at the local level, whether you   re a democrat or a  republican doesn   t matter. I mean, in most rural communities a great  deal and you don   t have party differences so much   at least you used to  didn   t   it   s gotten greater now. It   s gotten uglier now. I mean it   s much  uglier than it used to be.  At the county level, there   s a little bit of difference whether you   re a  republican or democrat, but you   re still basically working for the good  of the county or of the clan. When you get to the state level, you start  seeing there is a difference and you start understanding that those points  that those different parties have embraced at the federal level come  13  Finchum  Floyd  Finchum  Floyd  Finchum  Floyd  Finchum  Floyd  Finchum  Floyd  down and you   re expected to adhere to the planks of the party if you  want to move things along. Now then, it   s changed now and we have  lots of people that party doesn   t matter, or at least they say party doesn   t  matter. At the federal level, it gets worse. It does. I mean, you have party  politics then   it really gets to be party then and you   re expected to  definitely embrace what the planks are of your party   s platform.   More guinea hens clucking  Well, the sound effects at Homer,  Oklahoma out in the country on a wonderful Wednesday afternoon. I   m  sorry. They have come to the house to talk, so you   re just going to have  to   I can, do you want me to send them away? I can send them away.  Will they go?  Oh, yeah. They will. Okay. (Laughs)  Moves and shoos the hens away  and returns to seat   So tell me about the first time you presented a bill on the floor.  Well I tried to get one out of committee and it failed miserably. And I  can   t even remember what that one was, but I just thought it was the  greatest thing yet and I couldn   t even get it out of committee. It bombed  out in committee. I was primarily committed to women   s and children   s  issues and education   naturally I would be   and to tourism   I mean, to  that part because that was my background, recreation     Good fit.     and it was a good one. In fact, the last two years I was chairman of  Tourism and that   s why I brought something down to show you if you  want me to     Okay.     a little bit later, but I brought   I was chairman of Tourism the last  two years, and I passed a bill   the first bill   I   m trying to think what  the first bill was I carried, and I can   t even really remember what it was  right now. I know one bill that I carried that I was very passionate about  was   I can tell you about that one     Okay.     and it was   I felt that when a child had been abused or something had  happened to a child that was traumatic, I felt that it would be sufficient  for the child to tell the story to a video, and it be videoed, and then the  child not be put back through that trauma again to have to repeat what  14  Finchum  Floyd  Finchum  Floyd  had happened to them for the judge for this, that and other things. I was  the author of that bill, and it would be allowing video testimony or  depositions to be used, or stories to be used when you had a   maybe a  sex offender or something of that sort, to keep the child from having to  tell the story over and over or to be questioned over and over. And it  passed both chambers and it   in fact, it passed and the governor signed  it, and it was declared unconstitutional. You always have the right to  face your accuser. And I still think it   s wrong. I still think it   s wrong. I  think there needs to be some sort of differentiation there for children. I  really feel that there should be, and I feel like that a child shouldn   t have  to repeat that story over and over and over or be questioned by different  people. I mean, it just stands to reason they   re going to get confused. It   s  going to leave a mark, especially in the case of abuse or that sort of  thing. But that was one I was really disappointed in that it was and I  think they   re making some inroads in that very thing, but I don   t know.  It says that you will always have the right to face your accuser and so     then I carried   oh, I carried one bill to make stealing fish a crime.  Stealing fish?  Stealing fish a crime   people didn   t know   I mean, you get the  strangest things. Dunn   s Fish Farm which is down at Fittstown down  here   well, they raise fish and put in places. Well, they sell them, and  people were coming in to the fish farm and stealing fish (Laughs) and so  they said,    We can   t do anything about it because stealing fish is not a  crime.    You could go out and fish anyplace, as long as it   and so, that  was one of the ones that was kind of funny. I got kidded a whole bunch  about that. Then the other bill that I carried   do you want me to go  ahead about bills?  Yes.  The other bill that I carried was fun and it was just a wonderful thing to  do. (Laughs) It was a wonderful thing to do, and so   the other bill that I  carried that was such a delightful bill to carry, and there   s kind of a story  behind it. When I was in high school, my science teacher was Dr. Doyle  McCoy. When I started teaching at the university, Dr. Doyle McCoy had  moved to the university   well, when I was a student at the university.  Because I went to East Central as an undergrad   Dr. Doyle McCoy was  the science teacher there, so I had botany with Dr. Doyle McCoy   had  him in high school, then had him in college. And then when I came back  and started teaching, I taught with him several years. Well, I got elected  to the Senate then and here comes this little knock on my door one day  and there is Dr. Doyle McCoy on my door and he says   he   s a botanist,  he was a botanist   and he said,    We need a state flower that we can  grow that will be pretty.    He said,    The mistletoe is, of course, a parasite  15  and it can   t be grown, and Oklahoma needs a state wildflower,    and I  said,    Well, I think that   s great, Dr. McCoy.    I didn   t know what I was  going to do, so anyway   so Dr. McCoy said,    Let   s see what we can  do.     So we looked at different things, and we came up with the Indian  Blanket and him being a botanist, he thought that was wonderful  because Indian Blankets grow all over this part of the country. So it was  the way a bill is supposed to be done   I carried the bill in the Senate,  and Kelly Haney, who   s the renowned artist today, the Indian   and also  right now the principal chief of the Seminole nation. Well, he was in the  House at that time, and Kelly Haney carried it in the House and I carried  it in the Senate, and Dr. McCoy lobbied every one of the House   all 101  House members   and all 48 Senators   he lobbied all of them, and when  I introduced the bill, and when Kelly introduced the bill, it passed with  flying colors. Of course, we got a little kidding over it. George Nigh was  Governor still.  George Nigh was Governor the first two years I was in the Senate, and  Henry Bellmon was the Governor the last two years I was in the Senate.  George came to me at   and George by the way went to college, we  were college chums at East Central. George was a history major at East  Central when I was a physical education major at East Central, so we  went back a long time. And George came to me and he says,    Slats,    my  nickname was    Slats    and anybody that says    Slats,    immediately,  you   ll know who it is. So anyway, he says,    Slats, I don   t really think  you want to do that.    He said,    I know it   s a good idea, but       he said,        you know I carried    Oklahoma    to make that our state song and,    he  said,    I got ridiculed,    and he said,    That   s   everybody knows I   m the  one that introduced the music for our state song.    He said,    Do you want  to do it?    I said,    Well, yeah, I think I do. Dr. McCoy wants it done.    So  I carried the bill and sure enough it passed.  Here   s a picture of it when it was signed and, of course, there I am and  there   s Betty Price who is the Director of the Arts now at the present  time, George Nigh, Abe Hesser who was the Tourism director at that  time, Kelly Haney, and then there   s Dr. McCoy. That was at the bill  signing and you can see Betty had us   we had a blanket that had all of  the pretty colors on it that the Indian Blanket has in it and there   s the  sign, the picture there. And Kelly painted then this picture to make this  the official picture of the Indian Blanket and   can you see that? And  these were prints that were made and supposedly Print No. 1 is supposed  to be in the Governor   s mansion. I don   t know where it is today, but it  was supposed to be. But Kelly Haney did this one for us and not only  that, but then he carried the bill also in the House   so that was a fun  thing to do.  16  Finchum  Floyd  Finchum  Floyd  Finchum  Floyd  Another fun thing that we did was Helen and Bernice and myself, we  were the three women in the Senate there, and this picture was made in  Guthrie because the Senate went to Guthrie to the original statehouse  there and we passed a bill. It was sort of a symbolic thing that we did,  and it was sort of to go down in history that we were passing the bill  there, and it was in 1985,    Convention Center Hall, Guthrie, Oklahoma,  May 14, 1985,    and we actually passed a bill there and then brought it  back and it went through all the other steps that it was supposed to go. It  was just sort of a housekeeping thing that we did, but it was fun working  with Bernice and Helen, they were neat people to work with.  Okay.  Want me to show you another one while we   re doing this?  Sure.  Then toward the end of my term there, I carried the bill   and it may  have been one of the things that helped get me defeated   in fact, it may  have been. I carried a 1/10 of one percent sales tax that went to tourism,  and it allows the Department of Tourism 1/10 of one percent on every  kind of recreational activity   hotels, motels, water skiing rental, boat  rental   anything that is a recreational activity. There   s 1/10 of one  percent that is supposed to go to the Tourism Department so that we can  do advertising decently, and it   s still in effect of course. Abe Hesser was  the Director of Tourism at the time, and these were some of the posters  that were done.  We   d only had Oklahoma Today as a publication at that time, and so this  has allowed Tourism to do more than they could have done, and that was  when I was Chairman of Tourism the last two years that we did that. But  I was severely criticized for it. Oh yes, I was a tax hog. I mean whenever  you vote, that   s another thing that you   ll soon find out that anytime you  vote, you   re probably redistributing money, whatever you   re doing.  You   re taking money from one pot and putting it in another or one  pocket and putting it in another pocket. One of the most bitter fights that  was done when I was there was between the rural electric co-ops and  OG E   I mean, and it was, boy, it was a bitter battle. And it was  overturned. They   re awesome competitors, and it   s funny. I mean, any  vote, regardless of how innocent it may sound, it   s either going to create  some money or take some money away, or do something with money.  So whoever   s the chair of Appropriations has a tough row to hoe.  Very important. (Laughs)  17  Finchum  Floyd  Finchum  Floyd  Finchum  Floyd  So where was your office? We   ll switch gears a little bit. Do you  remember?  Oh, started out on the fourth floor and got moved to the third floor  though, so I could just run into the chamber. All freshmen were  relegated to the fourth floor when we first started. The lower you are on  the pecking order, the further you are away from the activity and so I  was on the third floor all three years after that. That was   I can   t  remember three-something on that side, but it was quite an honor to get  to move down to the third floor. And I even got some new furniture  when I did   not new, it was new to me   it was old furniture that went  to   it was somebody else   s furniture, it was that kind of thing. But that  was kind of exciting for when you got chairmanship, and of course I was  chairman of Tourism.  Well, after hours, once the session ended     Okay.     what did you do after hours?  Okay, usually the session went   usually then after the session was over,  and it was according to how many bills we had to pass that day, how  long it lasted. And also I was there when we could go all night. We  covered the clock and we could stay from then on   at the end of session  when it came time to do sign or die, I mean we could have stayed there  all week with the clock covered. We did not have to adjourn at a  particular time. We could go on until July 4th if the leadership wanted us  to do it. When you got through with your work, then I usually went in  the office and that   s when you worked with your secretary, you saw  constituents, you did your letters, and you got stuff ready for the next  day and all. Then being up there by yourself, I usually hung around the  office.  The thing that was so different for me was on Monday, Tuesday and  Wednesday evenings. The lobbyists always had a reception, some  lobbyists did. Some you went to, some you didn   t, according to whether  it was somebody in your district or something that you needed to go to.  It was usually held close someplace to the Capitol. And, there was never  ever any lobbyist that would ever say,    I expect you to vote for this.     They might come by your office and try to explain their side of a bill,  but I have never had any of them even talk or leave the impression that  they were trying to influence or strong-arm or anything of that sort you  into voting for something. But you could always call a lobbyist and say,     Now, tell me. What   s your take on this?       and then that way if you  were smart enough to know that there was OG E here and Rural  18  Finchum  Floyd  Electric co-ops here, or there were farmers here and something else over  here, you could get the different sides of the story, and you could do  that. So as a result, why that would be something that you might, that  you   d use. But they would always have a reception and it didn   t last  long. It was always just go by and they   d have snacks and, of course,  there was usually something to drink, and I was always very, very  careful about that.  I   m not a wild teetotaler. I mean a glass of wine   s not going to kill you,  but I was very, very careful about that. I never had any of my colleagues  ever get out of line. I was never   in fact, there would be occasion where  it was someplace, maybe in downtown Oklahoma City where there  would be someone that would say,    Would you like to ride down there  with me?    If it was someplace, that we were going go that might be kind  of bad getting back in the car to come back to the Capitol to go home or  something but never, ever was anybody ever   oh, said anything. Well,  we can talk about that one when you ask me probably another question  about how you deal with remarks that you don   t approve of.  Just go ahead. You   re there.  I   m already there? Okay. Well, I mean you   re going to run into that. I  mean, after all, there were three of us there and the men are going to say  things, and it has been a man   s world. That   s all there is to it, up there.  And they   ve had this exclusive club that   s been their very own. So there  are going to be things that are going to be said and things that are going  to be done that are not quite like you   d like to have it. Sometimes it   s  nice to be deaf and dumb. When I say deaf and dumb, blind and not  hear   sometimes that   s the best way to handle it. That   s what I used to  always tell my teachers,    When you have a child that   s doing something  that you want to discipline them about, be sure you know how you   re  going to do the discipline. Have a plan of action there and be sure that  you   re going to come out on top when you get ready to start that battle  with that child or with whoever it is, and if you can   t handle it then,  maybe you need to let that go and come back the next time it happens  and get your ducks lined up so that you can do what needs to be done.     But if you react to every little thing that   s said and done, you   re going to  come off as   well, you   re just not going to be effective. You can   t be  effective if you   re going around picking a fight over every little thing  that   s said and done. You just can   t do it, so there   s times when you  need to sort of look the other way or not hear what somebody says or  sometimes,    Oh,    have this deer in the headlights look      Oh, really   I  don   t understand,    and then turn around and walk off. And then when  you get ready then, do something about it.  19  Finchum  Floyd  Finchum  Floyd  Finchum  Floyd  Finchum  Floyd  Finchum  Floyd  Finchum  Floyd  Back to the very beginning when we were talking about the Equal  Rights Amendment and the oldest daughter applying for vet school and  she wasn   t accepted the first time. And I felt probably   this was back at  the vet school   it was the majority   it was just beginning to have  women in the vet school, and I think that was probably something then  and that was another thing, I thought,    By crackies, if she wants to go to  vet school, that   s why we need that Equal Rights Amendment so that sex  shouldn   t enter into that if she   s capable of doing it.     That was in the eighties, too? Mid-eighties?  So it was   it all was there. And I   ve talked to Susan Paddack who is a     Senator Paddack who is our senator now. I was involved in her  campaign. I was one of the first people she came to and talked about it  and I told her some things that she would need to be able to do and not  do. But Susan   lost my train of thought there about   I was going to talk  about her and the Equal Rights Amendment, I guess is what it was. Ask  me a question then.  Were you the first woman from the district then to win?  Oh, yes.  And you beat an incumbent that had been in     About three or four terms, yeah.  Several terms.  Yeah.  And then she followed you so you kind of     No, no. There was a man between us.  Between you?  Dick Wilkerson was between us. When Dick Wilkerson ran against  me    when I was defeated, he spent well over  100,000. He and his  brother had been involved in    Someone Cry for the Children.     Remember the three scouts that were abducted and killed up in the Tulsa  area, at camp. Dick   s brother, who was an OSBI  Oklahoma State  Bureau of Investigation  agent, and Dick was in law enforcement also     that was a big thing   victims    rights and taking care of   that became a  big issue in the campaign. He distributed videos. He was one of the first  politicians   and I have the video in there   he made a video of his life. I  20  Finchum  Floyd  mean, it was clever. He was an awesome campaigner   great   and he  made a video of his life. And he had been in the war and was a recon-something-  or-other, and whoever did it   it was well done and patriotic.  You stood up and cried and put your hand over your heart and saluted  the flag. It was a wonderful. And he had these made and passed them out  like candy.  They were passed out.    Take this home and invite people over to your  house to see it.    It   s a wonderful campaign tool in the rural areas. It   s  great. And I don   t know why more politicians don   t use it today because  it would be wonderful to do if you   ve got that kind of money. Plus, he  passed out the book, Someone Cry for the Children, and it told all about  how they prosecuted and got the old boy and all. Those were also passed  out, not to mention the other stuff, but he spent well over  100,000 on  the campaign. Just unbelievable. There was no way. First of all I was not  going to go in debt myself. It was not worth that to me. He had a  machine in place and I was beaten fair and square. He ran on some  issues that were really emotional.  And he didn   t win the second time either. Did he run the second term?  The second time he didn   t have an opponent, but then he won. Then  term limits got him. No, he was term-limited out. I   m not criticizing  him. I can   t take from him because he   s a law and order candidate and  he appealed to men   very appealing to the man and to the law and order  man and to the NRA  National Rifle Association  and, of course, I   m as  good a shot as anybody. I quail hunt. I pheasant hunt. I can hold my own  with anybody with a gun, and I   m not opposed to guns at all. Hey, I was  raised a tomboy, and that   s one of the things you   I got a .22 for my  thirteenth birthday. That was a part of growing up, going squirrel  hunting and so on and so forth with my dad, rabbit hunting with my dad.  But times have changed.  Oh, I know what I was going to tell you. When I ran, abortion, which is  always an issue, I can remember talking to a civic club and someone  asked me about the abortion issue. Remember this was    84, and I said,     Abortion is an issue that should be solved by the woman and her doctor  and her God, and that   s where it should be handled, right there. If she  has some family members involved, that   s okay      but I said,    That is  her decision that she should make with her body,    and I could get away  with it. And I said,    It   s not your right or my right or anybody else   s  right.    I said,    Abortion is an individual issue,    and I said,    If you  believe that there is a wonderful heaven where there are no tears and no  pain and no suffering, then how can you be so opposed to a little child  that might be brought into this world and abused or neglected or starved  or something happen to them   if that happens to be the decision that  21  Finchum  Floyd  Finchum  Floyd  Finchum  Floyd  Finchum  Floyd  Finchum  Floyd  Finchum  Floyd  Finchum  Floyd  they   re just going to heaven a little early?    I said,    How can you be  opposed to that? It   s going to happen to all of us sometime, so why are  you opposed, if you really believe that there is that wonderful place  where it   s happy from now on.    I could get away with it. Today I don   t  know whether a woman candidate could even get away with that. I don   t  know.  I don   t know either.  I just don   t know whether they could, and I still feel very passionate  about it. I feel very strongly about it, and I don   t think that anybody  should criticize anybody else on that. It   s something you have to live  with and make that decision on, you know     Have you noticed any other differences, like gender differences similar  to that? Any other     Like?  Some of your supporters were women     The women the second time around did not vote for me.  Did not. That   s interesting, isn   t it?  Uh-huh. There were many of them that felt like, when they really  discovered I was a woman and I was doing a good job, my picture was  in the paper, I was doing things   I needed to be home with my husband.  I didn   t need to be out doing those things. So there were a lot of  women   and especially the religious right.  Well, that   s changed some since then since Susan  Paddack  was  elected, too?  A little so, but you still find that in this part of the country. There   re very  conservative religious sects still feel very strongly that a woman   s place  should not be out front.  So gender is still an issue?  Yes.  As much as geography or age?  Probably so   probably so. I mean, that probably has something to do  with it. Of course, I do things, now, that somebody not as old as I am  22  Finchum  Floyd  Finchum  Floyd  Finchum  Floyd  Finchum  Floyd  couldn   t do.  Interesting. (Laughs)  I mean, I think I do. And, of course, I probably express my opinion on  things right now where other women might not do it but I do right now. I  do.  You   re doing fine. (Laughs)  So anyway, as you can see, I do have some ideas. Go ahead.  No, you   re doing fine. If you had to pick one moment during the  campaign that just sticks out, do you have one   a campaign story?  Well, let me think.  If not a campaign then, while you were in the Senate, anything that  just     Oh, yes, the one in the Senate was funny. I   ve got this article from the  New York Times upstairs because it was written up in the New York  Times and I really got kidded and kidded and kidded about it. Okay,  what happened was   oh, fiddlesticks   this Don Nichols  U.S. Senator  Don Nichols    Don Rickles, I called him. Okay, Don Nichols was in  Okemah which was in my senate district, and he was talking to a group  of people in Okemah. He was talking to them about all these things and  something came up about fish, hunting, wildlife, something   and he  said,    Oh,    he said,    That is a state issue. You should talk to your  senator about that.    And somebody in the audience said,    Billie Floyd?     He  Nichols  said,    Oh, yes. I know him   I know him.    And, of course,  everybody just hee-hawed right then because I was really pretty popular  in Okemah, and so they just      Oh     He looked at them and they said,     No, no, Senator Nichols. He is a she,    and, of course, Senator Nichols  just turned red. They really gave him a bad time because he said,    Oh, I  know him. I know him well.    And they just howled because Senator  Nichols didn   t know him well because him was a she   so that was one.  And then it was written up in the New York Times, the story was, of  Nichols and him doing that gaffe, up there. They presented it to me on  the floor of the Senate. I think Ben Brown had it framed and gave it to  me. I   ve got all my senate stuff hanging upstairs. I   ve got a little office  at the top of the stair landing there, and it   s hanging up there on the wall.  But that was a fun thing.  Oh, something not to do when you   re campaigning   would you like to  23  Finchum  Floyd  Finchum  Floyd  Finchum  Floyd  Finchum  Floyd  Finchum  Floyd  hear about that?  Sure.  Oh, I had my best foot forward, and I was just going,    Oh, how are  you?    You know, shaking hands,    Yes, yes. How are you?       Billie  Floyd. Please vote for me,    you know, and    Oh, what a pretty little kid,     you know      Oh, gosh, those are great eyes.    Oh, boy, I tell you what, I  was just campaigning, doing my best, just going down the line just  saying    How are you?    and all. And I get to this lady and her husband  here and she   s got on this flowing caftan, and I said,    Oh, and when are  you expecting?    She looked at me.    I am not.    I don   t think I got her  vote. I don   t think I got either one of their votes. I mean, I learned a  lesson. I knew better   I knew better. I just did it. You just get to rolling  and I did it. But that was one and there are probably some other stories. I  love to give speeches, and I really never did get into a crowd where I  was heckled or anything like that.  Did your daughters do any campaigning for you?  Oh, yes   yes, everybody. My husband was a sign-maker. I had a cousin  that lived in   well, Calvin over here that helped Ben  Floyd   s husband   put out signs. It was all family. My son-in-law, he helped put out signs  when he could. I think they were living in Ponca City at the time. But  everybody worked, and I had lots of friends and colleagues that pitched  in. It was all strictly a   nobody was paid   it was strictly if you wanted  to do it, okay, but no paid employees on this one, at all.  So election night?  Oh, election night was wonderful. Election night was just, oh, it was  great. We just had a wonderful   we had people   I don   t know how  many, hundreds of people were there. It was really a people   s campaign.  I mean, everybody was there and it was just     There, as in here or     Oh, here   we were here in Ada. Oh, yes, we were here in Ada and they  all drove in from every place. From Colgate and from Atwood and from  Okemah and from all of the area. I had six counties. There were six  counties then.  A lot of miles then.  Yes   Pontotoc, Coal, Murray, Okfuskee, Hughes   all of Hughes, all of  Pontotoc and all of Coal   and then parts of three others. So, yes it was  24  Finchum  Floyd  Finchum  Floyd  Finchum  Floyd  quite a celebration. It really and truly was and then, as I say, when I  went up to the Capitol and was sworn-in, it was something. I don   t think  they   ve ever had anything like it. But I like people and I hope they felt  like they were a part of it.  Well, if the gallery was full    (Laughs)  It was a good time   it was a good time.  So what have you done since leaving office?  Oh, my   you really want to know? Okay, I left office. I came back. I   m  not one that disappeared off the face of the earth. I   m still very active. I  work now. I still work for the university. I do first-year residency  teacher supervision for the university. I am active in historical  preservation. I work with the U.S. Census Bureau. I do interviews for  the U.S. Census Bureau, and I   ve been doing that for about six or seven  years, I guess, now. And I   m involved in projects, all kinds of projects.  Right now I   m working with the 9-1-1 signage. I   m working with trying  to restore some historical things. Ada has not really kept up with  restoring and keeping their historical things, so we   re working on that.  What else do I do? I have two wonderful grandsons. My youngest  daughter, Amy, and Russ are back here in Ada now. Russ is in  investments and Amy teaches fourth grade. Both girls said they would  never teach   ever. Their mother and dad were both teachers, and they  would never, ever teach school. Carey is   Dr. Carey Floyd is the  director of the vet-tech program at Murray State College, and so she is in  education, and Amy B Allen   Amy B Floyd Allen is a fourth-grade  teacher at Washington Elementary here in Ada   two grandsons, Jesse  and Joel. Jesse is almost a junior at East Central and is very active in  student activities, student affairs. Either one of my grandsons could  either be a politician or a preacher, just take your choice, because they  both like to perform. And the youngest one is a junior in high school and  plays football   plays left tackle on Ada High   s football team. He   s also  on the moot court team this year at the high school, so he will be doing  the legal competition. We   re all excited about that and that   s going to be  a fun thing.  He may be the politician of the family   the next one.  He may very well be. Yes, as I say   preacher or politician, just take  your choice. But they   re fun and they live close by and I see them often  and they help with things. I lost my husband three years ago, and I still  am very active and do all kinds of things and     25  Finchum  Floyd  Finchum  Floyd  Finchum  Thoughts of running again?  Oh, well, in fact they called the other day. Just as you mentioned that     they called the other day and they are looking for someone. I was very  fortunate when I was in the Senate. Lonnie Abbott was the House  member that shared this district, and Lonnie had been there since   I  mean, he had a great deal of seniority in the House. You asked about  things that were surprising. When I was there a freshman, I remember  one night Representative Lonnie Abbott walking across the rotunda and  saying to me,    Well, I   ve just put  200,000 in a bill for the Vo-tech  school there in Ada. You   d better take care of it in the Senate.    And I  said,    What?    I said,    What?    He said,    Take care of it in the Senate.  You can do it.    And I   m thinking,    How do I take care of  200,000 in  the Senate in the budget in appropriations?    You know, I mean      What  do I do?    So I got through it. We had the Vo-tech school here in Ada  and those are things that you learn. But again, the political scene has  changed. He could do that because he had been there so long and the  democrats were so in charge of the House of Representatives. He could  do that, and you couldn   t do that today.  So they called me about   back to my story, they called me two or three  weeks ago from the House of Representatives looking for someone to  run against the republican that   s in the House now. They said,    Can   t  you find someone to do this?    Well, and I said,    I   m not young enough.  I don   t want to      it costs so much money. That   s the other thing that  would take all the fun out of it. If somebody would just say,    Here   s   100,000. Go run.    I   d say,    Okay.     Get your mints and go.  Oh, you bet   you bet. I could do it. And I mean, Pontotoc County would  be a piece of cake to campaign. I mean, I did six counties. Ignorance was  bliss though the first time around. I had no idea how hard it was going to  be and what I was going to have to do. I had no idea. Now I would know  what you   d need to do and, of course, it   s changed so because you have  to use the media so much. And we don   t have a lot of media around  here. It   s mail-outs, hand-outs   we only have a couple of local  television, 12 and 10 are the only television stations. Then you   ve got  your radio stations, and then you   ve got newspapers. Not everybody  takes the newspaper so it   s a different kind of campaigning. But I still  say one-on-one,    My name is Billie Floyd and your vote means a mint to  me and I sure would like for you to vote for me.    And there are people  that want to be asked to vote for you.  Well, you might reconsider and do it anyway one time. (Laughter) No?  Not going to go there? All right. Well, can you see positive and negative  26  Floyd  aspects to having served?  Oh, the positive is wonderful. I grew. I learned. Okay. Now this is just  like   do you remember when Clarence Thomas was being confirmed?  Right now, of course, that   s going on right now because his book has  just been released. Clarence Thomas was confirmed. Okay, the judiciary  committee had to confirm his appointment by the President to the  Supreme Court, okay. Remember the blood bath that took place? Do you  remember that? Okay. We watched it. I told the people that knew me,  having been just at the state level   the President of the United States  told the judiciary committee, he told them, he said,    I want him   Thomas  confirmed. I don   t care what happens. I don   t want to be  involved in it, but you get the job done. I don   t care whose head rolls. I  want him on the Supreme Court, and do not involve me.    They were  mostly republicans. It was a republican president. They did it. I saw that  at a lesser level at the state level when the governor would say,    I want  that done. I don   t want to be involved in it. I don   t want my name with  it. It   s your committee. You   re appointed to that committee. That   s your  job. I want it done.    And that   s where your party politics   and, I mean,  there would be no way that I can prove that that story is true, but scouts  honor I   ll bet you a nickel it is.  I mean, and it   s just like we were talking about Anita Hill, and I really  admired Anita Hill. I really did, and I still do because I think the lady  was probably telling the truth, and she got brought in. She didn   t want to  be brought in, but they brought her in. I mean, she was brought into that  and not by the ones that were trying to get the confirmation done. It was  by the other side that said,    You   ve got to come in on this.    And I said,     If she were going to make up a story, she   s a smart lady. She would  have certainly made a better story than a pubic hair on a coke can up as  her story.    I mean she would have made a better story up if she were  going to go in there and lie about something. I think the poor gal was  telling the truth. I saw her on television the other day. They interviewed  her. Did you see her on one of the morning shows? She was  absolutely   she said,    I   m not going there.    She said,    What I did has  opened the workplace up to women today to be able to not be  discriminated or talked to or that sort of thing.    She said,    That was a  step in our growth and our development. That was a necessary thing  apparently to happen.    And she said,    I   m not going there. I   m not  talking about his book. I stand on my testimony and that   s all I   ll say  about that.    But she said,    My actions have made a difference in the  workplace for women today.    And she said,    If that   s what came from it,  then that is worth it.    And I mean, I was just awed because I thought,     Oh, gosh. She is a class act.    And she really   so that was one of the  things. Oh, I had an opportunity to serve with Vicki Miles-LaGrange.  27  Finchum  Floyd  Finchum  Floyd  Finchum  Floyd  Finchum  Floyd  Finchum  Floyd  I interview her in a couple of weeks.  You do? Oh, you tell Vicki Miles hello. She was delightful. And then  Maxine Horner.  I haven   t been able to get her yet.  I think she   s had some health problems   but Vicki Miles-LaGrange, I  certainly admired her. I never will forget we were talking about the  flags. The confederate flag was always an issue, especially with blacks  and southern people and that sort of thing, and I remember her saying  her feelings on that. And that   s another thing that bothers me. Today we  get so upset   to me, an intelligent politician, it   s okay if they change  their mind. If they have supported or made a mistake, why in the world  can they not say,    That was wrong. I did the wrong thing. Now, I want  to   yes, I   m changing.    But if you grow and become more intellectual  or more enlightened on something and change a position, they  immediately think you   re a wishy-washy and they just crucify you for it.  I think that   s wrong. I think that   s wrong because there are lots of things  that you might not understand this year, but you might understand it a  couple years from now. It   s like me, I mean, I grew. I am thankful every  day for being able to be in the Senate. I just   oh, I tell you, it was  wonderful, and I learned   oh, I learned so many things  I made friends.  I just wouldn   t take for it. I would not take for it.  Do you stay in touch with any of the women that served with you?  A little, not a great deal. I   m not a big one to do a lot of that   I mean  like     Christmas cards?     classmates and Christmas cards and I don   t do a lot of that. I guess I  probably   I don   t know   I   m too busy doing other things, and I   m just  not much on that. Maybe it   s a bad thing, but lots of people do.  Is there anything else I need to ask that I haven   t, that you can think of?  Oh, gosh, I don   t know. There   s probably, and I   ll think of a jillion  things I wish I could have told you. I couldn   t have done it without my  family. I have a sister  Mary Lou  who was absolutely magnificent.  She   s my older sister and she was wonderful. She was the one that has  always pushed me. Back to my early childhood, my mother and father  were just wonderful parents. Our mother, even though she was a stay-at-home  mom, she was one that always said,    Well, you can go do that.  You can do that.    She was really   and my sis is one of those kinds of  28  Finchum  Floyd  Finchum  Floyd  Finchum  Floyd  Finchum  Floyd  Finchum  Floyd  Finchum  Floyd  people. So me, coming along and they laughed and they said,    Well,  when you came along, Mom and Dad just let you do anything you  wanted to do.    Well, I don   t know about that   but I did come along at a  wonderful time and     How far did your mother go in high school? Did she complete     Oh, no, no. Mom and Dad neither one   eighth or ninth   I mean, they  went as far as they could go in school at that time. It was probably  seventh, eighth or ninth grade   somewhere along there.  Did your sister go to college, too?  My sister graduated college   master   s degree   and my brother also     and my brother taught some, but did not stay with teaching. My dad  worked for the Railway Express Company. We were fortunate enough  during those Depression years, he had a job. Later my dad went into  construction, houses and that sort of thing, building houses   and my  brother went with him, but you know that was later. But, no, Mom and  Dad, my dad was an excellent   I mean, he could add up figures faster  than we could, you know, and that kind of thing. They were both self-taught,  you know, and right was right and wrong was wrong. Neither  one were extremely fanatics on a religious thing or on anything. Mom  used to say,    You can make bad out of anything.    She said,    You can  overdo anything.    That was one of the things that we were   moderation  or temperance on things were always good. I think that was another  thing that has tempered the way I look at things   harm out of eating,  harm out of going to church, harm out of whatever you want to do. You  can overdo something.  Had they already passed when you were elected?  Yes and I hated that, and my aunt had, too. I really wished that they  could have been here to have seen that. They would have been thrilled     They were watching, just not in the room.  Yes.  Up there somewhere     Yes, you bet. Can you think of anything else that you need to ask?  I   m sure I   ll think of something as I go up the road, too.  So, I   m still very active. I still do all of the things and   I was just trying  29  Finchum  Floyd  Finchum  Floyd  Finchum  Floyd  Finchum  Floyd  to think what else   oh, I   ve had an antique shop, but I didn   t like that  because you had to stay home and I decided that wasn   t any fun so I  turned my garage   that log cabin is where the people originally lived  that built this house, and from the two-story part forward is a log and so,  I   ve lived here fifty years, fifty-plus years. Kind of been here a little  while, so   one of those things, but     Any plans to retire? No?  No   no   no   no   no.  Did you get to travel when you were in the Senate?  Oh, yes   yes. I did. I got to go to the meetings where   the Southern  Leadership Conference, I believe it was. I think that   s what it   s called. I  got to go to California, which I   d never been, to one, and then got to go  to   I think it was Louisville, Kentucky to one. They usually alternate     and that   s where you go and you see what other states are doing and you  find out about their bills and what   s passed and what hasn   t passed   and  it kind of keeps everything going. Those were really good. They were  really good. Susan, our senator now, she   s doing a good job. She   s really  doing a great job with that sort of thing.  And so what kind of activities in the political arena are you currently  doing? Anything?  Well, I just   of course, I talk to her  Susan Paddack  all the time and     Moral support.  Yes and she says,    It   s so nice to talk to you because you understand  what   s going on and why I   ve been doing these things and why I   m  pulling my hair out, when you can   t get things done.    And I belong to  the democratic local party. I think one of those questions was how much  did the Democratic Party or did your party influence your election? Not  a great deal. They did not get involved a great deal. It   s a given thing  that in the primary, your parties do not get involved   or at least the  democrats don   t get involved in the primary. If you   ve got two  democrats running in the primary, they don   t do anything until it gets to  the general election. By the time it got to the general election, well, I  mean, there we were   and they still didn   t do a great deal that I knew of  at that point in time. But other counties and other places might be more  active than ours was then. Lou and Wes  Watkins  were very active  when I got elected. They were here and they were big strong democrats.  So that may have been some help, too, because Lou and Wes Watkins  were here then and they were democrats at that time and that might have  30  Finchum  Floyd  Finchum  Floyd  Finchum  Floyd  Finchum  Floyd  Finchum  helped.  Okay. My last thing is   if you don   t have anything else   is when history  is written about you, what would you like for it to say?  (Laughter) Oh, that she did her best to make this place a little better off  for future generations. It   s kind of like just the other day I heard  Governor Bellmon being interviewed on OETA  Oklahoma Educational  Television Authority , and he was asked what   s the difference between a  politician and a statesman. And Governor Bellmon said,    A politician  looks forward to the next election. A statesman looks forward to the next  generation.     Did you want to say anything about your advice for women who are  considering politics?  (Laughter) Well, I say, hey, if you like people   you   ve got to like  people     Okay.  You have got to like people and you   ve got to enjoy dealing with  conflict and confusion because politics is making a silk purse out of a  sow   s ear. (Laughs) That   s just about what it is because you   ve got the  awful-est mess usually in so many cases and then you   ve got to figure  out ways to make this work or to hurt the least amount of people with  what you do. I mean that   s the other bad thing about it because  somebody so many times gets hurt or disappointed or something when  you make those decisions. You   ve got to be strong   you   ve got to be  strong, and you can   t afford to let people talking about you bother you  because they   re going to talk about you   good or bad, they   re going to  talk about you now. You can   t let that bad get you down because you   re  not going to keep all those people happy all the time. And that was the  other thing that was kind of disappointing. I   ve heard people say, when  you   re a politician,    Well, it   s not what you did yesterday that counts.  It   s what you   re going to do for me today.    Hand-out kind of thing, you  know. Right now, I   m listening to The Worst Hard Years. Have you read  it?  I   ve started it. I haven   t gotten too far into it.  Well, see, that   s one of the things that I do. You will absolutely   it   s  just a marvelous book, and when I drive so much   I mean, I   ll drive 200  miles a day   I   ve gotten hooked on audio books.  I need to do that, too, since you   ve said that.  31  Floyd  Finchum  Floyd  Finchum  Floyd  Finchum  Floyd  Finchum  Floyd  Finchum  Floyd  Finchum  Floyd  Finchum  Floyd  Finchum  Floyd  Finchum  Floyd  Oh, you do because if you can drive and listen at the same time. And, I  mean, that one and then of course Tim Russert   s book.  I   ve read several of his having to do with his father.  Oh, that   s the one   that   s the one. The one of his dad, that   s Big Russ or  Big     Big Russ and Me, isn   t it?  Big Russ and Me, yes, and you   ll cry.  I did.  You   ll cry. I mean it is just   oh, I just love it. And then, of course, Doris  Kearns Goodwin   s book on Abraham Lincoln. Have you done that one?  No. I haven   t done that one. I   ll put that on the list.  Well, you need that one because that one is just absolutely   it   s just  great   and then go on and listen to Brokeback Mountain. Have you read  Brokeback Mountain?  No. I   ve watched the movie. (Laughs)  Well, you need to read the book   you need to hear   I love her. She is  absolutely   oh, I love her books. They   re wonderful.  Well, that   s from my neck of the woods, too, from western North  Carolina is where that was written. Was that   is that right?  No, no, no, no. It   s in Wyoming.  No?  Brokeback Mountain is in Wyoming.  I   m thinking of Cold Mountain then.  What?  Cold Mountain.  Cold Mountain is the one you   re thinking about. No, Brokeback  Mountain is in Wyoming and Arizona   I mean, it   s the mountain states  and   oh, I tell you, she is the most    She did Shipping News, Brokeback  32  Finchum  Floyd  Mountain, and Ace in the Hole was the other one that she   s done. But  you need to listen to Brokeback Mountain. It   s only one little CD  unabridged and, I mean, it   s   forget the homosexual thing   it is a story  that you   it   s just one of those stories that you just   it makes you  understand people and how people, their lives, things that happen to  them, that happen and just how it affects the things that they do and  what   s going to happen. I just love her. She   s just so good   but Doris  Kearns Goodwin is great, too, so     It   s good for a librarian to hear these things, that you   re actually  reading books or listening to them.  Oh, oh, I tell you. What   s the one about Abraham Lincoln?  Referring to  Team of Rivals  Oh, I always forget the title of that one. This grey hair     that   s the bad thing.  I didn   t mention one other person that was very, very instrumental and  very important in my Senate career, and that was Glen Johnson. Glen  Johnson was my other House member from Okemah when I was in the  Senate. Glen was in the House at the time I was elected. Then he became  Speaker of the House, and he was wonderful. He   s just a wonderful  mediator, always   he taught me so many things to be just a kid. And I  still   his mother lives in Okemah   and she and the crew in Okemah are  just   they were wonderful to me. And then Glen went from there to the  President of Southeastern at Durant and now he   s Chancellor of Higher  Education. So Glen is one of the ones that just absolutely   he   s a  wonderful mediator. He just does a great job of bringing people together  and working things out so that you try to give everybody a little piece of  the pie. He   s real good and oh, he   s so good at that   so good   and a  funny storyteller.  I   ve already told you two or three jokes. The one that I always remember  about that is, we   d always get up at a political speaking and he   d say he  was going down the street campaigning and he was telling these people,     I sure do hope you   ll vote for me,    and he got to this old guy and he  says,    Well, I tell you what. I   what   s your name?    And he   d say,     Glen Johnson.    He said,    I   ll sure vote for you    cause that old boy  we   ve got up there now, he   s not any good,    and of course it was Glen,  you know, and he always tells that joke. I never could tell the funny  jokes like that. The only one that I could tell that was funny was the  pregnant woman, and the other one was we were in Colgate  campaigning one night, and all my friends were with me. Several of my  girlfriends were with me. We were going door-to-door, and we all  gathered at a certain place when it   s all over, and here comes one of my  friends and she   s shaking her pant-leg like this and she said,    You   re  never going to believe this,    and we said,    What are you doing?        33  Finchum  Floyd  Finchum  Floyd  Finchum  Floyd  looked down and she had been knocking on this lady   s door and asking  her to vote for me, and two or three of her dogs came out and wee-wee   d  on her leg. We said,    Well, did you let on?    She said,    I didn   t let on   I  didn   t let on at all. I just asked her to vote for you and left.    We said,     Good, good, good.    (Laughs) So, you never know what   s going to  happen. But anyway, it   s been delightful and if you think of anything  else. I hope that women today will continue and, as I say, I hope that  they   ll do it, do anything they think they want to do that they   re big  enough to do.  Well, there are nineteen in the legislature now.  I know it. Isn   t that exciting? Very exciting.  It is. Well, thank you so much.  Well, thank you for coming.  It   s been my pleasure.  I   m sorry the sound effects were so good. They  the guineas  finally left.  ------ -------
