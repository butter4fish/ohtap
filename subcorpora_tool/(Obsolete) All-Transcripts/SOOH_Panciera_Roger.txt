 Larson  Panciera  Today is December 8, 2009. My name is Mary Larson. We   re here with  Dr. Roger Panciera, and in the background we   ve also got Dr. Sidney  Ewing assisting, and Jacob Sherman doing tech for us. Dr. Panciera,  thank you so much for being here today. We really appreciate your help  with this project. We   re in a unique position, in your case, in that we  already have some earlier interviews dealing with your background. But  before we start talking about the 1957outbreak, I   d like to ask you what  you might remember of some previous outbreaks while you were in vet  med school.  Well, I recall an individual case, I don   t remember where it came from,  but it should   ve been in 1950 or    51, that my roommate and I, under the  direction of Dr. Charlie Barron, did an autopsy on. It was a positive  anthrax case, as it turned out. I   ve always wondered why we got to do it  instead of the faculty. (Laughter) Anyway, I do recall contributing a pair  of shoes and underwear, well, clothing, that was sterilized by  autoclaving, and it shrunk probably six or eight sizes. So, it was gone.  (Laughs)  Were there other security precautions they had you take at that time?  Hell, no. No. I think we probably wore gloves.  Didn   t have to mask up or anything?  Things then were not all that safety-conscious. They were a little bit  primitive. Maybe a lot primitive.  You were here in the vet school   s early years. What were things like at  that time?  I think there were a lot fewer cars and a lot more walking. The school  5  Larson  Panciera  Larson  Panciera  Larson  Panciera  Larson  Panciera  Larson  was very small and surviving pretty much on the edge. Faculty was very  small and dedicated to teaching. Where we   re sitting right now, when I  got here, was stacked up on the street outside, individual bricks and trim,  limestone. There was a veterinary curriculum but not a veterinary  school.  When you would   ve done the autopsy, what were the facilities like?  It was done in a building called TF9, Temporary Frame 9. The major  function of which was, we did it on the anatomy lab floor. I don   t  remember how we cleaned up, but TF9 sat in the space now occupied by  one of the high-rise dorms, just south of the horse barn in those days.  You mentioned that your roommate was involved; who was your  roommate at the time?  Dr. R.E. Williams. Bob Williams. Presently retired from his original  veterinary practice in Moline, Kansas.  Did you do anything further when you were at the vet med school with  any other anthrax outbreaks that you remember?  I remember an outbreak in southern Oklahoma at which quite a few  students in the class ahead of me went down to help with. That   s my  recollection about anthrax before 1957.  Was it a relatively uncommon disease, still, in Oklahoma?  No. Actually, the organism has a self-preservation form, bacterial  spores, and I   ve read stuff that says that those spores will survive for  probably sixty years or more in soil. And what happens is that in warm  weather and  with  drought conditions   I   m not sure I remember how  that goes. There   s rain and then vegetation that rots and provides a  medium for the vegetative proliferation of the organism so it achieves a  concentration in the environment that is an infectious one. I believe it  only takes one anthrax organism to kill a mouse. The LD50 in a mouse  is about one. I don   t know what it is for cattle, but it takes a certain  proliferation of the vegetative phase to build a concentration in the  environment that a cow can acquire an infective dose. That   s what  happens frequently in the summertime here and there in the United  States, actually in the world, I suppose.  I understand with human cases of anthrax, for example, that there   s  respiratory and inhalation and gastrointestinal. Is it different with  livestock? Are the symptoms different?  6  Panciera  Larson  Panciera  Larson  Panciera  As a sort of a dead-animal veterinarian, (Laughter) I don   t know all that  much about symptoms. Symptoms include illness, high fever, maybe  some subcutaneous swellings, very short-course. In other words, the  disease progresses to its end just within a couple days or maybe sooner.  At death, there   s supposed to be blood from body openings and lack of  rigor mortis, stuff like that. In outbreaks after the initial diagnosis is  made, the effort is to get specimens for culture or whatever, without  contaminating an area. The specimen that usually is obtained is blood, a  blood swab.  Let   s talk directly about the    57 anthrax outbreak. My understanding is  that it hit northeastern Oklahoma as well as Kansas. Did it get into  Missouri?  I don   t know. What do I know, or what was my part, in the    57  outbreak? Actually, it wasn   t very much, but on a Sunday we received  specimens from a veterinarian in northeastern Oklahoma, probably  Miami. I don   t recall what his name was, but the specimen was a bundle  of plants. He had gathered some information on one, probably more than  one, animal that had died fairly rapidly, and he was suspicious that the  plants were the cause of the illness and death. I recall that our poisonous  plants person, Dr. Peterson, Dr. Duane Peterson, was on vacation at the  time, but he lived right over here on Admiral Road. I gathered up the  plants and took them to his house. He told me that most of the plants  were sedges and that they were nontoxic, and I reported that to the  Miami veterinarian. In a couple days, he sent animal tissues that we  subjected to culture, bacterial culture, and out grows anthrax. That   s  almost the end of my story because we made the original diagnosis and  prepared to go on vacation to Rhode Island. My interviewer has spent  some time in Rhode Island. We did that and left all the dirty work to  Drs.  Bertis  Glenn and  Paul  Barto, who I   m sure were busy for the  next month processing diagnostic specimens.  When you got that sample in the lab, could you explain for people who  might not know what   s involved in culturing something what was  entailed?  Bacterial culturing involves exposing a culture medium, in this case, a  blood agar plate, which includes agar that solidifies a nutrient medium to  which some blood is added. It solidifies, and a swab, for instance, would  be just dragged across the culture plate, a petri dish. Then it   s put in the  incubator and examined twenty-four, thirty-six hours later. Back then     I   m going to put this in, even though people aren   t going to like it. Back  then, in days before contemporary molecular techniques, we injected  mice with specimens, either from the culture plate or maybe even from  the blood itself. Like I said earlier, two organisms are almost guaranteed  7  Larson  Panciera  Larson  Panciera  Larson  Panciera  Larson  Panciera  to result in fatal mouse disease, and there aren   t many that do that. I   m  not sure what else actually   the colonies that grow on this culture plate  have certain characteristics that, once you know it could be anthrax, the  colonies have visible features that say,    Okay, this is another one of  those that was anthrax yesterday. Today, it   s still anthrax.     So, there hadn   t been any in-the-field diagnosis at this point? These  were tissue samples that were sent in?  Yes. Field diagnoses are, fundamentally, educated guesses. The common  method of thinking is that here we have this acutely fatal disease,  whatever it is. What are the acutely fatal diseases of cattle in Craig  County, Oklahoma? Anthrax, poisonous plants, black leg, blah, blah,  blah. You know a list of some limited number of poisons, and then you  go down your key, looking for this or that, additional data that says,  eventually, it narrows down to the probability that this is anthrax. That   s  how it   s done, but with anthrax, you don   t just guess at the end. You say,     We have to prove this.     At the time, were there different strains of anthrax out there?  No. I mean, I   m sure there were strains out there, but are so-called  anthracoid organisms, organisms that look like anthrax but the mouse  can differentiate the ones that are important and the ones that aren   t.  Today, there are a bunch of different types, and they are distinguishable  one from the other with various, probably, DNA techniques.  Which are all pretty recent.  Yes. DNA didn   t even exist when this anthrax outbreak was going on.  Maybe DNA did, (Laughter) but Watson and Crick  scientists who came  up with the idea of the double helix concept of DNA  hadn   t come along  yet.  Now, when you were doing the lab work here, what sorts of facilities did  you have at the time?  (Laughs) That tickles me because today Uncle Sam and CDC have this  series of laboratories that have different levels of bio-safety involved in  them. The lab that a lot of this work was done in was in the corner of a  room that was the office for the Path ology  Department, and most of the  members of the Path Department. In one corner there was a culture  booth which, basically, was a little tiny room probably four by six or  eight feet with a counter in there, a small incubator, and it wasn   t  ventilated. It wasn   t anything. That   s where it was all done. No fume  hoods, no bio-safety hoods. Nobody died, either.  8  Larson  Panciera  Larson  Panciera  Larson  Panciera  Larson  Panciera  Larson  Panciera  Ewing  Larson  What kind of safety precautions   you mentioned when you were working  as an undergrad, you autoclaved and shrunk your clothes. (Laughter)  Was that the     I mean, the specimens were probably opened carefully and streaked  carefully, and they weren   t thrown in a trash can. They were probably  put in some container that was autoclavable. I   m sure that there were  unnecessary hazards.  But you also were taking great care with what you were doing.  For the times, we were being pretty careful, I suppose.  I was just trying to get a sense of what was considered an appropriate  level of safety at that time.  It was all what the individual decided, how safe he wanted to be,  (Laughter) pretty much. There weren   t any regulations, I can tell you  that. I remember another anthrax case. I   m looking at the room over  there where this case happened. It happened   I got a call from a  veterinarian. I was in Denver at the national veterinary meeting, and I  got a call from a veterinarian in Weatherford who had lost three or four  cows overnight. He wanted to know what was wrong with them, and I  said,    I don   t know, but where are they?    They could   ve had plant  poisoning; they could   ve had anthrax. I suggested he put them on a  truck, haul them up here, and whoever was here would look at them, but  don   t let them take them off the truck until they make a blood smear and  stain it and look for the bug. There was no one here that knew what to  look for, so they unloaded them. It turns out   maybe we could go over  there right now and scrape the floor. (Laughter) It hasn   t been sixty  years since; it could be there.  I must say that we are in McElroy  Hall . What year would that have  been, that outbreak in Weatherford?  I would say it was  thirty-plus  years ago.  Was Oklahoma A M doing a lot of the diagnostic work for the state at  the time?  Yes. We were the state diagnostic lab. That thing had to be before 1975,  which was when the diagnostic lab opened, I think.  It was in the    70s; I don   t know what year. It would be easy to find out.  Was anyone else working on the diagnostic process at this point? I know  9  Panciera  Larson  Panciera  Larson  Panciera  Larson  Panciera  Larson  Panciera  Larson  Panciera  Larson  Panciera  Larson  Panciera  it was summer, so I   m not sure who all was around in 1957.  Paul Barto and Bert Glenn were the two people, I would say, that were  primarily involved after I went to Rhode Island.  Once you had confirmed that anthrax was involved, was there a sort of  reporting protocol to state or federal?  Oh, yes. Oh, yes. State veterinarians, federal veterinarians. They got out  the troops and vaccinated. They tried to vaccinate a perimeter around the  diseased animals and dispose of the dead ones. I think they burned a lot  of tires to incinerate the cadavers.  To get the fires hot enough to     Yes, yes. And I   m sure they dug a lot of holes, too. Deep holes.  I understand that there   s a difference, an important difference, between  the vegetative bacterial state for anthrax and once it goes to spore form.  Right.  Do you want to talk about that?  The vegetative forms are relatively easily killed. They are mostly  destroyed in a decomposing cadaver. However, when exposed to air,  they tend to sporulate, and they are long-lived. They contaminate the  soil, water, whatever. There are protocols for looking or for getting  specimens, to confirm or deny anthrax diagnosis. One of the  overwhelming principles is to not drip too much, don   t expose the inside  of the animal to air and so forth.  So, as long as you can keep it as a relatively closed system     Yes. The number of bugs that survive are much smaller.  So, if you could, basically, bury an intact carcass, you wouldn   t have as  much sporulation?  Right. However, it depends on how far away the hole is. If you have to  drag, that   s an issue.  I grew up on a farm, too. If you had a large dead animal     Where in New York State?  10  Larson  Panciera  Larson  Panciera  Larson  Panciera  Larson  Panciera  Larson  Panciera  Larson  Panciera  Larson  Well, it   s right on the border of Pennsylvania and New York State.  Elmira?  No, over towards Ripley, New York and northeast Pennsylvania. Right  on the very far western edge.  Okay. Jamestown?  Yes, that neck of the woods.  Yes, all right. You can continue now. (Laughter)  What was the next step, after clear identification or confirmation of     I think, again, this vaccination process, just monitoring, trying to keep a  perimeter, and also a quarantine. That   s it. That   s it, as far as I know.  You talked about the fact that it could be a couple of days between when  an animal contracted the disease and when they actually died. I realize  you   re a pathologist, but was there anything that could be done for  animals that were showing symptoms?  Yes. I don   t know how successfully, but at that time the antimicrobials  that were available were basically penicillin and sulfonamides, sulfa  drugs. I think the bacillus was pretty susceptible to penicillin. I would  also think you   d have to treat quite early. Today, if two animals died in a  herd of fifty cows, they   d probably treat the remaining forty-eight  whether they were sick or not, because products of infection can kind of  reach forward and, even though you   ve killed a bunch of the bugs that  are producing this stuff, it remains toxic. So, you have to get there early.  I understand that there had been an outbreak in the general area a few  years earlier. Was there a reason at the time that vaccinations weren   t  more common, or was it an issue of cost or side effects or     Probably. I don   t know. The real answer is I don   t know. But the  occurrence of the disease was not frequent enough, I think, to warrant  vaccination of a population in a county. That process is practiced in  areas where the disease is highly endemic. Probably the Mississippi  Delta country, the Mississippi Valley, but not generally.  From newspaper reports at the time, it sounds like there were other  diseases that were affecting livestock, both before and after. I think there  was vesicular stomatitis and leptospirosis. Do those usually tend to be  paired together, or was it just a coincidence?  11  Panciera  Larson  Panciera  Larson  Panciera  Larson  Panciera  Larson  Panciera  Ewing  Panciera  Larson  Panciera  Vesicular stomatitis should be absolutely nonconfusable with anthrax.  I   m not sure it ever killed anybody, for instance. There was leptospirosis  around in those days, controlled now by vaccination, pretty routinely. It  could be confused, but, from a pathologist   s point of view, there are  significant differences in what one would anticipate in a living or dead  animal.  I guess I was just wondering if those diseases being in the area could   ve  negatively impacted the other animals    immune systems.  No.  But it wouldn   t have made a difference with anthrax?  No.  Which animals were affected by the    57 outbreak? Are you aware of     No. I don   t think that any class of domestic bovine has any more  resistance than any other class.  I guess I was wondering if it had affected swine or sheep or the tissue  sample you had gotten, it just couldn   t happen.  Swine tend to be a bit more resistant than ruminants. Sheep are highly  susceptible. Cattle, horses are highly susceptible. Swine are fairly  resistant. People are fairly resistant. Not resistant enough, but fairly. I  don   t remember swine or sheep being involved in that outbreak,  although animal agriculture back then tended to be a lot more mixed.  People had a few cows and maybe some sheep and chickens and so  forth. I think chickens are, if I recall, very resistant to the organism.  I think vaccination was born in swine, because one of the photographs in  the Life magazine shows Dr.  Bert  Briscoe chasing swine with the  vaccine.  Yes, yes. They   re certainly susceptible, but they tend to suffer somewhat  more localized infections than these other guys.  You were talking before about what sorts of conditions might lead to an  outbreak. So, drought and flooding, or just drought, or any  combination?  It seems to me that one of the issues was that these farm ponds during  drought would recede, and spores might vegetate and produce a lot of  vegetative forms. I know that organic matter in the water or on the creek  12  Larson  Panciera  Larson  Panciera  Larson  Panciera  Larson  Panciera  Larson  Panciera  Larson  Panciera  bank is favorable to the proliferation of the organism. That   s a  mechanism of getting, sort of, the concentration of infectious agents up  to a level of that that would constitute an infective dose for a cow.  I understand with flooding, sometimes, after a drought you can get  spores in the water or have them in the vegetative     Vegetative forms in the water. Now, we   re talking   Bacillus anthracis  exists, as far as I know, as a spore or vegetative form. The vegetation we  were talking about, however, is plant life that provides a nutrient  medium for the vegetative forms of the bug.  I   m trying to get a sense of whether they knew whether the cattle  would   ve been an inhalation thing, or whether they got it through their  food or their water, or if it   s really a moot point.  A lot of this stuff was worked out after 1957. But people in the USDA  studied numerous outbreaks, and that   s how they came up with the effect  of, for instance, alkaline soil, the drop in pond level and all that stuff.  They also noticed that bulls had a lot of cutaneous lesions, cutaneous  anthrax, that might become systemic in them and kill them.  The USDA   thought that that happened because of bulls    habit of kicking dust up and  contaminating fly bites. I don   t know how well-established that  hypothesis is, but I know that it is an operating hypothesis.  So, it   s not seen in the cows. It   s just more of a bull     You prepared for this interview too damn well. (Laughter)  Sorry. (Laughter) I   m just asking     No, no, it   s good. It   s good, but you   re asking me questions that   I  haven   t thought about anthrax, at least, for probably eleven or twelve  years. So, I   m not totally up to speed on things.  That   s okay. You   re more up to speed than any of us are. (Laughs)  I   m surprised how fast you   re going. I think you   re doing well.  I like epidemics. Is there anything about the 1957 outbreak that was  particularly unusual?  I don   t think so. It involved more animals than other outbreaks that had  occurred in Oklahoma that I   m aware of  and  that have occurred since  then. I don   t think it was in any other way out of the ordinary. I   m  thinking about Dr.  Lester  Johnson   s contribution. I   m not going to say  13  Larson  Panciera  Larson  Panciera  Ewing  Panciera  Larson  Ewing  Panciera  Larson  Panciera  Larson  Panciera  anything about that. It fundamentally had to do with, sort of, dealing  with the emergency, getting people that had an idea of what they were  doing on the scene, and it involved a lot of the faculty at the vet school.  And he   s going to tell you about that, I hope.  That   s what we   re hoping, too. When you got back from Rhode Island,  were you involved with any of the aftermath or anything of that?  No, not that I recall. I think things were pretty much over with.  From what you understand, and I realize at this point this would   ve been  somewhat second-hand but, which groups had come in to deal with the  outbreak?  I   m sure the state veterinary forces, which back then might not have  included too many people, and the feds. The USDA.  To Ewing:  Who  were they then? The Bureau of Animal Industry?  Yes, I think it was 1957 that the Bureau of Animal Industry got shut  down, and they shipped it over to the Agricultural Research Service and  AFIS  Agribusiness and Farm Insurance Specialist .  And, like I said, I think people from the vet school faculty went up there  and helped.  We   ve got some of them scheduled.  We know Briscoe was a federal employee, and probably Dr. Arnold, as  well.  I came across his name today. It didn   t have to do with anthrax; I   ll tell  you later.  Is there anything else that we haven   t talked about with the    57 anthrax  outbreak that you   d like to address, or anything with further anthrax  outbreaks later on that you   d like to talk about?  Well, to quote a quote that I kept in my desk for many years,    Professors  of medicine are anxious to tell you all they know and sometimes even  more.    (Laughter) In other words, I hope most of what I told you is the  truth. None of it made up.  Well, thank you so much for helping out with this. We really appreciate  it.  I like it. I think it is good history.  14  Larson  Panciera  Larson  Trying to get what we can while we can.  Well, you better hurry. (Laughter)  Thank you very much.  -------  -------
