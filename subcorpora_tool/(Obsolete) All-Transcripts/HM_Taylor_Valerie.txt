Story_ID: 23313
Speaker 1: I'm going to ask about your family history.  I'm going to ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's side.  And we'll start with your mother's side first so we don't get them mixed up.  So, can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: My mother's name is Ollie Mae Thompson Taylor.  And that's spelled O-L-L-I-E, Mae is M-A-E, Thompson, T-H-O-M-P-S-O-N, Taylor, T-A-Y-L-O-R.
Speaker 1: And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Her date of birth is September 14, 1937, and her place of birth is Tallahassee, Florida.
Speaker 1: Now, what do you know about your mother's side of the family?  How far back can you trace them, and what were they doing?
Speaker 2: So, with my mother's side of the family, I got to know my grandmother.  And I know very well my uncles and aunts, or her sisters and brothers.
Speaker 1: What's your grandmother's name?
Speaker 2: So, her name was Mary Thompson.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I know of my grandfather.  I've never met my grandfather on my mother's side.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What was his name?
Speaker 2: His name is Major Thompson.
Speaker 1: Now, is there a story behind his name Major, at all, that you know of?
Speaker 2: I don't know of a story behind his name being Major Thompson.  I know of the story behind my uncle's name, who was named after my grandfather, being Major Thompson, Jr., and so they always called him Junebug.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: And it took me a little while to realize that Junebug was due to the junior.
Speaker 1: Okay, alright.  Now, what do you remember about your grandparents?
Speaker 2: So, my grandmother lived in Tallahassee, Florida, and sometimes we would go visit my grandmother over the summer.  And so, my grandmother was always very positive and she was a bit overweight.  But whenever we would leave Tallahassee, she would call us and say, "Oh, I am now skinny.  You have to come back and see me.  I lost all the weight."  And we would get so excited, "Granny is skinny, she's lost her weight, let's go back and see it."  So, she was just always positive and encouraging of us.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That's an interesting story.  So, she would use that as a--
Speaker 2: (laughter).  Yeah, she would.  Because we would always say, "Granny, watch your weight for your health."  Because my mother was always concerned about health, because she said heart attacks ran in her family.  And so she was always concerned about her mother in terms of her weight.  And so that's when she would call us back and say she lost the weight, so come back and see it.  And then we would be so excited, "We have to go now."  And then when we would go, we would go, "Granny, what about the weight" when we would see her in person.  And she would say, "Oh, after you all didn't come, I just gained the weight again, sorry about that."  And we would go, "But Granny," (laughter) "You have to eat, okay.  Eat well."
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you didn't know your grandfather.  He passed away before you were born?
Speaker 2: No, he, my grandparents on my mother's side, they were divorced or separated.  I'm not certain if it was an official divorce.  So, they were separated.  And they separated before my parents were married.  And, but my mother remained close to my grandmother.  And so, we got to know my grandmother very well, and the family on my grandmother's side.  So, my mother's cousins on her mother's side and great uncles and great aunts on my mother's side, but we really didn't get to know my grandfather's side.
Speaker 1: Did you ever meet him?
Speaker 2: No, so I never met him.  And he passed away.  It was after my grandmother.  And so, my mother went to the funeral, but we didn't.  As children we didn't go to the funeral.  We went to my grandmother's funeral.
Speaker 1: Now, this is interesting, because in this interview today, I'm in a unique situation of having interviewed your mother the day before, I mean yesterday.
Speaker 2: Uh huh.
Speaker 1: I know she was very close to her father.  And she, when she talked about graduating from high school, I think it was right after they split up, and she talked about her last couple of years in high school and being kind of, she had never thought about it as being traumatic, but when she looked back at it, she said it was a painful time.  And I was surprised that, you know, that her father you know, did not see you all, or talk to you or interact.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Because she was very close with her father.
Speaker 2: She was, because she was the first-born.  So, my mother was the first-born and she was also the only girl.  And so when my mother talks about her childhood, you hear a lot about her father.  Her father was very protective of my mother and also very encouraging of my mother.  And he did not allow anyone to mistreat my mother.  You can tell.  But when my grandparents split, that's when I think the communication with her father may have decreased.  And so by the time when we were born as children, we didn't get to know my grandfather.  We only got to know my grandmother.
Speaker 1: Now, did she ever talk about, you know, the living arrangements after her parents split up, with you?  Because she told us, but I wonder if you could tell us.
Speaker 2: Yes.  She was saying after they split, she went to live with her aunt in New York, who was our Aunt Josephine.  And so, that's on my mother's side, on my grandmother's side.  And so, it was when she was in New York with her Aunt Josephine that she met my father.
Speaker 1: Now, this is true, but she actually lived with someone else in Tallahassee in high school.  Did you know that?
Speaker 2: Well, it may have been Mrs. Nelson.
Speaker 1: Because that was her teacher, yeah.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Yeah, so, I was just wondering if she didn't live with either one of them after they split up.
Speaker 2: Right.  It was very traumatic, I think, when they split up, when her parents split up.  It was very traumatic on my mother.  So, she, she talks about it.  It's very interesting.  My mother talks about her childhood, and you hear her father a great deal.  Then after the split, she only talks about my grandmother.  And so we only heard a lot about my grandmother, but when it comes to protecting her, she would always say, "You know, my father told people, don't mess with Ollie Mae."  And so that part is very interesting.  But, yes--
Speaker 1: Yeah, this is an interesting dynamic.
Speaker 2: Yes, so, we never met.  As children we never met my grandfather.  We have pictures of him but we never met him.
Speaker 1: Because he didn't live too far away, did he, from...
Speaker 2: No, when they split?
Speaker 1: From Tallahassee, yeah.
Speaker 2: No.  And so we, and over time, we've slowly got to know some of the family on my father's side.  And it's very interesting in my mother's family, because even with my grandmother and grandfather, some of--like my grandmother's brother married my grandfather's cousin.  So, you have multiple relationships there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Uh huh.
Speaker 1: Relatives that are related to other relatives?
Speaker 2: Right.  So it's not in the same family, but the two families, I guess relatives in two different families, married multiple times.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um huh, yeah.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: So, you'd be related to your cousin in multiple ways.
Story_ID: 23314
Speaker 1: Now, are there any stories that come down from your mother's [Ollie Mae Thompson Taylor] side of the family about, you know, that go all the way back to the slavery days or the end of, I mean the Emancipation, or any of those kinds of stories?
Speaker 2: So, the stories on my mother's side don't really go back to slavery, because um, well, to a certain extent.  Because on my grandmother's side, I guess my mother's grandmother was also Indian.  And so, that's as far back as we've gone.  So, it was my mother's--I guess my great-grandmother was part Indian, and I think that's where it goes back to slavery, but we never heard much in terms of the stories of what happened that led them to freedom.  So, that part is missing.  But we do know--so, for example, on my mother's mother's side we do know a little more about her side, especially, like she will talk about her grandmother because of being around different family members.
Speaker 1: Now your mother told us about celebrating May the 20th as Emancipation Day in Tallahassee.
Speaker 2: (laughter).
Speaker 1: Now, this was after she said this.  There was nothing ever discussed about slavery, like you just told us.
Speaker 2: (laughter).
Speaker 1: And then she told us, "Wait a minute, they celebrated May 20 as Emancipation Day."
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Do you remember that, or--
Speaker 2: Do we celebrate?  We--
Speaker 1: Do you remember hearing about that when you were growing up, or?
Speaker 2: So, I remember my mother talking about Emancipation Day, because in Chicago [Illinois] it was Juneteenth.  And so, and that's when my mother would say "In Tallahassee, it was in May."  And she would laugh, you know, "Up north, you know, you all have a different day than June."  So, we would hear differences about what's going on in the north versus the south.  And it's very interesting growing up in Chicago, because we would drive back to Tallahassee when we were young.  It wasn't where we flew, we would drive.  And this was in the '60's [1960s], so you still had segregation, and I remember, you know, stopping at gas stations and wondering if we could use the bathroom or not.  And that only occurred when we got to certain states.  In Chicago when I was young, we could use the bathroom.  But as we got further south, they talked to us, because it was only certain bathrooms you could use, and the behavior of the south.  So, we got to know the south versus the north.  And also the friendliness of the south versus the north.  And so, for example, we would go visit my uncle, and one time a friend of his wasn't home.  And he said "Come on in, you know, they leave the door open, so you can come on in."  And my sister and brother and I, we all stood outside.  We were saying "Uncle, we don't go in people's houses unless they unlock the door and let us in."  (laughter).  He was like, "Naw, down south, you come right on in."  And he kept saying come on in.  And it took us a little while before we would go in.  And when we got in, when the person came home, he was saying, "Why didn't y'all get some pie?"  And we were going, "We're not supposed to be here, because unless the person unlocks the door, we're not supposed to go in."  And it was just hilarious.  The next thing they're laughing saying, "Oh, that's because they're from the north.  See, in the north they all lock the doors, and you know, everybody's not friendly, but in the south, we're friendly."  I mean, now, times have changed, where I think because of crime and killing and murders, everyone everywhere, you lock your doors.  But when we were young, down south, people didn't lock the doors.  You'd go by a person's house, you ate food--and my mother, when we were growing up she always told us, don't eat over other people's homes, because she didn't want people to think we were home starving.  So, she said "Do not eat over anyone else's house but your own house."  So unless my mother gave us approval, we did not eat over other people's homes.  And so we got to know the north versus the south.
Story_ID: 23315
Speaker 1: Okay, alright.  Now, your mother was raised all the way in Tallahassee and finished high school there.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Alright.  Did, what did your mother say about being raised in Tallahassee?  Did she have any stories?
Speaker 2: Oh, she had some stories and, she, you know, she talked about the jobs that people could have, that at that time when she was growing up, most blacks were in education, were school teachers, because that's the only good job they could have was a school teacher or to work in the post office.  And so, many of my great aunts are school teachers, or in education, or principals in that aspect.  She talked about the importance of education.  She talked about growing up in a segregated environment, of also the other job you could have was being a maid.  And so, for a time I think when she was in high school, she cleaned houses.  So, we all know how to clean a house very well.  And she, you know, actually impressed upon us the importance of education, because so many of our relatives were school teachers, or still are school teachers.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I know she said her father really pushed the idea of education.  Did, now, did she share with you what she wanted to be when she was growing up?
Speaker 2: She did at one point.  Because it's very interesting.  My mother played basketball, you know.  And so she was on the basketball team, which we found very fascinating.  Because growing up, my brother--is it okay if I talk about him now?
Speaker 1: Sure.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So, my brother had sickle cell anemia, which means he has an enlarged spleen.  So he could never play contact sports.  And as a result--and he's the oldest, so I think because he could not play contact sports, it's never where sports were considered a big item in my family.  And so it was very interesting as we got older, to learn that my mother played basketball and was a big advocate of sports.  And I think it was something we didn't discuss very much because my brother did have sickle cell.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Yeah, she, yeah, she said that basketball was cut out though, when she was in high school, because of--
Speaker 2: The cut in funds, uh huh.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Right, but she played on the basketball team, and she was saying she was really good.
Speaker 1: Yeah, she told us--
Speaker 2: (laughter).
Speaker 1: But they're quite a few people we've interviewed who were in the south who grew up in the '30's [1930s] and '40's [1940s] that talk about playing basketball, you know, I mean women that were on basketball teams that were competitive teams--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Tennessee and Georgia, and I've interviewed a few people that played.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And, you know, that's an era where you don't think of women's sports as being big.
Speaker 2: Right, you don't, uh huh.  Yes, and I guess because, probably because my brother didn't play sports, then it's not where it was a big item in the house.  But he was--he was very interested in sports, so he made the manager on the sports team when he was in high school, but it was recognized because of his spleen that he could not play the sports.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, I'm asking these questions even though I know the answers.  Did your mother finish school? (laughter).
Speaker 2: (laughter).  Yeah.  So, my mother, she finished high school and she also went to junior college.  And this was after having children.  And then she went on to finish her bachelor's degree in early childhood education, and she finished her master's degree in early childhood education.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And she's currently retired from Chicago Public Schools, right?
Speaker 2: Right.  So, and she's currently retired from the Chicago Public School system.
Story_ID: 23316
Speaker 1: I'm going to go to your father's side of the family, and then we'll get them together.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: My father's full name is Willie James Taylor, W-I-L-L-I-E, James, J-A-M-E-S, Taylor, T-A-Y-L-O-R.  And he currently lives in College Station, Texas.  And he was born in Jackson, Mississippi.
Speaker 1: Jackson?  Okay.  That's different from what he said yesterday.
Speaker 2: Oh, where was he born?  (laughter).
Speaker 1: Uh--
Speaker 2: Let me see, he gave me this--
Speaker 1: Centerville, I think.
Speaker 2: Oh, that's right.  It is Centerville, outside of Jackson.  Should I change, can I change that?
Speaker 1: Yes, I mean, yeah, we're just, we've got it.  It's on the record, because all this goes into the archives, you know, everything we're talking about.
Speaker 2: Okay. (laughter).
Speaker 1: So, Centerville, Mississippi, yeah.
Speaker 2: Right.  So--
Speaker 1: That's--
Speaker 2: And I'll start over.  So, my father is Willie James Taylor, W-I-L-L-I-E...
Speaker 1: And what is his date of birth and place of birth?  You already spelled it, so, I'm sorry--yeah, what's his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: My father's date of birth is September 2, 1932, and his place of birth is Centerville, Mississippi.
Speaker 1: Now, this is near Macomb, which is further south than Jackson.  It's actually, you know, near Macomb, Mississippi.
Speaker 2: Right, but I think the airport is Jackson where you--
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, well, what do you know about your father's side of the family?  How far back can you trace them and what were they doing?
Speaker 2: So, my father's side of the family is very interesting.  My father's parents died before we were born.  So, I think my father's father died when he was about eleven, and his mother died when he was about eighteen, and my father is the oldest of three children.  And he was adopted by his uncle, Uncle Alec, and his wife Angeline.  So, Alec and Angeline Chapman adopted my father and his brother and sister so they could be together after his mother died.  And so, with my father's side, we have family reunions every two years.  And as a result of the family reunion, then we've gone back to trace more of the family history.  And so, we've gone back to trace even back to those who were slaves.  And it's where stories have been told.  You only know about certain names in the family.  So, on my father's side, for example, his grandparents were Elisa and Jacob Chapman.  And they had nineteen children.  So, my father's side, people had a large number of children.   I think my father having only three children is considered fairly small, because even his aunt had eight children.  So, we've gone back to trace some of the--well, we know all the children with Jacob and Elisa, and unfortunately all of them are now are deceased.   But we did get to know many of my great aunts and uncles on my father's side, because they lived in Chicago [Illinois].  So, it gave us a chance to get to know his family.  With my mother's family, in contrast, only her cousin lived in Chicago.  So, we got to know my mother's cousin who is Ann Bradley, we got to know her very well.  But on my father's side, because many of his uncles and aunts lived in Chicago, we got to know a great many cousins on my father's side in Chicago.
Speaker 1: Of the nineteen, how many were in Chicago, do you think?
Speaker 2: Of the nineteen, let me see, because I got to know Alec, Jacob, and also Cissy and it was another aunt.  Her name escapes me right now, it'll come to me.  But I would say of the nineteen, probably maybe ten, at least ten, lived in Chicago.  There may have been more.  So, they lived in Chicago or Mississippi.
Speaker 1: Okay.  It was a strong connection between Mississippi and Chicago.
Speaker 2: (laughter).  Yes.
Speaker 1: I married into a Mississippi family myself, so I know that there's lot of children all over the--the family it was big, you know, at the grandparent level anyway, we have like lots of people.
Speaker 2: Right.  So, you had cousins everywhere.  And your cousins were your babysitters.  And so, it just made it always around family, which made it a lot of fun.
Story_ID: 23317
Speaker 1: What did your father say about growing up?
Speaker 2: So, my father is very interesting.  Because we got to know my Uncle Alec as our grandfather, okay.  And it wasn't until I think I was in high school that I introduced Uncle Alec as my grandfather.  Someone asked the question, why do you call him Uncle Alec and not Grandpa?  And then it dawned on me, I had gone so long saying Uncle Alec that it just became the name, Uncle Alec, that you forget, oh no, this is my uncle.  And so, you know, I knew it was because my parents died, but I just never called my Uncle Alec Grandpa, but I would introduce him as my grandfather.
Speaker 1: It's interesting.  I think he played the role of grandfather, even though he was really an uncle.
Speaker 2: Right.  He did.  So, and my father, he talked about his mother and his father in spurts, okay.  Because I, we all realized that that was very hard on him.  And so he would talk about his parents in spurts.  He would talk about his family in general, but I think he was very close to his mother, because his father died when he was eleven.  And so we know, like for example, on my father's side, a major health issue was tuberculosis, because my father's father died of tuberculosis and my father's youngest brother had tuberculosis, and my sister had a trace of tuberculosis when we were growing up.  And so, at one point they didn't know how to treat tuberculosis.  They would just put you in the hospital and in an area of containment. But that's all, that's how they treated you.
Speaker 1: It was called a sanatorium.
Speaker 2: Right, the sanatorium.  And for my sister, when she was high school, she had, she tested positive for tuberculosis, but then they treated her as an outpatient.  So, you really had a chance to know firsthand the advancements that were made with tuberculosis.  It was a vast difference of how my uncle was treated for his tuberculosis versus my sister with her treatment of tuberculosis.
Speaker 1: There's an interesting issue that just popped up in my head, because your father said that his mother worked in a sanatorium, a tuberculosis sanatorium.  Now she's working there, but some of your relatives on that side have tuberculosis.  And I don't know whether there's a connection or what, but did you know that, that your--?
Speaker 2: That my grandmother worked in a--, right.  And so we all assumed that when you worked there, you took extra precautions because of being around patients with tuberculosis, and because of not really understanding the true impact of tuberculosis and how to treat it, they were very overly cautious in terms of with my grandmother.  But my grandmother on my father's side had cancer.  So, she died of cancer.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so my father is very sensitive about being tested for cancer.  So, he checks with my sister and myself, about making certain we have our exams every year to be tested in multiple ways with cancer.  And so he's very involved with health.
Story_ID: 23318
Speaker 1: But, so, did your father [Willie James Taylor] talk about what his aspiration was in his youth?  Did he have a goal in mind of what we wanted to be, or--
Speaker 2: Of what my father wanted to be?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Well, it's very interesting because with my father, his father was an engineer.  And well, I think it's--what's it?  He did a lot of repairs, and so we considered that an engineer.  And my father is an engineer.  He's very good in math, so his degree is actually in mathematics, but his practice, his minor was in electronics.  And so, his practice was in engineering.  And so, for us, with my father and starting a company, you know, I guess--when I was young, he started a company in 1967. So, I was only four years old.  And we would always go around the company, Sonicraft.  So, for my father, in looking at him start a company and run a business as well as be active in our education, we always I think just assumed his aspirations were to be an engineer and have a company.  But I think it's when you talk to him, he'll say you know, it's to actually follow your passion, you know.  Know what makes you happy and pursue what makes you happy.
Speaker 1: I think, now, he was, he was telling us he was a musician in high school.
Speaker 2: Was he?
Speaker 1: A gifted musician.
Speaker 2: (laughter).
Speaker 1: And thought about seriously pursuing music.
Speaker 2: Really?
Speaker 1: And was told he should choose between engineering and music.
Speaker 2: It's very--it--oh, you know what?  He did play piano.  And he, he mentioned that, but he doesn't talk about it much.  So, he mentioned piano and I think with my brother, they tried to get him to play piano.  When we were young, it was where we didn't have the money necessarily to go into, to go into depth in music, but he really enjoys now the fact that his grandchildren are into music.  So, my son, he started off playing the clarinet and has now moved to the guitar.  And my daughter is doing well with the piano.  And so, but he doesn't really talk about the piano much.
Speaker 1: So, we talked, well, you know, he grew up in the same building with Dr. Harold Pates.  And--
Speaker 2: Uh huh.
Speaker 1: Pates was a saxophonist.  He had his own jazz group when he was in high school, and your father played the piano, you know, and was a well-known piano player.  But you know, that's, that's funny how that, you know, he doesn't really talk about it.
Speaker 2: No, he doesn't.  And his brother--actually I think they had a group with Herbie Hancock at one time.  So, because his brother sang in the choir a great deal, and I think my father sang in the choir.  But now my father doesn't go anywhere close to the choir (laughter).  And my Uncle Alec sang in the choir.
Speaker 1: Yeah, they were part of, he said his father, I guess your grandfather, was part of a singing group in Chicago at Progressive Baptist Church.
Speaker 2: Right, yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Progressive Baptist, right, right.
Story_ID: 23319
Speaker 1: So, I know he went to the service.  I think coming back from the service is where he met your mother [Ollie Mae Thompson Taylor], right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: In New York.
Speaker 2: Right.  Because he--
Speaker 1: Well, what did they--now they both told their version of the story of how they--
Speaker 2: (laughter).  It's very interesting how they met.  It's like an ideal love story, I think, because he--the story as I know it is that he was in the same troop, I think, as my mother's cousin.  And I think his name may have been Roger.  And so, Roger brought my father [Willie James Taylor] home one time on a trip, on a leave, and that's where he met my mother.  And they may have spent like two weeks together in New York and then corresponded a great deal, and maybe saw each other again.  But then my father knew that he wanted to marry my mother, and sent her an engagement ring in a box of Kleenex (laughter), and which that's the engineer in him, assuming that nobody would guess that an engagement ring would be in a box shaped like a box of Kleenex, but not realizing the impact of a box of Kleenex. And my mother receiving a box of Kleenex thinking that oh, he's just trying to say, you know, I'm gone, and gave her a box of Kleenex for crying, until she got down to the ring, and saw the ring.  So, they're hilarious.  (laughter).
Speaker 1: Now, neither one of them told the story about the Kleenex.
Speaker 2: Oh, didn't they, really?  (laughter).
Speaker 1: And they both had a different perception of how long it took.  Your father seemed to think they were together a long time before they got married, and your mother said it happened real quick, you know, they met and then they were married you know, within a year.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Which she agrees, but to him it was a longer time than--
Speaker 2: Right.  And see, I think he had a girlfriend in Chicago or something.  And so, I think his family liked the girlfriend, but they didn't know my mom.  So, then you have my mom coming from New York and getting married.  So, they got married at Uncle Alec's house, in a small wedding.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Uh huh.
Speaker 1: Uncle Alec who served as grandfather?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Uh huh.  And Uncle Alec loved my mother, because he would come over and help her.  When we moved to a house, he would come over and help her with the garden every year.  He loved my mother.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 23320
Speaker 1: So, now, when you consider your parents' personalities and their dispositions, their habits, their hobbies, the way they walk and talk, who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: I think both, actually.  Because they complement each other.  They're very different, but they're very secure in their differences.  And so, together they're phenomenal.  And that is, like my father [Willie James Taylor] is a low-key type of person who is a deep thinker.  Now my mother [Ollie Mae Thompson Taylor] is a thinker, but she's also very vocal, and she will tell you what she thinks regardless of what you may think about what she said.  She will tell you what's on her mind and speak her mind.  My father is a little more reserved.  And I think I take after a combination of both, and that is, sometimes I have to look at a situation and I'll go okay, this is a business situation, what do I think my father would do?  And then I'll go, but I really want to say this.  And I know my mother would just be vocal.  So, then you come up with a compromise and say I'm going to say it in a diplomatic way and get it out there.  So, I think it's a combination of both, and that is, I do speak my mind, but I try to say it in a diplomatic way.
Speaker 1: Okay, well that's a pretty good balance.
Speaker 2: I think so.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Story_ID: 23321
Speaker 1: Now, now, you've got a brother and a sister.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And, you're the youngest.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Right.  Well, tell us about your brother and your sister.
Speaker 2: So, we all had important roles in the family, okay.  And my mother [Ollie Mae Thompson Taylor] made certain to tell us that.  My brother is the first born and the only boy.  So, my mother would always say, "Oh, he's my favorite son," okay.  We'd kind of go "He's your only son."  "But that doesn't matter, he's my favorite son."  Okay, my sister is the first girl, and so my mother often called her First Girl, okay.   And that was my sister's role.  And she would go, "Oh, you're my favorite first girl."  (laughter).  "She's your only first girl, Mom."  And then I was Baby Girl.  And she'd say "Oh, you're my favorite baby girl.  And I'd go, "I'm your only."  And she'd go, "but you're my favorite."  So we all had roles.  And my mother would always tell us, "You all have very different roles, and you all are very different people, but I love you with all my heart, so never doubt that.  But you all have different needs."  And so, that's how we grew up.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So, the household, when you were growing up, is your mother and your father [Willie James Taylor], your brother and your sister.  Did any of your cousins or uncles or aunts live with you when you were growing up?
Speaker 2: So, my Aunt Ann, when she first moved to Chicago--because my mother wanted a relative of hers in Chicago, and so Ann came up with her.  And Ann is very interesting, because Ann's mother is my grandfather's cousin and Ann's father was my grandmother's brother, okay.  And so, Ann came up and Ann stayed with us for a while until Ann got married.  So, we grew up knowing Ann all of our lives, and also my father's brother and sister.  So, his brother is Lewis Taylor, Jr.  So, again, he was called Junebug.  So you begin to know everybody that was a junior was Junebug. (laughter).  But we also called him Bug because they said his ears were like Bugs Bunny.  So we always knew him as Bug (laughter).  And his sister is Theresa.  So we, we knew Bug and Theresa and their families very well, because my father would get together with his sister and brother at least once a week.  So, we got to know my cousins, and in particular, like one cousin, Regina.  She's the same age as my sister.  It would be the three of us.  And growing up, the three of us would mimic the Jackson Five or the Supremes or, you know, any music group, you know.  That would be the three of us.  So, and we're still very close.
Speaker 1: Now, do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: An earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 1: The first thing that you remember.
Speaker 2: (laughter). I have a memory from a picture.  And that is of us, I guess, with our underclothes on.  So, tee shirt and undershirt, and playing on a horse that had springs in it.  And so, I was on the horse, and my mother was there and my sister and brother are right there.  And I think I may have been about two or three on this horse.  And so, I guess that's the earliest memory I have.  But it's from a picture that I've seen, and I just laugh about that.
Story_ID: 23322
Speaker 1: Now, you grew up--what was the neighborhood that you grew up in?
Speaker 2: So, I grew up in 7708 South Lowe, so 77th and Lowe.  So, on the south side of Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 1: Now, that would be, would that be, that's Auburn Gresham they call it, I guess?
Speaker 2: I don't know if it's Auburn Gresham.
Speaker 1: 77th and Lowe.  That would be west on 77th Street, on the west side of the Dan Ryan.
Speaker 2: Right.  On the west side, just past Halsted.  So, about three blocks past, three blocks east of Halsted.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I'm not sure either if that's Auburn Gresham or if that's--
Speaker 2: I'm not certain if that is, either.  I think that's right on the edge, uh huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But, okay, so what was the neighborhood like, and I mean, what was your place like?  Did you live in an apartment or a house?
Speaker 2: We lived in an apartment building.  So, it was in a building.  It was three flats and there were two apartments on each floor.  And so there was also a basement apartment.  And the interesting thing was that everybody knew each other in the apartment building.  And so, you would--like, the lady downstairs was Ethel Cockcroft, and she was close friends with my mom [Ollie Mae Thompson Taylor].  And so, if something happened and my mother was outside washing--because my mother loved to wash.  Well, I won't say loved to wash.  My mother washed a lot, because she always wanted us to have clean clothes, and it's not like we had a lot of clothes, so we washed often.  And so, if my mother was outside and we couldn't find her, we would go see Ethel Cockcroft downstairs.  Or, across the hall, you know, was the Broadways and we could go over there if you needed some sugar or something like that.  And, you know, we knew the people upstairs and the people all the way on the third floor.  You got to know each other such that if there, you know, if something happened or there was a need, you know, you could go between the floors.  And it's very interesting I bring that up, because when my grandfather was ill, and it's not where he could live in a house by himself, my cousin bought a three-flat.  So, they lived on one floor, my grandfather lived on the middle floor, and then my aunt lived on the third floor.  So, again, it became this three-flat building which they still have now.  And with the three-flat building, you go between the floors.  The refrigerator is a common refrigerator.  You know, leftovers may be on the second floor or third floor.  And it's funny how my daughter whenever we go to Chicago, she loves to stay with my aunt with the three-flat.  She always says "When I grow up, I'm going to live in a three-flat or a building where everybody knows each other."  And it's just this common building.  Because now we have a home, and it's not that way, but it's very interesting, that living space in a building, of when you get to know each other in that extended family.  And so, that part I remember very well as a child.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 23323
Speaker 1: What were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: So, I think in terms of some of the sights, it had to do with the apartment building where we grew up, also the alley that was in between the two streets, two parallel streets.  And so, with that alley, it was a group of us, where during the summer who went out into the alley, and that's where you played.  We would play piggy, you know.  You go out and call piggy one, piggy two, piggy three (laughter).  Or, you know, also some of the sounds have to do with people calling cobs.  You know, if you went to the local sweet shop, and bought some candy, you had to quickly say no cobs.  Otherwise it was a rule that if anyone said cobs you had to share it.  But if you call no cobs, you could eat all of it, you know, have it to yourself.  So it was cobs, no cobs.  I called cobs before you called no cobs, sorry.  (laughter).  And I think some of the smells have to do with barbecue, because my parents loved to barbecue.  And so, on the back porch we had this little grill, and my father would be out there grilling hot dogs.  And he always told us, whatever you have, you should share.  Never be so selfish that you want to keep everything to yourself.  So, I remember one time we were barbecuing hot dogs and someone came by the apartment building, like in the backyard, that we didn't know.  And so, they were like oh, that barbecue smells good.  And so my father said "Do you want a hot dog?"  And I was like, "Dad?"  He goes, never ever be so selfish that you cannot share with somebody else.  Uh huh.  So, he just gave like, you know, a stranger--because they said um that smells good.  He goes "Here, here's a hot dog."
Story_ID: 23324
Speaker 1: Now, this is a Mississippi quality about Chicago.
Speaker 2: (laughter).
Speaker 1: You know, a lot of places, and that's, and what you're describing is those carry-overs from rural life.  I mean, I suspect that's what that is.
Speaker 2: Right.  It's the friendliness of the south, of always being giving towards others.  Uh huh.
Speaker 1: And when you describe your family living in close proximity like that, I think that maybe, you know, when we don't have families so close, you know, that kind of stuff breaks down.
Speaker 2: It does, because living in College Station [Texas], I really have come to value that.  And I notice that my kids are lacking that.  So, we travel a great deal back to Chicago and we stay with my aunt and they stay.  I visit-- my sister visits me, so that our kids can get to know each other.  But it's not the same from what we had when my cousin would come by our house on the weekends or we'd go over there and we would see each other every weekend.  So, it's not the same.  So, we feel, like I'm still in contact with some of the alley rats from 77th and Lowe.  And then when I was in seventh grade, that's when we moved to a house.  And that was a big deal, to move to the house, you know, where you had, you know, my brother actually had his own bedroom, because up until that point, we had two bedrooms.  So, my parents had a bedroom, and my sister and I shared a bedroom, and my brother slept on a sofa bed in the dining room.  And so, that was it, and the kitchen and the living room.  And so, when we got to the house, he was able to get his own bedroom and we had a basement.  The washer and dryer now was in the basement, so my mother [Ollie Mae Thompson Taylor] didn't have to go downstairs to the laundry room, which was nice.  But the community was very different.  So, it's not where we had the alley rats.  So, we went up and down the block, and everybody, you know, it wasn't a closeness.  So, I don't even, for example, I don't stay in contact with anyone from when we moved to the house.  My parents stay in contact with their next door neighbor, but it's not where I stay in contact with any of the children that were on the block.  No, but from 77th and Lowe, we do, you know, I have Alicia Davis, we stay in contact with each other.  I have her cell phone.  Whenever I'm in Chicago, we talk and get together.  So, that part I remember very well.
Speaker 1: Do you ever, where did you all live, where was your house?
Speaker 2: Our house was on 82nd place, just west, two blocks west of Damen.  So it was 2153 West 82nd Place.  And across the street was a company, so we didn't have homes across the street.  And we had an empty parking lot across the street from our house.
Speaker 1: What was across the, what company was it?
Speaker 2: It was a chemical company at first, but then became an electronics company called Topco.
Speaker 1: Uh huh.
Speaker 2: And then at the end of the block was a railroad track.  And see, on the other side of the railroad track, that was part of the Dan Ryan Woods.  So, you didn't have a lot of houses over there.  Whereas on 77th and Lowe, you had Lowe, you had Union and you had Emerald.  So, we went to school on Emerald.  So we could walk to school on Emerald and walk home.
Story_ID: 23325
Speaker 1: Because that's where we went to Saint Leo the Great Elementary School.  It was on Emerald.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Saint Leo?
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Um--
Speaker 1: It's now torn down.
Speaker 2: Was it associated with Leo High School?
Speaker 1: So, there's a Leo High School--
Speaker 2: Yeah, on 79th, right?
Speaker 1: Right.  And so, Leo High, they're named after the same saint, Saint Leo the Great.  But it's not whereas kids that went to Saint Leo Elementary definitely went to Leo High.  It wasn't that connection, it was separate.  So, you had to apply to go to Leo High.
Speaker 2: Leo High School was where Bryant Gumbel and his brother went to high school.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: They went there, and there are other people I know that are famous that came out of Leo.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Right there on 79th Street.
Speaker 1: Right, like 79th and Sangamon.
Speaker 2: Uh huh.
Speaker 1: Uh huh.  And so it's an all boys' school.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And so we, my brother went to Hales Franciscan, which is an all boys' school and my sister and I went to Maria High School.
Speaker 2: Now, where did you start in school?  I mean, what was your first elementary school?
Speaker 1: So, my first elementary school was actually Saint Leo.  And that's where I went for kindergarten.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now, are your parents Catholics?
Speaker 1: So, my father is Catholic and my mother [Ollie Mae Thompson Taylor] is now Catholic.  But growing up, it's not where my mother was Catholic.  She became baptized Catholic later on.  But because we went to Saint Leo, we went to the church.  And so they said that's important that we support the school and the church.  And so my father [Willie James Taylor] was very active.  He was head of the school board.  He actually ran the Bingo games that they had on Sunday, and we participated.  He was actually a Cub Scout leader.  So my sister and I, because my father was a Cub Scout leader, my sister and I participated in the Cub Scouts.  We did not participate in Girl Scouts (laughter).  So we would go to the meetings with my father, and as long as he was there we could play in the games.  We couldn't participate in the official Cub Scout activities like the Derby Race or going on the camping trips, but we could participate in the games.  You know, like some of the games where you had like a little banderol in the middle of the floor, and you had two teams on both sides, and you had to try to grab it before the other team, you know, hit you out or something like that.  So, we would play those games.  Then my mother tried to get us involved with the Girl Scouts.  So my sister and I went to one Girl Scout meeting, and we both said, you know they don't play the same games or do the same things, so we said we want to go back to the Cub Scout meetings, we don't want to go to the Girl Scouts. (laughter).  So then we just stayed with the Cub Scouts.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay.
Speaker 1: Uh huh.
Speaker 2: Now, did you have a favorite subject in school?
Speaker 1: So, my favorite subject was math.  And that's because I always felt that English was very subjective and that it depended upon the teacher.  So, one year you would write, I would call the flowery, a lot of adjective type writing.  The next year it was more straight to the point, concise, and I never knew what the teacher wanted.  It always took a while to get used to the teacher. But with math, it's always the same.  Each year, two plus two is four, that never changes.  How you approach the math, it never changes, and for that reason I loved math.  It's very objective, it's not dependent upon my perspective, it's not dependent upon how I'm writing, what I'm drawing, my interpretation.  It was either right or wrong.  So, I enjoyed math.
Speaker 2: You know, a lot of mathematicians say that, too, and physicists.  And you know, they all say that.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: So, now, did you have a favorite teacher in elementary school?
Speaker 1: So, my favorite teacher, I think I had two, okay.  And one was Mrs. Brown, and she was my teacher in first and second grade.  And it was just, she was so positive.  Like, if we did something nice, she would give us a little party in our class.  Now, when we were talkative, we didn't get a party.  But she would always tell us, I want the best from you and you need to understand when you need to talk and when you don't need to talk, but always do your best.  And she would strive and make certain and say if you got a B, was that your best?  That's good, but was it your best?  Did you do your very best?  And I think another teacher who taught me really good study skills was Sister Janet.  So, Sister Janet was my fourth grade teacher.  And we would have what I considered at that time, hard vocabulary words.  And I would say, oh my God, how am I going to learn these vocabulary words?  And so she taught me, she taught all of us the beauty of index cards.  Write things down on index cards, take them with you wherever you go.  So, if you're in the car on the way to the grocery store, you can be studying your vocabulary.  If you're on the bus stop, you can be studying your vocabulary.  And it works, because then when it comes time for the vocabulary test you don't have to do this massive studying.  And she would always say try to incorporate what you've learned into everyday life.  So, I would use my vocabulary words, you know.  I think--and I would use, especially, words to talk about my brother.  I would use (laughter)--
Speaker 2: So, did you have an example of an educated insult that you would--
Speaker 1: (laughter).  I think--what was it?   It was, I think, avarice, and I think it's greedy.  And I was, you know, you're an avaricious, you know, brother.  You just, you know, and so then he would have to look it up, or you  know (laughter)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I like that.
Speaker 1: I didn't do that with my sister, but my brother, yes.
Speaker 2: There's always a more adversarial relationship with brothers, probably than sisters.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Story_ID: 23326
Speaker 1: I mean, what was going on in technology in those days?
Speaker 2: Oh, so I did, because of my father's [Willie James Taylor] company.  And so, uh--
Speaker 1: Now, they started, uh--
Speaker 2: In '67' [1967].
Speaker 1: In '67' [1967], okay.  This is Sonicraft?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And we didn't point out before that your father went to IIT, Illinois Institute of Technology.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And there he and some of his colleagues formed--
Speaker 2: Sonicraft.
Speaker 1: Sonicraft.
Speaker 2: Right.  So, my father went to IIT and initially worked at the Research Institute at IIT, in what was called ITRI, and so he used to travel with ITRI.  But a number of his friends, there were five of them, got together and started a company where they worked on defense contracts: building electronics, designing and building electronic equipment.  And so, in '67' [1967] was when Sonicraft became incorporated.  And I think that's when they had their first government contract.  And so, they were designing anything from, for example, the lights at one time that used to be on the runway to flash for planes to come in.  They designed the lights and actually built them.  They designed some things with the screens, to actually allow some graphics to appear on screens, on displays.  And it was in the context of military most of the time.  So, it's not where they did commercial, it was mostly military.  They did do at one time contract work with--I think it was with Sony, building some of their--I think it was the Allegro speakers.  And so, they built the Allegro speakers for Sony as well.
Story_ID: 23327
Speaker 1: So did you get involved in early programs in technology for youth when you were in grade school, or did it add them later, or--
Speaker 2: Well, I think we were, as children we were exposed to technology through my father's [Willie James Taylor] company.  So, for example when I was young, my mother [Ollie Mae Thompson Taylor], that's when my mother went back to school, first at Kennedy King Community College and then National, in terms of getting her degree.  And so, on Saturdays my father would take us to work with him.  And it's funny, because my sister and I, first we would be at his desk acting like we were secretaries, writing on paper, okay.  But then, you slowly ventured to the electronics bench, okay.  And so, when you mentioned about smell, one smell that comes to mind is that of a soldering iron.  I can tell that smell anywhere because it's something I grew up smelling, you know, going to work with my father on Saturdays.  Because oftentimes he would go in, not to work on paperwork, but to be at the bench building something such that when I was in high school, I was very familiar with schematics.  I was familiar with breadboard.  I could look at a schematic and build a breadboard.  And I just thought that was the norm.  I could work on bikes (laughter).  You were used to having a volt meter around to see if something were connected.  You just knew, go get the volt meter and see if you have a current through. (laughter).  That was our norm, and for example, in our house, my father built our first speaker.  It was nice.  Everybody talked about that.  The sound from the speaker--and he also built our first record player.  So, for a long time our record player had vacuum tubes, okay, where we had to jingle the vacuum tube, and you knew the record player was on because the filament lit up in the vacuum tube, okay.  So, everything was, all the electronics were exposed.  So, you'd jiggle it: "Okay, the record player's on, play the record."  And so, it wasn't until I was high school that we got this record player where everything was enclosed.  And I was like, "Dad, where are the vacuum tubes?" (laughter).  He'd say, "We have transistors now." (laughter).  So, we, I think we grew up with technology, but not knowing it as such, but you just grew up thinking this was the norm.  And he always taught you, he would take time to teach you how to fix something.  Or, he would say, you know, you would say "Oh, this is broken."  And he would go, "Go get the screwdriver."  And you knew what a Phillips versus a flathead was, and "Go get the Phillips, let's take it apart and let's see what's going on."  And it may be something with the wires.  And so, that, that was Dad and that was the norm.  So I think all of us, my sister and brother--currently if something's broken, you go, "Get the Phillips, see what's going on, maybe it can be fixed."  (laughter).  You know, that's your first thought.  I think now it's funny because my mother is like "Can't you call a repairman because you know it takes a little while for your father to get to stuff.  Go ahead and call."  (laughter).  But, he'll fix anything first.  Uh huh.
Speaker 1: That sounds like an engineer.
Speaker 2: Yes, so we did grow up with technology.
Speaker 1: Now, Sonicraft was the first black technology company to, you know, bring down big government contracts.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: They're well known.  I mean, people heard the name.  I didn't know your father, but I heard of the name Sonicraft.  There's some people, you know, doing this deep technology for the government.  And I said wow.  Then I met Carl Spite at one point.
Speaker 2: Oh yes, uh huh.
Speaker 1: He was working with Sonicraft.  So, it was exciting to a lot of people just to think that we had a company that could do that, because a lot of black people didn't imagine that we had anyone in deep technology.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And so, it was a thrill and, you know, for us to even think about that. (laughter).
Speaker 2: It was.  And, but my mother, my mother kept it real, okay.  So, and it was interesting, because my father, when George Bush 41 was vice-president under [President Ronald] Reagan, my father went to the White House because of the contract they received from the government.  So, we have a picture of him with at that time vice-president Bush.
Speaker 1: Right, right.  I saw it yesterday actually standing in front of the White House.
Speaker 2: Yes.  So, it's--
Speaker 1: The Sonicraft staff--
Speaker 2: Right.  So, it's really phenomenal.  And they hired engineers from MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology], and it was great, the work that was being done there.  So, my father, all of us grew up with Sonicraft.  So, my brother, my sister, myself, we all worked at Sonicraft, and our friends.  Because my mother's view is if she came home from work during the summer and we were sitting around the house, we had to get a job.  Because my mother said, "I'm not coming home to people lounging."  And if we had friends over, they had to get a job.  So they knew if they came by the house, they had to get a job.  (laughter).  And she would always tell my father, "Please get the kids a job.  So, that way, they'd come home at five, having worked a day."  So, when you were eligible to work at sixteen, we were working at Sonicraft.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: Uh huh.  And even after my brother graduated with his degree, he worked at Sonicraft.  My sister, after she finished with her degree in information systems, she worked at Sonicraft for some time.  Her husband, at that time they were just dating, he worked at Sonicraft during the summer as a summer intern while he was in college.  So, everybody in our circle, you know, at one summer or another you went through Sonicraft.  And it was, it was great.
Story_ID: 23328
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, so, now, were you--I didn't ask you a lot about popular culture.  But we were talking about color TV when we came in, but what's the significance of color TV in your story?  Does, is this the time for it or a little later?
Speaker 2: This is a good time.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, for us, you know, as you talk about technology, my father was a big advocate of reading.  And so he always thought television was totally against reading.  So, we only had a black and white TV until I went to high school, which was in '77' [1977], I think.  So, that's when we got our first color TV, even though color TV's came out in the 1950's.  So, it took a while to get a color TV, but it's not just where we just had a black and white TV, we had the black and white TV where you had to get the pliers to turn the channel. (laughter).  Because he would always say, "There's nothing good on TV, so why get something convenient only to watch that which is boring."  So, we had pliers.  We had the coat hanger in the TV until high school until, you know, you could actually get the channel.  And after a little while, you just said forget it, I'll just go read a book or go outside or do something, but not watch TV.  And when, you know, when I graduated, when I went to high school in '77' [1977], all of a sudden my father comes home with this big console TV, you know, color TV.  I go, "Why now?"  He goes, "Now you're not used to watching TV.  I can sit down and watch what I want, nobody's flickering the channels.  I don't have to worry about that."  You kind of go, "Where are the pliers?"  "It doesn't need any pliers, it has a remote."  We're all going... (laughter).  So, we were used to technology, but it wasn't always the latest technology, but you understood the technology that you had.
Speaker 1: Now, people watching this in the future won't understand, I think, that the actual changing of stations was done mechanically, by making contact.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So, it would be a like a cha choom, cha choom, cha choom, you know.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And a lot of people had pliers, because we'd wear out the plastic knob.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: The knob would crack--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and then you'd have to get pliers to grab the nib and then--
Speaker 2: Right, the plastic nib would still be there, and you could just grab the pliers and change the channel.
Speaker 1: Yeah, each station was a hard snap, like cha choom, cha choom, you know, rather than a--
Speaker 2: Right.  And you had UHF and VHF, you know.  So you would go to, I think, UHF and then you would go to another knob and turn the channel.  So, you actually had two knobs.
Speaker 1: Yeah, VHF, I mean UHF was more like a radio tuner.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Yeah, because it was on the same frequency as FM, but the VHF was a hard, you know, turn every time.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So, yeah, because people probably would wonder and say what are they talking about?
Speaker 2: Right.  So, it was that little plastic knob that still remained there beyond the one knob that had the numbers on it.  It would come off and crack.  And there was no need to get a new one because they would crack again, so you just got the pliers, and you began to know the stations.  It was only a few.  There weren't hundreds, there were, I think, like twelve, so you could take your pliers and go between twelve.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And it wasn't, there were twelve numbers, not always twelve stations.  There were three major stations of ABC, NBC and CBS.
Speaker 1: Right, right.  And then you had like a couple UHF stations in Chicago to go with them.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And Channel 9, I guess in Chicago.
Speaker 2: Right, the WGN.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Uh huh.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: It's a different time, different time.
Speaker 2: It is.  Now, you have, what, 200 channels and I still go, "and what exactly is on?" with the 200 channels, but--
Story_ID: 23329
Speaker 1: Now, you, you went to Maria High School.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And so, Maria High School is in Marquette Park.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: It's still Marquette Park where Dr. King [Martin Luther King Jr.]  was hit in the head with a rock, or a brick or something back in 1966.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: But you were there in--
Speaker 2: I was there--
Speaker 1: And started high school in what year?
Speaker 2: '77' [1977].
Speaker 1: '77' [1977], okay.
Speaker 2: And so, I was there from '77' [1977] until '81' [1981].  And my sister was there from '75' [1975] until '79' [1979].
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, your sister was already, was two years ahead of you, already there?
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: Now what was the, I didn't ask you this.  I should have asked you the racial makeup on Saint Leo.  Was it mostly black students, and--
Speaker 2: It was all black, maybe one or two white students.
Speaker 1: What about the teachers?
Speaker 2: So, the teachers were all black except for the nuns.  The nuns, because what's taught by some nuns--very few at the time, and so the nuns were white, but the teachers were black.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so you had, and you had also black male teachers.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Uh huh.
Speaker 1: Now, what about Maria?
Speaker 2: So, Maria was taught by the Sisters of Saint Casimir.  And it was majority nuns at that time that taught at Maria, and they were all white.  In terms of the student population, we may have like 300 girls in a class, and maybe fifteen blacks, so that's about five percent.  Yeah, so all the blacks, over lunch, you had a table where all the blacks would sit.  You know, each class--freshman, sophomore, junior, senior, would have separate lunch, and during that lunch there was a table where the blacks would sit for lunch.  And I remember the nuns coming over asking us, saying "Girls, why don't you mix with the other girls?" And we would say, "Sister, why don't they come over and sit with us?  We're in classes all day and we don't see each other.  Most of the time we weren't in the same classes, so lunch was our only time together, and we valued that time to catch up with each other.  It was very important.
Speaker 1: So, did you then have like a separate, like a separate social agenda from the white girls in school?
Speaker 2: We did, we did.  We did not go to the same dances.  And at the school, it's very interesting.  The Hispanic girls also had a table, a couple of tables.  The blacks, we only had one table (laughter).  But it's not where we went to the same dances, you know.  So, sometimes we would go, like the school would sponsor a dance, and we would go there.  And we would always laugh and go, okay, the blacks, we go, "Make certain you bring a date."  "Okay, how many guys are you bringing?"  Because it's all girls.  So, you go, "How many guys are you bringing, because we want to have choices to dance with."  Because, you know, we had to bring the black guys for the dancing.  (laughter). So, and it was hard to get them to come to Maria because they're, they're looking at it going well, you know, I only have your group of friends to dance with, if I want to dance with another black girl.  So, you know, we would each count, okay, you bring in one, okay we can switch up.  Okay, alright.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Don't come without a date (laughter).
Speaker 1: Alright.  So, you could make your social arrangements together--
Speaker 2: We did.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And we did that for prom.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Uh huh.
Story_ID: 23330
Speaker 1: Now, at Maria, now what was the, I take it your parents had you in Maria, one reason was that they had, it was a better school than public schools--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --in Chicago?
Speaker 2: Right.  So the issue that came up with public schools--because there were some great public schools.  You had like Lindblom, which was a technical high school.  I think the issue that came up with the public schools at that time, was actually the teachers going on strike.  And so, that was the big issue why we were in, for example, Saint Leo Elementary and went to parochial schools for high school was because of the teachers' strike.  At that time it was almost where the start of every year there was a teachers' strike, because that was the only way they could get a pay increase for that school year, was through a strike.  And that actually impacted the number of classroom times, or the number of days you were in a classroom.  And one year it significantly impacted the seniors graduating, because by state law, you have to be in the classroom a certain number of days.  So, they actually had to extend the school year.  It's really that reason that my parents said the parochial schools have a more stable schedule and you don't have to worry about the teachers going on strike, that we were actually placed in parochial schools.
Speaker 1: I remember there were epic battles between Jackie Vaughn and the Chicago Teachers Union and--
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: --Jane Byrne.
Speaker 2: Oh yes, with each mayor.
Speaker 1: Michael Bilandic and Jane Byrne.
Speaker 2: Oh yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so, yeah, so we ended up at Maria.  We found out from Maria, from Alicia Davis who was one of the alley rats from 77th and Lowe, she lived on Union.  And her mother talked about Maria as providing a good education, a good preparatory education for college.  And so, Alicia went to Maria and my sister went to Maria.  So, and they went together, and so with my sister being there it was natural that I would go there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 23331
Speaker 1: Well, how were you treated there, for the most part, at Maria?
Speaker 2: For the most part it was good.  The nuns were pretty good.  Some nuns did raise issues and say that we should be secretaries.  And so, because I was good in math, I was in the honor's math.  And some of the students, for the most part, the students were nice.  But you had a few that were outwardly prejudiced.  And so, one student I remember in my math class, the teacher said, you know, at that time, the highest grade you could get in the class is a 99.  And she said "Even if your grade is a 99, I reserve 99 for students that have only achieved 100 on all of their exams.  Otherwise, you get a 98, okay."  Because the highest score was a 99.  So, she said 99 means you get 100's on all of your exams.  Well, one student in the class, and this was in the honor's class, she said "I bet you'll never get that 99."  And I go, "You'll never know, will you?"  Because, and I--and she made it a competition.  And I told her, "I don't compete."  My parents always taught me, don't compete.  Do your best, don't compete, because you'll always find people better and you'll always find people that may not be as good, but what does that really give you?  Nothing.  Don't compete, just do your best.  And so, one semester, one term, I got the 99.  And so the teacher announced in class that there is a student that achieved a 99, but she asked that I not say her name, so I'm not going to say her name.  And that student looked at me, and said "Is that you?"  And again, I said, "You will never know."  And so, it just was very interesting that I was the only black in the class, and it appeared that it was the only one for which she had an issue within the class of every chance she got.  It was like, you know, try to have a put-down.  But, like you know, my parents always said, don't stoop to that level, and you just keep going and do your best.  So, you did have people that thought the worst of you.  So one nun, you know, she was saying we would only, the best we could do is to be a secretary.  And it's like, I'm not being somebody's secretary.  It's a good job, but that's not for me, no.  And then one nun told me that I was special because I was black and good in math.  And I went home and I told my mother.  I said "Mom, she said I'm special because I'm black and I'm good in math."  And my mother went up to the school the next day (laughter) and she informed them yes indeed I was special, but only because I was her child, and I was her baby child, and that was the only reason I was special, and outside of that, they had better not ever call me special ever again.  I was a normal child doing her very best as expected and beyond being Ollie Mae's daughter, there was nothing special.
Story_ID: 23332
Speaker 1: So yeah, but see, you did have things.  And I also ran track.  And one day after school while running track, somebody threw a rock and hit me in the back of the head with a rock.  Um, it didn't cause a concussion or anything of that nature, but I then quit the track team.  I just thought it's not worth it.  Uh--
Speaker 2: So, were you practicing that day, or were you in a meet, or what?
Speaker 1: I was practicing.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So, we practiced in Marquette Park, because that was the park right across the street.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's a, yeah, so, that's the place where Dr. King [Martin Luther King Jr.] was hit in the head with a rock.
Speaker 1: Right.  And see, it's very interesting, because Marquette Park was such that during the summers when we were growing up, the Nazis would march in Marquette Park.  And but, suddenly when school started, things would cease, and they would say it's okay, you know, for you to come to school.  But then after I got hit with the rock, the teachers were saying, well while we're out running track, they could follow me in the car or something like that, and it just wasn't worth it.  I told my mother, "I'm not great in track, so let's just move on to something else."
Speaker 2: Now, that was a real safety issue.  I mean, that was a real issue, that you were in a place that was surrounded by people with openly racist ideas, I guess, in Marquette Park--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --I mean the whole neighborhood.
Speaker 1: Right.  Because in Chicago growing up, there were divisions, you know.  At one point it was Western Avenue, you know.  Then it moved to Cicero Avenue, and there were certain parts that were clear delineations.  And I remember one time my sister went bowling because she was on the bowling team.  And she called us and she was like "Mom, next door the Nazis are meeting, and we just found out."  So, we were like "Okay, we're going to time this just right.  We'll call you when we're right outside and you all, you know, all the black girls, run to the car, just run straight to the car."  And then my mom drove off.  So we did encounter things that occurred, even in high school.
Speaker 2: This is the fellow, I mean the guy that ran the Nazi party was a very short man.  I remember Channel 2 profiled him and found out he actually had Jewish ancestry (laughter).
Speaker 1: (laughter).
Speaker 2: And he, yeah, he's kind of spoofed in the movie, Blues Brother.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: He was kind of spoofed in the movie.  It was the same person in Marquette Park.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: You know--
Speaker 1: Uh huh.
Speaker 2: --I used to call the Nazi hotline for fun.
Speaker 1: Uh huh.  So, we, yeah, so it was the Nazi, you know, they were actually having an active meeting.  So, we thought that's not a time for, you know, my sister...  My sister's like, that's not the time for black girls to be standing outside of the bowling alley waiting for the car.  So--
Story_ID: 23333
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, who were your favorite teachers at Maria [High School]?
Speaker 2: And so, I think my favorite teacher at Maria was Sister Margaret Zalot.  She was a science teacher, and I enjoyed science for the same reason I enjoyed math.  It's based upon clear facts.  And so, she was very encouraging.  She oftentimes, she would invite me to play volleyball with the nuns.  And so, soon she told me, she goes "You know, maybe you should consider being a nun."  I go, "No thank you, I appreciate it, but that's not for me.  You know, I plan to go to college like my brother and sister."  So, my brother and sister went to IIT [Illinois Institute of Technology].  But all the things that occurred in high school--my sister told me it was time for us to have different schools.  Because in high school, one year I told the students in high school that my sister and I were twins, because I wanted to see how far you could go with something.  And they were like "Really, but you're two grades apart."  And I said, "Don't tell anyone.  I flunked a grade, and she made a double.  That's why we're two grades apart."  I said, "But we're actually twins."  And so, it actually did get around to my sister.  And even though we're two grades apart, she was like "Valerie, people think we're twins."  "No."  (laughter).  So, when she went off to college, she said "No more, just let's go to different schools."  I think--because I wanted to see how far information would travel, and what information would travel, and how far things could go before people would question and go, "No, that can't be true."  So--
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, she wanted to be separated from--
Speaker 2: (laughter).  We went to the same elementary, we went to the same high school, so it was time.  And plus, you know, I think I was always known as Angela's younger sister, and I didn't mind.  You know, I was just like, I think that gave me protection.  So, but--
Speaker 1: So, I take it you graduated with honors from Maria?
Speaker 2: So, I did.
Speaker 1: Now, what kind of counseling, did the counselor you know, mention the secretarial stuff to you, or did they give you good advice about college?
Speaker 2: So, the counselor, so actually by the time I graduated from Maria, I was ranked in the top five, with the number of students.  I think one year I was ranked number two.  And so, the counselors then recommended that I go to apply to MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology], but I was not familiar with the different universities.  I was very familiar with IIT because we all went through what that time was the early ID program.  And so, but I--
Speaker 1: Kind of explain what that is for a minute, so we'll know.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So, the early ID program is a program offered by IIT for high school students, and I'm not certain what was the criteria.  I think it was grades, your grades in high school.  And what you did, you went there on Saturday and you participated in different experiments.  Like one experiment was the egg drop contest where you had to build a mobile to carry an egg, you know, in a car this distance.  And you couldn't, the car had to be powered by a rubber band, and you couldn't just do a sling shot, okay.  And so, another one was learning about prisms.  So, you learned about physics.  So, you went on Saturdays, and then you participated in these projects.  And the goal was to expose you more to science and engineering, to encourage you to pursue those majors once you got to college.  And we all--my brother participated, my sister and I participated.  And I would say I'm a more socialite, I would say, as you can tell by the stories that I tried to tell in high school.  And so, for my early ID--and it would be, "Okay, what's the happening thing tonight?  It's Saturday, so let's discuss first the social agenda for tonight, then we'll have time for the experiment." (laughter).  And it was interesting, our group, everybody called us the socialites.  But we came in second place only because a person dropped our egg, not because of our car.  (laughter).  They actually dropped it, and so then we couldn't finish the final challenge.  So we--
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, you were supposed to get the car, the egg safely there without it breaking?
Speaker 2: Right.  Uh huh, yeah.  And the person dropped it.  And I think we were probably over there laughing about something going on that night, and they dropped it. (laughter).
Story_ID: 23334
Speaker 1: So, you were counseled that MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology] might be the place for you to go.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: But, so was Purdue [University] part of the--
Speaker 2: Now, actually it was after my junior year in high school.  I went, I think, you take--during your junior year you take the PSAT's, which is the early version of the SAT's.  And I think because of my scores on the PSAT, then I was asked to participate or invited to participate in summer programs.  And so after my junior year, I participated in two summer programs, one for women in engineering, and I think it was University of Michigan and Howton [sic, Houghton], and one was the minority engineering program at Purdue University.  And so, the one for women in engineering and University of Michigan, I went to, and I think I was on the bus for like fifteen hours.  And that program was nice.  You got a chance to participate in hands-on activities.  But when I went there, there was only one other black woman participating in the program.  So, I remember getting there to the assembly hall where we were asked to meet.  And you do the scan, because you see all white students.  And you do this scan, and in the front, like, you know, in the second row, was the black girl.  So I went down to the front and sat next to her (laughter).  And we were the only two blacks for the entire week.  And at the end of the week, we were each asked about you know, applying, you know to the University of Michigan.  And I thought, no way.  Because in this program, while it's for all women, there was only one other black woman in the program.  And I just, part of me is the social aspect.  I think academically it's great, but you also need to balance with the social.  And I go, where are the social outlets?  And even walking around, I didn't see that many black students.  When in contrast, only a week after that, I went to the MIE program that was ran by Marian Blaylock at Purdue University.  And MIE stands for Minority Introduction to Engineering.  Well, this program had all black students, and we participated in the programs where you had hands-on with electrical engineering, bio-med, chemical engineering.  So, you spent a week on campus.  Now, in the MIE program we had a good time.  After we did our lab work and did our homework, we played bid, we had a good time laughing, it was a nice social outlet.  So, at the end of the week there, they said, you know, we want you to consider applying.  We all looked at each other and said if we all apply, we have a social outlet.  So, many of us applied, and in my freshman year at Purdue I knew a number of students that had participated in the MIE program.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That was, yeah--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  So, that part makes a difference.  So, I looked at other institutions as well.  So I applied to other institutions, but I really wanted Purdue.  And once Purdue accepted me, I told all of the schools no, because of the experience I had at the MIE program.  And granted, you get there, and Purdue is a majority white institution, but it was the fact that they recognized the need for community.  And they had a program that was set up to actually encourage and facilitate that community during the summer.  And then when you were accepted, and you actually accepted to go there, they had a program that spring for minority students who had accepted to actually enroll into Purdue, and we got to see each other again.  So, it was good.
Story_ID: 23335
Speaker 1: So, was your social life at Purdue, you know, enjoyable?
Speaker 2: It was good, yeah.  My social life was great. (laughter).  So, it was a nice community.  I think by the time I was a junior, I think my roommate at that time, she was the social sponsor.  So each week, I think--was it the junior year?  No, it was the senior year.  Each week somebody had a party at their apartment, okay.  And so, that was the social activity.  You got your work done, but you had to have a social outlet.  And so the blacks in engineering, we would get together, and it was so much fun.  And you got your work done.  First, you had to get your work done.  And we would tell people.  We had study groups, and we always said, you had to come with TA approved answers, meaning we divided up the problems.  You come to the study group, but don't come just with your answer of a guess.  You had to go and get your answer verified by the TA.  So my roommate Rochelle, at the time, she would always say, "Is it TA approved?"  "Then, go back and get it TA approved.  Don't come back again unless it's TA approved."  And you can't get everybody else's input until you come back with TA approved.  "Next.  Is it TA approved?"  You're like, "Yeah, uh huh."  "Which TA did you go to?  When?" (laughter).  "They don't have office hours at that time." (laughter).
Speaker 1: So, this is, so blacks in engineering, was that a, were you speaking in general or did you have an organization by that name?
Speaker 2: So, we had an organization.  It was the National Society of Black Engineers.
Speaker 1: Okay.  National Society of--
Speaker 2: Right.  National Society of Black Engineers.  It actually started at Purdue University in '73' [1973] [sic, the NSBE was founded at Purdue in 1975].  I think in '73' [1973], the first national conference was held.  But it actually started at Purdue.  And a group of us, we had EE classes together.  And that's where we had this study group that was really good because, you know, by the time you were a senior, your classes were hard, and you had to have a study group to make it.  And plus, you were also active in, you know, extracurricular activity.  So, you needed that study group with a balance.  And it also provided a social outlet.  So, for example in the study group there's actually the current CEO of McDonald's, Donald Thompson.  He graduated a year ahead of myself from Purdue University.  And so he, when you know, if we had a class together--he was in the social group because he, his girlfriend was Liz, and Liz was in my class.  So I was really happy to see this past summer when he was named CEO of McDonald's.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I still keep in contact with Jamie Moore, who is good friends with my sister now, because he lives out in LA.  We were part of the study group and we still laugh about things that occurred from undergrad, uh huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Who else was there that you remember?
Speaker 2: So, it was Sean Williams.  He works with General Electric.  Jerry Berth, he went back and got his MBA from Northwestern, from the Kellogg Business School at Northwestern.  Rochelle Jackson, who I think at some point she was with Ford Motor Company.  I'm not certain if she's still with Ford.  And I'm just trying to think who else was in our study group.  It was another person, I think Tommie, but I can't remember Tommie's last name.
Story_ID: 23336
Speaker 1: Now, this is, this is significant because it's been said over and over again with people I interview, and I've seen it, you know, in schools, you know--to really understand and succeed in science, you have to be in a study group.
Speaker 2: You do.
Speaker 1: Like most subjects in college, at a high level, you need to be in a study group.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And especially in the sciences.
Speaker 2: You do.  And oftentimes student believe, and I've seen it in students just in the classes I've taught, students believe that you have to do everything on your own.  And that's because in high school, in elementary school, everything is based on how you perform in terms of your test as an individual.  And you go home, you go to your individual home, and you work on your schoolwork as an individual.  But in college, you're in dorms and your classes are much faster paced and more in depth.  And you need some people to challenge you in terms of your understanding of concepts.  You need a group where you can explain the concept, because that's the best way to know if you understand it.  It's if you can explain in different deviations of that concept.  So, having that study group is critical to the success in terms of science and engineering, because your classes are fast paced and in depth.  And it's not to say--I think students have to understand what's the difference between cheating versus the difference between helping each other and challenging each other.  When you take an exam, you're taking an exam as an individual, as an individual, you know, so there should be no cheating involved.  But when you're working on homework and problems, you should challenge each other to understand the concepts.  It's not where you should just take someone else's answer and write it down.  So, for example, the reason why we had TA approved answers was such that you would go to the Board and explain your answer.  And we didn't want an explanation where you were going down the wrong path.  We wanted the explanation that was the right path, and that you asked questions if you didn't understand that path.  And now, you've brought back that explanation to the group.  So, if five of us required fifteen minutes, you know--if you had problems, five problems, and it takes you fifteen minutes to go through a problem with the TA, if it's five of us, that's each of us spending only fifteen minutes.  If it's one, then you're spending an hour and fifteen minutes with the TA.  So, it was, you know, time effective and more efficient to actually have each person go to the TA.
Story_ID: 23337
Speaker 1: Who were some of your teachers at Purdue, especially in the sciences, you know?
Speaker 2: So, some of my teachers.  I had Jose Fortez, I had Delp, Professor Delp, who taught a communications class.  I also had Professor Friedlander who taught a class on magnetics.  And it was interesting, because I remember with Delp, with Professor Delp, at one point everybody would say, "This is no help, Delp."  Because when you went into his office, he would make you go to the board, so everybody considered how that was helping?  And oftentimes when I got to college--I knew that for me going to college and with my parents paying for, at one time, three children in college, it was a big deal.  So, I always had in my mind, I need to do my best and do well, and not be afraid to ask questions, because my parents paid a lot for my education, so I need to take advantage of all the help I could get.  So, I was struggling with this one problem.  So I went to, you know, professor Delp, and he said, as he said to students, "You need to go to the board."  And I just told him, "You know what?  I am so confused.  Going to the board is not going to do anything, because all I can do is write down what the problem is.  I can't do anything beyond writing down the problem.  I don't know where to go.  I don't even know what variable to write next.  I know nothing."  And he looked at me, and he said "Okay, let me explain the problem to you."  And he did. (laughter).  And it was a big help.  And then I think later that night for the exam, a very similar problem was on the exam.  And he told the students, he said, "One person was correct, and came in and said she didn't understand." I was like "Oh my God." "She didn't understand what was going on, but that was okay because I explained to her.  By the time she left my office she understood it, and I can tell on this exam she really did understand it.  So, you all need to go out and make certain you understand it."  I was going "whew" (laughter) because that was a class, that was one of the elective classes, and I didn't have my same study group.  I was the only one, the only black student in that class.  Yes, it was a little different. (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Uh huh.
Speaker 1: Now, you sound like your mother [Ollie Mae Thompson Taylor] when you're telling that story.
Speaker 2: (laughter).
Speaker 1: I mean that's how she would have approached that kind of situation I think, you know.
Speaker 2: Right, uh huh.  That's the mother's side.  Like I (laughter)--
Speaker 1: That's the attitude, so it paid off.
Speaker 2: It did.  It did.
Speaker 1: So, so, was there any teacher that you would consider your mentor in college?
Speaker 2: I think that would be Marion Blaylock.  And she was the director of the minority engineering program [Minority Introduction to Engineering, MIE].  And Marion Blaylock was very encouraging.  And she would just tell you, you need to get your work done and stop playing around.  And she was very direct, you know, how are you doing in this class?  Well, go and ask a person.  Go out there and seek what you need.  And so, she was very encouraging overall for minority students in general.  And I would go see Marion.  And I think the interesting thing was freshman year.  So, freshman year you start off, and so they determine which classes you should be in, math or chemistry, based upon, you know, some pre-exams.  So, I was in advanced math but not the honor's math.  And my father [Willie James Taylor] told me, do well, don't worry about being in the honor's math.  I also took chemical engineering because I thought I should be a person with a white lab coat.  You know, that was an engineer.  And so, in my chemical engineering class, I remember this final project where you had to go through and figure out the elements that you had in your tube that was given to you at random.  And so, you know, with Marion Blaylock she had this minority engineering program class.  And she would tell us, make certain you understand the concepts in your class, and if you don't seek help and get what you need--and I was really surprised, well, happily surprised, that by the end of working out these chemicals--because I was just like oh, this is a large part of your grade.  How am I going to do?  But it turned out I got 100 on it, that I figured out all of the chemicals.  But then I think I soon realized that I liked electronics more than chemicals.  So, I switched to electrical engineering.  And she was very encouraging about my switch to electrical engineering.
Story_ID: 23338
Speaker 1: So, I was there, I was at Purdue from '81' [1981] through '85' [1985] for my bachelor's, and then I stayed for my master's where I finished in December of 90-- I'm sorry, December of '86' [1986].
Speaker 2: Okay, alright.  So, uh--
Speaker 1: And my last semester as an undergrad, I was considered a dually.  I was finishing up the undergraduate curriculum and taking classes for the graduate curriculum for the master's.  And so one of the teachers that I had in my graduate course, he told me, he said "You should get a Ph.D."  I was going, "Oh I don't know, you know.  I'm not familiar with a Ph.D., you know.  What does it require?"  He goes, "No, you should get a Ph.D."  And I kind of go, "Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Let me just finish your class."  But then I asked to work with the new faculty member who had just joined Purdue, Jose Fortez.  And it was funny, because I just went to Jose and said "I need an advisor, you're in computer engineering and it seems like an interesting topic.  Will you take me on as a student?"  And he was a new faculty member, so he just said yes without checking my record.  And then the next week we met he said, "Whew, I'm so glad, because you're an A student." (laughter).  I go, "Yeah, I guess you should have asked that first."  And then I go, "Whew, I'm so glad you're working in the area that interests me."  And he goes, "Yeah, I think you could have found out a little more about what I work on as well."  So, we worked well together for my master's.  And actually, we still collaborate on research projects now.
Speaker 2: Okay, alright.  Now when you finished your master's in '86' [1986], now you went on to U.C. [University of California] Berkeley.  But how did you make that decision?
Speaker 1: Oh, that was an interesting decision.  So what happened with U.C. Berkeley, as I was finishing my master's, I thought I would finish my master's and get a job and then maybe consider a Ph.D., okay.  Because I realized for my master's you had two options.  You could do the coursework only, or a master's thesis.  And I decided I was tired of courses, so I would take the thesis option, where you take fewer courses and work on a project, a detailed project.  So, that's what I did with Jose Fortez, is work on a detailed project in parallel computers.  And so, what happened, was working with him, he encouraged me to apply for the National Science Foundation graduate fellowship.  And I was saying no, because I just want to work, you know, after getting my master's.  He's like, no, no, you should you know, apply.  So, I applied almost so he would stop asking.  And then that spring I found out, I received the NSF Graduate Fellowship, which funds the Ph.D. for three years.  And he was saying, "Oh you have to accept this fellowship."  And I'm going, "No, I've interviewed for a job to work with Lockheed [Martin] out in LA [Los Angeles], I'll be near my sister, have a good time.  Hey, it's LA."  (laughter).  He's like, "Take the weekend off."  And that was the first time he had ever said take the weekend off because you can't, you know, decline this fellowship.  And I'm going, now there's a box here that says decline, and so it's okay, I can. (laughter).  And he's like, no you can't. (laughter).  So he, I took the weekend off, and during that weekend he had some people call me to talk about the benefits of the NSF fellowship.  And so, I talked to my parents.  And so then, this was in the March/April timeframe, and I was finishing up that December for my master's.  And I told him, "It's too late to apply to another program, and I don't want to stay at Purdue for the Ph.D.  I've been here for the bachelor's, master's.  It's time to move on.  All of my friends are gone, you know."  And he was saying, "Wait, talk to some people, because they may accept you late."  Well, one person called me from Purdue, that he had called.  And the person that called from Purdue was saying he had just served on the committee at U.C. Berkeley when they were looking at issues about minorities and their minority participation in their Ph.D. program in engineering.  He said let me make a phone call to Purdue and see what they would do, because you come in with your own funding, and you have a good record.  I'm thinking, oh, okay, alright, I'll wait.  And so Purdue--Berkeley, accepted my late application, and I ended up starting at Berkeley that following January of '87' [1987].  So that's how I ended up being at Berkeley.  It wasn't, you know, this major conscious selection, yeah, but it worked out very well.  And when I got to Berkeley, it was very interesting because everybody said things are done the Berkeley way.  And I go, "What's the Berkeley way?"  "You don't know?  This is Berkeley."  I'm going "Yeah, I know this is Berkeley, the rent controlled area."  (laughter).  "You have to give a presentation that's worthy of Berkeley."  And I go "No, I have to give a presentation that's worthy of Ollie Mae Taylor." (laughter).  But it ended up being a good experience, because my mother [Ollie Mae Thompson Taylor] went out there with me when I first started.  And she came back and told everybody at church, please pray for Valerie in this God forsaken place of Berkeley. (laughter).
Story_ID: 23339
Speaker 1: What did she dislike about it?
Speaker 2: Well, when she went there, okay, you know, Berkeley, so this is January, 1987.  So, we went to the campus and you have this man dressed up as a lady and they have the name Lady Man.  He wears a bra, a skirt, high heels.  He's protesting against something.  So, we walk on campus, this is what my mother [Ollie Mae Thompson Taylor] sees, okay.  We walk around campus, a lady is walking around with a pig, okay, with sunglasses on (laughter).  That's where I met Nancy Omatto, who's a faculty member here.  But Nancy Omatto was a grad student and she saw the horror and the look on my mother's face, and she's like "Can I help you all?"  (laughter).  So she helped us to get to the building where I needed to register.  While we're in the building, the alarm goes off for us to evacuate the building, because at that time there was the scare with the Unabomber.  But the Unabomber had delivered a package to U.C. Berkeley.  So, we go outside and everybody's telling my mother, "Yeah, you know, last time the Unabomber left a bomb in the building."  My mom says, "This building?"  I'm going, "Please don't say anything."  "Yes, this building, and one of the grad students got hurt."  "In this building, in this building?"  And I'm going, "Please, if you want me to stay, please stop talking."  And they kept going on.  And so, when my mother left, by the time she left, she's going "Valerie, there are so many other schools, are you sure you want to be here?"  I'm going, "Mom, at this point I have this fellowship.  I enjoy research, and this is the only school that accepted my late application.  I think I need to be here, and that, you know, I think it's meant to be."  But she prayed for me a great deal after being there.  And after a little while she began, you know, to, I guess value or to appreciate Berkeley.  I think she still has in her mind this weird place, you know.  And the first, you know, my first semester there I met the Devil Man.
Speaker 1: Who was that?
Speaker 2: So, the Devil Man was this man that at night he would dress up as a devil with a cape and horns.  And he would only come out and night and stand in the middle of the street.  And this was in Oakland.  So, one day I was going to the store, and I was going down this path that I knew.  When I made it to the store I told the guy, "You know, I think I'm seeing things, because I saw this guy that I think was dressed as a devil."  And they're like, then, everybody in the store goes, "Oh, you mean Devil Man?"  "I guess.  Oh, he has a name?"  They go, "Yeah, that's Devil Man, he's harmless.  He just likes to come out at night dressed as a devil and stand in the middle of the street.  But once he sees the street, you know, once he sees car lights, he gets out of the street."  And I'm going, "Okay, can you give me a different path on how to get home, because I think I want to avoid Devil Man." (laughter).
Speaker 1: So, what was the first character, in the dress and the bra and panties?
Speaker 2: Oh, that's Lady Man.
Speaker 1: Lady Man, okay.  So, Lady Man, Devil Man--
Speaker 2: And Lady Man actually was the ex-husband of a staff member at Berkeley, uh huh.  So, you just meet, you know, all types of characters.  But the good thing about it was, you know, after you get over that, you really, I really enjoyed Berkeley, because it was this political awareness there, of people talking issues.  And I got a chance to see Nelson Mandela when I was at Berkeley.  I got a chance to see Angela Davis.  You get a chance to see all these people you had read about.  So, you know, and different poets, Nikki Giovanni, who was home to Berkeley. So it was this great awareness of things going on, and people talking about issues, people talking about research that I really began to enjoy, people challenging each other, thinking out of the box.  And you go, oh, this is really a lot of fun.  So, it was a very good experience.
Story_ID: 23340
Speaker 1: Alright, now who was your advisor for your Ph.D.?
Speaker 2: So, it was David G. Messerschmitt, who was in digital communications.  And my research had to do with parallel processing and finite element analysis which is more related to civil engineering.  So, it was really outside of his area of digital communications, but it was a project that he was starting on when I started working with him, because originally I wanted to work in digital communications.  But my background was in parallel processing from Purdue [University].  And then he was looking at some issues outside of EE [Electrical Engineering], and finite element analysis.  So, I started working in that area and began to enjoy it, and stayed in that area.   So I got to know other people in civil engineering, and it worked out very well, even with him as an advisor being in digital communications.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 23341
Speaker 1: Yes, what is parallel computing?
Speaker 2: So, parallel computing is the simultaneous use of multiple computers to solve a particular problem.  And actually, today people have parallel computers in their PC's, because you hear a dual core, a quad core.  The chips now have multiple processing units on a particular chip, or multiple cores.  So, if an application utilizes all of those cores to solve a particular problem, that's where you're using parallel computing.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, I think the theory is, correct me if I'm wrong.  If a problem is broken up into pieces, then the one core will take one problem and the other one will take another one, and then put them together.
Speaker 2: Right.  It's different ways you can break it up.  So, you can break it up by the data. And that is all the cores do the same sequence of steps but on different data, and then bring it back together.  Or, you can break it up where the different cores do different parts of the computation, but they're all working on the same data.  So, there are different ways you can break it up, or some combination thereof.
Speaker 1: Now, does this, does parallel computing make the calculation faster?
Speaker 2: So, it makes it such that you get the answer, um, in less time, so, it does, it's faster.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And if you use it efficiently--because what happens with parallel computing is that oftentimes you have to communicate between the different processing elements, and so that communication can cost you significant time.  So, let's say if the computation is one unit, the communication may be a thousand units or more.  So, the communication time is what can slow things down.  So, if you have to do a lot of communication between the different processing elements, then it slows things down significantly.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what was the title of your dissertation?
Speaker 2: So, Efficient Use of Parallel Computers for Finite Element Analysis.  And so, it really had to do with sparse matrix computations.  And so, a sparse matrix is a large matrix that has very few elements in it.  So, most of the elements are zero.  So, it may be something that's a million by a million, and only have one percent of that matrix actually, have real numbers in it.  And so, how to work with computations with sparse matrix, because you don't want to store something that's a million by a million, and you're just storing zeroes.  And 99 percent are zeroes.  So, then you want to store just those values efficiently, but now, how to access those values efficiently, understanding the memory sub-system of your computer.
Story_ID: 23342
Speaker 1: David G. Messerschmitt.  And he's well recognized for adaptive filters and communications, and he spent significant time in AT&T before joining the faculty at Berkeley.  And he's since retired from Berkeley.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay.  So, did you find like, working on your Ph.D. to be enjoyable?
Speaker 1: I did.  And I still find today that I enjoy research, reading about what other people are working on, applying work of others and applying the work that we've done, to solve different problems in novel ways.  So, my research is still focused on parallel processing, but we look at [background sound]--should I start over?
Speaker 2: No, that's okay.
Speaker 1: So, my research is still focused on parallel processing, but we look at issues of how to make things run more efficiently.  So, it may looking at the communication between different processing elements, how to reduce that.  How to make certain that each of the processing elements are doing the same amount of work, so looking at load balancing issues.  One issue that's coming up today--because you have computers that may have, you know, ten, a hundred thousand cores on it.  Then you have to look at power, and that is the power management.  How much power is actually consumed by that machine?  Because as machines get larger they require more power.  But it may be where a facility has a power budget.  And if you have a power budget, you may look at running your applications that fit within that power budget.  So, lately we've been doing work looking at and exploring the relationship with power and execution time and changes that can be made to make things more efficient, both with respect to power and with respect to execution time.
Speaker 2: Okay, alright.  So, it was easy to defend your dissertation?  And, I mean, I know how it is somewhat, but not, you know--
Speaker 1: I think by the time I got to the dissertation defense, you're nervous because it is the defense, but you feel very comfortable with the problem that you've explored.  And I found myself answering questions that my committee didn't answer, didn't ask.  And I just said, "If you were thinking about it this way, you know, here's the approach and here's what would occur, and here's the reason why I really went down this path.  And if you were considering it this way..." And finally they said, "We're not considering it those ways, keep going.  So, okay, the next part of your dissertation."  And then I'm going, "If you consider this way..."  And they were like "Keep going, we didn't ask that question, keep going." (laughter).  So, it was very good.
Story_ID: 23343
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, you were part of the Black Engineering and Science Students Association, right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, tell us what that was, and some of the other people involved in it.
Speaker 2: So, it was the Black Graduates Science and Engineering Student Association, or BGSE, which was at U.C. [University of California] Berkeley.  And so, that organization consisted of the graduate, the black graduate students both in engineering as well as the School of Science.  And so, well, I'll say the College of Engineering and the College of Science.  And we would get together, we held a symposium where we had featured speakers come in.  And one year the featured speaker was my father [Willie James Taylor].  So, it was great.  We would also hold different social events to provide a social outlet.  And that may be, for example, going to a particular event, going to a play or participating in some activity on campus.  But we tried to have a social outlet for each other.  And especially--because I think working on dissertation research for your Ph.D. you will explore different paths and some paths may not work out.  And so, I think in finishing the Ph.D. is identifying the path that will work.  And it's nice when you have the social outlet when you encounter a path that's not working, because you can take a path, do something else, and then come back, and then have a different perspective and explore a different path.  So, it was really good.
Speaker 1: Okay.  How did your father enjoy being the speaker for BGSE?
Speaker 2: He enjoyed it.  It was great.  He talked about Sonicraft.  He talked about being an entrepreneur and an engineer, and he had a great perspective that was well received by everyone in the audience.
Speaker 1: Some of the memories of BGSE--we were talking off camera--by Kevin Kornegay of Georgia Tech [Georgia Institute of Technology] and--
Speaker 2: Right.  So, some of the members include Kevin Kornegay at Georgia Tech.  There's also Michael, I think, no, Jeffrey Streeter, who's also a faculty member at Georgia Tech, and Gary May, who is the dean at Georgia Tech.  So, Georgia Tech hires a great deal from U.C. Berkeley.  We also had master's students as part of BGSE.  So, we had Monique Baldwin who is in Atlanta [Georgia].  We've also had Charles, and I've forgotten Charles' last name.  It'll come to me when I least expect it.  But Charles--and it's very interesting, because Charles actually came up with a program name called Superb, which stands for Summer Undergraduate Program in Engineering Research at Berkeley, S-U-P-E-R-B.  And I think they still have this summer program, which is for minority students.  Because while we were there, all of us in EECS, we worked with Sheila Humphreys, who was the director of the minority programs in EECS.  And Sheila was a big advocate and strong supporter of all the minorities in EECS, the graduate students.  And we talked about how to get more minorities into the program, and we talked about having a summer program to bring out minority students to work on research projects during the summer, and then in that way, encourage them to return for graduate school.  And that was actually very successful. I think they expanded it to be all of engineering.  And so, it was Charles, who was also a good musician.  When we talking about the program, we're like, oh, we need a good name, and, you know.  And some of us are true to the name of engineering, where we think very structured.  And so, Charles was very creative.  And so we were all laughing and joking and so he said, "Superb."  You know, "Summer Undergraduate Program" and he just came up with this name (laughter).  But it was very good.  We were really active.  We, you know, in EECS we served on the graduate admissions committee to also help, you know, with increasing minorities in the Ph.D. program.  It was a very good experience.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, and I think you were saying off-camera that your father knew Dr. Robert Bragg, who is a material scientist at U.C. Berkeley who went to IIT [Illinois Institute of Technology], right?
Speaker 2: Right.  And I think his brother still lived in Chicago [Illinois].  And so he knew his brother as well.  And so, when he was out there I think Dr. Bragg was out of town, because they did try to connect.  So, yeah.
Speaker 1: Alright.  Did you ever meet Dr. Bragg?
Speaker 2: I met him, it was at a BGSE event, and so he was very supportive of BGSE.
Speaker 1: Okay, alright.  Now, okay, after graduation, you get your Ph.D. and--
Speaker 2: Yes.  I have to tell you this story, because everybody knows it.  With the Ph.D. program at Berkeley [University of California], it was really good.  But at one point I was the only black woman in the Ph.D. program, and there was another black woman who was from Africa, Arlene Cole, that was in the program.  But Arlene kept more to herself, and so Arlene wasn't really active in BGSE.  And after Arlene graduated, then I was the only one, which can be a bit isolating, to say the least.  So, having the black males, it was great.  But it's really nice if you have another black woman.  And so, the black women would come into EECS and be my roommate. (laughter).  So that's where, like Monique Baldwin was my roommate, and I had another black woman that was my roommate.  And I think one year, you know, with the graduate admissions, they would come to me and say, oh there's a black woman coming, you know, you might want to reach out.  And I was like, no, because they're only going to leave.  Nobody's staying for the Ph.D.  No.  And so then I'm sad when they leave.  But I ended up still befriending one when she came in.  But it was a bit, I think that was very hard.  So, I ended up reaching out to my family.  So I had family, and it's actually from my mother's father's side that I found out I had family in Oakland [California].  And so I reached out to them for a social outlet, which was really good.
Story_ID: 23344
Speaker 1: Okay.  Alright, so this is 1991, you get your Ph.D.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And you join the faculty at Northwestern [University] in '91' [1991], the same year.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So, okay, so how did that come about?
Speaker 2: Well, Northwestern was very interesting, because at that time there was another black woman faculty member at Northwestern, Janet Rutledge.  And Janet Rutledge is very interesting.  In the early years of the National Society of Black Engineers, Janet Rutledge was the vice-chair of the national organization.  So, everyone, you know, in SBE knew Janet Rutledge.  And Janet Rutledge contacted me at one of the NSBE [National Society of Black Engineers] conferences, the national conference in 1990 to say "You know, why don't you apply to Northwestern?"  And growing up in Chicago [Illinois], you know, you know about Northwestern.  It's this private institution in Evanston [Illinois], and I think I went to a game when I was in high school.  But I never thought about being a faculty member at Northwestern until Janet approached me.  And she was saying "I'm there, so it'll be good."  And I was going, oh wow, another black woman in the same department would be wonderful.  So, I interviewed at Northwestern.  I interviewed at other places as well, but I decided to accept the offer from Northwestern for a number of reasons.  One, their department was a combined EECS [Electrical Engineering and Computer Science].  And my area straddles the two, so having a combined department was really good for me.  I wouldn't have to choose, am I EE or CS, because I'm really computer engineering, which falls into both camps.  And the research that was going on at Northwestern, and then having Janet there was a big plus, because I would be in an environment where there would be another black woman, and that was really important to me.  And also a major factor was being around family.  So, my grandfather was getting older and I, you know, I grew up with my Uncle Alec, and I wanted to have some time with my Uncle Alec, because he was getting older--and being around my parents.  But I had to tell my parents, "If I move to Evanston, Mom, you can't come in and show me where to place the pictures and things like that.  This has to be my house."   And so, she was saying, "No problem."  Right.  (laughter).  But in any case, before I made the decision she would send me little snippets of information.  "Did you know that Mr. Chappelle from church, he went to Northwestern and graduated in 1950."  I'm going, "Thank you Mom."  Then she'd send me another snippet, "Did you know about Northwestern that..."  You know, she was sending me all of these snippets.  And my father was just saying, "Do what's best for you, whatever makes you happy."  And I was like, "Dad, this is an overwhelming choice to make."  He goes, "Valerie, there's no wrong answer.  You start one place, and if it doesn't work, you can leave and look at another place.  So, it's not the place for your entire career that you're trying to decide now.  You're trying to decide where you're going to go right now, and if things don't work out, you can go elsewhere."  And I was like, "Oh."  And that was very calming, and helped me make the decision to go to Northwestern.  And at that point in time they were just starting their computer engineering program.  So, another faculty member at, or another grad student at Berkeley, Bruce Homer, he was finishing up and had interviewed at Northwestern.  So, we contacted each other, and we agreed if we both go, we'll know each other.  We're both in computer engineering and we can help with that program together.  So, we both went to Northwestern, which was really good.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, I had family in the area, you know, my cousins, everybody.  You know, I had a colleague from Berkeley [University of California], you know, and then another black woman in the department.  It was great.  I just had to adjust back to the cold winters, but it was great. (laughter).
Speaker 1: This was 1991?
Speaker 2: Right.
Story_ID: 23345
Speaker 1: And we have your comment in the outline that you made that you were, that there was never an image of a black woman professor in your mind, because you'd never seen one.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: In all your years in school, you never saw a black woman professor, in college anyway.
Speaker 2: No, so I've never had a black woman professor stand in front of me.  So, I went to Northwestern in October of '91' [1991] and I started teaching in January.  And so, I went to Janet before teaching, and I'm going, "Janet, what earrings do I wear, how do I look?  Do I wear something ethnic?  You know, what should I look like in front of the class?"  And so, she just laughed and she said, "Yourself."  And I go, "But, Janet.  You know, and it comes to mind, I've never seen a black woman stand in front of me, so I don't know what it looks like, and I don't know how that person will be received by the students."  So, it was very overwhelming, you know, to prepare for the first lecture in class.  And you worried about all these different things, because you never had that image before.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And it really goes to the heart of having those images, uh huh.  Because then you could say, this worked, this didn't.  And without those images, I didn't know what worked and what didn't.  And you know, and that was the reason for asking the question, you know, can you wear something ethnic?  You know, how are you being perceived?  And so, you know, being yourself, yes, but you, you know, it's a wide range that you have. Because it's not where you wear all ethnic clothes, and you wear big earrings, little earrings, you know, jewelry.  What do you wear?  Do you wear slacks, skirts?  So, it's all these options.  And you're just going, you know, what worked and what didn't?
Speaker 1: So did you strike a balance in terms of--
Speaker 2: Yes, over time I began to feel comfortable wearing what I wanted to wear and not what I perceived I should be wearing.  And so, because if I feel comfortable in how I look, then it comes across in what I'm doing, that comfort.  Because you feel comfortable with the material, and I have no problems with being questioned and how to deal with questions, because I think at Berkeley you're constantly being questioned.  And so, your assumption is that if people ask a lot of questions, that means they're engaged.  If I give a presentation and I don't get that many questions, I think that's a bad presentation, because that meant that people did not find it interesting enough to challenge me in some way.  So, it's not where questions--that I wanted to avoid questions--but it was just the perception of how you're perceived as an instructor.  So it was, I think it took probably about a semester, and then I felt comfortable.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So--
Speaker 2: And I wore bright colors. (laughter). I wore what I wanted to wear.

Speaker 1: Right.  So, in '93' [1993], you received the National Science Foundation Investigator Award.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Now, what was that?  Was that for a specific bit of research?
Speaker 2: Right.  So, at that time the National Science Foundation awarded, it was the National Young Investigator Award.  And so, it's a prestigious grant that's given by NSF in recognition of your research, and what you have done and what you're proposing to do.  And so, it's that acknowledgement from the reviewers and the committee that you are, I guess, a rising young star with respect to your research.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, what was your teaching load like compared to research time?
Speaker 2: Okay, so my teaching load was actually, well, let me put it in context.  Northwestern is on a quarter system, which means during a full calendar year, there are four quarters.  So, during the nine month's time period, you have three quarters.  And so, my teaching load at that time was one course per quarter, or three.  And then after two years, it went up to four.  And that was the norm, was four courses over the academic year.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, you had a lot of time for research?
Speaker 2: So I did, I did.  And then I began to take on graduate students as well.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So, well, what kind of research were you doing when you won the NSF Young Investigator Award?
Speaker 2: So, I was, at that time I was doing research still in parallel processing, doing more in terms of developing models to represent the applications, and then using those models to provide feedback on ways to improve the applications.  And some of the models had to do with how to divide up a problem.  So, for example, in this--I guess for example with a parallel machine, it's not the case where all the processing elements are the same.  And it's not the case, especially when you have machines that may be at geographically different locations that are working together, the communication between the processing elements are not the same.  So, how do you divide up the problem to take that heterogeneity and the processing elements and the communication into account such that you can still balance the load across the processors.  So, looking at things like that across different applications.  So, I looked at applications that ranged in cosmology, civil engineering and modeling of brake systems with cars.  We looked, for example, in earthquake simulations, so it's a wide range of applications, and we worked with the application scientists to actually look at how to make things run more efficiently.
Story_ID: 23347
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, I met my husband--well, my I'm divorced now, so my ex-husband currently.  So, I met him at a friend's wedding and we got married in '95' [1995].  And I had my first child in '96' [1996].  And so, being promoted to associate professor with tenure is a big deal, because that's the tenure process.  And once you are promoted to associate professor with tenure, you're guaranteed a lifetime position at the university so long as you don't violate the rules, and the rules having to do with different forms of misconduct.  And so you're--and that's what the tenure gives you.  And the tenure was put in place for academic freedom, to allow you to explore different perspectives on issues without having to worry about your job.  And so, I was glad to get tenure in '97' [1997], and I did have to go through and give my tenure talk to the faculty, because they vote on your tenure case.  It's usually the department, the college, and then upper administration at the university.  So, when I gave my tenure talk I was nine months pregnant.  And the department chair said, "This was the first time we've had a pregnant faculty member give a tenure talk."  I kind of go, "That's a way to introduce me."  And so I told everyone, "I'm going to give the talk, if you allow me to give the talk without questions, so that I can sit down after I give the talk and answer questions.  Otherwise, I can only stand up for so long."  Because I think within two weeks after giving the tenure talk, I went into labor. (laughter).  So, we were trying to schedule that tenure talk.  So, I do have a balanced life.  I did go out and date, even, you know, as a faculty member.  And when I did get tenure, I had my first child also.  So, it was a really big deal. And my mother had a tenure party for me to celebrate my tenure.  (laughter).  So, that was fun.  It was like "Valerie has tenure, she has a permanent job, yay!"  And so, when you go to another university, you have to negotiate about the tenure, because sometimes as an associate professor going to another university, you may or may not go in with tenure.
Story_ID: 23348
Speaker 1: Well, tell us about some of your work during this period in '97' [1997].  You were working on computer rated designs and electronic systems and well--
Speaker 2: So, during that time, you know, I'd been working with performance analysis of applications, of parallel applications.  And around that time, grid computing had become popular.  And grid computing involves the use of multiple parallel computers at different sites to work together to solve a problem.  So, for example, if you need a computer with, at that time, let's say 10,000 processing elements and you have 6,000 at let's say the National Center of Super Computing Applications at Champaign Urbana and NCSA, and 4,000 at the San Diego Supercomputing Center, then how can you use those computers together at geographically different locations, but connected through high speed networks, how can you use them to actually solve the problem?  And that's where you're really taking into account that you have local networks within the computer.  You have wide area networks.  Now, these wide area networks are now shared.  So, the properties about those networks are very dynamic.  And then you're connecting with something, again, within the local network.  So, what we did was to look at some things like dynamic globe balancing, where you may sample the wide area network to see what the performance is at that point and time, and then adjust the load balance across the processing elements according to what the current performance of the wide area network is.  Then, what we decided to do in terms of our research group was to actually develop an infrastructure, a tool called Prophesy, and so it's the verb of prophesy, which is to predict.  And so, with Prophesy, we developed this infrastructure that included a database.  So, as we collect performance data, we can now have it automatically go to a database through scripts.  So, with Prophesy, it also included an instrumental, which allows you to instrument your application.  You execute it, and we get the performance data.  Now that the performance data is in the database, then we can then take that data and develop analytical models.  And those analytical models can be used in different ways.  The models can be used to say, what if I were to run on this different machine?  How would that application execute?  Is that better or worse?  What if I were to actually look at a larger problem on Machine B?  What would happen?  And so, you can actually look at different scenarios.  Or, you can say, what if I take this piece of the application and make it faster, what becomes the impact on the overall application?  So, we developed this infrastructure, Prophesy, to help with doing performance modeling and analysis for parallel applications.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, you have down here too, that you were working on developing a computer algebra prophesy, right?
Speaker 2: Right.  So, with Prophesy, what we were looking at was one of the modeling techniques that was what we called a coupling technique.  And it was called kernel coupling.  And with that we were looking at--usually an application may be composed of five to six kernels.  You know, it may be a solver.  It may, you know, do some analysis and different components of the application.  And so, the question that comes up is if you can develop models for these kernels.  Then when you take the kernels and put them together, depending upon the data, the kernels would have different amounts of interaction.  And so, if we model that interaction in such a way that it's constructive, that they help each other, so when this kernel finished some data, it's left in the memory to be used by this next kernel.  That's really good.  So, looking at the kernel coupling and that modeling, we were able to change around some data structures such that we could better utilize some shared resources, like your memory to help make the application more efficient.  And it's interesting now, because our current research, we have a current project that's funded by the National Science Foundation that's for a total of $2.4 million that's a collaboration with us here at Texas A&M, researchers at University of Tennessee in Knoxville with the PAPPY Project, and researchers at Virginia Tech with a power pack, where we're putting the three tools together to explore performance and power.  So it represents, and it's called MUMMI, and it represents a multiple matrix modeling infrastructure.  And so, it's an aggregation of, well, it leverages from Prophesy that I lead from power pack that's led by Kirk Cameron and PAPPY, that's led by Shirley Moore, and the researchers Willie and Jack Lengara (sp).  So we're working together on MUMMI.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you have some great names.
Speaker 2: (laughter).
Speaker 1: The National Science Foundation founded Prophesy in 1999?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And MUMMI is the current evolution of that project?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It stands--
Speaker 1: The acronym is M-U-M-M...
Speaker 2: MUMMI.
Speaker 1: 'I', okay.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 23349
Speaker 1: In 2000, NSF [National Science Foundation] founded something called GriPhyN, and it's, I guess that sounds like how you pronounce it right?  GriPhyN?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Which stands for?
Speaker 2: So--the Grid Physics Network, or GriPhyN.  And so, I was part of that project.  The leaders on the project were actually from the University of Florida.  On that was Paul, and Ed Foster out of Argyle National Labs.  And the goal there with the GriPhyN network was looking at the fact that in high energy physics that they're, you know, we're currently generating large amount of data from things like the large hydrogen collider that's at Sony.  And so, with the generation of a large amount of data, physics has this community where they're utilizing that data a different way to further develop the science in the area of high energy physics.  And so, when you have all of these files, and it's like petabytes, which is ten to the 15th byte, so that's fifteen zeroes, in terms of your number of bytes.  And so, when you have that large data that's distributed across the world, how do people access it?  How do they utilize it?  How can they leverage from what each other's done?  And so, our part of that GriPhyN project, we were looking at, again, the performance analysis with respect to the applications that were being used.  So, we got a chance to work with some of the high energy physicists--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --with the GriPhyN Project.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, you were working on, during that same period you were working on new approaches to human potential realization through information technology research.  Was that funded by NSF, too?
Speaker 2: That was also funded by NSF.  And so, it was a project that was led by Bryant York, who is at Portland State University.  And so, with that project in developing human capital, it was a very unique project.  It was funded, at I think like $1.3 million.  And so, with that project, it involved social scientists; it involved people from education.  Again, I was doing some of the performance analysis.  We were looking at a system called AADMLS, which is African-American Design--wait--for Multiple Learning System.  And so, for multiple learning style system.  That was--it's AADMLS
Speaker 1: A-D-
Speaker 2: A-A-D, for African-American Design--for Multiple Learning Style System.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And this was developed by Ron Gilbert, who's currently at Clemson [University, South Carolina].  And so, with that particular system, it's geared toward having, let's say, avatars or faces, different faces that you can have.  See, you can have a face that looks like you.  You can have a face--whatever type of face you want, you can have as your avatar.  And the system actually allows students to explore different learning styles.  And the learning style could be where you present a concept first, then examples after the concept.  You could also have it where you present examples first to build up to a concept.  So, different ways of learning that a student could use.  And so, the system will give you problems about a concept, and based upon how you do, it would either go to a different learning style to help you learn that concept, or move on to a more advanced concept.  And the focus was on algebra.  And so, we were looking at the use of hip-hop culture and the use of the AADMLS system.  And so, it was, it was really good.  We had researchers--for example, Charles Isbell, who is in machine learning at Georgia Tech was involved.  And so, Charles was very interesting, because he finished his Ph.D. at MIT and he's a faculty member in machine learning at Georgia Tech.  But he's also very well-known in the hip-hop world.  His hip-hop name is Homeboy from Hell.  (laughter).  And so, I bet many people don't know that about Charles.  But, he used to analyze the lyrics for hip-hop.  And so, it's very interesting, his involvement.  So, sometimes there's a meeting where we were talking about hip-hop--we would do this challenge with different music, and say, you know, "Who knows the artist?"  Well, of course, Charles knew every single artist.  (laughter).  The rest of us would be struggling, like, "Who, who is that?  What is it they're saying?"  So, it was, it was a very unique project that has had a really great impact, because AADMLS is still available now, and it's still moving forward.
Story_ID: 23350
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, in 2001 you received the Path breaker Award from the Women in Leadership at Northwestern University and the Hewlett-Packard Harriet B. Rigas Education Award.  So--
Speaker 2: Yes.  So, I think in 2001, so at that time, I was going out giving talks about my research and making strides with research.  But I was also starting to become more involved with outreach.  And that's out-reach both with women and minorities.  And so, with the different out-reach activities, especially in terms of women, then that's when I was recognized at Northwestern with the Women's Pathbreaker Award.  And then with education, I was also very involved at Northwestern, of starting a peer teacher's program.  So, one thing we looked at at Northwestern was the work with Uri Triesman, who's now a faculty member at U.T. [University of Texas] Austin.  But, when he was at Berkeley [University of California], he did this study to understand the problems that minority students were facing in math, and found that the Chinese students were working very well as a group.  And it was a peer group.  So, it goes back to what we were talking about, of having the group study when I was an undergrad.  But at Northwestern, being so close to Chicago [Illinois], I just felt like the minority students did not really have a community.  And so they did have NSBE [National Society for Black Engineers], but it wasn't as strong like at Purdue [University].  I mean, because Purdue, you're in West Lafayette, you're in the middle of cornfields.  It's not--the closest city is Indianapolis [Indiana], which is an hour drive.  You know, Northwestern, Chicago is fifteen minutes away.  So, in any case, we looked at in engineering that minority students were having a hard time with like the first year classes.  And so, we looked at the work of Uri Triesman.  And I wrote a proposal at Northwestern--
Speaker 1: Now this is, you're, I'm sorry, can you spell that name again.
Speaker 2: Triesman is T-R-I-E-S-M-A-N.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.  And so--
Speaker 1: Okay, the first name is U-R-I?
Speaker 2: Uri, U-R-I.
Speaker 1: Okay, Uri Triesman.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Right.  So, we looked at his work, and we started a program at Northwestern where we had peers.  It was first open to minority students, a focus on minority students, where they would work as a group with a facilitator.  And the facilitator would be a student that would be one year maybe above the current student.  And so, they would facilitate a discussion about problems related to their class.  It would not homework problems, it would be supplemental problems.  And the goal was to get the students as a group, of about six or seven, and to challenge the students as a group with the hope that over time the students would see the value of that, and begin forming their own groups in other classes.  And so, we did go through and see that the grade point average of the students that participated in the peer teacher's program actually did better in terms of their GPA.  And so, I think that work actually led to the Harriet B. Rigas Award, which is given out--it's sponsored by Hewlett-Packard, and it's given out by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Computer Society, so IEEECS.  So, I was recognized for that award with the Rigas.  And so, I have a plaque that was signed by Carly Fiorena from Hewlett-Packard, as well as the Chair of IEEECS Computer Society.  So, it was a great recognition.  And it was interesting--because my son had an ear infection.  So, I decided, I wrote a speech, and I decided not to go because of his ear infection.  And so, they told me they did give the speech, which was really nice.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Somebody else read it?
Speaker 2: Pardon me?
Speaker 1: So, somebody else read the speech?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, 2001 you also received, you coached--here, I'm sorry--the Richard Tapia Celebration of Diversity in Computing Conference.  Now, this is a, was this at Northwestern?
Speaker 2: No.  So, this one, it's, and this goes along the lines of the outreach.  So, there's an organization called the Coalition to Diversify Computing, which is a joint organization of the computing societies, and that is the Association of Computing Machinery, or ACM.  The Computing Research Association, which is CRA, and IEECS Computer Society.  So, you have ACM, CRA and IEEECS, each of the three major organizations in computing, actually wanting to do something about diversity.  And so in 1999, they started an organization, a joint organization of the three societies, called the Coalition to Diversify Computing.  And in--sorry, that started in 1996, because it started when my son was born.  And in 2000, they asked me to co-chair CDC, which I agreed to do.  And part of it was the recognition that something needs to be done to raise visibility about diversity in computing.  And so, we started a conference that was named after Richard Tapia at Rice University, because of his work in both--he does work in applied mathematics and optimization, but he's also done great work in terms of increasing diversity in the sciences overall.  And so, he's a member of the National Academy of Engineering.  This year, he just won the Presidential Medal of Science.  And so, we named it after Richard Tapia, and it was the celebration of diversity in computing, modeled after the Grace Harper Celebration of Women in Computing.  And so, we held our first conference in Houston in 2001, which was a big deal, because if you recall, that was 911 in 2001.  And so, our conference was held in October, yes.  And we ended up with really good attendance and great sponsorship.  So, we ended up with a plus for the conference, even though it was the first time holding the conference.  So, the conference, the goals of the conference are to celebrate the diversity in computing.  And so, it's for minority students and all students to actually see that there are contributions being made by all, that it comes from the diversity, that we have contributions in computing, and so they can see diverse researchers giving talks.  They have diverse faculty and diverse researchers and practitioners from industry.  And so, it becomes something for students, both undergraduate and grad students, faculty and professionals.
Story_ID: 23351
Speaker 1: And it's still being held today.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So, it's--
Speaker 2: Is Richard Tapia still alive?
Speaker 1: Yes.  So, Richard Tapia is at Rice University [Texas].  Actually, we just talked yesterday (laughter).
Speaker 2: Okay, alright.
Speaker 1: And so, the next conference is going to be in February.
Speaker 2: Is there, well, is there any specific story about something he did that you could tell us, I mean, the--
Speaker 1: Well, it's very interesting.  With Richard Tapia, there was this one documentary called Breakthroughs.  I don't know if you're familiar with that.  It's called Breakthroughs in Science.  It was produced by Henry Hampton.  Does that name sound familiar?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Henry Hampton, the same person that produced--
Speaker 1: Eyes on the Prize.
Speaker 2: Eyes on the Prize, yeah.  Black Side, Incorporated.
Speaker 1: Right.  So, Henry Hampton decided to do a documentary about different scientists, minority scientists.  And so, I don't know, my name popped up for computer science, computer engineering.  And to my surprise (laughter), they decided to feature me in the documentary.  And so, I was featured under science for mathematics and computer science.  And in the documentary, the same documentary, was Richard Tapia.  So, in looking at the one-hour documentary, where they had twenty minutes on each of us, that's where I got know Richard Tapia.  And it's, Richard is a very fascinating man who's very encouraging.  He's a major advocate and very direct about the need for diversity.  So, he's Hispanic, and he has, like he went to community colleges in L.A. [Los Angeles] and things like that.  But, we met through that documentary, and then later we met in person, and this was before the actual conference.  But we could laugh about the documentary and what was featured in the documentary.  So, I got to know him through the documentary first, and then got to know him much better afterwards.  So, it was an honor to name the conference after Richard.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And he's participated every year.
Story_ID: 23352
Speaker 1: Now, you became a full professor [at Northwestern] in 2002.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And, let's see here.  Now, you were the general chair that same year, of the Grace Harper Celebration of Women in Computing Conference.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And so, that was a very interesting year, because I became full professor.  I was the Grace Harper general chair, and I also interviewed for the position of department chair at Texas A&M [University].  So, it's very interesting how that came about.  It is due to, I think, the visibility of serving as general chair of Grace Harper, because at the Grace Harper conference, you know, people approached me about Texas A&M.  And I was coming down to give a talk, a technical talk, invited by a colleague, Karen Butler Perry. And so, and coming down to give the talk, I ended up interviewing for the department head position, and actually received an offer, and decided to accept the offer for the department head position.  But it's interesting here with Texas A&M [University], because when I graduated in '91', [1991], I also interviewed at Texas A&M as a faculty member.  And I came down and gave a talk.  And I have to tell you this funny story.  Because I gave a talk, I came down.  And Karen Watson, who was a professor in EE at the time, she along with some minority women graduate students, took me out to dinner.  And so, I think the restaurant may have been called Exchange.  So, the next day I gave my talk, and I go out to lunch with some of the faculty in EE.  And they take me to the same restaurant called Exchange.  And they said, "Well, it's a new restaurant in town, we want to try it."  Well, that night I went out to dinner with a black faculty in engineering and his wife.  And so we're driving.  I go, "You know, this area looks familiar."  And they drive in front of the same restaurant (laughter) called Exchange.  And I just thought, I'm not getting out of the car now.  That's it, I know you have another restaurant here.  So, can we please go to another restaurant?  And they laughed, because his wife, actually, she's from Gary [Indiana] and we knew each other.  And she laughs, she goes, "You're not coming here.  You know, you grew up in Chicago, we've taken you now to the same restaurant for the third time."  I go, "And you know, people are talking about the Wal-Mart that's being built here."  I go, "This is a small town. (laughter).  And so, and I asked, I go, "What about the social life for a black single woman?"  She goes, "Well, my dear..."  And I go, "That answered it all."  So, I decided not to take the offer.
Speaker 1: That was in '91' [1991], right?
Speaker 2: Right, in '91' [1991].  But then, now interviewing, you know, in 2002--you know, at that time I was still married and had two children.  So, now you have a different perspective.  So, you're looking at family life, looking at children--
Speaker 1: Schools.
Speaker 2: Schools, you know, price of houses.  Things look a lot better.  Now, the fact that people are focused on now building the second Wal-Mart here, okay...  But that's okay, because you know, you go to Wal-Mart and get your children's clothes because they're growing so fast.  So, you know, all of a sudden the town looked different.  It was a good opportunity, so we decided to come.  And my parents, because my children had grown up with my parents, you know--they were only three and six at the time.  But my son had spent every Friday with his grandpa, so that's his buddy even till today.  The relationship he has with his grandfather is really unique.  And my father took him to parks and all this stuff, you know, because he was retired when Theo was born.  So, it was really good.  And so, my father came down with me during my follow-up visit and fell in love with the area because of the housing, the prices of houses, low crime rate, you know, low traffic, good weather, no snow.  So, he was over here saying, "Oh, this is a great time."  And I'm like, "Dad, I'm trying to negotiate."  He goes, "But, you know, Valerie..."  And people go and say, "Are you coming?"  I go, "No, no, I need to negotiate."  And so, people are saying, "Well, he's pretty positive."  I go, "I don't know him.  I'm trying to negotiate, and I don't know if I like the place until I get the right offer.  Then I'll let you know if I like the place."  (laughter).  So, the offer turned out to be really good, and we all came.
Story_ID: 23353
Speaker 1: Okay.  One thing I forgot.  We can come back in a minute and talk about the Institute for African-American E-Culture.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: You were one of the founders of that, and that was, I think the year before you came here.
Speaker 2: Right.  So, and I can tell you, but--so, the Institute of African-American E-Culture actually started around the time that we got the NSF grant.  And so--
Speaker 1: Back in 1999, 2000?
Speaker 2: Right.  And that's when we got the Building Human Capital Grant.  And so, that's when we had the Institute.  It was really focused with the grant.  And so, unfortunately with the ending of the grant, everybody returned to their research activities.  And so, the IAAEC didn't go further than the grant.  But since then--and one person that was a leader with IAAEC, Bryant York, we've actually worked together to start a new center.  And so, this center is started with Bryant York, who started IAAEC.  Also, Richard Lattner at University of Washington, who does a lot with people with disabilities.  It started with Ann Gates, who does a lot with the Hispanic-serving institutions in the Hispanic community, and Ron Eglas who does a lot in ethnical computing, or using culture to teach computing, or ethnical mathematics.  And so, we've started a center that's called the Center for Minorities and People with Disability in IT, or CMD-IT, which we call Command It.  And so, Command It became incorporated in a non-profit organization.  In fact, just last year, February of 2011-- and it's now been operational for about two years.  And we have a number of workshops where the focus is on African-Americans, Hispanics, Native Americans, and people with disabilities.  Because we look at the fact that culture-- you have to understand the culture to be truly inclusive.  And so, all of our activities focus in that area, and we look at the mission as being two-fold, as the engagement from those communities in computing, but also using innovation in computing to enhance those communities.  So, for example, this year we held our first what we call Diversity as an Innovation Resource Workshop, where the goal is to look at projects that focus on increasing diversity and working together to solve a societal problem.  And the problem that we focused on was on mass education delivery for middle school students and under-served communities using mobile devices.  So, we held a workshop at AAAS [American Association for the Advancement of Science] and developed projects that we're now reaching out to different communities to develop those projects.  And our goal is in 18 months to have some deliverables to some school systems that look at mobile devices and complement what's being done in the classroom, but also have a cultural component as well.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And who's generating the cultural side of it?
Speaker 2: So, the cultural side is all of us.  So, we look at the different literature out of sociology, different areas, out of education that have to with engagement across those communities in education and also in computing.  And we also have a collaboration with the Center for Culturally Relevant Education and Assessment, called CREA, that's out of Champaign-Urbana [Illinois].

Speaker 1: Alright.  So, alright, so, Texas A&M [University].  We're here at Texas A&M in 2002, right?
Speaker 2: Right.  I actually started in January of 2003 as the department head at Texas A&M.  And so, I served as department head for eight and a half years.  So, I sat down just last year, May 2011.  It was a good two terms as department head.  I think, department--we grew by one-third in terms of the faculty size.  We grew in research, expenditures, and we grew in terms of relationship with industry.  And it's a lot of very positive programs, but I felt that two terms as department head was good.  And I told the faculty when I came, I would not serve any more than two terms.  But it gives me time now to go back to work on research and outreach full-time, because those things took a back burner while serving as department head. But it gave me a global perspective, I think, across the field, because you're looking at across the faculty now.  So, you have a broader perspective and, plus, you have, I think, a different view of the university.  And you really learn the details of budget management.  So, we operated in black, which was great.
Story_ID: 23355
Speaker 1: Okay.  Tell us about NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration] URETI [University Research, Engineering, and Technology Institute] and OptIPuter.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So, the NASA is the NASA URETI  Program, which is the Universe Research Program.  And this project is related to nano-computing, the use of very small devices.  And so, the leader of that project was actually at Purdue, and that was with Jose Fortez.  And my role, again, it relates to performance analysis, but we were looking at different ways to add redundancy to nano memory.  And how to add that redundancy--because you have to worry about faults with nano memory, and so, how to compensate with faults by having some redundancies with the nano memory, and that was good.  So, I actually had a Ph.D. student that finished with that project, finished his dissertation.  And he's now at the Office of Naval Research.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then the OptiPuter, which was led by Larry Smarr at U.C. San Diego.  An OptiPuter was based upon looking at the optical network, which is a high speed network where you have computers off, dangling off of the network.  And so, the issue that comes up there is not so much the focus on the computing devices at the end, but efficient use of what the high speed network can give you in terms of, now, that opti, the optical network.  And so the optical network becomes the central point.  So, now you can do things such as--it changes the way you can collaborate, when you can deliver things at a very high speed and high resolution.  Because you can have people that are doing work in the bio-sciences that are collaborating at geographically different locations, and you may do some computing along the way in your optical network, but the focus was not just on the in-points, but it's what you can do in between.  And so--and how to utilize that optical network efficiently.  So, we were looking at some performance in terms of data transfers between different sites and the computation that's being done on that data as it's being transferred.
Story_ID: 23356
Speaker 1: Okay, alright.  So, going to--in 2004 you became the Royce E. Wisenbaker Professor here as well as serving--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Well--
Speaker 2: Well, prior to that--so when I came in, I was the chair, but I also had a professor.  It was the Stewart & Stevenson Professorship.  But then in 2004, I was given the Royce E. Wisenbaker, which has a larger principal than the Stewart & Stevenson.  So, it was a larger professorship.  And that was in recognition of my research that was still going on.  So, when I came to Texas A&M [University], it was very interesting.  When I came, I felt like it was almost like at the height of my research, because my research had taken off as an assistant professor.  You get tenure, it continues, and that's when I was with Prophesy.  And I actually brought five grants with me to Texas A&M, and left three grants at Northwestern [University].  So, it was, you know, you're part of these different projects related to performance analysis, and it was really good.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  So the professorship changed to be the Royce E. Wisenbaker Professor, which had a larger endowment.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You received the Richard A. Tapia Achievement Award in 2005 and, now in 2008 you served on the Board of Directors of the Computing Research Association.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Had you been a member of that association a long time?
Speaker 2: Well, with the Computer Research Association, with my involvement in the Coalition to Diversify Computing, then I had interactions with the Computer Research Association.  In 2002, I also received the Nico Habermann Award, which is given out by the Computing Research Association.  And that was for my work in large part with the Richard Tapia Conference, with starting the Richard Tapia Conference, but for my work in increasing diversity in computing.  And so, in 2008, I entered my name for election to the board, because you were elected--well, let me just back up.  The Computing Research Association represents, is focused on the computing research across the field, or the research component.  And so, it includes primarily Ph.D. granting institutions or institutions for graduate programs that are members of the Computing Research Association, as well as labs, national labs, like Intel, you know, different--IBM is on it, and Yahoo is on there.  And so--I think Yahoo, I need to check.  But in any case, so, with that board you can have a faculty member be nominated to serve on the board, and you're elected by the department chairs that are members.  So, it's probably about 180 institutions and labs that are members.  And so, they vote on the slate to be elected to the board.  So, in 2008, I was elected to serve on the CRA Board.  And then I was re-elected last year in 2011, so it's for a three year term.  So I'm currently still on the CRA Board until 2014.
Story_ID: 23357
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, I don't know, but there are three papers here highlighted for 2009.  One is An Open MP Approach to Modern Dynamic Earthquake Rupture Along Geometrically Complex Faults on CMP Systems.
Speaker 2: Okay.  (laughter).
Speaker 1: Another one, A Definition of Open MP, Open Multi-Processing.  Let's see, again, I don't--
Speaker 2: Okay.  So, let me just tell you about the papers.
Speaker 1: Alright.
Speaker 2: So, my current research still relates to performance analysis, modeling and refinement, and so some of the current papers that you'll look at was Open MP.   So, Open MP is the language to explore with parallel processing, that's based upon the underlying premise of having a shared memory.  And what you do is, you launch threads, what they call, and the threads share memory.  And so that's a way to use the cores.  You can also have it based on message passing, or MPI, in which case it's not based upon a shared memory model, it's based upon memory being in these different cords and you having to communicate explicitly.  So, there are different ways of actually doing that sharing of data that's represented in the language.  And so, that's when you see some of the papers, Open MP and MPI.  So we look at different paradigms for different languages used in parallel processing, and look at the performance and how we can improve that performance.  And you'll see, some of the papers will range in the application area, like the earthquake simulation.  It could be lattice boltzmann, which is used for turbulence modeling.  It could be cosmology.  So, it's a range of applications that we look at, high energy physics, where we're looking at those applications and exploring how better to actually perform that communication so that you get a reduction in the execution time.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And sometimes we can get like a 15, 20 percent reduction in execution time, which is pretty significant.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, there's a number of papers here that-- I'm not going to try to pronounce all of them.  (laughter).  And so, I'm trying to decode all of them.
Speaker 2: (laughter).
Speaker 1: But, what have been the highlights of your research up to the moment?
Speaker 2: I think some of the highlights--the current highlights have to do with some of the work with the performance and the power, because the power is becoming a major issue when you get to large scale machines.  So, you have machines that have a hundred thousand cores in it.  And so, to use a hundred thousand cores efficiently becomes a major issue, but also the power consumption.  You have machines now--you may have heard the term GPU, a graphics processing unit.  Those are also being used, which is a different way of using the cores.  We look at how to, again, reduce that time.  Things become more efficient, and the reduction in time is pretty significant because--to give you an example, like the earthquake simulation and the granularity in which you need to have the grid to really understand the earthquake simulation.  It may take you something like, you know, two months to actually run it on a single processor, you know, two or three months.  And then you try to run it on something that's ten thousand cores or a hundred thousand cores, so then you could be down to hours, and you really want to be down to minutes with an execution time.  And so, reducing it by 20-30 percent is a big deal in terms of helping it to run more efficiently.  And what we've been doing is looking at a range of applications developing different models, and I think developing different ways of--and the models and the refinements may have to do with the data structures that are being used.  It may have--which relates to how data is represented in the application.  Or, it may be the data layout, you know.  So, there are different changes that we can do with an application to make it run efficiently.  And as we explore different techniques, we'll publish a paper about those techniques.  And we also learned from the broad community, from their papers, about what's being done with other researchers.   So, you collaborate together with those papers.  So, for example, the latest project related to MUMMI is a collaboration with--we've been doing work with developing analytical models.  The group at Virginia Tech has been doing work with power measurement.  And the group at University of Tennessee in Knoxville, they've been doing work with hardware counters.  So, you put our system together where we have modeling, hardware counters and performance, and now you can do that exploration.  And so, that's what we're starting to publish--doing work with the power and the execution time, so, that combination.  So, is it the case that a lower execution time means higher power?  Can you reduce both power and execution time in some way?  Or, will you have to have some increase in execution time to get a decrease in power?  A lot depends upon the application and the way that application is implemented.  So, you're looking at those aspects.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: So, that way you don't have to go through all the different--but that gives you an overview about the paper in some way.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  It reminds me of photography in some ways, I mean the way the--
Speaker 2: The tradeoff that you do?
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Speed for quality, and that sort of thing.
Speaker 2: Right.  So, you're doing those tradeoffs.  And see, it's different for different machines and different configurations.
Story_ID: 23358
Speaker 1: Now, what are some of your hopes and concerns for the African-American community today?
Speaker 2: That's a very good question. And so, I think when I look at hopes and concerns, I look at my children. And so, my son Theodore who is fifteen, and my daughter Jasmine, who is twelve. And you look at what they're facing and the issues that they're dealing with.  And so, part of my concern is that we as an African-American community really understand our heritage.  And by understanding our heritage, it's not just from those who have gone before us, but it's also from those who are around us, and that appreciation, especially from those who are around us, because working together you can do so much.  But if you're only looking at those who have come before you, you neglect the community around you.  And by that, I mean, for example, when people go to, like their school, when they look at African-American history, they start to go back to George Washington Carver, and they go to Martin Luther King or Malcolm X, and you go, "But that, if you're always going to those who have died, then does that mean there's nobody current doing things?"  And it just makes, you know, you wonder, and those are the images in the African-American community.  When people portray African-Americans, they always go back to those who have died, and they don't look at what's currently being done, and the phenomenal work by African-Americans today, and how African-Americans can leverage from each other to do spectacular things.  So, I'm always, like with my children, I'm always trying to expose them to African-Americans today.  So, when we had the Diversity Resource Workshop, we had Freeman Hrabowski, who's the president of UNBC who started the Meyerhoff Scholars Program at UNBC.  And so, I took my daughter with me to the workshop, and she introduced Freeman Hrabowski.  And now they're e-mail buddies, and she calls him Doc.  And I'm going, "That's President Hrabowski."  And he's like, "No, she can call me Doc."  And so, I want her to see, and go to her friends and say, "Hey there's Doc, you know, Doctor Freeman Hrabowski, who's doing these great things now that we can all participate in."  And we can do things together.  At the workshop, there's this organization that's in L.A. called Black Girls' Code.  And so, I had my daughter--and I, you know, and I went to her, and I was like "Jasmine, what would be a good application?"  And so, she likes cheerleading.  I go, "What about if you and your friends wrote an application to develop a new cheer, and you had to program in the angles, and you could see the cheerleader over time do these cheers, and figure out if that's what you want, and have music to the background."  Then she was like, "Ooh" and I go "Ahhh."  So, I was talking with the person who leads up Black Girls' Code, you know, because she's been going around to different cities to start these groups with the Black Girls' Code.  And unfortunately, Houston is not on the agenda currently, but we've been talking about what are some things that could be done?  Because she's developed, you know, a program to help get girls engaged and how to leverage from that.  And there's a program called Uplift in D.C. that looks at bringing in the minority community with math and looking at coding issues and looking at developing mobile apps.  So, it's all these things that are going now that you can leverage from, and I guess that's what I mean, is us knowing about what's going on now, understanding our current heritage as well as our past heritage, but not neglecting the current.  Because we can really build wonderful things.  You know, I have a friend in Chicago who started a company called Wisdom Group that he started back in the late '90's [1990s].  And so, and it's doing well.  It's a software group.  And so, you know, that's something great that's going on.  And he has a conference, Windy City Rails, and it's all of this working together that we can do great things.  And if we look around and see what each other's doing, the sky is limit as to what can be done in the African-American community.  We can use technology, you know, to look at issues about helping, looking at different under-served communities and helping under-served communities.  So, part of this workshop was saying that even though the schools in the under-served communities have dilapidated computers, the students have mobile devices.  How to use those mobile devices to complement what they're learning in school, and to better engage the student in math.  Maybe if those mobile devices or those applications had more cultural components--what if the applications had people that look like you and me, doing things that I'm familiar with--that would be wonderful.  And so, you know, I think that's the part of the challenge, but I think the great aspiration in terms of the African-American community.
Story_ID: 23359
Speaker 1: Okay.  When you look back on everything you've done at this point, what today would you consider to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: I would say two things, okay. (laughter). And maybe that's the Gemini in me (laughter).  That would be the research that I'm doing with the performance analysis, and also the work that we're doing together with Command It, I think would be the two things.  Because Command It, we're looking there to bring the community together, you know.  It's to say you still need organizations with African-Americans, Native Americans, Hispanics, people with disabilities.  But when we have some activities that bring us together, in terms of the population, we represent about 57 percent of the population projection in 2050.  So, together we represent a strong voice.  And what if we had some common issues that we've said, this is important to our community with regards to a cultural component, and bring those issues to the forefront as a joint community.  And so, I think Command It, and also the research, would be the two.  And I would say on the personal side, it's my children.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, when you look back at everything you've done to this point in life, is there any major thing that you would go back and change and do differently?
Speaker 2: No.  You know, you think about--and I go, I'm happy with where I am at this point in my life, and there's nothing I would do differently, because I don't think I would be at this point if I did.  And so, I just take each point--and I think it goes back to something my father said, "Pursue what makes you happy, not what makes other people happy."  And so, I do that, and I do that also with my children because they're, you know, a very important part of my life.  And so, it's nothing I would do differently with my children or with my life.
Story_ID: 23360
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, you have like, is it two or three?  Is it two children?
Speaker 2: I have two.
Speaker 1: Two, okay, two, alright.
Speaker 2: I have my son Theodore who's fifteen, and starting to drive.  That's a new experience. (laughter).  And my daughter who's twelve, so she'll be thirteen in November.  And my son will be sixteen in October, which means a driver's license in October.
Speaker 1: Now, are they leaning towards becoming engineers or scientists?
Speaker 2: At this point in time, my daughter enjoys dance, and my son enjoys music.  So, I'm going to leave it at that.  But we do look up about jobs and the pay scales for different jobs.  And we talk about how much it takes to have a good standard of living.  So, we look at those issues so that we're making informed decisions.  But they both excel in math and science, which I'm happy about.
Speaker 1: Okay, alright.
Speaker 2: So, we do have a focus on math and science in the house.  And they laugh, and they go "Oh Mom, everything's a math problem, isn't it?"  "Yes, it's all around us, come on." (laughter). "Everything's math, even down to a recipe, ratios." "Okay, what if we want to scale this down?"  And they laugh, "Oh my God, it's another math problem." (laughter).
Speaker 1: Well, I know your parents are proud of you.  I just talked to them yesterday.
Speaker 2: (laughter).
Speaker 1: The other question we always ask--they seem fairly proud of you and your siblings, you know.
Speaker 2: Yes, I think they're proud of all three of us, because we look at all three of us as a family.  So, what happens with one sibling, we're all there for each other. So, I can say, you know, my family's been supportive in all of my endeavors.  Sometimes they wonder about an endeavor, but they're still very supportive. (laughter).  And it's the same with the siblings.  And so, we talk with each other often, we visit each other often.  I wish we were closer.  I think, you know, when you go back, that would be the one thing, is that we were closer geographically, because then the kids could be around their cousins.  Because that experience of being around your cousin, it's just a different experience when, you know, you're around family.  It's a safety net that can't compare.  And having that safety net, when you have that broad family safety net, it's really comforting.  So, when I go to Chicago, I have a large family in Chicago, and you have a lot of cousins, and everybody's still, "Baby do you want some cake?"  And I go, "Honey, I need to fit my pants."  "But, oh, Baby go ahead and have some cake.  Here, I cooked this for you, I've made this for you, we have this for you."  So, that still goes on today when you visit family.  And I do that too, when family comes here to College Station, even though most of the times, we usually meet them in Houston. (laughter).
Story_ID: 23361
Speaker 1: Now, is there anything I haven't asked you that we need to talk about before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: Okay.  And let me just think, because we went through a lot.  I didn't realize you go through so much.  I guess one question, but no, because we talked about the department head here.  And I don't think I need to say any more about my personal life, because that, I think I said I'm divorced.  The only question is do I need to, should I say something about being a single mom?
Speaker 1: Oh yes.  How do you manage being a single mom?
Speaker 2: Okay, so I, you know, because I've been divorced now for over three years.  And so, as a single mom, the good part is that their Dad is here, he's still here.  And so, we alternate weekends.  But on a general basis, it's the help from my parents, so family.  I go back, again, to family.  So, my parents are a very big help, especially when I was department head, in terms of the children being picked up from school, and homework.  And we all have the same policy about homework.  So, during the week, it's not where we're looking at TV, it's homework.  But you can do things like read books and play your musical instrument, and things like that.  But you take each day as it comes, and the kids are very helpful.  So, Theo and Jasmine help a great deal around the house.  But you do learn to manage your time, and I think I've become more efficient as a single mom, and you prioritize.  So, my priorities are my children.  So, even as a department head, people were aware that I didn't go out to dinner with visitors, because that was my time in the evening to work with the kids and get their homework done.  The only time I did have was when it was a banquet or something like that, and then my parents would come by the house.  But otherwise, when it was a visitor, I would usually take the visitor out to breakfast.  We would meet for breakfast after the kids were dropped off to school.  So, you manage things based upon their schedule.  And we talk often about things, and we, you know, my children, we also talk about relationships.  So, they understand positive relationships, what you do, and you manage--and I think especially as a single mom with a son, you manage that, because you want him to have positive role models, because that's not in your home as a single mom.  Yes, so you make certain--like he has a very strong relationship with his grandfather, and he still has and maintains a very positive relationship with his dad.  So, we discuss that, to have a positive relationship there.
Story_ID: 23362
Speaker 1: Ma'am, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: Okay.  I would like to be remembered as a positive mother for my children, Theo and Jasmine, that I raised two very successful children.  And I'm not going to say what their discipline they're in, but they're very successful in terms of their career choices, that they're happy with.  They're successful in terms of giving back to the community, that they also value that, and they also value family.  And I would like to be remembered as a great sister to my brother and sister, and a great daughter to my parents.  So, it's really about the family aspect.  That's the most important part for me, is the family.  I think without that, I don't know where I would be.  So, I would say the family would be the first.  And then secondary, you can say your career with research and outreach, but it's really being remembered by the family.
