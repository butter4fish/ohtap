Speaker 1: My name is Thomas Jefferson and I'm an interviewer with The HistoryMakers.  Matthew Hickey is our videographer and Alla Hoffman is our observer.  Please state your and spell your name, including your middle name.
Speaker 2: [HistoryMaker] Ertharin Cousin, E-R-T-H-A-R-I-N, last name's Cousin, C-O-U-S-I-N with no middle name.
Speaker 1: Okay, your date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Date of birth is May 12, 1957, place of birth Chicago, Illinois, at Cook County Hospital [John H. Stroger Jr. Hospital of Cook County] (laughter).
Speaker 1: And today's date?
Speaker 2: Today is July 30, nine, 2010, and it's Friday.
Speaker 1: Yeah great.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Now location of this interview?
Speaker 2: 1900 South Michigan Avenue in Chicago, Illinois.
Speaker 1: Okay, tell us what your occupation is today.
Speaker 2: Today I serve as the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations organizations in Rome [Italy]; those organizations are primarily related to food and agriculture.  Or what we call hunger relief, food security, prevention of hunger for the bottom billion in this--in the global community.  We basically represent six UN agencies in Rome, the Food and Agriculture Organization, the World Food Programme, the International Fund for Agricultural Development.  The International Development Law Organization, UNIDROIT, which is a French name for the private law organization [International Institute for the Unification of Private Law] and ICCROM, International Council for the Preservation and Restoration for Cultural Property [sic. International Centre for the Study of the Preservation and Restoration of Cultural Property].
Speaker 1: And do you have to keep up with all those acronyms?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Actually when this is a presidential appointment with [U.S.] Senate confirmation and as part of my Senate pro- my, my preparation for the Senate hearing you learn all those acronyms.  But you, they do become part of your lexicon because we work with them on a daily basis.
Story_ID: 639037
Speaker 1: I'm gonna ask you some what we call People magazine questions, it just kind take a yes or no answer.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: What is your favorite food?
Speaker 2: Yes or no? (Laughter) My--
Speaker 1: Well--
Speaker 2: --my favorite food oh my, that's difficult. Anything sweet (laughter).
Speaker 1: Oh, okay, and what's your favorite time of year?
Speaker 2: Yeah see these are difficult questions, because it depends on where I am at that particular time of the year.  I love summer in Chicago [Illinois], I hate, I love winter in Rome [Italy] now, and so winter was never my favorite time of year in the City of Chicago.  So as you travel the world, you learn that different times of year will have different positives and negatives about them.
Speaker 1: So your favorite food hasn't changed since you've been in Rome?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I still have I, I'm now that I live in Rome my goal is to see how many different types of tiramisu I can eat (laughter).
Speaker 1: What is your favorite color?
Speaker 2: Favorite color, probably purple.
Speaker 1: Okay, and your favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Again that's tough va- vacation destinations I always say I haven't had my favorite des- vacation destination because there's so many fabulous places to see in the world. I had the opportunity while traveling in Sub-Saharan Africa to go to Victoria Falls.  And that was one of the most beautiful places that I'd ever been to, but then moving to Italy; I went and took a simple day trip down to Positano [Italy].  Which is the, it's the bluest water I've ever seen with reflected off the mountains and the houses.  So it again there this is--we're very, very blessed to live on an earth that we haven't completely destroyed.  And there's so, so many wonderful places to see.
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Favorite phrase, probably keep moving forward.
Story_ID: 639038
Speaker 1: Now I wanna get a little bit into your family background.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Tell us about your mother.
Speaker 2: My mother, Annie Kate Harris [Annie Harris Cousin], marries to Julius Cousin who is now of course Annie Kate Cousin.  Grew up in Washington, Georgia, attended Paine College [Augusta, Georgia], moved to Chicago [Illinois] when she left Paine College to much like many young women in the 1950s who moved from the South to the North.  She moved in with the old aunts, and she lived with the old aunts on what was then South Park Boulevard [sic. South Parkway; Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Drive].  And met my dad, married him, she served as a first a nurse then a social worker for the City of Chicago, until she retired.  She retired from the City of Chicago as the head of the senior services program for the City of Chicago.  She was not just a social worker by employment, but a social worker by, by, by heart.  We were the house that always had extra balls and bats and people knew we lived in on, in Lawndale [Chicago, Illinois].  That you could come and sign out a bat and a ball at any time, and the only thing you had to do was bring it back.  Because she was committed to not just raising her children but being part of the community.  She and my father believed that you could not work and believe that our, our community could move forward and live someplace else.  So as other people moved from Lawndale from the West Side [Chicago, Illinois] out to Maywood [Illinois] and Bellwood [Illinois], we stayed put.  Because they believed that they were committed to that community, and in order for the community to move forth, they stayed there with their four darling daughters.  She grew up as I said in Washington, Georgia, my grandfather; her father and mother were sharecroppers.  She grew up with them picking cotton in the fields in Washington, Georgia.  And, but they knew that she was the oldest of their four children, and they said she was the smart one.  And so while they picked cotton, she sat under a tree and read a book, because they wanted something better for her.  And she had that same spirit about us, she knew that the way to continue to move our community forward, our family for, forward was by educating her children.  And even when they couldn't afford it, we went to Catholic schools.  And because her parents had invested in her that way by letting her not pick cotton, and she knew that investing in us, that we would move forward.  And so we all went to Catholic schools and then on to college and, so it's, it's--I, I'm very blessed to have someone as a mother who believed that we can do anything.
Speaker 1: All right, now what do you know about her mother and father?
Speaker 2: As I was saying her mother and father were extremely religious. They were people who were sharecroppers.  Well, I should not call them sharecroppers, she does not like that word, oh my goodness.  They were plantation workers, they were no farm workers let's (laughter) that's the, that's the word she likes me to use farm workers.  They were farm workers that went on to do something better, something different.  They started off living on what was then a plantation, when she was young; she remembers living on a plantation.  When I visited her, when I visited my grandparents when I was very, very young, I have very early memories of going down a very long road.  And there was a big house and they had a little house in the background that had outhouse behind it.  But they as they got older, my grandfather went to work at the mill.  And my grandmother did, worked in, in the house cooking; cleaning at for the, the family who owned the land that they lived on.  Until they could acquire enough income to buy the land, and so they bought their house and the property on which the house was located.  And that that's, that's the kind of people that they were, they were the kind of people that believed that your circumstances did not determine your future.  And that only you and prayer and God can determine that and that if you worked hard enough that there, you could make life very different.  And they not only did it for themselves but for their children.
Speaker 1: What were their names?
Speaker 2: Arch Harris [ph.] and Katie Mae Harris [Katie Butler Harris].
Story_ID: 639039
Speaker 1: When did your mother [Annie Harris Cousin] come to Chicago [Illinois] what year, do you remember what year that was?
Speaker 2: Year my mom came, see I was born in 1957, so probably 1954.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Nineteen fifty-four [1954], 1955.
Speaker 1: Did your mother ever share with you any stories about your family history beyond your grandparents?
Speaker 2: Yes, but the stories about my family history be, before we go beyond my grandparents, I love to tell stories about my grandfather. Her father was a man as I said who believed in faith, family and hard work, and he was the deacon of their church.  He was the person, the re- the reason he was able to move from being a farm worker to working in the mill was because people in the community, whether they were Negroes in the community or the whites who living in the community, believed that he was a man who could be trusted and was part of the fabric of their, of, of their, of a black life in, in, in that, in Washington, Georgia.  And a good story to, to really illustrate his character is one that she tells often about when she was a young girl.  And there had been a jailbreak and allegedly three and we weren't even--three colored men had escaped from jail.  And they were, they had they were white men in pickup trucks who were going from house to house in the black neighborhood.  Knocking on doors, going through houses, turning over beds looking for these three escaped convicts.  And he lived in the house, by this time he, they, they had this house where he was living with his family, and he went and got a shotgun.  And sat it next to the door, and she said he opened the front door when he heard them coming, but latched the screen door.  And when they came upon the porch they, they, one of the men said, "Arch, now we coming in there.  We coming in there because you know we gotta look for these boys." And he said, "No, sir," he said, "there's nobody in here but my wife [Katie Butler Harris] and my children, and my wife is in bed."  And he said, "Naw, Arch now you know we, we, we gonna have to come up in there," and they said the sheriff was still sitting out in the car.  And they said, one of the, the men yelled back from the, from the porch and said, "This boy's not gonna let us in his house. He said his wife's in bed.  And he not letting us in here." The next thing, the sheriff yelled up, "Who is it," and he said, "It's Arch, Arch Harris [ph.]."  And the sheriff said, "Oh ain't nobody in Arch's house. Y'all come on. Let's go to the next house," (laughter).  And they knew that that he was somebody who was in the community that was just trying to protect his family, but he knew that he was prepared to that, die that night rather than let them come into the house with his wife and children.
Speaker 1: So he was well respected by whites and blacks there (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) By whites and blacks.
Story_ID: 639040
Speaker 1: Now you mentioned that your mother [Annie Harris Cousin] had some siblings.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Could you tell us who they were, and (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) She had--there were five children. She's the oldest of the five children.  She has two brothers Jimmie Harris [ph.] and Arch Harris, Jr. [ph.], and they both now live back in Washington, Georgia.  She had two sisters, Bessie Harris [ph.] and Jeanette Harris [ph.]. Jeanette's her baby sister who died many, many years ago.  And her sister, Bessie, still lives here in Chicago [Illinois] with her.  The interesting thing about her siblings were that they, none of them went to college.  And they, they did find factory work, but it, it--you would not--we, we're the kind of family where it did not matter what you did for a living, you were still a member of this family.  And they, we, we celebrate every success, whether a success of promotion at the factory or one of the grandchildren becoming an ambassador to the U.S., to the United States or for the United States.  And so it's, it is my son [Maurice Cousin] calls us very often, he says we're the black Waltons, becau- and that's my mother and her family are the base of that.  Because it, it the closeness of the family whether we are all in Chicago or they're in Washington, Georgia.  She still talks to them every week. At one point in my childhood they all lived within walking distance of my house.  And we had dinners together on Sunday, because she rar- her--she was raised by her parents.  Her--she and her siblings were raised by her parents just as she raised my sisters and I, and that is that nothing comes between you and your siblings.
Speaker 1: So it was a very tightknit family.
Speaker 2: It was a very tightknit family.
Speaker 1: Do you know anybody beyond your grandparents?
Speaker 2: Yes I do, my mother, my grandmother [Katie Butler Harris] had, she's from the Butler family, and they're from South Carolina.  And she has a, a number of sisters and brothers that we're not very close to.  But they, it's, it's, it's typical where you have a, a nuclear family that you're very close to, and the other parts of your family you see at weddings and funerals.  And so--but the, the, the side of the family that I know more about of course is, is her father's family.  And her grand- my grandfather [sic. great-grandfather] who is Arch Harris [ph.], as well was, was the matriarch--was the patriarch of the family for a very long time.  My mother likes to say he was a very mean man, but in, in during that period if you think about when he lived, the, there was, there was not a lot of laughter that he brought to a family.  He was very focused on ensuring that there was food on the table, and that came from hard work.  And, and I, I can't even imagine the kind of, of life that he lived in order to raise the kind of man that he did with my grandfather, Arch Harris.  But then, because they, they lived in, they were, they were truly farm workers. He was born a farm worker and died that way.  And from that existence though he--his, his, his children were taught faith and family and hard work.  And he as, as my mother likes to say he had a, had a, at least two wives.  He was one of these men who would marry and, and work the woman hard and when they died, he married somebody else (laughter).  Because you needed a woman in the house, because that was during the period when of course a man would not consider standing over a stove and cooking for children, but children always had to eat.  And, but, and, and, and he made my grandfather the man he was not just because he gave him the sense of faith.  But he also gave him the sense of family, but because he was so strict and stern, my grandfather was so much more loving.
Speaker 1: Now you got to tell me where is Washington, Georgia?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Washington, Georgia is southeast of Atlanta [Georgia]; it is probably eighty-five miles, ninety miles outside of Atlanta.
Speaker 1: What county is it in?
Speaker 2: It's in Wilkes County [Georgia].
Story_ID: 639041
Speaker 1: Tell us a little bit about your father.
Speaker 2: Julius Cousin. Julius Cousin was born in Franklinton, Louisiana [sic.]. He was one of two children.  His father died when he was very young from what did he--okay, he died when he was very young, and I will think about what he died from because that's important as to who he is.  It helped define who he was because my grandmother was the kind of person who was determined that she was never going to live poor.  And so she married very young, she had two children and when my grandfather died, she led a very interesting life after that in order to support those two children.
Speaker 1: And what was her name? This is their (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Carolyn Harris [ph.], okay.
Speaker 1: This is the grandmother on your father's side?
Speaker 2: On my father's side, this is my father's mother; Carolyn [Carolyn Brown Harris (ph.)] and Paul were married in that, those are my father's parents.  Paul Cousin and, and I say Cousin he was, as I said was born in Bogalusa [Louisiana], grew up in Franklinton and Lacombe, Louisiana which means that our name is not really Cousin it is actually (pronunciation) Cousin (laughter).  And so whenever I'm in Louisiana people say you know your name is not Cousin, because there are many, many Cousins in, in New Orleans [Louisiana], in the New Orleans area.  And it's spelled C-O-U-S-I-N, but they definitely pronounce it Cousin.  And when, after Paul died, my father went on to graduate from high school, which was a very big deal down in the bayou, outside of New Orleans.  But he did it as he said because he was committed again to a different kind of life.
Speaker 1: Now what did your grandfather do, what kind of work did he do?
Speaker 2: My grandfather on my father (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) On your father's side.
Speaker 2: I don't really know because he passed away when my father was probably three or four years old.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 639042
Speaker 1: And how about your grandmother on your father's side?
Speaker 2: My grandmother did everything that you, we could write a book about my grandmother.  My grandmother, Carolyn Harris [ph.], Carolyn Thompson [ph.], Carolyn Brown [Carolyn Brown Harris (ph.)], my grandmother was married four times.  To, as Paul [Paul Cousin] was her first husband, she was born Carolyn Brown, she grew up in a family of very, very poor family in Bogalusa [Louisiana], Franklinton [Louisiana] again working on farms down in that area.  And she will tell you that they lived a very hard, hard life, unlike my father's [Julius Cousin] family, my mother's [Annie Harris Cousin] family.  The life she grew up with was a lot less joy as a child, she da- she did not have the kind of childhood memories that my grandmother [Katie Butler Harris] and grandfather [Arch Harris (ph.)] on my father's side had.  The one story that she would tell us as a, about her childhood was they would go to church.  And unlike my mother's family, where they go to church and they had Sunday church clothes, she didn't, they didn't have Sunday church clothes.  They had one set of clothes and that was what they had on their backs.  That was what they worked in, it was what they, they didn't really go to school, and they washed them, and they go to church on Sunday.  And she says she remembers one Sunday morning being in a long line with her mother and father [Henry Brown (ph.)] and going to church and them saying to her.  And her seeing a woman dressed in a red dress, tight with long red gloves and high, high red heels and very sheer stockings.  And she said, "Who is that pretty lady?" She said, "I was about eleven or twelve years old and I was thinking oh my gosh, how can anybody be that pretty, and have clothes that are that pretty?"  And her mother said, "Don't look at her, that's the bad lady."  Because of course it was early Sunday morning; this was the prostitute coming back in early Sunday morning.  And she said she looked at her and said, "If that's the bad lady, and the bad lady gets to dress like that I want to be the bad lady," (laughter).  And my grandmother was that kind of flamboyant personality all of her life.  After my grandfather passed away, my grandmother ran alcohol from the stills in the bayou into New Orleans [Louisiana].  And how she got the alcohol in, she had a special relationship with the sheriff on the bridge.  My grandmother drove a yellow fishtail convertible Cadillac in 1955, fift- in the, in the mid-1950s.  And she was, she was a pretty fair skinned woman from Louisiana, and with all that that meant and during that period.  She ran the dice house down in, in her small town, and that was how she paid for my father to go on to high school.  And she went out to California to play cards and make money, she and then she, when she moved to Chicago [Illinois] she moved to Chicago to open businesses.  I re- my grandmother always owned something, whether it was the corner restaurant or the corner tavern or.  And she and her, her cousins they were the entrepreneurs on and when I grew up on the West Side [Chicago, Illinois].  My grandmother, my aunt had Madge's Place [ph.] on the West Side until she was too old and, and with Alzheimer's, and she couldn't run it anymore.  That, they were survivors, they were people who you know they she, she what, what was the hustle?  That was how she got it done.  You know just as my mother's parents believed you did it through education, my, my grandmother believed you did it anyway you could.  But the, the good part about it was that I mean when I say she did, she used, she said you do it anyway you could, she also knew that she could do something more for her child than what she had, which was why it was so important for her that my father graduate from high school.
Story_ID: 639043
Speaker 1: And he [Cousin's father, Julius Cousin] did and he, but he got married very early, he got married to, he had one wife before he married my mother [Annie Harris Cousin].  He married a woman in Fron- in Franklinton; he married his high school sweetheart from Franklinton, Louisiana.  And with her he had four children, five children and then he moved up to Chicago [Illinois] to do better.  He moved to Chicago he was part of the whole South Side of the City of Chicago, hanging out with the graduates of DuSable High School [Chicago, Illinois]  the, at, at the different clubs on the South Side. He wanted to be a policeman.  He had flatfeet, couldn't be a policeman; went to, he went to Washburne Trade School [Chicago, Illinois] and became a cook and a chef.  And the, divorced the wife down in Louisiana, married my mother (laughter) and, and that's, that's my grandfa- my grandmother [Carolyn Brown Harris (ph.)]. The interesting thing about my grandmother and, and how I, talked about how she raised my father but in, how she was very different with him.  She was even more different with us.  With us it was about times have changed and there's so much opportunity available for you.  And she was so pleased that my father married that pretty, dark, smart woman (laughter).  And had those smart, smart girls, and that we all went to Catholic schools, and she took such pride in every single one of our educational achievements.  Because that was so far beyond anything she could ever of dream or imagined.
Speaker 2: Now did your grandmother ever talk about her parents? Did they go back to slavery times, did they ever mention that?
Speaker 1: You know the, yes they did, did she talk about it no, no.  You know we, we know all about Henry Brown [ph.] and I will admit my sister probably knows the st- those stories much better than I do.  But my grandmother was not very much to talk about things that she wasn't very happy about.  And as I said, she had a very, very tough childhood.
Speaker 2: Now you mentioned that your father had a, a sibling?
Speaker 1: Yes, Major Cousin. My father's brother was his baby brother who was, when I remember when I was a kid thought he was the biggest man in the world 'cause he was probably 6'3''. He was someone who worked very hard. Unfortunately, he died of alcoholism when I was in college [University of Illinois at Chicago Circle; University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, Illinois].  And he was a man who loved his children and his nieces and nephews, and he was also the person who you knew on a Friday night when he came home there was always a quarter for you.  And he was the person who'd always say, "Dance for me baby and I'll give you a quarter."  And so you have those kind of joyous memories of someone and the pictures that we have of him are always of someone who was smiling and laughing and happy.  But he was a man who dealt with a lot demons and the worse of them was alcoholism.
Speaker 2: Did he come to Chicago when your father came?
Speaker 1: Came to Chicago after my dad did, yes.
Speaker 2: Okay, and what year did your father come to Chicago?
Speaker 1: He probably--let's see, probably 1952, '53 [1953].
Story_ID: 639044
Speaker 1: How did your mother [Annie Harris Cousin] and father [Julius Cousin] meet?
Speaker 2: Great story, as I said, my mother was living with the old aunts on South Park Boulevard [sic. South Parkway; Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Drive].  And my dad, my mother was the southern girl, I, from Washington, Georgia, Paine College [Augusta, Georgia].  Paine College is an all women's historically black college [HBCU].  And th- they put her on a train to send her with the old aunts to live with, with, what to us the old aunts.  And she was sitting in the window on a Saturday morning and she said my father was outside washing his car, and he didn't have his shirt on.  He was the prettiest thing she had ever seen in her life (laughter) and he will tell the story slightly differently.  He says she was the big legged, big fine woman and he could not get up the nerve to ask her out.  And they, he, he said he remembers taking her out and she had never had alcohol and never been in no, never been in a bar.  And, and took her out dancing and it was kind of kismet from there.
Story_ID: 639045
Speaker 1: And we're talking about your, your mother [Annie Harris Cousin] and father [Julius Cousin].
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And your grandparents, which do you, take after, who you think you're the most like your mother or your father?
Speaker 2: My goodness I look like my mother and I've been told that all my life, "You look exactly like your mother."  I have eyes like my father, which neither one of us could play poker or tell lies, because our eyes get big when we do (laughter).  And I have, I've been told that very often and much to my chagrin that I have my father's temperament.  My father was always very vibrant and very spontaneous and, and my mother's much more reserved and thoughtful.  I, I, and so I'd like to think that I'm more like her, but I, I think the reality is I'm probably much more like my father (laughter).
Story_ID: 639046
Speaker 1: Let's talk a little bit about your early childhood.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: What's your earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: Interesting, the earliest childhood memory is probably traveling in the back of my father's car as a, as a, a small you know three, four year old.  My dad was and, and, and my Aunt Mary [ph.] was living with us at the time.  And, and they would pick me up and take me places because my mom [Annie Harris Cousin] worked, and so it was easier, my father [Julius Cousin] worked at restaurants.  And so he would be home during the day and he'd pick me up and take me to my Aunt Mary's house.  And there was always you know getting in dad's great big car and riding with my dad, and so that was a very, very memory as a child.  Probably another one is, is you know playing with, I have, I have, I have three siblings and but my sister Tybra's [Tybra Cousin Arthur] eleven months younger than me.  And which means that we grew up pretty much like twins, so my earliest memories are always playing with her, and that they involved her.  And great part about it is that I live in Rome [Italy] now, she lives in Paris [France] (laughter) and so our lives continue to intersect.
Speaker 1: What were some of the family events that you remember that were really special to you?
Speaker 2: I, the, I had a great childhood; we grew up in Lawndale, in, in on the heart of the West Side of the City of Chicago [Illinois].  During a period of time before people moved out to the suburbs when you know when moving from South Park [South Parkway; Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Drive] to buying a house on the West Side was moving up.  Before people knew that there, that you could move to the suburbs you moved into, moving into just new communities.  So having a yard and where we played outside celebrating holidays have always been big in my family.  The first song any child in my family ever learned is 'Happy Birthday' because every single birthday is always celebrated, and we always celebrate them together.  And so you have these memories of always having my family around me having celebrations and a lot of laughter.
Speaker 1: What street did you live on?
Speaker 2: Lived on Polk Street at 3842 West Polk Street which is at Polk and Springfield [Avenue].  As I said its, it's in the Lawndale community and it is a community that by definition is in the heart of the inder- inner city.  And is considered one of the most underprivileged neighborhoods in the City of Chicago.  But from that street there have been doctors and lawyers and, and pilots who grew up in that neighborhood.  And what you hate seeing today is knowing that very few of the children who live on that street today will even finish high school.
Story_ID: 639047
Speaker 1: Just talk about, a little bit more about your family, name your siblings in their birth order.
Speaker 2: Okay, I'm the oldest, okay here is what I always say: how do you want me to name them? Do you want me to name the ones who grew up in the house with my mother, my sisters and I?  Or all of my siblings with my dad [Julius Cousin]? We'll name them all okay?
Speaker 1: Well let's start with the ones that grew in (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Grew up in the house with me, okay.  I'm the oldest of my mother and father's children.  And it's Ertharin [HistoryMaker Ertharin Cousin], Tybra [Tybra Cousin Arthur] is next and Tybra's eleven months younger than me, Yuvette [Yuvette Cousin Riley], Yuvette's the middle child with all the classic issues of being the middle child, and Zina [Zina Cousin] who's the baby.  Now what you will also notice is we are in alphabetical order, by birth order, with me as the oldest having the, my name begins with E and the baby's name beings Z.  We always say my mother's name is Anne [Annie Harris Cousin] and she was committed that her children would not have common names.  And so she spent lots of time thinking about how she would name her children.
Speaker 1: What was the age difference between your second, your--
Speaker 2: Third?
Speaker 1: The third child?
Speaker 2: Yuvette is three years younger than me, and so and she just turned fifty this year, and Zina's the baby she's ten years younger than I am.
Speaker 1: Okay, now you mentioned some other siblings.
Speaker 2: Yes my father as I said was, my mother was his second wife and we, I have five siblings from his first marriage.  Paul [Paul Cousin (ph.)] who's the oldest and Paul is probably twelve years older than me, twelve, thirteen almost fourteen years older than me.  Sheryl [Sheryl Cousin] who is two years younger than Paul and then Julius [Julius Cousin] who is five years older than me and Constance [Constance Cousin].  Constance is four years older than me, and Wanda [Wanda Cousin (ph.)] who is two years older than me.
Speaker 1: So did you interact with them?
Speaker 2: At one point we all lived in the same building (laughter) when at one point during my childhood as I said they grew up in Louisiana.  They were all living in Louisiana, and their mother moved to Chicago [Illinois] and we lived in a two flat.  My grandmother [Carolyn Brown Harris (ph.)] lived on the first floor, my father's mother, and we lived on the second floor, and they lived with my grandmother when they first moved to Chicago.  That didn't last very long and they moved to a house that was probably walking distance from us.  The, the tough part for them and, and, and as we look back on it now, we are probably closer now than we were growing up.  Because we had the father and we went to Catholic schools and they didn't.  And so I think that was tough for them and my youngest brother Julius, the youngest than the two but older than me, lived with us, during his child- most of his childhood.  And he's still closest to me of my siblings from the first marriage today. The good part about it is that we all still do come together for Christmas and, and other important family events.  The interesting part of it though that, even though we lived in the same house, we still call their mother Miss Freddie [ph.].  And they still call my mother Miss Anne (laughter) and so it was, it was, you, you still respected you know who's children was whom's.  And the, the--what we shared in common was the love of my dad.
Story_ID: 639048
Speaker 1: Now, you mentioned they lived near you, describe your, your block that you grew up on.
Speaker 2: My block, you, the, the, the, you can describe it in two ways, you can describe my block when I was younger, and my block as I grew older.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Because when, when I was very young the, you had the people who were buying houses who were working class African Americans.  Who were buying house on the West Side [Chicago, Illinois] and it was white flight. You had people moving out as fast as, as African American were buying houses.  And the people who were moving in, I remember at one point my third grade teacher lived across the street from me.  It was a, a block that peopled lived on; it was the block where you jumped double dutch in the street all day long in the summertime.  Where you played hide and go seek at nighttime and nobody worried about anybody running into, between the buildings in, in, in at night.  It was a block where my sister Tybra [Tybra Cousin Arthur] who was an athlete played, bounced the basketball and played basketball at, at the corner on, at the net which was at the grammar school at the corner [Presentation School, Chicago, Illinois].  As we got older, and integration provided opportunities for those who could to move out, they did.  And what you were left with like in too many of our communities were the people who couldn't afford to move someplace else.  Or people like my parents [Annie Harris Cousin and Julius Cousin] who believed that you had to stay in the community, keep the community rooted.  And so the block that my baby sister grew up on, Zina [Zina Cousin], who's ten years behind me, it's very different. Her memories of the block are very different than my memories of the block.  Because it was not someplace you played, because it was not someplace that was safe.
Story_ID: 639049
Speaker 1: Did you have other memories about growing up, what were the kind of smells and sounds of your--
Speaker 2: Growing up we grew up where (laughter) it, it's, it's it was a great, as I said a great block to grow up on, lots of kids.  When I was in grammar school, we attended Presentation Catholic school [Presentation School, Chicago, Illinois] which was at the corner of my block.  So we, we you lived in, in a three block area from the candy store, two blocks away to the, the grammar school.  It was the kind of block where the watermelon man came down the street in the summertime.   The ice cream man came down the street in the summertime.  If my sister were sitting here she'd say, "Tell him about Nana." Nana as I told you Nana was my father's mother [Carolyn Brown Harris (ph.)] who my father [Julius Cousin] was able to buy this house because he bought it with, with the help of my grandmother who lived on the first floor, we lived upstairs.  My grandmother was this person who was an entrepreneur she owned, as I say, she owned restaurants, she owned bars, and she made early entrepreneurs out of all of us.  She, we'd go to the candy store she'd say, "You don't need to go to the candy store; you need to sell the candy."  So she would take us to the warehouse and we would buy boxes of candy and sold candy on our porch.  And so if you sold enough candy, then you could eat it (laughter).  And so we had the porch that had all the kids, because it was the candy house, and anybody he grew up in, in inner city neighborhoods can tell you about the candy house.  It was the place that you went and you had a nickel and you got you know ten pieces of candy, 'cause they were two for a penny.  And so that's one of my earliest memories as a child is being you know nine, ten, eleven years old outside selling candy on our porch.  And had, always having money for the ice cream man, because we sold the candy.  So it was, it was very much though the place where children gathered, and, and I think about it now, they did that very purposefully.  It was also having four girls away that they kept us right there that they could see us, because everybody came to us.  And so they knew all of our friends because they were always on our porch, and they knew where we were because we were on the porch selling candy or we were standing in front of the porch jumping rope.  And it was the kind of block where everybody on that block knew whose children, who belonged to whom. They knew where you were supposed to be.  And they knew if your parents weren't at home that you weren't supposed to be someplace and you knew they knew.  And you knew that before your parents' first--their foot would hit the first step they would tell if you (laughter) weren't where you were supposed to be.  So it was very easy for us to stay on that porch because we knew we had lots of prying eyes if we didn't.  The interesting thing for me though during this period was if this was during the Civil Rights Movement in the City of, of Chicago [Illinois], as well just as it was in the South.  And if you remember this was the period that Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] came to the City of Chicago, and came to the West Side.  I remember Martin Luther King giving a speech on top of the hot dog stand, two blocks from my house, and the entire neighborhood going out to see him speak.  I remember the, the fire hydrants being on and shutting the fire hydrants 'cause out, we didn't have pools, neighborhood pools  so you'd turn the fire hydrant on in the summertime.  But turning the fire hydrant off and nobody complaining about it, because you went to see Martin Luther King speak on, on, on the corner.
Story_ID: 639050
Speaker 1: But during this same period when everyone was focused on Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] and, and what was happening on the West Side of the city as far as integration was concerned, I was a very strange child.  Because I read everything, I read encyclopedias as a kid that, you know we ordered encyclopedias they were books like any other books.  You, I didn't know you weren't supposed to just like get the letter M and read (laughter)it through.  And so I had this fascination with baby seals and this was during the Civil Rights Movement and I'm knocking on people's doors on the heart of Lawndale [Chicago, Illinois] asking them to sign my petition to save the baby Alaskan seals (laughter).  And people thought I was the strangest thing they had ever seen, because you know everybody's wearing Afros and you know, power to the people. I'm telling people but you got to save the baby seals.  And I wrote a letter to President Nixon [President Richard Milhous Nixon] at the bright early age of ten about the baby seals with my petitions attached that I had gotten signed on my (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You got somebody to sign them (laughter)?
Speaker 1: I got everybody on my block (laughter) to sign that petition to save the baby seals.  And we took the petition and sent it in and I got a letter back from, from, from President Nixon.  And it was the first time I was ever mentioned in a national magazine because they in, in if you're, if you remember Jet magazine did a column called People You Should Know [ph.].  And they talked about this little girl on the West Side of the City of Chicago [Illinois] who is fighting to save the baby seals.
Speaker 2: So what year was this?
Speaker 1: Oh my goodness exactly probably sixty (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Sixty-eight [1968] or something?
Speaker 1: No it wasn't even that late, probably like '63 [1963], '64 [1964] yeah, so I was odd, okay.  But it, it was, I, I've always it, it gives you an inkling of I would it was for me it was about what was right; it wasn't about what was popular.  And so it made me have my friends thought I was a bit strange, and so the kids in the neighborhood always thought that they, they, they--the way they always looked at my sisters and I, I should say this, was that yeah we were the kids who you always hung out on their block because we were girls and we were cute.  But we were also the ones that people knew they'd, people would say things like they talk white, because at my mother's [Annie Harris Cousin] house you always use correct, your sentence structure.  And you said, you, it wasn't were in the appropriate way, and you didn't say ain't and all of those things, and it meant something in that neighborhood that the Cousins girls were their friends.  Because parents liked that, though it was a working class, a lower income working class neighborhood that that these were girls that were different.
Story_ID: 639051
Speaker 1: But you had a certain amount of status in your neighborhood?
Speaker 2: We were Catholic school girls, okay (laughter); we were the Catholic school girls so we had a certain amount of status.  And wha- my sister [Tybra Cousin Arthur] will tell you she had status because she could play basketball better than most of the boys in the neighborhood [Lawndale, Chicago, Illinois].  But yeah, we did and, and, and as the neighborhood began to change that status became more about the fact as well, we also had a mother [Annie Harris Cousin] and father [Julius Cousin] who were both still there.  And that became more unusual as time went on.
Speaker 1: And tell us about we're gonna get into a little bit about your schooling. What was the name of the elementary you went to?
Speaker 2: Presentation [Presentation School, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Presentation that was a Catholic school?
Speaker 2: Yeah, but I didn't, I only went to Presentation from kindergarten to fifth grade. I was bused as part of the archdiocese busing program where they decided that if they took the smart kids out of the neighborhood and put them into Catholic schools in the suburbs that they could make our lives better.  And it's interesting because I was bused, my sister wasn't, the ones who's eleven months younger than me.  And--
Speaker 1: Where were you bused to?
Speaker 2: St. Louise de Marillac [St. Louise de Marillac School] in LaGrange Park [Illinois].
Speaker 1: LaGrange Park?
Speaker 2: Yes, every morning from seventh, from sixth grade through eighth grade.  And my sister said it made me very odd because you get, now I get, I still lived in a, a, a neighborhood that was continuing to grow poor, but I went to school in an upper middle class suburb.   And if you had thought I was different before (laughter) three years of that.  The good part about it, the, the, the sustaining factor through it was all was my family and my parents.
Speaker 1: Were there any black students at the school?
Speaker 2: There, when we first started the program when we were in, when I was in sixth grade, there were probably twenty-five of us. Only two finished.
Speaker 1: Were they all from your neighborhood?
Speaker 2: They were all from my grammar school, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We all came from same grammar school.
Story_ID: 639052
Speaker 1: Did you have any favorite teachers?
Speaker 2: In grammar school [Presentation School, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah lots of favorite teachers.  I, I should, should say that Presentation Catholic Church [Chicago, Illinois] was the home parish of Monsignor Egan [John J. Egan].  Father Egan who if you, if you had, if anyone who was involved in the Civil Rights Movement during that period knows who Monsignor Egan was.  Monsignor Egan marched with Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] and he was one of the activists in the City of Chicago [Illinois] who was very, who was responsible for bringing King to Chicago.  And was definitely instrumental in bringing him to the West Side, and was one reason why he was on top of the hot dog stand.  And Monsignor Egan was someone who was, who believed that the things that were being, that we talked about in the South, that they were just as much a problem in the North.  And particularly in neighborhoods like Lawndale [Chicago, Illinois] and was instrumental in creating the archdiocese busing program, to ensure that there were additional opportunities that were opened up.  So he was very, very influential in my life and life of my siblings, throughout, not just as a child, but right through my career.  And we spend a lot of time talking about that he was a, a, but I don't want to get too far off that.  But he, it was, it was during a period when if you were providing a good education for your children, you put them into Catholic school.  And you did that not just because Catholic schools were better than public schools, but because of the discipline in Catholic schools.  And the, the values that you wanted them to create, Father Egan was, was, was the epitome and the example why people during the 1950s and '60s [1960s] want their children to go to Catholic schools.  In the school itself and my grammar school, teachers in my grammar school.  My third grade teacher Miss Costello [ph.] who lived across from the street from us was someone who was not just instrumental in the classroom, but because she lived across from us.  She was instrumental in my life and in, and that's during a period of time when, when as I said, we were always different in, in.   But we weren't so different because she and her children were just the same.  And so we had a lot in common and, and share a lot.  Going to St. Louise de Marillac [St. Louise de Marillac School, LaGrange Park, Illinois], what was it, I, I can't think about one teacher, but the, the, the terrific opportunity that opened up for me in going to St. Louise de Marillac was that they had the resources to support the implementation of my ideas as a twelve year old child.  I would decide I want to do a play and they would say fine, you want to do a play, put it on.  And I could, they would give me the resources to build stages and have other children and their parents make costumes.  And to select the play myself and, and, and actually to produce a performance.  And so it was a time in my life when having people who said she's smart and different and there's how do we, how do we channel that?  And they did and it, it helped shaped me to understand that it's not enough just to have a good idea.  It's--there's a lot work that goes along with the good idea, and--
Story_ID: 639053
Speaker 1: So what were kind of your dreams and aspirations? Did you want to be a playwright (laughter)?
Speaker 2: Oh no I wanted to be an actress; I was going to Hollywood.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was gonna be a producer and an actress, yes I was.  If you had asked me back then theatre was my life and I was going to, if you this, this was also during the period of, of 'Julia.'  And so there was actually, there was actually a black woman on television [HistoryMaker Diahann Carroll], and so I can do that.  If she can do that I can do that.  But I was also believed that you had to be an activist, I remember organizing a protest outside the convent, at the age of twelve at St. Louise de Marillac [St. Louis de Marillac School, LaGrange Park, Illinois] because we wanted to wear pants under our uniform skirts in the wintertime (laughter) and so--
Speaker 1: That was important.
Speaker 2: It was very important, but they didn't think it was a good idea though, march people around in a circle all the, at the nun's convent (laughter) at lunchtime.  But it was, it was as I said, it was, I, I wanted to, to be to change things. I've that's, that's been the one constant.  Whether it was creating a play, being in theatre, leading a protest, getting signatures on, on petitions to save baby seals, it was always about what could we do to change things?  How do you take ideas and make them into realities?
Story_ID: 639054
Speaker 1: You went to a Catholic school.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Was your family Catholic or what?
Speaker 2: As my mother [Annie Harris Cousin] was Baptist, my father [Julius Cousin] was Baptist but they both embraced Catholicism because that was what you had to do in order for your children to attend Catholic schools during the 1960s.  We were all baptized Catholic, confirmed Catholic and none of us are practicing Catholics today.  Though I find that living in Rome [Italy] now, I actually attend Mass much more than I did pull- probably the past twenty years.  But my father was actually, his funeral was actually at a Catholic church, because right up until the time that he passed away he was very, very involved in the Catholic church.
Story_ID: 639055
Speaker 1: Now where did you go to high school?
Speaker 2: Lane Tech High [Albert Grannis Lane Technical High School; Lane Technical College Preparatory High School, Chicago, Illinois], I was in the first class of girls at Lane Tech High.  There's a theme here you see, I'm going (laughter) I read in the newspaper, I am this is, this is a true story.  I read a blurb in the newspaper that Lane Tech was going to allow girls to admit, to enter.  I said I can go there, and we were trying to decide on a high school for me and I tested to attend the Lab School.  And they offered me you had, the Lab School for the University of Chicago [University of Chicago Laboratory Schools, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: And they offered me a scholarship, but it was nowhere near enough money. My parents [Annie Harris Cousin and Julius Cousin] never could've afforded to send me to Lab School, but it was an interesting idea.  My father's thought was that I should go Alvernia [Alvernia High School], which was an all girls high school on the North Side of the City of Chicago [Illinois], and learn to type.  Because in his mind, I was smart, I spoke well and I could work in an office.  And because he couldn't see beyond me being a secretary that to him was as good as a black woman could do.  That you could work in an office downtown and you could take the train to work every day, and I, I remembered going and him registering me for high school at Alvernia and just crying in the car the entire way back.  I said, "I don't wanna learn to type," (laughter) I, I said, "I'll have people who'll type for me."  And he just thought that was just such a pipe dream. He couldn't, he, in his mind, he was doing what was best.  And so I role- enrolled myself at Lane Tech, with my mother's kind of blessing you know.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: You know and I, I you know took myself on the bus and went down and enrolled myself.  And I would, they had a, they gonna accept two hundred girls in the freshman class.  And the school had five thousand boys and twelve hundred girls in the fresh- twelve hundred students in the freshman class.  And they, for the first time they have two hundred girls in the freshman class and a hundred girls in the sophomore class, and I got accepted.
Speaker 1: Now was Lane Tech primarily white at that time?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah (laughter) oh yeah, it was probably 2 percent black at that point.  And if you remember the boundaries were Lane Tech's boundaries were Roosevelt Road to the south and the city limits on the north.  And then you had Lindblom [Robert Lindblom Technical High School; Robert Lindblom Math and Science Academy, Chicago, Illinois] whose boundaries picked up at Roosevelt Road on the north and went to the city limits on the south.  So that was the black technical school was Lindblom, and then you had the white technical school, which was Lane Tech.  So it was not only all boys, it was also all white, and I said, "So what?"  I was coming from Lane, I was coming from St. Louise de Marillac [St. Louis de Marillac School, LaGrange Park, Illinois] where I was one of two African Americans at that time black people in the, in the eighth grade class.  So that, the race issue was not an issue for me.  And so I enrolled myself and I got accepted and I went, and they sent truant officers to my house.  Because I was registered at Alvernia High School, and so they thought I just wasn't going to high school.  The, but by this time of course my mother and father had acquiesced to me going to Lane, and they explained to them that I'd gone to Lane Tech.
Story_ID: 639056
Speaker 1: Now you're at Lane Tech [Albert Grannis Lane Technical High School; Lane Technical College Preparatory High School, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 2: Um-hmUm-hm.
Speaker 1: Were there any particular teachers there that influenced you or that you, were kind of your favorite teacher?
Speaker 2: Oh gosh I had lots of favorite teachers at Lane Tech. Again, it was the kind of school where I was one of two hundred girls.  Probably one of twenty, not even that many, one of fifteen African American girls in the freshman class.  And so people knew who I was, I-- we, you know we were president of the, we, we started the girls cheerleading teams and pompom squads.  And, and, and you know the girls, girls athletic association, all of those things we got to not only start but be the president of.  Because we were the only girls and so the teachers, Miss Porter [ph.], who was a gym teacher there at the time, was really supportive of everything we wanted to do. Miss Hagen [ph.] who was my English teacher who, who really supported my love of reading and, and continued to push me.  I, when-- high school for me was interesting. I was, I was the, I was the, one of the cute girls in high school.  I was on the, as I said, on the pompom squad and come, on the homecoming court and on the, this that and the other thing.  So it was, it was a time where peers were probably more important to me than teachers.  And being popular when gram- was your average fourteen, fifteen, sixteen year old being popular was, was as important to me as making good grades.
Story_ID: 639057
Speaker 1: The, the reality of it was my parents [Annie Harris Cousin and Julius Cousin] during that period were at a loss (laughter).  Because we were involved in everything and we were very, well I say we, my sister was very different.  Tybra [Tybra Cousin Arthur] and I are eleven months apart we both in high school at the same time, I went to Lane Tech [Albert Grannis Lane Technical High School; Lane Technical College Preparatory High School, Chicago, Illinois], she went to Cathedral, to Holy Name Cathedral [Cathedral High School, Chicago, Illinois], so she went to Catholic school.  Tybra wanted to be a nun when we were in high school, and Tybra would go on religious retreats.  But she would also go to all the parties, and Tybra would tell me that I would get in trouble because I was loud (laughter).  And so (laughter) she said that she was doing the same things that I was doing, but she was much quieter about it.  And I didn't know how to be quiet about things.  And I felt, she said, "You always feel like you gotta tell--." She said, "I don't understand this. You are so verbal.  Why do you need to like share everything," and so my, my, my parents would laugh. My mother would tell you during this period between the time I was in junior high school out in, in LaGrange Park [Illinois] and going to Lane Tech, and Tybra was a black power--.  Tybra was also a junior [HistoryMaker] Angela Davis, while I was at St. Louise de Marillac [St. Louise de Marillac School, LaGrange Park, Illinois], my mother went and took and, and started working on a master's in, in child psychology.  Because she said (laughter) she had to try to understand all these things that we were going through.  And got very much into boys and but at the same time still had decent grades, and always tested off the charts.  And got pregnant when I was a senior in high school.  So when I graduated from high school, I was, let's see I graduated in June, I was eight months pregnant.  And when my son [Maurice Cousin] was born, I remember vividly the nurse in the recovery room saying, "Well this is one of those cute ones. She'll be back here again next year."  And because I was from the West Side [Chicago, Illinois] that was all that was expected, and for my parents that was the straw that said okay.  Somehow or another we lost control here. We need to figure out how to get her back again.   And I was, I was terribly in love and wanted to get married, and my mother said, "Do us one favor. We will help you.  Go to college for a year. If you still wanna get married you can do it with our blessing, just go to college for a year."
Speaker 2: And you're off to the University of Illinois [University of Illinois at Chicago Circle; University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 1: And that was all she wrote, it was like oh my god, there's this great big world out there, why in the world would anybody wanna get married?  So yeah, so, so high school was, was filled with all kinds of stuff.  That the good part about it is I didn't completely self-destruct during the period.  And, and you look at Tybra and I, as we came through this, and we are opposite mirrors of each other.  Tybra came through and was in Junior Achievement [Junior Achievement USA] and Tybra was always and she will say this.  She said that I was the smart one; she was the one who worked hard.  And so she ended up at Illinois Institute of Technology [Chicago, Illinois]; she tutored calculus when she was in college and in high school.  She played four years of girls basketball; I was on pompom squad.  You know I was the one who would drink too much and she'd sneak me in the house, and she will tell those stories to this day (laughter).  And but we pulled each other through and she will say that you know I was, I was bent on, on, on seeing how much rope I could actually pull around my neck without strangling myself.  And she said I was, she said, "And my job was to keep unloosing it," (laughter), "so you would be okay."
Speaker 2: You had kind of a wild side too.
Speaker 1: Oh yeah that is one way of putting it, that is one way of putting it. People would've said that.  But the, the interesting part about it was that I had a wild side on it, but I was still from the good girl family.  So you, there was only you know, you I look at a lot of my friends during that period who some of them aren't alive today.  And I was never gonna get that close to the edge, you know, I wanted be, to be over there and so did a lot of things. I made a lot of mistakes that I, that I coach young people against all the time now.  Because it's, it's--I always tell people as an adolescent you don't know what you don't know.  And so often we make mistakes because of the limited amount of knowledge that we have about what the world has to offer, and what our true potential actually is.  But the blessing that I had in my life again was having a family that said she's wild, she's crazy, hold her (laughter).  Try to keep her as close as we can, and I got through it.
Story_ID: 639058
Speaker 1: Now, what year did you graduate from high school [Albert Grannis Lane Technical High School; Lane Technical College Preparatory High School, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Nineteen seventy-five [1975].
Speaker 1: Okay now who helped raise your, your son?
Speaker 2: My parents [Annie Harris Cousin and Julius Cousin], my sister [Tybra Cousin Arthur], my friends, the neighbors, my [paternal] grandmother [Carolyn Brown Harris (ph.)] (laughter); he's a product of everybody.  I went to the University of Illinois [University of Illinois at Chicago Circle; University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, Illinois]. I'd gotten accepted everywhere.  You know I, as I said, was, was this trying to be out of control seventeen year old who continued to score off the charts on SAT, ACTs and had, had still made, was able to have decent grades, and got accepted everywhere.  But stayed here, went to University of Illinois at Circle.  My grandmother took care of my son during the day while I went to school. My freshman year of college at this point I'm determined that I'm gonna be completely different.  And I was working at the post office [U.S. Post Office Department; U.S. Postal Service] full-time and going to school full-time and taking care of my son.  And I did that for about a year and a half, and my parents said, "Okay, you know," (laughter), "enough.  You, you--we see you're committed; it's okay." So I quit the post office.  Was able to focus more on school and really student life you know and got to go to parties and do things that you do when you were in college, and made friends that I have for a lifetime today.  But I was only able to do that because they said okay and my mother took responsibilities for Maurice [Maurice Cousin] that, but for that I could not of had that kind of life.  My grandmother of course was always there. My son ate steak at the age of two because that was what my grandmother cooked for him to this day.  He's now thirty years old with gout (laughter) because he has had such a rich diet all of his life.  And has such unbelievably caviar taste. He and I got through four years of college.
Speaker 1: What was your major?
Speaker 2: Criminal justice with minor in political science.
Speaker 1: Were, was there a Black Student Union there at that time?
Speaker 2: There was a Black Student Union and I was involved, but not as involved because there was, it wasn't very strong.  I was probably more involved very honestly with frats and, and being a silhouette for the Sigmas [Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity] and you know hanging out in those ways when I had time as opposed to being in the Black Student Union.
Speaker 1: And what sorority were you in?
Speaker 2: Didn't, didn't pledge, I started pledging Delta [Delta Sigma Theta Sorority]. It was very interesting and too hard and in the sense that I was a single parent.  And in black fraternities and sororities that's still in 1975 was pretty much uncommon.  And I think that if I had been a person who was more committed to it, I would've let them do the things to me that they want to do to prove that I could still be a Delta or an AKA [Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority], but I wasn't.
Story_ID: 639059
Speaker 1: Now when you were at Circle [University of Illinois at Chicago Circle; University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, Illinois], was there a little bit of tension between the, the university and, and the neighborhood, I mean--
Speaker 2: By this time that was pretty much over.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: By '75 [1975], if you, when, when they first built Circle as you know, that was pretty much an Italian community.  That they moved a lot of--and by eminent domain--a lot of families out of there in order to build the university.  There, so that the tension with the university wasn't there as much. The tension with African Americans and the neighborhood was still there.  I remember trying to rent an apartment in the area with my son [Maurice Cousin] during my senior year of, of college.  And I just had the woman say to me this is not a safe neighborhood for you to live in with your child.  Because it still was not very accepting. It was still very much closed community, once you left the campus.
Speaker 1: Now on the West Side [Chicago, Illinois] probably, maybe a little bit earlier than this there were I think what, Reverend Shelvin Hall [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr. Shelvin Jerome Hall] was very much involved--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --in some of the things--
Speaker 2: Um-hm with Danny Davis [HistoryMaker Danny K. Davis]. I grew up with all, with particularly with Danny Davis sat at the dining room table with my father [Julius Cousin].  My father was instrumental and he was one of the founding members of, of Pyramidwest [Pyramidwest Development Corporation] on the West Side, Lawndale Christian action group [Lawndale People's Planning and Action Council] on the West Side.  He was on the founding board member for all of those; he was part of the progressive people's movement, fighting Richard Daley [Richard J. Daley] and the machine on Chicago's West Side.  And I remember Danny Davis drinking scotch with my father until their heads fell on the table, solving all the problems of our community.  There was the, the elections at that point if you were, if you remember the 1960s and '70s [1970s] in Chicago [Illinois] were pretty much controlled by the Democratic machine in Chicago.  And so for these young and they were forty year old black men, thirty and forty year old black men who were trying to take over politics on the West Side, they had all of us working for them.  I passed out literature on corners for years with Danny and Reverend Shelvin Hall and Mr. Duwill [ph.] and all these people who were committed to trying to, to change politics on the West Side.
Speaker 1: There was what Father Mallette [Dan Mallette] you remember him?
Speaker 2: I don't know him.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's too far west.
Speaker 1: Did, did you know Shelvin?
Speaker 2: I know Shelvin, but again that's you, the West Side, much like the South Side is broken into different communities. That's more Austin [Chicago, Illinois], I lived in Lawndale [Chicago, Illinois], okay?  So I didn't work with them as much, but Bethel New Life [Chicago, Illinois] and Mary Nelson and that whole group, I know all of them very well.  They were very, very much involved in the, the neighborhood where I lived in.
Speaker 1: What ward was that?
Speaker 2: Depend on which, which districting it was, they, we lived on a little strip of land that flips between the 24th, 28th, and 29th wards.  Because it's between Roosevelt Road and the expressway [Dan Ryan Expressway], and depending upon how you draw the line, it has been in each one of those wards sometime during my, my parents' residency in that area.
Speaker 1: Okay that would, probably when then probably primarily the 24th Ward?
Speaker 2: Primarily in the 24th Ward.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: It's in the 24th Ward right now, but it's for probably ten years it was in the 28th Ward and then it, it was actually in the 29th Ward.  'Cause Danny was our alderman for a while too.  But Bill Henry [William C. Henry] was our Alderman over--
Speaker 1: Bill Henry.
Speaker 2: --the 24th Ward yeah, Um-hm, and for a minute Ed Smith was our alderman.  So see I've known all of them and I, I remember when I first finished law school [University of Georgia School of Law, Athens, Georgia], Ed Smith would say, "Oh I remember when you wore pigtails."  I said, "Ed, I'm a lawyer now." You know (laughter) because the, the all of those, they all overlapped.  And, and they all worked together, not so much Bill Henry (laughter). Bill was in a different place.  And he was very much a part of; he's very much part of the Daley machine during that period, and Ed Smith and Danny were much more progressive.
Speaker 1: So you got a lot of your, I'd say political education with your father and some of these people?
Speaker 2: Oh very much so. Oh yeah, the, the commitment that we, that I have to politics as a tool for change comes from what I learned from them.  When, I didn't get a driver's license 'til I was twenty-six years old, but I got a voter registration card the day I turned eighteen.  'Cause that's one of the things that was always important to my father was that as soon as you were eighteen years old that he took you down and got your voter registration card.
Story_ID: 639060
Speaker 1: Okay now you're, you're at the University of Illinois [University of Illinois at Chicago Circle; University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, Illinois]; you graduate from there.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Now how does a girl from the West Side of Chicago [Illinois] (laughter) end up in Athens, Georgia at the University of Georgia [University of Georgia School of Law]?
Speaker 2: They offered me a three year scholarship, all expenses paid, I said, "Here I come y'all." Very honestly that's exactly what happened.  On the application process, it asks can we send your scores and your data to other schools, and I check the box yes.  And it went to University of Georgia, the University of Georgia was at that time--this was pre-Bakke [Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, 1978]--was under a court mandate to accept so many African American students every year.  And so they were doing outreach to African American students and I was one that they accepted and offered a three year scholarship to.
Speaker 1: When did you decide you wanted, you wanted to be a lawyer?
Speaker 2: The, my son's father's father was a lawyer. All of his friends were lawyers, and I got to spend a lot of time with them.  And I said this, and they were people who were committed to making change, but were doing it in a different way.  And so that seemed to me like something I wanted to pursue, not really completely understanding that the pa- at that time what it meant to study law (laughter).  But recognizing the value that lawyers provided to our community.
Speaker 1: Were there any particular lawyers in the area that influenced you and that you kind of looked up to then?
Speaker 2: At that point, I, as I said, it was, it was, it was Gary Cole [ph.] and Jim Hill [ph.]  and they were all young lawyers back then.  Big Afros you know helping the, the progressive party with from, from a legal standpoint in the City of Chicago.
Speaker 1: And okay now what year did you go to UGA?
Speaker 2: Seventy-nine [1979].
Speaker 1: Seventy-nine [1979].
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And there probably weren't a lot of black students in the law, I mean all the blacks were on the football team, I'm sure.
Speaker 2: There were, and basketball team, don't forget.
Speaker 1: And basketball team.
Speaker 2: No there were not.  The University of Georgia graduated its tenth--it's the oldest public law school in the country--and it graduated its tenth black student in about 1971, and so it was one of those schools in the South where for generations if you lived in Georgia and you qualified to--for admission into the University of Georgia, the state would pay for you go to go to Northwestern [Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois], University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois] or Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts], and there are lots lawyers down the Chi- in the South who were the generation ahead of us who will tell you that they applied to U, University of Georgia but instead got a scholarship to the University of Chicago.  And so and because they were under a court order at that point, they were accepting African American students.  And in my class we had the, I think we had probably fifteen students in my class, and we were from all around the country.  Not just from university, not from just the State of Georgia.
Story_ID: 639061
Speaker 1: I would imagine a big thing at, in Athens [Georgia] at that time was probably Herschel Walker?
Speaker 2: Herschel Walker came in during my sophomore year, or my second year at UGA [University of Georgia School of Law, Athens, Georgia]; he was a freshman during my second year.  I remember when they were recruiting Herschel Walker and they would bring him over to where African American women students were sitting saying, "See, we have black people here," (laughter).  The interesting thing about the University of Georgia during that period, or Georgia during that period was that's during the period of the missing and murdered student.  Or missing and murdered children in Atlanta [Atlanta Missing and Murdered Children cases; Atlanta Child Murders], and again here I go.  While everybody was studying, I worked with a group of students to organize bus trips up to Atlanta [Georgia] to look for bodies, in my first year of law school.  And people thought I was different down there too.  It was the kind of place where we did voter registration drives and it was still a period when, I remember knocking on someone's door and asking them to register to vote and a woman saying to me, "Naw baby, you know, I can't register, 'cause you know if you register, your name goes on a list, and bad things happen to you."
Speaker 1: That was in Atlanta at that time?
Speaker 2: Yeah so you know--
Speaker 1: I was in law school-
Speaker 2: So you, you understand exactly what I'm saying.
Speaker 1: Now were you involved in BLSA [Black Law Students Association]?
Speaker 2: Very much involved in BLSA from at my school, but not National BLSA [National Black Law Students Association]. I was a moot court person (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 639062
Speaker 1: Now you graduate from law school [University of Georgia School of Law, Athens, Georgia] in what year?
Speaker 2: Nineteen eighty-two [1982].
Speaker 1: And you come back to Chicago [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: As fast as I could (laughter).
Speaker 1: There weren't enough things for you to do in--
Speaker 2: It wasn't enough things for me to do in Athens, Georgia so I came back to the City of Chicago and I was committed.  I was coming back to the City of Chicago and I--the city was waiting for me and I was gonna change the world.  I had this law degree under my, under my belt, I came back, studied for the bar and went to work for E. Duke McNeil out on the South Side of the City of Chicago, until he passed away. I still had the, the record for working for Duke McNeil longer than anybody else in their entire career.  Which says a lot about who I am (laughter) if I can work for Duke McNeil for that long.
Speaker 1: Many years would that would, what was that time?
Speaker 2: Probably three and half years.
Speaker 1: So from '82 [1982] to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) For probably about '85 [1985] yeah, Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And where did you go from there?
Speaker 2: From working for McNeil, I went to the United Auto Workers [United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America] to their legal services organization, UAW Legal Services.  One of the benefits that the UAW provided to their employees was free legal services, and so we did all kinds of cases.  From everything from divorces to minor property loss and property casualty cases to wills and trusts.  And so it was basically a small law firm but we had one set of clients and we had a built in set of clients.  And they were all members of the United Auto Workers Union.  What it did for me was it--I learned where all the courthouses were in Joliet [Illinois] and Naperville [Illinois] and teeny tiny town outside of Illinois.  Will County [Illinois] and Lake County [Illinois] and here's this, this you know little African American lawyer from the City of Chicago in all these little courtrooms out there.  And I learned how to practice law; I learned how to represent clients.  It was also a period of time if you think about between the time I was working for Duke McNeil and United Auto Workers, when we were electing Harold Washington.  And so we, when I was at McNeil, McNeil was very much involved in Harold Washington's first campaign.  He and Reverend Jackson [HistoryMaker Reverend Jesse L. Jackson] were at that time were, were inseparable, he was Reverend Jackson's lawyer during that period.  And so that was when I got to know that whole crew from, from, from Reverend Jackson and, and Clay Evans [HistoryMaker Reverend Clay Evans] and Harold Washington.  And I was the young lawyer, I was the young lawyer who volunteered for all kinds of stuff, I--whether it was working with NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] and doing research for them.  Or helping work with petitions for different campaigns.  I remember when we first elected Harold and being at Reverend Jackson's house when everybody came over after Harold's election when he decided he was gonna run for president, and being a fly on the wall.  And thinking to myself, oh my god we just elected a mayor, how in the world we gonna elect a president (laughter)?  But it was a heady time in politics in the City of Chicago, so my job was how I earned my living to pay my rent.  But there was all this stuff going on in the political community in the City of Chicago that was where I used my talents and my tools.  My son [Maurice Cousin] will tell you he had a little tux during that period, because he was my date for all these different events.  And he was with us everywhere and he could actually do, he could actually give you Harold Washington's stump speech when he was in grammar school. 'Cause he had seen it so many times.  But it was, it was an amazing time to be a lawyer and have the tools to bring to the table to work in, in this community.
Story_ID: 639063
Speaker 1: How long were you at the United Auto Workers [UAW Legal Services]?
Speaker 2: Okay not long because then I went to--let's see we elected Harold [Harold Washington], I was at UAW and so I went to the Water Reclamation District [Metropolitan Water Reclamation District of Greater Chicago].  In as the, in their affirmative action office at the Water Reclamation District.
Speaker 1: What year was that?
Speaker 2: And it was probably, feel like I need my resume in front of me, it was '96 [1996], '95 [1995], '96 [1996].  So obviously, at this point I'm doing everything for about two years, everything's about two years, and so I go to the Water Reclamation District as an affirmative action officer.
Speaker 1: Was Carlton Lowe there during that period?
Speaker 2: Unh-uh (shakes head).
Speaker 1: Okay I had worked with him at the FTC [Federal Trade Commission].
Speaker 2: I don't remember him.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But again as I said the, it was a job, yes we did, I, I wrote for them the practicing procedures for investigating affirmative action claims.  While I was at the Water Reclamation District, I would do inspections of projects at sludge fields.  I had work boots where I would go out to the sludge fields; you get so much sludge in your nose hairs that you couldn't even smell it anymore.
Story_ID: 639064
Speaker 1: But we had elected Harold Washington and we were working with Cook County Bar Association and they, we felt like we being the black women lawyers felt like they weren't giving us enough respect.  So we started our own bar association during this period that is when we started the Black Women Lawyers Association [Black Women Lawyers Association of Greater Chicago]. So you know yeah I was working at Metropolitan Sanitary District [Metropolitan Sanitary District of Greater Chicago; Metropolitan Water Reclamation District of Greater Chicago] but we were starting a bar association.  And I was the first president of black women bar association during that period.  Because, and I remember sitting with [HistoryMaker] Arnette Hubbard when I told her that we want to start a bar association. And if you know Arnette she sat there and she took a long drag on her cigarette and she said, "Why y'all think you need your own bar association?  But what, what, what we have bar association, Cook County Bar Association has a rich history."  I said, "Because we want to be in charge," and she said, and I said, "and it's not as though we gonna leave the Cook County Bar Association.  But as African American women, we'll never be in charge of the Cook County Bar Association."
Speaker 2: Arnette was a president of the bar association, Cook County--
Speaker 1: Yes she was but she knew that she was still a rarity. You could still count the number of, of black women presidents as women presidents at Cook County Bar Association in the sa- by that, at that point.
Speaker 2: Lynn Thapedi [Llewellyn Greene Thapedi].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Keep going (laughter).
Speaker 2: Well I can name two (laughter). I can name two (laughter).
Speaker 1: During that period for the National Bar Association we had still had still only had two African American women.
Speaker 2: Arnette was one of them.
Speaker 1: Arnette was one of them.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah and Arthenia Joyner was the other, and that was it, and so I said we're not working to replace the Cook County Bar Association.  We're also not gonna be an auxiliary of the Cook County Bar Association, but it's, it is a place where young women lawyers can, can develop their leadership skills and make a difference.  And she said okay I'll, I'll join, and she became a member.  The good part about what we did with Black Women Lawyers Association though was that we committed that you could not be president for more than two terms.  And each of us the, as we recognized that this was a place for young women lawyers to learn leadership skills.  So as we you, I served as president for two years to, as the first president for the first two terms.
Speaker 2: What year was that?
Speaker 1: Oh nineteen eighty--'87 [1987], '88 [1988]. Eighty-seven [1987], '88 [1988] yeah.
Speaker 2: Let me kick it off for you here.
Speaker 1: Eighty-six [1986], '87 [1987] yeah.
Speaker 2: Eighty-seven [1987], '88 [1988].
Story_ID: 639065
Speaker 1: Now we're at '87 [1987].
Speaker 2: Um-hm. Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And you're involved with the black women's bar association [Black Women Lawyers Association of Greater Chicago].
Speaker 2: Um-hm. Who are you working for at this time, you're still the Water Reclamation--
Speaker 1: I'm still at the Water Reclamation District [Metropolitan Water Reclamation District of Greater Chicago], but then I decided I should run for commissioner of the Water Reclamation District because it wasn't being run well.  And why wouldn't I run for commissioner and then we could change it?  Same thing how do we continue to change things?  But at that period of time, the Water Reclamation District was an at large election.  Was a low ballot, no visibility at large election that you had to win countywide, and the top three won.  Shows how naive I was though, because, but we actually ran the best yuppie buppie campaign that the city had ever seen.  Because at this point, I'm what twenty-nine years old, about '87 [1987] yeah that's about right.  Yeah I was born in '57 [1957] yeah, so we were, I ran.  We had bus stop signs, "L" [elevated train] stop signs-- that was when I learned that bus stop signs and "L" stop signs do not vote.  And so you can have lots of bus stop signs and "L" stop signs does not when your, mean you gonna win an election.  Also because it was a low visibility office and I was not the Democratic nominee, the Democratic chosen candidate there.  There were twelve people on the ballot; I was not the Democratic candidate, but their party candidate on the ballot.  It means that I got beat terribly in all of the white wards around the county, but I won, I came in you, as I said it was they, the top three win.  And I came in first, second or third in all the lakefront wards and all the African American wards in the city.  So what it did was it made the Democratic Party take notice, and they were like oh my god, you know this is somebody who is actually smart and has put together something here.  Because we did put together a coalition of, of young activists whites from the international, I- independent voters association of Illinois [Independent Voters of Illinois Independent Precinct Organization].  IVI IPO on the North Side, as well as from Buffy [ph.] on the South Side of the City of Chicago [Illinois], and the churches on the West Side on the City of Chicago.  And so after I lost, I went and got another job at the, the ethics board of the city, but--
Speaker 2: Now year was it, was this election?
Speaker 1: The election was an off year election, so it's probably '87 [1987].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's probably '87 [1987]. Okay, I feel like I should have my resume in front of me so I can make sure all of my years are absolutely correct.  So don't hold me to the exact year here.  It was, in, so and because it was an off year election, then I was at the, ethics board of the city [Board of Ethics]. I was working at the ethics board when Neil Hartigan decided that he was gonna run for governor.  And so the party came and asked me to serve on his campaign as deputy campaign manager, but they first went, when I first went to work for the Illinois attorney general's office, and was volunteer on the campaign.  And so I served as the West Side regional director for the Illinois attorney general's office.  And opened the first office for them in Austin [Chicago, Illinois] on Pulaski [Road] and, and Washington [Boulevard], serving the West Side of the City of Chicago, and the near west suburbs.
Story_ID: 639066
Speaker 1: So this would've been, would this been the year that Harold [Harold Washington] died?
Speaker 2: This would've been the year. Harold died in '87 [1987].
Speaker 1: Eighty-seven [1987], right.
Speaker 2: So yeah, this was at the end of '87 [1987]. Yeah he, when Harold, I was, I was at the ethics board [Board of Ethics] when Harold died. Is that right?  Boy I'm getting old. No Harold was still alive when I went to work for Neil Hartigan, so.  Yeah I was already working for Neil Hartigan 'cause we had elected [HistoryMaker] Bobbie Steele.  See I left, there's so much. Gosh this is amazing, I should write a book (laughter).  But yeah so Harold, this was the year that Harold died that I had gone, I left the ethics board and gone to the Illinois attorney general's office.  And at the Illinois attorney general's office my relationship back to the city and to the county was through Cook County Commissioner Bobbie Steele, who was from the West Side of the city [Chicago, Illinois].  And I remember vividly, since you brought up Harold I'll take a moment here.  The day that Harold died and after he died being in, in city hall [Chicago City Hall, Chicago, Illinois] at the, on the county side of the building, and then going over to the city side.  Because it's just so unbelievable when he passed away.  But the more interesting time was the night that the city council [Chicago City Council] elected--
Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] Eugene Sawyer.
Speaker 2: Eugene Sawyer mayor and we were all in Bobbie Steele's office on the fifth floor, 'cause her offices were on the fifth floor on the county side.  And all of this was going on, on the second floor on the city side, and going back and forth between the two.  And just being a witness to all of that and how our city was changing from this place that I was talking about earlier that was so vibrant and so exciting when we thought we were changing the world when we were electing Harold Washington and, and Reverend Jackson [HistoryMaker Reverend Jesse L. Jackson] was running for president to the night that it all turned over when Gene Sawyer was elected (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And before you had council wars.
Speaker 2: You, oh that was, that's a whole 'nother conversation (laughter), but it all, it all seemed to change on that night.
Story_ID: 639067
Speaker 1: Now from '87 [1987] you were working at, with the Illinois attorney general's office.
Speaker 2: Right and then Neil Hartigan's election was in '88 [sic.], and I was the deputy campaign manager on his campaign.  And I left when we got into, into the general election; I left the attorney general's office and went full time on the campaign, during the general election.  And it was the first time that an African American or a woman had served at that level in a general election for the Democratic Party or Republican Party in the State of Illinois.  And I remember working with Neil Hartigan and Bill Filan [William Filan] and they taught me campaigning.  That was how I learned how to count votes and you know how to read a poll and how to do fundraising.  And the, you know, to open up the backrooms that weren't open to people who look like us.  We participated in campaigns but we weren't at the table when decisions were being made.  So to actually have the opportunity to sit in the room with people like Mike Madigan [Michael Madigan] and Neil Hartigan, and was when I first met Dick Durbin.  And, and it was eye opening, it was absolutely eye opening.  We lost by probably one vote per precinct, we lost by about fifty thousand votes.
Speaker 1: So your, your counting wasn't very good (laughter)?
Speaker 2: My counting was very good. It doesn't mean that we got every vote though.  The challenge was that Jim Edgar did a good job pulling off African American community votes, if you remember.  And, and I remember being on the stage on the South Side of the City of Chicago [Illinois], and having congressmen from the 2nd Ward, 2nd Congressional District at that point, [HistoryMaker] Gus Savage.  Gus Savage (laughter) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That's a whole 'nother story.
Speaker 2: That's a whole 'nother story too, but Gus Savage got up on the stage when I was speaking and saying that, because you know if they, we're talking Irish and black politics in the City of Chicago.  Now I was working for the Irish people. I had been part of the progressive movement, but here I was now representing this, the white Irish guys, and now I'm on the South Side of City of Chicago.  And I remember Gus Savage getting up on the stage and saying you know, "Some black women will do anything for a blah, blah."  It was just unbelievable to the point where it ended up on the front page of the city section of the Chicago Tribune the next day.  And the sh- the--and who protected me, the Shaw brothers [Robert Shaw and HistoryMaker William E. Shaw] of all people (laughter) vivid, visibly and, and literally taking Gus Savage off the stage.  And saying to me, "We may not agree with you, but we will not have you disrespected."  But the one thing that election taught me, as I said they taught me politics.  They also taught me that power does not have a color, and it was an amazing lesson that too many African American politicians in the City of Chicago still have not learned today.  It is not an us versus them from a color standpoint. It should not be. We cannot afford that.  They know it, it's about it, it was much more about who controls jobs and money, as opposed to what race you are.  And when we and, and, and can get into that with when we talk about Barack [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama], but Barack always knew it's not about race.  And it took the form of race 'cause that's easier than talking about power and money.  And so it's better when we have the opportunities to get in and be part of the team and ensure that there's opportunities for people who look like us.  As opposed to saying they are not like us, so I refuse to work with them.  Because it must be someone who looks like me for it to be right.
Story_ID: 639068
Speaker 1: Okay now from the Hartigan [Neil Hartigan] campaign [for Illinois governor]--
Speaker 2: So--
Speaker 1: This was what?
Speaker 2: After I learned all those hard lessons on the Hartigan campaign and lost (laughter), I took some time off.  By this time Maurice [Cousin's son, Maurice Cousin] is in high school. He's in, playing football and he was on the national--he was playing in the national high school football finals in Florida.  And I remember going down to Florida. He took a bus down, I took a plane down to watch him play in Florida.  And taken a week off and just driving around, and then I went to, and I'd been asked by AT&T [AT&T Inc.] to come and interview for them for a job.
Speaker 1: And what year was this?
Speaker 2: This was eighty-- this is still late '88 [1988]. It's November '88 [1988], that's when the election was [sic.].  So November of '88 [1988] and it's December of '88 [1988] now and I came back and interviewed for the job at AT&T and I got it.
Speaker 1: And what job, what, what position was it?
Speaker 2: I was the director of government affairs, and so now I'm learning to lobby.  So it is after the time of the breakup of Ma Bell and we're writing the telecommunications act and rewriting the telecommunications act in Illinois and so I, I was part of the team at AT&T that wrote it.  That's how I got to know Emil Jones [HistoryMaker Emil Jones, Jr.], and worked very closely with Mike Madigan [Michael Madigan] again, and a, so I'm at AT&T and it's '89 [1989] and we're doing redistricting.  And it's after the '90 [1990] census; we do redistricting in '90 [1990].  And Mike Madigan decides that he wants me to serve as his appointee to the redistricting commission, to the Illinois redistricting.  To re- to draw the lines for redistricting in the State of Illinois for the state legislature [Illinois General Assembly].  And so here I am again, I'm the only black person in the redistricting commission in the State of Illinois, and the only woman.  And so you know I was quoted in the Trib [Chicago Tribune] as saying I, you know I represented all the black people and women in the State of Illinois (laughter).  The lawsuit that was ultimately filed as a result of the map is Ertharin Cousin versus the State of Illinois [ph.].  And I filed, the lawsuit was filed in my name on behalf of the whole Democratic Party.  And all the sitting legislators who we felt were unfairly redistricted.  The interesting thing about that period though was I'm still working for AT&T and we are now getting into a presidential election for Bill Clinton [President William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton].  And I remember the first time someone asked me about working for Bill Clinton, I said this is the guy who spoke at the convention for an hour or something from Arkansas.  You know my mother's [Annie Harris Cousin] gonna be president before him 'cause this was when Gennifer Flowers and everything was out.  Said no way is this guy ever gonna be president of the United States, so okay my senses are not always good, you can tell that.
Speaker 1: Now Richard Daley [Richard M. Daley] was also running for mayor [of Chicago, Illinois] around this time.
Speaker 2: Richie Daley was also running for mayor but I was not very much involved in the mayor's campaign at all.  And 'cause I was doing redistricting and focused on you know trying to raise my son [Maurice Cousin] (laughter) going through all (laughter) of this.  And, and, and so I worked for the redistricting was at AT&T, working on the rewrite of the, of the telecommunications act.  So I'm down in Springfield [Illinois]; I'm going back and forth.  By this time my son's at Lake Forest Academy [Lake Forest, Illinois], we're living in Highland Park [Illinois], and I'm traveling back and forth from Springfield.  And he was living on campus. It was an amazing time in my life, and how many balls can you juggle in the air.  For the first time I was actually making some money (laughter) and we're back to Monsignor Egan [John J. Egan] again.  Monsignor Egan brings a busload of protestors down to Springfield and they are protesting changes in the, they're protesting changes in the, in the TANF benefits [Temporary Assistance for Needy Families], the public aid benefits for poor people in--particularly in the City of Chicago [Illinois].  And Monsignor Egan drinks scotch at lunch. That was his lunch.  And he if you remember I told you he was very influential in my life as a child, and he still saw me as one of the little Cousin girls.  I'm all of that. Now I'm a lobbyist down in Springfield, and I was one of two women, not just women of color, but two women lobbying for business interests down there.  And he took me out for scotch and he said, "Is this really what you think God gave you all this talent for, to rewrite the telecommunications act?  Is this really what you're supposed to be doing?"
Speaker 1: And your response was?
Speaker 2: "I'm paying for my son to go to Lake Forest Academy and this is what we worked for so that we can have these kinds of opportunities."  But they were all excuses and I knew he was right, and so and, and but I didn't change anything at that point.

Speaker 1: We go into the summer.
Speaker 2: This was '91 [1991]?
Speaker 1: This is, this is '91 [1991]. We're going into the summer. By now it's, we first elected Bill Clinton [President William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton] in '92 [1992] right, yes, so this is '92 [1992].  And we're going into the, into the conventions, and so I'm working for AT&T [AT&T Inc.] and so I go to the Democratic Convention [1992 Democratic National Convention, New York, New York].  And we take a delegation to the Democratic Convention. AT&T does dinners, and we take people out to dinner and all of that.  And I go to the Republican Convention [1992 Republican National Convention].  And if you remember in 1992 at the Republican Convention it was in Houston, Texas and this is when Pat Buchanan made his speech about our America and our party.  Very different from Barack Obama's [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama] speech (laughter) in 2004 [at the Democratic National Convention, Boston, Massachusetts]; much more about how this is our country.  And I was on the floor of the Republican Convention when he made that speech.
Speaker 2: Lobbying for AT&T?
Speaker 1: Lobbying for AT&T but you don't lobby on the floor; I was just visiting with friends (laughter). You don't lobby on the floor of a convention, but I was visiting with friends.  And went back to my hotel room and called David Wilhelm on the phone who was Bill Clinton's campaign manager.  And said, "Anything you want me to do to help elect this man, you got me."
Speaker 2: Now what was, when did you first meet David Wilhelm?
Speaker 1: Oh my when did I first meet David? David was a fixture. Yeah we're in politics in Chicago [Illinois], but Chicago is a big small town.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And if you're David Axelrod, David Wilhelm, A- Alexis, I'm sorry [HistoryMaker] Avis LaVelle, we all knew each other. We all worked together.  They, and, and you, you couldn't not know each other, and be involved.  So David and I were colleagues and drinking buddies and had served through you know stuff in the city.  He, everybody was involved if you, during Harold's [Harold Washington] campaign, we were all young, and, and we were all out here.  So I called David and came back and did volunteer for the campaign. I'm still working at AT&T, but I was volunteering now in the evenings for Bill Clinton's campaign.  And I did communications I mean, for Bill Clinton's campaign and I did surrogate support, I you know people would fly in like the, governor of, of Virginia, help me, first black governor of Virginia.
Speaker 2: Wilder?
Speaker 1: Wilder [HistoryMaker L. Douglas Wilder]. Wilder came in and took him to black churches all over the South Side of the City of Chicago.  Ran, help run the communications operation for Election Day for Bill Clinton's campaign, and lo and behold we finally win an election.  We finally elect a president and I remember the night of Bill Clinton's victory.  That I got dressed up in a spangly black tie dress to go down to the victory party 'cause I said we've finally won one.  And after we won, I'm still at AT&T and David calls and says come to Washington [D.C.], and I did.
Story_ID: 639070
Speaker 1: That was '93 [1993]?
Speaker 2: It was in '93 [1993].  So I went to Washington [D.C.], first for the DNC, for the Democratic National Committee as research director.  And did all the opposition research and again it was the first time an African American had ever held that position for the Democratic Party.  And served in that position for David [David Wilhelm] for a while and then became the deputy chief of staff for the Democratic Party.  When David left the party after the midterm elections, people thought I was gonna leave.  But the, Kevin O'Keefe, and another Irish guy from the City of Chicago [Illinois] (laughter) said, "Don't leave. We have big things that we want you to do."  And he said, "I noticed on your resume that you studied law and, and international law at the U- University of Georgia [University of Georgia School of Law, Athens, Georgia.]  And I had studied with Dean Rusk, international law at the University of Georgia; he said, "We need a political person at the state department [U.S. Department of State]."  And so when David left the DNC, I became the White House liaison for between the White House and the state department for the Clinton administration [President William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton].
Speaker 1: Now O'Keefe was at the state department?
Speaker 2: O'Keefe was in the White House.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Kevin was the deputy director for intergovernmental affairs at the White House. Kevin was Hillary Clinton's [Hillary Rodham Clinton] next door neighbor in high school. They grew up together.  And so he had been friends with the Clintons for you know twenty-five years, and he had known me from working with Neil Hartigan and Mike Madigan [Michael Madigan] and all the guys here.  As well--
Speaker 1: What did that job entail?
Speaker 2: Being White House liaison? I was the person who was responsible for all the political hirings and firings inside the department.  Also for all of the domestic, the, I, messaging of our foreign policy in the state department. In other words, we, I did talk shows with, with Madeleine Albright in, in Cleveland, Ohio.
Speaker 1: She was secretary of state at the time?
Speaker 2: She was, nope she wasn't secretary of state yet. She was at, she was the--she had Susan Rice's job as admin- ambassador to the United Nations.  That was what she did in the first Clinton.  And--
Speaker 1: Who was secretary of state?
Speaker 2: Warren Christopher, Warren Christopher.  And, and I was part of the team that did all the prep work for the women's conference in China, and that Hillary Clinton chaired as first lady in Beijing [Fourth World Conference on Women, Beijing, China].  I was the secretary's--I was the Secretary Clinton's, I'm sorry, I was Secretary Christopher's special advisor for the Olympics. And I did all the visa entry issues for the Olympics in Atlanta in '96 [1996 Summer Olympics, Atlanta, Georgia]. And which means that I was part of the team that after bombing at the Atlanta Olympics was on a plane with First Lady Clinton.  At that point going to Atlanta [Georgia] to determine how we ensure that the games were safe and that they would continue to be a sess- success for the City of Atlanta.
Speaker 1: This would've been what '96 [1996], '95 [1995] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It was '96 [1996]. Ninety-five [1995], '96 [1996], yeah so.
Story_ID: 639071
Speaker 1: It was very project oriented job. It was one of those positions where the, the, you know when things happened that the administration needed support for, from the state department [U.S. Department of State] or the, I was the person that you picked up the phone and called.  Whether it was Congressman X is on a plane on his way to Shanghai [China] and his passport has expired (laughter).  It was not a policy job, it was a get things done job, but what it did was, I was a junior officer inside the state department, junior political officer.  And I got to know the career officers inside the state department and learned how America gets things done around the world from an operational standpoint.  Because our diplomacy is, is as much about what we do is what we say.   And there's a, an entire group of people in the United State government who's spent their entire career ensuring that the things that we say, that we can do.  In, in what, regardless of who's sitting in the White House, and so I got to know all of those folks.  Who work in, in our counsel affairs and our passport offices and our management offices, and it was, it was an amazing time.  And I, I had a, a very, a mentor then who happens to still be my mentor now, Pat Kennedy [Patrick F. Kennedy], who was our undersecretary well he wasn't undersecretary then. He was assistant secretary for management now.  He's an undersecretary for management in the Obama [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama] administration.  And he told me he said, "You know we're the state department, we can do pretty much anything," (laughter).  And it was so it was, it was, it was truly going to-- getting a graduate degree in international affairs without going back to school. Strobe Talbott was the deputy secretary during that period, and Strobe had a meeting every morning at nine o'clock with all the assistant secretaries where he would do an hour around the world of everything that happened that night, and I was one of the junior officers who sat on that back bench on the wall every morning.  And you had to--had to have a top secret clearance in order to be there, and his rule was that if anything ever leaked out of the meeting, he would cancel the meetings.  And he would meet one on one with his assistant secretaries.  But that the way everybody kept in the loop and you knew that whatever you learned there was not to leave that room.  Yeah I was the person, I was--I had the opportunity if you remember when Ron Brown's plane went down of being in the Situation Room.  And sitting on the floor and listening to them as they were scouting the side of the mountain looking for his body.
Speaker 2: And what year would this be?
Speaker 1: This was '95 [1995], '96 [1996].
Story_ID: 639072
Speaker 1: Now '96 [1996].
Speaker 2: Ninety-six [1996] they said okay Ertharin [HistoryMaker Ertharin Cousin], it's time for you to go back out and run the campaign.  So I came back to Illinois and I was the, I took a leave of absence from the state department [U.S. Department of State] and became the state director for Clinton's [President William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton] reelection campaign.
Speaker 1: Now who asked you to do that?
Speaker 2: Kevin O'Keefe (laughter), yeah Kevin O'Keefe and--
Speaker 1: And what was his position then?
Speaker 2: He was still in the White House. He was still director of intergovernmental, but he was very much part of the president's inner circle.
Speaker 1: Okay and from that?
Speaker 2: From, we won (laughter), I went back to Washington [D.C.] and served on the inaugural committee to, as the head of the director for basically the, for politics at the inaugural.  I was responsible for who, all the invitations that went out to the inaugural it was just an amazing position, and planning to go back to the state department.  It was at that point that I got a phone call from, from the head of the Illinois Retail Merchants Association here in Illinois [David F. Vite], who said, "Jewel Food Stores [Jewel-Osco] needs a vice president of government and community affairs, and I told them that they can't do any better than you, if you'll come back home."
Story_ID: 639073
Speaker 1: I wanna go back just for a minute or two to the Clinton/Gore campaign. You were running the Illinois--
Speaker 2: I was the Illinois state director.
Speaker 1: Okay, what did that involve?
Speaker 2: In--as state director I was basically the political person representing the campaign here.  You had a field leader and a political leader and a field leader is primarily responsible for GOTV and, and getting out the vote. I was much more responsible for the relationships with all of the different constituencies in the State of Illinois.  And my team was a small one and we had a political director, a communications director as well as a number of volunteers from across the state.  And our responsibility was actually getting the messages out for the campaign.  And ensuring that we were getting media on a regular basis for the campaign.  In 1996 when working on the campaign, Illinois was a clear blue state at that point.  We had both the House [Illinois House of Representatives] and the, and the, both the House and the Senate [Illinois Senate] in state legislature.  And it was a in the, in what we would call the win column early on, but at the same time you don't ignore your base.  And so what is important with a state like Illinois is ensuring that you have people on the ground who can continue to build up enthusiasm about the campaign to ensure that you get the voters out.  And that was what we were responsible for doing.  It was a time when voter registration was very important, and that was the first time that I had the opportunity to meet and work with even from distant point then with Barack Obama [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama].  Barack was a young community organizer during that period, and he was running a voter registration drive on the South Side of the City of Chicago [Illinois].  That was probably one of the most successful voter registration drives that I had seen in my career to that point.  And it was very interesting because he seemed to come out of nowhere and just, and he was an early star.  But it was also the time when Dick Durbin was running for the state, for the United States Senate for the first time.  And we shared office space, they had their own, well we shared a doorway.  And so I had the opportunity to work with him for the first time and get to know he and his team.  Which has been an instrumental relationship throughout my career since then, because he was a person who was from southern Illinois.  But was committed to the exact same kind, the issues that, that I had been for my entire career, my entire life.  So it was, it was a, it was a good campaign, the most fun for me, we, when you're a blue state early on as you don't get to see the president very much, but you can see the vice president.  So I got to know Al Gore very, very well during that period, and I remember taking Al Gore to Bishop Brazier's [HistoryMaker Bishop Arthur Brazier] church, out on the South Side on the of the City of Chicago.  And having Al Gore who everybody said was so stiff, basically turn out an Apostolic Baptist Church, Ap- Apostolic Church [Apostolic Church of God] on the South Side of the City of Chicago.  And give a sermon to a crowd of African Americans on the South Side of the City of Chicago that most people never believe that he had in him.  And it told me a lot then about who he was as a person separate and apart from who you saw on the cameras.  So I, it was a period where again using all of the tools that I had learned early on working on the Hartigan [Neil Hartigan] campaign is and, and working in politics in Illinois to now represent a presidential candidate [President William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton] for one end of the state to the other.
Story_ID: 639074
Speaker 1: Now after the [1996 presidential] election you win, you come, you're coming back to Illinois now.
Speaker 2: After I came, I well was, did the inaugural, I was offered an opportunity to come back by Dave Vite [David F. Vite], who was with the Illinois Retail Merchants Association. He's still with the Illinois Retail Merchants Association as president suggested me to Jewel Food Stores [Jewel-Osco] as their new vice president, for position as vice president of government and community affairs.  It was not an easy decision to leave the administration to come back and take a job in Corporate America.  But I had been a single parent all of Maurice's [Maurice Cousin] life, he was down at FAMU [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida] at this point.  He had worked on the campaign as a regional field organizer down in Florida and then went on to FAMU and finished and graduated there.  And so I was in love and the person I was in love with was living here in Chicago [Illinois].  And so I made my decision based upon personal reasons to leave the administration, buy the big house out in Oak Park [Illinois] and go to work for Corporate America.  But I got to tell you, when I sat in that first officers' meeting where we were talking about out of stocks and green peas, and I'm thinking oh my god!  What have I done to my career that I am now working out of stocks and green peas, as opposed to working on the first lady's trip to the women's conference in Beijing, China [Fourth World Conference on Women].  So it was a tough decision and it was even tougher because Madeleine Albright became secretary of state, and because the relationship that I had with her she had asked come, become of her senior advisors, and I turned that down to get married and come back here.
Speaker 1: And to work on peas.
Speaker 2: And work on peas, but the great thing, the great interesting thing that happened then, I was the vice president of government and community affairs, which meant that my job was to work doing what I'd always done.  And that was building relationships with stakeholders in our communities across the service area of Jewel Food Stores at that point.  And so building stores and, and working with elected officials in, in the communities where I lived.  The 39th Street store on the South Side of the City of Chicago, I was instrumental in helping us build a store on Roosevelt [Road] and Wabash [Avenue] in downtown Chicago.  And ensuring that we built the store at 95th [Street] and Stony Island [Avenue]; they had been trying to build that store for ten years before I got here.  And it was the first store that we actually had an African American contractor build and so I can probably say that it was because I was sitting at the table and said if we're building a store on the South Side of City of Chicago, we must use an African American contractor, and everybody said, "Yeah that's right."  And so Paul King [HistoryMaker Paul J. King] became the first African American contractor to build a Jewel Food Store.
Story_ID: 639075
Speaker 1: So now you're into food.
Speaker 2: Now I'm in food (laughter) and the great thing that happened though, I decide I wanna leave the administration, I'm gonna do food.  And they said, "Okay, we're not gonna let you get that far away," and they appointed me to the, the BIFAD, the Board for International Food and Agricultural Development.  Which is was, and is and was and still is an advisory board that of experts of food and agriculture who work on food security and hunger relief across the world.  And I served on that board for four years during the second Clinton [President William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton] administration, and so it was my first real entree in getting involved in food security.
Speaker 1: Now this was a volunteer thing?
Speaker 2: It was a, it was a presidential appointment (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Were you still working at Jewel [Jewel Food Stores; Jewel-Osco]?
Speaker 2: I was working at Jewel, it was a presidential appointment; it was a board.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay and you were on, involved in a couple of other boards involving food.
Speaker 2: Yes I was on the board of Second Harvest, America's Harvest and but--I went on the board of America's Second Harvest [America's Second Harvest - The Nation's Food Bank Network; Feeding America] after the merger.  There was a merger at Jewel between, I thi- part of the reasons I took the job at Jewel as I said I was getting married.  Bought the house in the suburbs [Oak Park, Illinois] and I'm thinking I'm gonna settle down. I was going--growing roses in my backyard.  And Jewel was owned by American Stores [American Stores Company]. American Stores got bought by Albertsons [Albertsons, Inc.] and so I became the senior vice pres- first group vice president of Albertsons after the merger.  And I, what I was doing for Jewel they asked me to do for the entire country, and so the same kind of public affairs community outreach.  Government affairs, communications I had been focusing on just in this market, I then led a team that did it for the entire country.  As part of that, I was asked to join the board of America's Second Harvest.
Speaker 1: And what were your, what, what did that involve?
Speaker 2: Serving on the, America's Second Harvest is the nation's largest hunger relief, domestic hunger relief organization.  There're about two hundred forty food banks around the country that serve--that support about fifty thousand food kitchens, pantries, soup kitchens and other food distribution points in every neighborhood in the entire country, and feeding probably about 50 million people a year through America's Second Harvest.  And as a board member, we were responsible for the oversight of the financials of the organization as well the opers- operations of the organization.
Speaker 1: Okay now how long did you stay at Albertsons?
Speaker 2: I was at Albertsons from ninety--let's see '96 [1996], '97 [1997] when I went to Jewel, and then I left Albertsons in probably 2004, 2003, yeah.
Story_ID: 639076
Speaker 1: And where did you go from there?
Speaker 2: From there I became the chief operating officer of America's Second Harvest [America's Second Harvest - The Nation's Food Bank Network; Feeding America]. My dad [Julius Cousin] passed away in 2003.  And I still had Monsignor Egan [John J. Egan] on the brain because now I'm making lots of money working for yet another large corporation.  And while we were doing amazing things with building stores in underserved neighborhoods around the country, creating opportunities for charitable contributions, and corporate social responsibility that didn't exist before I and my team came into ca- into the company.  It was still my primary responsibility was delivering a message that would support our quarterly earnings that would ensure that we were bringing shareholder value.  And that after a while wasn't what I really wanted to do, and so I knew that anybody could do that.  Anyone with talent could continue to do that, but very few people have the commitment to serve.  And so when the opportunity opened up to become the chief operating officer with possibility of becoming CEO at America's Second Harvest, I left Albertsons [Albertsons, Inc.] to go and do it.
Speaker 1: And what did that involve?
Speaker 2: Running the day to day operations of this behemoth of a food, of a non-governmental organization that supported these two hundred forty food banks around the country, doing the national fundraising for them.  Food banking was basically created by the retail food, the retail food industry and the Grocery Manufacturers Association. And then food banking is probably, it's only about a thirty, thirty-five year old insti- in- institution.  In the first one was in Phoenix, Arizona, and what it was wha- what the food banks are is taking product that for years that had been thrown away.  And putting that product into a warehouse and then giving, providing an opportunity for smaller organizations to access that food.  So it made it very easy, what food banks did and continue to do is made it very easy for large national, multinational corporations to give.  Because instead of giving to fifty thousand small organizations, they would give to America's Second Harvest that would distribute the food to the two hundred forty food banks around the country that would then provide access to that food from, from all of the neighborhood organizations and the church pantries, et cetera.  Be, what food banks also ensured was that the food didn't go into the secondary market for sale. That certain quality controls were maintained.  If it was frozen food that it would stay frozen until it got to the kitchen of the person that it was going to be delivered to.  If it was food that needed to be repackaged or reprocessed that you had all of the proper sanitation facilities in place.  And so the liability issues that large manufactures or retailers were concerned about would--the responsibility for those issues would then bur- became the burden of the, of, of America's Second Harvest.  And then we, so we a- avoided the legal issues that the companies would have donations so my responsibility was to make sure that all that stuff actually happened.  And that this team of peop- very dedicated people had the recourses that they need to ensure that we could continue to distribute the food to the two hundred forty food banks.  And then distributed to the fifty thousand entities around the country.
Speaker 1: And were they located in Chicago [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: They are located in Chicago, and they're right on Wacker Drive, Wacker and, and Wabash [Avenue].
Speaker 1: Did your experience with Albertsons help you in that position?
Speaker 2: Completely. Albertsons was a major donor to America's Second Harvest. The grocery retailers today are still the largest donors.  And the, now the number one largest donor to, they've changed the name from America's Second Harvest to Feeding America is Walmart [Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.].  Because Walmart is now the largest grocery company--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --in the country.
Story_ID: 639077
Speaker 1: There was some involvement with Hurricane Katrina with your organization.
Speaker 2: Yeah I remember the morning that, but the, the, if you remember with Hurricane Katrina cur- we were having a meeting the night that Hurricane Katrina hit.  And--
Speaker 1: You say we.
Speaker 2: We the--America's Second Harvest [America's Second Harvest - The Nation's Food Bank Network; Feeding America].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Was having a meeting the night Hurricane Katrina hit, and it was a bad hurricane but it was not a devastating hurricane.  It was not until that night after we'd all gone to bed and the levees broke that the city flooded.  And so I remember waking up that morning to the city flooding, and having the CEO call me and say, "Is your television on?"  And looking at this devastation that was beginning to take place in New Orleans [Louisiana].  And going into my office and meeting with my team and talking to the food banks from around the country and hearing this, this crise- and, and this crisis that was beginning to unfold.  At that point we did not know the level of the challenge no one did, and as people moved into the forum, into the stadium [Louisiana Superdome; Mercedes-Benz Superdome, New Orleans, Louisiana], you saw people in row boats trying to get out of the city.  We had a food bank inside of New Orleans. Our entire food bank team lost everything that they had.  We--Walmart [Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.] gave us a warehouse; we moved our entire operation for New Orleans into that warehouse.  And as the water stopped, I'm not going to say receded, because it hadn't begun to recede yet it just stopped (laughter) flooding so dramatically.  We realized the level of devastation and that people needed food and water.  What made America's Second Harvest special was that you had these food banks that had the relationships with all of these community organizations.  And these millions of volunteers in every community in which they served, including the Gulf Coast region.   And so when the Red Cross [American Red Cross] couldn't get into areas in New Orleans and along the coast of Mississippi and into Alabama, we could.  And so we were able to deliver food when they couldn't deliver food and water when they couldn't deliver water.  As I said we, our, we turned a Walmart store into a refuge for our entire food bank staff, 'cause they lived there and worked there, 'cause they didn't have homes.  And the outpouring of support from across America was amazing, because we were able to get it done. And so our donations skyrocketed we were getting donations from everybody from Oprah [Oprah Winfrey] to Reverend Jackson [HistoryMaker Reverend Jesse L. Jackson] out on the South Side [Chicago, Illinois].  I remember Reverend Jackson calling me on a Saturday morning saying, "All right, I've just done this food drive and we have about thirty pallets of food sitting on the street in front of," (laughter), "in front of our headquarters; can you come and get them?"  And so I had to get trucks on a Saturday morning to go there and get trucks and drive that product that he had gotten from people all over the South Side who just wanted to help down into the gulf region.
Speaker 1: Now one the big things in there Katrina episode was the federal government, FEMA [Federal Emergency Management Agency].
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: How were you able to interact or interface with them or were you able to?
Speaker 2: Well yes, we were. FEMA recognized very quickly that we could get food in and so we were given access.  And that was a big part of our ability to continue to move was that having relationships with the people who were inside of New Orleans would not help us if we could not get our trucks and our people inside of New Orleans.  So because we were able to partner with FEMA, and we had a MOU for operating with them even before this--
Speaker 1: Now explain what an MOU is (laughter).
Speaker 2: The, I'm sorry, memorandum of understanding that said that we would service one of their implementing partners, in case of an emergency.  We never thought we would need to use it at this scale of course, but they gave us access for our cars, for our people with badges.  With so that we could freely move inside of areas that were otherwise restricted to outsiders other than military and emergency personnel.  And we were considered part of the first responders for, by FEMA during the crisis.  The other thing that our relationship with FEMA allowed us to do was to access commodities from the United States Department of Agriculture.  So that we were able to access powdered milk and other staple items that we could get into the different areas of need.  And that relationship also served to ensure that the people who--we were able to communicate so we were able to get communications equipment and support from them as well.
Story_ID: 639078
Speaker 1: Now I'm sure you were very, very busy during all that, did you ever get the opportunity to actually go down there?
Speaker 2: I did, I did and I remember being on a plane as it landed at the airport, it was coming in.  And as you flew over New Orleans [Louisiana], the plane got suddenly quiet, as everybody looked out the window, and you saw a city that's normally green that was completely leafless.  The trees were leafless.
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: And it was just water.  By the time I got into the city the, the downtown areas, the water had receded so that you could drive in the downtown.  And there were certain hotels that were open that were being occupied by first responders and [U.S.] military and other service providers.  I remember staying in a hotel where they had big tubs of bottled water, because the water that came out of taps was not palatable.  And so you could not wash your face or take a shower. You, they gave you bottles of water that you could use to put on a washrag.  It was like going into a developing country to, to wash your face with and brush your teeth.  They brought in food from outside of the city, because they had no workers who were in the hotel to support it.  You know they gave you linens and you changed your own bed, because that was not what you were down--you were not coming down to vacation.  You coming down there working, it was very much like traveling in Sub-Saharan Africa today, but you were in New Orleans, Louisiana.  And I remember driving over into this, the southeast side and thinking I had never seen anything like this before.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Where houses were just torn apart like matchboxes and the debris was in the middle of the street. There were cars everywhere.  There was the, if you remember how they went into the houses they would mark Xs on it.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: On the houses and so you would know where you saw a one is that is how many bodies they had found inside (simultaneous)
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right. And some of those Xs are still there.
Speaker 2: And they were all still there.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: They were all still there. They were still working. They were still going in the houses.  But the good part about it was that when you saw people they wanted to know one of two things, either how they could help or how you can help them, or how you get, or how you can help their children more than anything else.  You know, what did you bring for my children?
Speaker 1: Now did the, did your organization [America's Second Harvest - The Nation's Food Bank Network; Feeding America] continue to do work in New Orleans?
Speaker 2: Yes we, the organization raised as I said an enormous amount of money, much of that was used to reopen the food bank inside the City of New Orleans.  Buy new freezers continue to transport product down in their help with, with refrigeration for the local food banks and food pantries.  And well you have to remember we talk about New Orleans, this just wasn't New Orleans. Some of the most devastated areas were in Gulf Coast Mississippi and Alabama.  You know I remember driving along highway 10 [Interstate 10] down, around the coast and going into Mississippi and seeing whole communities just washed away that had been beachfront areas.  When and, and so we were working in all of those areas as well to continue to supply the community organizations.  But the good part about it is that we weren't alone.  As people were able to get in there, people were coming from all around the country.  You've, I met volunteers from as far away as North Dakota and South Dakota who had gotten into their church van and were just coming down to help.  And it's, it is, it's, it's at times like that that you realize what a, a great country we live in.

Speaker 1: How long did you stay with Second Harvest [America's Second Harvest - The Nation's Food Bank Network; Feeding America]?
Speaker 2: I stayed with Second Harvest through 2005. Let me see, late 2005, early 2006. Yeah, early 2006.  The, the one of the things I really wanted from Second Harvest was to be the CEO, and at this point of my career I thought I had learned enough and was prepared to lead.  Particularly coming out of Katrina where I had served as team leader for all of our operations for the entire period that we operated with Hurricane Katrina.  Whether it was through fundraising piece of it or the operational distribution pieces of it, as well as the government affairs pieces and ensuring we had the right arrangements with the state, local and federal government to provide access as well as food.  Our board decided that they wanted to bring a candidate from the outside and I decided it was time for me to go.  Because--and I was gonna--I had started my own business.  The good part about it was Second Harvest was my first client (laughter) and I be- had a government affairs and public affairs from this and this was at the time of the farm bill [Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008].  So I lobbied on the Farm Bill for Second Harvest in Washington [D.C.] and I started the Polk Street Group [Polk Street Group, LLC, Chicago, Illinois], and it was my own firm.  And I worked Jewel Food Stores [Jewel-Osco] was a client it was, it's good when you can go back and all the people that you worked for say, "Okay fine you started a business I'll, I'll hire you."  And they did and we were doing really good stuff and growing a business and my son [Maurice Cousin] came to work for me.
Story_ID: 639080
Speaker 1: And I was in at Jim Montgomery's [HistoryMaker James D. Montgomery] house for a Christmas party in 2006, the business [Polk Street Group, LLC, Chicago, Illinois] was getting off the ground doing really well.  And I'm, run into this guy who, we had elected to the United States Senate who said hey you know I think I may be doing this thing.  And if I do this thing, I'm hoping you'll come with me, when this person, Barack Obama [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama], ran for Senate, I, he made the exact request to me.  And I said, "Barack, you are not gonna win Senate in the State of Illinois." I said it's (laughter) I said, "Come on.  Barack Obama, southern Illinois." I said, "That's an oxymoron, come on."  And after the primary when he won the Senate, I said, "My friend if you ever, whatever else you run for in life I am there."  So when he asked me in December of 2006 and said he thought he was gonna do this I said, "If you run I'm there."
Speaker 2: So you went from politics to food from food back to politics?
Speaker 1: (Laughter) And so we started talking on the phone and when he said he was going to run and he really did run, he told me he was gonna announce it.  He would call me on his cell phone, "I met with this person and I'm doing that.  We're gonna announce. I'm going to Springfield [Illinois] to make this big announcement." I said, "It's too cold. I'm not going down to Springfield. I'll meet you guys back in Chicago [Illinois]."  I remember the night of his announcement in 2007 in Chicago and he leaned down from the stage at the end of his speech and said, "When are you starting," (laughter)?  And I went on board very early on as one of his senior advisors, and I was still running my business.  At this point [HistoryMaker] Avis LaVelle and I were working together. And Avis was running the business mostly while I was on the road trying to elect a president.  At a time when everybody said one day Barack's gonna be president, just not now, its Hillary's [Hillary Rodham Clinton] turn. She has the name, she has the party, she has the money and we had this very small team, of very dedicated people.  And the one thing that kept us in that race early on was that he was raising the money, and he was not raising the money from traditional sources.  He was raising the money from people all around the country in sums that nobody believed that an African American candidate running for president would raise.  And he was getting the crowds everyplace he went.  He was getting the crowds.  I remember early on in, in March of 2007 he did the Pettus Bridge march, across the Pettus Bridge [Edmund Pettus Bridge].  And we were down in Alabama in Selma, and we're in the church [Brown Chapel A.M.E. Church] and he gives a speech.  And we come out of the church. There's no [U.S.] Secret Service, there's no security, there's three of us, and Barack Obama.  And people are pulling on him, and I am and Mike Strautmanis [Michael Strautmanis] who is now [HistoryMaker] Valerie Jarrett's dep- chief of staff are standing there.  We are the security (laughter) for Barack Obama standing outside with Reggie Love his body person.  And he gets up on top of a milk crate and he's screaming across the street in the housing project, "What you all barbequing over there," you know.  And it's just an amazing, amazing time that here is this person who whether we are in Selma, Alabama or an all-white community on the other side of Alabama people are just clamoring for him.  We are in a car driving through an all, an all-white community people are banging on the car screaming, "Barack, Barack, Barack."  And he said, "I remember when a brother could just drive into town and nobody would even pay attention."  And we knew something amazing was happening.
Story_ID: 639081
Speaker 1: We were talking about your association with the Barack Obama [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama] campaign.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And you, you just talking about coming back from--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --being in Alabama. What other things did you do during the campaign?
Speaker 2: I--my title was senior advisor; I did just about anything we need to get done particularly as it related to the African American outreach leadership unions, women all around the country.  Building contingency, and supporting and during the primary, we had a, David Plouffe was a campaign manager and David Plouffe was focused.  That this was a campaign that was not the campaign that, that everyone expected to win and so we, he stayed focused on Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina.  And if we could come out of those first four primaries winning, particularly coming out of Iowa as the first, that we could win the election.  And he, I remember we, I go into his office and ask him about something, he said, "Tell me what this has to do with Iowa," (laughter), "Nevada, South Carolina and New Hampshire?"  And he kept us all focused on that and my responsibility during that period was doing outreach to those constituencies: women, people of color, working with our faith team.  Doing a lot of speaking. Serving, serving as a surrogate explaining who Barack Obama was, as somebody who knew him to people who might never have an opportunity to meet him, to get them comfortable enough with this person that would actually vote for.  And so that's what, I, I spent a lot of time doing and, and coming out of Iowa, we were in Iowa I, I remember driving around icy Iowa highway.  Going from teeny tiny town to teeny tiny town, from NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] dinner to Urban League [National Urban League] dinner to ensuring that the base would come out and support him.  Because the campaign was a campaign of the entire Democratic voter population and those that could move from the Independent group.  But you can never ignore your base, and so you, it's, it's a responsibility that you have, people who understand how to talk to your base.  And how to outreach base and explain your narrative to them, so that even if they don't see you or touch you that they remain connected to you and they come out and vote for you.  So I spent a lot of time doing that.  I went to a lot of churches and after in South Carolina where I, I got up and spoke for them.  And I remember there was a USA Today piece that had a blurb in it about the, the campaign in churches the weekend before the South Carolina primary.  And they talked about how Vernon Jordan [HistoryMaker Vernon E. Jordan, Jr.] was there, but [HistoryMaker] Ertharin Cousin who nobody knew got a bigger standing ovation than Vernon Jordan 'cause she was representing Barack Obama.  And Vernon and I got a good laugh out of it, but it was that kind of a campaign. It was as close to from our community standpoint in those towns as close to a movement as we could come.  And close to a movement as we came to Harold Washington or Jesse Jackson [HistoryMaker Reverend Jesse L. Jackson].  And that's a big part of the story that doesn't get told when people talk about the Obama campaign, that yes we did outreach to Independent voters.  And I did a lot of that, and yes we did outreach to women who came out and voted for him in, in record numbers from Independents as well as Democratic voters.  But it's the African American woman from the projects in Las Vegas [Nevada] who stood in line for four hours on the first day of early voting.  And I walked up to her and said, "You've been in line long," and she said, "No baby, this isn't long, it wasn't long at all."  And it was those people who solidified our base, who were our base and that he captured.  And I did a lot of work to help make that happen.
Story_ID: 639082
Speaker 1: So you were there on at the inauguration standing in the cold with the 2 million other people.
Speaker 2: I had the best seat in the house at the inauguration.
Speaker 1: I was in the cold (laughter).
Speaker 2: I was in the cold too where we, if you were there you were in the cold now (laughter) because it was cold.  I came back after the election and went back to Washington [D.C.] and did congressional support for the inauguration to ensure that all the members of [U.S.] Congress were taken care of during the entire inaug- inaugural week.  And then on Election Day I worked with the Illinois delegation to ensure that we got all of them on the platform.  We actually seated the entire Illinois--we had an Illinois delegation that included everybody from speaker of the house [Michael Madigan], Lisa [Lisa Madigan], all of the elected officials in the State of Illinois, the mayor, the county board president, et cetera.  Then they were on the platform and so ensuring that they got onto the platform, and then by that time, we realized that that great seat, those tickets that we had that were right down in front, there was no way we were gonna get to those seats.  And so somebody said, "Let's watch it on television." I said, "We did not work it this hard," (laughter), "to sit in the Capitol [U.S. Capitol, Washington, D.C.]." 'Cause we were in the Capitol to watch on television.  So we walked all the way up and if you remember where Yo-Yo Ma was playing above where Barack Obama [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama] spoke, that's where I was sitting when he took the oath of office.  And so I was able to see that entire mass of people and it was coming full circle.  Because in 2004 when he did his speech at the Democratic National Convention [2004 Democratic National Convention, Boston, Massachusetts], I was standing on the platform in the media area against the wall.  And I was able to read his teleprompter and see the crowd out in front of him as he talked about one America and red states versus and we couldn't be red states versus blue states, and the response that he got from that crowed.  And so in 2009, '8 [2008], '9 [2009] when he's standing on platform being sworn in as president of the United States again I'm standing right behind him, overlooking his shoulder.  As he is reaching out to that crowd to become president of the United States, so it's been an amazing ride, an absolutely amazing ride.
Story_ID: 639083
Speaker 1: Okay so, you win the election. Now, you get into your current position. How did that happen?
Speaker 2: It's even better than that.  We were at the convention and, and it's at this point where each of the campaigns, both the Republicans and the Democrats have transition teams, leaders.  And you're saying if you win, your--what will your government look like?  You actually start planning it at the time of the convention; each of the parties has so much money and that they receive in order to do this, so that you have a smooth transition of power.  And I was asked by one of the transition leaders if, wh- , "If he wins." I said, "When he wins," they said, "If he wins, come on Ertharin [HistoryMaker Ertharin Cousin], what do you want to do?"  I said, "You know I've worked in Washington [D.C.]. I have a business [Polk Street Group, LLC, Chicago, Illinois]. I'm going to go back to my business and try to salvage what's left of it."  I said, "But there's one job I want, just one," and I described this job, because I was very well aware of it.  Because this is what I do is hunger relief and food security, so I know these issues and what are the org- the, the, who are the leaders in the global community who work on this issue.  And this position had been held by George McGovern former senator and candidate for president, and Tony Hall [Tony P. Hall] during the Clinton [President William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton] administration former congressman, I said that's the job I want.  And they were like, "Okay," (laughter) and they wrote it down.  And so we go through the inaugural, we go through the, through the transition he, we, they start putting people in office.  And Pete Rouse who was one of the senior advisors to the president calls me and says, "Are you interested in being on the BIFAD?"
Speaker 1: Tell us that--
Speaker 2: And I'd, I said, "Pete" (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) what is that acronym.
Speaker 2: The board, the Board for International Food and Agricultural Development, which is the board that I served on at the end of the Clinton administration.  I said, "Pete, I've done that already, why would I do that?" I said, "Does that mean I can't have the position that I wanted?"  I didn't hear anything back from for a while.  And he comes back to me and he says Secretary Clinton [Hillary Rodham Clinton], who had been named secretary of, secretary of state is, is instrumental in all of the foreign affairs positions.  I said, okay, Cheryl Mills is her chief of staff. Cheryl Mills had been the deputy counsel in the White House when I was White House liaison [to the U.S. Department of State].  And I said fine and I called Cheryl, and I said, "So this what I wanna do," and she said, "Oh my god, I never thought about that."  She says, "You're perfect for that job." But the challenge was that there were of course lots of other candidates who were either former members of [U.S.] Congress or people who were very intre- who had a lot more name recognition than [HistoryMaker] Ertharin Cousin, but [HistoryMaker] Valerie Jarrett, Pete Rouse, Cheryl everyone who thought about it as a, as, as who would have conversations about this would say, "God there is really nobody better for this than you."  And so they went in and talked to the president about it and he said, "Sounds like a good idea to me," and he and Hillary Clinton decided that it was a good idea.  And I became the president's nominee, after lots of you know the, of course you need to make sure that the politics is right.  And you have the right conversations with other people who very much interested in doing it.  But people began to agree that with my background that I was right candidate.  And so after a very long and difficult vetting process, all I can tell you is if you ever wanna be a presidential appointee in the Obama [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama] administration, make sure you lead a very clean and honest life.  Because they overturned every rock in, including taxes and where you went to college and talking to people from your high school and all the way back. It was quite amazing.  But in very seriously after reviewing credentials the, the one after another everyone agreed this is right.  And so after the entire vetting process I was nominated by the president and ultimately confirmed by the Senate to serve.  Dick Durbin was, introduced me at my Senate confirmation hearing and gave one of the nicest, and what he would say most honest, 'cause he, that's what he said to me, recommendations for me to serve in this post and basically told his colleagues in the United States Senate that there was nobody else that was as qualified as me to serve on this post.  So it was an amazing moment and good part about it was my mother [Annie Harris Cousin] was sitting there to hear it all (laughter).  So I was confirmed by the Senate in August of last year and went to post in Rome [Italy] in at the, September the end of September of 2009.
Story_ID: 639084
Speaker 1: Now how hard has it been for you adjusting to life in Rome [Italy]?
Speaker 2: As a person who grew up on the West Side of the City of Chicago [Illinois] when you walk into a room and they say, "Her excellency is here," that took a little bit of getting used to.  It is very, it was, it was difficult adjusting to when you walk into a room everyone stands up, and people do not sit until you sit.  That you know nobody calls you Ertharin [HistoryMaker Ertharin Cousin], you are ambassador. You--I am the United States of America when I'm at post.  When I, when I speak in any of our agencies that we represent, where we represent our, the United States it is not Ertharin speaking, it is the United States of America.  When they call on me, they do not call on Ertharin, they call on the United States of America.  And you become very cognizant of that in every conversation that you have.  Even casual conversations with my colleagues are not casual conversations.  They are seeking to understand the United States' position and they wou- and they are planning a report it back to their capitals.  And so my as, as someone once described my bright and shinning personality I am always very mindful that I need to not be casual because I can't afford it.  My country can't afford it, but the best part about it is that I represent an administration that cares about the issues that I work on.  The president [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama] talked about agricultural development in his, in his inaugural speech.  His very first G8, he led the other members of the G8 to a $22 billion global commitment for food security and agricultural development over the next three years for an investment.  That level of commitment we have not had on these issues for, since the 1980s.  And so I have colleagues, not just from the developing world, but from the donor community who say to me on a regular basis it is so good to have America leading again.
Speaker 1: What, what do you see as the biggest challenges to your job?
Speaker 2: The biggest challenges to my job are also the opportunities of my job; it's America is leading again, so we need to get it right.  People want to know what is the United States going to do.  We have, the president made a commitment at the 2009 G8 Summit [35th G8 Summit] to co- of for financial commitment $3.5 billion from the United States government to support agricultural development in the, across a set of targeted countries.  Living up to that commitment is not just about the president, it's also about the [U.S.] Congress and so if he requests budget, additional budget dollars from the Congress we have to get that authorized and appropriated through the, through the Congress.  And everybody around the world is watching.  And so when the first budget comes out and the, the Congress sets the appropriation at several hundred million dollars, less than the president's mark, the entire global community is watching that.  And if we are not committed, then France says, "You know we're having economic crisis too."  UK [United Kingdom] says, "So are we." So does the Netherlands so leading is a great responsibility, if we, if we step back so will the rest of the world.
Speaker 1: Now I would imagine you have to be the first black woman in this, in a position like this.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah (laughter).
Speaker 1: What kind of reaction do you get from your counterparts in different countries to your?
Speaker 2: It he, the, the again I, it's--I am a body that says United States of America, which is why I wear the flag.  Because I don't them to confuse-- I am not just a black woman in the room; the United States of America just walked again.  And you cannot take that lightly, so the response that I get is always one of, of interest.  I am, I am welcomed into every circle and it has absolutely nothing to do with Ertharin Cousin or Ertharin Cousin as a black woman.  Or Ertharin Cousin as a woman or it has to do with the fact that the United States of America walked into the room.
Story_ID: 639085
Speaker 1: Now was your agency involved in any way with the situation in Haiti?
Speaker 2: Very much so. The World Food Programme is the largest humanitarian hunger relief organization in the world. The United States is the largest donor to the World Food Programme.  So we were the first responders again on, providing food to people in, in Haiti.  And if you remember after the first couple of days, you did not hear people asking about food again.  And it was because the team got it right down there, but the important thing that's happening in Haiti right now is that over six hundred thousand people out of Port-au-Prince [Haiti] moved back into the countryside.  And at the urging of the donor community around the world, many, most Haitians had gotten out of farming and agriculture.  And moved into Port-au-Prince into doing factory work and then you can buy rice cheaper than you can grow rice, and so they weren't farming.  The only way we--that people stay in the rural areas is if we support the agricultural development challenges in rural areas.  And so that's where the Food and Agriculture Organization comes in with ensuring that we get the right seeds, the right plants, the right equipment, technical support that people need as a part of the plan for rebuilding Haiti.  And also the World Food Programme in doing food for work in helping people provide them with food while they continue to plant the, the, the farms.  In anticipation of, of growing a crop that they can sell and, and so that's a big part of the plan for reconstruction of Haiti is agricultural development, as a source of economic growth for Haiti.  So the International Food and Agricultural Development [sic. International Fund for Agricultural Development] which is the lending organization and grants organization for project- rural farming projects, is very much involved in investing in Haiti.  The Food and Agriculture Organization will bring technical capacity and support to the development projects in Haiti.  The agricultural development projects in Haiti is very much involved in the World Food Programme.  Continues to be involved in targeting school feeding programs for young children, nutritional programs for zero to two years old.  And, and lactating pregnant women as well as providing food for work for those who are working in projects for agricultural development in Haiti.

Speaker 1: Is there anything that you've done already that you would have done differently?
Speaker 2: Oh my. If you get to live your life over again, I'd try, would try to do all of it differently.  I wouldn't waste so much time between my, in my teenage years that I feel like I wasted (laughter).  There'd be couple less parties that I probably would've attended.  I would, being in a very serious way though; I think that there is very little that I would've done differently.  I've, I sometimes I wish that I had been more focused in, in my early career.  But I think that a lot of what I learned by being out there and spending lots of time with people who are the people that we now serve helps me serve them better.  So even when I say that, I think that you live a life and, a life like mine is one of the, that has been very blessed.  And I look at all my experiences as opportunities and I think they very much have prepared me for the challenges and the work that I'm doing today.
Story_ID: 639087
Speaker 1: What are some of your let's say hopes and concerns for the African American community?
Speaker 2: We are moving into more and more of a very small global world.  And as we look at emerging nations around the globe and doing economic development for the poorest and the abject poor in developing countries, whether we're talking about Sub-Saharan Africa or Southeast Asia, I continue to worry about those in our communities, who may be left behind.  Because as, as we've seen the kinds of jobs that allowed my parents [Annie Harris Cousin and Julius Cousin], my grandparents to work in and my, their siblings to work in factories and have good lives for their children disappear.  And if we don't educate our population, our young people those kinds of opportunities will not be available to them.  Because the jobs of the future are not, that come, that are located in the United States are knowledge based jobs.  And so we and, and I, I, I don't ever want to focus so much on what I am doing for others that I lose sight of what that needs to be done for us here in this country.  And I will always be an advocate for increased education opportunities and job opportunities.  And training opportunities for those who live in our country who look like me and those who don't look like me who are also being left behind.  Because I don't think that we can continue to afford to be, and we are the global leaders.  That's the one thing that you realize when you have the opportunity to represent this country.  Is that people see us as global leaders, but we can't leave any part of our population behind.
Story_ID: 639088
Speaker 1: How would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: You know it hasn't changed since I was the, the nine year old trying to get baby seals saved.  And it's that I did the ca- work that made a difference. Simple as that.
Speaker 1: And what, what lessons would you, give say to your son [Maurice Cousin], about what you've done and what you see as the important things in life?
Speaker 2: I try all the time to give lessons to my son (laughter) very seriously though.  He, I, what's, what makes me proudest about my son is that he has a caring heart, and even though his goals are very different than my goals, he knows that he cannot live in the is- in isolation from those who live around him.  And that if he makes it and others don't, that it's-- his success will be very hollow, very shallow.  And so the advice that I give is that yes, always be the best that you can be, but always remember, to much who is, who, to those who are given much, much is-you are responsible for doing much.
Story_ID: 639089
Speaker 1: One last thing. It's kind of related to how you want to be remembered.  What would you like your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: My.  I have a, a, number of things that I'd like to accomplish. We have so many challenges in the work that I'm doing now, and one of them, one of the, the most tactical challenges that we have is lack of access to data and information.  Because of lack of technology access into the developed, developing world, and that doesn't mean that everybody in the developing world is going to have an iPhone.  But if we can provide opportunities and access to mobile banking and the means for data transfer and communication of information we can change lives.  And so if in the next year I can and I'm already in the process of working with Google [Google Inc.] and, and Microsoft [Microsoft Corporation] and others to look at how do we use the technology tools that provide us with the quality of life that we have in this country.  To support the very basic needs for that communication and technology, and, and technical capacity building support that is required to move a subsistence farmer to a commercial farmer in Sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia.  And if we're able to do that we will have made leaps and bounds towards building the sustainable market that is required to begin to create a food secure world.
Speaker 1: Is there anything we haven't touched on that you would like to say about your career and your experience?
Speaker 2: You know with the, the one thing that's, that's, that's I, I always find amazing and that I talk to young people about all the time is that you are not limited by where you're born, how you're born, what color you're born. Those are all hurdles, but they can all be overcome, and it's about doing work, being prepared, being blessed and knowing that you don't live in this world alone.  And that you can move forward, not just as an individual but as a community of people.
