She had five brothers and no sisters, so she was the only girl in the family.  And that's how she grew up.
Speaker 1: Okay.  How would you describe her?
Speaker 2: My mother?

So my mother had--in, in those days when she was going back to school is kind of the days where they skipped you in grades a lot so my mother skipped two grades when she was really young.

I actually made a film kind of about my father called 'A Place of Our Own.'  So, I talked to my father much more about his young life, and he really cherished the fact that he grew up in Washington, D.C., literally in the shadow of Howard University [Washington, D.C.] as why he went on to college and became a dentist finally.  You know, he said that he was not interested in going--I mean that's not where he was headed, he, but, you know, being in Washington, D.C., a lot of his friends were going to college and he actually stayed, after high school [Paul Laurence Dunbar High School; Paul Laurence Dunbar Senior High School, Washington, D.C.], he stayed out of college for a year or so, and he saw a bunch of friends in college, you know, he could go walk up to Howard to go to parties and he said, hey, I want to be part of this, too.  At that--at that point, you know, you could work a summer job and make almost enough money to go to college, and that's what he did.

I mean, I know that my mother's people were from Mississippi on both sides of the family.  They both were from Mississippi.  My father's parents [Florence Mills Nelson and Howard Nelson] were from Virginia, but that's, that's, that's about it.  I know--one of the funny things that happened is a couple years ago I, I in doing some research, I came across an, an obituary of my great-grandfather's, one of my mother's grandfathers, one of my great-grandfathers and it's, it was an obituary that was published in the Crisis magazine and it said born a slave in 1857 and that just really--just really knocked me out, you know.

Speaker 2: He moved to Indianapolis [Indiana]--
Speaker 1: To Indianapolis.
Speaker 2: --where their company was based.  They, they decided together to base the company in Indianapolis because Indianapolis was kind of in the middle of country and was a real hub for the railroads so you could get kind of anywhere from Indianapolis and that's how they all ended in Indianapolis.
Speaker 1: And your, your maternal grandmother [Nettie Cox Ransom]?
Speaker 2: I don't know much about my maternal grandmother at all.  I mean, I, I did know her growing up a little bit.

At least when I knew her.  But my grandfather was, worked a series of jobs.  You know, he had jobs as a porter, bartender, different, different types of jobs that he would have.  My father always said that my grandfather was the kind of guy who, who, who kind of wouldn't take a lot of mess from white people, so he would, you know, so his best job was at a port- it was kind of as a porter on the railroads until somebody insulted him and then he got into an argument and would get fired and things like that.  But, you know, he was, he supported his family and, you know, got it all f- you know, my father had two brothers and a sister and they all went through high school [Paul Laurence Dunbar High School; Paul Laurence Dunbar Senior High School, Washington, D.C.], and each one of them got at least some degree of college.

Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.  Do you have any of, you know, any memories of growing up?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I mean I grew up in New York City [New York, New York] in a--in a apartment building, you know, with ten stories and, and, you know, I had--I have two sisters [Lynn Nelson Smith and HistoryMaker Jill Nelson] and a brother [Ralph Nelson], so there were four of us and there were a lot of kids in the apartment building.  And we all kind of, you know, played together, so we had a whole kind of a ready-made crew in the neighborhood that we all kind of hung out with.
Speaker 1: Did you guys play stick ball and those kinds of--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah, we didn't play (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) things in the street?

Speaker 1: What was your family like--family life like?
Speaker 2: Strange.  (Laughter) No, I, I, I, you know, I, my mother [A'Lelia Ransom Nelson] for most of my young life, my mother stayed home, and took care of the--the family.  My father [Stanley Nelson, Sr.] was a dentist and he, he worked.  You know, I didn't see a lot of my father 'cause, you know, he worked really hard and, and I, you know, a lot of times I would go to bed before he came home.
Speaker 1: You mentioned your siblings.  Could you tell us their names?
Speaker 2: I'm sorry, I got an eye itch thing that I had for the last couple of days.  Yeah.  I have an older sister, Lynn Nelson [Lynn Nelson Smith], a young sister, [HistoryMaker] Jill Nelson, and my brother, Ralph [Ralph Nelson], is four years younger.

Story_ID: 339746
Speaker 1: You had mentioned that you lived in an apartment building with all the kids.  What--which part of New York [New York] did you grow up in?
Speaker 2: We grew up in Manhattan [New York].  We grew up in what's called Washington Heights [New York, New York] now, then it was just another part of Harlem [New York, New York].
Speaker 1: I see.  What was growing up in Harlem like?  Did you really--
Speaker 2: I mean growing up, I mean, you know, it was the only life I knew so, you know, but I really liked it 'cause, you know, I think that things were a little bit safer than they are now.  You know, we would, you know, my mother [A'Lelia Ransom Nelson] would, you know, on Saturdays and Sundays would, you know, kick us out of the house at nine [o'clock] or ten o'clock and say, you know, "See you at lunchtime."  Kick us out at lunch and say, "See you at dinner."  You know, and that was how our days went.  So, you know, and then when I got a little older when we, we would go to school on the subway and the buses and, you know, New York was kind of like a playground 'cause, you know, it was easy to get around so that, you know, at a early age, you know, I think we were probably--I was probably going to school with my--with my sisters [Lynn Nelson Smith and HistoryMaker Jill Nelson] and younger brother [Ralph Nelson].  We were probably going, you know, to school by ourselves when I was like seven or eight, you know, on the subway and the bus 'cause, you know, we'd just kind of hang together and then we'd meet together after school and we'd all come home together.  So, you know, we were kind of on our own in some ways, you know, in this huge city at our early age and, you know, it was fun.
Story_ID: 339747
Speaker 1: Are there any sights or smells or sounds that when you come in contact with them, it instantly takes you back to childhood [in New York, New York]?
Speaker 2: No, I don't--I don't think so.  It's more--I, you know, I, I get more of that feeling from holidays.  I remember Halloween, you know, because we would just--we could just, we would just, trick-or-treat in our building because it was so big, you know.  So we could just start, you know, from the top and work our way down to the bottom and, you know, and that was-that was trick-or-treating for us, you know, and Thanksgiving.  My mother [A'Lelia Ransom Nelson] was, was, was big on holidays and, you know, was a great cook and would make a big deal out of Thanksgiving and Christmas and cook, you know, a huge turkey and pies, and cakes and whole cookies and that whole kind of stuff.  So it was a big deal.
Speaker 1: She was a great baker?
Speaker 2: Yes, she was a great baker (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Story_ID: 339748
Speaker 1: Do you have any other memories about growing up?
Speaker 2: Not really.  Yeah, you know, I, I went to private school all my life which was, you know, I guess, something that was little bit different.  You know, my parents [A'Lelia Ransom Nelson and Stanley Nelson, Sr.] made that decision early on that, you know, the schools--the neighborhood public schools were not that great and that we would go to private schools.  So, all my life I kind of had two lives.  I had one life, you know, in, in, in the private school and I also the other life kind of in the neighborhood and, you know, that, that was just how, how our lives were.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Could you tell us the name of your elementary school and where it was located?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I went to school--sorry.
Speaker 1: That's okay.
Speaker 2: I went to school in Manhattan [New York].  I went to a private school called New Lincoln, the New Lincoln School [New York, New York] and I went there from when I was four years old in kindergarten until I graduated high school.
Speaker 1: Oh, (unclear).  Was it an integrated school?
Speaker 2: It was an integrated school.  It was what they call progressive, it was a very progressive school.  The school no longer exists.  It merged with another school and then they merged another school.  But it was--it was part of a core group of, of, of what they call progressive education.  So, it was integrated, but, you know, in those days, and still it's pretty much still true to these, these days, you know, integration for, for private schools means that you might have three, four black kids out of twenty.  You know, that's integration.  You know, you never find, or very rarely find, a school that's, you know, 50 percent black when they talk about integrated public schools.
Story_ID: 339749
Speaker 1: Were there any teachers there [New Lincoln School, New York, New York] that influenced you?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I had a teacher when I was in second grade called Mr. Swan [Arthur Swan] and he's--he really influenced me and kind of--you know, you know, I credit with kind of saving my life.  I mean I was like--I, you know, I think was, I was struggling with a lot of different things, you know, and, and, and race being one, one of them that was kind of, you know, you know, I didn't know what to make of it in this school, and, you know, and I was really rebelling and kind of, you know, a class troublemaker, clown and, you know, and also was just kind of acting out. And I don't know for whatever reason, Mr. Swan, who was white, you know, he just kind of made me his pet project and, you know, instead of throwing me out of class, he just worked with me and he made me feel like I was, you know, I was smart, you know.  That, that's what he did, really.  He made like I was smart and he would work with me, you know.  My handwriting was really bad.  I'm left handed and my handwriting was really bad and he just really, you know, worked with me a lot and he was kind of a funny guy.  He was one of those, you know, just those kind of great teachers who would, you know, make up a song for I before E except after C, you know, and that would be a whole song--he would dance around the room and stuff.  And, you know, I don't know, he just made me kind of change my attitude towards school and towards, towards me feeling like I had to be this rebel and this, this disrupter to feeling more than I could, you know, be part of it and that, that, that I could do well in it and, and get the same kind of satisfaction that I could get from disrupting class.
Story_ID: 339750
Speaker 1: You said that you were--attended the school [New Lincoln School, New York, New York] from kindergarten all the way through high school (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Were you--everybody was in the same building?  Were there separate buildings, or--?
Speaker 2: There were two buildings.  So, there was one building that you went in--that, that you were in until you were in second grade, and then there was another building at third grade all the way through high school.  One building.
Speaker 1: Really?
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: That's unusual.
Speaker 2: It's kind of unusual, but not unusual for New York [New York].  For New York private schools.  There's a lot of private schools in New York.  There are some here, too, that, that kind of go all the way through and that's kind of one big school.
Speaker 1: Was it a large school?
Speaker 2: No.  No, there were--there were maybe f-, there were two classes for each grade and as you got older.  So my graduating class there were about forty kids in my graduating class of high school.  Um-hm.
Story_ID: 339751
Speaker 1: Were there any other teachers that influenced you besides your second grade teacher [Arthur Swan] in high school [New Lincoln School, New York, New York]?
Speaker 2: Not really.
Speaker 1: No?
Speaker 2: No, and I kind of just coasted through high school.  I mean, I really wasn't that into it.  I really wasn't that not into it, you know.  You know, I was much more into sports, you know, I played basketball and soccer and stuff like that.  But, you know, I, I think that one thing that it did was it was--it was a, you know, I mean some of the--some of the kids that I graduated high school with, I started with when I was four.  You know, so it was almost like we were a family, you know, and, and it's a very different atmosphere in those--in those private schools and some of it still exist where, you know, like if you're going from third to fourth grade, your third grade teachers would have a series of meetings with the fourth grade teachers and tell them about you and so it was almost like, you know, when you, you got into the next grade everybody knew who you were.  They knew about you, they knew kind of, you know, how to deal with you and not in a bad way, you know.  It wasn't like okay, he's a troublemaker.  It was like these are the things that you have to watch out for.  This is where he's strong, this is where he's not so strong.  So it was really much, much more, you know, kind of a family, almost like a, you know, a family and a lot of the teachers that were there were there for long periods of time, you know, and also because there were four people in my--four kids in my family, you know, which was in, in, in those days--and now even more so--it was a large family, you know.  We were kind of known in the school because all four of us went there.
Story_ID: 339752
Speaker 1: Do you remember any of your friends from sch- from the school [New Lincoln School, New York, New York]?
Speaker 2: Sure, I remember all of them.  I mean, it's something that, that, that, you know, really, I really remember really well and, and a lot of people I really remember really well.
Speaker 1: Can you tell us about some of them?
Speaker 2: Well my best friend, you know, from--I don't know third, fourth, fifth grade on was a guy name Rafael Guzman [ph.], who was Puerto Rican and he was my, my best friend in school.  You know, all the way through high school.  We were kind of just like, you know, a team.  We were very close.  He passed away, I don't know, about ten years ago.
Story_ID: 339753
Speaker 1: You had mentioned you were in sports.  What kind of sports did you take part (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, I did--we did, you know, I was on the basketball team and soccer team but again, you know, I was on a--I went to a school [New Lincoln School, New York, New York] where there were only, you know, maybe 160 kids in high school, so, you know, to be on the basketball team didn't mean that I was particularly good, you know, it just meant that I wanted to be on the team and but, you know, it was--it was still a big deal to us to play basketball and soccer.  I think that was the only, only teams that we had actually, competitive teams were basketball and soccer.
Speaker 1: Did you take part in any other extracurricular activities?  The choir or any (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Not really.  We didn't really didn't have a lot of extracurricular activities in that school, you know, it's my memory but no, and I probably wouldn't had done it if they had, you know.  It just was a--it's kind of like playing basketball.
Story_ID: 339754
Speaker 1: When you were not in school, what were some of the other things you did?  Were you in Boy Scouts [Boy Scouts of America]?  Did you--?
Speaker 2: Nope.  I was never in Boy Scouts, never in anything like that.  We just didn't do those kind of things (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) No Little League?
Speaker 2: --when I was a kid.  Partially--we--it just looks--you know, I, I was thinking about that now, you know, 'cause my kids are playing soccer and baseball and stuff.   But first it was really different because my mother [A'Lelia Ransom Nelson] was really--my father [Stanley Nelson, Sr.] was never around and so my mother was kind of managing four kids.  So for her to say, you know, for her to--she just--there was no way she was going to take me to soccer, you know, and, you know, and do what with the rest of the kids, you know, so we didn't do a lot of those kind of individual extracurricular activities or, or a lot of that individual lessons and things like that.  We did a few but, you know, it was main--it was--like I did ice skating for a while because there was this whole thing where this guy would come and pick you up from school and you pay them some money and they would take over five or ten kids ice skating or whatever.  You know, once every week or once every two weeks.  So I did that for a little while, although I didn't really like it that much, but I did it.  But we just, you know, that was--that was my mother's theory of, of (laughter) childrearing, you know, we didn't seem like (unclear), you know, we didn't do a lot of those things just because there was no time, and the logistics of it would, would have been really difficult.  Again, here we were in New York [New York], we didn't--in New York City, we didn't have a car, you know, for most of my life, you know, we were traveling around on buses and subways.  So, you know, we did a lot of hanging out with the kids in the building.  Hanging out with my other family members.
Story_ID: 339755
Speaker 1: Was church important to your family, did you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, we didn't--no, my family did not go to church at all, ever.
Speaker 1: Oh really?
Speaker 2: No.  We, we were not in, based in church at all.  My father [Stanley Nelson, Sr.] said that, you know, the Christian church was one of the worst things that ever happened to black people.  We never went to church.  I didn't go to church once as a kid, not one time.  I'm one of the only black people you ever talked to who never went to church, not once.
Story_ID: 339756
Speaker 1: When you were young, what were your dreams and aspirations?  What did--how did you see yourself when you grew up?
Speaker 2: When I was young, you know, I mean through that--I was--I was just like a natural kid.  I just went through the phase that everybody wants to go--every kid goes through.  This is my day.  You know, I mean, I was born in '51 [1951].  I wanted to be cowboy, you know, until I was ten then I wanted to be a basketball player, you know, and that was about it, you know.  I mean, you know, I still think that, that my dream job would be playing in the NBA [National Basketball Association].  I can't think of a better job on earth, you know, then, then, then that.  I mean that's still would be--if I, you know, if I had to do (laughter) if I had my pick of what I would be, that'd probably--still probably be it.
Story_ID: 339757
Speaker 1: So you graduated from high school [New Lincoln School, New York, New York], and then you went--did you go away to college, or did you work (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right from high school I went to--I went to college, I went to a school called Beloit [Beloit College] in Beloit, Wisconsin.  The reason why I went there was because they had a--they had a program, it was kind of like this work-study program where after, after your first year you could--you had a certain number of semesters that you had to spend on campus, you had a certain number of, of semesters that were vacation and you had a certain number semesters that were work-study and you could kind of arrange those in any way you wanted as long as you didn't do--you couldn't do more than two of anything in a row.  So you couldn't take like five vacation.  You could take two vacation, two work-study, two--okay, you had to mix them up, and so I went there at first, but I couldn't stand it there.  I couldn't--I just didn't--couldn't stand the winter.  I, you know, if I had it to do over again I probably just would have stuck it out, but I ended up going to--to I think six different colleges.
Speaker 1: Six different colleges?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I, I decided that I would have my own work-study program, and I did my own thing.
Speaker 1: So after you went to the first one, then you went--?
Speaker 2: Let's see, I can give you the whole list--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and that way you can ask me questions one by one.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I went to Beloit, then I went to NYU [New York University, New York, New York], then I went to Morris Brown [Morris Brown College, Atlanta, Georgia], Atlanta University [Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia], then I went to Hunter [Hunter College, New York, New York]--no, then I went to City College in New York [City College of New York, New York, New York]--then I went to Hunter in New York, then I went back to City College in New York (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: That's how I did it.  Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So mostly you were in schools in New York City [New York, New York]?
Speaker 2: Half and half.
Speaker 1: Hunter--half and half.
Story_ID: 339758
Speaker 1: How did you enjoy Morris Brown [Morris Brown College, Atlanta, Georgia]?  What--was that another cultural shock?
Speaker 2: I didn't--that was a cultural shock.  Morris Brown was a cultural shock.  Morris Brown was--I had an aunt who, who taught there and a--great aunt or something like that, second cousin or one of those things, distant relative and she, you know, said, "Why don't you come on down here?" because I didn't know what I wanted to do.  And I ended up going.  I ended up going to school there.  I, I only lasted like one, one semester.  That was kind of my modus operandi, I'd go like one, one semester, but I really wasn't that serious about college at all.  I mean, I didn't know what I wanted to do.  I, I, I, I kind of knew that I wanted to--at first, you know, this is during Vietnam [Vietnam War]--at first I wanted to, to stay in--'cause I wanted to stay in, out of the draft and then when they had the lottery system rather than the draft, I didn't have to stay in.  I, I, I--something in me just, just knew that if I dropped out of college, I might never go back.  So I really felt that it was, you know, in the back of my head I knew that it was essential for me to kind of stay in college even if I didn't do well in college.  You know, I didn't care about college.  I knew that it was really important for me not to get out 'cause I think that, that what happens to so many people is once you get out, you get a job then you, you're, you know, you start making money and that becomes your life.  And so I really, I really knew that that--I wanted to find wha- find out what, what I wanted to be.  So I had a--so I just kind of stayed in college although I, I really wasn't serious about it at, in any way.
Story_ID: 360523
Speaker 1: You had mentioned that you had attended six colleges.
Speaker 2: Six--I'm proud of it.  Yes.
Speaker 1: Six (laughter).
Speaker 2: Very proud of that.
Speaker 1: And Morris Brown [Morris Brown College, Atlanta, Georgia] was cultural shock and, but before you went there you had gone to NYU [New York University, New York, New York]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, um-hm (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right?  And what--can you tell us something about your, your time at NYU?  What were your, what, what ki- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I, I, I only went to NYU for a--I went down to NYU for a term, also.  And I just, you know, it, it--
Speaker 1: Were you taking just basic classes while you were there?
Speaker 2: I think, I think, I was taking basic classes.  I think, I think that what, what happens, you know, what I didn't understand is, is, is once you--once you transfer colleges, you know, it's kind of like you're dropped down from outer space into the middle of, of nothing, so, you know, being from New York [New York], I would take the subway there, I didn't know anybody there, you know, so you--so I didn't have those, you know, orientation sessions that you have.  You know, those kind of get-to-know each other sessions, whatever those were.  You know, I kind of had my friends from high school [New Lincoln School, New York, New York] and people I had known in New York that I would hang out, out with.  So and, and so it was kind of attending a series of classes there and I still, it still wasn't the kind of college life or, or college thing that I was looking for.  Although I don't know exactly what that would have been.  I mean, I, I don't think it was in any way any of the colleges' fault that I left.  I mean, I just really wasn't, you know, I wasn't ready for college--not that I wasn't ready or, or, yeah, I wasn't ready, maybe I was more than ready.  But, you know, coming and growing up in New York City and, and, and such, you know, in some ways going to college seemed like kind of a step backwards.  You know, because I, I, you know, I had a whole lot of freedom by the time I graduated high school.  You know, I mean I could, you know, I could take the subway and go wherever I wanted, you know, after school and, you know, just do whatever I kind of wanted to do and to be kind of stuck on a college campus as I was in Beloit, Wisconsin [at Beloit College] or Morris Brown, you know, where you couldn't get around, living in a dorm--it was just very different for me and, and I, I don't think I was exactly ready.  And you know, and, and again this is, you know, we're talking about 1969, 1970 when the, you know, the whole world was in upheaval and, and, you know, we really felt that none of this mattered because, you know, in, in, you know, in twenty years the whole world was going to be different and none of this--none of this, you know, had any relevance to what the world was going to become.  And, you know, we really, you know, I really felt that and so did a lot of other people who were young at that time.
Story_ID: 360524
Speaker 1: So the '60s [1960s], you were at the end of the '60s [1960s], and this is Vietnam War and so you went to--you were in school to, to stay out of the war. Is that--at first, um-hm (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) At first.  Well, at first but also 'cause I didn't know what else and, you know, and my parents [A'Lelia Ransom Nelson and Stanley Nelson, Sr.]--
Speaker 1: Were you working?  Did you have a job?
Speaker 2: My parents had the money to pay for it.  No, I didn't have a job most of the time.  I think maybe when I was in NYU [New York University, New York, New York] I might have had some kind of part-time job, but most of the time I didn't have jobs.  You know, I mean my parents had--I, I, I, I got a scholarship to Beloit [Beloit College, Beloit, Wisconsin].  I think I was on some kind of a scholarship to Beloit but after that they were basically paying.  But, you know, when you're young you don't really think about that or I didn't.  You know, I didn't think about the--what it was costing my parents.  I didn't really care, you know, that much, you know, because my parents, you know, and we were very middle class--my father was a dentist, you know.  So it wasn't something that, that was really concerning me.  The, the cost of it and, and, and, you know, I was very lucky.  I mean, I realized that, you know, look I, I, I had the opportunity to kind of bounce around and find myself and it's an opportunity that most people don't have--most African American people don't have and it's--it, it, it--in some ways it's a difference.  I know it made a difference in my life.
Story_ID: 360525
Speaker 1: What school did you graduate from?
Speaker 2: I graduated from City College [City College of New York, New York, New York].
Speaker 1: From City College.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And this period (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) In New York [New York].
Speaker 1: --how, how long was this period of time?  Was it four years that you went to six schools?
Speaker 2: No, no, no.  I graduated in 1976, I believe, and I started in '69 [1969].  So, I probably went to school for seven or eight years, rather than four.  And all of that time I was in college, I was enrolled in college, for every minute of that time.  When I finally graduated from City College, I finally--the reason of why--the only reason of why I graduated from City College was I kind of had this interest in filmmaking, you know, that was kind of, you know, I, I, I mean, what happened to me in college was that I realized that I didn't want to sit behind a desk.  I didn't want to carry a briefcase.  You know, they would tell me when I was in high school [New Lincoln School, New York, New York] that I, you know, you can argue good, you'd make a good lawyer.  But I didn't--I mean I didn't want to be a lawyer.  I realized what, what being a lawyer actually was, you know, they had those big books and stuff; I didn't want to read that stuff. And I didn't want to be a lawyer and, and, and, you know, I realized I kind of liked the art--artistic side of life.  I mean, my, my, you know, my father [Stanley Nelson, Sr.], you know, was a dentist who worked for himself.  He had his own office.  And so that was the model that I saw.  You know, I mean, you know, I didn't grow up around somebody who had a nine to five job, who went to work and worked for somebody else and had a boss.  I mean, and I never thought about this until, until afterwards, but that was the model that I knew.  So, you know, the idea of getting a job, a good job working for somebody else was really--I just really wasn't directed towards that.  It just wasn't--to me that wasn't something that, that, that felt like, you know, that's the right thing to do.  So anyways, as I was in, as I was going through college, you know, I realized that, that I wanted to really do something artistic maybe that, you know, those were the cool people.  You know--you know, and that, you know, a job where, you know, you don't have to go to an office, a job where you can wear what you want.  An office where you, I mean, a job where you can, you know, make your own hours and be your own boss.  That, that became something that was import- important to me so I looked around for--you know, what can I do that, that, that's, that's artistic.  How can I be part of this kind of artistic community?
Story_ID: 360526
Speaker 1: I didn't have a lot of artistic inclination.  I was not kind of an artistic type of person.  I couldn't draw, I couldn't play an instrument, I couldn't--you know, I wasn't going to be a great ballet dancer, you know--
Speaker 2: Couldn't sing (laughter).
Speaker 1: I couldn't sing, I didn't show any kind of, you know, I wasn't a writer (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You couldn't act (laughter).
Speaker 1: I couldn't act.  I could, could act a little bit, but I didn't want to be an actor.  You know, I mean, I'd end up being an actor and, you know, waiting, going to auditions and, you know, and then, and then I would--that was--this was still at a time, 1969, '70 [1970], '71 [1971] in there where there's not a lot of black actors around who are making, you know, big money, you know, or, or making a living even.  You know, and, and I didn't want to do that and so and, I, you know, I had always kind of thought and I even thought, you know, the idea of filmmaking like, like had appeal, had kind of intrigued me.  But I think, you know, no more than most people.  You know, I mean, I think, you know, everybody's intrigued pretty much by movies and it, but it, it appealed to me a little bit, I mean, I'd gotten a Super 8 camera when I was like thirteen or fourteen--I, I'd maybe shot two rolls of film and then I forgot about it.  You know, wasn't like I was Steven Spielberg or George Lucas, one of those guys who, you know, gets a camera when they're twelve and starts making films, you know, all through high school.  I didn't do that.  But I, you know, as I said, you know, let me--let me try to take a film class at some point, you know, and see.  And partially I think I was pushed by this was, you know, by now we're in like the early '70s [1970s] and there's this era--this blaxploitation era where suddenly, you know, there's these films being made about black people and to a lesser extent by black people, so that's happening and, you know, and, and so these new possibilities are opening up.  And I took a film class and I kind of liked it and so I started taking film classes.
Story_ID: 360527
Speaker 1: At this point my father [Stanley Nelson, Sr.] was getting bored with my whole act of going to these schools and paying for it, and so he said--so I got him to pay for this summer course that NYU [New York University, New York, New York] has.  And so I went back to NYU to this summer course that they have which is open to everybody.  It's not, you know, it's like you pay your money, you can go.  It's not really--you're not really part of the college.  It's like this, they call it like the summer filmmaking intensive, or something like that and you go for six weeks or something like that during the summer and you go, you know, from nine [o'clock] to five [o'clock] every day.  You go and you make films and you talk about filmmaking.  I went to that and that was the first thing I did and I was really intrigued by it and I, you know, liked it.  It was fun, you know, go out with a camera and shoot and I, and I liked to watch movies and stuff.  So I really liked that.  Then--and so then I went--I went to Hunter [Hunter College, New York, New York] because Hunter College is part of the CCNY, City College of New York [New York, New York] system so it's part of the, the system of colleges in New York [New York] which at that point were, were damn near free.  You know, you cou- you know, you could--they were--they were almost free, you know.  And so I--and actually you could get student loans and other things and actually make money out of going to school.  So I did that.  Got a loan and I went to, to Hunter for a year where I just took classes, and then I found out that City College was starting a film school.  Was just starting, was just starting this film school.  They had gotten a guy named Aaron Davis or Leonard--Leonard Davis had given them this huge amount of money to start an art school and part of the art school was going to be a film school.  And so I applied to that and got into the Leonard, Leonard Davis Center for the Performing Arts, which was a film school.  And that's kind of what, what got me out of school and how I--how I really got into film and also what got me out of college 'cause the Leonard Davis Center for the Performing Arts was a two-year program and so each--every term you would--you would, it was all set out what you would take and you would, but you would get sixteen credits every seme- every semester so, you know, you got--and it was two years so I ended up after that two years getting sixty-four credits, which was, which at that point I had more credits than I needed to graduate college.  And the dean called me--I'll never forget--he told me I was a quasi-grad, which meant that I had enough credits to graduate college, but I didn't have the right credits.  So I had to go back for a half a semester and take science and something else.  Science and math, I think, so I could graduate.  So that's what got me out of school (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay, okay.
Speaker 1: That's the only way.  I'd still be in college now if it wasn't for that.
Story_ID: 360528
Speaker 1: You were still interested in learning more about how to make film, so you went to Columbia University [New York, New York], is that right, or you went to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I never went to Columbia.
Speaker 1: You didn't go?
Speaker 2: That's, that's the only school I went to [sic.].
Speaker 1: Really?  Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  I had a fellowship for Columbia a long--
Speaker 1: Fellowship, okay.
Speaker 2: This, this was years later.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Thank you.  Okay.  So what did you do after, after you're out of school, you have this degree [from City College of New York, New York, New York], and I, I assume your father's [Stanley Nelson, Sr.] not going to support you anymore.
Speaker 2: No, no, no. Actually when I was, I was twenty-one my fath- my father took me out to dinner and gave me twenty-one dollars and said, you know, "Here's twenty-one dollars.  Here's the last money I'm ever going to give you, you know.  You're now twenty-one, you're on your own."  It didn't quite work out like that but it pretty much did work out like that. But that was about it for support from my father, but.  So anyway my father wasn't supporting me anymore and, you know, I was, you know--you know, but I was from New York [New York], you know, and I, I, I was born and raised in New York and I was still living in New York and I knew how to survive, you know what I mean, I don't remember.  I mean I might--I got on welfare, you know, I knew how to do all that kind--I mean, you know, New York--you know, in those days and probably still, you know, it, it's, you know, it's--it was--it's, it's fairly easy to survive in your home town, your home city.  New York is my home city.  It's a big home city, so I knew how to survive.  So I got on welfare.  My apartment I shared with a guy.  I had this great apartment, the rent was two hundred dollars a month so we each--you know, it was like five bedrooms or four bedrooms or something.  We each split it, you know, so it was a hundred dollars a month each for my apartment, I mean, you know, it was, you know, we got food stamps, you know--you know, but anyway so I was able to survive.  I mean I didn't have a lot of money, but I didn't have a lot of ambition either.  But anyway, so let, let me think--my first job out of school, you know, I got it as a guide that, that, that--that's--that floats around in the industry that, you know, tell--talks about all the different film production companies and things like that.  So I got one of those and I would just go and I would knock on doors and I would say I just graduated from film school, I need a job, I need a job, I need a job.  And I was getting, getting no success and I know it was like my second or third day of just going down the list and, you know, going to different offices and saying, giving them my resume and it wasn't working, you know, I mean there were no black people in these companies and, you know, this was a time, you know--you know, it just wasn't happening.
Story_ID: 360529
Speaker 1: And I remember I called my mother [A'Lelia Ransom Nelson] and, you know, maybe to go see if I could go over there and get a free dinner and she said, "You know, I'm, I'm just reading this article in the Daily News [New York Daily News] about this filmmaker, [HistoryMaker] William Greaves.  It says--it's this profile of this black filmmaker named William Greaves.  You should go see him."  So, I think I called up information, got his number and I was--I was standing in a phone booth like two blocks away from his office.  It's one of those things that, you know, just happens.  I mean, it's one of those things, you know.  I called up my mother, she's reading an article about William Greaves, I'm two blocks from his office, I go knock on his door, and he's there and I start talking to him and, you know, he's like, you know, "I can't, you know, I don't have any work, I don't have any money to pay you," blah, blah, blah.  And this was a time, this was in the early '70s [1970s]--this is probably about '75 [1975], '76 [1976]--'76 [1976] I think it was.  There was a program called CETA, a government program where the thing about the CETA program--it was called some, some--we looked it up the other year.  We cou- nobody could remember what it stood for--something like the Comp-, Comprehensive Education Training Act [sic. Comprehensive Employment and Training Act]--something like that.  It was CETA.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So it was a federal program and the thing about it, what CETA would do was CETA would pay you minimum wage if somebody would agree to hi-, to, to, to train you, then CETA would pay you for a period of time like six months to a year.  You would be paid by the federal government but the person had to agree to hire you at the going rate for that job after that training period was over.  So CETA would pay you for six months to a year and then they would have to hire you, but pay you the going rate for that.  So I said, "Well, Bill--." So anyway I'm in Bill Greaves' office, I knew about this CETA program.  I said, "Bill, you could hire me through CETA.  CETA will pay me for six months, you know, and you don't have to pay me anything for six months.  But after the six months you have to agree to hire me, you know, and I could work for you as an assistant editor and thence you'd have to--but you'd have to hire me as an assistant editor."  And Bill, you know, he was kind of interested, then he said, "Well, I can't agree to hire you, you know, after six months.  There's no way I can agree to hire you."  And I said, "Well, Bill, all you have to do is hire me for a day and then fire me. But, you know, you can, you know, I can work for you for six months for free on this program and you can get--you can get my work for free."  And he said, "Fine, you're hired.  Let's go."  And so he said, "My son, David [David Greaves], is out there getting ready.  We're going to shoot this commercial tomorrow.  You go with David to the equipment office and pick up some equipment and you start tomor- you start right now."  So, that's how I started.  And so I started working for Bill that way and I ended up moving--he had a, he had a house in Massachusetts, kind of couple hours from New York, and I would--I ended up being an assistant editor with Bill and, and lived up on this farm he had with his family for about six months and did sound for him and edited some stuff for him and, you know, worked for him for a couple of years.
Story_ID: 360530
Speaker 1: Could you tell us a little bit more about Mr. Greaves [HistoryMaker William Greaves]?  What were some of the films that he did?  What you've learned from him (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, Bill Greaves was like the, the, the dean of and still is the dean of black documentary filmmakers.  I mean, Bill Greaves--Bill, Bill was an actor.  You know, not too many people know this, but Bill was an actor in some of those early black movies like in 1948 and '46 [1946] and stuff like that.  He actually used a couple of clips of, of him in some documentaries I use when we're talking about old films, so I put him in there just as a joke, you know (laughter), so the clips we use of old black films are ones with Bill in them.  But Bill was like a, an actor and then he wanted to be trained in filmmaking so he went to--and there was no opportunity for that here in the United States, so he went up to Canada and was trained at the Film Board of Canada [National Film Board of Canada] and made some documentaries there then he came back to, to the states and, and, and, and still does have a company [William Greaves Productions] in New York [New York], where he made a number of documentaries and I think he made a couple of features, too.  But a couple of documentaries, he made a film called 'The Fight' [sic. 'The Fighters'], which was a chronicle of one of the Muhammad Ali-Joe Frazier fights.  He made a film about the Harlem Renaissance called 'From These Roots.'  He made a film just a few years ago, oh, what's the guy's name--I am so sorry, I can't remember--this is embarrassing.  What's the, the black guy's name who, who was instrumental in the UN [United Nations]?
Speaker 1: Ralph Bunche.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  He made a film ['Ralph Bunche: An American Odyssey'] about Ralph Bunche couple years ago.  You know, he's made, I don't know, fifty, sixty films and he's, he's--he was the first executive producer of--what's the thing that Tony Brown became famous for?
Speaker 1: I'm not--oh, I know what you're talking about.
Speaker 2: I'm sorry, I can't remember.
Speaker 1: It's a TV show.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  But anyway, Bill was the first executive producer of--this black kind of news magazine show--this was in the '60s [1960s], early '70s [1970s].  You know, he's--
Speaker 1: Tony Brown, 'Tony Brown's Journal.'
Speaker 2: Yeah.  It's not--it wasn't Tony Brown--'Black Journal' it was called.  It was first called 'Black Journal' and Bill Greaves was the first executive producer of that, which was the first time anything like that had been done.  It was a national show, it was kind of a magazine show and a lot of black filmmakers, you know, camera people, producers, directors worked for him under that.  You know, in my generation--there's a whole generation who, like me, and all of us at some point or other, worked for Bill Greaves.  And, and in a lot of ways, you know, owe our start to Bill.  So that's who Bill Greaves was--is and was.
Story_ID: 360531
Speaker 1: So that's how you became involved in the filming documentaries? Is that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.  I, when I was in--when I was in, in, in college [City College of New York, New York, New York], I wasn't interested in documentaries at all.  I was really interested in feature films.  But I, I really got into documentaries just by working with Bill [HistoryMaker William Greaves], you know, that was the job I got.  I mean, there were, you know, the black--what happened was that blaxploitation era of, of feature films was a very short era, and by the time I got out of school that era was almost over, or over, and so I was looking for work and the--and the--and the work that I could find was working with Bill Greaves on documentary films.  And so that's, that's where I started and that's what I became interested in.
Story_ID: 360532
Speaker 1: I mean this may sound very, very elementary to you, and so you might say, why is she asking that question?  I teach elementary school.  Could you tell--because there are some students who will be watching this--the difference between commercial filmmaking and documentary, the whole--are the processes very, very different?
Speaker 2: Well, I mean--I think, you know, in its bare, minimal terms, I mean document-, you know, documentary films are films that do not have actors that do not have scripts where we reading lines and like that, you know, they're, they're films of, of, of real life.  So, you're--you're film- you know, you might have an narrator, but it's not a film where you have a script and an actor and people are, are, are making up this fictional thing, it's that--so that's in its bare terms is what a documentary film is.  You know, you may think also--I mean, this might be a little more complicated than you want to get in to, but also the economics of documentary filmmaking tend to be entirely different from feature filmmaking because, you know, most documentary films don't make money and that's been--that's kind of changed within the last few years, so you have filmmakers, you know, like Michael Moore, who actually does make money off his documentary films, but in general, you know, documentary films don't make money, they're, they're financed by grants or individuals raise money and, you know, like sometimes you can get rich individuals, some people get money from their families, some people make them for incredibly--they make them incredibly cheaply, you know, so either some people make documentary films for five, ten thousand dollars.  It's using your own money and then make a film, or sometimes they're funded by HBO [Home Box Office], or PBS [Public Broadcasting Service] or, you know, The History Channel, A&E [Arts and Entertainment Network], all of those kinds of things, but, usually you know--traditionally, documentary films are not the films that people go to in the theaters and pay money.  Now, there's a lot of documentary films that come out and are in the theaters like the penguin movie, whatever that was called.
Speaker 1: 'March of the Penguins.'
Speaker 2: 'March of the Penguins,' you know, which made a lot of money, but, you know, still even most of the documentaries--films that make it to the theaters, don't make money, but they, they are in theaters.

Speaker 1: How long did you work with Mr. Greaves [HistoryMaker William Greaves]?
Speaker 2: I worked with Mr., Mr. Greaves, Mr. Bill.  I worked with Bill Greaves for probably the first year and a half or so straight, and then off and on for another five years on different projects.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And after that time, you started--did you--you went out on your own, what did you do?
Speaker 2: After that time, I, I got a job working for an organization called United Methodist Communications, which is the communications branch of the Methodist church--the National Method-, the United Methodist church, which is, you know, is a huge organization.  It's not one local church, it's the whole United Methodist church.  So, I got a job working for the United Methodist church.  I know you're looking at me funny 'cause I said before that I never went to church and that's still true.  The first time I ever went to church was when I worked for the United Methodist church, and then I, I earned my place in heaven 'cause I went to church a lot, so.  Now, I broke even.
Speaker 1: How did your father [Stanley Nelson, Sr.] feel about that?
Speaker 2: He didn't care (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) He wasn't paying for anything.
Speaker 2: He didn't care (laughter).  No, and by that time, it didn't matter but, you know, I mean, I'm not a Methodist, I never was, was a Methodist, I still--I still have no religion.  I'm not religious at all, but what happened was, you know, a friend--I was--I was looking--I, I had stopped working for Bill and, you know, I was kind of not, you know, looking for a job more or less and a friend found out that the United Methodist church was looking for somebody.  And their office was four blocks from my house, so I figured, you know, how, how could I not even go there and look for a job.  So I went over there and I applied for this job and I got it.  I worked for them for a long time.  I worked for them a long time.
Story_ID: 360534
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What kind of things did you do?
Speaker 2: Well, we [United Methodist Communications] did everything.  We did everything for the--you know, it was the national (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) The history of the church?
Speaker 2: Well, no.  We did it--we did, you know, we were the--we were the communications out in the Methodist church, so United Methodist--we did everything from radio shows to film strips to movies.  We did, you know, films in Africa, we did films in South America, we did films about, you know, an Indian church out in Window Rock, Arizona, a Korean church in Chicago [Illinois], you know, we did everything.  And, and what was great about--there were a lot things that were great about it.  One, the people were just incredibly nice, I mean, they were just--they were just so nice, and I'm still connected to a lot of the people from there.  They were just really nice, really supportive and really loving people, and, and, you know, we didn't have to raise money, you know, we--the money the was there and so they--we--once a film was decided on which I am not exactly 100 percent how that process worked, but they would decide to make a film and they'd say, "Okay, Stanley [HistoryMaker Stanley Nelson], go research a film.  We want to make a film about, you know, the, the church programs in West Africa," and so, you know, they would send, send us to West Africa for a couple of weeks and we'd come back and we'd propose this idea and then we go back and shoot.  But the money was there, and so, you know, we didn't have to go through this kind of fundraising period.  And it was a job, I was on staff, I had an office, you know (laughter), and I just worked, you know, and so that was great and then the other thing was that I realized early on in, in working with the Methodist church that even though I was making films for the Methodist church, I had to make films that were entertaining that, you know, that conveyed the point that they wanted to convey, you know, if that's church work in, in West Africa, but I also had to make that entertaining.  You know, I had to--you know, these, these were Methodists but they also were Methodists who had TVs, you know, and so they went to movies.  So, you know, they were--everybody's sophisticated now, so you know, you couldn't have this--have a bunch of boring stuff up on the screen, you had to make a film that was entertaining.  So I learned a lot about, about filmmaking and how to make films that, that, you know, had content but also could make that content entertaining.
Story_ID: 360535
Speaker 1: What years were you--did you work with--from about when to when (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I worked with the Methodists [at United Methodist Communications] around, from 19- from about 1978 I think to maybe 1984, '85 [1985] I was on staff, and then when I left, I had an agreement with them--it might have been a little longer--I had an agreement with them where they, they guaranteed me a certain amount of work as a consultant per year for a couple of years.  Then I worked--I did a couple of films for different divisions after I had left, you know, on just--on a freelance basis.  So, up until, I don't know, you know, probably 1995 or so, I still was doing, you know, a little bit of work in every year or two years for them.  I would still do it now, I'm just kind of swamped by other stuff, you know, but if they asked me, I would still do it.
Speaker 1: Why did you leave?
Speaker 2: I left because--I had no reason--I mean, I had just been there a, a--long enough, you know, I had been there a long time.  I really wanted to do overseas work and after, after I had done a fair amount, I promised myself, you know, that after I started doing overseas work, I would leave.  There was a filmmaker there who I greatly respected, but he had been there for like twenty-five or thirty years, you know, and--you know, that was his life.  I mean, you know, couldn't get out, it was a great life I mean, you know, he did films, you know, I mean if you named a country, you know, he had done films in Vietnam, China, you know, all over South America, you know, Brazil, I mean, he had done some everywhere, you know and it was a great life, but I didn't want to do that I, I, I mean I, you know, went into filmmaking to, to, to do something, you know, a little bit bigger and, and, and to plan on, on, on what I thought was a bigger stage.  And I really want to do that and also they were cutting back on the films that I--that I kind of did.  I worked doing films.  I worked--for most of my time there, I worked in a division called public media, which meant that we did films for the general public.  You know, so we did--we did stuff for TV.  We did--we did like those kind of commercials that you see that, that the public service announcements, you know.  You know, we did a lot of that kind of stuff.  So we did films that were more for the public media and they were cutting back on that as this kind of more right wing or, or, or, or what's the word--I would say more--
Speaker 1: Conservative.
Speaker 2: --conservative religious movement kind of filtered in, I mean, in no way did, you know, are Methodists more conservative as a whole, but it, you know, what, what I think conservatives realize is that by putting a bar here, it makes this side of the bar start to filter that way, too.  So,  so the church became slightly more conservative and it just became a little bit dif- more difficult to do what we, what it--what we were doing which was a lot of social action type of films.  We did a lot of--we did a film about that I was really proud of called 'Puerto Rico: Our Right to Decide,' which was about Puerto Rico's decision on whether it would, you know, remain a commonwealth, become a state or become independent.  And those kind of things were, were, becoming harder and harder to do.
Story_ID: 340081
Speaker 1: Okay, so you have decide-, you're making a career move and you left the Methodist church.  What did you do then?
Speaker 2: When I left the Met-, well, the--let's see, somewhere in the beginning of the '80s [1980s] I came up with this idea of doing a film about Madam C.J. Walker because my [maternal] grandfather [Freeman B. Ransom] worked for the company [Madam C.J. Walker Manufacturing Company, Indianapolis, Indiana].  He was left pieces of the company both by Madam Walker and by her daughter, A'Lelia Walker, so that my, my family actually owned a piece of the company, which was pretty much worthless by this point, but, you know, my mother [A'Lelia Ransom Nelson] had been president of the company and such, my uncles--my one uncle was still the general manager of the company, another uncle was--kind of managed the building.  They had this huge building in Indianapolis [Indiana].  So it was a story I had always heard and I had came up with the idea of doing an independent film about Madam C.J. Walker because she was listed in 'The Guinness Book of Records' ['Guinness World Records'].  She was--there was a page and she was listed as the first woman in the world, of any color, to start with nothing and earn a million dollars, and I thought that was kind of a great (unclear).  So I had come up with this idea to make a documentary film ['Madam C.J. Walker: Two Dollars and a Dream'].  An hour-long film about Madam C.J. Walker.  So I wrote a proposal and was circul-, circulating this around and United Methodist Communications, who I worked for, I asked them for some money and they said, "We don't have any money but what we will do we give you one day a week out of your--out of your time that you can work on this film, and so you can have your office, you can use the phones, you can use the copy machines, you can do, you know, whatever you need to do on that one day a week."  So, so I said, "Okay, well Fridays I will work on this."  So Fridays for about a year I was working on trying to get this film off the ground.  And then I, I was able to raise some money and so I left to, to, to work full-time on this film on Madam C.J. Walker, and also to work independently.
Story_ID: 340082
Speaker 1: At that point, you know, I had to learn how to do sound--location sound on documentaries when I was with Bill Greaves [HistoryMaker William Greaves] and I would still get work from time to time during location sound with Bill and other people, and I had learned how to edit 'cause I'd trained with Bill as an assistant editor, and so I was editing my own film ['Madam C.J. Walker: Two Dollars and a Dream'] on Madam C.J. Walker.  And so I left them at the Methodist church [United Methodist Communications], but I also left with a deal where they would--I would work as a consultant and, and so I would work on various projects for them and I think I was guaranteed a certain amount of money like $10,000, $15,000, I forgot what it was exactly per year as a consultant, so they would come to me and say, "We want to make a film about this.  We want--we're going to hire you as director, and we're going to pay you" whatever it would be, you know, $1,000 a week for ten weeks and then that would be my $10,000 that I would make again.  At this point I was single, I'm still living in the same apartment that now the rent might be, you know, $260 a month, and, you know, so I'm able to survive on, on very little.
Story_ID: 340083
Speaker 1: And how was the film received?
Speaker 2: 'Two Dollars and a Dream' ['Madam C.J. Walker: Two Dollars and a Dream']?  The film on Madam Walker [Madam C.J. Walker] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 2: The film of Madam Walker was, was a incredible, incredible success.  You know, this was--I finished it in like 1988 or 1989.  There weren't a lot of films being made--documentary films being made by black people about black people.  And so, it was incredibly received.  It was shown prime time on PBS [Public Broadcasting Service] nine o'clock at night and, you know, all over the country as a national special, and it did very well.  But, I, I learned a lot of great lessons from making that film.  You know, when, when it aired, you know, I was sitting next to the phone, and sitting next to the phone the next day waiting for that offer to come through for the next film and, you know, I might have gotten a couple calls from friends saying hey, congratulations, but I didn't get any calls from anybody else, and I realized that that's not--at least at that point--and still today pretty much, that's not how documentary films work.  You know, you got to figure out, you know, how to--how to go to the next project while you're still working on one project, and you also have to figure out how to pay yourself while you're making the film because so many times on what they call the backend, at the end of a film with documentary films, there is no money that comes in.  So, I made that film and PBS, when I first--PBS first saw it, they--we--they saw it at a film festival.  We had a film festival and I invited PBS and I also invited a ton--it was in New York [New York] so I invited a lot of my friends and family so the crowd went wild when (laughter) when the film ended and PBS said they wanted to show the film and I said, "How much do--are you going to pay?"  And they said, "Well, we don't want to pay you anything at all.  We just want to show the film."  And I was like, "Well, you want to show this film nationally on national television and you don't want to pay me," and they said, "No we don't.  We don't have any money."  Finally, we negotiated that they would pay off my bills, which was like $12,000, something like that, I can't remember, but it was very, very low, but they--I said, you know, "I can't--I can't let you have the film and air the film and still owe the film lab, you know, $10,000. That, that just wouldn't make any sense, and so you've got to pay me enough to pay off the film."  And so they paid me enough to pay off the lab and a couple of other things and pay off my bills so at least I broke even.  And then after that, I realized that, you know, you've got--and, and, and this was a film that I had worked on for seven years, I think.  And, at that point, I realized that, you know, you can't, you know, you can't count on money coming in at the end, that you've got to figure out how to pay yourself while you're making the film.  So, it was a great lesson.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 340084
Speaker 1: It ['Madam C.J. Walker: Two Dollars and a Dream'] won some awards, didn't it?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  It won a bunch of awards, which I forget what they are now.  It won--
Speaker 1: The best production of the decade?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  From, from, from, from, what's it called (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Black Filmmakers.
Speaker 2: --Black Filmmakers, Black Filmmakers Foundation [Black Filmmaker Foundation], right.  It won best production of the year and then also best production of the decade because it came out in '88 [1988], '89 [1989] and then they had this big ceremony because it was their tenth anniversary so they had started in 1980 [sic. 1978] so they voted on the best production of, of, of what they call the decade and it won that award, to my surprise.
Story_ID: 340085
Speaker 1: You did some more films.  What was your next film?
Speaker 2: Well (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You did--go on.
Speaker 2: Well, you tell me.  What was the (laughter)--what was my next film?
Speaker 1: (Laughter) You did something--you did something--you did 'Freedom Bags,' you did 'The Black Press' ['The Black Press: Soldiers Without Swords'].
Speaker 2: Yeah, I did something called 'Freedom Bags' and I, I also did a film called 'Methadone: Curse or Cure,' which is a film about the methadone program.  I did a film called 'Freedom Bags,' which was a film about maids, domestic servants, African American domest-, live-in domestic servants.  You know, the reason why it was hard for me to say what my next film was 'cause all this time I was doing a bunch of other films and I was working doing other people's sound.  I was working doing little, you know, like, what you call industrial films, that like are films for a certain organization, but is not seen by the general public, I did a lot of, you know, things.  I mean, you know, I had learned that, you know, I, I really wanted to survive as a filmmaker, and again, a lesson to me was--just like I didn't want to drop out of college, I didn't want to drop out of the film community, so I didn't do a lot of other work besides making films, so I didn't take a day job or a night job as a night watchman, I didn't take, you know, a job doing something else.  I just was broke (laughter) and stayed making films and, and, you know, would rather go on welfare, you know, and live in a cheap apartment than take other jobs.  But, you know, I mean, I, I lived--I lived fairly well 'cause I, you know, I was able to survive and I--and I was able to always kind of have work to do and I always had a project so that I always had something that was driving me (laughter) so I had the story of Madam C.J. Walker that was, you know, so I wasn't just a bum, I had this film ['Madam C.J. Walker: Two Dollars and a Dream'] that I was trying to do.  After I did that, I had this film on methadone that I was trying to do.  It wasn't like I was just out there.  After I finished that, I did a--I had the film 'The Black Press,' which was a film about African American newspapers, which took me another seven years to do, but I, you know, that's what I was doing so I never had this feeling like I was, you know, incomplete or I was not doing what I was supposed to be doing 'cause I had this project.  I had this thing, now that might have been (laughter) you know, kind of a psychological tool to keep myself going, but that's, that's kind of how I, how I looked at it.
Story_ID: 340086
Speaker 1: You worked on one project straight through or you had different projects (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I had--
Speaker 1: --going on at different stages of development?
Speaker 2: Well, I had one project--I had one project that was--that was central.  So, 'Two Dollars and a Dream,' 'Madam Walker' ['Madam C.J. Walker: Two Dollars and a Dream'] was central.  'Methadone' ['Methadone: Curse or Cure'] was central.  'The Black Press' ['The Black Press: Soldiers Without Swords'] was central.  And then I would work on other stuff as it came--as it came along.  So, especially as time went on, by the time I got to 'The Black Press,' you know, I kind of, you know, had a little bit of a reputation and was able to do other things while I was taking that seven years to make so I did a coup- I did a film, a couple of films for the Smithsonian Institution [Washington, D.C.] 'cause I lived in Washington, D.C. for a while.  I did a film for the federal government.  You know, I did a bunch of things, but I--but I, but the big project was, was 'The Black Press,' which I was, you know, trying to basically raise money for.
Story_ID: 340087
Speaker 1: You also did a film ['Marcus Garvey: Look for Me in the Whirlwind'] about Marcus Garvey?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And you did a film ['A Place of Our Own'] about--we were talking about--you were saying you didn't have a lot of childhood memories, but you made a movie about a childhood memory.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  We should go back because, I mean the big film for me, in some ways, was 'The Black Press' ['The Black Press: Soldiers Without Swords'] and that was--that was--that was really the film that, that in some ways, changed my life because this was the, you know, this was a film that won a lot of awards, that did really well and I remember Bill Greaves [HistoryMaker William Greaves] talked to me afterwards, and he said, you know, "The big difference between this and 'Two Dollars and a Dream' ['Madam C.J. Walker: Two Dollars and A Dream'] is, you know, everybody can make one film, but now you've made two.  And that changes the whole equation for you--because now, you know, there's a lot of people that make one film and it's a good film, but it's not a lot of people who make two films, two good films."  And, and, you know, and I, instantly--I, I just understood what he was saying and it kind of made me feel different, differently about myself.  But that also was, was something that propelled me.
Story_ID: 340088
Speaker 1: But also, at the same time, I should say, one of the other things that happened for me was that I, I lived in Washington, D.C. for a couple of years and I got this call out of the blue and it was people from Bill Moyers' [Bill D. Moyers] office in New York [New York] and, and, and, they called me, literally my phone rang out of the blue and they said, "You know, somehow there's this film of yours floating around WNET [WNET-TV, New York, New York], the public station in, in New York, and it landed on our desk, 'Two Dollars and a Dream' ['Madam C.J. Walker: Two Dollars and a Dream'].  We really like it.  We'd really like to talk to you about this series ['Listening to America'] that we're doing--about coming in working as a producer on this series."  I came, I went there and, you know, I was just floored by that 'cause, you know, Bill Moyers is like the king of public television, and you know, I thought they, they would just call and, you know--and I went there and basically when I walked in it was kind of like a done deal that they wanted to hire me to work on this show and, and, you know, it was just one of those for gambling, those--again one of those lucky things.  I, you know, I had given 'Two Dollars and a Dream' to somebody else at, at WNET for something else, looking for some other work to somebody else and somehow it had floated around and it had gotten to them and they hired me to work on, on a series for them.  I worked for them for about a year and then maybe a couple of years later I worked for them on another series ['What Can We Do About Violence?'] as a producer.  So, that also changed, you know, kind of who I was and how I was seen in the industry because now I'd been a producer for, for Bill Moyers and so that kind of changed everything.
Story_ID: 340089
Speaker 1: And I, you know, I could tell you a minute about my experience with Bill Moyers [Bill D. Moyers] which (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: --which was really interesting experience because, you know, I went in to Bill Moyers' and, you know, I had--I had never really worked for somebody that, you know, like in this organization [WNET-TV, New York, New York], on this team, and one of the things that, that people alwa- you know, always say to you is, you know--you know, then, I don't know, somebody said to me at this point, I just remembered it, you know, you know, a black person has to work twice as hard as everybody else and twice as long and twice as hard as everybody else.  And, you know, I thought about that, and instead of like taking it as some kind of negative, I--the way I took it was okay, thank you for telling me.  You know.  I appreciate you letting me know and so what I did was I worked twice as hard and twice as long as everybody else.  I went in there--I made it my duty to be the last one to leave.  And so I would be the last one to leave every night.  And they--I didn't care if I was just reading the newspaper or calling up on the phone to my friends, okay.  I was the last one out of there every night and that's just how I--how I operated my business. I remember the first--I remember we--the first show--that every producer was assigned to a show.  This was--we, I worked on a, a show called 'Listening to America' ['Listening to America'].  That was the first thing I worked on with Bill Moyers was, it was like leading up to the 19--oh geez--'92 [1992] election--1992 election, and that was the first time Bill Clinton [President William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton] was elected, 1992, yeah, 1992 election and, and, what, what we did was he divided up and each producer would take a show and, and my show was on the war on drugs, which I was really interested in, so I-'cause I'd just done this film on methadone ['Methadone: Curse or Cure']--so, we did as the war on drugs--and I remember the first week, week right before our show aired where I worked, you know, was in ninety-six hours or something like that, in a week and we were trying figure out, you know, like how many hours that was a day, but we, we, I worked ninety-six hours in that week.  But, you know, I was like fine with it, you know, if that's--if a black man has to work twice as long and twice as hard, then that's just what I'll do, I'll just work twice as long, twice as hard.  And that's how I went into it.
Story_ID: 340090
Speaker 1: Did you meet him?  I mean, of course, you met him (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah, we worked with Bill [Bill D. Moyers], yeah.
Speaker 1: --but he wasn't easy to work with?  Was he good? Was he a good employer?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Bill was great.  Bill's incredible, incredible, incredible person to work with.  Incredible boss.  Incredible--it was--it was just great.  I mean, it was like a dream job, you know, I, I, I'd see him and talk to him like once a year now or something, you know.  I still go to him for favors if I need letter or something like that, you know.  Hopefully one day he'll come to me for something 'cause I owe him a lot.  But, you know, he, he--it was great to work with him for a lot of reasons.  You know, Bill, Bill was about business.  He wasn't about, you know, ego, you know, he, you know--you know, I remember we showed him the first cut we did, it was a thing on the war on drugs, and we showed him the film to him and my memory of it was, you know, we showed him the film and he kind of had this senior producer who was kind of a pain in the butt and the senior producer had all these, you know, "Well, I don't know about this and I don't--," and Bill stopped him and Bill said, "Well, you know, you have one shot where the narrator is talking about the CIA [Central Intelligence Agency] and you show inside this office building."  He said, "That's not the CIA, is it?  Because I don't think they let cameras into the CIA."  And I said, "No it's not."  He said, "Well, you can't do that.  Besides that, the show is fine."  And, you know, that was how he was, you know, and, and, and so it was great working with him.  I learned a lot.  I learned a lot about managing people and working with other people, getting people all on the same page and to work together and to give them a certain amount of independence, and also to let them and make th- make them understand that, that what they're doing is something special and it's a gift.  You know, whenever you're working on a production, if you have funding (laughter) to make a film, you know, it's a gift because, you know, there's a hundred people out there who are trying to get funding, you know, and you've got it.  I learned a lot about that and it was just great.  It was also great because people--people love and respect Moyers so when you call people, I mean, I, I, you know, I mean we got congressmen who, you know, would call us back, you know.  I remember we shot, shot an interview--a series of interviews with congressmen and they all came out of, of [U.S.] Congress on their lunch hour, you know, and we met them outside Congress and they just would line up to be interviewed.  You know, partially because it was Moyers, partially because they respect what he--what he does, you know, and that's across the board.  There're people who don't agree with him, they know that he's going to give them a fair shake.  It's going to be a fair show.  It's going to be real journalism, it's not going to be a bunch a crap and it's not going to be a bunch of shouting and yelling and, and, and, and unfounded statements.  So, you know, I, I learned a ton and it was great.  And, and again, it, it, it lifted who I was, who I was thought--who, who, lifted what people thought about me to another level, but also lifted what I thought about myself, you know, and, and, so we (unclear) now, you know, I wished that in some ways that, that I didn't need that.  It would be great (laughter) if I hadn't needed that, but I did, you know, and it did make me think, well, you know, wait a minute.  You know, hey, I'm working with the top guy, you know, and they called me on the phone, you know.  Maybe I should, you know, set my sights higher and, and any kind of standards that I have to live up to with Bill, I better live up to those myself, not only while I'm here, but when I walk out this door on, on my projects.  You know, they got to be, you know, this good or better, you know.  From now on.  So, it really, it really helps.
Story_ID: 340091
Speaker 1: All right, so I'm at 'The Black Press' ['The Black Press: Soldiers Without Swords'], so, anyway, it was that and, and also working in, in 'The Black Press' which really--'cause 'The Black Press' took another seven years, and that was kind of my second, so by the time 'The Black Press' was finished, I had done two stints with Moyers [Bill D. Moyers] on two different shows ['Listening to America' and 'What Can We Do About Violence?'].  I had produced a bunch of smaller films.  'Freedom Bags,' and a bunch of other films, couple (unclear)  for the Smithsonian museum [Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C.] and some other things, and, but I--and, but I had produced 'Two Dollars and a Dream' ['Madam C.J. Walker: Two Dollars and a Dream'], and I had produced 'The Black Press.'  'The Black Press' went to Sundance [1999 Sundance Film Festival] and won an award [Freedom of Expression of Award] in Sundance and it won a duPont Award, Columbia duPont Award [Alfred I. duPont-Columbia University Award], and so now--and I learned some lessons about raising money and I had learned some other things, and so now things had, were starting to really change.
Story_ID: 340092
Speaker 1: I think that the other change at that, at this point, one of the huge changes, is that, you know, I, I got married in this, in this, in, in, before this, but my wife, Marcia Smith, and I formed this company, Firelight Media [New York, New York], and started, and we started working together so now I wasn't working by myself any more, you know, alone, but I had, had a partner and, and someone who, who, who was really good and who had a lot of skills that I didn't have and so I think that we then--it was a team.  You know, she's a really great writer and something that, that I'm not a great writer, and, and even more, I don't think I'm bad writer, but I hate to write.  It's really painful for me to write.  You know, it really takes a lot out of me, where, it may take a lot out of her, but she does it.  (Laughter) You know, so, so, I think that that was also it's just this, and I can't, you know, I mean that was--that was a huge, huge change in, in, in my life and how, for instance, I wasn't this kind of lone filmmaker out there.  I was--we now had a company, Firelight Media, we had a partner, we hired a couple of people to work with us in the office, and we were able to start securing--we got some what they call core foundation money from the Ford Foundation [New York, New York] to kind of help us.  It wasn't for any kind of film, it was for Firelight Media.  For Firelight Media to get going and to work and then to start an office and to work on projects.  And so all these things started--fell into place all at once.  You know, that, that--you know, I had some films under my belt.  I had this kind of better reputation.  You know, Marcia came on board.  We got some seed money from, from the Ford Foundation to start an organization.  And, there was a little bit--there's a--it was just this kind of really beginning of a more of an interest in documentary films.  And, so, we were kind of off and running.
Story_ID: 340093
Speaker 1: Could you tell some--the films that your company has done?
Speaker 2: We did--so the first one that we really worked on was really a kind of independent film.  Marcia [Marcia Smith] worked on 'The Black Press' ['The Black Press: Soldiers Without Swords'] outsourced as a writer--as one of the writers, and then we did 'Marcus Garvey: Look for Me in the Whirlwind' was done kind of in a transition period.  So that was still done by me and my company, which was Half Nelson Productions, moving into being Firelight [Firelight Media, New York, New York].  Marcia wrote the script but she was still working for Ford Foundation [New York, New York], so Marcia--so Marcia came out of (unclear). I might not have said that, but Marcia came out of this foundation world so she knew the foundation world really well and she knew--she knew--not only did she know people, (laughter) but she also knew the process and how to write proposals, and, and, you know, but she also had training as a--as a filmmaker.  She was also very good at, you know, just, you know, the practicalities of looking at a script, looking at a film and making comments and structural things.  So she was incredible on that.
Story_ID: 340094
Speaker 1: And then we [Firelight Media, New York, New York] did "The Murder of Emmett Till" for 'American Experience,' and, and at that point, we did "Marcus Garvey" ["Marcus Garvey: Look for Me in the Whirlwind"] for 'American Experience,' that was our first film for the show on PBS [Public Broadcasting Service] called 'American Experience,' which did well, and then we did "The Murder of Emmett Till" for 'American Experience,' that was our second which just, you know, did incredibly well on a number (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Was that hard to do?
Speaker 1: "The Murder of Emmett Till" was--no.  It was a very--"The Murder of Emmett Till" was a--was a--you know, I don't want to make light of it.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: But it was--it was a very easy film to do in, in relationship to a lot of other films that we've done.  Because at that point, up to the murder--"The Murder of Emmett Till" was the first film I made--first film for public television, the first film for the public that I have ever made that had one funder.  So, 'American Experience' funded the whole thing.  They funded the whole thing and to their great credit, they funded the whole thing very quickly on the basis of an idea, and then they said could you expand that idea and then could you write a script.  And so, you know, they, they funded it and, and so we didn't have to go through the seven-year process that we went through to make "Two Dollars and a Dream" ["Madam C.J. Walker: Two Dollars and a Dream"].  The seven-year process that we had to make--that we went through to make "The Black Press" ["The Black Press: Soldiers Without Swords"].  You know, so they funded "Emmett Till," you know, from the time we gave them the idea to the time they fully funded it, might have been three months, or so.  And then from the time they funded it--okay, here's the money, go make the film--it took us about nine months.
Story_ID: 340095
Speaker 1: And it was a very clear straight story, 'Emmett Till' ['The Murder of Emmett Till'] was, I mean it was a very straight story.  It's, you know, once upon a time, you know, this happens, this happens, this happens, as opposed to a film like 'The Black Press' ['The Black Press: Soldiers Without Swords'], which we really had to make up as we went along.  You know, there was no film, there was no story, we had make this story up.  So, you know, it, it was a hard film in some ways emotionally, but in terms of, you know, nuts and bolts day to day, no.  It was--it, it, you know, I mean, you know, I could lie, and say oh, this was the hardest film I've ever made because it's a film that I'm really proud of.  I mean, I think it's a really incredibly crafted film and when I say that I, I, I say that--I mean, you know, I say that, I could say these kinds of things about filming cause it's not me, I'm just part of it, you know, when editors, assistant editors, writer, you know, camera person, you know, researcher, you know, all these people who have to all do--all do their jobs and they're all, in a lot of ways, they're pretty autonomous.  You know what I mean, they're doing their thing and I'm doing mine and it's all coming together, but it's a--it's a well-crafted film, but it was, you know, in ter- I mean--and it was those films where it was a lot of incredibly lucky things happened.  You know, we found stuff, we found people, you know, a lot of things fell into place, so, you know, I'd love to say this was, you know, the hardest thing I ever did but it wasn't, you know--I mean, you know, it wasn't and, and I think, you know, in, in some ways for whatever reason, we didn't go through some of the anxieties you go through with the other films where, where, where, you know, you go through periods of self-doubt, where you just say is this a film?  Is this gonna work?  You know, is this going to happen?  On that film, I don't remember that ever happening, you know, I mean, you know, we got the, the stuff back that we shot, and you say, "Oh god, this is--this is really powerful," you know.  And, and we knew early on that, that it was going to work, you know, I mean--you know, that's easy for me to say now, but, but I think in terms of, you know, the degree of difficulty, you know, it's--it wasn't as hard.  I mean, the thing about filmmaking is that, that you have to understand is, you know, bad films are just as hard, or harder than good films.  You know what I mean, when people--a lot of times when people make bad films, and I've made some that aren't that great, is that, you know, you know, you know sometimes that the film isn't that great and you're trying everything you can to lift the film up to make it, you know, get it up to where you want it to be, but you can't, so you're working harder, and harder, and harder, harder, harder, harder, and harder, to make this thing work, but it just--it just isn't happening.  So, it doesn't- you know the degree of difficulty, I don't think has that much to do with how good the film finally turns out (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Story_ID: 340096
Speaker 1: It was well received.  It won some awards, didn't it?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, 'Emmett Till' ['The Murder of Emmett Till'] was really well received.  It, it won a special jury prize [Special Jury Award] at Sundance [2003 Sundance Film Festival].  It won a Peabody Award [George Foster Peabody Award], it won an International Documentary Association Award, Marcia [Marcia Smith] won best documentary writing from the Writers Guild [Writers Guild of America] and it won one, one of my favorites, it won a prime time Emmy Award for best non-fiction film, which I love because--I love it for a lot of reasons, but we were up against this film by James Cameron who did the 'Titanic.'  He did a film called 'Raising the Bismarck' [sic. 'Expedition: Bismarck'] or something like that, we were up against that and we were also up against the last episode of 'American Idol.'  Non-fiction, (laughter) the category was non-fiction, non-fiction program--non-fiction directing. So, we were up against the last--and so, you know, we thought we, we, we didn't, you know, think that we had a chance, you know, because we didn't have the guns, we didn't have, you know, we didn't have any clout in Hollywood, we didn't have anything, so we just kind of went to--you know, we were really happy to go to the, the Emmy Awards and actually--the day of the Emmy Awards, Marcia made me rent a tuxedo, because I wasn't even (laughter)--I was, you know, I was going to go in my pajamas, but she made me rent a tuxedo, so thank God.
Story_ID: 340097
Speaker 1: So, when we left you, you were running up on stage to collect your Emmy [Emmy Award] (laughter)
Speaker 2: I was--oh, yeah.  So, anyway that was a great surprise, and wonderful.  So, yeah so 'Emmett Till' ['The Murder of Emmett Till'], you know, received a lot of awards and then a couple of years later it was credited as one of the reasons why they reopened the Emmett Till case, so that was just incredible (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right, right.  So, you very proud of that film?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I mean, I'm, I'm very proud of this film--I'm very, you know, in some ways I'm, I'm much more proud of the film because of what it is, you know, I mean, I, I really like the film.  I can show the film at any time.  I can, you know, I just, over the last weekend taught a little seminar class and we used parts of the film.  I'm very proud of the film not so much for the awards it--it's won or, or what it's done but just--as a film I think it holds up as a film and I'm proud of that.
Story_ID: 340098
Speaker 1: That must have just expanded your horizons even more, you've got this Emmy [Emmy Award] now, you've got Moyers [Bill D. Moyers] now, he's got an Emmy.  So, what other things did, did this lead to--what have you done?
Speaker 2: I'm, you know, it's really funny, because my father [Stanley Nelson, Sr.] is very practical, you know, person says, you know, so, you know, so you got an Emmy so, you know what is that--what is that lead to, you know.  How does that help and, you know, I've thought about it a lot partially because he, he asked that question and, and, you know, the, the funny thing about this is, you never know.  I mean people don't tell you, you know, that they've accepted your proposal or they're going to fund you, or they call you on the phone.  They don't say that they do that because you won an Emmy.  But you know that it doesn't hurt, you know.  Nobody says, well he won an Emmy so we're not going to call him.  So, it doesn't hurt, but it, it leads to very little, kind of concrete things, you know.  You don't know, you know, again nobody says, you know, we called you because of the Emmy, or we are going to work with you because of the Emmy or we want you because of this.
Story_ID: 340099
Speaker 1: You know, but at this same time actually as we were finishing filming 'Emmett Till' ['The Murder of Emmett Till'], I got the, the MacArthur Award [MacArthur Fellowship], which was very concrete 'cause, you know, that's a very concrete thing.  It's $500,000 that they--MacArthur [John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, Chicago, Illinois] gives you.  And it's not tied to any project.  Its $500,000 really for you to do what you want to do.  I have three kids, so it's to help my three kids go to college and go to private school and go to the dentist basically (laughter). Basically is what my money is for, but you know, that was--that was very concrete.  And I think that, that also, I think in some ways even more than an Emmy [Emmy Award], you know, has this kind of cultural cache that, that, that's just there, you know.  You know, MacArthur--they call it the Genius Award.  MacArthur publicizes it.  They make a big deal abou- about announcing it, you know.  I heard this morning I was listening to public radio and it was NP [National Public Radio (NPR)], it was (unclear) like 'All Things Considered' brought to you by the MacArthur Foundation, who will announce, you know, their Genius Awards in September, you know, and it's now April, you know, so this is how they bill themselves.  So, you know, it's a big deal because they, they, they do a big--they do a lot--I mean, you know, they do a lot of publicity for it.  I mean they--the announcing is a big thing.  It's in the paper the next thing--day that's why I can say I, I, I'll give you $500,000 because everybody knows it 'cause they put it in the paper, you know. Also, you know, my school, the--my kids' private school that they were going to knew it and they rescinded their scholarship (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Gasp) Oh, my Lord (laughter).
Speaker 1: I don't blame 'em, but you know, what the heck.  I couldn't claim that I was a struggling--
Speaker 2: Artist anymore.
Speaker 1: --struggling filmmaker with no money any more.  I will be in a couple years, I'll be back.
Story_ID: 340100
Speaker 1: After that, what, what other movies--you've done some other films, I know? What do you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) What else did we do?  We did a, a, Firelight Media [New York, New York] did a film called 'Beyond Brown' ['Beyond Brown: Pursuing the Promise'].  A film about Brown versus Board of Ed [Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954] that commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of Brown versus Board of Ed.  We did a film called 'A Place of Our Own' about my family and about my father [Stanley Nelson, Sr.] and about the African American community on Martha's Vineyard [Massachusetts], which was a very different film for me.  It was a very personal film and it was really, very kind of different from historical films that I've done or the current affairs films that, that I do and--
Speaker 1: Did it focus on your family or just the general--that whole (unclear)--?
Speaker 2: It focused on both.  It's kind of a--is, is this kind of hybrid of, of a historical film and a personal film.  So it centers not only on the historical black community in Martha's Vineyard, but also on my family as part of that community.  It's very personal about my father and my family and, and struggling to be--to understand what it means to be both African American and middle class at the same time.
Story_ID: 340101
Speaker 1: As a film, that ['A Place of Our Own'], that, that was a hard film (laughter). Now you talk about hard films, that was, that was probably the hardest film I ever made for a number, number of reasons.  But that was a very hard film to make.
Speaker 2: Could you tell us one reason, why it was it--?
Speaker 1: Why it was hard (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 1: I, I think it was hard because, you know, we made up the stories as we were going along.  The film started out as being one thing and ended up being another.  It was also a very, very personal film.  I had to really go, you know, within myself and reveal things that, that are hard to reveal, you know, just, in our society, the way our society is set up now, you know--you know, it--I mean it's a struggle to sit in front of a camera and say I'm black and I'm middle class. You know, that's something that, that, that's looked upon as a no-no.  Everybody's gotta keep it real, you know, everybody's gotta be from the projects.  And so, you know, I had to, I had to realize, you know, that that's not where I'm from.  That's not who I am and not--and I'm, and I'm very proud of who I am and that doesn't make me, you know, any less black or any more black than anybody else, but that's who I am.  And, and that's part of the black experience, and that's my black experience and it's important that we talk about that, important that we tell about that, important that we live through that, you know, because, you know, all these people who, who are out here now, you know, the, the rappers who are keeping it real, who are, who are so black and I came from, you know, the ghetto and I shot somebody when I was two and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, and I got shot eight times.  Well their kids aren't going to be living in the projects.  Their kids are gonna be raised up black and, and middle class or black and rich, you know.  What does that mean?  Does that mean their kids are less black?  No, you know, and, and it's something that, that we strive for.  I hope that that part of what we strive for is, is, is to raise, not only our conscientiousness, but also our economic status.  I mean nobody, nobody wants to be poor, you know, it should be nobody's, nobody's life goal to live in the projects, you know.  The projects are something that, that, that, that, that, that you struggle to, to move away from, I hope.  I mean that's, you know, that's what they're there for, you know.  Nobody wants to live in, in, in public assistance housing, you know, so you struggle to move away far from it, you struggle to make it--you struggle to make it livable while you're there and to make it, and, and to make it a, a, a decent and, and a, a loving place while you're there but you also, you know, as, as, as a community we struggle to get away from that.  And so it was--it was--it was hard, you know, to, to say, you know, hey, I'm--this is who I am.  You know, but also to talk about, you know, it's a very personal film.  We talk about growing up.  I talk about, you know, my experiences in private school [New Lincoln School, New York, New York], what it was like, you know, to be one of a few black kids.  What it was like to be one of a few black kids, you know, after we moved--we moved when I was thirteen to basically a white neighborhood.  So we went from this kind of black neighborhood, this building that, that had a whole bunch of, of kind of mixed kids but mostly black into a building that was all white that didn't have any kind of group of kids that hung together.  And that's where we moved when I was thirteen or fourteen and so, you know, we moved from one thing to the other.  So, so what that was like.  What those experiences were like.  And so it was a rough film, and, and, and, and I was in--I had to go kind of deeper and deeper within myself, within my own feelings and, and I had to really be pushed and pulled there by a number of people that worked on the film.
Story_ID: 340102
Speaker 1: How did your father [Stanley Nelson, Sr.] react to it?
Speaker 2: My father loved the film ['A Place of Our Own'], although this film was very critical of my father 'cause my father, you know, left the family, you know, a couple of times, you know, as I was growing up and was very critical of his--him and his role and some of the things that he struggled with.  It also--I think my fath- my father really loves the film 'cause the film is also about--it's not--I think it, it's not a hurtful film, it's not a hateful film.  It talks about that and talks about my struggling to come to grips with that and to coming to understand my father and, and, and coming to, to love this man, you know, in spite of, you know, things that, that have happened in the past.  And, and, and to, and it's about accepting the past and moving on and, and accepting your family and moving on.
Story_ID: 340103
Speaker 1: Can you tell us something about your recent films? "Sweet Honey in the Rock" and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.  Most, couple of recent films that we [Firelight Media, New York, New York] did.  We had a film, "Sweet Honey in the Rock: Raise Your Voice," which was a ninety-minute film, which is part-performance, part-behind the scenes with an a cappella singer with "Sweet Honey in the Rock," which is a, a film that I love greatly and was just incredibly fun to do and, and, and like all my films so far, it's been a very incredible learning experience, it's been very different from the other films.  This is a music film.  We shot the film, you know, on stages, a couple stages around the country, you know, sometimes with five cameras and high-definition and cameras on booms and jig-arms and zooming in and all that kind of stuff, you know, with audiences and stuff like that.  And it was just incredible film to, to make and a different kind of experience of working with this singing group of five, five African American women.  That group that I greatly have admired for a long time so that--we did that.  We also did a, a film ["High Stakes: The Battle to Save Our Schools"] last year, which I was executive producer, on for CNN on high-stakes testing for a show called 'CNN Presents,' which is CNN's documentary hours on Sunday nights we did on high-stakes testing which was also an incredible film.  I've also in the, in the, in the last couple of years have been executive producing a number of films.  I just executive produced a film called "Beyond Beats and Rhymes" ["Hip-Hop: Beyond Beats and Rhymes"], which is a fil- a critical view--look at hip-hop by a young, a young black man who's, who's kind of part of that hip-hop generation and, and, and, and, and takes a loving but critical look at, at, at some of the images in hip-hop.  A number of other films I've kind of executive producer on.  A film ["Faubourg Treme: The Untold Story of Black New Orleans"] that's being produced now about New Orleans [Louisiana], which was started two years before the hurricane and then incorporates the hurricane into the film.  So I'm part of that--
Story_ID: 340104
Speaker 1: I just finished a film called "Jonestown: The Life and Death of Peoples Temple," which is a film that I'm producer/director on, which is for 'American Experience,' which we just love, which actually will premier in about a month, a month at the Tribeca Film Festival [New York, New York] and also San Francisco Film Festival [San Francisco International Film Festival, San Francisco, California].  So, we are very, we very, very much love this film.  We just can't wait to see what the reaction will be to the film.  It's a very emotional film. That was probably the hard, hardest emotional film I have ever made.  It's a very emotional story.  We worked with a number of people who were part of Peoples Temple [Peoples Temple of the Disciples of Christ].  Many--a couple who saw their families die who were in Jonestown [Guyana] when it happened and saw their families die.  But everyone in the film lost loved ones.  Every single person in the film lost people that they were very, very close to.  Some lost their mothers, and sons, and daughters, and sisters and brothers and so that was a very (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) How did you come to work on that film?
Speaker 1: You know, we came to work on it I think the, in some ways the same way we came to work on "Emmett Till" ["The Murder of Emmett Till"], which was, you know, Marcia [Marcia Smith], my wife and partner, you know, heard something on the radio, read an article and said, you know, this is an incredible story, you know.  And we started looking into it, we started looking into it and reading about it and trying to--I know the first thing that we do is see what other films have been made or are being made and, and found that there was nothing really that had been made on Peoples Temple that was really substantiative, and so we just started rolling and then we, we started getting into it and again, we had done a couple films for, for 'American Experience' by this time and "Emmett Till" was the last and "Emmett Till" had done very well and we were looking around for another project to take to them.  And we took this to them and, and to their great credit again they said yes, and so this was another film.  Took us about a year to, to produce but I really, really like this film a lot and, and hope that we get--hope that the audience reaction is the same.  We'll know 'cause in a--in a month we'll start a series of screenings so we just can't wait for that.
Story_ID: 340105
Speaker 1: Can you tell us about any projects you would like to do in the future?
Speaker 2: I don't know what--what's going to happen and, you know, what, what, what we're gonna work on in the future.  We, we actually had kind of taken a hiatus after 'Jonestown' ['Jonestown: The Life and Death of Peoples Temple'].  We, we moved from New York [New York] to the Bay Area [San Francisco Bay Area] in California in, in September (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Why?  May I ask why?
Speaker 2: Well, we were looking around for, for, for what to do, you know.  We now have three kids and our--we own a brownstone in New York and, and we would've had to re-renovate the whole brownstone to accompany the whole family comfortably.  We were trying to figure out--we didn't want to do that and we're trying to figure out whether we should move to another part of the city or the suburbs.  My brother [Ralph Nelson] lives in Berkeley [California].  My wife's brother lives in, in Oakland [California].  We--we'd always liked this area and we said, you know, let's just give it a shot, let's just give it a shot, you know.  And I think the thing that convinced me is, is Marcia [Marcia Smith] said to me, "Well, you know, we can always move back.  If you don't like it we, we can always move back to New York," and that's what we said, you know.  Let's, let's, let's give it a shot, you know, and so we've been here seven months or so, and it's been good.
Speaker 1: Except for the rain (laughter).
Speaker 2: Except for the rain.  It looks like it rains every day, which nobody mentioned (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right.  Right.  But this is unusual for us.
Speaker 2: It's unusual for you, but it's--
Speaker 1: First time from 1906.
Speaker 2: --it's the only reality that I know so--
Speaker 1: Oh, is it?  Okay.
Speaker 2: --of about living here is that it rains every day.
Story_ID: 340106
Speaker 1: You have shared, you know, you've made these wonderful films, have you--you've learned so much in the process of making all of these films, have you shared what you've learned with like students?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Have you taught, you haven't taught?
Speaker 2: It's a secret--shh, shh.  No, I, I, try (laughter)--I try to share as much as I--I try to teach and, and do what I can.  I mean, I, I taught last year at Brooklyn College [Brooklyn, New York] for a year.  I was kind of a gue-, guest professor at Brooklyn College for a year, which was great.  I taught at Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] in like 1989, '90 [1990] for a year.  Those are my formal, I do a lot, I did a seminar last Friday.  I do a seminar in May--no, in, in a week in--at Berkley [University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, California].  I do a lo-, a fair amount of that when I have time.  I found that, you know, teaching is ent-, is, is incredibly time-consuming, and, and, and, and, you know, it's hard--it's not easy to be a good teacher, you know, and it really takes a lot of work and, you know, so I, I haven't--you know--I, I, I don't know if I could do what I do and kind of hold a full-time faculty position.  Some filmmakers do and I am always amazed that they do it.  But I think that, that teaching full-time is something that I'll--that I'm--that I'm try-, I, I'd like to set myself up for that later on down the line because I really do enjoy it.  But I think, you know, it--it's really hard to do, you know, and, and, and also be a full-time filmmaker.  You have to be incredibly organized which I'm not, so I think it's, it's something, that, that I'd like to do more of, but at this point, I'd like to have the time to really do it right.

Speaker 1: You must be very, very busy, so how do you relax?  I know you are a coach for your Little League team?  Yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Little League team.  Well, I mean--you know, I, I don't--relaxing is like not--I don't find it hard to relax, I mean, I got--I got three kids.  I have a sixteen-year-old [Max Nelson], and seven-year-old twins [Nola Nelson and Kai Nelson], a boy and a girl, so I, a lot of time is, is just spent, you know--I mean, you know, taken up with, with my family and just trying to, you know, get the kids--pick up the kids from school, get them to school in the morning, you know.  I've, I've taken this kind of hiatus time that we've, we've had and, you know, I've been going to the gym a lot and trying--and trying to go to gym a lot.  I'm, I, I, I started fishing about seven or eight years ago and I love to fish so actually--
Speaker 1: What kind of fishing?
Speaker 2: I, I mainly--you know, we spend a lot of time in, in Martha's Vineyard [Massachusetts], Cape Cod [Massachusetts], so I'd do mostly my fishing there.  I haven't really gotten into fishing since I've been back he-, here since I've been here in the Bay Area [San Francisco Bay Area, California], but that's something I want to try to do this spring is get into fishing a little bit in the spring, but mostly it's, it's--I, I fish in, in oceans, I don't do a lot of lake fishing.
Speaker 1: Oh.  Go out on the boat and--
Speaker 2: Well, yeah, but Martha's Vineyard is, is an incredible place for fishing from the shore which is one of the, the most--one of the things about it that makes it really amazing for fishing that--you know, I, going up there, I spent a lot time where I didn't fish, but it's one of the prime destinations in the world for fishing.  We can fish on the boat there and, and in the middle of the summer, you almost need to fish on the boat when the water gets warmer, but in the spring, in the fall and, and in the beginning of the summer and end of the summer, you can catch incredible fish from the shore, which is just really a kick.  It's just really a kick to kind of throw your, your line into the ocean, you know, into this big ocean and, and come out with a fish.  It's just like--(laughter) it's like finding treasure, you know, it's really amazing, amazing thing so-- I, I do that and, and, you know, but a lot of my time is, is, you know, between filmmaking.  You know, my father [Stanley Nelson, Sr.] moved out to Oakland [California], too.  He's actually ninety years old, he's living on his own in Oakland.  He has someone who, who, who take--you know, helps him out and during the day for a few hours a day, but he lives on his own.  So between spending some time with my dad here, spending time with my kids and my family, you know, and trying to see my brother [Ralph Nelson] and Marcia's [Marcia Smith] brother and do, run this business and go to--you know, it's--you know, and then I've been trying to go to the gym.  I got a lot of stuff--it's not like I'm looking for stuff to do usually.
Story_ID: 340108
Speaker 1: How do you feel about the way you've lived your life and what's important to you?
Speaker 2: I, I feel good, I mean, I, I think I've been incredibly lucky, you know.  I, I look pa-, back and I talk to some--someone like you about this stuff, and it always amazes me--I mean, you know, I--it's just, it's just been--it's been incredible, lucky and, and, you know, when I talk about how things kind of happened, you know, this happened, this happened, this happened, this happen--you know, like Bill Greaves [HistoryMaker William Greaves] and I'm like a block from--my mother's [A'Lelia Ransom Nelson] reading a paper, it's just incredible luck and, and you know, in, in, in, in doing things, things have just really worked out.  I think the other thing is though that when I've been lucky for whatever reason, I've been able to capitalize on that.  I've always put, you know, the filmmaking first, and that's always been--I've always been really clear about that is, is, is what I want to try to do when I make a film is to--is to have that lead to another film and not have that stop me dead, dead in my tracks, so I'm trying to put, you know, all the money--all, all that I know up there on the screen.  I think that's really important, you know, that I, I--you know, if I get a grant for $500,000, I'm trying to put $500,000 up there on the screen, I'm not trying to put $350,000 in my pocket, which you could, might be able to do, you know, you'll never do another one. But you know, you could--you'll figure out how to make the film for $200,000 or so, and put $300,000 in your pocket, which filmmakers have done.  You know, but I'm---that's not what I'm trying to do.  I'm trying to make the best film I possibly can so that I can then use that to make another film and then use that to make another one, and another one, and another one, paying myself a salary, a decent salary as I do, but not trying to get rich, you know, off, off, off the budget of a film trying to make the film look like, you know, if somebody gives--if I could raise $500,000 for a film we're trying to make that film look like, you know, I had $600,000.
Story_ID: 340109
Speaker 1: Is there anything you'd still like to do?
Speaker 2: There's a lot of things, I mean, I, I--you know, I, I, I, I--we've toyed with the idea of trying to do some kind of fictional film, something that I--that, that--that's why I went into filmmaking.  I don't know if I have the energy to do it.  I don't know if I can stop what I'm doing now and break a break to do something else, but it's something that, that we talk about.  You know, I, I, I don't know.  I, I--we have a, a series that, that we've been trying to get off the ground for a couple of years to do a film on--it's a series on, on the economics of the slave trade.  It's not really--and, and, and, and how the slave trade worked economically and look at the slave trade as a business and, and enoc- you know, how that, how that worked.  That's not something that I, that I, you know, we've gotten--we've raised some money--research money to do that, so I have a commitment to doing that.  I just need some time to kind of develop and get that rolling.  So, I'd like to do that, and then, you know, we're, we're already trying to take a, a break from, from the beginning of "Jonestown" ["Jonestown: The Life and Death of Peoples Temple"]--we're, we're, we're supposed to work, work with 'American Experience' on that and they're doing a five-part series ["We Shall Remain"] on Native American history in the United States, so we're gonna to do one show in that series and that doesn't start until the fall, so we're taking a break until then, you know, some things may come up, we may do some other stuff.  We're trying to take a break to do that, until we do that and, and so I'm looking at, at other things that we can do in the meantime.  I mean--I'm sorry--things that we can do afterwards and, and where we will really want to go and what we really want to do, you know, rather than kind of just be on this treadmill and take one job after the other.  We want to take a break 'cause it's been the last ten years or so I've just been kind of incredible, you know, like one thing after the other has been just incredible amount of stuff.  I, I was thinking about it the other day and, and in the last four years, we--I've produced and directed four films and executive produced four films, and maybe even more, I can't even remember what I think I've done.  So there's a lot--we've done a lot of stuff in, in the last while, and, and I'm, I'm trying to now just kind of sit back and, and say where do we want to go, you know, and, and, and, and, and, and what we want to do, and, and, and how can we use whatever clout that we have and the one thing that we're really committed to is training other African American filmmakers and, and working with other people and, and, and that's something that we're really committed to, so it's been one of the reasons why it's hard for us to get off, off this treadmill because when we do a project, you know, there's four or five people that come with us when we executive produce a project like when we executive produced "Beyond Brown" ["Beyond Brown: Pursuing the Promise"], you know, which was really our project, I was executive producer.  We had four different teams, you know, with producers, editors, associate producers, all working and being paid that we hired and all to some degree helping their resumes, putting money in their pocket, you know, and it's really important for, for that to happen, so, you know, being kind of where we are in this African American film community, it's really important for us to kind of keep working, so we kind of--are able to keep other people working, but in, in--so sometimes that's hard and so it's, it's, it's, it's this burden, you know, want to just say let me just--let me just relax for a minute.  So, we're taking a little time to do that now, you know, while, while the MacArthur Fellowship is still active and kick-, kicking it and there's still money coming in from that and we're able to kind of sit back for a minute.

Speaker 1: Do you have any regrets about your life?  Something you, you wish you had done, or--?
Speaker 2: Not really.  No, I don't kind of--I try not to think, think that way at all.  It's not--I just don't really think about, you know, I wish I could have done this that way, or wish I could have done--not, no.  Unh-uh.
Speaker 1: Your, your films are, are historical, so, so you, you always, you know, when you do these films you're going--well, except for the 'Sweet Honey in the Rock' ['Sweet Honey in the Rock: Raise Your Voice'] and you, you go back into history, you look at history--how do you see--as, as a human being, as a person--how do you see the future for, for blacks?  I, I don't know if this is a--you've seen this, this evolution (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.  Yeah, I mean, I don't know.  I, I have no idea, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  I know we don't--it's kind of hard to see the future, but how do you feel?  Do you feel confident that (unclear)--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: No?
Speaker 2: No.  No, I don't.  I don't know.  I mean, one of the things that, that if you--if you do any kind of research in the, in, in history that, that you realize is that history is not, it's not--it's not an upward movement, it's not a progressive movement.  And I, I think that, that a lot of times black people, because our history or, you know, a lot of times we started slavery so we think okay, this is progressive movement, we're always moving forward, but it's not, you know.  History goes back and forward and back and forward and back and forward, and you know--you know, there are--there are times that are--that are--that are darker, and, than others and I think that, that, you know, we're in, in a, in a, in a time now that's pretty dark and I don't think we're in, in, in the, I don't think we're in, in, in the end of the dark tunnel. In other words like coming out and nothing's getting better. I think things, things have, have, have, have a--have, have a great capability to get a, a lot worse, you know.  I was reading an article today about Iraq and I was thinking like well, then you hear about people carrying guns and stuff like that, and the whole breakdown of the social structure, and I was like, you know--you know, those people couldn't have envisioned that--
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: --five years ago, you know, and, and, you know, that, that--and they're talking about how, how that whole kind of destabilizing influence is, is traveling, you know, to neighboring states and then there was an article, co-articles in the paper about, about West Africa, you know, because the guy, the guy, Taylor [Charles Taylor] (simultaneous)--.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Taylor.
Speaker 2: --Taylor was caught and, and, and all of that and then how he destabilized that whole region you know and, and what if--what if that kind of thing, you know, really does travel.  What if travels, you know, so I was traveling around, around the world, what if it travels here.  I mean, you know, I don't want to say that, you know, but it--but it, but nothing is a given, you know, you know what I mean, just like people in Iraq could have never foretold what was--what's happening there five or six years ago, you know.  So I don't--I don't, I mean, I don't--I don't see a lot kind of positive signs that say hey things are changing for the--for, for the black community for the--for the positive, you know, I just don't see it.  I mean but, but on the other hand, you know, I think you have to--one thing that my mother [A'Lelia Ransom Nelson] believed in was the basic goodness of human beings and I think that that's what you have to believe in and then I, then I do believe that basically, you know, human beings are, are good and want to do good and want to be good and that, that finally in the final analysis that's going go win out over, over everything, you know, at some point finally.
Story_ID: 340111
Speaker 1: You've mentioned you got three children.  What values do--would you like to pass on to them?  What message--what do you think is important to teach them?
Speaker 2: I don't know, you know.  And it's so funny 'cause, you know, when, when, when you don't have kids and you think abstractly about kids, you know, you want it to be one thing, you know, but when you have 'em, you know, it becomes about being something very practical, you know, finish your cereal, put your shoes on and let's go to school. You know, I mean I think what, what I try--what it boils down to me with, with my kids is just like, you know, do your best, you know, and that's what I try to tell them, you know.  You know when, you know, when I'm teaching these little kids in Little League I just tell them, you know, do your best and that's all you can do and, you know, and, you know what your best is, you know, you know within yourself what your best is.  Do your best and let the rest take care of itself, you know, and if you do your best you'll feel good about yourself and, and, and you'll feel good about the results even if, you know--even if you don't hit a home run, even if you don't, you know, do, you know--you know, even if you're not the best you'll have done your best and as long as you know that everything else is okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right.
