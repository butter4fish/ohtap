Speaker 2: Hm.  Joe DiMaggio used to have a great saying.  It was, somebody asked him once why he played hard every day, and he said, well, I play hard every day because the guy coming to see me today may not have been here yesterday.  I always thought that was a great phrase.
Speaker 1: That's awesome, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I'm, I'm probably butchering that phrase (laughter) but it was--
Speaker 1: Right, yeah, the meaning, yeah.
Speaker 2: I'm paraphrasing it to some point, but I've always admired that.
Speaker 1: And it works within your industry.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: The guy who tunes in today may be tuning in for the first time.

Story_ID: 500743
Speaker 1: We're going to start by talking about you're a- your family tree, and the influences in the family.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: We're going to start with your mother's side of the family.  If you can you give me your mother's full name, your mother's date and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Okay.  My mother's name was Julia Jeannette Hamilton [Julia Hamilton Mitchell].  She was born in St. Louis, Missouri on December 10th, 1933.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And just spell that name out for me, so that there's no confusion--
Speaker 2: Julia, J-U-L-I-A; Jeannette I believe was G-E-A- J-E-A-N-N-E-T-T-E, Hamilton, H-A-M-I-L-T-O-N.  I didn't know her as Jeannette.  When she got married to my dad [Lowell Mitchell], she dropped Jeannette from her name.  So, I don't know the correct spelling of that.
Speaker 1: So, she grew up in St. Louis also?
Speaker 2: She did.
Speaker 1: Okay.  She was born in 19--you said--?
Speaker 2: Thirty-three [1933].
Speaker 1: Thirty-three [1933].  Did she ever talk about what life was like for her as a child in St. Louis?
Speaker 2: She spoke of, as a child from the '30s [1930s] growing up in the Depression [Great Depression], she spoke of those times.  She--her parents, both her parents were educators.  Her father, my grandfather, was an educator at Howard University [Washington, D.C.], and he was a principal in St. Louis [at Edward J. Simmons School], as was my grandmother, she was a teacher as well.  In fact my grandfather, Edward D. Hamilton, Edward DePass Hamilton, her father, graduated from Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] in 1905 [sic. 1906].  And he was--I would see pictures, a couple of pictures of his classmates there, and he was the only black (laughter) who graduated in that particular class.  She would speak of how she would have go to--when she would go to a movie theater, it was going in the balcony; it was not going in the front door.  In fact, growing up in St. Louis on our periodic you know Sunday drives around the city, she would show me some of the places--she and my dad would show me some of the places they would go as children.  And I remember that always struck me as wow, you couldn't you go in the front door, while you had to, you had to go and sit in the balcony.
Speaker 1: What does sh- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) She talked about--
Speaker 1: Go ahead.
Speaker 2: She talked about a child of that age, when she was born [President] Franklin Delano Roosevelt was president.  And he was president until 1945, which, so she was twelve years old.  And she would tell me how she always thought that he was always going to be president (laughter) because, because he would have been president her entire life.  So, those kinds of things she talked to me about.
Speaker 1: What did she do for a living?
Speaker 2: She was a schoolteacher.
Speaker 1: She was a schoolteacher.  And where did she go to school (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) She was a schoolteacher for thirty years in the St. Louis, Missouri public school system.  She went to school at Howard University.
Speaker 1: So she followed, she went to where her father was teaching?
Speaker 2: She went to where her, her, her mother went to school, where her father taught at one time.  He was a principal in St. Louis when she born.  But her mother went to school at Howard University.  My mother went to school at Howard University.
Speaker 1: What's your grandmother's name (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) She was always disappointed in me because I didn't go to Howard University (laughter).
Speaker 1: Because you didn't go to Howard.
Speaker 2: My grandmother's name was Julia Hamilton, same, same name as my mom.
Speaker 1: Your mother was named after her--okay, her mother.
Speaker 2: Yeah, in fact my mother was a twin, and her, her brother was Edward Hamilton.  And I guess my grandparents, I don't know if they got lazy or what, but the kids were named Julia and Edward Hamilton after, after their parents.
Speaker 1: So on your mother's side of the family, your mother's mother, are there any--can you--how far back can you go?  Your grandmother went to Howard?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: What about her mother?
Speaker 2: That's about as far back as I go.  I do know her mother passed away when she was very young.  Her father was a minister in St. Louis.  And beyond that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And so, the family stayed in St. Louis.  I mean they came--as far back as you know it's all in St. Louis?
Speaker 2: My mother- yeah, my mother's side of the family, as far back as I know stayed back in St. Louis.  My grandfather, my, my maternal grandfather, was from South Carolina.  I do know that.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what's his full name?
Speaker 2: Edward DePass Hamilton.
Speaker 1: Was he French?
Speaker 2: And DePass I believe was D--.  No, he wasn't, no.  DePass I believe was capital D, small A [sic.], P-A-S-S.  He was from South Carolina.  I knew nothing about his family--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --before him.  He was a lot older.
Speaker 1: Were they mixed, or were they--?
Speaker 2: Not that I know of.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My grandmother was, my maternal grandmother was very fair skinned.  So I'm sure that there was, you know, something going on there at that point.
Speaker 1: They never talked about it?
Speaker 2: They never talked about it.  And then I don't know anything--I know both her parents were African American.  Beyond that, just looking at her skin tone and the skin tone of her siblings and the rest of her family, there had to be something in there (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) How many siblings were in your--with your mother?
Speaker 2: Well, my mother had just her brother, her twin brother.  But my--
Speaker 1: So, there were only two children?
Speaker 2: Only two children.  However, my grandmother, I believe--I want to say there were ten kids.  Yeah, she was one of ten.
Speaker 1: Okay, and they all, they all stayed then in St. Louis?  Or are they spread out?
Speaker 2: No, they all moved.  And I don't know a lot about, I don't know a lot about them.  I do know that some left; in fact, most left.  I think by the time I came along, which was 1960, the only one still in St. Louis was my grandmother.
Story_ID: 500744
Speaker 1: What did your mother [Julia Hamilton Mitchell] have to say about education and the value of an education?
Speaker 2: Oh, she always said it was very important.  She, I mean she grew up with educators, and she was an educator herself.  She told me that's one thing no one can ever take away from you is education.  And she would always get on me about doing my best in school.  And you know, having your mom as a schoolteacher has its advantages and disadvantages because--.  The advantages are obvious, you know; she was obviously skilled at teaching people.  But the disadvantage is that she can call your teacher and have one of those professional conversations (laughter) with her, with him or her about you.  So she, education was always very important in my family.
Speaker 1: Now, was your mother--your mother must have taught in a segregated school in St. Louis [Missouri]?
Speaker 2: I, I don't bel-
Speaker 1: How was it?
Speaker 2: I don't believe she did.  She started teaching in the late '50s [1950s] in St. Louis and retired in the, the mid-'80s [1980s].  I don't remember, I certainly don't remember her teaching in a segregated school.  She was, she did teach in the inner city.  And I guess I re- can recall going to school with her.  There was kind of a de facto segregation.  Whereas most of the kids were African American there were one or two whites.  There were a few Asian students as well.  And, but that was just by nature of where the school was, and the makeup of the school (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And what was the name of the school she taught at?
Speaker 2: She taught at several schools in St. Louis.  The one that comes to mind is (background noise) one called Clark Branch.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: Do you want me to say that again (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, just go ahead.  One was Clark--
Speaker 2: Sure.  She taught at, one of them was Clark Branch School in St. Louis, and she taught at several in the district.  But that's the only one I can think of.
Story_ID: 500745
Speaker 1: My--we were talking about my maternal grandparents.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: My grandfather [Edward DePass Hamilton] was a--taught at How- at Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.].  And he was also a principal in the St. Louis [Missouri] school system.  In fact, he was the principal for years, I want to say twenty-five years at the same school in St. Louis.  It's Simmons elementary school [Edward J. Simmons School] in St. Louis.  My grandmother [Julia Hamilton] was also a teacher in the St. Louis Public Schools.
Speaker 2: Do you know who that school was named after, Simmons?
Speaker 1: I don't.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I don't, I really don't.
Speaker 2: Because there's a famous Simmons in Mississippi, Professor Simmons [sic. Roscoe Simmons].  And he, his legacy, like he was half-brothers with--or he was related to Booker T. Washington.
Speaker 1: Oh, really, okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) They mar- I mean they married sisters.  So they were kind of brothers-in-law [sic.].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But he was a very significant man throughout the South, and I was just wondering if it's the same--
Speaker 1: Interesting.
Speaker 2: --Simmons.
Speaker 1: I don't know.  It was a very important school in the St. Louis area for the longest time.  Because during the days of segregation it was the black elementary school.  So, subsequently many of the people from my parents' generation all knew each other because they all came through--
Speaker 2: From Simmons.
Speaker 1: --the Simmons School.  In fact, my mother [Julia Hamilton Mitchell] and my father [Lowell Mitchell] met at Simmons School and they were in the third grade as, as students.
Story_ID: 500746
Speaker 1: Let's talk about your father's side of the family.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Your father's full name?
Speaker 2: Lowell Edward Mitchell [Lowell Mitchell].  Lowell is L-O-W-E-L-L, Edward, and Mitchell, M-I-T-C-H-E-L-L, same as mine.
Speaker 1: But he was from the Carolinas?
Speaker 2: No, that's my [maternal] grandfather [Edward DePass Hamilton] from the Carolinas, no (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That's your grandfather, okay.
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: Your father was from?
Speaker 2: My father was born in St. Louis, Missouri on April 14th, 1933.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what did he do for a living?
Speaker 2: He was a systems analyst at McDonnell Douglas, which was a defense contractor in St. Louis [Missouri], which is now owned by the Boeing corporation [The Boeing Company].  But he worked at McDonnell Douglas for about thirty years having a variety of jobs.  But the last ten years of his career he worked as a systems analyst there.  And before that he worked with my grandfather.  My grandfather whose name is Russell Lowell Mitchell.
Speaker 1: Your paternal?
Speaker 2: My, my, my paternal grandfather is Russell Lowell Mitchell.  He owned a vacuum cleaner and sewing machine repair shop in St. Louis for about fifty years.  So for a while my dad worked with him.
Speaker 1: And where was that shop located?
Speaker 2: In St. Louis, Missouri on Easton Avenue, which later became Martin Luther King Boulevard [sic. Dr. Martin Luther King Drive].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, the history of St. Louis, was St. Louis ever like legally segregated in the sense that there was a black community which had its own shops and its main streets and sort of thrived?
Speaker 2: I don't think it was legally segregated, but certainly there was--.  St. Louis at one time--I don't know what it's like now--but at one time St. Louis was called by I want to say the [U.S.] Census Bureau the most segregated city in the country because there was a area of St. Louis, North St. Louis, where the predominately, which was predominately black, and then South St. Louis which was predominately white.  I think it's a lot different now.  I thi- I don't think it's quite as segregated.  But certainly where my grandfather's shop was was the heart of the black community.  You know, on Easton Avenue there was my grandfather and there were a couple of other guys on the street.  There was an auto repair guy, there was a, there was a grocery store.  I can remember that it definitely was the heart of the black community.  And as a child going down there we would stop at White Castle first (laughter) and then, have, have, have breakfast and then go to his shop.  So St. Louis was, I mean at one time was, you know, clearly a segregated town.
Speaker 1: So your father's memories of his childhood, did he ever talk about what his childhood was like?
Speaker 2: He spoke also of things he couldn't do.  My father--
Speaker 1: Things he couldn't he do.
Speaker 2: I mean, he didn't really speak of it unless I asked him.  But I went to the University of Missouri in Columbia, Missouri.  And my father went to Lincoln University in Jefferson City, Missouri.  When my father went to college, he couldn't go to University of Missouri in Columbia because they didn't allow black students.  Lincoln University was the state college for black kids.  And I can remember telling him when I was in school talking to some of the students from the Middle East, who would talk about how their parents were there in the '40s [1940s] and '50s [1950s].  And I remember thinking, gosh, these guys would come from Syria and Lebanon and that part of the world, and they could go to school here.  But my father, who grew up 125 miles down the road, was not allowed to go to school at the University of Missouri; he went to Lincoln University, which was a great school.  But it was just fascinating to me that it was like that.
Story_ID: 500747
Speaker 1: On your father's [Lowell Mitchell] side, how far back can you go?
Speaker 2: I can go back on my, my--let's start with my paternal grandfather [Russell Lowell Mitchell].
Speaker 1: And he owned the vacuum cleaner store [in St. Louis, Missouri]?
Speaker 2: Owned the vacuum cleaner store.  His father was a guy named Russell Watkins [ph.], who was a Jewish guy who left the family at some point.  And my great-grandmother, my paternal grandmother's--grandfather's mother, remarried a guy whose last name was Mitchell.  And my grandfather (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And what did he look like?  (Unclear).
Speaker 2: I--yeah, yeah, I never knew him.  But his, my grandfather took his name, Mitchell.  So, I do know that's about as far back as I go right there with him.  But I do know that there, there was always talk that his, that my great-grandfather was a Jewish guy; I don't know much about him at all.  And my grandfather, at times when got with him, he would be mistaken by some people as--some people would say, "Are you Jewish?"  And I never got that until I got older, and he explained to me the background there.  But that's about as far back as I go with him.  I don't know anything about anyone beyond my great-grandmother on my paternal grandfather's side.
Speaker 1: So, what are your earliest memories of your own childhood in St. Louis [Missouri]?
Speaker 2: Well, even to my grandmother [Cozene Mitchell]--I didn't--I left my grandmother out.  Do you want me to talks about that, or (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, yeah, I want you to talk about her, yeah, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, my, my paternal grandmother was from Kentucky originally.  In fact, my paternal grandfather was born in Indiana and came to St. Louis after marrying my grandmother [sic.] in Kentucky.  She was seventeen when they got married in Kentucky.  But she, she was from Providence, Kentucky, a little town right outside of Evansville, Indiana.  I knew my great-grandparents on her side.
Speaker 1: Who were they?
Speaker 2: Laurine, and this is--oh, my aunts right now is like--has a baseball bat and she wants to hit me in the head with it.  (Laughter) I cannot remember my great-grandfather's name [Gene Couch].  We called them Mama and Papa.  But Laurine Couch, C-O- like couch, like you sit on the couch.  And oh my god, I can't remember my great-grandfather's name, but he was, he died when I was very young.  But they lived in Kentucky as well.  I don't know any- about anybody prior to that.
Speaker 1: So, what did they do for a living?
Speaker 2: I don't know, to be honest with you.
Speaker 1: What do you remember seeing them do?
Speaker 2: You know what?  By the time I came along, they were so old.  They lived in this house in I want to say the woods in Kentucky.  They had lots of land.  They had chickens in the back.  They had ducks and hogs running around as well.  But I don't know (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Have you been to the property as an adult to see what it looked like?
Speaker 2: The last time I was there I was about twenty-five years old when my great-grandmother passed away.
Speaker 1: And what did it look like then as an adult?
Speaker 2: It looked just the same way without the animals.  When my great-grandmother passed away, we went there and saw it.  But I really don't know what they did for a living.  That's a really good question.
Speaker 1: And then they must have been b- were they born into slavery?  No.
Speaker 2: No, they were not born--
Speaker 1: They were born--
Speaker 2: They would been--
Speaker 1: --in the 1900s.
Speaker 2: Right.  They were born in--
Speaker 1: Like 19-?
Speaker 2: No, no, they--my great-grand--
Speaker 1: Turn of the century.
Speaker 2: My great-grandparents were born in the 1800s.  But I don't, I--they were not born into slavery.
Speaker 1: They were born late 1800s--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I want to say--
Speaker 1: --like 1880s.
Speaker 2: I'm going to guess.  I'm going to guess--yeah, that's probably right.  My, my grandmother was born in 1909.  So yeah, they were born--you know, I don't know, in the 1870s, 1880s, I'm not real sure.  But I don't know anything beyond, beyond that.  But I remember going to see Mama and Papa Couch in Kentucky (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) But do you know how they acquired the property or the land?
Speaker 2: I really don't.  I (unclear).
Speaker 1: Did the land stay in the family?
Speaker 2: Land stayed in the family, yes.  When they passed away the land went to my, I guess my aunt and uncle.  My grandmother had four siblings, and I think the property went to, to their kids.  Because by that time I think most of the, my grandmother's descendants, her, her sons certainly had passed away.  So, I want to say that the land went to family members on another side of the family.
Story_ID: 500748
Speaker 1: So, your earliest memories of your own childhood in St. Louis [Missouri]?
Speaker 2: You know, my earliest memory, and I was talking to--we did a story on memory.  And it's funny, I told somebody my first memory of life was the day that JFK [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy] was assassinated.  It was November of course, 1963, I was three years old.  My mother [Julia Hamilton Mitchell] was crying in the next room, and I remember asking her, "What's wrong?"  And she said, "The president's been shot."  And I recall asking her, "So, what happens now?"  But I think of that day probably because I saw my mother in a way that, you know, certainly disturbed me.
Speaker 1: But that's extremely interesting (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I remember that.
Speaker 1: --also because you became a journalist.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: And your first memory is of this big story.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, it was something.  It's interesting, I think my memory of it is more attuned to what my mother was doing at the time, and less attuned to what actually was happening.
Speaker 1: Of course, yeah.
Speaker 2: But, but yeah, and it's my first memory in life.  I can remember in St. Louis we lived on San Francisco Avenue, and we lived in a two family flat.  And next door was great: my grandmother and grandfather, my paternal grandmother [Cozene Mitchell] and grandfather [Russell Lowell Mitchell] lived on the f- top floor--on the bottom floor rather.  And my aunt and uncle and their two kids, my cousins, my father's sister, lived on the upstairs.  So, it was fantastic, we were all together.  I can remember it being--six or seven years old and just going out and just having instant playmates 'cause it was so much fun.
Story_ID: 500749
Speaker 1: We're talking about the neighborhood.  Who were the neighbors on either side of you?  Who were the community leaders within the neighborhood?  And we will--and where did you go to church?
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: We'll talk about those things.
Speaker 2: I was seven, I was six years old when we moved, so I don't remember really who the community leaders were.  I remember across the street there were the Butlers [ph.], and down the street there were the Saddlers [ph.].  And down on the other side of the street there were the Washingtons [ph.].  And they all had kids, and they were, you know, people that I grew up with (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) But do you remember what those families did for a living?  I'm trying to--
Speaker 2: Let's see--
Speaker 1: Like was it a middle-class neighborhood?  Upper middle-class?  Okay.
Speaker 2: It was a middle-class neighborhood.  And at the time--we're talking about the mid-'60s [1960s] in St. Louis [Missouri].  It was a middle-class neighborhood.  It was in North St. Louis [St. Louis, Missouri], right across from the park, the Fairgrounds Park [sic. Fairground Park].  And my memories of it are just magical.  I really enjoyed living there, and in fact I couldn't believe why we moved to the county.  My father [Lowell Mitchell] explained to me later that at that time the neighborhood was starting to get bad.  It's much better now, but that's why, you know, we moved.  And within a year of us moving, I want to say that my aunt and uncle moved and my [paternal] grandparents [Cozene Mitchell and Russell Lowell Mitchell] moved to St. Louis County [Missouri] as well.  But I have great memories of that street, San Francisco Avenue.  I was the youngest kid on the block with all the other kids.  So I would--not get picked on, but you know, when you're a kid they kind of leave you out of things (laughter).  But I just remember so many great things about living there, and the fact that my family was so close by.  We went to All Saints Church [All Saints Episcopal Church], which was an Episcopal church in St. Louis, Missouri.  And in fact, I was baptized there, and my seventeen year old daughter [Ashley Mitchell] was baptized there some twenty-nine years later.
Speaker 1: Very nice.  So, did the family go to church often?  Was it something--
Speaker 2: No--
Speaker 1: How religious--
Speaker 2: We were what you called C and E kids.  Christmas and Easter we would usually (laughter) make an appearance.  My mother [Julia Hamilton Mitchell] would go more often, but we would--the kids--and I'm five years older than my next closest sibling, so (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) How many siblings do you have?
Speaker 2: I've got two [Christy Mitchell Madison and Michael Mitchell].
Story_ID: 500750
Speaker 1: I've got a brother [Michael Mitchell] and a sister [Christy Mitchell Madison].
Speaker 2: And what are they, just briefly, what are they doing now?
Speaker 1: My sister is in Kansas City [Missouri].  She's a homemaker, she has three kids.  And my brother works for a relocation company.  He lives in Chicago [Illinois].  He's married with two kids.
Speaker 2: And what do they think about what you're doing?
Speaker 1: You know, it's funny.  They've always, they've always known this is something I've wanted to do, so I think they're very happy for me.  Very funny story, my first time on television I was in Columbia, Missouri [at the University of Missouri].  I'm jumping ahead, but this has to deal with what we're talking about here.  My brother must have been thirteen years old at the time.  Anyway, St. Lou- I grew up in St. Louis [Missouri], which is 125 miles from Columbia.  These were the days before cable television.  For whatever reason, the atmospheric conditions were such where my parents [Julia Hamilton Mitchell and Lowell Mitchell], at their house, could see my news cut-in that I had done you know one morning, it was my first time on television.  So, I drove to to St. Louis.  First of all, the news cut-in was horrible, but I didn't notice how bad it was (laughter).  I thought it was pretty good, actually.  So I was driving to St. Louis, and for whatever reason, with every mile in my head anyway, this cut-in got better and better and better.  So by the time I walked in my house, I was feeling good about myself.  My brother, thirteen years old at the time, had left a note on my bed, and said, "We watched you this morning, you were real bad."  (Laughter) Kind of, kind of put it all in perspective right there.  The thing is he still sends me notes like that (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) (Laughter) That's good.
Speaker 1: You know, I think they've always known this is something I wanted to do.  And I think they're very happy that I get the chance to do it.
Story_ID: 500751
Speaker 1: So in the neighborhood [North St. Louis, St. Louis, Missouri], you said you couldn't remember who the leaders were.  But who came to visit your parents?
Speaker 2: I want to say the Saddlers [ph.] would come.  They were--the Saddlers (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And what did they do for a living?
Speaker 2: Gosh, what did Mr. Saddler do?  I'm not real sure.  I'm not sure what Mr. Saddler did.
Speaker 1: Can you remember what he talked about with your father?
Speaker 2: You know what?  He--Mr. Saddler played tennis, I remember that.  And my father always wanted to play tennis.  And he and Mr. Saddler would ten- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So what year is this?
Speaker 2: This is 1966.
Speaker 1: Sixty-six [1966].
Speaker 2: And that's when we moved [to St. Louis County, Missouri], '66 [1966].  So this could have been '64 [1964] to '66 [1966].
Speaker 1: And he played tennis?
Speaker 2: Mr. Saddler played tennis.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He was, he was a pretty good tennis player.  My father wanted to play tennis, but he never, he didn't start playing until later.  So I remember Mr. Saddler coming over saying, "Yeah, man, Lowell [Lowell Mitchell], you got to get out there.  It's great exercise, you know, you got to play."  I remember Mr. Butler [ph.] down the street who had a really cool Chevy Impala [Chevrolet Impala], a convertible, one of those that today would go for about a hundred thousand dollars (laughter) if it was in good shape.  I went to Ashland Branch school [St. Louis, Missouri] for kindergarten, and the first half of first grade before moved, then I walked home from school every day.  And this must have been--of course it--now it seems like three miles.  But it was probably, you know, four or five blocks.  But as a kid, four or five years old, I was walking home from school.  I didn't think (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Were there any--
Speaker 2: And I didn't think--
Speaker 1: Go ahead.
Speaker 2: I didn't much of it, either.  I'd walk home--some of my friends would walk home as well.  But I mean when I look back on it, I was pretty--you know, in those days, kids I think were a lot more independent than they are now.  My mother [Julia Hamilton Mitchell] taught; my mother worked and my father worked as well.  So I would come home from school and I'd be at home by myself for, you know, an hour or so.  Again, I had my [paternal] grandparents [Cozene Mitchell and Russell Lowell Mitchell] and my aunt and uncle next door.  We had Mrs. Randall [ph.] upstairs who looked after me if something happened (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So within your neighborhood would you say that it was most common to have two parents in the home or less common at the time?
Speaker 2: I think so, at that time.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: What I remember about it--
Speaker 1: What you remember is that--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I remember--
Speaker 1: --there were two parents in most of the homes?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's, from what I remember, yes.  And again, we're talking about the mid-'60s [1960s].
Speaker 1: The mid-si- yeah.
Speaker 2: And you know, most of the kids--if I was six years old, most of the kids were eight or nine or ten.  Again, I was the youngest kid of the group.
Story_ID: 500752
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So were there teachers at that first school that you attended, the pre-K [kindergarten] and half of the first grade (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: --that made impressions on you?
Speaker 2: Mrs. Burgdorf [ph.], Mrs. Burgdorf was my kindergarten teacher.  And when I say she made an impression on me, I guess--she was very disciplined.  And I remember one Christmas we could bring our toys to school for one day.  And Mrs. Burgdorf said, "No guns.  You can't bring any toy guns."  And I had a .007 you know toy gun that I was so proud of.  Mrs. Burgdorf wouldn't let us play Batman outside--'Batman' was a big show--because it was too violent.  And what I remember about Mrs. Burgdorf--and at the time I remember thinking this woman is, you know, what's her problem?  But she was very disciplined.  And as I've grown older I've come to appreciate people who are that disciplined, who were that old fashioned, who stick to their guns, who, you know, who embrace their history and the good things in life (laughter) and run with it.
Speaker 1: Now was she Jewish?
Speaker 2: I don't believe so.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We never really talked about it (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I mean six years old (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right, right.
Speaker 2: --you don't think about those kind of things.
Speaker 1: But when you say she embraced her history what does that mean?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, it's probably the incorrect way to say it, but she embraced what was important to her.  I mean, you know, guns were bad.  Therefore you weren't going to bring toy guns into school.  And I mean today the thought of bringing a toy gun into a school is, I mean, forget about it.  Now I'm talking, you know, forty years ago.  It wasn't a big deal; I mean pe- everybody had a toy gun back then.
Speaker 1: Now was she white?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, Mrs. Burgdorf was white.  And my Aunt Marie [ph.], we called her Re-Re, was a substitute teacher in the St. Louis Public School District [St. Louis Public Schools].  And occasionally, she would teach at Ashland Branch school [St. Louis, Missouri].  And I can remember being so embarrassed when she would come up to me and kiss me in the middle of class, or ask me a question and I'd get it wrong, and she'd come kiss me anyway (laughter).  Or she'd want to walk home with me (laughter), and I remember thinking this is so embarrassing.  But you know, I look back on it, it really was just a magical time in life because the family was right there, and the community I think was very close.
Story_ID: 500753
Speaker 1: When the family moved, why did you move to the county [St. Louis County, Missouri]?
Speaker 2: We moved to the county, I don't know the specific reason.  I think at the time my dad [Lowell Mitchell] thought that, or my family thought the neighborhood [North St. Louis, St. Louis, Missouri] was, you know, probably going to get bad soon.  'Cause things were happening in the neighborhood (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So you, I mean, but the white flight was taking place?  People were leaving?
Speaker 2: There were a lot of blacks, a lot of blacks in our community were moving to the suburbs.
Speaker 1: To the suburbs.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think we were like the fourth or fifth family, you know, to do that.
Speaker 1: But you would have been new to the suburbs.  You would have been one of a few black families then.
Speaker 2: On our particular block where we moved we were the second black family to move in.
Speaker 1: Was that a noticeable change from what you'd experienced in the inner city of St. Louis [Missouri]?
Speaker 2: I didn't really think--you know, I really didn't think about it.  To be totally honest with you, I really didn't think much about it.  I know that the Altmyers [ph.] lived across the street, and Freddy Altmyer [ph.] became my friend.  And Robbie Barge [ph.] lived door, and Robbie became my friend.  I never thought much about it.  But as the years went on, Freddy moved, Robbie moved, and you know, and for years the neighborhood was all African American.  So we were the second African Americans on the block.  And you know, at the time you don't think about, you know, what's going on.  And you know, (laughter) as you move in, other people move out (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Did your father socialize with the people that you were friends with?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Like the people--so it became, it was seamless.  You never saw a difference from--
Speaker 2: It was--I never saw, I never saw a difference at all.  I never--it was not until later that I really was aware I guess to the point where it was a problem.
Speaker 1: But later, meaning how old were you?
Speaker 2: I want to say I was eight or nine years old.  And it really, and that really wasn't the neighborhood when I noticed--.  There was, there was one incident I'll never forget.  I was at a friend's house who did not live in the neighborhood, a white guy, probably my best friend at the time.  We were in his basement, and it's myself, my friend, and his sister, who was younger, and she came downstairs to play for a while.  And you know, we didn't want any girls playing with us.  Anyway, she ran back upstairs and she came back.  And she said, "Grandmother doesn't want me coming downstairs and playing anymore, because she doesn't like me playing with a colored boy."  And I have to be honest with you, I didn't know what that meant.  I didn't know--I think my response was, "Oh, is there a colored boy here?"  (Laughter) I didn't know what that meant, a colored boy.  And of course I went home and told my parents, who, you know, were furious.  And they called his family up and said, "What's going on?  I'm not going to let my son come over there anymore."  And they profusely apologized.  But it was the first time that I had experienced somebody telling me point blank, you're different and you can't do this.  "I can't play with you.  You're not welcome over here."  And I want to say I was eight or nine years old when that happened.  So, as a kid, I, we really--I mean when you say socialize, I don't know if my dad socialized, but he certainly, you know, talked to them and we, you know, we would see them out in the street as neighbors and things like that.  I don't recall (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Did that change you at all?  I mean that--I mean, I don't know, I'm asking--
Speaker 2: That incident?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  But it's--
Speaker 2: I don't know if the incident changed me per se but it certainly made me more aware--
Speaker 1: More aware.
Speaker 2: --of some things.
Speaker 1: And what did you see after that that may have been there before that you didn't see because your eyes hadn't been opened to it?  Did you see things after that?  I mean, still as an eight or nine year old, I'm talking about.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I don't think--
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: I don't recall if I remember seeing anything in particular at that point, but I was certainly more aware of things.
Speaker 1: How--
Speaker 2: I can remember--
Speaker 1: How did you tell your parents?  Did you just say, "Oh, she called me a colored boy?"
Speaker 2: No.  By the time I got home--
Speaker 1: You knew?
Speaker 2: --I figured it wasn't a good thing.
Speaker 1: Oh, you knew.  Okay.  All right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I figured--by the time I got home I figured--I didn't know exactly what it was.  Well, I knew what it was, but I knew it wasn't a good thing, I told my parents.
Speaker 1: So you were notorious for using the time to get home to--
Speaker 2: Yeah, to kind of figure it out--
Speaker 1: --think about things--
Speaker 2: --and then--
Speaker 1: --in your head.
Speaker 2: And I remember telling them and they were, of course, were furious.  I remember another incident in my backyard.  We had a big backyard, and it butted up to some woods.  And there was a kid back there, I don't remember his name, that I used to play with occasionally.  And he was talking to two other kids, and they were talking very loud, very loudly.  And I was standing at the fence just watching them play.  They didn't see me.  And I heard the one guy say, "Too many niggers.  Niggers live up here, niggers live up here, and niggers up here."  And I remember looking at them, and I knew exactly what that meant.  And they looked at me.  And I want to say they were twenty-five yards away, and there was nothing but silence as we just kind of stood and looked at each other.  This was not long after the colored incident.  And yeah, you know, those things happened, you start looking at things a lot differently than perhaps you looked at them before.
Story_ID: 500754
Speaker 1: We were talking about just the incident in the backyard in the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.  I mean those kind of things, I mean just kind of let you know that you're different.  I mean, there was nobody saying I couldn't do anything.  Nobody saying I couldn't go to this movie theater, "I'm not going to serve you," or like--anything like that, like my parents [Julia Hamilton Mitchell and Lowell Mitchell] and grandparents had to deal with.
Speaker 1: But then there's one time when the police said to you, "Hey, kids, you should go back to your own neighborhood."
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: When you were living--you were at home.
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Exactly.  Yeah, that would happen.  That happened a couple of times growing up.
Speaker 1: Now, what would your parents say or think about what they, what you were being exposed to now versus this never happened in inner city St. Louis [Missouri]?
Speaker 2: Oh, they were being--I mean I was so young.  It could have happened there, I just wasn't aware of it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My father in fact would tell me a story that I don't remember.  But we went to a restaurant chain that was known for giving you a frosty mug of root beer.  And he told the story years later of how he took myself and my cousin, who's three years older than I am, to this restaurant.  And it was a dri- at the time they had, not drive-throughs, but the carhops would come over, and we ordered root beer.  I must have been two, I don't know.  And they brought over our root beer, not in a frosty mug, but in a styrofoam cup.  And apparently when my father questioned that, he said, "Well, where's the frosty mug?"  They said, "Oh, we don't, we don't serve colored people with frosty mugs.  You get styrofoam cups."  (Laughter) To which my father promptly--you know, I think he--my father was the calmest guy in the world.  I believe the story goes that he told them what to do with the styrofoam cup (laughter) and we left.  So, those things happened.  I just wasn't, you know, privy to them, you know, at that, you know, particular time.  My mother tells me, used to tell a great story.  And I don't know if this is just Mom, you know, bragging that her--she thinks her child could read at a young age, or what.  But she said she knew that I could read because there was a newspaper in St. Louis called the Evening Whirl [St. Louis Evening Whirl].  And if you haven't seen it, I advise you to go out and get a copy.  It's a sensational newspaper, it's in the black community.  But it's fun to read, it's very sensational, it's very crime-driven.  And anyway there was--I must have gone to my mother and I said, "Mom, why was this man arrested for dancing?"  And my mother said, "What are you talking about?"  And I brought the Evening Whirl over, and she said I said, "See, this man was arrested for dan- arrested for dancing."  And apparently a guy who was on a cruise ship on the Mississippi River was arrested for dancing with a white woman (laughter).  And I read this in the Evening Whirl.  I mean, my--God bless their soul.  My parents would be so angry if they knew that I told people that they let me read the Evening Whirl (laughter) that they left the Evening Whirl around for me to read it.  But again I mean these were all things that, you know, that was how my mother knew that I could read.  So it was all around.  But I was just very young.  It was only when I got older and moved, you know, to the suburbs--.  And again, we were dealing with a much more diverse population there.  We were the, we were the exceptions, and we were in St. Louis County [Missouri].  So, so (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) How long did it take for that neighborhood to change from just being two families to being the reverse?
Speaker 2: I don't know.  I want to say over the course of five years.  And there were a couple of white families--
Speaker 1: But that's a short period of time.
Speaker 2: There were a couple of white families still in the neighborhood.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: But, but there was a clear change.  And when you're that age, you don't really, you don't put it in terms of, oh, why are these white people leaving?  You say, "Oh, why is my buddy Freddy [Freddy Altmyer (ph.)] leaving?  Why is my buddy Robbie [Robbie Barge (ph.)] leaving?"  You don't look at it in terms of white flight, and I'm not sure that's what it was in the particular cases I just said.  But, but yeah when you get older you certainly, you know, look around and go what's going on here, and why has the neighborhood changed so much?  It was a great neighborhood, but it definitely changed.
Story_ID: 500755
Speaker 1: So we were talking about elementary school.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: I want to know what were you reading in elementary, like what newspapers were in the home, what magazines were in the home?
Speaker 2: I remember the St. Louis Post-Dispatch being in the home, which is the town newspaper.
Speaker 1: How good is that paper?
Speaker 2: It's a good paper.  You know, I can't speak of it today, but you know for years it was owned by the Pulitzer family.  It was great newspaper.  It was, St. Louis [Missouri] at one time was a two newspaper town.  It was the--
Speaker 1: Dispatch?
Speaker 2: --Post-Dispatch and the Globe-Democrat [St. Louis Globe-Democrat], which was the more conservative newspaper.  The Globe went out of business I want to say in the mid-'80s [1980s] for the last time.  You know it came in and out of business over the years.  But the Post was a pretty good paper.  I can remember reading that.
Speaker 1: Now--
Speaker 2: And I remember Ebony magazine being in the house, and--
Speaker 1: And being--go ahead.  Just--
Speaker 2: I remember Jet magazine, you know, being in the house.  I remember the St. Louis Argus, which is a black newspaper, being in the house.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I was going to ask if they--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: But what was the other paper that you said was the black paper that--
Speaker 2: Well, the Evening Whirl [St. Louis Evening Whirl].
Speaker 1: The Evening Whirl.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I--
Speaker 1: So, St. Louis had two black newspapers?
Speaker 2: St. Louis has a very rich history when it comes to black journ- blacks in journalism.
Speaker 1: Can you tell me about the history?
Speaker 2: There was the St. Louis Sentinel, which is a black newspaper; the St. Louis Argus, which is a black newspaper; the St. Louis American, which is a black newspaper; the Evening Whirl, which was kind of in a world of its own (laughter).  But, but there were three, I want to say three, the Argus, the Sentinel, the American; three very solid mainstream if you will you know black newspapers in St. Louis (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) How could the town support three black newspapers?
Speaker 2: It's amazing now when you think about it.  But they, the papers did very well.  I know the American is still publishing.  I don't know about the Argus or the Sentinel.  But it was (unclear)--
Speaker 1: Daily or weekly?
Speaker 2: It was weekly.
Speaker 1: They're weekly, okay.
Speaker 2: Every--weekly, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.
Speaker 2: And I believe they were always weekly.  But yeah, St. Louis has a very rich tradition with African Americans in journalism.
Speaker 1: So, but then that means they had African American journalists--
Speaker 2: Um-hm, yeah.
Speaker 1: --writing for these papers?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  You talked to people--there's a Gregory Freeman [Greg Freeman] who later became an editor for the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, was an editor at the St. Louis American.  A lot of times these papers served as launching boards for people, certainly later on.  You'd get your start at a black newspaper, and eventually you'd move on to a mainstream paper.  I want to say Michael Cheers [D. Michael Cheers], who is a, I don't know where Michael is now.  But Michael was at a black newspaper at one time.  [HistoryMaker] George Curry I believe worked at a black newspaper at one time as well.  And George Curry also worked at the St. Louis Post-Dispatch.  Gerald Boyd [Gerald M. Boyd] worked at I believe a black newspaper as well.  So, the black newspapers in St. Louis in particular I think really served as a launching board for a lot of folks who became legends in the business later.
Speaker 1: Now why do you think St. Louis could support four?
Speaker 2: I don't know.  It's a great question.  And until you just brought it up, I never thought about it.  But that is a lot.  The Evening Whirl, I'm going to put it in that category, but I really shouldn't because it's (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Like the New York Post?  Maybe more sensational?
Speaker 2: Maybe more sensational than the New York Post (laughter).
Speaker 1: Because there is a Spanish newspaper th- I can't remember the name of, but they always complained that you can wring out the blood it's so filled with violence and mayhem.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, the Earl--the Whirl is like that.  It's actually, it's, I haven't seen it in a long time, but it's one of those papers where you kind of, you kind of put a paper bag over your head and say, no, it wasn't me reading the (laughter) the Evening Whirl because it's that kind of, that kind of journalism (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) But being--
Story_ID: 500756
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Being surrounded by educators I'm sure having things in the house were important to r- having things in the house to read were extremely important.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.  No, we had always had Ebony magazine in the house.  Time magazine we would get every week.  I remember, you know, very--being very young and reading that (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What books do you remember seeing your parents [Julia Hamilton Mitchell and Lowell Mitchell] reading?
Speaker 2: Gosh, you know, I don't remember.  I remember reading a book--my mother gave me a book called 'Jubilee' [Margaret Walker], which if you saw 'Roots'--
Speaker 1: Is it a children's book?
Speaker 2: No, not a children's book.  I must have been in my late, I must have been eight or nine, ten years old.  It was a book about slavery.  It was similar to the 'Roots' story, only it involved another family.  And you know, I think some would argue that 'Jubilee' was, was Alex Haley's 'Roots' ['Roots: The Saga of an American Family'] and 'Jubilee' could have been, you know, a companion book because they were very similar.  There was another book I remember my parents giving me called 'The Wife of His Youth' [Charles W. Chesnutt].  And it was about some blue bloods from, who I guess who passed in Philadelphia [sic.] during slavery times.
Speaker 1: For whites?
Speaker 2: For whites.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And one of the, one of the--and they were all slaves, but some of them escaped and made it to Philadelphia where they had this secret society [Blue Vein Society] where they passed.  And the story ends with this, the blue blood, the blue blood of the community, he had a big soiree, and upon opening the door there was this woman, a slave who had just escaped who was not a blue blood, and saying to him, "I'm the wife of your youth."  And it was a great book.  I remember her, you know, I remember her, you know, giving me that book as well.  So yeah, I mean there was always reading material in the house.  And whenever there was something on television, they would (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Why do you think she gave you that book?
Speaker 2: I don't know.  I think it was something that she had read at one time.  I don't think there was any hidden--
Speaker 1: There was no, like, okay, there are blue bloods in our family?  And--
Speaker 2: Oh no, no, no, no, there certainly--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No, that wasn't the case in our family (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But, but no, it wasn't anything like that.  I think it was just, "You'll find this interesting."  And I name those two books because they were--those are the ones that really (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That stands out, yeah.
Speaker 2: --that really stood out in my mind.
Story_ID: 500757
Speaker 1: But also if there was anything on television, anything that, you know, that was historical, or anything that they thought that I should know, they would sit me down in front of the TV (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) For example?  Let's talk, what did you watch?
Speaker 1: I can remember back in it must have been 1973 the Watergate hearings.  Them making me sit down and watch the Watergate hearings, especially when Barbara Jordan was on.  My mother [Julia Hamilton Mitchell] would come in, "Barbara Jordan's on."  I'm like thirteen years old, you know, what would I care about Barbara Jordan.  But I remember sitting there and watching her, and just being, you know, just enthralled by her, and then becoming enthralled by the whole political process.  When Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was assassinated in 1968, they sat me down, "We're going to watch this.  We're going to watch the funeral, we're going to watch what happens here."  I remember the day he was, I remember that day too.  I was sitting at home.
Speaker 2: Tell me about that day.
Speaker 1: I was, I was just at home, and it was a--I don't know, it was a weekday night.  I want to say it was a Tuesday, I'm not sure.  But I was watching TV and there was a news bulletin that said Martin Luther King had been assassinated, and I remember telling my mother.  And I had v- knowledge of who Martin Luther King was.  Certainly not, you know, an extensive knowledge of who he was, but I certainly knew.  And it reminded me, reminded me of, you know, five years earlier when John F. Kennedy [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy] was assassinated.  It was interesting.  For somebody of my age, forty-seven, the first--.  Gosh, whenever you would say, whenever I would see a special report on television, whenever I would see, "This is a CBS News special report," or "An NB- ABC News special report," I assumed somebody was dead.  Because for the first certainly ten years of my life that's what happened, and that stuck with me until probably the early, the early '80s [1980s].  I remember being in college [University of Missouri, Columbia, Missouri] and watching when the pope [Saint Pope John Paul II] was shot, watching Dan Rather when the pope was shot.  And then when I started doing this and I would do special reports, I went wow, somebody at home is thinking that the worst thing in the world is happening right now.  And I think people of my generation, when you, if you were conscious of news and what was happening, that's what you thought.  Whenever you saw a bulletin on television it meant that somebody was shot, somebody was dead.
Story_ID: 500758
Speaker 1: We're going to jump back and forth a little bit.
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: But just at this moment I want to know if you can remember the first time you saw a black person on television to the point it made an impression on you, oh, or you even noticed, there's--that guy is African American, he's on TV.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  The guy who stands out in my mind as the first African American I saw on television was a gentleman by the name of Fred Porterfield, who was a reporter--anchor in St. Louis [Missouri] at what was then KMOX [KMOX-TV; KMOV-TV], the CBS owned and operated station there.  I must have been eight or nine years old.  He actually was the second African American on St. Louis television.  The first was a woman named Dianne White [Dianne White Clatto], who was a weatherperson back in the mid-'60s [1960s].  But--
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: But I remember seeing him and saying, wow.  You know that--and I turn to my dad [Lowell Mitchell] (gesture) (laughter) you know not--.  And he said, "Yep."   He s- "Yep, yep."  Fred Porterfield.  Julius Hunter was an anchor in St. Louis for years.  Legendary guy, just left St. Louis television a few years ago.  Ed Bradley on the network level.  I remember the first time I saw him anchor a show called the 'CBS Sunday Night News,' which was a fifteen minute show that ran on Sunday nights, kind of a companion with the local news.  And I'm thinking, wow, that's pretty cool, you know.  That's something that I want to do.  And the strange thing is, I want to say thirty years later, I got that job.  I mean Ed had left, he had left years before to go to '60 Minutes.'  But, I remember thinking of that moment when I saw him do that, and I said, wow, that's not bad, that's not bad.
Speaker 1: Now did you want to do that because of what he was doing, because of who was doing it, or--?  Why did you want to do it?
Speaker 2: I think I've always been curious in terms of news.  I've always been interested in news.  I've always had the news.  But in terms of him doing it, I think when, especially in that time, when you see someone like yourself who's doing it, it kind of says to you you know what?  It's possible.  Even though your parents tell you, and my parents were great about it.  They would tell me, you can do anything in the world.  Nothing's going to hold you back.  Looking on television and seeing somebody do what you think you want to do kind of says, in your mind, you know what?  (Background noise) It is possible, it's not impossible, you know.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: And early on you liked doing it because of, telling the stories?  Telling the news?  What was it that turned you on about it?
Speaker 1: I've always been curious, and I've always enjoyed news.  I've, I enjoyed watching news, I enjoyed reading newspapers.  You know, as a child, there was something to me that's great about knowing something that nobody else knows and being able to tell it, and then the challenge of telling it in a concise way that people understand has always been something that has been interesting to me (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) What type of stories did you tell as a kid, like in elementary school, junior high?
Speaker 1: Oh, my gosh, I don't remember.
Speaker 2: Were you a storyteller then?
Speaker 1: I think, I think I was a gossip is what I was.  I probably would have been a good gossip back in those days.  But I enjoyed, at that stage of my life I think I enjoyed watching the news a lot; I enjoyed seeing what was happening around the world.  When I was a kid, there were, there was no Internet.  There wasn't, you know, CNN.  There wasn't, there weren't places where at two o'clock in the afternoon, if you wanted to know what was going on, you'd just click it on, and there it is.  So at 5:30 every day in the Midwest, we would sit down and watch Mr. Cronkite [Walter Cronkite] at dinnertime.  And it was during the Vietnam War, it was during Watergate.  These were times when a lot of things are going on in the world.  And I can remember watching and just saying, that is, I'm fascinated by how the world operates, what happens in the world.  I would love to someday be that person who gets to tell people what's going on as a reporter.  And I think--I didn't think about it, you know, very intellectually at the time, like wow, you know, I want to go to school and do this, and--.  But I think that's where I first got the bug.
Speaker 2: And how old were you then?
Speaker 1: I must have been, when I really got it, probably fifteen or sixteen.
Speaker 2: Fifteen or sixteen.
Speaker 1: What sealed the deal for me was when I was in high school [Webster Groves High School, Webster Groves, Missouri] between my junior and senior years I was invited to attend a workshop [Urban Journalism Workshop; Missouri Urban Journalism Workshop] at the University of Missouri [Columbia, Missouri] for minority students interested in journalism.  It was a two week program, and by the time, you know, I left that program two weeks later, I was totally hooked.  I said to myself, I'm going to get a job on St. Louis TV.  I was entering my senior year of high school, I said, I'm going to get a job on St. Louis TV no matter what I do.  So my cousin calls me up and tells me about an opening at a TV station [KTVI-TV] in St. Louis.  I go, "Oh, is it for a reporter?"  He goes, "No."  I go, "Is it for an anchor?"  "No."  "Is it for a photographer?"  "No."  "Producer?"  "No."  It's for the guy who answers the phone, you know, in the front.  So I took that job, and I was on the job my entire senior year of high school.  But I learned so much in that job as to how a television station operates.  I got to hang out in the newsroom after work and see how things worked out.
Speaker 2: Now was the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So, that really sealed the deal.
Speaker 2: Go ahead.  I'm sorry.
Speaker 1: That's it.
Speaker 2: Was the gentleman whose name I don't remember, but the second black person on K-
Speaker 1: Julius was not there.
Speaker 2: He was not there.
Speaker 1: There was another person there by the name of Robin Smith, who was--
Speaker 2: So, Julius had left?
Speaker 1: Julius was not at this particular station.
Speaker 2: Oh, he was at another station?
Speaker 1: Yeah, he was still in town.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay.
Speaker 1: But I didn't, I didn't know him.  But I was the night switchboard operator.
Story_ID: 500759
Speaker 1: But at the time, how many African Americans were on the news?
Speaker 2: At this point we're talking the late '70s [1970s], seventy- 1977.  There were a few, I mean in St. Louis [Missouri].  I mean, off the top of my head I think of Robin Smith; Stan Stovall, who's now in Baltimore [Maryland]; Julius [Julius Hunter].  There were a couple others.  And there were a number of photographers and editors behind the scene as well (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And what about the papers at that time?
Speaker 2: I do remember there being a number of folks on the newspaper.  I forget his first name, Sweets [Fred Sweets] was his last name, he was a photographer for the St. Louis Post-Dispatch.  St. Louis having the great history of black journalists that it does, you would attend workshops there as well, and you'd get to meet all these people, which was also an inspiration.  There was a guy named Joe Palmer [Joseph Palmer], who was also a media person in town; Betty Lee, who was in the media in town.  These were all people who, not only did you get to meet them, but they were encouraging.  And they would, you know, tell you, "You can do this as well."
Speaker 1: Now, did journalists from all over the country, African American journalists from all over, want to get to St. Louis because it was a p- a haven?
Speaker 2: That's a good question.  I'm not real sure.  And I don't know about the--I mean, the people that I mentioned, in the case of (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You mentioned a lot of people, though.
Speaker 2: In the case of Julius and Robin, they were from St. Louis.  In the case of these other folks, I'm not sure where they were from, or not--where they were from.  There was this guy George Gross [ph.] who was a reporter in St. Louis as well, at the station there.  So, I don't know if it was an attraction for a lot of St. Lou- a lot of people from around the country for that reason, or what.
Speaker 1: What type of--yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It wouldn't surprise me if it was.
Story_ID: 500760
Speaker 1: What type of a student were you?  When we were talk- we talked a little about elementary school.  Let's just say, yeah, what type of a student were you overall (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I was a decent student.  I think Gener- Colin Powell [HistoryMaker General Colin L. Powell] had a great name that I, a great phrase he--that I really admired.  He called it gentleman's Cs.  You know, that was probably me in high school [Webster Groves High School, Webster Groves, Missouri] (laughter).  I, you know, it was one of those thi- I was one of those students in high school--and again, my mom [Julia Hamilton Mitchell] was a teacher who certainly didn't help in this regard, because she would get on my case.  I could have done much better, but I was so busy doing other things.  I was trying to be on the newspaper [ECHO]; I was trying to play sports; trying to be on student council, and those kind of things.  So, I didn't apply myself to my full potential in high school.  I wasn't a bad student, I just could have done better.  In college I was a pretty good student because I think I was just so scared of, you know, failing, so (laughter).
Speaker 1: And you'd found your niche, you knew exactly what you wanted to do?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  But the first couple of years, I really, you know, I wasn't doing journalism.  The way it worked at the University of Missouri [Columbia, Missouri] at that time, you were in arts and sciences for those first two years.  But I did very well in college, and it kind of confirmed what my mother had said all those years.  If I had applied myself (laughter), you know, in high school I would have done much better.
Speaker 1: So, when you think about teachers over that whole, elementary school, junior high school, high school, the ones that stand--who stands out?
Speaker 2: The teacher that stands out most would be a woman named Susan O'Connell.  She was a journalism teacher in high school, and she is the one who encouraged me to go to this workshop at the University of Missouri [Urban Journalism Workshop; Missouri Urban Journalism Workshop] over the, the two weeks over the summer between my junior and senior years.  And she was the one I guess who first recognized, or first encouraged me from that standpoint, from a teacher's standpoint--
Speaker 1: What did (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) that you know, "I think you'd be really good at this."
Speaker 1: What did she recognize?  What do you think it was?
Speaker 2: I don't know.  I think she, I was in, I was in her journalism class, I think she thought I was a good writer.  I think she thought that I had the potential to be a good interviewer.  And I think she saw an interest there, and, and you know she told me years later that, you know, teachers don't often see that in someone, you know, who has like a real interest in something.  And I had a genuine interest, and I think she recognized that and had me, encouraged me to pursue that.  In fact, I talked to her a few years later and she said, "You know, I told your mother something one day.  I don't know if she ever told you, but you must have been eighteen years old."  And she said, "I can see him one day on CBS."  (Laughter) That's what--that was many years, many years later.  So, she was very encouraging.  And she, she stands out as somebody who I really owe a lot to.
Story_ID: 500761
Speaker 1: And in college there was a guy named Dr. Robert Knight [Robert P. Knight] who was a professor at the university who founded this workshop that--it's still there by the way.
Speaker 2: The minority workshop [Urban Journalism Workshop; Missouri Urban Journalism Workshop].
Speaker 1: Minority workshop.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: It's--
Speaker 2: Now, tell me about him founding the workshop.  Do you know the history of the workshop?
Speaker 1: I do.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: It was started back in, I want to say 1974 or 1975 by Dr. Robert Knight at the University of Missouri [Columbia, Missouri].  Dr. Knight is of Hispanic origin, and he thought that it would be great to hold a workshop at the University of Missouri School of Journalism, one of the, considered one of the best journalism schools in the country for minority students, to teach them how the business operates, to give them two weeks to write stories, to do television stories, and meet professionals in the industry.  He started that in the mid-'70s [1970s], it is still going today.  It's not called the minority workshop any more.  It's called the AHANA workshop.  And AHANA is an acronym for--
Speaker 2: Hispanic, African American (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) African American, Hispanic, yeah.
Speaker 2: Asian.
Speaker 1: Asian, yeah, Native American, yeah.
Speaker 2: Native American, okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and it's still going on today.
Speaker 2: Now was this a precursor to all of the organizations like the national black journalists, the national black Hispanics association, national black--or--
Speaker 1: It wasn't, certainly not NA- certainly not NABJ [National Association of Black Journalists], I don't believe.  I don't believe his- AHANA was a precursor to that.  It was one of the first workshops of its kind in the country.  And--
Speaker 2: And he saw the need because--?
Speaker 1: I think he didn't see any minorities at the University of Missouri School of Journalism.  And they got a grant, the way the history has been told to me, from I want to say the Missouri Broadcasters Association to--and other people--to hold this workshop every year.  But I think Dr. Knight looked the University of Missouri School of Journalism in the early '70s [1970s] and said, "Why don't we have more minority students here?  Maybe we can do something to encourage more minority students to go into journalism."
Speaker 2: And he himself was Hispanic?
Speaker 1: He was Hispanic, yes.
Speaker 2: And were there, I mean, I don't know, were there any Hispanic newspapers at the time in the--
Speaker 1: I, I'm--
Speaker 2: Did they have a number of--
Speaker 1: In St. Louis [Missouri], you mean?
Speaker 2: In St. Louis, yeah.
Speaker 1: I'm not aware of that.
Speaker 2: Okay.  No, it wouldn't--it was too early, yeah.
Speaker 1: I don't--at the time I don't think it was a very large Hispanic population in St. Louis.  And if there were, if there was, I didn't, I wasn't aware of it.
Speaker 2: So then once he started this, the minority journalism workshop, it grew and grew and grew.  And it--
Speaker 1: Every summer it's held, the University of Missouri for two weeks.  I try to go back whenever I can.  I've been back for the last, you know, twenty, twenty-five years or so as a guest instructor.  It's fun for me to go back and--
Speaker 2: Right.  And to teach.
Speaker 1: --and to teach and see the students, and to know that hey, this is where I got my start.  I consider that the place where I got my professional start, that workshop.
Story_ID: 500762
Speaker 1: What do you consider to be your first well-written piece on j- of journalism?
Speaker 2: Oh gosh, I'm still waiting for that.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: But I guess my first well-written piece of journalism was something that I was, where I felt (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well I'm hoping it came in high school.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Well, I was going there.  I was go- I was thinking of TV, but in terms of journalism, I want to say I was a high school student at Webster Groves High School [Webster Groves, Missouri].  And I had written this speech--I'd read a New York Times [The New York Times] article about South Africa and apartheid, and I wrote an editorial about it.  And I remember calling a guy named Greg Freeman at the St. Louis Post--or at the St. Louis American, who was a college student at the St. Louis American.  And I said, "You don't know me, but my name is Russell Mitchell [HistoryMaker Russ Mitchell].  I'm a student at Webster Groves High School, and I've written this editorial and I'd love to send it to you and have you look at it."  I sent it to him, and he published it.  And he said, "It was a really nice job."  And I think that was the first thing that I did that I felt really good about.  Greg (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What did you say?  Yeah.
Speaker 2: Greg went on, Greg went on to become editor at the S- and a columnist at the St. Louis Post-Dispatch.  Again, I was telling you about the--
Speaker 1: Nice, yeah.
Speaker 2: --black newspapers there being a launching ground for people.  And I, for me, in weird, sort of way--
Speaker 1: So are you still connected, the two of you?  Do you still stay in touch?
Speaker 2: Greg passed away a few years ago.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, we stayed in touch for years, and I owe a lot to him as well.  But in a, in a weird sort of way, that's kind of what gave me my encouragement as well, this guy (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What did you say in the editorial?  Can you remember about--
Speaker 2: I don't remember exactly.  I remember just saying how, how bad it was, and most people don't know how bad it is.  And I think I was a little more articulate than I'm being right now.  (Laughter) But I think I was just pointing out how bad the situation was there, and this is something that people need to be aware of and we needed to do something about.
Speaker 1: And you were how old when that was published?
Speaker 2: I must have been seventeen.
Speaker 1: Seventeen.
Speaker 2: And people of my generation certainly didn't know.  I think the American was catering (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And what was the name of the paper?
Speaker 2: The St. Louis American.
Speaker 1: St. Louis American?
Speaker 2: Yeah, not that, not that, you know, people of my generation were the target audience for the St. Louis American, but I remember writing it and sending it in.  It was also in the high school newspaper as well, after that.
Speaker 1: And what was the name of the high school newspaper?
Speaker 2: The St. Lou- the Webster Groves ECHO.
Speaker 1: The ECHO.
Speaker 2: The ECHO newspaper.  But that was really, I mean that was my first piece of journalism I wrote that I was really proud of, and that somebody told me, "Yeah, hey, this is pretty good."
Speaker 1: And so from there you thought, okay, I will pursue this further?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I thought, I thought I would pursue this as far (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Was that before the workshop [Urban Journalism Workshop; Missouri Urban Journalism Workshop]?
Speaker 2: I want to say that was after the workshop (simultaneous).
Story_ID: 500763
Speaker 1: Yeah, that [Mitchell's St. Louis American editorial] was after the workshop [Urban Journalism Workshop; Missouri Urban Journalism Workshop] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So you honed your skills during the workshop?
Speaker 1: Well, it was two weeks.  I think the workshop was more of something to get your feet wet; to get in there and see how something's done.  I had never been around television cameras before.  I'd never even been around, for that long of time, professionals in the business.  There was a guy from ABC who was one of the instructors there; Gerald Boyd [Gerald M. Boyd] was one of the instructors at this workshop; [HistoryMaker] George Curry was one of the instructors at the workshop; Max Heusler [ph.], who was a professor at the University of Missouri [Columbia, Missouri]; Dr. Robert Knight [Robert P. Knight], who I was telling you about; and Lincoln Harrison [ph.] from ABC; and Reva [ph.], I forget Reva's name.  Reva and Lincoln were married.  But Reva was a big, you know, newspaper reporter (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) She's still around.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Sheila Rule was there as well, who I believe was with the Post-Dispatch [St. Louis Post-Dispatch] at that time, and at the time was married to Gerald Boyd.  I mean you're talking about, you know, Mount Rushmore here of people there, you know, teaching you and telling you, "You're doing this right, you're doing this wrong.  But hey, you know, you can do this."  I mean that, I think the workshop was more to get your feet wet.  Was more to kind of let you get in there and see how things were done and meet people who hopefully would have an influence on your career someday.
Story_ID: 500764
Speaker 1: What high school did you graduate from?
Speaker 2: Webster Groves.
Speaker 1: Webster Groves (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Webster Groves High School--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --in Webster Groves, Missouri.
Speaker 1: And what year was that?
Speaker 2: Nineteen seventy-eight [1978].
Speaker 1: Nineteen seventy-eight [1978]?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And who was responsible for getting you into the University of--
Speaker 2: Missouri [University of Missouri, Columbia, Missouri]?
Speaker 1: --Missouri?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I don't, I don't think any--I applied and I got in.  I don't know if any really--
Speaker 1: Where else did you apply?
Speaker 2: I applied at Park College [Park University] in Kansas City [Parkville, Missouri], and I got a baseball scholarship to go to Park College.
Speaker 1: So you were a great baseball player?
Speaker 2: No, I wasn't a great baseball player (laughter) which is why I decided to turn it down because I knew I was never going to go anywhere as a baseball player.  But Park was a small school, had a baseball team that wanted to, wanted to, you know, make its mark in the world.  And I got a baseball scholarship to play third base.  But at that point I wasn't very good, and I knew I wasn't going to, you know, I really wasn't going to go far in baseball, so it was never a consideration.  University of Illinois [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Champaign-Urbana, Illinois], I applied there.  The University of Missouri-Kansas City [Kansas City, Missouri], I applied there.  Kansas University [University of Kansas, Lawrence, Kansas], I applied there (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So were you accepted to all of them?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I remember I was not accepted to the University of Kansas, I remember didn't get in there.  And it was a bone of contention for me because my best friend went there and we, you know, we duked it out for the longest time there.  But my first choice really was the University of Missouri.  (Laughter) And thank heavens I got in there.  So it worked out from that standpoint.
Speaker 1: So the summer between going to college and that summer you worked at the station [KTVI-TV, St. Louis, Missouri]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I worked at the station.  Actually I worked at the station--
Speaker 1: The entire year?
Speaker 2: --my entire senior year.
Speaker 1: Senior year.
Speaker 2: And, but yeah, that summer I worked at the station as the night switchboard operator.
Speaker 1: Were you ever promoted to something else?  Or you were only at night (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, I was the night switchboard operator the whole year.
Speaker 1: What did you see that--given that amount of time, what did you see that changed?
Speaker 2: Well, the change in terms of--?
Speaker 1: Just your perception of television.  What--
Speaker 2: You know what?
Speaker 1: The enlightenment, what en- yeah?
Speaker 2: You know what?  I got to know how the business operated.  I got a taste of the journalism standpoint and the journalism aspect of this and the workshop [Urban Journalism Workshop; Missouri Urban Journalism Workshop].  But being there on the switchboard for that year and being there and having access to the general manager, and to the news director, and the people in the newsroom, and the people in the sales department, the people in the programming department, the sales department, I got a real sense of how the business of television worked, which was really helpful.  And then on the weekends I'd go in the newsroom and volunteer to go out on stories and stuff like that, just to kind of hang out.
Speaker 1: Well--
Speaker 2: So yeah, I learned a lot.
Story_ID: 500765
Speaker 1: We were talking about just you getting into school.  So you were accepted into--
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: --accepted into the university.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: And freshman year. Freshman year--
Speaker 2: And this is 1980?
Speaker 1: Freshman year would have been '78 [1978], '79 [1979].
Speaker 2: Seventy-eight [1978].
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: You know, an eye-opening experience.  University of Missouri [Columbia, Missouri] had twenty-four thousand students at the time, five hundred black students.
Speaker 2: Wow, I didn't know that was so few black students.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, this was, this was--I don't know what it's like now, but that's what it was like then.  And you're not in the journalism school until you're--at that time you didn't go to the journalism school until you were a junior.  So, for the first two years you're in the arts and sciences (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well let me ask you this.  What did your father [Lowell Mitchell] think about you going to a school that he couldn't be admitted to?
Speaker 1: I think he was very proud of me.
Speaker 2: He was proud, okay.
Speaker 1: I don't think that ever came up, to be honest with you.  I mean I don't think--I mean honestly that's something I didn't even realize until I was in school for a few years and having this conversation with these students from the Middle East.  So I think he was very proud of that.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I don't think that was--if he did think something about that, he never shared with me.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So you go off to school.  Are you living on campus?
Speaker 1: Yep.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I lived in the Mark Twain dormitory [Mark Twain Hall], yes.  It was, yeah, it was fun.
Speaker 2: Now, were there any black organizations that you were a part of (background noise) at the time?
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: There were so few blacks on campus.  The summer before, my mother [Julia Hamilton Mitchell] and I had, my mother had taken me to--the summer before freshman year my mother took to campus for what was called Summer Welcome where they, you know, introduce the new freshmen and things like that.  And I can remember being introduced to the president of the Legion of Black Collegiates and asking him, "Wow, okay, so when I get here, how do I become a member of the Legion of Black Collegiates?"  He said, "Brother, there are five hundred black people here.  You walk in the door, you're already a member of the black collegiate."  (Laughter) So, so, I think my freshman year was spent, you know, as a member of the Legion of Black Collegiates, and you know, meeting the few folks we had in our dorm who were black students.  There were three--there were two other guys in my dormitory too, two other black guys who I became very close with (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Were they roommates?
Speaker 2: (Shakes head) They weren't--one of them became my roommate later.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Give me--
Speaker 2: But Demetrius Brigsby [ph.] and Calvin Walls [ph.], and these were two guys who we helped get each other through, you know, our freshman year.
Speaker 1: What was the--what were the challenges of getting through?
Speaker 2: Well, just being, I think just being in an environment where there were so few black people.  We had all had come from backgrounds where we were exposed to people of many races.  But being in that environment in Columbia, Missouri, which is a small town, dealing with the academic part of college life, dealing with the social part of college life (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Were there any black professors at the university?
Speaker 2: Yeah, there were bla- yeah, yeah, in fact, yeah.
Speaker 1: A sizeable number, small number?
Speaker 2: Probably a small number, but not a, not a, not a--probably a small number, but a very influential number.
Story_ID: 500766
Speaker 1: There was Dr. Daniel [Walter C. Daniel] who was a vi- also a vice president [sic. vice chancellor] of the university as well.  He was my African American liter- literature teacher.  He helped me get through that first year as well.  Again, this is a role model, somebody who's there, who's (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Tell me about him, Dr. Daniels [sic.].
Speaker 1: Dr. Daniels, he was--Dr. Daniel, he was the greatest guy.  He taught African American lit.  And a little background here.  The University of Missouri [Columbia, Missouri] at that time had a real problem with minority students.  Black folks were flunking out of there at an alarming rate.  One semester, and I know this because one of the curators, Marian Oldham, who was a civil rights activist for years, she was a curator at the University of Missouri, put out a paper where she said that the retention rate--what was it the--essentially the dropout rate for one semester at the University of Missouri among black students was 87 percent.  It was insane.  And what was happening is that the kids were coming up there, they weren't getting the guidance that they needed.  They were--racism was involved as well.  They weren't, you know, being told what classes to take, what classes not take, those kinds of things.  So when I enrolled at the University of Missouri, I enrolled for a fifteen hour load.  And again, I come from a family of educators, so they, you know, they guided me along.  But somehow the computer put me into a senior level African American lit course.  And I can remember walking into Dr. Daniel's class the first day.  And he went around the room introducing all of us.  And he said, "And Russ [HistoryMaker Russ Mitchell] is here.  You know, he's from St. Louis [Missouri].  And Russ is a brave soul, because freshmen normally don't take senior level courses.  But we're going to, we're going to whip Russ into shape."  And I can remember the first time Dr. Daniel called on me was about some book that I had kind of--I'd read, but I didn't really pay attention to.  He said (laughter), "What are your impressions of the book, Russ?"  And I told him my impressions.  And he said, "Russ, you remind me of the little boy who was supposed to go to Sunday school and didn't go.  When he got home his mother said, 'What did you talk about in Sunday school?'  And he said, 'We talked about Jesus.'"  (Laughter) I ran to the library and read that book again and again and again, just so that would never happen to me again.  But Dr. Daniel, throughout my freshman year and throughout the course of my college years, he was the guy I could go to.  And I wound up getting an A in his class.  And I wound up going to him, and confiding in, and getting advice from him and things like that.  There was Dr. Strickland [Arvarh E. Strickland], who also taught African American history who I had as well.  I mean these were guys who were pretty powerful at the university.  So, I say the professors, there was a small number of black professors.  But in the academic community there, I think they were pretty powerful.
Story_ID: 500767
Speaker 1: In the history, the political history of St. Louis [Missouri], or Missouri, have there been any African American mayors of St. Louis?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  St. Louis--I mean Columbia [Missouri] is 125 miles from--.  So, it's a different (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.  So, it's different, right.
Speaker 2: It's a small city.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: But St. Louis, yeah, has had two black mayors.
Speaker 1: But I'm just trying to think about it.  It seems so progressive, all the things you're telling me about St. Louis.
Speaker 2: Well, St. Louis, St. Louis has had two--
Speaker 1: And even Columbia, I mean--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --these--
Speaker 2: Well, these professors, you know, were there.  I mean Columbia at the time, progressive is not the word I would use to describe it.
Speaker 1: No, I mean but just--you talk about them, and I mean they seem so powerful to--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, I mean I guess you're right.  I mean they were, yeah, they were pretty powerful guys.  I mean St. Louis has had two black mayors in the last twenty years, Mayor Bosley [HistoryMaker Freeman Bosley, Jr.] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And the first was in what, 19- ?
Speaker 2: Oh god, I want to say the '80s [1980s], the late '80s [sic. 1982].
Speaker 1: In the '80s [1980s], okay.
Speaker 2: The late '80s [1980s] or early '90s [1990s].  Freeman Bosley was followed by Clarence Harmon who was the police chief before that.
Speaker 1: And what about presidents of the University of Missouri [Columbia, Missouri]?
Speaker 2: In fact I think, I think the president of the university, the University of Missouri now is African American [Elson Floyd].
Speaker 1: But for the first time?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, so that--
Speaker 2: It's got to be for the first time.
Speaker 1: Who was the president when you were there?
Speaker 2: Barbara Uehling [Barbara S. Uehling] was the chancellor.
Speaker 1: Oh, it was a woman.
Speaker 2: It was a woman, yeah, Barbara Uehling was the chancellor.  But you know, when I say that, you know, that my two buddies and I, we helped, you know, get everybody through that, I mean coming to a campus like that, even though you're from a background where you've experienced, you know, things from many different races, the University of Missouri at that time was a place where it was very segregated.  I mean the black folks did this--not in terms of where you lived or anything like that.  But socially, there was Greek town, you know, which was all the white Greek organizations who had these, you know, big home- big houses.  And every Friday night you'd walk through and there was a party.  And then you know the black Greeks would have a party at the student union, which would be much smaller, but that was our, that was where we would go.
Speaker 1: Did you pledge?
Speaker 2: But I remember that.  I pledged.  I was, I was on the Kappa [Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity] line for three weeks, and you know what?  It was stay in the Kappa line or flunk out of school.  And I chose to--it was stay in the Kappa line and flunk out of school (laughter) or stay in school.  And I decided to stay in school.  The chapter at that time was going through some problems.  Later on that particular chapter I believe was disbanded for a while.  But you know I'm sorry that happened because it was a great organization, still is, and there were some really good people there at the time.  But I had to make a decision at that point.
Story_ID: 500768
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So, if there are only five hundred African American students at the university.  How many were in the journalism school?
Speaker 2: Not many at all.  When I was, when--by the time I got into journalism school I think there were seven of us.  And in the journalism school I don't know the, let's say there were five thousand people in journalism school.  There may have been, in the broadcasting sequence, there may have been seven of us; not many at all.
Speaker 1: And let's--what sorts of things do they teach an African American broadcast journalist?  I mean are they working with you on your diction?  Are they saying, oh, you can't sound black; are they, I mean does any of that stuff ever come up?
Speaker 2: You know, I never had that, I don't know.  I can tell you as somebody who has taught in workshops and things like that I've taken people aside quite frankly.
Speaker 1: You have?
Speaker 2: And I've asked that, you know, privately, "Hey, let me just tell you something.  You know, this is what they're looking for in terms of speaking English.  Slang is great, you know, if you're out with your buddies, but it's not going to work on television and it's not going to work on the radio.  It's not going to work in the workplace."  I've taken people aside and have done that.  I never (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Are pe- people are offended by it, I'm sure.
Speaker 2: You know what?  I, I, I've seen people call people out in public like that.  And yeah, I think that's, that's a different story.  But I know I've done it, I've taken people aside.  It never happened at the university to anybody that I know of, to anybody that I know of.
Speaker 1: Well, how did they prepare you?  I mean how did you prepare you for the real workplace at the university?  I mean at the time there were not a lot of black broadcasters.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  But they, they didn't prepare me or anybody there, as far as any black students there as to what it's going to be like for you as a black reporter, or a black person out there; that wasn't part of the curriculum there.  They prepared you to be a reporter, or to be a producer, or to be whatever it is you want to be.
Speaker 1: And talk to me about the preparations for being a reporter.
Speaker 2: Well, you--
Speaker 1: You learn things like?
Speaker 2: You would go out in the, be on the radio station.  You'd go out and you'd do stories.  You would have a semester where you worked on the newspaper, where they would send you out.  In the newsroom they'd send you out and do stories.  And you'd come back, and you know, they'd critique your stories.  There were (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Did you feel that you were--within the school, I'm talking about--as a black journalist, that you are assumed to cover black stories?  Or could you cover any story?
Speaker 2: That didn't happen in Columbia, Missouri.  Now, there have been stops along my career where I--that has happened.  But in terms of the University of Missouri [Columbia, Missouri], that didn't happen.  I mean Columbia, Missouri--I think by the time you got to journalism school there was never, nothing like, "We'll--go send Russ [HistoryMaker Russ Mitchell] out to do this," or Michael [ph.], who was another black student there at the time to go out and do that.  I didn't feel that way at the University of Missouri.
Speaker 1: So by the time you get to that school, you were seeing all of that--
Speaker 2: Well, that in particular, what we're talking about there, I didn't feel any of that.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, you didn't feel any of that.
Speaker 2: I didn't feel as though they were like sending me out to do, you know--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --strictly black stories.  However, I will say there have been stops along my career where I have had that.
Speaker 1: And we'll talk about that.
Speaker 2: And we'll talk about that later.  But I have had to say to people, "Hey, look, you know, that's not, you know, it's not why I'm here."
Speaker 1: Right.  So did you feel any sense of difference between black and white at the School of Journalism in Missouri?
Speaker 2: I mean only from the sense that there weren't many folks like me there.  But it wa- it's a pretty competitive place.  And by the time you get to the television station, it's very competitive.
Story_ID: 500769
Speaker 1: And what--
Speaker 2: You're (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) did Dr. Daniel [Walter C. Daniel] have to say about--
Speaker 2: Stick with it.
Speaker 1: Stick with it.
Speaker 2: Just stick your head u- keep your head up and just keep going, you're going to meet thousands of people--
Speaker 1: Who were your other mentors at the time?
Speaker 2: Probably Dr. Knight, Dr. Robert Knight [Robert P. Knight]--
Speaker 1: Dr. Knight.
Speaker 2: --who I, you know, I told you about.
Speaker 1: What about people within journalism itself, broadcast journalism?
Speaker 2: I don't think there was anybody that I would pick up the phone and call and say, "You know, hey, what should I do?  How about this?"  (Unclear)--
Speaker 1: Had you seen Ed Bradley on TV by this time?
Speaker 2: Oh, sure.  Yeah, I mean, of course.  He had been my inspiration for a while.  But in terms of somebody I could pick up the phone and say, "Hey, you know, what do I do now?" I didn't have access to folks like that at that particular time.  But of course, I mean Julius Hunter was an inspiration at that time.  Julius Hunter wound up getting an award from the University of Missouri [Columbia, Missouri], and I was one of his guides, which thrilled me, thrilled me immensely (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What year was he, did he work?
Speaker 2: He worked, gosh, he worked in St. Louis television [St. Louis, Missouri] I want to say from 1974 to 2004.
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, he worked there a long time.  So yeah, I mean these people were inspirations, and people that I knew that, you know, who had done really well, and I wanted to somehow in their footsteps.  But in terms of having somebody I could pick up the phone and call from, you know, of that ilk, there was nobody.  We had friends to.  Yeah, there were two guys, Michael [ph.] and Steven Hill [ph.], who were twins who were black students there.  We you know, we kind of, you know, took care of each other, and you know, made sure that everybody was doing their work and that kind of thing.
Speaker 1: But did you ever talk about with each other what the prospects were outside of school?
Speaker 2: Yeah, in terms of--
Speaker 1: And what were they?
Speaker 2: --in terms of getting a job, we didn't know.
Speaker 1: You didn't know.
Speaker 2: You didn't know at that time, but I mean--what's the market?  And I don't anybody knows when you're coming in.
Speaker 1: Even today you don't know?
Speaker 2: Even today, I don't think you know.  What is the market like for a black reporter?  Wow, is anybody going to want a black reporter?  And unfortunately this business is a business that looks at people that way.  I tell people it is the most racist, sexist, business there is that makes no apologies for it.  Because people are looking for black reporters, or they're looking for a white female, or they're looking for a white male.  I mean that's just kind of the way this business operates.  It's, it's, it's, it's, just kind of the way it is.  So when you graduate from college, you sit and you wonder, now, I wonder if there's a market out there for a black reporter?
Speaker 1: Okay.  But you, having said that, then you would have to assume that then it crosses, you know, the line to saying, "Okay, then we're looking for a black female anchor."  Or, "No, we- we've got to have a white female anchor."  Or, does that--does--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, it definitely happens.
Speaker 1: --it go all the way up?
Speaker 2: I think it goes all the way up.  I mean I think certainly in local TV, it certainly, you know, goes that way.  I don't think it's something that people talk about.  I don't think that in the middle of the newsroom that--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --somebody's going to come out and say, "Hey, I'm looking for--."  But no, I definitely think it's that way.
Speaker 1: You think there's someone sitting someplace saying, "Oh, we can't have three African Americans," like, you know.
Speaker 2: I think it's a question of mix.
Speaker 1: Of mix.
Speaker 2: I think if you, I think if you're a news director or if you're a general manager, you're looking for a staff that represents the community.
Speaker 1: You're looking for staff that represents the community.
Speaker 2: You're looking for--you know, but I do think, I know, that's kind of the way the business is and always has been.  It's, it's like Hollywood in the sense that in most cases, in many cases--not in most cases, but in many cases they're looking for a type.  And many times they're looking for a type, and, you know?
Speaker 1: So, it's like casting a movie, right?
Speaker 2: In some respects it is.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: In some respects it is.  I guess I think it's--and I say this, you know, as a--someone who's been in this business for twenty-five years.  It is the most racist, sexist business there is that makes no apologies for it.  Most businesses say yes, you're right, we should get better.  And this business says as well, we should get better.  But in terms of practices and hiring people on television, a lot of times that comes into play.
Speaker 1: How did you graduate?  Top of the class?  Middle of the class?
Speaker 2: I don't think we did--I don't remember there being any, you know, any hierarchy there--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --in journalism school.
Speaker 1: What year did you--?
Speaker 2: Nineteen eighty-two [1982].
Story_ID: 500770
Speaker 1: And what do you consider to be your first professional job?
Speaker 2: KMBC-TV in Kansas City [Missouri].  Two weeks after I graduated [from the University of Missouri, Columbia, Missouri] I started.  I was the reporter trainee, which meant that I got to do everything the other reporters did, except get paid like them (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Well, let's talk about that then, do you think they were looking for a black reporter?
Speaker 2: Well, it's interesting about that particular job.  The guy who had the job before I had it, the trainee job, was a white guy.  When I got the job, the title--he was a white guy who was a great guy, but he did a terrible job.  When I got the job, somehow the title changed to minority training.  So, you know, I, I, I, I have always gone back and forth wondering, hm, why is it suddenly minority training, when the white guy who had it before didn't do a good job?
Speaker 1: Was a reporter.
Speaker 2: And he was a reporter, and got like, you know?  So, I, I don't know, I don't know what their thinking was at that point.  And I was there for six months, but I--
Speaker 1: Only for six months?
Speaker 2: Only six months.  Then I got a job in Dallas [at WFAA-TV, Dallas, Texas].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Let's talk about those six months, though.  What did you learn?
Speaker 2: I learned a lot about pacing yourself; about--
Speaker 1: What's pacing yourself?
Speaker 2: As the low guy on the totem pole, anywhere, especially in TV, you're the guy who's going to get sent out to do everything.  I remember that one day was Labor Day, and I'd been doing this for two months.  They sent me out to do four stories in one day.  Now, the regular reporters did one.  I was sent out to do four, four packages, four like--you know, put it all together and put it on TV.  One for the five [o'clock], one for the six, one for the ten, and for, I don't know where the fourth one went (laughter).  But you know, "Yeah, I'll do it, I'll go do it."  Well, I remember the third one I made a major mistake.  There was a guy running for [U.S.] Congress, and I called him a senatorial candidate; major mistake.  I got called into the news director's office the next day.  Just kind of looked at me and he went (gesture).  He called me in, and I said, "I have no excuse.  It was a busy day yesterday, they sent me on four stories."  He goes, "That's no excuse."  I go, "You're exactly right, I'm not using it as one."  So I learned that you have to pace yourself because nobody's going to take care of you.  You have to really look out for yourself.  I also, I was making eleven thousand dollars, seven hundred dollars a year--eleven seven [$11,700].  And I had these shoes that I had bought when I first got the job.  And I said, I'm not going to get any new shoes.  I'm going to keep these on and they're going to get ratty, but my bosses are going to look at them and they're going to say, wow, his shoes are really messed up.  He needs a raise.  So about three months into this, my shoes were pretty ratty.  And I was out on a story, in fact it was a story on Bill Blass, a designer who came to town.  So a photographer from the other station looked at my shoes, he goes "Man, what is--you're going to meet Bill Blass today, you can't wear those shoes."  I said, "These are my I want to get a raise shoes."  I told them the story, "They're going to look at these and they're going to say, 'He needs a raise.'"  He goes, "I got to tell you something, man: they don't care."  (Laughter) So, I'm wearing the--yeah, not only do they not care, I mean you have to take care of yourself, I mean in so many different ways there, because nobody is going to look out for you.  You can have a rabbi, you can have somebody who likes you.  But at the end of the day, you've got to take care of yourself.
Speaker 1: Well that's a good lesson learned.  So you learned that in the six months that you were there (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) (Laughter) In the six months I was there.
Story_ID: 500771
Speaker 1: Why did you move on?
Speaker 2: I got a job offer in Dallas [at WFAA-TV, Dallas, Texas], which is the eighth largest market in the country.  One of those things where a news director at the station [KTVI-TV] in St. Louis [Missouri] where I'd interned in the summertime was best friends with a news director in Dallas [Texas].  They were looking for a cheap reporter, I'm sure.  I'm sure that my race came into play as well.  And they offered me a job.  And it wasn't a reporter trainee job, it was a full reporter's job.  It was for a full twenty thousand dollars, you know, in Dallas.  And that was the eighth largest market in the country, and I thought I had died and gone to heaven, until I got there and I realized I was really out of my league.  It was, it was a powerhouse station, and I wasn't ready for it.
Speaker 1: Was it a CBS station?
Speaker 2: It was an ABC--
Speaker 1: ABC.
Speaker 2: --station.  The station [KMBC-TV] in Kansas City [Missouri] was an ABC station as well.  But you know, with affiliates usually it doesn't make a difference--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --unless you're talking about owned and operated stations, and we weren't talking about those there.  But, it was an eye opener.  I was six months out of school [University of Missouri, Columbia, Missouri] at a station, a powerhouse station in the eighth largest market in the country.  And it took me a while to get my--
Speaker 1: What's a while?
Speaker 2: --get my legs.  Six months to a year to get my legs; to feel comfortable there.  I mean you had re- people who had been there, who had been at the network who came back to local TV to work there.  Those were the kind of folks that I was working with there.
Speaker 1: And what year are we talking about?
Speaker 2: We're talking about--I left, I started there in '83 [1983], in January of '83 [1983] in Dallas.
Speaker 1: So Reagan's [President Ronald Wilson Reagan] the president.
Speaker 2: Reagan's the president.
Speaker 1: And what was happening within the country?  What stories were you covering?  Were you covering national stories or local?
Speaker 2: No, no, no, no; local stories.
Speaker 1: Local.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, local stories.
Speaker 1: Well, tell me some of the local stories.
Speaker 2: In Dallas or in Kansas City?
Speaker 1: In Dallas.
Speaker 2: In Dallas?
Speaker 1: When--at this powerhouse station.
Speaker 2: Yeah, in Dallas I'm covering fires; I'm covering local races; I'm covering the education beat.  My first story there was about a murder, about a guy who, I mean I'll never forget this guy whose wife chopped his head off.
Speaker 1: Oh (gasps).
Speaker 2: You know, I mean those kind of local stories I'm covering.  Yeah, I mean it was pretty much, I was a general assignment reporter.  And again, I was low man on the totem pole.  So it, you know, you're pretty much sent out to do everything.
Speaker 1: So was that a morning show, or were you on go-
Speaker 2: No, I was a general assignment reporter.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I was working--in fact I think to indoctrinate me, they threw me into the night shift, which is like a SWAT [Special Weapons and Tactics] team.  Like you come in, and they send you right out on a story, and you're doing live shots and things like that.  And again, it took me six months to a year to get my sea legs there, because it was a powerhouse station, and I'm twenty-two, twenty-three years old there.
Speaker 1: Were you the only African American on?
Speaker 2: No, no, there was another guy.
Speaker 1: Who were the others?
Speaker 2: There was another guy there named Gary Reaves who was a reporter.
Speaker 1: And what did he do?
Speaker 2: He was a reporter.  In fact, he came to the network later and went back there.  Gary's perhaps the best reporter I've ever worked with.
Speaker 1: What makes him the best?
Speaker 2: He's just a solid reporter.  He knows how to get his facts.  He, he, he's great on the air.
Speaker 1: How do you, what are the secrets you tell people about getting their place?
Speaker 2: You know, there are some people in this business who I look at--I look at Gary Reaves.  I'm talking about people I've worked with.  Gary Reaves; there was Scott Pelley who is here at CBS.  And I watched them work the phones, and it's magical to see them on the phone working sources.  And I wish I could do that as well as they do.  But Gary did that, you know; no one did that better than Gary.  [HistoryMaker] Iola Johnson was the main anchor there, black wo- black woman.  Paula Walker, who's now [HistoryMaker] Paula Madison, who is now the general manager at KNBC [KNBC-TV] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Of NBC.  Yeah.
Speaker 2: --in Los Angeles [California].
Speaker 1: But Paula Madison's also doing something with Telemundo, wasn't she?
Speaker 2: Is she really?  It doesn't, I (unclear).  But Paula was the public affairs director there at the station.  Paula and I have an interesting history because I had met her years before because her first husband was married to the uncle of my best friend [sic.].
Story_ID: 500772
Speaker 1: I remember Paula [HistoryMaker Paula Madison] was teaching at Syracuse University [Syracuse, New York], and my best friend said (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Journalism?
Speaker 1: Journalism.  And my best friend said, "This is my buddy, Russ [HistoryMaker Russ Mitchell], and he wants to go into TV."  She said, "Don't go into TV, don't do it (gesture)."  So when I walked into WFAA [WFAA-TV, Dallas, Texas], and I said, "Paula, you're the one who told me not to go into TV."  And of course, the rest for Paula is history.  I mean she's news director here in New York [New York], big honcho in L.A. [Los Angeles, California].  So, Paula was there.  There were a number of other people in the sales department.  There was, well, I mean there was a pretty good support system there.  So that wasn't an issue.  But I mean you know you're twenty-two, twenty-three years old walking into a powerhouse station like that, it can be intimidating.  But when you're that--when I first walked in there, I was too dumb to know (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And the challenges are that you're not good with sources, or that you don't know who to--what are the challenges?
Speaker 1: Well, I think in this business there are some people who are just naturals, who, you know, the first time they do it you can look at them and you can say, wow, this person gets it.  And they have that intangible (air quotes) it about them.  For most of us, you learn by doing.  And if you haven't been doing it a long time, you may not know how to do that smooth, live shot.  You may not be the best writer.  You may not be the best at honing sources.  You may not be the best at managing your time.  You may be really eager to do whatever they tell you to do, and then you, you know, you're prone to make mistakes.  So, in my case, and in the case of many people that I see who get into a situation like that, you just, you're just not quite ready for it.  You haven't had the experience; you haven't been thrown into a situation where you really have to come to play in an environment like that (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) But you stayed--I'm sorry, go ahead.
Speaker 1: I was there for two years.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: But within that time you were moved up to 'Daybreak' ['News 8 Daybreak'].  Were you anchor there?
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean I got better.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I got better.
Speaker 2: And quickly, but--
Speaker 1: I got better.  I mean in that kind of environment it's a sink or swim thing.  And they renewed my contract after the first year, and then they made me anchor over the morning show, of 'Daybreak.'
Story_ID: 500773
Speaker 1: And I was covering education as well (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And what's the difference in anchoring and reporting?
Speaker 1: I think that whenever a kid comes to me now and says, "I want to be an anchor," I say, "Well, you need to be a reporter first."  Because being a reporter makes you a better anchor because you know how things are done.  The difference being an anchor is you are there, I mean you are in charge.  You're sitting there on that set, you're the traffic cop.  You're the one--
Speaker 2: So, is an anchor sort of like an editor is to a newspaper?
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: (TAPE INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 1: Go ahead.
Speaker 2: In my mind, an anchor is the last gatekeeper.  If something comes across, you know, my desk--if I see something, if I'm anchoring and I don't, and it doesn't work, or I think there's something wrong with it--
Speaker 1: You're--have the final say.
Speaker 2: You're the final, I mean you're, you're the last gatekeeper.  I mean sometimes it's contractually written out.  For instance, Katie Couric and Dan Rather before her have a title called managing editor.  So it's a contractual issue with them.  But in terms of a practical matter, if I'm the one saying it, you know, and I'm the last person--I'm the person that person that people are going to hear it from.  And if I see something that I don't think is correct, of course I'm going to discuss with, you know, folks that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well does that hold true for, say, a live broadcast, a breaking news story, and the anchor is getting information from all over?
Speaker 2: (Unclear).
Speaker 1: It's your job to--
Speaker 2: Especially in a breaking news situation because you're filtering information.  I mean someone can tell you in your ear that So and So's been shot.  You want to make sure that that's happened.  So you may for the moment hold back on that.  Or you may even say on the air, as I've heard people say, "I'm getting something in my ear that I don't want to report yet.  I just want to make sure we've checked that out.  Please tell me if that is true."  You're the last gatekeeper.  And the truth of the matter is that when something goes wrong, you know, you're likely to--
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: (TAPE INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 1: I think as an anchor, yeah, you're the last gatekeeper.  You--and a breaking news story especially, you're the person who's filtering information to the public.  I think it's, that's why it's so important to be a reporter, and a good reporter I think before you make that jump to being an anchor.
Speaker 2: Is it important then to have written the way you did f- in the news- in a newspaper style to be a good newspaper reporter, to be a good television reporter?
Speaker 1: I don't think so.
Speaker 2: No, you don't think so.  Okay.
Speaker 1: I think they're two different styles in terms of, again, the actual getting down and doing it style.  I mean being a good newspaper reporter will certainly help you with other skills; with you know getting sources and developing contacts and knowing how to work the phones.  But in terms of being on the air, I'm not sure that that skill necessary would come into play.
Speaker 2: I read something where, I can't remember who said it, but some newscaster would say--he'd finish the show, and he'd always wanted to say, now, go read the paper.
Speaker 1: It was Walter Cronkite.  Walter Cronkite said that he would, he always wanted to say to people at the end of evening news, and not, "And that's the way it is," but, now go and read your local newspaper.  Because there's only so much that a newscast can give people.  I mean I tell people all the time, don't get all your news from television.  I mean please you know read a newspaper, at least one newspaper a day.  I mean watch us, of course.  (Laughter) We want you to do that.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: But we also want you to--you have to read the newspaper to get some depth.

Speaker 1: For 'Daybreak' ['News 8 Daybreak'] were you the first African American male anchor the show had had?
Speaker 2: I don't know.  I replaced a guy who had been there for a long time, you know (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) But the guy wasn't black that you replaced?
Speaker 2: No, he was definitely not bla- no.  But I don't, I don't remember if I was or not honestly.
Speaker 1: I mean this is the '80s [1980s] I mean there couldn't have been that many--
Speaker 2: I could have been.  I could have been, I just don't know.
Speaker 1: Was that your first time anchoring any show?
Speaker 2: I anchored in college [University of Missouri, Columbia, Missouri].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Badly but I had anchored (laughter) in college.
Speaker 1: But it was the first professional opportunity?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was my first professional opportunity to anchor, yeah.  It was a morning show that came on at 6:15, and I guess we ended at 7.  It was weird, it was forty-five minute show.  But yeah, that was my first opportunity to anchor (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And as an anchor then you have an opportunity--was it the type of morning show that we see today that you're doing?  Like you can interview, I don't know, oh you know some--the president and then you do a cooking segment and then you have a--
Speaker 2: Yeah, you know what?  In that respect it (unclear)--
Speaker 1: --funny guy on?
Speaker 2: I mean in that respect, it was pretty primitive.  It was pretty much a straight news show, and what I recall about the interviews, they were pretty hard hitting interviews of local law- local newsmakers.  We're talking about 1984 before here.  I mean the morning show has evolved, the local morning show especially has evolved from that point.  But what I recall about it, it was pretty, it was more like a headline news service you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, we have one minute left on this tape.
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: But I want you--to close out today, I want you to give me a moment from that particular time as the anchor of 'Daybreak' that still sticks with you; that stands out.
Speaker 2: There was a tornado one day in Dallas [Texas].  And I remember that there was no script.  There was very little information.  They told me, "You have to talk for five minutes and tell people about this tornado, and what happened, before you go to the weather guy," who, for whatever reason was not available at that time.  And it was the first time that I was in that situation.  Dan Rather calls it juggling hot lead.  And I did it, and I did okay.  And I remember thinking for the first time professionally as an anchor, wow, you know this is something that I'd like to continue doing.  I'd like t- I want to keep reporting and all of that, but this is something that I can probably do.  And that was a really big moment for me.
