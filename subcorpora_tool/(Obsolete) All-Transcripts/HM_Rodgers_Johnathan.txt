Story_ID: 237545
Speaker 1: Now the next couple of questions are just some People magazine-ish type questions just to help us get to know you a little bit better and help us both get you know familiar with the process, so if you would please share with us your favorite food?
Speaker 2: Oh, my favorite food I think is peach cobbler, and something that I call black spaghetti.  Now spaghetti you know you boil the pasta and you put it on and you put the sauce on there, but there exists in the African American community spaghetti that you bake.  Put the pasta and the meat and you stick it in the oven that's my favorite dish.
Speaker 1: And your favorite time of year?
Speaker 2: Favorite time of year is the spring, even though I have hay fever and it drives me crazy it's just such a fresh, reawakening time and I just love the smells and the sights and I love the way that sort of we're coming out the winter and we're reborn.
Speaker 1: And your favorite color?
Speaker 2: Favorite color I think is blue.
Speaker 1: Your favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: That's interesting because I've been so many places that it's not a destination that's my favorite vacation, my favorite vacation is time I spend with my family somewhere, and so in fact our favorite family vacation is when the family went to Kenya and we went on a photographic safari, my wife [Royal Kennedy], my son [David Rodgers] and my daughter [Jamie Rodgers] and myself and that was truly wonderful.
Speaker 1: And your favorite phrase or saying, do you have one?
Speaker 2: You know I think it sort of changes from day to day, but being in the television industry, it's Andy Warhol's remark that everybody has their fifteen minutes of fame.  I've met a million people who I've given fifteen minutes to and now they're gone.
Story_ID: 237546
Speaker 1: Now let's begin by talking just a little bit about your background, starting with your mother.  Would you please share with us your mother's name, where your mother was born and where she grew up, and spent her time as a child--and that kind of thing?
Speaker 2: Yeah, my mother's name was Ethel Barbara Merriwether, and she was born in Lubbock, Texas in 1922, and she was one of about nine children and just truly a wonderful human being.  Her father died early in her life and she was raised mostly by her mom [Annie J. Merriwether] and in the tradition of a lot of African American families, a lot of them left Texas and moved to California and their mother came with them and their mother became our "big mama," so, you know, all the families had a big mama so my mother's mother was our big mama and my mother was just truly a wonderful individual.  Real smart, real kind, real gentle; education was crucially important to her and her family and it meant so much to her that given the time she was not able to go to college and graduate right after high school, but she went to San Francisco State College [San Francisco State University, San Francisco, California] in the 1950s and graduated and made us all real proud.
Speaker 1: And did she ever share any stories with you about what life was like for her as a little girl and things that she enjoyed doing at as a child?
Speaker 2: Not really because she, like my father [Marion Rodgers] and given the times, they mostly worked.  I mean it was the family go out and pick cotton, or the family would go out and, and shell peas, so it was sort of the work ethic and a survival ethic in that they're in a situation, they're in Texas where they were discriminated against, mistreated, but knew they were of greater value so clearly my mother's message from her parents was to do as well as you can and, and help fix this system, and so from her I really got this sort of work ethic to, not that one should have to, but she really wanted us to show the world what we were capable of doing.
Speaker 1: And did she ever talk about how the, the move from Texas to California, like what led up to that and how they prepared for that, that kind of thing?
Speaker 2: Well, yes and when we talk about my father it will sort of fall into place because my father saw as his opportunity for equality was to join the [U.S.] military, so moving to California for us was part of a military move.
Story_ID: 237547
Speaker 1: Did she [Rodgers' mother, Barbara Merriwether Rodgers] ever share any stories with you about growing up in such a big family and what family times were like and special occasions that kind of thing?
Speaker 2: Well you know it was almost less the stories that the shared, but the more the experiences that we had. When I was born in Texas I probably spent about the first five years of my life living there in the same town with my mother's mother [Annie J. Merriwether], and so I observed for myself what their family life was like and it was great just sort of seeing the sisters and brothers being together all the time and exchanging just sort of this love and these warm feelings but I remember most was you know sitting in the living room with that big radio and they'd be listening to their stories and they'd be, you know, doing the, snapping the green beans or whatever else.  It was this real sense of family but the family was huge, and so it really didn't become tense as some of our modern families become.  There were enough people that you could be with that you liked and just everybody seemed to get along.  Interestingly enough in her family it was their youngest child who became the most successful, and my mother's--passed away.  She died of breast cancer, but her older sister here in 2004 is about to celebrate her ninetieth birthday in a couple of weeks and her younger brother who is now sixty-five is one of the wealthiest African Americans in the Northwest, so it's a family that has longevity, it's a family that's done well and it's a family I'm really proud to be part of.
Speaker 1: And how did he obtain his wealth?
Speaker 2: He became an architect, he built buildings in Seattle [Washington], he built nursing homes and he became, you know we all like to think that we have this rich uncle and I know for you know for a lot of us--who's the rich uncle?  He's the guy who gives you five dollars at Christmas.  Well my rich uncle gave us all stock, you know, (laughter) and he stopped working when he was forty and spends a lot of his time doing bridge, playing bridge around the world.  So, it's just great that we have these sort of relationships and this sort of diversity in this one family, but what this one family was able to do is overcome a lot of the obstacles they'd have to become successful and not only successful unto themselves but to pass those messages on to their offspring.
Story_ID: 237548
Speaker 1: I know you said you stayed in Texas until you were about five, but one of the things I want to ask you about is do you remember Juneteenth celebrations when you were in Texas?
Speaker 2: No, I don't and interestingly enough I remember Juneteenth after leaving Texas, but because when you look at Juneteenth and at least we're in California or Chicago [Illinois] and celebrate Juneteenth essentially what we're doing we're creating this picnic or this event, we had that every weekend in Texas.  I mean you know talking about red soda water, talking about watermelon, that, that's a daily staple in Texas.  So Juneteenth was simply another day to have what you normally have, which was fine.
Story_ID: 237549
Speaker 1: Let's talk a little bit about your father now, starting with his name and where he was born and where he grew up as a child?
Speaker 2: Yes, my father's name was Marion Alfred Rodgers and he was born in a very small town called Elmo, Texas.
Speaker 1: Could you spell that?
Speaker 2: E-L-M-O.
Speaker 1: Thank you.
Speaker 2: And his father [Marion Rodgers] and mother--they were farmers, his father was I'd say three-fourths Native American and his name was Marion as well and my grandmother on my father's side her name was Sophie [Rodgers] and she was all the way African American, and it made for an interesting life because he grew up without electricity.  He was the youngest sibling in his very large family.  They did pick cotton in order to get wealth in the family.  I do remember even being, as late in my life, as being a teenager visiting my father's parents where they still didn't have electricity, where there still was the outhouse, where they did still plow their fields with a mule, and it was my father growing up in that situation, as again the youngest child of what I believe were, were like ten siblings who had the foresight to say, you know I think I'm pretty smart and I think I know what to do.  What is there in this country I can do to prove my value and not be as second class citizen, and this was right around the time [President Harry S.] Truman had already integrated the [U.S.] military.  Then my father said this looks like a place where I can get a fair shot, and so he joined the [U.S.] Air Force and he worked his way up.  He joined the Air Force as an enlisted person without a college education.  While in the Air Force got a college degree, got a master's degree and became an Officer and by the time he retired he was a lieutenant colonel in the Air Force, and he had seen the world, he had shown his family the world and it was just good for all us because he was able to maintain a high level of self-esteem because he was rewarded on merit.
Speaker 1: And probably one of very few African American Officers in the Air Force at that time?
Speaker 2: Well interestingly enough he was not a pilot he was more of an administrator and executive like I am, but he was part of the group of the Tuskegee Airmen and my father-in-law, [Lieutenant] James Kennedy was also a Tuskegee Airman.  So the fact is my children's [David Rodgers and Jamie Rodgers] grandparents on both my side and my wife's [Royal Kennedy] side are the grandchildren of Tuskegee Airmen and that means a lot to us.  So yes there were few, but those that they were they knew each other and they grew up with each other and they worked together and they played together and they flew together, so no, that was a very important part of our life was being part of the military establishment as we grew up.
Story_ID: 237550
Speaker 1: Did your father [Marion Rodgers] ever share any stories with you about some of the Tuskegee Airmen and their missions and that kind of thing?
Speaker 2: Well not really you know, interestingly enough most [U.S.] military people don't like to talk about war and violence and I respect them for that, however every year when there was a Tuskegee Airmen [Inc. (TAI)] Convention we, we'd get back into it.  We'd find out about it and I truly remember one of the most memorable moments for me in my life was at my father's funeral when the Tuskegee Airmen walked in, marched in and put the flag over my father's coffin.  I mean I broke down and had to cry because I knew what it meant to my father, what the military had meant to my father and what in turn it had meant to us because I wouldn't be here today if my father had not gone in the military.  Now he was smart enough to then become a principal or a teacher or an insurance salesmen, but it wasn't that.  It was taking us around the world, introducing us to all these new cultures.  Presenting to us a meritocracy, where people got promoted based on what they did and those are values I have until this day.  You can get anywhere you want to be, you just have to earn it.
Speaker 1: Did your father ever talk about what Texas was like when he was a young boy and just what daily life was like for him and that kind of thing?
Speaker 2: Yeah you know, but at that stage he would tell us stories about, "Yeah when I was your age I walked barefoot three miles to school," he was telling truth, you know but it was such a cliche we didn't want to hear it.  We just didn't want to hear it, but yes he did all those things and he tried to tell us, but we were just, me and my two brothers [Alford Rodgers and Glenn Rodgers] were just too hardheaded to listen, and we sort of didn't want to hear it 'cause the times were different.  More significant to us or significant to me would be the times in Texas where my father, a military officer couldn't get served at a restaurant, where he would be demeaned at a gas station just trying to buy a sandwich.  That hurt me because I knew it hurt him, but his generation they didn't want to talk it about it that way, they didn't want to talk about that pain, but I still feel that pain to this day and I know he felt it more than I did, but he had to carry it, he had to carry it with dignity and, and he had to be a person.  Now sometimes they would overreact and, and it would be the old cliches, "Don't act like a blank," you know, but that's what he was facing and it was all these sort of different messages coming in, but his message was to us, you know, "You may have to work harder, you may have to do more, but you need it in order to level the playing field".
Speaker 1: And how did your parents meet?
Speaker 2: You know, I don't know.  You know I, I see old pictures of them and they were both very, very attractive young people, but I don't know how they met.
Speaker 1: And did your father go to school in Elmo, Texas or did the family ever move from Elmo?
Speaker 2: No in fact, until my grandparents [Sophie Rodgers and Marion Rodgers] on my father's side died, they were still in Elmo, Texas.  So no, that was where that family stayed and that was their base of operations.  So you can imagine these scenes when the young lieutenant comes home to this country town, I mean he was a big hero. I mean he had seen Japan, I mean he had seen Hawaii and it was good for his family.  Now both of my mother's [Barbara Merriwether Rodgers] family and my father's family, I mean they both did reasonably well given the context, but my father essentially became a global citizen and that benefitted us.
Story_ID: 237551
Speaker 1: Let's talk a little bit now about your grandparents and we'll start with your maternal grandparents.  I know you didn't know your grandfather--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --but can you tell us a little bit about your grandmother starting with her name and?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Annie J. Merriwether, Seventh-day Adventist, strict disciplinarian.  When you heard the words, "Big mama wants ya," forget it, you might as well start warming up your behind at that time, because you had done something wrong and you were going to pay the price, but great value system.  Large woman, I'd say 5'10", 5'11", maybe 150 pounds, just strong, strong, strong.  Essentially raised not only her children, but the next two generations of our family, and when she left Texas a part of the family ended up in Compton [California], and just to see her sort of holding court in Compton.  I will tell you, the kids in our family did not get in trouble, because big mama was on the scene.
Speaker 1: And do you have any stories you'd like to share with us about you know, just you're, just her and you know any stories that you'd like to share with us?
Speaker 2: Well, I don't know, I was just always fascinated whenever we'd go to visit them that--as Seventh-day Adventists they would go to church on Saturday and they had all these sort of sundown activities and everything else, and it would--that in a way was sort of foreign to me, but what I, I respected was their faith and their belief and they were very religious and very strong and again I attributed that to the fact that our family has done reasonably well.
Speaker 1: And she moved to California with your family?
Speaker 2: Right, not my immediate family, but she moved when sort of the people started moving.  I mean first it was one person would move and then the rest of them would move, but the--I would say by the 1960s the entire family was in California or in the State of Washington and no one was left in Texas.
Speaker 1: And do you remember and, and was she like a traditional Seventh-day Adventist, at sundown there's.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: No talking.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: No playing.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes and you could imagine doing that with teenagers living in Compton where's there so much temptation, but again she maintained, and again I attribute a lot of my values to her values.
Story_ID: 237552
Speaker 1: Let's talk a little bit now about your paternal grandparents, starting with their names.
Speaker 2: Yeah, my grandfather's name was Marion Rodgers, and my grandmother's name was Sophie Rodgers and they were both farmers and I've a lot of fond memories.  Among the fond memories are food, and that's one of the great things about country families is the food.  I remember being shocked, one, not only did they kill the chicken right before they cook the chicken, but it, it wasn't unusual to have fried chicken for breakfast.  It was no big deal and thank God 'cause I loved fried chicken, so just to have the, to be able to see the whole process, to be part of--people's lives to actually live in a house that there were oil lanterns, I mean to have to, you had to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night to have to walk that you know, twenty-five yards to the outhouse and there's nothing scarier I will tell you and to a young kid having to go to the outhouse in the middle of the night in the country, but that all, also helped us and, and gave us a sense of values, and a sense of respect from where we all had come from, but even more important to me on that side of the family was to go into this again, this country house, these tar-paper houses, but there was a such, this sense of history and pride and they would have all those pictures in these sort of oval frames around the house and it'd be all these great--on my grandfather's side, these great sort of Native American people with all these hair dressings and this sort of great pride, and on my mother's side she had--on my grandmother's side there were pictures of, of not only the people who had been slaves but the people they'd intermarried with and the one shot I can remember is this very, very dark man, an Ethiopian getting off the boat in New Orleans [Louisiana] as a trader, coming in and he intermarried in the family and so just to walk through this sort of sense of history, and see where I came from, it made it all worthwhile.
Speaker 1: And did they ever talk about the people who were in the photographs and share stories with you about those who were in the photographs?
Speaker 2: No, and that is probably more my fault than their fault, you know again, as we generations change, I was caught riding the, in the generation where we were trying to be somebody else, where our, you know this was before James Brown told us you know, "Say it loud -- I'm black and I'm proud," so there was that period of time in which integration was the sole goal, and the best way to integrate was to be like them, and so you didn't deal as much with that as--we later did and so you moved forward, you didn't look back, and, and unfortunately that was part of my youth which I hopefully corrected.  So given their lifetime, I did not take as much advantage of their knowledge and their past as I should have.
Speaker 1: And how far back can you trace your ancestry?  You talked a little bit about your grandfather and his Native American heritage, but how far back and do you know if you came from free people, slaves, how far back?
Speaker 2: You know that's one of the great things about I think most African Americans, is that we came from all of it and so I know I came from free blacks, blacks who were slaves and Native Americans.  Although my mother's [Barbara Merriwether Rodgers] side it was all from freed slaves, in my father's side it was the Native American, the freed blacks and the slaves.
Story_ID: 237553
Speaker 1: When you think back, what is your earliest memory of growing up?
Speaker 2: It's in being in Texas and there's two early memories and both equal, one was there was this television show 'The Cisco Kid' and the Cisco Kid [Duncan Renaldo] and I think he has a sidekick Pancho [Leo Carrillo] came to Lubbock, Texas where my [maternal] grandmother [Annie J. Merriwether] lived when I was there with her for the summer, and I got to sit on the horse and have a picture taken of me and that was real cute, so I--that I remember, but I also remember my mother [Barbara Merriwether Rodgers] for whatever reasons decided I should go to the first grade when I was three years old.  Now the only way I could to go school, I couldn't go to public school at three, so she sent me to a Catholic school.  I was able to cope academically but I was still three and what I remember is the nuns paddling me because I wet my pants.  So where I was smart enough to go, I really wasn't mature enough to go and that is a memory I do have.
Story_ID: 237554
Speaker 1: Can you tell us a little bit about what holidays were like in your house growing up, and special occasions, birthdays, Christmas, Thanksgiving, what were those times like in your house growing up?
Speaker 2: Primarily they were just a reason to get the family together and I think you will hear throughout our conversation how important food is in not only my life, but in the lives of a lot of our families.  The fact is even though we were low income as most African American families were at the time, we ate well.  We really did, I mean the food the tasted delicious and smelled wonderful.  So what was a holiday, a holiday was really simply a time for us all to get together and share this wonderful food, because the fact is we had this wonderful food seven days a week, but the holidays was the time we'd see people we hadn't seen, where people would pull in there and show off their new little car or their new Ford, we'd all get together, but the fact is we were really a close-knit family anyway so we were together all the time.  So in the family sense the holidays were no more unique.  Now if you take my individual family, holidays were real special and the most special of those was Christmas.  My older brother [Alford Rodgers] and I would you know search the house for the gifts and Christmas morning was always special in sort of giving things, but in the whole, the holidays were simply a reason to get together.  There was nothing specific about what took place during the event but it was the opportunity to get together.
Speaker 1: And like say for example, Easter, was that an exciting time, did you always get new clothes at Easter time, that kind of thing?
Speaker 2: Well, no not really, you know, nor did we expect it.  You know I mean if you, you look at--and I'll just speak of my own children [David Rodgers and Jamie Rodgers] as an example, there are different expectations.  My brothers and I--we didn't expect anything and so we were grateful for whatever we got.  You know it wasn't a me generation, it was a us generation, and it was just a different world.  Didn't ask for anything, didn't expect anything, but had a very happy life.
Story_ID: 237555
Speaker 1: And can you give us an idea of what daily life was like?  You'd wake up in the morning and what was daily life like?
Speaker 2: Well, now here we go, now this is the bad side of being the child of a [U.S.] military officer.  My father [Marion Rodgers] believed it was so important that we represented not only ourselves, but people of color well, that he made us or forced us to you know to study, to be neat, to be respectful, to be clean.  So here's a typical day of me in the third grade living in San Francisco [California].  I'd get up, I would clean my room, I'd fix my bed, I'd lay my clothes out and my father would come for--to inspect the room.  I referred to all adult males as "sir" to all adult females as "ma'am" and I was clean, neat and well spoken.  God blessed me through my parents in that school has never been hard for me so I was never in trouble academically or anything like that, but on my father's side we were disciplined and respectful and on my mother's [Barbara Merriwether Rodgers] side was we all had to share.  So on that same day I'd go to school, come back from school and when I got back from school I would clean the bathrooms and vacuum the living room.  That was what we did without complaint--that was our contributions, but mostly of what I would do, was read.  I just loved reading and any free time I had from the age of three I would just read, read, read.
Speaker 1: And tell us a little bit about what the inspections were like, did--what would happen if--when you didn't pass?
Speaker 2: Oh no allowance, and sometimes we really messed up, you'd, you'd be spanked.
Speaker 1: And were the inspections as you know, one might envision like you know, the clothes were neatly laid out on the bed, everything in its place?  What, what--
Speaker 2: It was an eight year old's version of an inspection, I mean I didn't, my father did not come in and bounce a quarter off of my bed, I mean he wasn't a drill instructor, he was an officer, so he, he was an officer and a gentleman, but no, shoes were shined, clothes were arranged neatly and the bed was fixed.
Story_ID: 237556
Speaker 1: Can you give us the names of your siblings and their birth order including yourself?
Speaker 2: Yes, I have an older brother who's two and a half years older than me and his name is Alford [Rodgers], A-L-F-O-R-D and he currently works in Atlanta, Georgia for Philips electronics.  I have a nine and a half year, a brother who is nine and half years younger than I am and his name is Glenn [Rodgers] and he currently works in the computer industry and he lives in Northern California.
Speaker 1: And can you tell us a little bit about your community?  Do you remember the name of the street that you lived on and just what your community was like?
Speaker 2: Well yes and, and again being a [U.S.] military brat I have eighty-five different communities.
Speaker 1: Sure, which one do you remember the most or where did you spend the most time?
Speaker 2: Well I think the significant, there were two significant communities for me.  The first one is, and I still regard this as my home, is Oakland, California, and I was raised at 424 Stoneford Avenue in Oakland, California and in Oakland I was in the fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh grades.  Oakland is, was then and is still a ghetto.  I lived--the part of Oakland we lived in was a community called Brookfield Village [Oakland, California] which was quickly dubbed "quiet village" as in the sort of African things with sort of sounds coming out.  It was a hundred percent black community, nice house, small house on reflection, but it was a very, very interesting life.  It was there in Oakland that I joined the Boy Scouts [of America] and interestingly enough about the Boy Scouts and their sort of goal orientation, it wasn't cool to be a Boy Scout.  You know everybody else was you know in their gangster stuff and you know had the cigarettes rolled up and you got to be tough you know if you're going to make it in the ghetto.  You can't go around in a Boy Scout uniform.  So my father [Marion Rodgers] said to me, "Okay, I know you don't want to be here, you become an Eagle Scout," which is the top rank, "and you can get out."  Now that takes like four years, I said "Okay, I'll take you up on that deal".  I became an Eagle Scout in less than a year and immediately quit.  So I got to the top rank real quickly.  I said hell this, I like this system where you could achieve a goal quickly and then you sort of fall back.  So that one of the things that I learned in Oakland was, how do you get along with people, how do you be cool, but at the same time do what's the right thing to do.
Story_ID: 237557
Speaker 1: You know and Oakland [California] was also the place where you know you learned lessons.  Oakland was where I was living in 1958 when the schools were integrated in Little Rock [Arkansas] and all the trouble came and I mean, I mean I remember being parts of a group where we'd go and beat up white people just as a sort to get our frustration out.  I remember being beaten up myself in Oakland just because that's what people did was beat you up.  One of my amazing sort of revelations, I don't know how this came was--also it's a part of growing up in Oakland and being part of this group, we use to steal a lot.  We'd go, we'd steal potato chips or we'd steal candy bars and I remember once never being caught but just realizing how wrong that was, wrong not from the sense that we could do it or anything else, it was wrong that his poor person who owned this store was going to lose something, so I got a lot of good, bad experiences in Oakland that I was able to correct later or at that time, and so this Oakland sort of existence was really, really important to me.  Interestingly enough I went to a place called Brookfield Elementary School [Oakland, California] and again, not mature enough to sort of understand this.  I told you earlier about being in the first grade at three.  So by the time we're in the fourth grade I'm still sort of younger than I should be but they had these tests that you would take, and, and achievement tests, academic tests.  I took a test and the person said, "Oh, you're smart enough to not be here", but instead of sending some advance courses you know what they did?  They said you're too smart to be in the class so here's what we want you to do.  So me and the other smart kid, well they did something good they would take us to the museums instead of sending us to class, but most of the time we'd sit making model airplanes or model cars 'cause they didn't what to do with us, and so was it a waste or time or not?  Probably not, we had fun but--as I reflected later in life I mean you know that's not what they do you know, again our parents [Barbara Merriwether Rodgers and Marion Rodgers] were good and sophisticated but they weren't that sophisticated where they knew, let's send this kid to a private school and let's do something else, nor maybe not have been able to afford it.
Speaker 2: Or demand.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: That he be put in advanced placement.
Speaker 1: You know, again but like me they just took great pride, "Oh gee, look Johnny's [HistoryMaker Johnathan Rodgers] grades are really good or Johnny got great test scores," but it sort of ended there.  So I look back with some regret on that, but boy did I have a great time.
Story_ID: 237558
Speaker 1: Going back to your neighborhood, was it a fairly middle class neighborhood?  Were there teachers and other professionals that lived in the neighborhood or were there all kinds of people who lived in the neighborhood?
Speaker 2: I would say we were more a lower middle class neighborhood and you know cars in the streets and five cars in the driveway, but it was our life and it's what we knew and it's all we cared about and, and we didn't want for anything else.  All we wanted was to be cool amongst ourselves and, and we were.  I mean you know we would live for Saturday dance to Saturday dance you know which--in somebody's basement.   Maybe this is a good way to describe the neighborhood; the smell of chitterlings cooking was not unusual in the neighborhood.
Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] Mr. [Johnathan] Rodgers if you will, tell me what sights, sounds and smells remind you of growing up and remind you of your childhood?
Speaker 2: Freeways, Brookfield Village [Oakland, California] was sort of bordered by a freeway.  We'd walk over the freeway to go to school, and the school playground was right next to the freeways so that sort of sound and the feel of freeways reminds me of Oakland [California].  Standing on the street corner in groups of young boys reminds me of Oakland.  This sort of sense that because we were black we could run faster, jump higher, play sports better, be better entertainers and musicians is true to me because when we go to play other schools we just assumed we could win 'cause we were black.  You know, I was talking about being in the Boy Scouts [of America] and then sort of rushing to get to the highest rank so I could get out, but even the fact that when we were Boy Scouts we'd go to these jamborees, you know and there'd be very few just troops of just blacks, but I remember then we were competent there and all and they would have talent shows.  I remember one talent show; our act was to do the hambone now the hambone goes way back to slavery and people slapping their knees, but we saw nothing wrong with that.  We were so cool and of course we won and then what was even better was a lot of the other troupes that weren't African American assumed that we didn't know anything or couldn't do anything so even on the map reading and the compass reading and those sort of games we would win.  So we just cleaned up, so it was just a great, great existence.  This sort of sense of pride, this sense of achievement and the sense of, yes we could do anything, yes we're black and it's because we're black we can do anything.  So it was just a great sort of feeling, and again I talked about Little Rock [Arkansas].  You know we fought back against Little Rock in our own sort of way.  We said this is who we are, this is what's right.  Don't abuse our brothers and sisters down there.  That's a message that came through us, and so we had this great sense of pride.  Now in Oakland there existed in the hills and the skyline area places where the doctors lived and the teachers lived and the superintendents lived, and yeah, we saw them differently than we saw us, but it was okay because we were the ones we thought we had all the fun.
Story_ID: 237559
Speaker 1: Do you think kids today, African American children have that sense of pride in terms of being black and that kind of thing and have a sense of pride about that?
Speaker 2: I think yes they do and they certainly should but I think it's less important intellectually.  The fact is they are growing up in a time in which Nickelodeon exists that shows its wonderful multi-cultural world.  They're growing up in a time where PBS [Public Broadcasting Service] exists, and, and 'Sesame Street,' and, and when they see this country, it's not all white, it's not all black, it's not all brown, it's all of us together.  So they just have a different sense, but as African Americans there's this great sense of our contributions to the culture.  Now people in my generation like to think that we're the ones who have created this culture we live, and we've made great number of contributions, but the fact is the contemporary African Americans dominate the style culture, they dominate the music culture and they have, and it's without shame.  I mean the hip hop culture is a strong culture onto itself, it apologizes to no one.  Everybody else tries to join it, it doesn't try to become anything else, and I think that's the big difference.  We wanted to integrate into their society, now the society wants to integrate into our society.
Story_ID: 237560
Speaker 1: Let's talk a little bit about elementary school.  Do you remember the name of the Catholic school that you went to when you were three years old?
Speaker 2: No, and that was in Texas and I hope to never remember that name and the fact is we weren't even Catholics we were Baptists but that, yeah that's the only place I could go to school at that time at that age and again, truly, all I could remember were the spankings.
Speaker 1: And so when the family moved to California do you remember the name of your elemen--your first elementary school that you attended?
Speaker 2: Well, after leaving Texas my father [Marion Rodgers] was transferred to Japan and we were transferred to Japan, and now we're in nineteen--geeze--fifty-two [1952], and this was during the Korean War so when we get to Japan there are a lot of things to remember about Japan, one of the things is the school.  When I got to Japan they said to me, and I think I was in the second grade at the time, "You're four years old--you can't be in the second grade.  You're supposed to be in kindergarten".  So they kept me in the first grade an extra year.  They were going to keep me another year, but my mother [Barbara Merriwether Rodgers] to her everlasting credit lied about my age.  She told them I was a year older than I was, so where I was two years ahead before then, I was only one year ahead, but I remember--what I remember at that school was coming home, it's just in sort of disbelief saying to my mother, you know, "They were doing this story today in school about Br'er Rabbit and Uncle Remus and people were pointing their fingers at me and laughing at me and calling me names."  I don't recall how she responded, but I still recall that pain.  So that's really all I remember about that school and that's all I remember about school until we left Japan and came back to San Francisco [California] and then Oakland [California] and don't--
Speaker 1: Do you remember, do you remember some of your teachers at that school?
Speaker 2: I don't remember any of my teachers at all, at all until, I, I'm thinking until high school [Rantoul Township High School, Rantoul, Illinois], until the ninth grade, oh no I'm sorry, the eighth grade.  I don't remember any of the teachers and I think there's no reason that I don't.  I remember a lot of the things that they did.  I don't remember any of their names, nor was any one of them special in my life as in putting their arm around me or taking care of me or helping guide me through my life.  Again, school was really easy for me so I tended to go, do what I needed to do, do it as well as I could and then just sort of move on.  My high school memories are mostly of, of young girls, and just being totally fascinated with, with young girls and how they were sort of different than us, and different shape than us and again, when you're raised in communities like Oakland, even if you're in grade school, those parties we had with the lights down low and the slow dancing truly you couldn't think of anything else but girls, and that's all I thought about.
Story_ID: 237561
Speaker 1: Going back to the family's move to Japan--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Do you remember just what the mood was in the house and what the family's reaction was that, you know, you all were leaving, going to another country?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was too small to remember that, but what I do remember is how we got to Japan.  Again, because it was during the Korean War we went to Japan on a warship and I remember seeing the big guns on the ship and we would--we sailed over, over there to Japan and I remember we had in our own yard as did every other family had, we had family fox holes and I remember being--seeing airplanes struggling to make it back from some battle in Korea crashing and people dying.  So it was more those sort of memories of your friends whose parents were killed or were lost or were fighting the War than any other memory about us specifically.  An interesting concept again being a [U.S.] military officer in Japan, is we always had help in our house.  So we would have Japanese maids or yard people and that also I think helped broaden my experience and understand people, understand other cultures and understand how you respect other people, and you know whereas people in this country may have had a nanny I had a Japanese nanny who sort of raised me and, and I do remember that fondly.
Story_ID: 237562
Speaker 1: Let's talk a little bit about school in Oakland [California] and you said you know you were a very good student.  Do you remember some of your friends from elementary school [Brookfield Elementary School, Oakland, California] and some of the things that you enjoyed doing with your time?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I still have friends from elementary school, and friends of friends from elementary school because again I regard Oakland as my home and we have a number of relatives there.  What I remember is and, and is this concept of--okay if I, if I--based on the record I think I'm pretty smart so that part's easy, but what I really wanted to be was cool.  So I wanted to dance well and at that time I did dance well.  I wanted to dress well and I remember I dressed well but also wanted to be a star athlete, and I really thought--I psyched myself into believing, hey you're black so you are a star athlete--wasn't the case.  I, I once held for a short time the fifty-yard dash record at our school but that was it.  I mean I had to struggle athletically but that was really what was most important to me was to be a sports star and I never made it.
Speaker 1: And during the elementary years what type of child were you?
Speaker 2: Well my children [David Rodgers and Jamie Rodgers] hate hearing this and my--but I was pretty good, I was pretty well-behaved and, and respectful and, and how do you gain respect?  Again, I gained respect because my father [Marion Rodgers] brought to us a sort of [U.S.] military bearing, a sort of logic and organization, but at the same time my mother [Barbara Merriwether Rodgers] took us to the Baptist church, Mount Zion [Missionary] Baptist Church [Oakland, California] in Oakland every Sunday and I learned there, at least I interpreted there from the sermons I heard that not only did God want you to behave, but God would punish you if you didn't behave.  And talk about your guilt, I know Catholics have guilt, but I got some Baptist guilt I will tell you.  Until this day I think that if I even tell a small lie I've committed a major sin and shame on me and I need to ask forgiveness.  So between the military discipline and the strong Baptist discipline, I can't recall that many times that I was actually in trouble growing up in Oakland.  I remember once, and at the time I just was crazed about it.  Once I had my bicycle stolen at school, and my father blamed it on me.  Now, here I'm a ten-year old kid, living in the ghetto in Oakland where people steal stuff all the way and I get my bicycle stolen and it's my fault, and it took me until I had children of my own to really understand the message my father was trying to teach me, which was, you know you live in Oakland, you know you live in a place where people steal, then put the bike in a place where it won't get stolen, think it through. But it took me years, and years, years to forgive him for that bit of discipline because I thought it was unfair, but again when you think you're perfect and you think it's unfair so.  It was, that was something that I sort of will never forget.
Story_ID: 237563
Speaker 1: Tell me a little bit about your family's experiences in church [Mount Zion Missionary Baptist Church, Oakland, California], was it the typical Baptist church where you spent just about your entire Sunday morning and afternoon there?  What were your family's experiences like in church?
Speaker 2: Well interestingly enough the experience was, which is followed through to the current day is my father [Marion Rodgers] didn't go to church.  Today I don't go to church, the rest of the family goes.  So what was good about church was Sunday school, because again that's like class and I love class, I love reading, I love talking to the point where my nickname in Sunday school was "loud speaker," 'cause I'd always be so loud and talking and acting like I knew everything.  So I truly enjoyed Sunday school because it was an (unclear) exchange.  Church went too long, the music didn't mean that much to me at the time.  I think the highlight of the church was I was baptized and to be baptized was when they put you in the water and held you down (laughter).  I remember thinking, I was wondering--is this guy ever going to let me up here, but then you know you'd get up and they say you're born again and all this sort of stuff.  I don't know if I was born again or needed to be born again, but clearly the messages got through to me about how one should live one's life and that's the message I tried to preach to my children [David Rodgers and Jamie Rodgers], because in the Ten Commandments and in the basic concepts of, love thy neighbor, or, or treat people the way you want to be treated yourself, that's all we need to live by.  Now, do I live my life like that because I'm still in fear of committing a sin?  Probably is a good portion of that, but what I'm trying to do now is to be able to intellectualize those same values to my children so it's not out of fear that they live their lives that way, they live their lives that way because it's the right way to live your life.
Speaker 1: And, you know, a comedian, I forget who it is that always talks about how, you know, dad never went to church and how, you know, he'd always ask his momma, "How come dad doesn't have to go?"--did you ever do that or question, you know, "How come you're not going?" that kinda thing?
Speaker 2: You don't question the major (laughter), but my children question me, or they, that, that line exists in my household, "Why is dad--doesn't have to go?" And unfortunately I sort of cheat.  My wife [Royal Kennedy] is an Episcopalian and I claim that their service is a little too dull for me which is why I don't go.  The real reason is I'm not much into organized religion, so that's why I choose not to go, but I hope to maintain those values and spread them as much as I can--
Story_ID: 237564
Speaker 1: During the elementary school [Brookfield Elementary School, Oakland, California] years, that timeframe, did you have dreams and aspirations and did you think about what you wanted to be when you grew up and what were some of your thoughts?
Speaker 2: What I thought was I wanted to be in a profession where, and I know this sounds like a cliche, where I could help other people.  This sort of service attitude, I have no idea where it came from, but I think it comes from sort of a translation of blessings you get into, sort of, how can you use those.  So my dreams were how could I help people and I thought the best way I could help people was through communication.  What were my options?  These are the two options I carried from grade school to junior high into high school [Rantoul Township High School, Rantoul, Illinois] before making a decision.  I was either going to be a minister or a journalist.  To me it was the same thing, it was addressing an audience with hopefully what was the truth and by addressing them with the truth, giving them information by which they could have a better life which would make a better society.  So how this concept came to me at an early age is beyond me but I wanted to be in a position where I could communicate information and values to a large group of individuals.
Speaker 1: And had you ever met or seen an African American journalist?
Speaker 2: I had never; I had of course read the Jet like everybody else did, but didn't even African Americans existed as journalists and certainly not on TV.  Now I come from this generation, you know whenever a black was on TV we'd shout it up and down the streets and watch it because it was so rare, but no, had never seen a print journalist of color, I'd never seen a television journalist of color and had never heard a radio journalist of color.
Speaker 1: And nonetheless still wanted to be one.
Speaker 2: Yep, I had the minister; I'd seen plenty of black ministers so I knew that was an option as well.
Story_ID: 237565
Speaker 1: So let's move a little bit to middle school, middle school years, do you remember where you were living around middle school, was that still Oakland [California]?
Speaker 2: Well in the seventh grade I was in Oakland, in the eighth grade I was in Okinawa [Island, Japan], and in Okinawa my father [Marion Rodgers] was then transferred there and now we're at 1958, and what I remember most about my education in the eighth grade was I got a D in Latin and I don't get Cs and rarely get Bs.  I got a D in Latin and to this day I'll remember one of the questions I missed on the exam which, he gave the Latin word and you're supposed to say what the English equivalent was and the word was, I mean it was the initial K dash and the letter 9, K-9.  Of course, canine, that's canine, you know it's the Latin word for dog.  I just couldn't figure it out so I stopped taking Latin for the rest of my life, but that's what I remember most was the D that I got in Latin.
Speaker 1: And so you were a little older now.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: In Japan.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And did you go to a school on post or?
Speaker 2: It was, it was a [U.S.] military school and to the credit of the military these schools were multicultural.  I mean it was not only blacks and whites, but there were a lot of Asians and because there was so many Filipino workers on the military base in Okinawa, it was a number of Filipinos, and, and so you know my whole existence after the sort of Texas, Oakland days, is sort of this, this multicultural integrated world in which rarely did you sort of think about race.  Now when do you think about race, you think about race, when you get a bad grade, and they give me that bad grade 'cause I'm black.  You think about race when you ask the one girl who you think you'd like out for a date and she says, "No," and you wonder if she says "No" because you're black.  There are no other black girls to ask so you got to ask somebody.  You think about race when you're playing touch football and you're the first person picked, they think you're good because you're black and the fact is you're just as average as they are, so--but it wasn't a constant in my mind.
Speaker 1: And what was the make-up of the school, were you like one of the only blacks in many of your classes or?
Speaker 2: The answer is, is no because as the military is so well integrated that there were blacks throughout the school system.
Speaker 1: And what did you think, you're, you know, right at the beginning of your teenage years that you're moving from Oakland to Japan, do you remember that conversation in your house and what your reaction--
Speaker 2: Yes, that's another adventure, and again--
Speaker 1: So you embraced it?
Speaker 2: Oh absolutely, oh no we, we all became better for it.  I mean we--our body clocks were sort of attuned to moving every two and a half to three years.  So it was--Texas, you know, to Japan, to San Francisco [California], to Oakland to Okinawa to Illinois, so no, we'd do this all the time and, and it's interesting a lot of people whose parents were in the military especially people who were African American sort of had this same sort of feeling and this ability to sort of get right in and that's what the military does for you.  So when you move I mean you don't miss a beat in the military when you move because everyone expects that there's new people every year and this is how we adjust to them.
Story_ID: 237566
Speaker 1: One of the things we didn't talk about is, what was your relationship like as a child with your brothers [Alford Rodgers and Glenn Rodgers], did you all play together a lot or because of the age difference with your youngest brother?
Speaker 2: Yeah, the youngest brother we'll get to, to later but my older brother who was two and a half years, that's the right amount of years where he doesn't want me hanging around--didn't want me hanging around, and he was smarter than I was.  So here he was smarter than I was, a better athlete than I was, better looking than I was and didn't want me around.  So no, we were not that close.  We had good respect for each other but I was a tag along.
Speaker 1: And were you a typical middle child?
Speaker 2: I am a typical middle child and the fact is--I am the one to solve all disputes, and the fact is you know when the parents [Barbara Merriwether Rodgers and Marion Rodgers] die I'm the one who will take over, I'm the one who will be the executor.  That is my role and, and as a middle child I think a lot of us do that, we know how to do that.
Speaker 1: And during middle school and the junior high school years, what type of young man were you starting to evolve into and starting to become?
Speaker 2: As I matured I became shy and bashful and somewhat insecure (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Loud speaker from Sunday school was--
Speaker 2: Absolutely because now I'm not amongst our people, I'm in a different world, a foreign world and as you move you got to introduce yourself all over again and then you get, sort of get insecure, and insecure as what I now look back on--sort of racism and stereotypes.  Yes a lot of people thought knew you already and knew you were a certain thing and you wanted to be who you were, and so no as I got older became less and less self-assured.
Story_ID: 237567
Speaker 1: What about your dreams and aspirations, did you still have the same dreams and aspirations or were they starting to change?
Speaker 2: No, they still were the same but as happens in all young men's lives, I really was more concerned about girls, and, and I'm not saying this to be facetious but sort of just to describe the, not only the social temperament, but what it does for the rest of your life.  So you throw a young man in a situation in which there are no African American women, or one or two and they're your cousins, how do you--what's your self-value, and what says to you that people respect you or like you, and because it's male-female relationships that oftentimes seem more to be the honest relationships, the fact that people didn't even see you, that you were and I will tell you by the time I was in ninth grade I had read Ralph Ellison-- then I finally got what was going on, but no--it was sort of this feeling of being lost, of being--well maybe I'll just sort of low-key this and sort of not be upfront, not shout and scream who I am, but sort of do what my father [Marion Rodgers] had done is, is achieve things based on merit.  So all of a sudden then it became real important to me not to just get good grades, but to get the best grades.  It became important to me not to do a project, but to do the best project and so again, it was no longer important to me to be cool, I mean cool among my peers.  What was important to me was to lay a groundwork by which I could be measured by the same standards everybody else was being measured by, and one of the standards being measured by in, in junior high or high school [Rantoul Township High School, Rantoul, Illinois], it is grades and that's what I said I'm going to do it and I'll show 'em.
Story_ID: 237568
Speaker 1: And who was influencing you at this time, who were you most influenced by at this time in your life?
Speaker 2: You know, I got to say--it was God, because I don't recall my parents [Barbara Merriwether Rodgers and Marion Rodgers] saying, "You study between three and six, you do this," or I don't recall them saying, "if you haven't finished your homework do this," I don't recall them saying, "let me check your paper."  All of this just happened, you know I think about this, and my parents were really blessed and lucky because between my older brother [Alford Rodgers] and I--they had not a single disciplinary or academic concern.  So they had a great life, and--but for me and I again, it was you know--one of my favorite periods of time was in high school [Rantoul Township High School, Rantoul, Illinois].  When I was in high school there was a place called Rantoul, Illinois.  There was a [U.S.] military base there--it's downstate Illinois about 120 miles south of Chicago [Illinois].  At this school at that time they gave numerical grades, not like three's or fours or fives, it was a hundred, or ninety or an eighty whatever else, and I remember getting all hundreds, you know and I said this is cool and it was easy and in this was a school in which there were only about six African Americans, and so to have that position, that just said a lot to me, yet still insecure and I remember the picture, the National Honor Society, I'm sort of just slouching in my chair just sort of, and you could see it in me and 'cause sitting around me are all these people who I really wanted to sort of be their friends or boyfriends, too, or whatever else, and it just wasn't there, and, and, and it just--so even having achieved these things it didn't feel right.
Story_ID: 237569
Speaker 1: So let's talk a little bit about high school, now what was the name of the high school that you attended?
Speaker 2: Yeah after we left Okinawa [Island, Japan] my father [Marion Rodgers] was transferred to a place called Chanute Air Force Base [Rantoul, Illinois] which is in downstate Illinois about 120 miles south of Chicago [Illinois].  It's located in a town called Rantoul, R-A-N-T-O-U-L, and it's really primarily a [U.S.] military town and a farm town.  So I went to a high school called Rantoul Township High School [Rantoul, Illinois], and I started there in the ninth grade and had four wonderful great years, primarily academically.  I just seemed to be at this period of my life where, where all my synapses and my intellectual curiosity was just working and I just had a marvelous time.  I learned a lot but somehow was able to develop this great skill of taking tests and, and sort of answering questions and so I just, I sort of aced the school and I was quite pleased.
Speaker 1: And let's just talk a little bit about some of your experiences in high school, do you remember some of your teachers from high school?
Speaker 2: I do, I remember one of my favorite teachers was my English teacher, Don Nagel [ph.]; my journalism teacher continues to correspond with me until this date because it was at this school in the ninth grade and I had talked before about sort of dreams of wanting to communicate, be a journalist, be a minister or whatever else. It was there at Rantoul that I truly woke up one morning and said, you know, I think I want to be a journalist, and I really went and joined at the campus, the high school newspaper that day and that essentially has become my profession since then and the journalism teacher at the school whose unfortunately a name I can't think of at the moment, Mrs. [Mary C.] Greenwood mentored me, followed me through college [University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, California] and then followed me through the rest of my professional career.  She took a real interest in me and that was also something that made school worthwhile.
Story_ID: 237570
Speaker 1: What were some of the other subjects that you enjoyed in high school [Rantoul Township High School, Rantoul, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: I enjoyed them all, biology, history, English, science, math especially.  I, I was a math wizard and, and what I loved about math, and again you know it all comes down to again, I try to create this world in which logic wins and in which there's only one right answer, and what better subject than math.  You know, it wasn't somebody could say, "Well, I don't agree with you," or, "you wrote that the wrong way," or, "that's your interpretation, I disagree".  Math, there was one right answer, and I loved that fact and I was able to get the right answer so.  Again, high school was a dream for me academically.  Athletically I wrestled for a couple of years because I was still small.  I was able to wrestle at 112 pounds even in my junior year so you could tell how skinny I was, but again I wasn't great.  I went out for the track team, I was okay, I wasn't great.  I was in the high school play, that was fun you know, so there are a lot of good memories and bad memories.  We even had our little race riot, you know but how could you have a race riot when there's six of us and there's you know 150 of them.
Speaker 1: Well tell us about what, what happened?
Speaker 2: Well, it, it was, as usual, over one of the few black men dated you know one of the white girls and so they went crazy, you know, so--and this was the early '60s [1960s] so we had to stand up for our rights, but again imagine being in a school where there only again, a handful of African Americans, no African American teachers, no African American administrators, and most African Americans who were at the school essentially were coming and going with the [U.S.] military.  I remember there was one African American who was from a farm and his name happened to be Willie [ph.], but we all used to sort of laugh at him because he was the black farm boy--
Story_ID: 237571
Speaker 1: What was Rantoul [Illinois] like around that time?
Speaker 2: Well, it, it's one of these--it's a town of 27,000 people.  I mean there's no, there-there, you know bowling was big but the highlight for us was driving the fifteen miles to Champaign-Urbana [Illinois] where there were a whole bunch of black people.  So we, we go to Champaign-Urbana to go to church, to hang out with people.  In fact I went to Urbana [Illinois] to get my prom date in order to bring back to Rantoul.  So our cultural center was Champaign-Urbana because there was no cultural African Americans in Rantoul, but at--Rantoul wasn't a hateful town it was just a small town.
Speaker 1: And were you looked at differently as an African American among your classmates because you were [U.S.] military, too, and sometimes you know people will see you a little differently when you're military; was that the case at all?
Speaker 2: Well no because the military was so dominant in the town that it wasn't just the blacks who were from those areas you know most of the whites were from the military as well.  No, I, I think if anything I was only looked at unusually because of my academics based on their stereotypes of what they thought African Americans were.
Story_ID: 237572
Speaker 1: And dreams and aspirations at this point in high school [Rantoul Township High School, Rantoul, Illinois] solid--"I want to be a journalist"?
Speaker 2: Well yeah and again, you know, here I am, you know sixteen years old, you know how mature are you at sixteen, and so I, you know as I reflect backwards I'm really glad I was sort of young because I would've been angry if I were older and more mature and had all these other sort of feelings.  So I was able to sort of exist, I mean I didn't go to bed crying or, woe is me, but I did wonder you know, if ever the American society would be a place in which I didn't have to think about things like this or I could just feel comfortable where people could be accepted based on their own color and their own ability, and again, but this time the Civil Rights Movement is going on down south so it's obvious to everybody every day that there exists this class system in the U.S. That there exists this system based on race in the U.S. and it's not just stopped at the Mason-Dixon Line. But at the same time again I'm as naive in some ways as are the rest of the people.  I have not a clue as a high school senior what a Jewish person looks like.  I could never recall ever having spoken to a Jew, I believed the stereotypes about Jews, so I can't be critical of other people.  It's lack of information, lack of knowledge, I had zero, and even reading the great books that I was reading I had a sense of them, but I had no sense of them individually, and it was sort of thinking that way that I, I gained some understanding of the way people looked at me 'cause they had no knowledge of it, but in places like that, in small town America, you don't know a lot.

Speaker 1: What were some of your thoughts about college when you were in high school [Rantoul Township High School, Rantoul, Illinois]?  What were your thoughts about college?
Speaker 2: Interestingly enough one, that it was the expectation, that it wasn't any thought--the question was never asked, whether you will or not.  Unlike students today I was not stressed as to whatever college I would go to, but again, go back to the immaturity of both myself and this and I'll assign to my family.  I mean we just weren't sophisticated and I remember taking the ACTs and the SATs and doing really, really well to the point where the colleges are writing me, and going to my high school counselor and him saying to me, "No, I don't think you want to go to one of these Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts]-Yale [University, New Haven, Connecticut] schools, I mean they're really too old," and my buying into it 'cause I didn't know any better.  I mean that's how unsophisticated I was.  How a person can be real smart intellectually and so unsophisticated, that was me and I lucked out and ended up going to Berkeley [University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, California] because I remembered that as the Boy Scout in Oakland [California], one of the field trips we took was a Saturday to visit the University of California campus for a football game, and I remember walking by not recalling anything else other than the smell of the eucalyptus trees on the campus.  So when it comes time to pick a college and I essentially have the choice of wherever I want to go.  I ended up picking the University of California at Berkeley simply because I remembered the smell of the eucalyptus, and I'm truly glad.  I'm beginning to think that was a God-driven decision because the four years I spent there really dictated and created the person I am today.

Speaker 1: You had said earlier, during the high school [Rantoul Township High School, Rantoul, Illinois] years, you know many of your thoughts were about girls not unlike many other young men.  What--how, how did that all play out especially being in Rantoul [Illinois] and you know like you said oftentimes you all would go to Champaign-Urbana [Illinois] but what were you know did you date a lot or--
Speaker 2: Well we might as well get the dating question over with now.  I never dated till' I got out of college [University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, California] so again I assign a lot of that to my shyness and my immaturity, but I thought about dating a lot in high school and college and in thinking about it in high school, you know you want to be like everybody else and you want to like who you want to like, and, and if you have this dream of this colorless world you sort of don't say, "I like her because she's black," or, "I don't like her 'cause she's not black," so I just saw the whole world as being open, so clearly whereas there was interracial dating going on, there was no interracial dating going on in my life, and so the fact is I would--my one date the prom, I would go to Champaign-Urbana and, and found people to date, but we had a lot parties and there were enough of us, if you (unclear) enough of us where, where we could enliven a basement you know three times a month--
Story_ID: 237575
Speaker 1: And what year did you graduate from Rantoul [Township] High School [Rantoul, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: I graduated from high school in 1963.
Speaker 1: And so you've made the decision--actually let me ask you this.  So as you know around like your senior year in the height of the Civil Rights Movement taking place down south, what were your thoughts about that, were you wishing you could be there and be a part of it or, you know, do your part in the Midwest?  What were your thoughts about that?
Speaker 2: It was during this period in high school that this, the concept of journalism really came to fruition, and it primarily came to fruition for me through reading about and watching television in order to stay up to-date as to what was happening in the Civil Rights Movement in the South; that it became this great sort of distant cause for me to intellectually and emotionally be part of those battles for equality.  So I think that really enhanced my interest in journalism but enhanced my interest in television journalism and television as a medium, because it truly was Dan Rather who brought me the news about what was going on in the South, and I believed what Dan was saying.  Not Dan Rather, it was Walter Cronkite, geez, blew that one again.  It was Walter Cronkite who I watched every night and I would watch Walter Cronkite every night before doing my home and after doing my homework and so I got this sort of better sense of the world, but what I loved about the Civil Rights Movement from the distance that I was, was the noble cause of it all.  It went back to me intellectually and emotionally, to the day sitting in the church and hearing the minister tell the stories about the trials and tribulations that the Israelites had to have or the Jews had or people who simply believed being beaten down, and, and I saw no difference in people who were being mistreated for the religious beliefs than people who were being mistreated for the color of their skin.  So I saw this as a religious cause, and so no, I was really involved in it emotionally, did not do anything about it, but certainly carried it in my soul.
Speaker 1: And what were some of your thoughts just in terms of--because this wasn't your life as an African American male as, as a black male child, this--but for, you know, many others in the South I mean this was their life, this was daily life, you know, having the colored fountains and that kind of thing so what were some of your thoughts because you weren't actually living this day-to-day as some others were?
Speaker 2: Oh, we lived it every day, I mean we--felt the discrimination.
Speaker 1: You did?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes absolutely, I mean it wasn't legal, obviously, but we knew there were places we weren't welcome or places they didn't want us to hang with them.  You know, again even though it was the '60s [1960s], we still had our separate parties and our separate dances 'cause the music wasn't the same, but it was still the memories of my father [Marion Rodgers] being demeaned in the '40s [1940s] and the '50s [1950s] that I never left, so, so to me us trying to pull up to this gas station to get something to eat and being told "No" was no different ten, fifteen years later than what people were going through in the South at that time.  So I felt they were not only fighting our collective battle, but they were fighting my past battles.
Speaker 1: And when you would watch the news and you'd watch the reporting that was taking place, did you ever think, wow, you know, I would do this differently, I would talk to you know these kinds of people, I'd do this story differently but, were--did you ever think that?
Speaker 2: No, because again at fifteen and sixteen I was simply a cog, I was simply a citizen and I was absorbing information.  I never put myself in the sense of what I would do "if."
Story_ID: 237576
Speaker 1: And so you make the decision to go to college and so tell us a little bit about what that was like when you first arrived on campus?
Speaker 2: First of all you know leaving Rantoul [Illinois] for Berkeley [California] was no big deal for me having left places to go to Japan or go to Hawaii or go to Okinawa [Island, Japan].  I had left to go so, it was no big deal.  You know I remember you know getting out there and, and getting ready to go to campus, and again just--I, I felt good about myself; I didn't think it was going to be a challenge.  I moved into a dorm which was a, a--what we called a co-op at the time, where you had to work like five hours a week to help lower your, your amount of room and board and so I met people right away, and, and again it has to be God's blessings because it's not anything necessarily that I did, but it was the perfect four years. I mean I'll talk about them individually but just overall what happened to me in my four years at Berkeley [University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, California] and how it helped turn me into the person I believe I am today.  My first year I was able to demonstrate for civil rights, it was in San Francisco [California], but we were marching from the hotels and the auto dealerships pushing for equality for jobs, for respect, at the same time half the student bodies were down south doing that.   My second year we all demonstrated for free speech in the Free Speech Movement [FSM] that took over Berkeley.  My third year we'd stand in front of the troop trains taking people to the open [U.S.] Army terminals to ship them off to Vietnam, and my fourth year we were able to fight had and get a black studies department [Department of African American Studies] at the university.  So there's four years of taking sort of this intellectual learning, these observations and actually put them into action.  So having sort of laid the groundwork, I get to Cal [University of California, Berkeley], the first time I hear about it they are demonstrating in the hotel, the Sheraton Palace Hotel [The Palace Hotel, San Francisco, California] in San Francisco because they only want to hire African Americans to be maids or butlers.  I remember getting on the bus and going with these people and, and I said, "Geez, this is interesting."  Now all of a sudden I'm a participant, and that what college said to me, that--now you're an adult--yeah, seventeen years old.  You're an adult, you're free, and what do you choose to do with your life?  I chose to go and, and I--it felt good to march with these people.  Again, it wasn't, I wasn't--we weren't getting beaten by cops or bitten by dogs or washed--we were getting washed by water hoses, but it felt good and so I think I started to mature at that time, and in doing this I met people of like minds, who sort of adopted me and they recognized my naivete, but that sort of started me off on this system of feeling that we had the ability to correct wrongs.
Story_ID: 237577
Speaker 1: At the same time the first thing I'd done on campus [University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, California] was to join the student newspaper [The Daily Californian; Daily Cal] and, and then it was that day, a month into our first semester that President [John Fitzgerald] Kennedy was shot, and so all of a sudden, everything changed.  All our lives changed, but all of a sudden we journalists were sort of valued.  I mean we were the ones who were able to tell the story.  So it was more my going back to the dorm after Kennedy is shot, after having been at the newspaper and sort of just sitting back and observing how we covered that event, we--the media covered that event.
Speaker 2: The media in general?
Speaker 1: Yes and how it--put us all together and whether we were in the same room watching television or whether we were on the phone to our parents or whatever else, we all had the sense of sharing something that was immensely important to us, and it was that event, the coverage of the Kennedy assassination and the funeral, that, that indicated to me there could be a greater good from this medium, and that greater good could be bringing people together to share something.  Now at this time we hadn't passed the civil rights legislation.  People were still being beaten, so we hadn't seen the culmination of that media battle, but in just commemorating this event it brought all of us Americans together, and I said, you know, there's something special and unique about that medium.  One of my favorite Bible parables is Jesus with the fish and the loaves, you know, and, and he has one fish and one loaf but he shares it around everything else.  This was the sharing of emotion, the sharing of information and, and it worked, it brought us all together, and I think it just started something wonderful and really sort of helped imprint in my mind that this was a part of the media that I wanted to be in.
Speaker 2: And what was the mood on campus and what did it do for the students on campus.  Did it have the same effect for the students?
Speaker 1: It absolutely did, but again Berkeley [California] in the '60s [1960s] I mean it was a different type of place, so it meant a lot to us, but at the same time we didn't like [President] Lyndon [Baines] Johnson, so it was immediately--and we turned on Lyndon Johnson, but yeah it drew us all together, but less important to me than driving the students together, was driving the entire American population together.  To me that's the power, that the communication.  Now Billy Graham can do it, [HistoryMaker Bishop] T.D. Jakes can do it, so ministers can do it but how can we do it in the communications business, and it was that event and the respect by which we covered it that is still the philosophy by which I, I base my view of the media on.
Story_ID: 237578
Speaker 1: And do you remember some of the interviews you did and just you know some of the individual work that you did just in terms of covering a story?
Speaker 2: No, because primarily again I was a freshman and I was primarily an observer and it was primarily--it was the observation that was valuable to me not the actual covering of the--and the writing of it.
Speaker 1: And, so let's talk a little bit now about the Civil Rights passage [Civil Rights Act of 1964].  So what--do you remember from a media perspective how you all covered that and that kind of thing?
Speaker 2: Well, in fact that is another reason that I am in this business because it was both the local media's coverage of, of our participation in the Civil Rights Movement and the Free Speech Movement [FSM] that really said to me, I need to get in this business because what I participated in, what I did and what I said was not which was reflected in the newspapers or the television stations at the time, and I was crazed.  The distortion was unbelievable and again, young, immature but principled, it really bothered me.  When we would know on the issues for example on the hiring of [Sheraton Palace] Hotel [The Palace Hotel, San Francisco, California] employees, we had the statistics and where they would distort them and essentially do it from the owner's point of view or management's point of view and just sort of dismiss us or our points, just really bothered me.  During the Free Speech Movement, I'll never forget this, the Oakland Tribune [East Bay Times] had a picture of 'Mein Kampf' [Adolf Hitler] or something which was required reading in a lot of classes, and, and put on the front page of the Tribune of the Free Speech Movement: "And this book was found near the demonstrators."  You know, give me a break, I mean, so my first journalism teacher at Cal [University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, California] was a man named Pete Steffens who was Lincoln Steffens' son.  Now Lincoln Steffens is one of the great muckrakers of all times.  So imagine having his son be your first teacher and his first assignment I remember was, "Okay, I want you guys to go out and re-write the first chapter of Genesis and attribute all the facts and information."  So who are you going to attribute the fact that God made the world to, you know I mean it was a great exercise, but it made you think all of a sudden, you know, so it was just--it was heaven as far as I was concerned.
Speaker 1: And so and as you were watching this coverage were you then starting to think, if I were doing this, this aspect would be included in this story, this interview would be included?
Speaker 2: Not yet, still young and immature, still gathering information.  In fact I remember my sophomore year in a speech class.  Essentially you were supposed to talk about what you wanted to be in life.  I remember this white kid got up and he said his goal in life was to be the president of CBS News.  It had never entered my thoughts to ever think I could be the president of anything and even more damaging is, I never wanted to be the president of anything, and, I and, and so--hopefully my kids [David Rodgers and Jamie Rodgers] want to be president of everything, but it was never beaten into me that you could be the person in charge of something.  It was always do well, represent yourself well, it was never run something, be in charge of something.  So here's this guy saying he wants to be the president of CBS News and I'm saying I want to be a reporter at CBS News.  There's a huge disconnect.
Speaker 1: In terms of goals.
Speaker 2: Of goals, of aspirations, of values, I mean, he thought he was entitled to be the president of CBS News or had the right to be.  Now I had as much entitlement or right as he did, it just--it wasn't in here.  Now why wasn't it here, it's beyond me, but it wasn't fair, and I remember just reflecting after that, now why am I not thinking I should be the president of something like this, you know.  The fact is, you know, I got a lot closer than he did (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: But, that bothered me because somehow that was missing in my life and then I wondered if it was missing in a lot of other African Americans' lives that our goal was to do well, but not to control, not to run, and that started me thinking in a different way.
Story_ID: 237579
Speaker 1: And so, about what year was this when you--
Speaker 2: Oh, that's, that was my, my--that was my sophomore year, so I'm--we're now in 1964, '65 [1965].
Speaker 1: And so and how did that manifest itself, so you were starting to think in a different way?  Did you have an outward change or?
Speaker 2: Well yeah I became more aggressive and started to exercise what I thought was, was my ability.  So I primarily was interested in sports so I became the sports editor of The Daily Californian [Daily Cal] the campus newspapers my sophomore year, and normally you have to wait until you're a senior, and then the year after that I ran for editor, of the entire newspaper, did not get it, quit to do other things but that was the right attitude.  I thought I should've gotten it, I thought I was qualified to get it, don't hold my, my age against me, don't hold my, my class against me, but then I said, hey, I could've gotten that. So that was a major step for me that I didn't get something that I wanted, that I thought I was--I could do and so I quit and did other things.  So yeah I started to get that feeling and it really wasn't just hearing that other guy saying he wanted to be the president of CBS News and I never thought I wanted, I could be, it just set me free.  So at that point I started to try to run things that I was involved in, that I wanted to be responsible for things, and so I'd get in other campus organizations like the Black Student Union [BSU] and, and groups like that.  Even though I wasn't that great of an athlete I'd become the quarterback on the football team because he was the guy who ran the team, I, I then started to develop these sort of I hope are leadership qualities, but exercise leadership.  Try to set a tone, try to dictate a direction.
Speaker 1: And what other organizations were involved in?
Speaker 2: Well a lot of the secret organizations we can't talk about but no, a lot of the campus organizations, but even that--I was involved in the spirit organizations and there was even a, a short little minute in which I ran for head yell leader.  Now why would I run for head yell leader because again it goes back to minister, journalist or yell leader. Who at the University of California [Berkeley, Berkeley, California] got to address and affect the most people?  Not the student body president because only about 3,000 people out of 27,000 would vote in that race, it was the head yell leader who every Saturday got to get 12,000 students and have them do exactly what he or she wanted them to do.
Speaker 1: So what is a yell leader?
Speaker 2: He's the person who says, you know says, "Go Bears" or, or "Hold the line," or "Touchdown" you know those sort of things, but this is the person and especially on the West Coast, were mostly men and again, it was the control, it was the communication, I mean so I just dreamed about standing in front of these 12,000 people raising my arms and they'd all stand up and they and I'd say, "Give me a B," and they'd spell it out.  And I ran for a short little while and then pulled out because something else came up and I don't remember what but it was still the same goal, to reach as many people as possible and, and that's sort of what I was doing.
Story_ID: 237580
Speaker 1: Were you starting to come out of your shyness a little bit [at University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, California] and--
Speaker 2: Oh, I really was and, and again sort of this sort of leadership ability in wanting to do that but even more important than that--now this was the time of "Say it loud, I'm black and I'm proud" and the black students and, and the boldness of the black student body in the '60s [1960s].  Again be it civil rights or political or [the] Vietnam [War] I mean we were sort of leading those demonstrations.  The Black Panthers [Black Panther Party] were there and active, and, and they were respected on, on the campus, and, and I just remember [Reverend Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.] came to the campus and we, the black students, decided to boycott his speech.  To his credit, he said he understood and then came to speak to us afterwards, privately.
Speaker 1: Why did you want to boycott his speech?
Speaker 2: We said, with all due respect, Dr. King, given the nature of this society; we choose not to integrate into it.  We think they are not worthy of us.  They're over there in Vietnam killing people for no reason, they're discriminating against blacks in the South and we just listed the things wrong that they were doing, and, and we said we don't think integration's the answer any more.  There needs to be a better way for us to live together for us to respect each other, for us to acculturate, but integrate, if you're saying you want us to become more white, we don't want to do it.
Speaker 1: Do you remember what year this was?
Speaker 2: Probably 1966.
Story_ID: 235681
Speaker 1: We were around 1964, 1965 and [Reverend] Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] had come to Berkeley [University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, California] and the black students boycotted, and he came to speak to you all, can you tell us a little bit about that.
Speaker 2: Well it was a wonderful event because even though we didn't attend the speech, obviously we all had great admiration for Dr. King, and we told Dr. King that the reason we chose to boycott it is because we currently were disagreeing with his message of integration.  We thought with what was going on in the world with the Vietnam War, with the civil rights struggle, with sort of the economic disparity that we didn't know if we wanted to be integrated into the white society.  Why should we, who and we thought we had great values, want to be like them who we thought had awful values, and I think he understood what we were saying because it was soon thereafter that he came out publicly against Vietnam and, and in fact led the campaign against the war until he in fact died.
Story_ID: 235682
Speaker 1: Let's talk a little bit now about your senior year at Berkeley [University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, California], what was that like?
Speaker 2: Oh, well it was fun (laughter), yeah by this time, by the time I was a senior I really knew what I wanted to do which was to go into the field of journalism.  Beyond that I knew I wanted to go in the field of sports journalism.  Why sports journalism?  Here was a field in which everybody who was being written about was black, but there was no black people writing about them.  So here again, yet again, our culture's being interpreted by somebody else.  Our words are being interpreted by someone else.  Our actions, our attitudes are being interpreted by someone else.  It really bothered me and also it bothered me the way that the sports writers sort of you know--the lines were if you were a white player, "Oh, he's really smart" and if it's a black player, "he's really athletic," and that was wrong, and so I just one hand saw a great opportunity for an African American in the field of sports journalism but even beyond that I saw a real value in telling the African American story from an African American's point of view.  So I was real interested in sports journalism, I'd become sports editor of the campus newspaper [The Daily Californian; Daily Cal].  I got a job stringing or doing part time work for the Associated Press [AP], later the Oakland Tribune [East Bay Times] and between my junior and senior year--
Speaker 1: Stringing as a sports reporter?
Speaker 2: Stringing as a sports reporter, and between my junior and senior year a recruiter from Time magazine came out and offered me an internship at Time Incorporated [Time Inc.], which I took, so I went to New York [New York] after my junior year and spent the summer working at Time, Inc. in New York and fortunately I was able to work at Sports Illustrated and I met all the people at Sports Illustrated, got to know them and by the time I left that summer, they had offered me a full-time job once I graduated which I later did do.
Story_ID: 235683
Speaker 1: You had said earlier that you were thinking, you know, this story really needs to be done from an African American perspective, what were you thinking that you could add, what value did you think you could add to the reporting that you were seeing out there?
Speaker 2: You know it's sort of simple, I thought the main thing is I could humanize what the other sports writers had dehumanized, that, in fact, African American athletics were thinking, living, breathing human beings who were like everybody else and should be treated like everybody else.  They had a lot to say and then it turned out, in fact, their life wasn't as easy as we all thought it was, which is something I addressed, was able to address later at Sports Illustrated, but you know some of the great thrills were just to be able to walk into a locker room and the black guys see a black reporter, you could see the smiles on their face.  I, I remember covering a golf tournament, and at the time I had my big afro and I remember hearing in the gallery, "Oh, he must be from Ebony," or, "he must be from Jet."  I remember later hearing, "Oh he must be from 'The Mod Squad,'" you know, just the public, the galleries, the audience--they hadn't even seen black journalists and, and just, it's the wrong image of society.  I mean here, we're simply there for their amusement?  You know, everybody else is profiting off of these black athletics and we're not part of this?  We certainly didn't own any teams, we weren't managing or coaching any teams, we weren't even covering any teams.  It just seemed incomplete and again, as part of this whole (unclear) the '60s [1960s] thing, I wasn't going to sit still for what I saw as a major injustice.
Speaker 1: And were you offended by that, that people didn't assume, "Oh he must be from Sports Illustrated," or, you know, from some other--
Speaker 2: Not offended, I mean you expect that, you know this, this is our society but again, how would they know?  I mean, did they know that there were black writers at Sports Illustrated which there weren't, you know they knew what wasn't and so they were shocked and surprised.  No, you can't get mad at people for that; I mean I'm mad at society for that, I'm mad at the institution for that.  I mean, we've all improved greatly in journalism, but to be at a period of time which was the, the late '60s [1960s] in which there were so few African American sports writers that it was highly embarrassing.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 235684
Speaker 1: Let's go back a little bit to Berkeley [University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, California], how was your social life doing?  How, how were you doing socially?  You had had this change, you were a little bit more outspoken coming out of your shyness, how was your social life?
Speaker 2: Well, I'd like to add my four years of college to my four years of high school [Rantoul Township High School, Rantoul, Illinois] in which I--in which I never had a date.  So, no I didn't date, now did not date, oh, I know I didn't date; I wasn't cool enough to date. I didn't know how to ask a, a girl for a date.  I did join a fraternity, there was.
Speaker 1: Which fraternity?
Speaker 2: The Alphas.
Speaker 1: Alpha Phi Alpha [Fraternity].
Speaker 2: When I got to Cal [University of California, Berkeley] in 1963 only one half of one percent of the student body was black.  So out of 27,500 students, there were only 135 blacks.  We didn't have enough to create fraternity and sororities.  So what we did was the students from San Francisco State [College; San Francisco State University, San Francisco, California], San Jose State [College; San Jose State University, San Jose, California], Stanford [University, Stanford, California] and Cal, we put our people together and we were able to have Alphas and Kappas [Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity] and Deltas [Delta Sigma Theta Sorority] and so on.  So I had a good social life in the fraternity, but at the same time I don't recall ever sort of really dating per se as in the act of dating.  In fact, we spent more time in our fraternity talking about the revolution.  In fact in our--our fraternity house in San Francisco [California] we did have weapons stored under the beds.
Speaker 1: So you were preparing for the revolution?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) At least intellectually we were preparing for the revolution.  I don't know what we would have done if the shooting started, but we were prepared.
Story_ID: 235685
Speaker 1: Let's talk a little bit about Time magazine when you went to New York [New York] and what was the culture like there during the time we're talking, mid to late '60s [1960s]?
Speaker 2: We're talking mid-'60s [1960s], yes.
Speaker 1: Mid-'60s [1960s], what was the culture like?
Speaker 2: It was wonderful, I mean it's New York City [New York, New York] and New York, and I was new to New York.  I had lived in Long Island [New York] as a real small kid, but being in New York City as, as a nineteen--twenty year old was just really exciting, and again this sort of military training--able to get off an airplane at JFK [John F. Kennedy International Airport, New York, New York], take a cab into New York, find a hotel, and go to work without missing a beat, so I sort of loved it.  I, I loved the big time, I loved talking about sports all the time, I loved hanging out and telling stories, and the people in New York were so much more sophisticated obviously than the people in Rantoul, Illinois or even the people in Berkeley, California, that it was just a different world.  I mean, that was the future and I just had the best, best time.  Now I think I was there at Time Inc. [Time Incorporated], as part of some affirmative action to increase the number of minorities, and, and I'll accept that, but it was just a great experience as an intern, and the fact that after the internship I made enough of an impression, or didn't screw up that they offered me a full-time job was major, and, and I'll always sort of cherish those moments.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 235686
Speaker 1: And what year did you graduate from Berkeley [University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, California]?
Speaker 2: I graduated in '67 [1967] with a bachelor's [degree] in journalistic studies, and what had happened was my sophomore year, the University of California decided to eliminate the journalism department, and so what I was able to do was create my own major, which I called journalistic studies.  I put a history class here, and an English class here, speech class--so I had my own major and called it journalistic studies and that was cool.
Speaker 1: And so let's talk a little bit now about Time magazine, I'm sorry Sports Illustrated; when so you know what, what was your beat and how, how did you go about covering your stories, that kind of thing?
Speaker 2: Well it was great being young, gifted and black in the sports business at that time.  I did some very important work and some less important work.  The most important piece of work I did was research a major series in Sports Illustrated called "The Plight of the Black Athlete" where we really laid out what was a difficult situation for many black athletes.  At the time in which we produced this story, there were quotas, for example, on baseball teams.  If you weren't one of the starting nine, there weren't many blacks who just quote "sat on the bench"--that was reserved for white players.  At the NBA [National Basketball Association] they would never start five black players or no college would start five black players, it'd be three blacks and two whites.  Black players were paid significantly less than their professional counterparts and the college black athletes were really, really exploited.
Speaker 1: How so?
Speaker 2: Just mistreated, called names; there was a football coach at UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California], a man named Tommy Prothro, and as doing part of the research on this story I remember going to him and saying, "Yo, coach why is you refer to your black players as 'Negras'"?  He says, "You know, that's really wrong, and I'm trying to correct myself, so what I do is, and when I'm about to say that word I look down and I put my hand on my knee and I say, 'Negro,' that way I can get away with not having to say that other term."  This was in the late '60s [1960s] of a football coach at UCLA, and that was just the tip.  There were baseball players who were afraid to talk to us who thought they would lose their jobs if they were quoted as saying the system was unfair to them.  About the same time I was able to through my friendship with some young men named Tommie Smith, and Lee Evans and [HistoryMaker] John Carlos who were at San Jose State [College; San Jose State University, San Jose, California], break the story that these athletes, college educated, real smart and real sophisticated said, "We're tired of this, too, so in fact if you don't treat us better we're going to consider boycotting the 1968 [Summer] Olympics [Mexico City, Mexico]," and, in fact, that became a huge, huge story and it was simply more of expression of this sort of discontent with the establishment.  Lew Alcindor [Kareem Abdul-Jabbar] at the time chose in fact to boycott the Olympics and did not go, John Carlos, Tommie Smith, Lee Evans, went, won and raised the fist and made their statement.  I was directly involved with chronicling their story, helping them out.  In fact, the day that Tommie Smith raised his fist, I gave his wife [Denise Smith] and Lee Evans' wife a ride to the stadium down in Mexico City [Mexico].  I mean that's how close we were and how important it was and even after the fact of that when the rest of the media sort of deserted them I remained in contact with them and friends with them because they paid a very, very high price for standing up for the rest of us.
Story_ID: 235687
Speaker 1: What were your thoughts about that, because they did pay a very high price, had that been done at another time the price may not have been the same.  What were your thoughts about that?
Speaker 2: Well part of my thoughts go back to basic Henry David Thoreau and 'Civil Disobedience,' that if you're going to commit civil disobedience you need to expect to have to pay the price.  Now was the price they had to pay fair?  No, it just went on much too long and continues to go on to this day, and unfortunately we in the African American community did not have the wherewithal to support them.  Imagine if that happened today--they would not only be heroes, they would financially set for the rest of their life 'cause we would take care of our icons, but at that it just didn't happen, and Tommie [Smith], the last time I talked to him was coaching a junior college [Santa Monica College, Santa Monica, California] in Southern California, and, and [HistoryMaker] John Carlos I think was in New York somewhere, but no, they made the ultimate sacrifice, they created one of the everlasting images of our time and bless their hearts for doing it, it cost them greatly, but they did it, and again, I like to say that I came from that same time because we were all out there.  Harry Edwards who later became a major player, in helping African Americans fight--African American athletes fight for what we deserved.  He was out there teaching at San Jose State [College; San Jose State University, San Jose, California] at the same time, I mean so we had this whole area of people, and now I as a professional journalist have access, and I'm able to bring their words and help spread the words and the fact is there was a revolution in the sports industry as it pertains to African Americans, and again I didn't have anything to do with it, I helped chronicle it, but at the same time it's, Texas Western [College; University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP), El Paso, Texas] wins the NCAAs [National Collegiate Athletic Association basketball tournament] with five black players, you know, all of a sudden everything is changing, and it continued to change until this day, but at that time Sports Illustrated to its credit devoted numerous pages and great resources to chronicling what in fact was a tragedy, which is the way African American athletes in college and the professional level were being treated.
Speaker 1: And did you have to fight for that story or was that a story where management was receptive to running in?
Speaker 2: Didn't have to fight for it, didn't even suggest it.  There existed this sort of liberal base of great journalists in New York [New York] at that time, that was they did as a matter of course, and, and I--you know and this chronicling the story is certainly not a right reserved for African Americans because numerous white journalists carried the battle for us, but it was people like Dick Schaap and Pete Axthelm who just led the way in terms of correcting these rights, and they spent more telling those stories than reporting who won a game or not.
Story_ID: 235688
Speaker 1: Can you tell us a little bit about Sports Illustrated at the time, like what was the readership and was it the Sports Illustrated that we know today that you know that's--just about on you know on every man's coffee table, and you know a lot of women, too.
Speaker 2: Well yeah, no, it was the powerhouse that it is today, it was however reflective of the time, very few covers had African Americans on it because they believed you put a black person on the cover, people will not buy the publication--they did believe that.  It was a time in which I would often walk into a conversation that would stop because they were telling racial jokes.  It was a time in which most of the college football teams in the South were still all white and half the staff thought that was okay.  So no, it, it was a difficult period, much better now, but no it was not nirvana.
Speaker 1: And were you the, the black reporter who covered like the black stories or did you cover a whole range of things?
Speaker 2: Well that's one of the great things about sports is that they're all black stories so, the only sort of really racial story I did was this, was the research on this major series ["The Plight of the Black Athlete"] that I told you about.  No my beats were track and field, and college basketball.  Now I chose those myself because there were a lot of African Americans in them, and so it was just easier for me but also what I liked was the exchange I was able to have with the athletes themselves.  So I remember covering the New York Knicks and hanging out with Willis Reed and Walt Frazier, not only were we contemporaries in age but it was just sort of good to be with a brother and just have a conversation and sort of have this sort of sense of trust and, and be who you wanted to be.  And so I enjoyed that and, and I thought it was important for the industry also, but yeah, it was great--no, it was truly great and I got to cover a lot of great events.
Speaker 1: And were you able to do what you had always dreamed of, you know, give that story, that African Americans' perspective-- tell it from that black perspective?
Speaker 2: You know my goal was less to do that than tell it from a black perspective or add the black perspective.  My goal was more to position a black me in a position to tell any story I wanted to tell.  That it was more me, the storyteller, than the subject that needed to exist.  So what--yes, the content was important, but one of the reasons I went to Sports Illustrated--because they had the best writers.  I was more interested in becoming a James Baldwin or an Ernest Hemingway so what I liked best about Sports Illustrated is it gave me the ability to write, and writing was what was important to me as opposed to reporting.
Story_ID: 235689
Speaker 1: Yeah, I left Sports Illustrated because the sort of Berkeley [University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, California] in me started to go up. I remember--it was--the day that the Russians [Soviet Union] had invited, invaded one of the, their neighboring countries and no one at Sports Illustrated seemed to care about that and whereas I thought we had done good work at Sports Illustrated I now felt I was more in a position to do more, to help change people's views about not only African Americans but about life in general, about war and peace and about poverty and happiness, and I saw in Newsweek an opportunity to have a broader pallet by which to take paints to paint a good portrait of America.  So when one of my colleagues at Sports Illustrated who was my mentor, a man named Pete Axthelm left to go to Newsweek he went in the sports department, I then joined him at Newsweek, but not in sports.  I became the editor of a section called urban affairs and again it was a period of time which cities were exploding and riots were happening and I was in charge of covering those types of stories.
Speaker 2: Because this was in 1968 and were you there during the assassination of [Reverend] Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.]--had you come yet?
Speaker 1: In '68 [1968] we did Chicago [Illinois] Democratic [National] Convention [DNC], we did the '68 [1968 Summer] Olympics in Mexico City [Mexico] and we did all the assassinations.  It was a tragic year, but a marvelous journalistic year and, yes I contributed to those stories, I didn't lead the coverage of any of those.
Speaker 2: And as the editor of the urban affairs section, what were some of your responsibilities then?
Speaker 1: Well I, I tried to do the other sides of the stories so most of the time the stories I covered were from the point of view of, of the African American citizen, African American business owner, what is our point of view, what do we think is happening in those various areas, but primarily it was you know management they didn't care about what was going on in the inner city in Detroit [Michigan] or the inner city in Chicago.  I covered those stories, I mean why are people angry, why are they rioting?  I tried to help lay out the reasons.
Story_ID: 235690
Speaker 1: What was the culture like at Newsweek?
Speaker 2: Oh--you know and again it goes to New York [New York] and goes to the field of journalism, so all those conservatives who beat up on us and say it's a liberal institution they may be right and it certainly was at the time.  I had a marvelous time at Newsweek because of, of the understanding and, and the bent of the editors.  Katharine Graham owned Newsweek and she set a tone and, ironically enough, I, as an African American, was less discriminated again at Newsweek than were the entire class of women.  There was one day in fact in which I wrote a story, which was heavily, heavily edited, and I think unfairly edited, but it was a group of women who went to complain to the editor in my defense.  I didn't have to go, but it's the women who later sued Newsweek as a class because they weren't getting promoted, they weren't getting the right jobs, they weren't getting paid equally and the women as a class won, so it's this interesting piece of history here where I as an African American male was better off than all those white women were.  It was wrong in both our cases, but eventually the women won their lawsuit and were able to catch up and assume their rightful position, but no, it was a great alliance between we, me, black male writer and the women of Newsweek because we were both mistreated.
Speaker 1: And how many other blacks were there at Newsweek?
Speaker 2: Well there's this marvelous woman named Ruth Ross who helped form Essence, she was there and a person who really helped me through and helped introduce me to people and walk me through.  There was a young man named Ed [Edward A.] Cumberbatch, from the New York bureau who also helped me and, and again that's what great at Sports Illustrated and great at Newsweek.  There were so few of us we did know each other, like each other and spent a lot of time with each other but interestingly enough, even the Ruth Ross conversation where she left Newsweek to help form this magazine, she was ahead of me in, in recognizing the value of African American owned, controlled and targeted media.
Story_ID: 235691
Speaker 1: And so you stayed at Newsweek for how long?
Speaker 2: I stayed at Newsweek until I got drafted.  I'd worked at Newsweek for about a year and half when I got my draft notice and it was September 5th, 1969 and I will always remember that date because I was headed south to Fort Jackson, South Carolina, all of my friends were headed north to Woodstock [Music & Art Fair; Woodstock Festival, Bethel, New York] to have a party and I missed all of Woodstock by having to be in basic training down there in Fort Jackson.
Speaker 1: And what were your experiences like in the [U.S] Army?
Speaker 2: Awful, just awful, I clearly disagreed with our position in [the] Vietnam [War] and even though my father [Marion Rodgers] had been in the [U.S.] military, I didn't think it was right especially I didn't think it was right that so many poor, uneducated people were being drafted and killed.  Yeah, I could have gone to Canada, I could have gone somewhere else, but I chose to stay and live by the law because it was the law that required you to do this.  I remember even thinking about even going to Canada I had created my other persona.  I was going to become Juan Rodriquez [ph.], a citizen of Toronto [Ontario, Canada], but I decided once I got the draft notice that okay, let's do it, let's see what it's about because I had some things in the back of my mind.  One of the things I had in the back of my mind was I had a book contract that if I was sent to Vietnam I had worked it out with an agent and a publisher that I was going to chronicle my stay there and do a book, and so that seemed like a great opportunity, a journalistic opportunity so I wasn't going to fight it that much.  Now I may have been dead and never been able to write the book, but at least I knew I had that.  And the other side of that was I said, "I think there's probably a way through this and let me see if I could work this."  So, what the way was I figured was: I had to obey the law, but what I never had to do was to sign an oath or swear allegiance and what I primarily objected to in the military was the fact that if you disobeyed the order of an officer you could be sent to the stockade.  So if the officer said or anybody said, "We're going to send you Vietnam" and you said "I don't want to go" you're guilty.  If the officer said, "Once you're in Vietnam I want you to go burn that village," you had to go burn the village or else you're guilty.  Now how do they get this authority?  In my sense of logic they got this authority because you gave them that right, by once you are in the Army you sign this thing, this Oath of Allegiance and within that oath you agree to follow the orders and live by the Military Code of Justice [sic. Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ)], but you didn't have to sign that.  So I went--when I got drafted, I went to where I had to go because that was the law.  What wasn't the law was I didn't have to sign my rights away and I chose not to sign my rights away.  So here we are down here at Whitehall Street [New York, New York] where all these people from New York get drafted and they--you go through the thing and you pass the physical and do all this other--and I'm so stupid here that I could've screwed up the test or something and they said he's too dumb to go.  No, I wanted to ace the test so they you know, this guy let's get him, and so they get to me and I said I'm not going to do the oath because I don't want to have to follow your orders 'cause I don't trust you and I don't value--what you have to say.
Story_ID: 235692
Speaker 1: So here I am, in the [U.S.] Army, by the law but not agreeing to follow their rules.  They said, "Ok troop, we'll send you off."  So they sent me down to Fort Jackson [South Carolina] and then I got--I get called in and I remember the sergeant looking at my record and said, "How come you won't sign this Oath of Allegiance?"  And I said, "Because I don't want to give away my rights because, especially in light of what's going on in [the] Vietnam [War] I think that's wrong and I think that's illegal.  I'm here because it's the law, but I'm not going to give away my rights, I'm not going to give away my soul," and I remember the sergeant looking down at my records, "oh, I see you went to Berkeley [University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, California] that's why you're like you are.  That's why you got an attitude problem," but at the same time the Army's not talking to the Army because the other side of the people who are looking at your records--I next get called over to a lieutenant who says, "Oh, we're looking at your test scores--we want you to be in military intelligence, come to this meeting."  I said, ok cool.  And I get called to this meeting and you walk into this room--in like a little theater and it's a room full of mostly white people and they're going to do the intelligence briefing about why you're going to be in military intelligence, and the guy gets up and he stands like this, "Is there a [HistoryMaker] Private [Johnathan] Rodgers here?"  I wave my hand and he says, "We can't even start this meeting until you leave the room," (laughter), so I said, "Okay cool."  So I leave the room; so you know I don't get in military intelligence, they don't know what to do with me, but I know how to play the game.  So I go through basic training and I finish first in shooting and first in marching and first in military history, so I got all the things.  They don't know what to do with me, and again the right hand started telling the left hand what's going on.  So again, I'm following the law, so I get a call--I mean my orders come in, they do want to send me to Vietnam, but they want to send me as a (unclear) which is an operating room technician.  I also grew up on 'M*A*S*H' and said, "Oh, this is cool," you know, "I get to sit in the operating room," and I don't like blood anyway but, but it was a job that I felt was worthwhile.  I would be of value but then the left hand kept saying to the right hand and said, "No" you can't even do that because, you know, you won't sign the Oath of Allegiance and we don't know if we can trust you.  So my Army existence for my first year was to stay in a barracks in Fort Jackson, South Carolina by myself while they decided what they wanted to do with me given the sort of dichotomies I had thrown at them, 'cause I wasn't breaking the law and I wasn't violating any rules.  So I got some friends of mine from New York and we bought a bookstore in Columbia, South Carolina.  So-- a good portion of my Army stay I ran a bookstore in Five Points, in Columbia, South Carolina.  Then finally I do get orders later and they send me to Korea, not Vietnam so that's good, it's Korea and my job in Korea was--I was, and thank god for stereotypes in this case I became the coach of the basketball team, so again, yeah hey, you're black you must know basketball you be the coach, cool and I was the coach.
Story_ID: 237581
Speaker 1: With your experiences in the [U.S.] Army did you experience any racism or did any racial incidents occur?
Speaker 2: Interestingly enough during this period of time in which I was in this barracks alone in Fort Jackson [South Carolina] they did do a, a check on me, they--I mean they sent out the military investigators or whoever they do to go to your friends and relatives and people who knew you to ask about your character, and, of course, I would get these references until they went to my friend Pete Axthelm from, from Newsweek and Pete was among the most liberal of liberal whites ever, and so they say to Pete: "So, Pete, does this [HistoryMaker Johnathan] Rodgers believe in America?"  And Pete says, "Of course he believes in America--black America," (laughter).  So to hear this bald headed white guy saying that to them I think it just knocked the investigator off his seat and I think I had two months in South--Fort Jackson, South Carolina but it was fine (laughter).
Speaker 1: And in terms of your Army experience were, were you feeling like your journalistic career was kinda being stifled or were there other things that you were doing to stay on top of your writing skills and that kinda thing?
Speaker 2: Well there wasn't anything I was doing to stay on top of my writing skills, but I was doing a lot to stay on top of my communication skills, and just develop these marvelous friendships with these other African Americans, and these were African Americans I might not likely meet, I mean they're people from the South or people who were blue collar workers or, or at--and so it was more the knowledge of, of the full breadth and depth of our culture and society that I found most fascinating and, and just this sort of being eight thousand miles away and just seeing, you know, another black person in a village in Korea and there's this connection and you sort of fill this identity.  That was just really, really important to me, and so, you know, everybody always complains about the [U.S.] military but in fact those were some our best days.
Speaker 1: And when you left the military in 1971--
Speaker 2: Yeah, the military has this great thing or at least during that time that you could leave early, you know when you're drafted you're going for twenty-four months, but you can leave after eighteen months if you were going to be a teacher or going back to graduate--going to graduate school or you were a farmer.  And no way was I going to be a farmer, and no way I was going to be a teacher, so I decided to apply to graduate school, so I wrote a letter to Stanford [University, Stanford, California] and to Berkeley [University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, California], applied to graduate school.  I remember taking my graduate record exam [GRE] in Seoul, [South] Korea in a roomful of Koreans, and obviously I did well enough that I got accepted by both Stanford and Berkeley.  Stanford being a private institution offered more money, and so I was able to leave the Army after eighteen months to go to graduate school at Stanford.  Now of those eighteen months the vast majority was spent in Fort Jackson, South Carolina doing nothing.
Story_ID: 237582
Speaker 1: What were your experiences like at Stanford [University, Stanford, California]?
Speaker 2: It was heaven; Stanford was then and continues to be the most wonderful place in the world.  It's a world that isn't in fact real.  At Stanford are all these relatively privileged individuals in Stanford's case, black, white and brown.  When I got to Stanford there was a black dorm and in front of this black dorm were all these Datsun 240Zs and these Jags [Jaguar] and these Benzes [Mercedes Benz].  I mean it was the first time I had sort of met the upper crust of African American society, and I loved it (laughter).  I loved it.  I mean these were people who were intellectually stimulating, who were physically attractive, who had seen and done a lot of things, and you knew were going to end up running things.  So my whole experience at Berkeley [University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, California] where I was shocked that someone would actually want to run something and plan their life to do that way, fast forward eight years later at Stanford where it was every black person there who was going to run something and own something and do very, very well because they had not seen or been taught anything differently than that and there exists this world of the entitled and I know a lot of white people think they're entitled just because they're white.  At Stanford I met the entitled blacks and they deserved to be entitled.
Speaker 1: And what were you thinking that you wanted to get a graduate degree, but what were you thinking that you wanted to do with this graduate degree?
Speaker 2: The main reason I went back to graduate school was that I had realized that the best way for me to fulfill my dreams of communicating with as many people as possible was in fact not through print, but through television.
Speaker 1: Because you could just reach so many more people (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, and even though I had written cover stories for Sports Illustrated and cover stories for Newsweek I knew every time I'd apply to a television station they were going to say to me, "Well, young man why don't you go start in Biloxi, Mississippi or why don't you go start in Ames, Iowa," and I didn't want to do that.  I'd seen the big time, so I figured if I went to Stanford and I got a degree in filmmaking, I would have made the translation from print to visual and therefore every network in the world ought to be dying for me.  So I went to film school at Stanford and had a marvelous year and a half.
Story_ID: 237583
Speaker 1: This was a time to--we're talking about mid-'70s [1970s] now?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: When we were starting to see more African Americans on the air in terms of television news.  So were you feeling confident that this was going to be a great opportunity for you to land that job in, you know, a medium-sized type market?
Speaker 2: Well you know what I feared was the tokenism that continues to exist until today and that--and, I hated this in me but I'd look at a television station.  If they had one black male and one black female I knew I wasn't, I didn't have a shot 'cause that's all they wanted was one black male and one black female.  So that bothered me, the fact that we existed in the medium didn't mean the medium was open to us.  So, yeah, I, I pursued it.  Fortunately it turned out that I was not that good on television, so I didn't have to force myself into being that one black male reporter.  In fact what I forced myself into an area in which there were very--even fewer of us, which was production and management, but even more importantly to me was, in fact, reporters have no real authority.  They have a lot of fame, but all they're really responsible for is about ninety seconds of a broadcast.  Hey, that producer's responsible for an hour of that broadcast, but a management person is responsible for hiring that producer and hiring that reporter and deciding what goes in that show.  So I quickly discovered in this business where the real power was.  It didn't matter to me that we weren't there in great numbers. I was just going to be there, and so I quickly decided once I did get into the television business, that what I wanted to do was control a portion of it.
Story_ID: 237584
Speaker 1: Could you kind of explain a little bit just how TV works and how a lot of times reporters don't make the decisions about what stories they cover and that kind of thing.  Those decisions are made in management meetings and you know with assignment editors and that kind of thing.  So can you kind of talk a little bit about that?
Speaker 2: Sure, a television reporter, normally when a television reporter gets to work they're told what their story for the day is.  Oftentimes they're handed a packet of research and all they have time to do is get in the car with a crew.  Go out and shoot the story, put themselves in the story and come back and put it together.  That's sort of unfair but that's the reality of their business. The real authority is deciding what stories you're actually going to put on the air.  Those decisions are made by producers and assignment editors who are management people, and that was the situation in the '60s [1960s] and the '70s [1970s] and even the '80s [1980s] where you'd always end up--the only black images you saw were of criminals, because these guys didn't know that there were black stockbrokers they could talk to.  They didn't know that there were white welfare people they could talk to and so it just distorted the medium.  It sent out the wrong images, but as we passed, more and more African Americans got into management and into production.  You know, I, I hate the fact that I was the first black news director at, at a network station.  I hate the fact that I was the first black general manager at a network station and I'm quite--and the first time I was a black president of a station's division, but I'm so pleased to say that it's, it's the norm now.  There are numerous black news directors and numerous black general managers.  There're so few station division I don't know where we are there, but the fact is we have made great progress and the fact is we all--we the society have all benefitted from that we see more fair images on the television screen these days.
Story_ID: 237585
Speaker 1: You get your degree from--your master's degree from Stanford [University, Stanford, California] and what do you do next?
Speaker 2: Oh, I go back to New York [New York] and get a job at NBC [WNBC-TV, New York, New York], NBC as a writer, and this is also a new lesson for me.  I get a job at NBC because there's a black man who's the assistant news director, a man named Bob Reid who is doing the hiring, and Bob Reid is also one of the founders of the National Association of Black Journalists [NABJ], and he does the right thing.  Now, is it going to hurt him hiring me?  Absolutely not, but would another person have hired me?  I don't think so.  Bob Reid was willing to do that, and so I have taken Bob Reid's teachings and tried to pass them on as much as I can.  So I started off at NBC as a writer, then became a producer and, like most television people, I still had this sort of feeling in me that I'd be a great TV star, just give me a mic, and give me a camera and hey, call me Geraldo Rivera, I'm going to take over the world. And so NBC did give me the opportunity to be in front of the camera and I went to the NBC operation [WKYC] in Cleveland [Ohio].
Speaker 1: And could you just explain really quickly the difference between an affiliate and network?  You went to as a write-in producer for the network?
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: Could you just explain really quickly the difference?
Speaker 2: Yeah, in the '70s [1970s] each television network was allowed to own five television stations.  NBC owned a station in New York and I went to work for that station initially.  When I wanted to be on the air, NBC sent me to the station they owned in Cleveland, and both of the news operations at that time were controlled by NBC News, so it was the NBC News connection, and when I got to Cleveland and was on the air, two major lessons: one, I found out I was only responsible for my ninety seconds, and so if I hated everything else that was going on around me, I couldn't say or do anything.  I'd just have to do my one story the best way possible.  And then the other thing I discovered was I wasn't any good (laughter).  That there were people who were ten million times better than I was and they were naturals, I mean there are people who are born who are just really good on TV.  I, unfortunately, was not one of them.  And so add those two factors to what I later discovered was once you're on TV, people know who you are, and they think they own you.  I'm too private a person to have people in the street stop me and want to talk about my life or people I know or what I'm doing.  My wife [Royal Kennedy] who is on the air and is real good on the air tells the story about a woman who followed her into a dressing room in a department store and said to her friend, "See, I told you that was Royal, I told you that was Royal".  I don't give up my privacy like that and I didn't like being a public figure.  So all those factors sort of went into me trying to make a decision as to what I really wanted to do and what I really wanted to do was have control over this medium.
Story_ID: 237586
Speaker 1: What year did you go to NBC [WNBC-TV] as a writer and producer in New York [New York]?
Speaker 2: I think it may have been '73 [1973], yeah it was during the Watergate summer.
Speaker 1: Okay, and then you went to Cleveland [Ohio]--
Speaker 2: Probably that next year.
Speaker 1: Nineteen seventy-four [1974] and what was the--were the call letters at the station in Cleveland?
Speaker 2: WKYC.
Speaker 1: And how were you received in Cleveland?
Speaker 2: Oh, well, it's just interesting enough how was I received in Cleveland. I think I may have been a little too New York for a lot of Cleveland because I was cool, I mean I dressed like a New Yorker, I had a New Yorker's attitude.  Nothing was good enough for me 'cause I had been in New York.  So, I don't know how I was accepted but was worse I was a--not only how they accepted me, how did I accept Cleveland.  I passed through Cleveland and that wasn't good for me or for Cleveland.  I didn't think Cleveland was the place for me, nor was it the place I wanted to spend my career.  So I went in, spent one winter and said I will never spend another winter and didn't.
Speaker 1: And so from Cleveland you went to Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 2: Well yeah, and that's where the story sort of becomes interesting.  So I go to Cleveland, yes to be on the air, but I really go to Cleveland because I'd met this wonderful woman named Royal Kennedy, and Royal Kennedy was a reporter at WKYC in Cleveland.  It turns out she was beautiful, she was African American and her father [Lieutenant James Kennedy] was also a Tuskegee Airman.  I had lived on the same block with her in Long Island, New York when we were both like two years old, three years old.  We had lived on the same street in Okinawa [Island, Japan] at different times but it was the exact same street.  Our parents knew each other, and Royal was this reporter at WKYC in Cleveland, and I had an opportunity to go there.  At the same time I had an opportunity to go join The New York Times as a writer, and I accepted the job at The New York Times but then I met Royal and one of the more difficult decisions for me was to go to The New York Times and decline a job I had accepted, and I couldn't tell The New York Times I declined the job because I'd fallen in love and wanted to follow this woman to Cleveland.  So I said, "I just think television isn't in my future."  So I go to Cleveland, Royal's there and I'm this reporter.  So it's okay, now do I like the winter, no, but am I willing to stay there 'cause Royal's there?  Yes.  What happens?  Royal gets promoted, she gets transferred to NBC [WMAQ-TV, Chicago, Illinois] in Chicago, and, and so here I am I'm going to be in Cleveland in the winter and Royal's not there after I've moved there for you, Royal.
Story_ID: 237587
Speaker 1: So what I do before she [Royal Kennedy] leaves [Cleveland, Ohio for Chicago, Illinois] is I propose to her on television, and she accepts on television.  She's going to kill me later she says, but she accepts on television, so now I know I got her locked up.  So I feel a little easier, and then she goes and says to her news director in Chicago [Illinois], "I'm engaged, I'm going to marry this man who's really good on television, can you hire him so he can be a reporter here in Chicago here so he can move to the city?"  And the news director said, "You know, I wish I could but I promised our next opening to this writer we have here, this guy named Pat O'Brien." And so--
Speaker 2: The Pat O'Brien (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) It turns out to be Pat O'Brien who ends up on 'Access Hollywood' and all these other shows and who's a dear friend of ours and so there's no job for me in Chicago, hey, but I'm cool.  I said, "I don't care, I quit."  So I moved to Chicago simply to marry Royal without a job. And I didn't find a job for a full eight months, and bless Royal's heart she tolerated this all, because if you've ever been around television crews or some black men who hear that a woman is living with a man who doesn't have a job, they make it hard on the woman, and she'd come home with these messages from people saying, "Oh, so and so tried to tell you they have a janitor's job open at so and so or they have this job opened here or they have this job opened here," so bless her heart, she was able to hold them all off, maintain her dignity while eventually I, I ended up with another job.  In fact the job that set me off on the path that I am currently on.
Speaker 2: And so that job was at WBBM[-TV, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 1: It was at WBBM and I was in management for the first time in my life.  I was the assistant news director. I had the ability to hire people, fire people, schedule people, make decisions about programs, and money being spent and budgets.  I was in management, and I was really, really happy.
Story_ID: 237588
Speaker 1: Can you kinda talk a little bit about how you made this transition from on-air to management, what was it about you at WBBM[-TV, Chicago, Illinois] that made them give--that helped you know get this opportunity to become the assistant news director of a television station in a major market?
Speaker 2: Well, in this case it was the openness and the intelligence of the news director who was a bright young kid just out of Yale [University, New Haven, Connecticut] and out of public broadcasting who was sort of mean.  He was really the bad cop and he needed a good cop, and I'm a real good, good cop.  So in fact my reputation would be--people would come to my wife [Royal Kennedy] and say, "Oh, your husband just fired me but he was so nice when he did it," (laughter), so I was the good cop and, and the two of us worked well together and, and we helped the organization grow, but again based on my background at the time, based on the things that I'd done and the education I had had, there was no reason why I could not be the assistant news director and that was always been--one of my philosophies was never put myself in a position where some executive or some hiring person could say to me, "Well, you know only if you would had a master's [degree] from Stanford [University, Stanford, California] we would of hired you, only if you had been a reporter on-air we would have hired you.  If only you had written for a magazine we would've hired you."  I tried to do everything in order to eliminate that excuse from somebody.  I don't want to give them an easy out.  You don't want to hire, don't hire me, if you don't want to hire me because I'm black, don't hire 'cause I'm black.  I'm not going to let you not hire because you think I don't have some qualification.
Speaker 1: And how did you make the transition from on-air to management, how did you deal with the transition?
Speaker 2: Oh, it was easy because again, it is the essence to me of a good manager is someone who cares about his people about his employees, and so if you take care of their well-being, they will take care of you professionally.  And I've always found out the employees give you back tenfold what you give to them.  It was real easy because again, just bringing sort of basic humanity, bringing basic logic and treat people well.
Story_ID: 237589
Speaker 1: News is a little different in the sense that you have ratings, and you could have a very good reporter who--main, or anchor who may not be pulling in the ratings and it's just so competitive, so how did you deal with sometimes, you know, having to let someone go because the ratings weren't that great, that kind of thing and can you also talk a little about ratings and how all that works?
Speaker 2: Yeah, ratings in fact is the life blood of television because in order to do these things we have to pay for them and we have to get advertiser money and an advertiser won't give you money unless they know how many people are watching.  Unfortunately ratings are also important in television news, both from a competitive point of view, but from a revenue point of view as well, and if you don't have the ratings you have to change something.  You can change the management, you can change the sets, you can change the anchor person, you can change the reporters.  Rarely does an individual reporter have a major impact on ratings, so I don't recall ever having to let go at a reporter because they didn't contribute to the ratings.  Reporters contribute to the essence and the feel of the entire broadcast.  The answer is yes; I have hired and let go anchors and anchors of color because the ratings weren't there, so ratings are part of the requirement of the job.  What is your job as anchor person to do, to communicate effectively to the audience what the news is and to attract enough of them in order to make a success.  If you can't do the second part, I have no use for you even if you are black.
Story_ID: 237590
Speaker 1: As assistant news director [at WBBM-TV, Chicago, Illinois], what were you thinking in terms of your career goals?  Were you thinking you know, I really want to move into programming or some other aspects, or were you happy with news?
Speaker 2: I was happy with news because I was still in the mood to change news, to, to make news more objective, to make it more fair; because again even in the '80s [1980s] and the '90s [1990s] the portrayal of African Americans on television news was highly negative, and we could have--and one of the great ironies is we put people like Lester Holt on the news and rather than saying to the audience, "Let's look at African Americans differently," all it said to the white audience and the research shows this is, "oh, he's not like the rest of them," and so that battle just keeps going on and on.  So it wasn't who you put on there, it was what you covered and how you covered it which was most important.  So you build up the institutions, you build up the leaders, you show African Americans in these sort of positive roles doing positive things.  And yeah, we do the crime and you do those sorts of stories.  Unfortunately in local television news, crime and those types of stories are just too important because they do sell the tickets and all too often we're involved in those stories.
Speaker 1: And, but a lot of is about balance, though, so you know you have to cover the story where you have these criminals who are African American, but in terms of balance, you know, you show, you know, African American lawyers and African Americana psychologists who are talking about why there's a crime epidemic in the inner city, that kind of thing.  What are some of your thoughts about that?
Speaker 2: Oh no, that's exactly what you do and again, it is--you show the white woman with food stamps as often as you show the black stock broker advising you on what to do in your mutual funds.  You have to show the full breadth, and later in my career when I ended up running the CBS-owned television stations, one of the great things about that was where the stations were located: L.A. [Los Angeles, California], Chicago [Illinois], Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], New York [New York] and Miami [Florida].  I had more Hispanics and blacks watching us than I had whites watching us, and so for me it was like being in heaven.  So, clearly, if you had an anchor team that reflected its community, they were doing my work.  If they covered the news and had stories that were really of interest to the community, that's exactly where I wanted them to be, and, and that's why I think local television sources--television stations are so important in communicating with the local community and why they really should reflect the community and that's what I tried to do at all the CBS stations.  It's a little harder to do it in news per se, but essentially enough, if you have a black producer or a black news director or a black general manager, all of a sudden you find the employees on their own sort of think of this, that it's sort of in their mind, it's not in the back of their mind any more it's in the fore of their mind and that they take great pride in having discovered the black pediatrician who's now going to be your child specialist, that they have found the black educator who's going to do this segment, and, and so that's where we're making the progress.  So you can't now say, "He's not like the rest of them," because it's he, and it's she and it's them, and it's us.
Story_ID: 237591
Speaker 1: I've been going to the National Association of Black Journalists [NABJ] for more years than I can remember, and I'm not embarrassed to admit that I love it as much socially as I love it educationally and professionally.  We need to get together; we need to share social time and information time with each other.  We need to be able to put our arms around each other and sort of do this battle together and institutions like that, and thank God for the Bob Reids and the Vernon Jarretts [HistoryMaker Vernon Jarrett] of the world are just crucially important to all of us to live.  Interestingly enough in a lot of aspects of our culture we have arrived, I don't think we've arrived yet in journalism.
Speaker 2: And in terms of NABJ for a lot of African American reporters in many places, even still today that I'm sure back in the '70s [1970s] and '80s [1980s] they were still in many places the only African American, not just in, you know, on-air, but in the entire news department and perhaps sometimes even at the entire station, so that, that was another great benefit of NABJ to come together and see others who were doing the same things that you were doing.
Speaker 1: Oh and absolutely and, and it's the networking and the job exchanges and as an employer I'm pleased to say from Discovery [Networks U.S.] to CBS, we've always been major sponsors to NABJ and we've always managed to hire a number of individuals we meet at the convention.
Story_ID: 237592
Speaker 1: So after assistant news director at BBM [WBBM-TV, Chicago, Illinois], what did you do next?
Speaker 2: Then I went to Los Angeles [California] to become the executive producer for the USA's very first two and a half hour local news--evening news broadcast.  We sort of introduced long-form news casting to the world (laughter) so shame on us I guess, and so I went back into production and I love production and to be able to sort of sit up on, at this desk and sort of cover the stories and cover the riots and cover the floods and, and to cover city council and, and to, to sit down with [Mayor] Tom Bradley and all these sorts of people, that was probably the best--the best jobs I've ever had has been executive producer at KCBS[-TV, Los Angeles, California] in Los Angeles and executive producer at CBS News because of the ability you have to just order up a story and it appears by the end of the day.  It is--that is the marvels of this business.
Speaker 1: And what year was that when you went to KCBS?
Speaker 2: Nineteen seventy-eight [1978].
Speaker 1: And what was the climate like at KCBS in the late '80s [1980s]?
Speaker 2: Hey, life in the fast lane (laughter), it was, you know, I mean all of a sudden now you know we're though with the [Vietnam] War, the sort of Civil Rights Movement is over--we're in the '80s [1980s].  We're in the world of take care of yourself, and it was fun, fun, fun.
Speaker 1: Were you hesitant at all thinking, this is way too much information for people, you know, no way, you know, people are going to be able to tolerate this much news?
Speaker 2: No because you know the knowledge is that people never watch anything all the way through and the most people watch local news for about seven minutes and then tune out, so now you just sort of create the program and you create a wheel by which people tuning in can get what they need to do, but no, it was the sense of the time, you know, that one, television news was so important and it really was important.  We have plenty of things to tell because there was plenty of money, advertising dollars to support it and better that than some trashy sitcom or some other program, and it also gave an opportunity for a number of journalists, a number of individuals to get on the air that wouldn't happen in this (unclear) of thing where it's got your one white male and your white female and that's all the room, because we got like three, or four or five anchor teams.
Speaker 1: And can you kind of tell us a little about how the long format, the long-news format worked back then in the early stages, early days?
Speaker 2: Yeah, interestingly enough it works sort of like talk radio works.  There'd be a news break and essentially the rest are interviews and talks and features, but we would do a half-hour show, then we'd do an hour show, and then another hour show and obviously you have to repeat the news of the day, but it was, and then at the same time the NBC and the ABC station were doing three hours of news.  So there was just plenty of work for a lot of people and I think coming out of that system we trained a lot of technicians and trained a lot of journalists.
Story_ID: 237593
Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] Mr. [Johnathan] Rodgers we, we left off when you left to go to KCBS[-TV, Los Angeles, California], and we were talking a little bit about this, the long-news format and can you just kinda share with us how successful it was in the beginning?  Were people buying it?
Speaker 2: Well what was happening in the '70s [1970s] and the '80s [1980s] was that there was this great appetite for news because there was so much going on, and news radio had become very, very popular, so our general manager at the time, a man named Van Gordon Sauter came from radio and wanted to see if we could do on television what was successful on radio, so we created these long-form newscasts.  It turned out that they were quite successful, and after we introduced ours, so, too did, the ABC station and the NBC station and until this date three-hour early afternoon newscasts are a regular affair on television in Los Angeles [California].
Speaker 1: What were some of the problems with it?
Speaker 2: Finding enough news to put in especially in a place like Los Angeles.  You know there isn't that much going on and what is going on most people aren't interested in.  For example, and it always bothered me, people in Southern California have no interest in state government, so we didn't need to send anybody in Sacramento [California] 'cause people didn't care.  What they were interested in was traffic and so we had a lot of traffic, we'd have helicopters, but some of the more interesting days for me were the days we'd cover the brush fires or the landslides because that was, to us, real news, but in Los Angeles if it was raining that was the lead story because so rarely did it rain and when it did rain people did not know how to drive.
Speaker 1: What about the danger of people kind of ODing [over dosing] on the set, it would just be way too much for people to handle, what are some of your thoughts about that?
Speaker 2: Well at this time we also knew that people never really joined you at the beginning of a news broadcast and stayed until the end, that they would go in and out of the newscast, so essentially what the long-form newscast allowed us to do was essentially to create a news wheel, so if you tuned in at 4:30 or your tuned in at 5:15 or 6:15, you could still get the full copy of the news without having to watch the entire broadcast.  We did not expect many people, if any, to watch the entire two and half hours of early news.
Speaker 1: Was it expensive?
Speaker 2: Everything cost a lot but the fact is, because we repeated a certain amount of the news, it was quite economical.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 237594
Speaker 1: After executive producer, what was next for you at, with CBS?
Speaker 2: Well I became the news director at KCBS[-TV] in Los Angeles [California] and then shortly thereafter became the station manager, and that was about the time I was going through my transition from news to sort of general managership.  I had learned all I believed that there was to learn about news and I was really fascinated by programming and sales, so fortunately I was able to be promoted to station manager there and later to general manager of the CBS station [WBBM-TV] in Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 1: And let's go back to L.A. [Los Angeles, California] for a second, and what were some of your accomplishments as station manager?
Speaker 2: Oh, I, I don't know, we, we won a lot of awards, I thought we covered the news better than anybody else, but I think one of the things I'm most proud of was the diversity we displayed of the people who were on the news.  I mean people used to joke about us and refer to us as the "Third World News Broadcast," and that was okay with me.  I mean we had an, a Chinese American woman, we had an African American sportscaster, we had a Mexican American weathercaster, yeah, we were third world news, but so was Los Angeles, so it just worked really well and having long-form news allowed us to have many people front the news and we clearly had diversity and I'm, really, really pleased with that.
Speaker 1: And how were you doing in terms of your transition, were, were you liking this other aspect of TV?
Speaker 2: Oh, I loved it.  You know I like control, you know when I was a reporter I liked the fact that I controlled my ninety seconds, but that wasn't enough, so I became a producer.  Then I liked the fact that I controlled sixty minutes, but that wasn't enough, so then I became a news director and controlled all the news, but three hours wasn't enough either.  To have twenty-four seven responsibility for a television station that means a lot to its local community was really what I wanted to do, and I fell right into it.
Story_ID: 237595
Speaker 1: And so you go back to Chicago [Illinois] and what year is this when you go back to Chicago?
Speaker 2: Well in-between Los Angeles [California] and Chicago I took a detour back to CBS News in New York [New York] where I became an executive producer.  I became an executive producer of CBS's first overnight newscast.  So I think they saw in my ability to produce long-form newscasts locally, then I might be able to do the same nationally.  So as executive producer of a program called ['CBS News] Nightwatch' ['CBS Overnight News'] we were on the air live from 2:00 A.M. to 6:00 A.M. five days a week and, talk about real pleasure, I controlled four hours of network time.  Now again, it was in the middle of the night, we did news, but we did news and entertainment, and I remember sitting in the control room one night, about 3:00 A.M., East Coast time, and I pick up the phone and there's a voice that I recognize, and it turns out it was in fact Sammy Davis, Jr., who said, "Yeah, man, I like what you're doing.  I watch it all time," but that's the type of people who watch 'Night Watch,' it was people who worked in maternity wards, it was nursing mothers, it was entertainers, it was night shift workers, but we created this sort of unique cult among this late night news program.
Speaker 1: And what happened with 'Nightwatch'?
Speaker 2: Well 'Nightwatch' existed for quite a while, I, after less than a year, moved on and they put me in charge of the weekend newscast ['CBS Evening News,' weekend edition], so I went from nights to weekends, which were better I will tell you, because when I did 'Nightwatch' I worked one of those awful sort of two-shift days.  I would work from 10:00 A.M. to 2:00 P.M. and then from 10:00 P.M. to 6:00 A.M., so it was really, I think, hurting me physically.  Fortunately my, my son [David Rodgers] was very young, and, and (laughter), I don't know if he could understand it or not but when the school teacher says, "What does your daddy do"?  He says, "Sleep," (laughter), 'cause that's all I really I had time to do when I saw him, but then I moved to the weekend news.  Good news there was I had two weekdays off and I was able to sort of regain my life, bad news was I worked on weekends, but that's okay because there were great news stories on the weekends and I was working with people like Charles Osgood and Bob Schieffer, and it just was wonderful television, and that's where I got my first sort of television executive ribbon because Charles Osgood we got him and he was coming from radio and he really wasn't that good on television, but he was a great hit on radio and, and I remember talking to him and saying, "You know, we need to find a way to signal to the audience that you're not the typical sort of blow-dried anchorman, that they shouldn't expect from you perfect diction and deep voice," and so what we decided to do was that if he wore his bow tie, it would say, "Hey, this guy's unique and he's unusual," and to this date Charlie gives me credit for having him wear a bow tie which he wears to this date.
Story_ID: 237596
Speaker 1: What were some of the differences that you were seeing with network news versus local news?
Speaker 2: Well the biggest difference was--we covered the world and we had the resources to do it.  I remember coming in one morning where there had been this awful bombing at a barracks in Beirut [Lebanon] where hundreds of Americans had died.  It was my responsibility to carry that news to the American public.  I felt like I had a real job, in fact, it was a real job.  I brought the world's news to the citizens of the United States three times a weekend, and, and it was quite rewarding.
Speaker 1: And how was it being back in New York [New York] again, were you kind of got your start in journalism?
Speaker 2: Right, well I love New York, 'cause I love New York's energy and I loved being at the headquarters [of CBS News].  So I was quite excited about it and, you know, I still had friends there, and me and the family we had a wonderful time.
Speaker 1: And so from there you go back to Chicago [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: No, before that there was one more stop, and, and that stop was--again, remember I've worked the night shift, I've worked the weekend shift, so what other?
Speaker 1: Morning.
Speaker 2: You got it (laughter), I became the executive producer of the 'CBS Morning News.'  My anchors were Maria Shriver and Forrest Sawyer and we got--at one point we were number two in the ratings and for the 'CBS Morning News' that was quite rare and we were quite pleased and we've always felt we deserved that. And as executive producer of the 'Morning News,' I remember once, and you know how these morning shows travel, we decided to go to Florida, to Miami [Florida] and it was going to be a wild, wild week and I remember the first day we get there, we're shooting from the Fontainebleau [Miami Beach, Miami Beach, Florida] hotel and the musical guest is the Miami Sound Machine, featuring Gloria Estefan.  Now they weren't known, but we just put them on the air and it was just great television.  So Monday, great, we're hot, hot, hot.  I go to bed that Monday night to be wakened up early the next morning by someone saying, "The Challenger has crashed," the space shuttle.  So we just moved from Miami up to Cape Canaveral [Florida] or Cape Kennedy [John F. Kennedy Space Center, Florida] and covered the story and it became a news story. So again, news is what's in our blood and we covered that news story and, and you know it was sad but there was a period, I mean you know where we could've gone to the right or could've gone to the left and we stuck with the news, but for those moments in which we did news plus, it was quite rewarding.
Story_ID: 237597
Speaker 1: But I only did that job [executive producer of 'CBS Morning News'] for about four months because what was happening in Chicago [Illinois] at the time was that [HistoryMaker Reverend] Jesse [L.] Jackson and Operation PUSH [Rainbow PUSH Coalition] had staged a protest against the CBS-owned station in Chicago, WBBM Television [WBBM-TV, Chicago, Illinois] and it was over--the public issue was that the CBS station had terminated a long-time African American anchorman, a man named [HistoryMaker] Harry Porterfield.  So the station was under siege, and the protestors had a long list of demands, and among the demands was, we wanted blacks in management, we want blacks on the air, we want blacks here, we want blacks there.  CBS is a major corporation and sort of doesn't like to react to that type of protest, but interestingly enough, the current general manager of that station died, and he died of cancer, so there clearly was a vacancy there.  CBS was smart enough to say to me, "Hey, how'd you like to go to Chicago?"  And I said, "Love to," and so I get to Chicago, but I arrive to Chicago and I'm thinking, oh, my friend Jesse's going to stop protesting, now we got me here, unh-uh.  Jesse kept going for about six months because again, he had a long list of demands, many of those demands were, were quite worthwhile, so working with Jesse and Operation PUSH over the next six months, we eventually reached a point where we can resolve all the issues, and the protest ended and the boycott ended, and I remember celebrating with the Reverend Jackson at a Saturday morning Operation PUSH meeting, and he said the nicest thing about me to his, to the congregation.  He said, you know, "Jackie Robinson was ready for the major leagues before they called him up, well here's another J.R. [HistoryMaker Johnathan Rodgers] who is ready for this current job before they called him up," and then he introduced me, and I'll always remember that from him.
Speaker 2: Now, how were you received by some of your white colleagues at BBM?  Did anyone feel like, wow, great he gets this job because Jesse Jackson's protesting and they need to hire a black person?
Speaker 1: You know, my guess is the vast majority of them thought that, didn't bother me, but I don't let things like that bother me, and--but I wouldn't have made it had it not been for the support of the African Americans on the staff: the editors, the cameramen, the writers, who did it in the right way.  I mean, you know those were interesting times, I mean I became you know, not only was I the first African American news director at any of these of owned and operated stations, I was the first African American general manager at any of these owned and operated stations. I mean CBS, ABC and NBC, they just didn't do it so, yeah, they may have objected, but it didn't bother me (laughter).  One of the great ironies was that the NBC station in Chicago had a Cuban American as its general manager, but it was only after I arrived and everybody proclaimed that I was the first minority in the market of general manager, that they he then declared himself, more Cuban than American, and I said to him, "Dick [ph.], it's too late, I'm the guy."
Story_ID: 237598
Speaker 1: Let me ask you two quick questions if you could explain for us.  You talked a little bit about O & O--owned and operated--can you kind of explain what that means?
Speaker 2: Sure, each network during the '70s [1970s] and the '80s [1980s] were allowed to own about five television stations and those were called your owned and operated stations because you controlled them, and most of the managers of the owned and operated stations were hired by the corporate headquarters people out of New York [New York].  Other stations, either independents or affiliates, and affiliates can be a CBS or an NBC station, but they're owned by someone else other than the network.
Speaker 1: And can you also explain to us what a general manager does?  I think people have a pretty good idea of what a news director does, but perhaps not a general manager.  What does a general manager do?
Speaker 2: Well a general manager is responsible for all things related to the television station.  From my way of thinking, the first thing a general manager is responsible for was protecting the license.  Television stations operate on public airways and at that time every three years or five years you'd have to go back and reapply for your license.  In order to get your license you had to be a good citizen, not a good corporate citizen, a good citizen of your community, and I loved that part of it, but so that was the main responsibility, protecting the license, but then you also are in charge of all the revenue-producing units, primarily ad [advertisement] sales, but also you're in charge of news and programming.  The general manager is the person who runs that station.  Also at that time we also did editorials and I did editorials as the general manager of WBBM[-TV] in Chicago [Illinois].
Story_ID: 237599
Speaker 1: I come back as general manager, I think it was either 1984 or '85 [1985] and again having been at the station before I knew all the people so the questions about whether a black person should be there or not, didn't come up as much because I was known, not only known to the people in the station having been the assistant news director there before, but I was known by the press and known by the community [Chicago, Illinois], so for some people it was like, "Welcome back," but what most people wanted was someone who could lead them out of the morass the station was in and I was successful at doing that.
Speaker 2: And how had television changed and more particularly BBM [WBBM-TV, Chicago, Illinois]?  It had been ten years almost since you'd been back, what were some of the noticeable changes?
Speaker 1: Well the whole world had changed because of tabloid news.
Speaker 2: Could you explain what tabloid news is?
Speaker 1: Well tabloid news is essentially the television version of things like The National Enquirer where it is almost the lowest common denominator is what's appealing to the readers or the viewers, but the thing is you had to do it in order to compete.  You had to sort of be more blue collar than intellectual and, and that was sort of foreign to me, I mean I didn't want to dumb down the news, I wanted it to be enlightening and elevating, but you had to do what it took to win.  So as general manager of the station, I brought in a news director who had a great, great track record of being successful at the ABC stations because I wanted to change the CBS culture which was, again based on traditions, and Edward R. Murrow's values, I wanted to win.  So I brought in an ABC news director and we did much better.
Speaker 2: Was there a lot of resistance to it at first?
Speaker 1: Oh, there always is resistance because interestingly enough when a television doesn't do well, we always change the top management, but it's always the core people, the writers and producers who always outlast every management team, and a lot of the responsibility and fault for poor performance is in this base of employees who never leave and refuse to change.  So yes there was great reluctance to that, but then as the years went around employees became more sophisticated and understanding the economics of what we were doing and realized that the greatest danger in fact to a free press is red ink.  So if we didn't get the numbers, we didn't get the revenue, if we didn't get the revenues we couldn't afford to do the news that we all wanted to do.
Story_ID: 237600
Speaker 1: You would eventually leave CBS [WBBM-TV, Chicago, Illinois], why, why did you leave?
Speaker 2: Well before I left CBS when I was general manager in Chicago [Illinois], I got promoted.  I got promoted to president of the CBS Television Stations division, so now I not only was in charge of Chicago, I was in charge of New York [New York], Los Angeles [California], Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], Miami [Florida] and Minneapolis-St. Paul [Minnesota].  So rather than (unclear) than moving back to New York to be one of those New York executives who always sorted ordered people about, I decided to keep the job in Chicago, so I was the president of the CBS Television Stations division operating out of Chicago with all these other responsibilities, and that was just a great job and purely management job.  I mean, during that period in time we bought a station [WWJ-TV] in Detroit [Michigan], we moved antennas around in Miami [Florida], we just improved a lot of operations.  So in fact I was the person who hired the general managers at the CBS Television Stations and, and one of the great pleasures for me was the general manager we had in Philadelphia [KYW-TV, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] who happened to be African American, so in Philadelphia it was me, reporting to me was this African American general manager, reporting to him was this African American news director, reporting to the African American news director was the African American executive producer and the talent on the air was black.  I mean we just sort of did it, but we did it within the system and it didn't cause anything else, and that Philadelphia station was the most successful of all our CBS-owned stations during that period.
Story_ID: 237601
Speaker 1: Why did you leave CBS in 1998 I believe?
Speaker 2: I left CBS in 1996.
Speaker 1: Ninety-six [1996] I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: Because CBS was sold to Westinghouse [Electric Corporation, Westinghouse Broadcasting Company], and Westinghouse saw a lot of value in CBS, but where they saw the most value was in the [CBS] Television Stations division, the division I ran, which--and we were by far the most profitable division in all of CBS, so it was a culture clash.  There was Westinghouse [Broadcasting] stations and there were CBS stations and there was really only room for one executive, and so essentially I was--my contract was bought out and I retired for the first time, and it was fine with me because I thought I had done a lot.  I wanted to spend more time with my family.  I know everybody says that, but I really wanted to, I mean I adore my wife [Royal Kennedy] and children [David Rodgers and Jamie Rodgers], but that wasn't enough adoring my wife and children (laughter), I drove them crazy (laughter), and I remember within six weeks my wife says, "Can't you find a job, can't you go do something?" And about that time the phone rang and it was a headhunter from New York [New York] that the Discovery Channel was looking for someone to head up their entire United States operation, and I left retirement after ninety days and fortunately ended up as the president of the Discovery Networks [U.S.].  The Discovery Networks were based near Washington, D.C. so the family and I moved to Washington, D.C.  At the time Discovery had two major channels: the Learning Channel and the Discovery Channel.  By the time I left eight years later they had fourteen channels, including Animal Planet, Travel [Channel] and Discovery Health [Channel].
Speaker 1: Let's back up a little bit, when you left CBS, did you feel like you were forced out?
Speaker 2: Oh, no (laughter) you spend so much time in the news business and you always cover these stories of people who leave with these quote "golden parachutes."  Now my parachute wasn't golden, but at least it was bronze, but, no, it didn't bother me at all.  In fact, it's, it's sort of sad to look back on it but that being part of the American dream, to leave a company with a reasonable-size paycheck.  That meant something to me, I--you know in a way it was saying to me, hey, you--you made it. And, and the fact is it was enough money to plan for my family's, primarily my children's future.  So I was able to take that money and invest in college bonds so I knew if I never worked another day, they could go to Stanford [University, Stanford, California] if they could get in and it would be paid for.  So it was a sense of comfort.  In the television business I hope we all realize that after about seven years it's time to move on, let somebody else come in.  I understand that, there's a reason that television shows don't last twenty years on the air.  Our attention span changes, but so, too, does attention span of the executives, and you have to move on and you need to give someone else a shot. So no, it was truly not a problem.  Westinghouse bought us, that's not a problem, I'll see you around the corner--
Story_ID: 237602
Speaker 1: So when you get this call from the headhunter in New York [New York], were you thinking, cable--no way, or were you thinking, wow?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, being an arrogant broadcaster at the time I did not really understand the value of cable, but what I did note was the Discovery [Networks U.S.] brand, and the Discovery brand is me, it's, it's intellectual curiosity.  I mean, I saw that in the headhunters look that that's what they were looking for, I said, "That's me".  You know my interests are varied and deep, I mean I love science, I love math, I love history, I love exploration and that's what Discovery is all about.  Now, as a journalist you cover what happens today then you don't cover it anymore, but to have the ability to do an hour-long program on a subject that was of interest to me was great and then also to discover the beauty of cable.  Because the cable operators pay the programmers a fee, in addition to the advertising revenue you get, you really can be true to your core audience.  When I was at CBS--be it at the news division or the [CBS Television] Stations division, I would do things to reach the broadest possible audience because that was a requirement. At Discovery and at other cable networks all I had to do was please those five million people who are really interested in the subject that I'm presenting to them, and that was just pure heaven for me.  I would go home with this huge smile on my face and with this sort of sense of fulfillment that I hadn't sold out, that I hadn't done anything wrong, that everything I was putting on that television channel is something I'd be proud to watch myself and certainly proud to watch with my family.
Speaker 1: So and no more tabloid news and sensational (unclear)?
Speaker 2: No, we did sensational stuff but we made dinosaurs sensational, we made exploration exciting.  I mean one of the first things we did when I got to Discovery was we went live to the Titanic.  We took a live camera down to the bottom of the [Atlantic] Ocean and shot it from the Titanic.  I mean that, so to me is exciting and that's good television and it brings a lot of news and information.  I'd rather do that than do tabloid journalism.
Story_ID: 237603
Speaker 1: Who was the core audience for Discovery [Networks U.S.]?
Speaker 2: Well for Discovery it's, it's basically it--are men between the ages of like thirty and forty-five, men with intellectual curiosity.  Now enough sort of upscale people watch us that it is has one of the highest average incomes per viewer, but the real audience were cab drivers and sort of blue collar workers who really got into this and, you know, I'm, I'm sure everyone's been in a cab and more cabs than not the guys listen to NPR [National Public Radio], when they get home they watch Discovery, and they would feed it back to you as you were in the cab, so the audience crossed a lot of lives, but it was mostly male.
Speaker 1: And what was the culture like at Discovery when you first arrived in 1998?
Speaker 2: Well, it was interesting because one of the reasons I was hired was to help them take the next step.  They had been for the previous fourteen years building their brand and they built a great brand.  When you heard the word, "discovery," you knew what it meant and what it stood for and one of the things it stood for was quality programming.  So essentially I needed to make them more commercial.  I needed to make them more realistic but on the other side I also needed to take a look at the production operation because in order to get that quality they were spending a lot of money and I wanted to help them to find other ways to do that, but also at the same time the term "documentary" meant something else and to a lot of people it meant--oh, it's slow and there's talking heads, and essentially we converted what we did at Discovery from documentaries to what we called "factual films" and we tried to put all those elements that you see in the theater in Hollywood or in high-budget television shows into our factual films, so even though it was based on fact, and it had the essence of a documentary you looked at it, it was like watching a, a high cost Hollywood production.
Speaker 1: And was part of making Discovery more commercial creating more networks that were appealing to women and children and, you know, other audiences?
Speaker 2: Well yes because you know you always have this fear in the broadcasting business or the cable business that your audience is going die out on you, so you always need to replenish it, and so Judith [A.] McHale who was the COO of Discovery when I was there had this vision and we had this board of directors who fortunately had a lot of money and, and loved what we do, that were able to expand and yes we wanted to be from the cradle to the grave, so among the channels we created was Discovery Kids, we created Discovery Health for sort of older viewers.  We, we took tTe Learning Channel, made it TLC and made it a female skewing channel with great things like '[A] Wedding Story' and '[A] Dating Story' and these makeover shows, and then we expanded it, we bought the Travel Channel and travel tends to skew older; so we're taking care of the older demographic.  Animal Planet was the perfect vehicle for families, and so yes, it was a strategy that was designed and we had the ability to do it because every one of those channels it was factual films that we presented.
Story_ID: 235716
Speaker 1: Can we talk a little about the process by which when you were at Discovery [Networks U.S.], how you all decided like what the next step would be and how you implemented all of these networks and channels because it seemed like it all kinda happened at once?
Speaker 2: Yeah, what was important to us at Discovery was to dominate the non-fiction television.  We really didn't have any competitors out there.  We knew that Nat Geo [National Geographic Channel] was sort of around the corner, but there really wasn't anyone in our space and in order to protect our space we decided to create our own blocking backs.  So why wait for someone else to create this document channel for families, we did Animal Planet.  Travel Channel, you know, we didn't own, it was owned by the people who run The Weather Channel, but they weren't having any luck with it, we thought we'd do better so we just bought that channel, re-launched it and turned it around and, and made it bigger, but it was the essence of, let's do all the factual programming we can, let's try to get, if possible, ten percent of the shelf space in the cable industry to present quality non-fiction programming.
Speaker 1: Do you think that Discovery [Channel] was, that was our introduction to reality TV?
Speaker 2: Oh, well yes and no; there's a show out now that's quite successful called 'CSI[: Crime Scene Investigation'].  'CSI' was based on one of our shows called 'The New Detectives.'  Yeah, so I think we inspired--before Mark Burnett did 'Survivor' he did 'Eco-Challenge[: The Expedition Race'] on Discovery. The fact is no, it didn't become reality in the bad sense of reality, it was reality in the sense that it was all real.
Speaker 1: Right, I'm sorry that's what I meant and I guess when we think of reality TV it does somewhat have a negative connotation, but in terms of right, just real and not so much like edited and that kind of thing, you kind of, you know, just get a feel for exactly what's happening.
Speaker 2: Well you know John Hendricks created the Discovery Channel and, and the reason he did it was that all the networks announced in the late '60s [1960s] that they were through with documentaries, that not enough Americans watched documentaries, there was obviously no interest and they were too expensive to do so they just weren't going to do 'em any more or were going to do very, very few.  John Hendricks, who loved watching documentaries, said, "No, no, no; there has to be a way that we can get documentaries."  He raised money, or tried to raise money, and was having difficulty, he went to see Walter Cronkite, told Walter what his idea was.  Walter wrote a letter of support, John was able then to raise the money to create the Discovery Channel, and again, his mission was, "I want a place where people can watch documentaries," so that's how Discovery came and yeah, less real programming, less reality but more documentary at the time.  Again, like I said, when I did it I encouraged this conversion, less from the traditional documentary to the factual film, and that's just as exciting as, as any scripted drama is.  In fact I remember one review of one our shows where the critic essentially said, you know, "If fiction was as interesting as fact, you know, we'd be in better place, but the fact is factual is much more interesting than fiction if you present it in the right way."
Story_ID: 235717
Speaker 1: And of course you set out on this endeavor to be successful, but were you a little surprised at how quickly the success came?
Speaker 2: No and that's attributed to the Discovery [Networks U.S.] brand, whenever we would introduce a new channel and have to present it to the advertisers, or the cable operators, they understood our legacy.  They understood our, our blood line and because Discovery just does such a great job, as does TLC [The Learning Channel], it was easy for us to, to expand.
Speaker 1: Were there some ideas that didn't quite make it, some ideas for channels?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we looked at doing science fiction before the Sci-Fi Channel [Syfy] came about, but we thought the fiction part of it would be counter to our brand so we just created a channel that's just pure science channel.  The History Channel [History] is an idea that was presented to John Hendricks prior to my arrival.  I'd like to think that had I been there we would have done The History Channel as well, but as it was, the executives at the time passed on the idea.
Speaker 1: Why would you have done it (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And A&E eventually picked it up.  'Cause I love history and I had ideas of how you could make history exciting.  One of the reasons that they convinced the senior management of Discovery not to do history was quote, "It's just a whole bunch of black and white footage about World War II [WWII]," you know, you and I both know there's much more to history than that.
Story_ID: 235718
Speaker 1: Were you a little taken back with the success of a lot of the shows on TLC [The Learning Channel], 'Trading Spaces' and a lot of these decorating shows that--
Speaker 2: No not at all.
Speaker 1: Not even a little?
Speaker 2: No, if you look at the demographics of who's watching and when they're watching and sort of what their needs are, when I first saw, when the general manager of TLC brought me 'Trading Spaces,' and she had it scheduled in the afternoon because she was unsure of how it'd play or should it be that type of show.  I said, "This thing's great, it's going to be in prime time," so no, my gut told me that that was going to be a hit and it turned out to be a great hit.
Speaker 1: Why did you think it was going to be a hit?
Speaker 2: Because it's about real people and about surprising real people and it's about taking care of real people in the same way that my favorite day--part of all the channels that we had at Discovery [Networks U.S.] was TLC in the afternoon with '[A] Wedding Story' and '[A] Baby Story' and 'Reunion Story' [ph.].  It was just seeing human emotion and we were always able to make sure that they ended right.  If they didn't end right we just wouldn't put it on the air, and, and that those same elements existed in 'Trading Spaces' where people were doing stuff for each other and then there was the payoff and the surprise.  Now we got the format from the Brits [British].  Now, theirs was funnier than ours 'cause they were mean, they'd come in and see a room, they'd say, "I hate this," or "This sucks," you know, the Americans were sort of gracious, you know and, but the thing is the camera's right there and when it's right there you can see really what the emotion is.  Yeah, so no, I thought it would work and it certainly did work.
Speaker 1: And how expensive was this, this program?  Was it, was it pretty expensive or--
Speaker 2: Relatively speaking it is expensive, but, but fictional programming probably costs about four times as much per hour as does factual programming.  So it is less expensive to do that than it is to do scripted.
Speaker 1: Because you don't have to hire actors and you have real people just--
Speaker 2: Or one of my favorite lines is: "You don't have to pay Lassie residuals."
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Story_ID: 235719
Speaker 1: And so you stayed at Discovery [Networks U.S.] for six years and why did you leave Discovery?
Speaker 2: Again, there was this opportunity to consolidate my finances by making a move at a certain time, but also in the back of my mind was this opportunity to help create a channel for African American adults.  So when there was, when it turned out there was a contractual window in my contract, I decided to exercise it primarily to retire for the second time, and--
Speaker 1: The parachute, was it golden at this point?
Speaker 2: The parachute was there, no it had got to the silver level (laughter), albeit it hadn't gotten to gold yet, but it went up from bronze to silver.  So again, I was then now able to take care of the rest of my family, so I took care of me and my wife [Royal Kennedy], and again truly planned to just sort of sit back and use the computer and watch TV and become a news junkie and read a lot, but again, like always, drove my wife crazy.  I mean I don't know what it is (laughter), maybe she just didn't want me around the house.  Maybe that's what she's trying to say, but then I met this wonderful human being named [HistoryMaker] Alfred Liggins [III], and Alfred Liggins is a young man who is the CEO of Radio One [Silver Spring, Maryland], and he had this dream, and wherewithal, to create another cable channel.  He was a friend of Bob Johnson's, his mother was [HistoryMaker] Cathy Hughes, and under Cathy, Alfred had taken her empire from this one radio station in [Washington] D.C. to what is now seventy urban radio stations.  He had turned that company around and made it a huge success. And what was important to him was to grow the family business and to really occupy all the platforms in the African American space and the television was one.  We met, we hit it off, we lived a half mile away from each other, we both had similar visions.  He has money, and, and he has vision, I have vision and I have operational skills so together we were able to create a template for what eventually became TV One [Silver Spring, Maryland].
Story_ID: 235720
Speaker 1: What is TV One [Silver Spring, Maryland] and who's the core audience for TV One?
Speaker 2: TV One is a cable and satellite channel that's targeted for African American adults, and by African American adults I mean really people over the age of eighteen.  TV One is not a family channel, it's not a kid's channel, it's not a teenagers' channel.  It is a channel that features lifestyle and entertainment programming really directed at African American adults.  We knew when we started this channel that BET [Black Entertainment Television] was out there and BET is highly, highly successful, and we have great admiration for them. But what it turns out is that their self-selected audience, after having been on television for twenty years, is a younger skewing audience than that which we were going after.  You know, their median age is around twenty-two, and that just a lot of the rest of us there, but also what bothered me was that we only had one channel on all of cable and if your cable has forty, or eighty or 150 channels, I don't care, but to have only one African American channel on--there's something wrong with that and I think that's a detriment to the society, and then when BET was sold to Viacom [Inc.] we had zero African American owned television outlets on cable, and with my broadcasting background, I mean it just smacked to me of being wrong.  Wrong in terms of public policy, wrong in terms of, of the cable industry's activity and wrong in terms of relationships.  So, yes, the space is there but what's even more important is the message we send by being successful, because there's no reason there shouldn't be African American owned and operated programs and services on cable and satellite.
Speaker 1: And what do you say to those who say, "This is in direct competition with BET--TV One is in direct competition with BET?"
Speaker 2: Well, the people who say that are, are somewhat not sophisticated because clearly what cable is, cable is a targeted medium.  Lifetime goes after women between the ages of twenty-five and fifty-four.  MTV goes after young people between the ages of eighteen and thirty-four.  Nick [Nickelodeon] goes after people between the ages of twelve and twenty-four.  So each cable network is designed to really hit a specific demographic, BET hits a demographic that is significantly younger than I, and so they have a right to exist and they are highly successful.  We are not in competition, the competition for TV One is Lifetime, it's TNT, it's TBS, it's USA [Network], it's Home and Garden [HGTV], it's TLC [The Learning Channel], it's not, I repeat, it's not BET or VH1 or, or any of those types of channels.
Story_ID: 235721
Speaker 1: Can you tell us a little bit about the relationship with TV One [Silver Spring, Maryland] and Comcast Cable [Communications, LLC]?  How, what's, how did that all work?
Speaker 2: Comcast Cable is a major investor in TV One and that's really highly beneficial for us because to have a cable partner gives you a leg up on your competition.  However, it just levels the playing field because every, most every other successful cable network has a cable distributor partner.  TNT's partner is Time Warner Cable, you know, BET's [Black Entertainment Television] partner is Viacom [Inc.], ABC Family's [Freeform] partner is [The Walt] Disney [Company], you know you gotta have a big partner to be successful.  Our big partners, we fortunately we have two, are Radio One [Silver Spring, Maryland] and Comcast and that is highly beneficial to us.  Because of this partnership with Comcast we were able to launch in major American cities that feature--have large African American populations because TV One is important to the people at Comcast and they say it over and over and over again.
Story_ID: 235722
Speaker 1: What was your vision, or what is your vision for TV One [Silver Spring, Maryland]?
Speaker 2: To create a home base for African Americans where twenty-four seven you can tune in and see yourself and be proud of what you see.  I have nothing against music videos, but there is more to African American life than music videos.  I have nothing against stand-up comics, but there is much more to African American life than stand-up comics.  So I wanted to show the full breadth, I wanted shows like 'City of Angels' that shows African American doctors; I wanted a show like 'Boston Public' that shows African American principals and teachers, and that's what we have on TV One.  I wanted shows like a cooking show for us, I wanted to create a dating show where African Americans get the date.  I wanted to create makeover shows where they talk about our skin color, our body shape, our hair texture.  I wanted this at long last in this society in this industry for the--be something there for us.  You know at a certain point you just get tired of the tokenism you know, on 'The Apprentice' there's one black male, there's one black female.  On 'Survivor,' there's one black male and one black female and they get voted off you know.  To even think that we have a chance on 'The Bachelor' is to really deceive yourself, and, and so shame on them.  I really wanted a place that's our place, you know, yeah I do believe in diversity and I would love everybody to watch TV One and get and just feel good about what we African Americans have contributed, but this channel is really for us.  It is uniquely African American and when you watch it you can feel it and you can taste it and you could smell it and it's us and it's our roots right there on the television screen.
Story_ID: 235723
Speaker 1: Some of the criticism initially was, "Geez, you know why are we seeing reruns of 'Good Times' and shows like that, you know, this is, you know, a network [TV One, Silver Spring, Maryland] that's supposed to make us proud of who we are, why are we going back to that?"  How do you respond to some of that criticism?
Speaker 2: The, the highest ranking shows on cable for African Americans are as follows: Nick at Nite, why, because they have 'The Cosby Show' and 'The Fresh Prince [of Bel-Air'], so African Americans have clearly expressed a desire to go back and see shows that we grew up with, so our putting 'Good Times' on to me was great because we did research and surveys and many viewers said that they wanted it on.  The, the second highest rated show on cable--channel on cable is TNT with their 'Law and Order' reruns.  So that's why we have shows like 'Boston Public' and 'City of Angels' so again we're answering those, those needs.  As to the repetition, the repetition is there as a cable staple, and, and as you know any cable channel you watch there is a lot of repeats.  What was sort of the disconnect in the early days was that African Americans tended--had waited so long for something like us, they tended to turn us on in the morning and not turn us off.  They tended to watch us like they listened to radio.  Now the average American watches any cable channel at about--in increments of about fifteen minutes at a time.  We found early days that they were watching us for hours and hours and hours and so yes, our business plan and our glide path is, is identical to that which I did when successfully launched twelve other channels at Discovery [Networks U.S.].  You start off and unfortunately there are repeats until you get to be as large as you need to be.
Story_ID: 235724
Speaker 1: Tell us a little bit about some of the original programming on TV One [Silver Spring, Maryland]?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, we, I like to do genres that we haven't participated in.  So we have a dating show which we call 'Get the Hook Up' and you know, it's, it's our version of a dating show and in fact in order to win the date you have to have skills.  You have to be able to dance and talk to people and, you know, you, everybody's been to a party and you know somebody comes up and put their hand over their mouth and talks to you those are among the skills you have to get the date or and get the hook up.  'Makeover Manor' is our makeover show which we shot in Atlanta [Georgia], and again, it's, it's you know, it's our people, it's our hair dressers, our, our clothing designers working with African Americans and helping us feel better about ourselves and looking better.  We have a show coming up called 'Divine Restoration.'  Now you know everybody has these home makeover shows, but you know what we're doing, we're making over churches, real small churches that have some historical significance that have congregations of five hundred and smaller.  We're going there with advertisers and rebuild those churches and you and I both know how long these people been raising money in their church fund.  They'll never get there, but that's a show that, that again we could tell the history of, we could talk about the church, its ministers, its congregation and rebuild the show and get a great television show that has the same sense of warmth.  We have a show called 'Full Plate' [ph.] which deals with the hectic life of many African American women who are trying to balance everything, you know, work and home and career and babies and family and 'Full Plate' is essentially our Sunday dinner where we could sit down with these women, help them get through this full plate experience and talk about things and have interesting television.  We have a cooking show featuring a chef out of Southern California named '[Turn Up the Heat with] G. Garvin.'  Now I know everybody has cooking shows, but how do you get a cooking show and make it uniquely black. We hire a uniquely black chef and let him jump through the television screen and, and this is a show where he refers you back to his auntie or, or your big mama and when talks about these things it brings back those memories that we had.  Getting up in the morning and smelling the biscuits cooking, or going there for Thanksgiving dinner and seeing the candied yams, and it comes across.  It's about us and it is us, so those are the types of original programs we're doing.

Speaker 1: And tell us a little bit about Patti LaBelle's show ['Living It Up with Patti Labelle'] and 'B. Smith [With Style'], too, both of them.
Speaker 2: Well interestingly enough about B. Smith, B. Smith has been around for a long time.  We bought her reruns and we launched with a lot of her reruns and interestingly enough we got a lot of feedback from the audience thanking us for putting 'B. Smith' on television.  They did not know that she'd already been on television twenty years, because she was always buried at midnight or 2:00 or 3:00 A.M., so again that's another advantage in having a channel that's ours, we could reintroduce people like B. Smith so, so the rest of the world can see.  Patti LaBelle, bless her heart, she knows we have very little money.  She essentially has volunteered to do this show out of support for our effort, but out of her affection for [HistoryMaker] Cathy Hughes, and so we don't pay her very much.  We don't pay her what she deserves, but she's willing to grow with us, and we really appreciate people doing that, and again we're new you know, I, I know we like to talk bigger and, and show things bigger but we're growing you know, you know ten months into our existence we were only available in five million households.  Networks like BET [Black Entertainment Television] and TNT and--they're in eighty million households, so you can imagine how much more money they have to invest in programming that I do.  You know I'm spending other peoples' money now and I'm not going to spend it foolishly, so we will grow and as our distribution grows so, too, will the quality of our production and the amount of money we're able to contribute to the creative community.
Speaker 1: And what do you anticipate in terms of the distribution growth, like where do you think TV One [Silver Spring, Maryland] will be the next five years from now, so--
Speaker 2: That we will be fully distributed within the next five years, that not only will every African American household in America have the opportunity to see TV One, but so, too, will the rest of the population because a lot of us think that's important, too.  You know imagine this, you're a white American and there are eighty cable channels, but only one for white Americans, and it's MTV.  Now is that how you want people to see you as just this MTV, that, that the 'Real World' values are your values, that the Eminem videos is who you are and what you think?  But that's what our life has been like with only BET chronicling and presenting our interests.  So a lot--I will tell you a lot of people out there think that all we do is dance and, and tell jokes and I can do neither, I will tell you, so, down the road we hope that people will tune into us so that they have a, a broader view of the African American experience as, as seen on television.
Speaker 1: Are you a little concerned about the direction in which television in general is going?  It seems like, you know, we're, everything is kinda moving under one umbrella, you know like one company is really owning everything in terms of like production and that kind of thing, so what are some of your thoughts about that?
Speaker 2: That I understand the economic need to do it because programming is really, really expensive, an average reality hour here in 2004 costs you $800,000 to produce.  To buy a scripted half hour sitcom will cost you $1.2 million, to buy a scripted drama hour minimum is probably about $1.8 million.  So the costs are so outrageous that you need to control them as much as you can but be able to receive as much money in return for having produced these shows or, if you can, produce them again.  So that's the direction we're headed in and that's why there's a lot of--and that's the argument in Washington [D.C.] about why single companies need more and more outlets.  That's fine as long as Radio One's going to be one of these companies that has radio and television and newspapers and magazines, and I do believe that's Alfred's [HistoryMaker Alfred Liggins III] and Cathy's goal, and that's what's crucially important to us.  Just get us a seat at the table.  If you're going to do it where there's only six people doing it, just don't let it be six white men doing it.  Open up the doors.
Story_ID: 235726
Speaker 1: What's your favorite show so far on TV One [Silver Spring, Maryland]?
Speaker 2: Oh, my favorite show on TV One, well the dating show was, 'Get the Hook Up,' just because it was funny and it was hilarious (laughter), and one of the more interesting stories is when we started off the show, at the end of the show you'd have one man and one woman, and the person who was picked got the option of going out on a date or picking a special gift that was behind the curtain, and most people to their credit would pick the date until--it was a rumor going around that what was behind the curtain was either a flat screen TV or a PlayStation 2 video game.  From that point on every guy would not take the date but would pick behind the curtain and to the point where I told the people to take those gifts away because the brothers would say to me afterwards, "Yo man, I get a flat screen TV, I can get as many dates as I want."  So we had to lower the quality of the dates because part of his goal was to make sure that the African American women were taken care of, so I eliminated those gifts.
Story_ID: 235727
Speaker 1: And, in terms of distribution, how--what's the distribution level right now for TV One [Silver Spring, Maryland]?
Speaker 2: Well the distribution process is that you go to the various cable operators and the various systems.  You present your channel and then you negotiate deals, and so we are in that process and it changes day-to-day, week-to-week, so it's hard to say where we are now, but our goal is to be in around ten million households by the end of our first year and to be in over 25 million households by the end our second year.
Speaker 1: So for people who don't have TV One but would like to see it, through their--on their--through cable outlet what should they do?
Speaker 2: Well that's why we say TV One is more than just another network, it's a movement because we think it means a lot of things to people, and so truly all they have to do is say call their cable operator or their satellite provider and not ask for it, I'd say demand it, because African Americans represent only ten percent of cable subscribers, but we provide twenty percent of cable's revenues, so and what are we paying for?  We're not, we're paying for no African American owned services and no choice within our space.  Now again, yes we do watch everything that's on TV, but it's clear that African Americans watch television differently than does the general population.  Any, on any given week you'll see the general population ratings, the African American ratings, and rarely do they cross and rarely is there any show in the African American top ten that's in the general market top ten and the reverse because we tend to watch shows that respect us that are about us, that feature us and are in situations and settings that are familiar to us, and so we're taken for granted by all those other channels I will tell you, TV One is a home base.
Speaker 1: Will we ever see music videos and that kinda thing on TV One?
Speaker 2: Well not having music videos is one of the ways we differentiate ourselves from some other people, so the fact is, another reason we're not a competitor with BET [Black Entertainment Television], they do music videos we don't do music videos.  They do it well, you know.  Will I ever do big concerts or award shows?  Probably not for a while, I can't beat BET, they do those.  I mean the last two award shows BET's had have just been spectacular.  I can't afford to do that now, that is not our expertise now, so it will be awhile before we do that sort of thing.
Story_ID: 235728
Speaker 1: And you know [HistoryMaker] Mr. [Johnathan] Rodgers when you look back at your life what stands out the most to you and why?
Speaker 2: I, I think what most stands out to me is my mother [Barbara Merriwether Rodgers] taking me to church [Mount Zion Missionary Baptist Church, Oakland, California] and making sure that those teachings were in me to create a foundation and then based on the way she lived her life, I took that foundation and grew on it and, and I think learned how to treat people, how to respect people. And the fact is I got into management because I observed in this industry that managers seemed not to care about people, that they were yellers and they're screamers and those were the ones who got promoted.  Those were the ones who were considered successful and I said, "I don't believe it has to be that way," so again taking this sort of religious training and sort of--my mother's sort of gracefulness--you know I think I've become a pretty good manager, a pretty good executive, just by carrying those values.
Story_ID: 235729
Speaker 1: You know the one thing we didn't talk about was your, your wife [Royal Kennedy] is also in television but on the other side, the talent side.  What was that like for you all, you know having two people in television and you know still being able to maintain a very successful relationship which, unfortunately, isn't the case in many situations?
Speaker 2: Well my wife and I in face when we were in Cleveland [Ohio], we were both on-air reporters [WKYC-TV, Cleveland, Ohio], she much more successful than I because she's real good at it and I wasn't, but we are both television kids so when I fell in love with her, and wanted to guarantee that she would marry me, I proposed to her on the news in front of all the citizens of Cleveland, and of course she couldn't say no there.
Speaker 1: How could she say no?
Speaker 2: Absolutely, but was she mad at me (laughter). And I remember she got a call from the concierge at her apartment building saying that a package had arrived, and she said--she called her sister and said, "He sent me something, maybe it's the ring," and she runs home and it's this huge box, and she thought maybe it was one of those sort of Russian tricks you open the box, smaller, smaller box.  She opens up and it was only one box because in this box was this big screened television.  She was disappointed.  She says, "Television!"  I said, "Look, if we're going to be in love, and I'm going to come to your house, I need a good television," (laughter), and I never found out that she was expecting a ring until much later down the list.  So I thought I had done a good deed, and boy was she disappointed, but that was how much television was important to me and less so important to her.
Story_ID: 237604
Speaker 1: So she gets a job offer in Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 2: Right, so my wife [Royal Kennedy] gets this job offer in Chicago and she says to me, you know, I know we're engaged but I'm moving to Chicago and I'll see you later, you know, and to her credit I mean her job was very important to her.  She had worked very hard at it; she had started off after Columbia [University] in New York [New York].  She had gone to New Orleans [Louisiana], and then to Cleveland [Ohio] and here's the perfect opportunity to go to Chicago, and of course I'm not going to stand in her way.  So I said, "Sure, why don't you go, and I will join you.  I don't need to have a job," and the fact was we moved to Chicago.  She was a star reporter at the NBC station [WMAQ-TV, Chicago, Illinois] and I got to Chicago and did not have a job and could not find a job, and so I was a house husband for a while, but I was a bad house husband 'cause I didn't clean up, I didn't cook.  I just sort of moped around wondering why I couldn't get a job and the fact was I'd looked a lot of places, applied a lot of places.  I wasn't that good a reporter so showing my tape didn't necessarily matter, but one night at a, a dinner party I met the person who was the news director of the CBS station [WBBM-TV, Chicago, Illinois] in Chicago, ended up charming his wife, we then had a conversation, and it just so happened he had a job opening for an assistant news director.  I took the job and so after about nine months of not being any work in Chicago, being supported by my lovely wife, and thank you Royal for that, I got a job and that started off my management career.  Was there conflicts?  Yes, they were the sort of good, fun conflicts.  It'd be my station against her station, who covered the news best and these sorts of things.  I remember meeting her general manager of her station who said to Royal, "I know you're married to [HistoryMaker] Johnathan [Rodgers], I don't care if you guys sleep together, just don't talk."  So that became sort of our philosophy (laughter) so we wouldn't talk about business, but we were so competitive that it'd always come out. And I remember one day, in fact when the first Mayor [Richard J.] Daley died, we just cleaned their clocks.  I used to brag about that, but then a couple of months later an "L" [elevated] train fell of the track and they just cleaned our clock and the she would be up.  So yes we were competitive, but interestingly enough Money magazine decided to put us both on the cover in order to do an article about people married to the same career.  So on Money magazine here's me and Royal and it was sort of the first cover I've ever done, and it was great.  It just sort of said a lot about us and our careers and you know we've learned how to live together.
Speaker 1: And was it difficult, you know, raising a family as well in this whole world, you know living in this whole world of TV and the crazy hours and that kind of thing?
Speaker 2: Well because my wife Royal is more grounded than I, by the time we had our first child, David [Rodgers] in 1982, Royal was a correspondent at ABC News in Los Angeles [California].  She was able to get them to give her the morning shift as in the 'Good Morning America' shift now here on the West Coast; 'Good Morning America' comes on at like 3:00 A.M.  So she was able to work a shift that got her home by nine in the morning, and so Royal early on was able to juggle this sort of motherhood and career, and take care of me at the same time, but working was important to her and she continued to do that, again, I think I was probably the typical part-time dad you know always working person, but we had a great life, and I think our son did as well.
Story_ID: 237605
Speaker 1: And what advice do you have for those who are interested in a career in television, first, perhaps, if they're interested in--on the talent side and then on the management side?
Speaker 2: Well if you're interested in television you need to watch it, understand it, but even more importantly you have to love it.  You can't apologize for what we do, because what we do entertains and informs 200 million Americans on a daily basis and you need to understand both the value of that, but the extreme power of that.  We are primarily in a television and entertainment medium, and you gotta like entertainment, you gotta like making people laugh, you gotta like making people cry.  You gotta like making people feel things but more importantly you need to just be able to portray on that screen all that we are.  You need to create that mirror, but never be ashamed at what you're doing and like what you're doing.  Understand the real power and if you do believe in change you can create change through entertainment and through information.
Speaker 1: And so you think that applies to both the talent side and the management side?
Speaker 2: Well the talent side is, is different because believe it or not those people on the talent side do not have the power we all think they have.  They simply are paid employees who read the words other people write for them.  Even news people, anchor people, read the words other people write for them.  Now reporters get to go out and do their reporting, but they're only one part of it.  It's the reporter, it's the cameraman, it's the sound man, it's the editor.  It's group journalism.  So, yeah if you're talent you get paid a lot of money, you get a lot of fame, but what are you really controlling.
Story_ID: 237606
Speaker 1: What are some--what do you think the future of television programming is?  Is it reality TV, I mean it seems like we're, we're seeing it everywhere, all the time on, you know, all the networks and even cable now.
Speaker 2: Yeah, well television cycles through programming through fads, interestingly enough in the four years preceding the introduction of 'The Cosby Show,' the sitcom was dead.  No, don't bring back a sitcom, nobody watches sitcoms anymore.  Prior to the introduction of 'CSI[: Crime Scene Investigation'] and 'Law & Order' the hour drama was dead, I mean it used to be that, that networks were programmed, you know sitcoms from eight to eleven because that was what people were watching and now it changes.  Now it's like dramas from nine to eleven, so it's cycles you just need to be on the leading edge of the cycle.  You can't be the first, but television people are great at being second, and third and fourth.  So whenever anything works as we all observed when 'Survivor' came along all of a sudden everybody had ten reality shows on their network.  So we're real good at following.  The true visionaries are the ones who do it first.
Speaker 1: But you even said that it's so much more expensive to produce scripted programming, so do you think that we're moving, we'll see a time when we're really moving away from scripted programming because it is so expensive?
Speaker 2: No, but--'cause it depends on the audience.  So the fact is if twice as many people will watch a scripted program as will watch a cheap reality show, then it pays off to do scripted programming, and again, it changes year-to-year.  It looks like this year 2004 the scripted programming is back and shows like 'Desperate Housewives' or 'Lost' or 'Boston Legal' they're at the top of the game as opposed to all those new reality shows.  So it depends on the year, so in 2005 heaven only knows.  I mean they pay us to have this sort of gut and be predictive, so in my case I like to plan in both camps.
Story_ID: 237607
Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community?
Speaker 2: That we will be assimilated, that we will lose that connection that we have to our history, to our past and those things that are uniquely African American.  Clearly we've lost the linkage to our past in Africa and never to be recaptured again.  I mean I don't care how many 'Roots[: The Saga of an American Family]' we do, that is still a foreign land to most of us, but that which is African American is, is really three hundred years old and mostly really two hundred years old and as it's just sort of beautiful and it's ours and I would just hate to lose that where we just all become one people.  We're not one people.  I mean the fact that the Italians celebrate their legacy and their birth, the Asians hopefully will never lose their connections to Asia and not become assimilated.  We should be all be proud of what we've contributed to this society, what we continue to contribute to this society, but at the same time never lose sight of where we came from and how we got to the point of contributing these things to society.
Story_ID: 237608
Speaker 1: And how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: Oh, I, you know, I don't know.  I think that's for someone else to judge, but my wife [Royal Kennedy] used to, even when she's mad at me she'd say stuff like, "You know, even people you fire like you," so the fact is if I'm remembered--"he's a nice guy, he treated people well," that would really be enough for me.
Story_ID: 237609
Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] Mr. [Johnathan] Rodgers is there anything that we didn't touch on that perhaps you'd like to add at this particular time?
Speaker 2: Yeah, let's talk a little bit about politics.
Speaker 1: Sure, absolutely.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Well--
Speaker 2: Yeah, you know one of the great things about television news is not that we slant the news to influence people or influence points of views, but in just the basic concept of balance and fairness we African American executives or African American producers or reporters can just sort of rewrite the vision.  So the fact is if we are running a news show and it's a welfare story, but we have a white welfare recipient on, all of a sudden that sort of changes people's views.  If it's an economic story about Wall Street and we have an African American stockbroker on, it just sort of changes people's views, that's why television is important and that's why it's important that African Americans get involved in decision-making positions because that's really who decides who's seen and what gets on television.
Speaker 1: And you know what are some of your thoughts about you know right now we're in the middle of an election a few weeks away, and there is a huge voter registration push from a lot of celebrities who are hip hop artists and not your traditional person who's saying, you know, "Make sure you get out there and vote."  What are some of your thoughts about that, do you think that it's effective?
Speaker 2: And that's one of the great things about life here at TV One [Silver Spring, Maryland] is we're in charge and we're responsible to ourselves and by definition responsible to other African Americans.  So we believe in voting, so we have done probably more PSAs [public service announcements] on voting than on any other single subject and on this one where I know we say we're targets--African American adults, we have one with Blair Underwood.  We have a [HistoryMaker] Russell Simmons spot with a whole bunch of rappers encouraging people to vote but also here at TV One we care about health issues and financial issues so we, we are--major campaigns on diabetes, on obesity, on, on adoption. No, those issues are important to us and we use our air time to send those messages out in the real true hope that we will be of benefit to the African Americans in this country.
