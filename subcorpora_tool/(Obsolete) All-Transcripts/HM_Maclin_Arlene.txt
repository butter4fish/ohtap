Story_ID: 25049
Speaker 1: I'm gonna ask about your family history.  I'm gonna ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's side.  But we start with your mother's side first.  Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: My mother's name was Alice, A-L-I-C-E, Matthews, M-A-T-T-H-E-W-S, Maclin, M-A-C-L-I-N.
Speaker 1: And what was her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Her date of birth was August 1st, 1906, and she was born in Dinwiddie County.
Speaker 1: That's Dinwiddie County, Virginia?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what can you tell us about your mother's side of the family?  How far back can you trace them, and what were they doing in history?
Speaker 2: Yeah, my, the furthest I can trace back my mother's side is to her, her grandfather, who was, lived on a plantation in the county.  He was a slave, and he was called Uncle Jimmy, Jimmy Matthews was his, the name that he had taken.  And he is the inventor of Brunswick Stew, that was, as I mentioned, was actually given a whole day in the, in the state capital back in the late '80's [1980s].  And that tradition, that family tradition was certain carried on by my uncle, my mother's brother, Uncle Thee, who was the stew maker for most events in the--that's when I was growing up in Brunswick County.
Story_ID: 25050
Speaker 1: Tell us, now, how did that come about?  Your great grandfather--and this is in the year, about what year is this?
Speaker 2: This probably is, I would say this must have happened in the early 1800s because my grandfather was born, this is Jimmy's son, was born on the plantation in 1840, we believe, about 1840.  And there's a story to be told there as well.  But Uncle Jimmy, as he was known in the county, in the area, must have been born in the last 1700s.  But I can't give you dates.  He clearly was alive in 1840 because he had a son, my grandfather.  But I cannot give you--but it was late, it must have been in the late 1700s.
Speaker 1: Now, what was your grandfather's name?
Speaker 2: My grandfather's name was George.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And there's a story for him as well?  I'll tell you that story.
Speaker 1: Okay, well, let's do the stew story first.
Speaker 2: The stew story.  The stew story is Uncle Jimmy, the plantation owners had gone away, and he was the cook for the plantation.  And so he made the stew, and the stew was made with squirrels and pretty much whatever he could find around, you know, in terms of food, onions, I'm sure, tomatoes, squirrels, as many as he could--as he had.  He probably had some squirrels that he had killed from the hunt the day before 'cause that's typically what would happen.  There would be people on the plantation who would go out and kill.  And he was the cook.  So he had access to all of this.  And so he made this--they were gone all day long.  So he made this stew, outdoor stew.  And it became known much later, of course, as Brunswick stew.  And as I've said earlier, it actually, we had a commemorative state capital commemorating Brunswick stew, originally from Brunswick County, Virginia at the State Capital in the 19--late '80's, 1980s.  And it was a whole day commemorating Uncle Jimmy's, as they called him, my great grandfather, the stew that he had made, the concoction, I guess you might call it today.
Speaker 1: Now, this is, I read online that there's some controversy over where it actually started?
Speaker 2: Yes, there was a, there's a county in the State of Georgia, Brunswick County, Georgia, who before this time had actually said that they were the originators of Brunswick stew.  But that is not the case.  Virginia actually had a commemorative day to make sure that they, in fact, it is really on the record that it is from Brunswick County, Virginia.
Speaker 1: So this is a stew that's popular all over the South, right?
Speaker 2: Absolutely.  I think it's, the more contemporary recipe actually uses chicken.  But it is known all over the South, and it's used for reunions, family reunions and lots of special family events.  People still make the stew.  And typically, when I was growing up, we always had a stew at the end of the, when we had harvested tobacco crop.  That was a celebration, depending on what, whether it was a good year or a bad year.  You had either Brunswick stew, which was very common or you would have, if it was a really good year, you had lamb stew.  And, of course, we had to go and buy the lamb 'cause we didn't have sheep.  And so Brunswick stew, and it's still, it's not made as much now because it's an all-day process.  And very few people want to spend all day making a stew.  But you still, occasionally, for special occasions, you would find, people still will make that throughout the South.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 25051
Speaker 1: Now, there's a story about your grandfather, George, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, my grandfather, George, was born on that same plantation, we believe, around 1840.  His, no, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.  Yeah, 1840, yes.  So he was also born on the plantation, and I asked my mother [Alice Matthews Maclin], I said, well, what did your father do?  And she hesitated somewhat, and then she said, well, my father never really worked.  He was the stockman on the plantation.  And so then as I probed her, I said, what did a stockman do?  Well, he, effectively, he was the, he was the stud on the plantation.  And then I asked, I said, well, what did he look like?  And she said, well, he was tall, the grandfather was--I never met him.  He was, she says, he was about 6'4", 6'5", very dark skinned, straight hair, pulled his hair back in a ponytail like and very fine features, very much like her own features.  And, but he was a big guy.  And so he was the, he was one of, I guess many, men who were used in that way on the plantation.
Speaker 1: It was a certain period of time when they started doing more breeding of slaves than buying.
Speaker 2: Exactly, it was cheaper, they figured out that it was cheaper to actually breed slaves, rather than bringing them from African on ships.  That was a cheaper process, and it was also--so they would grow their own pretty much.  So he was one of the--
Speaker 1: I think U.S. law in 1830 outlawed the African slave trade--
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: --part of it.
Speaker 2: Okay, so that, you put the history to it.  So he was born in 1840.  And, of course, so he was, and he died actually in 1920.  So he was eighty years old.  But he died.  But he was one of the people on that plantation who served as stock.  And that's what she called him, stockman.  I had never heard that expression before.  And it was interesting because when I was in--we're getting a little ahead of ourselves.  I was in North Carolina, and people said, would say, when I went to school in North Carolina, they'd say I want a stock dime.  And I said, I always wondered what was the origin of stock dime.  It meant a, just a dime in itself.  And I said, why stock dime.  And always, that was always a question I asked, but I--when my mother told me this story, it all began to come together in some ways because stock, stockman.  And I said, exactly what does that mean?  And then she explained what it meant.  So, that, so your timing and in terms of the outlawing of bringing slaves to the United States makes, gives that story some validity.
Speaker 1: Right, there are other such stories we've heard too, you know, from people.  So it's something that happened.  So it may mean actually, genetically, you're related to a lot of people--
Speaker 2: Absolutely.  In fact, I see people, and I say now, jokingly, he said, well, I saw somebody who looks just like you.  I said, I'm not surprised by that (laughter).  In Virginia, they live in Virginia, oh, yes, I'm not surprised by that.  So, I mean I have lots of known cousins on my mother's side.  And, but I, you know, I'm sure there are lots of people, and it's probably true of many, many African Americans today.  We just don't, we don't, we really--many of us don't know our history.
Speaker 1: Right, now, did he have a wife in addition to having this--
Speaker 2: Well, yes.  My, George actually married twice.  He, my mother was the second, from the second marriage.  And I never--nor did my mother ever talk about the first wife.  But he, she was the--he had six children from the second marriage.  But my mother did say that he was married before, and she had, she said to me that he had--she had half siblings who were as old as her mother.  So her mother was a much younger woman than he when he married her.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: 'Cause that's what she said.  She had, my mother, my father had children older than her mother was from his first marriage.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, what was your grandmother's name?
Speaker 2: Her name was Rebecca.
Speaker 1: Okay, any stories about her?
Speaker 2: No, I never, my mother never told any stories.  She told the story of her--my mother, talking about her mother now, Rebecca, told stories about the fact that she worked as a, you know, day worker, in homes.  And I do know that my mother refused to ever--we never had salt herrings growing.  She said she refused to have those because often, her mother was paid, that's how they would pay her.  And she would, that's what she ate growing up, my mother salt herrings 'cause the people, white people would pay her in salt herrings.
Speaker 1: So they paid her in fish?
Speaker 2: Fish, paid her with fish, and so she refused.  We never, we never had any, any salt fish growing up.  I finally, found-- I discovered I liked salt fish, but we never had them 'cause my mother said she refused to have salt herrings 'cause that's how she was, my mother--her mother had been paid for a day's work often.  That was the pay, and she had to bring that back to feed her family.
Story_ID: 25052
Speaker 1: You were saying earlier that your mother [Alice Matthews Maclin] told you a lot of stories about growing up when she--are these some of the stories she told?
Speaker 2: Yes, absolutely.  These are, this is the way I've gotten these stories, absolutely.
Speaker 1: Did your mother say anything about, did she pass along any particular observations of her, you know, when she was growing up, and what things were like for her as a little girl?
Speaker 2: Yes, she did.  My mother was born in, as I said, in 1906.  One of the things that she said, they, school for her, growing up, was about three months, you know.  And my mother actually got an education because she--the only education available to Colored people in the county was up to grade seven.  And so she finished all the public education that was available to blacks at the time.  And she said, we only went to school about three months to the year.  And my mother was a, could actually say her alphabets backwards and forwards.  She said they spent the whole first year doing that.  That's all they learned.  But she knew it backwards and forwards.  So they knew, whatever she learned, she learned it very thoroughly.  And so, so growing up for my mother was quite, was difficult.  I mean she grew up on the farm.  She said I had to, she went on occasions with her mother, her mother, to help milk the cows in the morning before she'd go to school.  And, and so they had a pretty--it was not easy, I'd say.  She was a--you want me to talk about my mother now, go ahead?
Speaker 1: Well, sure, yeah.
Speaker 2: And she, so she went to school three months to the year.  And she finished the seventh grade which was all that was available.  But she had a very, I guess if there had been opportunities for my mother, she would clearly have become a Botanist because I don't know how she learned this, but she was, she knew, partly I think from catalogs that she would read or from, on plants.  But she knew the common name and the Latin name for probably a thousand plants.  And I have no idea how she learned the Latin names because she might have learned some Latin in the school.  But it's probably not nearly enough, but she could actually tell you.  And I've, I used to spend lots of time with her in the garden growing up, and she knew all the--she knew a lot about plants.
Speaker 1: That's remarkable.  That's--
Speaker 2: It is very remarkable.  It was, it was, I was just astonished how much mother knew about plants.  And she was a very good, excellent gardener as well.
Speaker 1: So you don't know if she had any--
Speaker 2: Well, she didn't have any formal--
Speaker 1: --tutelage from anybody in terms of that?
Speaker 2: No, I don't.  She didn't have any formal training.  I do know that.  She might have learned--and I do know that growing up, we always got catalogs from almost all of the places that sell plants.  And my mother would, she had, she would get angry at the plants if they didn't do what she wanted to do.  She said plants are supposed to bloom or they're supposed to give off fruit.  If they don't do that, then they don't, they're not doing their purpose.  Their purpose, that was her view.  And she had, we always had lots of plants, lots of plants.  The porch was full of plants, the house, all around.  We had three sides of the house was plants.
Speaker 1: Now, did she, I know in recent years people have discussed doing gardening where you set certain plants out that actually drive away pests and that sort of thing.  Did she know how to do that?
Speaker 2: Well, yes, my mother had, not only--she also did plants with sort of a sense of humor.  The, all of the, growing up, all of the plants with, like the snake plant and other plants, she would put those on the front of the--that was always in the front of all the plants.  So no children, if children would come, they would get, they would get stuck.  And so they wouldn't bother her plants again.  So she did this with a sense of humor, and I said, 'cause she, that kept away--and she also knew a lot about how to keep pests away and other things.  We never had any real issues with the flowers in terms of bugs and all on them.  I guess there were a few bugs, but we didn't have that problem.  We did use, for the actually, the big garden, for the food, we had, always had a huge garden.  We did use a dust, a dust that had some kind of--
Speaker 1: Insecticide?
Speaker 2: --insecticide.  But that was, that was the only thing that--so we were doing really organic gardening, long before it was popular.
Story_ID: 25053
Speaker 1: Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: My father's full name was Otis, O-T-I-S, Armstead, A-R-M-S-T-E-A-D, Maclin, M-A-C-L-I-N.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: His date of birth was September 20, 1905.  And he was also born in, on the other side of the county, Brunswick County.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Now, I never heard my father tell stories, but I was, more than thirty years ago, I was sort of elected to do the family tree.  And as a part of that process, I started at the Brunswick County Library.  And it turns out that Brunswick County, we were very fortunate because the records in our county go back to the, the late 1600s.  Now, most counties in Virginia had been requested to send all of their records to Richmond in the 1800s.  But that message never got to Brunswick County.  So Brunswick County had this, still has, rich documents on our history.  And so I went back, and I discovered, just going through deeds, marriages and, that my paternal parents had come to, from Scotland, Richard Machling.  In fact, they spelled his name, his last name M-A-C-H-L-I-N-G.  And I found that to be extremely interesting.  But he owned a huge plantation also in the county.
Speaker 1: So that would be Machling.
Speaker 2: Machling.  And that's because, I think--and my, again, I'm postulating here, but Machling would have been, it's the German spelling, so Ling, L-I-N-G, is the, is diminutive in German.  And Mach would be power, M-A-C-H.  But that name evolved, of course, the "H" was moved and the "G" removed.  But that's, so he must have been Scottish origin and some German ancestry.  But that's the earliest.  So that was in the late, that's something like 1760s.
Speaker 1: So the name in German would be "powerlings" or something?
Speaker 2: Little power.
Speaker 1: Little power, okay.
Speaker 2: So they might have been in politics or something like that, I don't know.  But they, the name M-A-C-H-L-I-N-G, was the original spelling of my name on that paternal side.  And that, if, again postulating, it would be a little power.
Speaker 1: Yeah, is that side directly related to the white side of the Maclin's?
Speaker 2: Yes, absolutely, yes.  And, in fact, my father's people are all very, very fair skinned.  And they were also, they were freed before the Emancipation Proclamation.  And they were, my father's people were known to be a bit, using a very, a word that you don't hear very much anymore, snooty (laughter).  So, so that was, so they were freed slaves probably in the mid, probably in the 1830s, '40's [1840s], somewhere in there.
Speaker 1: So what did they do, now--
Speaker 2: They also had a--they were farmers.  For example, now, my--I never knew any of my grandparents, but the, my paternal grandparents' name would be Sarah and Clifford.  Sarah Williams Maclin and his name was Clifford which is an unusual name too.  And it's also now a family name, Clifford, C-L-I-F-F-O-R-D, were my paternal grandparents whom I never met.  But they were some of the first people in the county, I'm told, to have cars, and they had a wagon with, you know, a dressy wagon in the early 1900s when nobody else in the county had anything like that.  So they were, they were certainly--they were freed Negroes, and they also were probably, they had a farm which was--they owned and were better off than most people.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, this is a direct result of being related to the white Machling's that had the land in the first place.
Speaker 2: And land, exactly, exactly, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so I just can't--I know there's got to be some good stories related to them, I mean (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: I'm sure there are, but I have, I don't--
Speaker 1: --how they were able to negotiate that.
Speaker 2: --I do know that, you know, I had six--again, it's interesting.  I had six, my mother had six siblings.  So did my--there were six children of that family also.  My father's also has six children.  I do know, I've met, again, I come towards the end of my mother and father's marriage.  I'm the, sort of the last, next to the last child.  So not knowing any grandparents.  I didn't know any of my grandparents.  They were all dead when I was born.  And so, it's very difficult for me to say very much else, and I don't really have any stories because people didn't, they didn't talk about it.  They talked, they talked, my mother [Alice Matthews Maclin] told me these stories about her own family.  But she couldn't tell me stories about her husband's family.  I don't think she knew.
Story_ID: 25054
Speaker 1: Now, in terms of your father [Otis Maclin], did, now, did he have a chance to go to school or anything?
Speaker 2: No, he did not.  He even had less education than my mother [Alice Matthews Maclin]. I didn't, do know that he could sign his name.  I never saw my father read. My mother was reading all the time, the bible and her catalogs, plant catalogs, but I never saw my father read.  I, I do know he could sign his name, but I never saw him, growing up, reading.  And my mother was often, always reading, doing, whenever she had the time to do so.
Speaker 1: But he had land and--
Speaker 2: He had land, and he was a farmer.  And, and that's, I mean he was, my father, in some ways, inherited the heirs of his predecessors in terms of being the landowner, the way my brothers would work.  He could, he was always orchestrating the events.  He managed to figure out ways not to do a whole lot of work himself (laughter).  But he was always orchestrating everybody else working, pretty much, in lots of ways.  That was my observation.  He always had the easiest jobs in the farm, you know, the, you know, growing tobacco is a pretty--the way it was grown then.  Of course, it's now all automated.  But he always drove the tractor to bring the leaves.  He never, I never saw him actually pick the tobacco.  My brothers, older brothers and all did that or we hired people to come and help us with that.  But he always had figured out how to do the easiest jobs, it seems.  So I mean that, that was a gift.  How do you make other people work and you don't have to do very much?  So he acted, he acted in some ways like the landowner of his parents and others.
Speaker 1: The ancestors--
Speaker 2: Yeah, exactly.
Speaker 1: --who had owned the land, yeah, okay.
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: So supervisor.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was the supervisor.  That's a good name for it, that's a very good name.  He was the supervisor.
Speaker 1: So, now, is there, did he have any stories about growing up that he shared with you at all?
Speaker 2: Not really, not, no.  I didn't have the greatest of relations with my father.  And my mother in lots of ways protected me from him.  And I mean I don't think he liked me very much because, you know, I have four older sisters, I mean three older sisters, one sister younger than me.  And I do know that my sister, who in fact, Julia, who just died was his absolute favorite.  But he, when I, when I would--I always did very well in school.  And I wasn't interested in the stuff that my sisters had been interested in before me.  I was very--my mother always said, Arlene, you're different.
Story_ID: 25055
Speaker 1: Okay, now, when you consider your parents' [Alice and Otis Maclin] personalities, their dispositions, their inclinations, their habits, and how they walked, talked and looked, who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: Absolutely, my mother.  There's no doubt about that.  I have her work ethic.  I have her--my mother had a very keen sense of humor, and she used things, you know, you didn't even know it was coming on you.  And she, she was a great storyteller, I think.  I learned all of these things much later, really, after my father died, frankly, I got to really know my mother in some ways because growing up, she was always working.  She was working on the farm.  She worked, she was the first to get up in the morning at 4:00 o'clock and the last to go to bed at 9:00, every day.  And so, and that was all the time that I was at home growing up.  And then, of course, later on, after my father died, I got--I would come home.  I was still the only sibling who was single.  So I was, I became the caretaker, and I really grew to know my mother in her later years.
Speaker 1: Okay, you say your father was kind of distant and--
Speaker 2: Yes, I was not, clearly not my father's favorite (laughter), 'cause I had different aspirations, I think.
Story_ID: 25056
Speaker 1: Okay, now, there's a story about your birth that's really remarkable.  So tell us about that.  Now, you didn't know at the time, but you've been told what happened when you were born.
Speaker 2: Yes, well, when I was born, I was born with crooked feet.  In fact, it was called club feet.  My feet were turned in like this.  And I'm told that the midwife, Ms. Watkins--who was the midwife for everybody in the county--people had their children at home, said that something's wrong with these baby's feet.  And so my mother [Alice Maclin] didn't, I mean she'd had eight children before me.  She didn't pay a lot of attention.  She was busy, I was born in June.  It was during the height of the growing season.  So she didn't pay a whole lot of attention to it.  But in my third month, my aunt on my father's side, Aunt Nanny, or we called her Ann Nanny came to visit to see the new baby.  She said to my parents, something is really wrong with this child's feet.  You need to do something about it.  So as a result of that, I was taken to St. Phillip's Hospital in Richmond.  That's where she lived.  And this was the children's hospital.  And I was the first child to be operated on in the State of Virginia for club feet.  In fact, I was operated on nine times to straighten my feet out.  And these operations occurred from the, from three months until about four and a half years old.  So I was in and out of the hospital.  Most of my time was spent, in fact, in the hospital, in casts.  I would come home only rarely.  My, and my parents, you know, that was sixty five miles away.  Richmond was a long ways for them.  So my Aunt Nanny who lived in Richmond came, I'm told, to the hospital fairly frequently.  But really, growing up that first four and a half, five years, my friends became the nurses in the hospital.  They taught me how to read.  I had children's blocks.  I don't know who gave me these things, but I had--I do remember when I was about five and I was coming home for the final time from the hospital, I had these--they were blue, sort of blue and white, big cushiony blocks.  I had ABC blocks.  I had a few comic books.  And books were not something we had a whole lot of growing up at my house.  And so I had all of this stuff, and my, a woman, in fact, who lived about a mile and a half from us, Mrs. Taylor, Martha Syndor Paige Taylor was my--she named me.  So I was her godchild in a way.  So not having had any grandparents, Mrs. Taylor became my grandmother of sorts for me.  And so I admired her greatly.  And she was a woman who had married late in life.  She never had children.  So I became sort of a, her special child.  And I loved the times that I spent with her.  I think of them very fondly still because she had things that we didn't have in our house.  We had, she had come from Boston [Massachusetts], and had worked as the housekeeper for a very wealthy family, I'm told.  And so her house was, had all of the things that I dreamed that I might have one day.  She had a house full of antiques and beautiful silverware, and which we used almost--she didn't put her silverware up on the pedestal.  She actually used it, and so she, I think in some ways certainly gave me my sense of taste in terms of--and she was sort of, I just loved Mrs. Taylor. I would go and spend lots of time at her house because she had books. She taught me games.  She taught me Chinese checkers, Parcheesi, she had all of these things.  So she was the perfect mate for me as a child. And so here this woman who was in her, she had to be in her sixties when I got to know her, really became my playmate and godmother.  And so she in lots of ways served as the surrogate grandparent that I did not have.
Speaker 1: Her name again is?
Speaker 2: Martha, M-A-R-T-H-A, Syndor, S-Y-N-D-O-R, Paige, P-A-I-G-E, which was her maiden name, Taylor, T-A-Y-L-O-R.  She was a very fascinating woman.  She also, again, was a woman who you could not, if you just saw her, you could not distinguish her from a white woman.  So she, and she had come from Boston.  So she brought a lot of class to the whole county.  In fact, she had a little country store.  That's what her husband, who was a farmer, built for her to keep her busy, 'cause there was really no reason--her store was a mile and a half off the highway, off the roads.  And so (laughter), it was just, and she didn't expect to make any money on it.  And so, she had a little candy store.  She had cookies and stuff and soft drinks.  That was a real treat.  And, in fact, my younger sister and I, on Saturdays, we would get dressed up and go over to Ms. Taylor's store.  We put on our, you know, get our best and go over.  And we always had two or three cents, and she would--when we'd visit her, she would come out and come to the store.  And we would say we want a sugar cookie, a big sugar cookie, like this, and a drink, which was a drink.  She had coco drinks and stuff.  She never would take our money.  So we would come home with our money, just that we went, we went to pay for it, but we never, she never let us pay for it, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, just back to the operation for a minute.  Now, this is the first time this had ever been done in the state?
Speaker 2: Yeah, in the State of Virginia, Dr. Carpenter was the surgeon, and no one had ever been operated on for club feet in the State of Virginia because I was the guinea pig.  And so I had, you know, and growing up in some ways, I mean in retrospect, I see it as a sort of a benefit that I didn't--because I learned to read very early.  I had, my experiences even from my siblings was quite different.  And in some ways, I don't think I really ever bonded in the sense that, you know, I was, 'cause I was the kid who was away for the most part.  So, and I had the, my older sisters and brothers, I never even lived with.  I never, never--they were all gone to the Army or married before I ever, so I never lived with them.  And my younger sisters, I was always different.  I was, I didn't have anything that much in common with, and so I, and in lots, in some ways, I spent my time growing up with, as I say, my godmother, Ms. Taylor, and I spent it doing stuff that--I would, for example, when I--I became a very good and efficient worker because that was what I had to do to follow my mother.  But I also would put the few books that we had in the wheelbarrow and go into the woods.  And I learned to mimic birds.  And so I did discovery.  I did my own things, discovery in my own way.  And I guess which is what in some ways, led to my becoming a scientist because I was always interested in finding new ways to do things.  How can I do this quicker, I wanted to do it quickly, especially my chores.  I wanted to do it quickly and better.  So I would come up with ways, I can do this much more efficiently if I do it this way.  Why do you do it like this?  Why can't we come up with another strategy?  I was always asking that question.  And so my mother said, you were different.  She said, you were very different from the other children.  You were always very inquisitive.  You were always asking "why", why?  Why does this work like this?  Why can't I do it like this?  So I wanted to come up with efficient processes, especially work, and I think I, in some ways, mastered that because I became "the" child, the point person for gathering vegetables because I knew how to go into the garden, gather the vegetables, not destroy the vines and make sure that we got two or three crops from those string beans or those butter beans, rather than one, or peas.  My vines were always left, I left them clean and I could go back, and you could get--and so I became the person that my mother would choose.  She said, "Arlene, you go pick the vegetables".  You do this, you do that.  So I became, in some ways, because of that work ethic.  In lots of ways, I've maintained that throughout my life, and I learned that, I think, from my mother.

Speaker 1: Okay, can you name your brothers and sisters from the--
Speaker 2: Yes, I can.
Speaker 1: --oldest down to you?
Speaker 2: Yes, I have, George was the oldest, who just died a couple of years ago.  Then Jesse, Julia, and then Constance, Russell, Leroy, Roxie and then the one that's younger, Nanny.  So, those are the--
Speaker 1: Okay, but when you were growing up, you said like some of them had already moved out?
Speaker 2: Yes, the four oldest, George, Jesse, had, they were already in the Army.  And then they went to the Army, '45' [1945], '46' [1946].  And then Julia and Constance, my oldest sisters had gotten married really before I knew.  So I never lived with them.  And then the others, the other four, Russell on down, I lived with.
Speaker 1: Okay, so when you grew up, the household consisted of you and your--
Speaker 2: Me and my mother [Alice Matthews Maclin] and father [Otis Maclin], and then Russell, Leroy, Roxie, me and Nanny, five children.  The others had not, I never lived with them.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So my mother had children for twenty two years.  So that's, so it's a twenty two-year span, between the oldest and the youngest.
Story_ID: 25058
Speaker 1: Now, can you describe the house you grew up in?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was a, we had a front porch that my mother [Alice Matthews Maclin] had all of her flowers on, and you'd walk into the house into the living room.  There were no halls in the house.  It was a, and the living room and then to the left was a dining room.  And then behind that was a big kitchen which spanned the whole back of the house.  And then on the right side, when you walked back, walked back from the living room to the, my mother and father's bedroom, and then there was a, stairs that went upstairs.  And there were two, two rooms.  One for the girls and one for the boys (laughter), pretty much.  So there were two bedrooms upstairs.  So that was the house.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So typical farmhouse with shingles on the sides.
Speaker 1: Now, did your parents own the house--
Speaker 2: Yeah, we lived on a--
Speaker 1: --you said your father owned the land, so--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, but it was not a fancy house.  In fact, the old house which I actually was born in was a--and it was torn down more recently, but most of my life it was there.  It was the old house that had a, it was really part of the old house.  It was just boards, you know, weathered boards, and it had, what was left when I grew up was a porch.  And we could jump from our porch down to this porch and there was a, two rooms, one room downstairs and one room upstairs.  And my mother tells the story of the older, one of my older brothers who married, he brought his wife there, and they stayed there for six months or so in that space.
Story_ID: 25059
Speaker 1: What are some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Oh, the smells of one of the, my favorite smells I think, is in the summer we always had lots of apples.  And so we dried the apples on top of the smokehouse.  We'd have these sheets that we'd put these, slice these apples--that was one of my jobs to--we'd slice the apples.  And we would put them on to the top of the smokehouse to dry.  And in the wintertime, when I would come home from school, my mother would have made these magnificent, I can still, I can smell them already almost, magnificent apple puffs that she'd have on the back of the stove, ready for us to come in from school to eat.  That was one of the smells.  But just the smell and the fragrances of Spring.  You know, we had flowers all over, and just the smell of all the flowers in the Springtime and the, almost the transformation of the earth.  You know, the greening, everything just--and even wildflowers.  We had lots of wildflowers.  You could walk down almost anywhere and you could pick up pussy willows, you could pick up almost anything.  We could, we could, when I grew up, we could actually go out  on--this is before they started spraying with DDT [dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane], and we could go out and actually pick buckets of blackberries or raspberries or even wild strawberries.  You could pick wild strawberries along the roads and almost anywhere in the woods, you could go and pick all these things.  So it was a whole different America.  I mean growing up, as I look back on it, I'm really very fortunate to have grown up on a farm.  I didn't think so growing up, you know, necessarily, that I was really lucky.  But you had, I had this whole--I felt like I had this whole world that I could discover and this discovery time was for me.  And so that's the, that really is why it's my favorite season because the whole earth just flowered, you know, had all these beautiful things.  You had the apple trees, the pear trees, the fig tree unfurling.  The fig tree was, for us, and that's why I have a fig tree in my backyard now.  It's, it was like the tree, it was the go-tree.  My mother used this tree, this fig tree for, as our medicine, because I, almost never, after the operations, never went to the doctor.  She would, she used the--in some ways, she was a, and I don't know how she learned all these things, medicine man.  But the fig tree was the tree, for example, if we got an insect bite, we'd go to the fig tree and we'd put the milk of the leaf on the sting.  And the sting would go away, for burns, the sting would go away.  She would wrap, she would take the fig leaf, and she would put red clay and vinegar, and she'd make a pad, for example, for boils.  And they would come to a head.  She had all these magnificent things that she did.  And I have no idea where she learned them.  But it was just indigenous, it was indigenous knowledge that she had.  And so Spring is really clearly, my favorite season.  It really is, it has to be.  I always also, growing up, I also had a garden that my mother would help me with.  And I got a number of 4-H Club, you know, citations for the best garden for a twelve-year old, the best garden for a ten-year old or whatever.  So that, so the Spring is clearly the favorite.  And the smells of Spring.
Speaker 1: Okay, any other sights, sounds and smells?
Speaker 2: Sights.  I guess, one sight that always fascinated me too was on the rare occasion when I would be outside and I would see an airplane over, over me, that was always fascinating to me.  That didn't happen very frequently, not in rural Virginia.  But it happened enough for me to, I was--whenever I saw it, I was always amazed.  And I would just stand there for a few minutes and watch that.  Other smells, well, you know, you had the smells of the various, of the hogs that were far away.  I didn't like that smell very much.  But I fed them, and then we had the chicken house.  We cleaned that, so you had the--the smells were good and bad, I mean, you know, but most of the smells I think were associated with Spring, and I liked, I liked very much.

Speaker 1: Now, did you have a hard time, you know, walking as a little girl?
Speaker 2: Well, no, I didn't.  I really, well, the first five years, I had, I actually wore braces.  And when I was six years old, again, this was again, a first.  In my county, children did not have buses to pick them up to go to school, not black children.  They had to walk, they had to figure out a way to get to school, walk.  Everybody walked to the school, the local school.  Well, the first bus were established, started when I, my first year of school, elementary school.  We finally had a bus for the first time.  Again, I think that was my parents, the advocacy of my parents.  But in the 1951, the first buses in the county, for black kids, and I was one of those who got a bus for black children for the first time ever.  So I actually had rode back and forth to school on a bus.  Now, I didn't have any, at that time, I didn't have issues walking.  But I did wear special shoes, and I got teased a lot.  I mean I wore high-top shoes.  And so I got, in school, children were not very kind to me, I should say.  And so I got teased because of the kind of shoes that I wore.  And I remember those, and I, I fought back at that sometimes.  I really, my first day of school, I remember this--and this was a rural school so they had grades from one through sixth at the school--
Speaker 1: In the same room or--
Speaker 2: No, we had one, two and three in one room.  And then there was a sliding panel, four, five and six in the other room.  There were two teachers.  And so my first day of school, this big girl, she was, she must have been in the sixth grade, and I was--we had recess, and I was over there playing by myself, which I had learned to do very well.  And she came up to me, and she said, "Little girl, why aren't you playing with the rest of the children?"  And I said, "I don't want to".  And she kept insisting.  So I just picked up a stick and just hit her across the legs, and she didn't bother me anymore (laughter).  I still remember that day.  So I did, I had some, early on, I had some criticism, but I figured out how to, I found things that were equalizers.
Story_ID: 25061
Speaker 1: Now, I've read a disturbing story about your money collections--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: --you know, giving your cousins quizzes to get their pennies--
Speaker 2: Yes (laughter), yes, these were my, not my cousins.  These were my nieces and nephews.  See, my older siblings have children almost, they're only two or three years younger than me.  And so I do know my second oldest sister lived in New York.  And each summer, she would send her children, four of them, to come to stay with us during the summer.  And they had a little money, not much.  But I figured out all these games in which only I could win (laughter).  And so at the end of the game, I always won their pennies.  They had to bring their pennies.  And so I figured out these strategies to get their money.  So I was a capitalist even then, as a child growing up.  This is eight, nine years old, you know, somewhere down there.  But I figured that, how to do that.  I was very good at that 'cause I had a collection of pennies (laughter).
Story_ID: 25062
Speaker 1: Okay, I take it you liked school though?
Speaker 2: Oh, I liked, I loved school.  I loved school.  I did.  I had a, Ms. Koley who was my first, second and third-grade teacher.  And she had been the teacher for generations, several generation in the county.  She was an older teacher at that time.  But in the first grade, there was no reason for me to be in the first grade because I knew how to read.  And I knew how to tell time, and I knew my alphabets.  And so at the, when she would have--I did the first-grade work, but whenever she'd have reading or math or something with the second grade which was next to me, I always sat in the second grade 'cause I knew everything that the first graders--when I went to school I already knew the first grade.  So at the end of my first grade year, I got promoted to the third grade 'cause I had done the first and second year combined.  They were sitting next to me.  I saw no reason why I shouldn't read and do math with them.  And so I did.  I could everything that--I could do everything that the first graders, before I even got to school.  So there was no need for me to be in the first grade.  So I was promoted at the end of my first year to the third grade.  So I skipped a year.  I had some, I do remember some students would say, oh, Arlene, get back into your grade, get--some of the kids in the second, get back to your grade.  And so I said, I'm not getting back.  I know how to do this.  And so I refused to get back to my--I would just take, get out of my seat.  And there were, the seat were different.  The first grade had, we had seats with desks, and I could slide under it, which I did.  They had little individual desks.  That was the first grade section.  Then the second grade section had, we had--they sat in rows, second and third grade.  So they were two or three people would sit in the row, and you shared the same top space, and there were three or four of those.  So I would just slide out of my seat and go over to the second grade, and I sat with them when the teacher was teaching second grade.  So at the end of the first year, again, I got promoted to the third grade.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, I'm a year ahead of, I was a little bit ahead of, you know--the students who I graduated from high school with, almost all of them are a year older than me.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you started school around 1950--
Speaker 2: Fifty one [1951].
Speaker 1: Fifty one [1951], so you were six then.
Speaker 2: You had to be six years old.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They didn't have kindergarten (laughter).  They didn't have any kindergarten.  So you had to be six years old.  So I was right for six.  I had a June birthday, so I was the perfect time for, to start at, on my sixth year.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you said you were fascinated by the natural world in the--
Speaker 2: Yes, I was always, I was always fascinated by that, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, in the fifth grade, did they skip you again, or did you stay--
Speaker 2: No, I was not skipped again.  I, I went from, I spent the first six years, six grades--five years at that Hickory Run Elementary School, which was right down from the church.  And it was called, and that we lived in the part of the county called Hickory Run, the Hickory Run section of the county.  Brunswick County happens to be land wise, the second largest county in the State of Virginia.  So we had, this county is actually developed--is separated into districts.  So I was in the Hickory Run District, and then at the end of the sixth grade, I went to--and that changed my life, really.  I went to Rawlins Elementary School for the seventh grade.  And I met my first great teacher and mentor, Maude Mays.  She changed my life.  She really did.
Speaker 1: What's her name?
Speaker 2: Maude, M-A-U-D-E.
Speaker 1: Maude, okay.
Speaker 2: Mays, M-A-Y-S.  But she changed my life because I had been, especially in the fourth, fifth and sixth grade, I was pretty much, I was disruptive because I wasn't learning anything in school.  I had a, the world's worst teacher.  And I wasn't learning anything.  And I was bored.  So I was always getting into, doing things I was in "not supposed to be into".  And so, and I was doing that of, and now in retrospect, because of the frustration.  But when I got to seventh grade, Mrs. Mays saw my talent, and she challenged me, and she gave me extra work.  She gave me, I mean she was just a fabulous teacher.  And she's the kind of teacher that every student should have.  She was my first, I would say, other than my mother [Alice Matthews Maclin], Mrs. Mays was my first great teacher.  I've had a number of people who've mentored me since, but she was my first great teacher in school, formal teacher.  And then I've met a number since that.
Story_ID: 25063
Speaker 1: All right, so we were talking about your teacher.
Speaker 2: Maude Mays.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Maude Mays.
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, she challenged me.  I was, I really--that was a very, very productive year for me.  And all the reports that my parents had been getting about my being disruptive in third, fourth and--well, it would be the fourth, fifth and sixth grades, disappeared 'cause you never heard any more.  I never, she was just, she kept me busy.  She gave me things to do.  She was interesting.  And she was challenging.  So I was challenged.
Speaker 1: Now, did she teach science at all?
Speaker 2: No, she didn't teach science.  It was, again, it was just an elementary school.  But she taught, well, they had the normal science that you would have, but the math.  She was good at math, but we had all the subjects, the science.  I don't even remember what science we might have had in the seventh grade.  But it wasn't, she wasn't--she was just an elementary school teacher.  She was not a specialist in any area.  But I do know that she gave me challenging things to read and to, the math, I was challenged by that.  She knew I was interested in mathematics.  And so she gave me extra work.  So I was challenged, and I kept very busy.  I was just so fascinated that here, this person would take time to introduce me to things that I had no idea about before.  So she was a great teacher.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, in fact, her daughter is a teacher here in the Vineyard, just got a award several years ago.
Speaker 1: Here in Washington [D.C.]?
Speaker 2: She's in the Washington area.  She teaches in some school in Virginia.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I saw the award in the newspaper.  But she was a, she was just a naturally, just a great teacher, one of my memorable ones and mentor.
Speaker 1: Okay, this is seventh grade, right?
Speaker 2: Seventh grade, seventh grade, changed my life.  I think it changed my whole path.  I probably, had I not had her, would not have been--'cause I was, you know, I didn't have anybody to guide me academically, necessarily, 'cause my parents couldn't do that.  And she did that.  She was the first to give me that direction in terms of academics.  These are the things you need to be doing.  This is what you should be reading, that kind of thing.
Story_ID: 25064
Speaker 1: And there's one story that I didn't tell.  In rural Virginia, we didn't have books at home, but there was what was called the Book Mobile that would come around in the summertime for schools.  And it only came every two weeks.  And you were only allowed to get three books.  And I knew the schedule.  So I made it, in the summertime, I made it my, it was on my schedule to just meet the Book Mobile.  And it would stop there at the turn, at our turn, and I would go and get my three books that I would read maybe two or three times by the time it came back.  And I had to turn those in and get three more.  So that was a service, and that must have started when I was about ten, I would say nine or ten years old, and for rural Virginia kids.  And so the Book Mobile would come.  I would meet the Book Mobile and get my books and move, 'cause the only library in the county, public library was in Lawrenceville, which was eighteen miles away.  That was a long ways away.  So there were no libraries in our rural, little Rawlins.  There were no, there's no library there.
Speaker 2: Now, did you have favorite books in grade school?
Speaker 1: Did I have favorite books?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All I wanted to do was to read.  I don't remember necessarily the books, but I do know whatever I could get to read, I loved that.  I would read whatever.  We got one, growing up, we got one--other than the catalogs for plants, we got one magazine, and it was called 'The Progressive Farmer.'  And I read the 'Progressive Farmer,' that was a monthly.  I don't even think it's--I would read that from cover to cover, and whenever it came.  Of course, that got the, there was not a whole lot of paper around because catalogs, you know, we used those for the outdoor privy.  So you know where all those would go.  So there's no set or anything.  So (laughter) that's the way they were, that was their final resting place.
Speaker 2: They were basically toilet paper.
Speaker 1: Yes (laughter).  That's what they became.  So you got the, you read it as soon as it came in.  Otherwise, you probably wouldn't get a chance to do that.
Speaker 2: Okay, so your family didn't get any of the newspapers like 'Norfolk Journal'--
Speaker 1: No, we didn't get, we didn't get the 'Journal' growing up.  We didn't get any newspapers.  We didn't, we didn't have any money to do--that was, that would have been a frivolous way of spending your money.  No, we got the one thing, the 'Progressive Farmer.'  That was the only magazine I remember coming other than the catalogs, the plant catalogs, and, of course, we got Spiegel and Sears catalogs.  So everybody got catalogs.
Speaker 2: Was radio and television important growing up?
Speaker 1: Well, let me tell you.  Radio, I listened to the radio.  I do remember listening to the radio on Saturdays.  I listened when I could get the radio to myself.  That was not a whole lot.  I listened occasionally to the Metropolitan Opera.  During the week, the radio, my parents, there were--and I never was interested in these, but our breaks from being out in the fields, harvesting the tobacco, they would rush home for, there were soap operas on radio.  I don't, because I wasn't interested in soap operas.  And never, still not interested in soap operas.  But we did get a television.  We were, in fact, we got a television in the, probably in the mid-'50's [1950s].  We were one of the first people, first families to get a television.  And I don't know what year it was, probably '53' [1953], '54' [1954], somewhere along there.  And the, I do remember there was only one channel.  That was Channel 6, Richmond Channel 6, and it, my father, not my mother, my father would look at it until it went off.  It would go off at 11:00 o'clock at night.  She never stayed up, but, and so--and people from around, we had, you know, would come to our house to look at this--I think the television only went from 7:00 to 11:00 at night.  That was the programming in the early times.
Speaker 2: Now, how big was the screen?
Speaker 1: Oh, it was, you know, it was small, but it had a--it had a small screen, but it was a big, it was a piece of furniture.  You know, you had all these electronics, and so it was a piece of furniture in the living room.  It became the, so it was heavy and a piece of furniture.  It was a big thing with the voice box, I guess at the bottom, and the screen was not that big, very small, probably eight to nine inches or something like that, very small compared to what people have today, what most people have.
Story_ID: 25065
Speaker 1: Can you remember when you first got your first formal science instruction in school?
Speaker 2: I would have to say it was eighth grade.  I would have to say, in terms of it being a separate subject that I remember.  I really was, in high school--high school for us was from eighth grade to twelfth grade.  So that's a little different from the way they do it now.  But at the end of the seventh grade, I went to what was then known as James Solomon Russell High School.
Speaker 1: James Solomon--
Speaker 2: James Solomon Russell High School.
Speaker 1: Now, who was James Solomon Russell?
Speaker 2: James Solomon Russell was a, he was an Arch Deacon in the Episcopal Church.  And he was, he taught at St. Paul's College.  St. Paul's is an Episcopal school.  So he was an Arch Deacon.  I don't know even know whether the Episcopal Church has Arch Deacons again, now, but anyhow, he was an Arch Deacon.  And he was an educator, known as an educator in the county.  So this school, the first school for blacks, which was built in 1950.  There were no high schools for blacks in Brunswick County until 1950.  And so the, this first, the first black high school built.  And this was built because of the, you know, the anti, the segregationists in the State of Virginia.  So they decided they'd build high schools all over that part of Virginia to try to stop integration.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was to satisfy the separate, but equal.
Speaker 2: Absolutely, that was what it was for.  So the first high school for black or African Americans in Brunswick County was built in 1950 and it was named for him.
Speaker 1: Because previously, they had, they had not provided the schools that they (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: They hadn't--well, let me just tell you.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: In Brunswick County, what happened was St. Paul's had a high school, but you had to pay for that.  And my, I had two of my older siblings actually went to the high school that St. Paul's College provided.  But they had to pay money.  And so there was very little to, for us to--so my older siblings didn't, one finished the tenth grade, and the first one, Russell, finished James Solomon Russell in 1955.  But before that, the older siblings couldn't--you had to pay to go to school, so they couldn't go to school.  And St. Paul's was the only high school that students in the county got.  And they had been doing that for a large of, long time.  St. Paul's had been--and that was not, that was typical of many black colleges.  They were the high schools in these counties for black children.  And, of course, there was nominal pay.  I don't have any idea how much they had to pay, but it was a lot of money.  And, for example, I do remember my parents--this is a story that, this is 1954, when my parents were studying.  They had to study.  They had to learn and memorize the Constitution of the United States to vote in Brunswick County.  My parents were, again, some of the first to do that.  And I remember sitting at the dining room table for two, maybe two to three months, reading line-by-line, the Constitution.  And my parents reciting the Constitution so that they could qualify to vote.  And then they had to pay on top of being able to recite the Constitution at any point for the literacy test, they also had to pay poll tax of $11.00 each to vote in 1954.
Speaker 1: Just for the record, white people didn't have to do it.
Speaker 2: No, white people did not have to do it.  Black people had to prove their literacy and the literacy test in my county was the Constitution.  And then they had a tax that they had to pay to vote, $11.00, and that's each time.  So there was poll tax and the literacy test, only for blacks.  White people did not have to do that.
Speaker 1: So needless to say, black people were discouraged from--
Speaker 2: They were, yes, absolutely.  And were, absolutely.  They were--I do remember our little country church had, they had a drive.  And, of course, my parents being very active in the church, they became some of the first to do that, to qualify.  And it was quite an honor to qualify to vote in our own country in Brunswick County in 1954.  But that's when, but that was the first time that they voted.
Speaker 1: So they really sacrificed to--
Speaker 2: Yeah, absolutely.  That was a big, that was a big amount of money, $11.00 each to vote.  That was a lot of money.
Story_ID: 25066
Speaker 1: That's when, say, monthly income would have been what?
Speaker 2: Well, we didn't have monthly income.  We, our income was from the tobacco.  So we had a, we got paid once a year, at the end of the crop.  So you had to figure out how to make that last until, so, so October, November and probably early December, you take your tobacco to the market, and you'd get paid for that.  And so you had to figure out how to make sure you managed to, your money from that time until the next year, October.
Speaker 1: The family, otherwise, lived off the land, right?
Speaker 2: We lived off the land.  I mean I don't, I rarely--we had everything.  We had plenty to eat.  We grew all of our food.  We had a freezer in which, again, if the year was good, we would buy, my father would buy a side of beef, as he called it.  And we'd put that in the freezer, and we had beef all year long.  We had pigs, and we had the wildlife.  We had, I didn't--my father didn't kill coons, but my very best friend, Nanny Mills, whom I grew up with and we were inseparable almost from first grade to twelfth grade, her family were really avid hunters.  And I would go there.  We had coon, and we'd have all the deer.  They had all the wildlife that was available in the county.  And so, so that's what people ate.  They managed.  We had, and we had plenty.  My uncle, my mother's uncle, raised wheat.  And each year, he would bring his sister, my mother, two, 200 [pound] bags of flour.  And so that was our, so we didn't have to buy flour.  We bought very little, frankly.  We didn't have to buy--the treat, when my parents would go on Saturdays and come back--we never went, the children didn't go.  That was their time.  She would bring back, and this was a treat, Chef Boyardee's spaghetti in the can (laughter).  Now, you can imagine that being a treat, but that was--she didn't have to cook Saturday night supper.  So, but other than that, most of our food was, we grew it.  We grew everything.  We were self sufficient for the most part during the year.  We didn't buy anything.  We had no need.  And it was all fresh stuff.  I mean, you know, so, you know, we canned.  My mother canned.  We, when we got the freezer, we froze stuff, food.  We preserved, dried apples.  So we were very self sufficient, no need to go to the store to buy anything.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 25067
Speaker 1: Now, was church a big part of growing up?
Speaker 2: Yes, it was, it was.  It was--I didn't particularly like church, but it was a part of my, as I told you, my parents, that was their social life.  And I came, only came to realize that much later.  But I did all the things that children do in church.  I was the, I was in the Junior Missionary.  And I typically was the representative for a couple of year, I was the representative--this was a Baptist church, representative for the, for my church to these summer things they would have.  And it was very different because they would have these summer conventions.  And what happened was, during that time, you would actually go to people's, you would go to the convention.  But you lived with people.  You lived with church people at the other place.  And so you got to meet interesting people.  And then at these missionaries, I think I was the representative one or two years.  And I went to some place else in Virginia.  It was away from the, away from my little county.  And you met people who were higher up in the church.  And I was also the secretary for the Sunday school when I was a teenager, sixteen, seventeen, eighteen until I went off to college.  So, yes, it was, we were very--and I was also, I think I sang in the junior choir.  So we had to be engaged.  So, yeah, it was a big, but I, but when I got rid of, when I finished high school, I said, church.  I do not need to do this ever again.  So, college, I didn't do it (laughter).  I gave it up (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, now, did you have a--I mean you're a scientific, I mean you're a scientist--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --a top scientist now.  I mean did you have, did you see contradictions between the teachings of the church in terms of explanations for--
Speaker 2: We didn't have that kind of educated discussion.  I mean it was just, we had--it was a country church.  So we had, the man had, he had twelve sermons.  We met once a month for church, and then Sunday school.  So it was not that kind of controversy in the church in terms of Darwin's Theories or any of that.  It was not at that level, no.  But I went because I had to go.  That was the reason I--it was part of what I had to do.  I mean we, growing up, we didn't have, children didn't have a whole lot of choices.  You could figure out ways to do things that you wanted to do, but in terms of my mother coming to me and saying, Arlene, would you like to do this today, that would never happen.  That was just not the time, it didn't, that kind of stuff didn't happen.  And I see the permissiveness now that people have with their children is unbelievable.  But we didn't have those kinds of choices, and we had--I think in some ways, it was a good thing because I don't think children are able to make those kinds of major decisions that current parents allow them to make.  I don't really think they have the maturity or to understand even the finances of their family, to make the kind of sacrifices that many people still are making for their children.  And I think, frankly, again, I guess, I must say, I don't have children.  But I teach other people's children.  But the point is, I think some of the permissiveness that parents allow is a bit, way out there, in my thinking.

Speaker 1: James Solomon Russell High School, and do most people pronounce the whole thing when they--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, we always say James Solomon Russell, yeah, we all, yeah--the other thing you must remember, most people and many people have double names.  And we don't drop the double name.  Like I have a cousin Queen Esther.  We say Queen Esther.  We don't Queen or Jean Esther.  We don't say Jean.  We say, Jean Esther.  We use the whole name, the whole name.  My brother was George Albert.  We always called him George Albert.  We never just said, George.  So this is just a common practice and people who had double names, we said the whole name.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, as a rule.
Speaker 1: Now, was there, did you have a favorite teacher in high school?
Speaker 2: Oh, absolutely, absolutely.  My favorite teacher in high school was my math teacher, Johnnye Thompson, J-O-H-N-N-Y-E, Thompson, T-H-O-M-P-S-O-N.  She's got to be my world's favorite.  And I'll tell you why.  She just died a couple of years ago.  But in the eighth grade, I was, I was in the--I didn't realize it at the time, but I was in what was called the Terminal Track.  That meant that I was not going to, I was not gonna be prepared to go to college.  I was just gonna take regular courses and go get a trade or something like that.  So I was in the college prep.  And I didn't realize this until the ninth grade.  And I was, I took--I did not take her math in the eighth grade.  But in the ninth grade, I took her Algebra class.  And she asked, she asked the question, "Why are you in this class"?  I was with the terminal group.  She said, why are you in this class?  And I said, I don't know.  And she said, you're not going to stay in this class.  And she took me out of that class the same day.  And she said, I'm going to, you're--I want you to come to me each semester to get your--we didn't have counselors in this high school.  I want you to come to me every, the beginning of every semester, and I will help you put your schedule together.  And all of a sudden, I began taking classes with a whole nother group of students.  They were not even, none of the students who were in my eighth class, did I have any more classes with.  And it was Johnnye Thompson that really, again, she was my--she saved my life.  She's the one who really made me--at that time in  the seventh, eighth and ninth grade, I just knew I wanted to do mathematics.  I loved mathematics.
Speaker 1: Now, was there a reason for, how were your grades going forward?  I mean why do you think you were in that lower track?
Speaker 2: Well, I can tell you why.  I was in that lower track not because I didn't have good grades.  I was in that lower track because I came from the wrong part of the county.  I came from Rawlins, the farm part of the county, me and my friend, Nanny Miles, were--you know, it's a rural county.  But even the county had its, what do I, how do I say this?  They had, there was a class about what school, for example, the kids who grew up in Lawrenceville, which was a little nothing town and the kids who grew up in Freeman because of their teacher, Reverend Byrd, they were the favorites.  And they were in the--tracking was not necessarily based on your grades.  It was based on where you came from in the county.  So I was from the wrong part of the county to be in the bright group.  And so it is Johnnye Thompson who, when I took her, started taking her Algebra class, and she saw how well I was doing, she said, why are you in this group?  And I had no clue that our school even had a tracking system.  They had a terminal track, which meant that you were not being prepared to go to college.  And then they had a college preparatory.  There were two tracks.  And I had no idea that there was tracking at all.  And I didn't have parents, again, who could advise me on what classes to take.  So I was, in the eighth grade, I was in all the wrong classes.  I was, again, after having five and the seventh grade, then moving to this eighth grade, I was put in these classes, not because of my grades 'cause I had good grades.  It was because of my, of where I came from in the county, Rawlins.  That was not, that was not exactly the favorite part of the county 'cause we were mostly farmers, and we didn't have parents of influence in the county.
Story_ID: 25069
Speaker 1: Okay, so were you able to take like trigonometry and that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, I took, well, I took Algebra I and II.  I took Geometry.  I took Trigonometry.  We had bullion Algebra.  I had a--Ms. Thompson was a fabulous, again, a fabulous teacher who every summer--let me tell you about her.  Every summer, she would go off to these summer institutes for teachers.  And one summer, I remember this, the eleventh grade, she went to Yale [University] 'cause there were faculty institute.  This is now the early '60's [1960s] in which there are faculty institutes all over for high school teachers.  And she took advantage of all of them.  She really should have gotten her PhD, but she never did.  And she would bring the latest things back to us.  And I even had Bullion Algebra in high school which was unheard of.  And when I got to college, in fact, and I was there talking about set theory and all that.  And the, my math teacher, who was very good, Theodore Sykes, he said, where did you go to high school?  And I said, I went to James Solomon Russell.  He said, oh, yeah, I know your teacher there.  I mean so she was, she was known to produce--and scientists and mathematicians.  And, in fact, a large number of our class, was 1963, most, many of them went into science and math, large numbers of students went into science, biology, mathematics.  I don't know about how many went into physics, but I did.  But anyhow, she was a great influence to large numbers of students, just a fabulous, again, an absolutely marvelous teacher, one of the best.  You couldn't find a better teacher.
Speaker 1: Now, did you have science equipment at James Solomon Russell?
Speaker 2: We had some.  We had a chemistry lab.  And we had a biology laboratory.  I took, again, in ninth grade, I took biology, and I didn't particularly like biology.  And then I took, tenth grade, I took chemistry.  The eleventh grade I took my first physics.  And I, the physics course, let me just say, the physics course in high school was not terribly good.  It was really not a good class.  But for the first time in my life, in eleventh grade, I figured out how I could use mathematics.  I said, this is what I do with the math.  That was the first, that was sort of a eureka moment.  I didn't realize--I knew I liked mathematics, but I didn't know how I would ever use it, what practical applications could I make of it?  And physics, in the eleventh grade, showed me that.  And so that was my, in eleventh grade, I think I made up my mind that I wanted to be a physicist.  I'm pretty sure, even though our physics was not the best of physics courses.  I decided that that's what I wanted to do 'cause it just opened up my eyes to so many things.  And this is how I use this mathematics.  I liked mathematics, but I didn't know how I was gonna ever use it, what practical use, and being from the farm, I'm always looking for practical applications.  What practical use would I ever make of this mathematics, and the physics demonstrated that that was, that that was the way to do that.

Speaker 1: Now, while you're in school, the Civil Rights Movement is kind of raging around--
Speaker 2: It's raging.
Speaker 1: What was going on in--
Speaker 2: Well, in Brunswick County, I mean not a whole lot.  I mean you must know that people were scared.  So there was not anything going--let me just tell you, it was, not much was going on in my own county.  But one of the reasons I chose--of course, it's on television, and we knew about it.  One of the reasons I chose to go to Greensboro to college was because I knew that was the--they were in the height of it.  And when I got to North Carolina A and T [North Carolina Agricultural and Technical University] in the fall of 1963, things were raging.  I saying the sit-in's had already started, but Greensboro was wide open.  I mean, you know, black people could go to restaurants, couldn't do that in Brunswick County, still.  You couldn't do any of that.  You couldn't go to a restaurant.  You couldn't go to a hotel, not in my part of the county.  But in Greensboro I actually went to my first restaurant.  That was the first time I'd ever gone to a restaurant in my life.  That was the first, freshman year in college.
Speaker 1: That's 1963?
Speaker 2: Nineteen, fall of 1963.  So Greensboro is wide open.
Story_ID: 25071
Speaker 1: Now, is there anything about high school graduation that's notable before we move on to college?
Speaker 2: Well, in high school, I was not the most popular person in high school.  I was, I finally joined this, I guess this elite group of students in our high school, which was about, I would say, thirty or forty students, all of whom were, their ambition was to go on to college.  There were about 135 students who graduated in my high school.  Eighth grade, there was something like 270 students starting.  So about half of us graduated from high school.  But all of the, the group that I got placed in, in the ninth grade was, were all college bound.  And I was glad to be a part of that group.  I was in the Honor Society in high school.  I was in the, I was in the Latin Club and the math, the Science and Math Club.  We had a Science and Math Club.  I don't know that we did anything particular.  Oh, I do know we did things in particular.  We, the Science and Math Club, and I did this for three years.  I went to--at that time, in the State of Virginia, there were annual state science and math competitions for all of the black children.  And so I know I went to the--and these, the competitions were held typically at Virginia Union [College] or Virginia State [College].  So that was a big trip for us, to go to the--and so we competed on our, in the local high school level.  And then we, the students who did well on these tests, we actually had tests, would go on to the state competitions.  And I went to the state competitions for both--I won, in fact, the state competition in Geometry, and I won the state competition in Trigonometry.  So, and that was because of my math teacher.  So, and these were held in, as I said, alternate years.  One year it'd be held at Virginia Union which was in Richmond, Virginia, and the other years, it would be held at Virginia State.  So I got to meet other students from all over the state, black kids from all over the state competing in science and math.  And that was a big deal, and had I not been in this group, I would not have had that kind of opportunity.  And I won twice.  So I was the, I think I won--I was the first place in Geometry, which I still love, and I think I was the second place in Trigonometry.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: In high school.
Story_ID: 25072
Speaker 1: So you said you would have gone to Bennett College, but you decided to go on to A and T [North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University]--
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, I got a call--let me tell you.  I got admitted into Bennett College and then I also qualified--I didn't know this, in fact, I qualified for a state scholarship because of my club feet.  And the State of Virginia told me that I could not go to a, I could not go to Bennett College because it was private and church supported.  I had to go to a public school to accept the scholarship.  In fact, and I actually wrote a letter to President Kennedy protesting this.  I got a response.  I don't know where that response is, but I wrote a letter in protest.  But then I made the decision, I said, well, if--and then I, as I did more research, I discovered that Bennett did not have a major in physics.  And if I wanted to major in physics, I would have to go to North Carolina A and T in any case.  So I said, well, it can't be that bad.  It's across the railroad track.  So that's the way I discovered, I really went to North Carolina A and T.  But I went, I think I was impressed by the, what was going on at Bennett College, the fact that they were, even though the history does not give it the full benefit, but Bennett College was really very instrumental in the sit-in movement in Greensboro.  They were the leaders.  In fact, the president of the college was very much engaged and involved in that.  And the records don't really give them their due.  But they were really the leaders in the Movement, not A and T, the four young men who actually were engaged.  But it was the young women who went to jail and all kinds of things.  Willa Player, who was the president at that time was very progressive.
Speaker 1: Willa Player.
Speaker 2: Willa Player is her name.  Willa, W-I-L-L-A, Player, P-L-A-Y-E-R was the president of Bennett College.  And so the people, the women at Bennett were instrumental in the sit-in movement.  And she was a, in fact, and this is an aside, but she was the first college president that invited Martin Luther King [Jr.], and that was in 1958.  And they have, if you go to Bennett College, they have a statute of him.  And they have his original speech that he gave there at Bennett in 1958.
Speaker 1: That's remarkable.  I--
Speaker 2: That is remarkable.  It is remarkable, and that story is not really, has really not been told.
Speaker 1: I know we've heard other stories of other sit-in demonstrations prior to 1962.  I mean the Mitchell brothers down in--
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, there were--
Speaker 1: --Maryland, and--
Speaker 2: --it's, it was, the difference in who got recognition and who didn't was the media, you know.  And the media took on to the stories.  But there were sit-in's even in the late '20's [1920s].  I'm looking right now at this abolitionist thing on PBS, and it's extremely--it's very exciting about what happened.  I mean, it comes on on Tuesday night.  The first episode was last week, and I--it's just riveting, how interesting and how much we don't know about what was going on.  But this, of course, is the hundred and sesquicentennial of the Emancipation Proclamation.  So I guess we've learned a lot about our own history.
Speaker 1: So President Willa Player--
Speaker 2: Willa Player, at Bennett College--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --was very engaged, and she had the students from Bennett marched across the bridge, all women.  It's an all women's school, and they marched across the bridge.  They led, the North Carolina A and T young men, but North Carolina A and T was not that engaged in the sit-in movements.  Bennett was much more engaged than North Carolina A and T.
Story_ID: 25073
Speaker 1: Okay, so North Carolina A and T, now, so did you major in physics at--
Speaker 2: Absolutely.  I majored in physics.  I was a physics major, and that was the first, the first physicist that I had ever met, I met, and he became my long, life-long mentor, and who was Dr. Alexander Gardner, Alexander "Buddy" Gardner was my--I met him my freshman year.
Speaker 1: Because later on, he would be at Howard [University] too, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, he moved from A and T to Howard, yes.
Speaker 1: So his nickname was Buddy?
Speaker 2: Buddy, yeah.  That was his middle, that was his real name.  That was his middle name.
Speaker 1: Was it?  Okay, all right, his real name.
Speaker 2: His name, Alexander Buddy Gardner.  His close friends called him Buddy.
Speaker 1: Now, he is a celebrated figure--
Speaker 2: Absolutely.  He, Dr. Gardner influenced.  He was the first person, black person to get a PhD at North Carolina, University of North Carolina.  He got his degree in 1964, even though it was awarded 1965.  He had, he had finished pretty much his degree work when, and he was teaching at A and T, which is where he had graduated college.  And I met him my freshman year.  And he really influenced a whole generation of black students to do physics.  We had the, we had fifty majors under Dr. Gardner at A and T.  He also was Ron McNair's mentor.  He was the Loews' brothers mentors.  He was just, and his students went on--Elvira Shaw Williams.  I don't know whether you are interviewing her or not.  But he influenced a whole generation of young blacks to major in physics, and to do physics, and, in fact, when he finished--and he tells this story.  When he finished North Carolina, University of North Carolina as a first black to get a PhD in physics there, and he told them that what he was going to do, he said, I'm going back to North Carolina A and T, and I'm going to influence more black students to join, to study physics.  They looked at him like he was absolutely crazy.  And they said, well, why aren't you going on to do research 'cause he had done, his PhD research was in metals, cadmium, and he'd done some other--and he's a very good experimentalist.  He was a, just a magician almost in the laboratory.  And his advisors told him that he should not do that, that he should go on into a world of research.  But he decided that he really wanted to do, to teach.  He was a great teacher.  He taught, when he talked about physics, the physics sort of jumped off the page because he made physics come alive.  He related it to our lives and what we could do with it.  And he really was a master teacher, and he taught physics contextually.  And here is a man who had, again, his, growing up, his early years, he left school.  And he went and joined the Merchant Marines for several years, and then he got into--I never, he never told me what the problem was, but he got into some serious trouble and was in prison for a while.  And he, from prison, he wrote to North Carolina A and T and asked them to please admit him to college, let him come, when he got out, when he finished, whatever his--I don't know what his crime was.  He never told me.  And, but North Carolina A and T admitted him, and he became the, he graduated from North Carolina A and T as the top student, summa cum laude, with an eighth grade education.  And he actually came from New Burn, North Carolina originally.  Again, but he influenced large numbers of people in my generation to study physics.
Speaker 1: And his name is--
Speaker 2: He was a great influence.  He had, for, at one point in the '80s [1980s], more than 10 percent and there were only about, at that time, about 400 blacks with PhDs in physics, Dr. Gardener had been a mentor to forty or fifty of them.  So he was a great influence for thirty years of people going on into physics.  If you talked to many students my age and fifteen to twenty years younger, and you ask them when did you meet Dr. Gardener.  You didn't ask where.  You say, when because you know, you can tell his students.  But he was a very, very instrumental mentor for a large number of students, a very large number.  And he clearly was an influence on me, a large influence.  And, in fact, I think I was one of his favorite students.  And he was my mentor for life.
Speaker 1: Yeah, the African American physicists have erected a plaque to him--
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, absolutely.
Speaker 1: --on a couple of campuses, I think.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and he also was, in fact, after he died--he died in 2001.  I went down to Alabama with his wife, his widow, and received another--they devoted a whole session to him, and his life's work and I gave a talk about him and his influence and all that.  So, really, you know, it's amazing how you can have centers of influence.  And I call 'em that because--and he clearly, in the black physics community, I would say Dr. Gardener clearly was a center of influence for 30 years, from 1965 till 1995.  And that work was done at North Carolina A and T and at Howard [University].  He was actually recruited from A and T by President Cheek to Howard  [Howard University] 'cause he wanted him to do what he had done for physics at A and T, at Howard.  So he came to Howard.
Speaker 1: So did he establish the PhD program in physics at Howard?
Speaker 2: No, the PhD program at Howard was established in the '50s [1950s] before that.  There was a chemistry, physics, math, were all--the PhD programs were all established about the same time.  And so, no, he was, that was in the '50's [1950s] that their PhD program had actually been established at Howard.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, earlier.
Speaker 1: All right, so this, so you came along in time to meet, to have this great mentor?
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: And influence throughout my life.  In fact, I'm not a very good godmother, but I'm the godmother to his two children, two of his children, who are now grown and, but, yes, he was a life--you know, it's interesting that in my life, my mentors have also become mentors and friends and lifelong.  These are lifelong relationships that I established.  And I think that's extremely important in a student's life, that here are people that you can go to for anything.  And he was that kind of person.  I mean you could pretty much, you could go to him and tell him--it didn't have to be about school.  It could be about anything, and he would be willing to sit there and talk to you about that.  And I think that's what good mentors do.  And so mentors become friends and become collaborators and then I have this theory that mentoring is an art.  It's not, it cannot be taught.  It's really an art.  And that's what many students miss.  I tried to do that and as much as I can, and I think I've been, in some ways, a very effective mentor in that regard.  But I've learned, I learned that from the people who mentored me.  It's a learned behavior.
Story_ID: 25074
Speaker 1: Now, so, now, as a physics student at North Carolina A and T, you--did they have--what were the facilities like?  Were--(unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Well, we didn't have a whole lot of facilities.  We had, there was, we had laboratories.  Donald Edwards, whom you probably have known, knew too, was one of the, he was the generation of physicists before me, was an x-ray spectroscopist, and he had an x-ray fraction machine.  And I actually, at the end of my freshman year, was invited to stay and work in his laboratory.  The two, there were four physics students in my class.  That's a small number.  That was, I was the only woman, and then there were three other male students, no, four.  There were four.  One was in the ROTC.  There were four male students in my class of physics students.  And so Donald Edwards was the chair of the department.  Dr. Gardener, who had been his student, came to A and T in '63' [1963], but he started building the numbers in terms of student majors soon after he came.  And when I left A and T, there were fifty majors in physics, from five my first year, '63' [1963] to 50 in '67' [1967].  So he was a--and let me just tell you how he did that.  He was a very popular, he was a good teacher, and he was popular.  He was young, younger than Dr. Edwards, and there was a little bit of friction there.  But, of course, students, we, as students didn't recognize that.  But he started, he started a colloquium series that we had never had before.  So he would start bringing in people on Friday afternoons.  We had these speakers.  He would bring other black physicists to talk to us, and we'd never seen that.  Or he'd bring physicists in general, and, in fact, on one of those Friday afternoons, in my sophomore year, he brought a woman, the first woman physicist I've ever met.  Her name is Fay Ajzenberg Salove, Fay, F-A-Y, A-J-Z-E-N-B-E-R-G, S-E-L-O-V-E, physicist.  And she becomes also a central person in my life because Fay, who is quite ill now, she's in her late eighties, was the first woman physicist that I ever met.  And that was my sophomore year, and that's because of this colloquium series.  And I'll talk a little bit about her in a few minutes.  But she became, again, a lifetime mentor, whom I've kept in contact with and I really fell in love with her.  And I'll tell you why in a few minutes, but anyhow, let's go back to the sophomore year. The sophomore year we had this series of speakers.  He also, on Fridays in which he did not have speakers, which was sometimes maybe we'd have a speaker once or twice a month, he would--we all would still come together, all the physics students would come together in the department, and he would buy pizza and sodas.  And we would have the college bowel (laughter), every, the physics college bowl--this is the truth.  The physics college bowl.  And so the most senior students, the people who were seniors would have to stand up.  They would be in the front of the room.  And anybody in the audience, the fifty students or so could ask these students questions.  The faculty also came, all the faculty came.  All the physics students, and we had pizza and sodas.  That had never happened before, so, you know, you can get a lot with pizza and sodas.  So that would go on typically on Friday afternoons and it would start around 3:30, 4:00 o'clock.  Nobody was having classes.  And we'd go until 5:00 or 6:00 o'clock.
Speaker 1: Now, college bowl, the name college bowl--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --is derived from a popular, well, I don't know how popular it was, but it was--
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was very popular.
Speaker 1: --but fairly steady television program called the G.E.--
Speaker 2: Exactly, we had--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --College Bowl, that--
Speaker 2: --we had the G.E. prototype, we called, the physics college bowl.  And we had that every Friday.  When we didn't have a colloquium speaker, we would have the college bowl.  And you could ask pretty much any question.  And you know one thing.  Seniors did not want to be embarrassed by some under classmen asking them a question that they couldn't answer.  So there was a lot of preparation, a lot of competition, the whole sense of competition and how to do well.  And so physics was fun.  It was a lot of fun.  We did, I mean we learned so much in those sessions.  Even if you had a bad teacher, that made up for it, and the faculty came.
Speaker 1: Did you ever challenge another school, like the television show--
Speaker 2: No, we never--he didn't do that.
Speaker 1: --that would have Harvard versus Yale.
Speaker 2: No, he didn't, we didn't ever get to that level.  But one of the, one of his sayings was, for example, when we had problems in any of our textbooks, Resin, Holiday whatever.  And he, Gardener would say, he said, you know, at A and T [North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University].  No, he said, at MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology], they may do every other problem, but A and T, we do every problem.  We do every problem.  And so, you know, that stuck with me.  And we did every problem.  We did every problem in every book that we had, plus other problems.  And so that made us very competitive.  And so it, we took physics seriously.  He took it seriously.  Here is a man who had really devoted his whole career to teaching a new generation of scientists.  And that's his mark.  That's his mark on physics.  And it's a really, a good one, a great one.  He was a fabulous teacher and a great mentor to all of us.  And some people who might not have thought they wanted to do physics, just wanted to do physics to be around Alex Gardener 'cause he was that popular.  He was a very popular teacher.  He got, I think at the end of his freshman--end of my freshman year, he was voted the most popular and most outstanding teacher award and something at A and T.  And so, and that gave a little jealously between him and his mentor, Dr. Edwards.  But he still--and then I think after a couple of years, Dr. Edwards was retiring in any case, and he retired.  And so Gardener became the chair, and so then he went--but from five to fifty in four years or three years is a pretty remarkable.  And most of those students in that group, those groups went on to get PhDs.  So that's--
Speaker 1: That's a remarkable (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --a remarkable, he was a, he has made a, on my generation of physicists, a great impression.
Story_ID: 25075
Speaker 1: Now, was he, as you got up in the upper level, to junior and senior year, was Dr. Gardener working on any particular research?
Speaker 2: He would go out to, he had a colleague, and during the summers, he went out to Lawrence Livermore every summer and did research out there.  And he published some papers, but he didn't, he didn't publish a whole lot of papers.  Really, his papers are people, whereas many people, just as many scientists and engineers and physicists, as you know, count the number of publications, he could easily count the number of students.  And that's one of the untold rewards of science.  How many people do you transform?  And he was a transformative teacher and leader.  There's no doubt about it.  There's no doubt--I know you've heard, I'm sure if you've talked to other black physicists, you've heard stories about Gardener, similar stories or, interesting person too, very interesting, both inside and outside the classroom (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Unclear) ever seen stories about his personality.
Speaker 2: Well, he was, people called Gardener a "Maverick".  He was someone who never--his, you know, even though he was an educated man, he never, you know, the edges were never honed, never sharpened.  And so he would say things that were not, that people wouldn't expect him, expect a professor to say.  He'd say it, I mean, you know.  He'd say it in faculty meetings.  He would say it wherever he needed to say it.
Speaker 1: For instance?
Speaker 2: Well, he used choice words very carefully (laughter).  He used a lot of them.  He sometimes said them in class (laughter), I mean, you know, and we would all laugh about it.  But he was, he had, he was a very flowerful, he had a very flowery language that he would use.  And let me just tell you, you did not want to get on his bad side.  And he's had, I never, he never had to use many words 'cause I pretty much, whatever Gardener said, I did, I mean in terms of my work, you know.  But a couple of students had to be taken behind the barn, and he'd get them straight.  He was that kind of guy.  He was, he was rough on the edges, but he was, in terms of his interests for making sure that students were successful was, nobody, nobody ever questioned that.  You couldn't question that.  He was just, he was just tops in terms of a mentor, teacher, giving you the right directions, telling you who to go to graduate school to and where to go and advice.  He was long on that.  So he was, again, an exemplary mentor, I would say.
Story_ID: 25076
Speaker 1: Okay, now, so you graduated in--
Speaker 2: In '67' [1967].
Speaker 1: -- in '67' [1967], right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I went to, my junior year, I spent abroad.  I spent my junior year in college, I went to the University of Munich [Germany], which was another fascinating year for me.  I never, I had never been to the Opera before.  All of, the whole world, a whole new culture--I took courses at the University of Munich.  I took philosophy.  I took physics.  I took topology.  And I did, I did well in those classes.  But it was a year, again, of a whole new culture.  I spent it in Munich.  In fact, many of the Germans, because I could speak German--oh, let me just go back.  When I came home after my, the end of my sophomore year to tell my mother and father that I was going to Germany for my junior year, they said, how do you do that?  What do you--they were flabbergasted.  I mean here, I've hardly been to Washington, D.C. [District of Columbia] and here I am going to Germany for my junior year.  So they were sort of taken aback by that, and my father, I don't think he ever really realized how that actually happened or how--whether he, he said, why are you doing that?  I said, because--and it was a good question because at that time, very few people were doing that.  I mean none of my, no other student at A and T [North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University] was doing that.  But I met this whole group of students, mostly white kids from all over the country who were in this program, some seventy of us, and there were two blacks in the group, who--no, there were two or three science students.  Most of them were liberal arts students from--and this was through a program at the University of Wisconsin and Michigan.  And my German teacher just happened to have given me the application materials and said, Fraulein, you need to apply to this.  And I applied, and I got accepted.
Speaker 1: But it was through the University of Michigan?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was through, it was a joint program at the time through, I think it was Wisconsin and with Michigan, collaborated on an international, on international junior year, "Junior Year Abroad", I think it was called.
Speaker 1: Now, and just to put it into perspective, had your father ever been out of Virginia?
Speaker 2: No, no, to Richmond, maybe.  That's as far, and my mother either, neither one.  I had, I think I had gone to, come to Washington in the seventh grade, a seventh grade field trip.  But that was as far, and, of course, I was in Greensboro.  But I'd never been anywhere either.  So that opened a whole new life.  There's a whole new world.  It was like, again, a whole field of discovery.  So when I came back after my junior year, I had lots of work to do.  And it was not easy because I had not, I had taken some physics, but I hadn't taken the physics that was gonna allow me to graduate on time with my class.  So I took, my freshman--my first semester of my senior year in college, I took seven physics courses (laughter).  Don't tell me how--don't even say how I got through that.  I took seven physics courses, seven.  I had all physics, 'cause I had done all of the other stuff.  I had finished everything else.  And it was just the physics that I had to, if I wanted to finish with my class, I had to do seven classes.
Story_ID: 25077
Speaker 1: Just one more thing about Munich [Germany], though.  Now, well, you were the only two black students you said?
Speaker 2: Only two black students out of about 70.  There were about--40 of us stayed in Munich, and the other 30 or so went to Freiberg [Germany].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so there were two black students.  One young woman, she was again, almost--there was only one other student that was, most of them were liberal arts students.  There was one student who was a math major, a young white woman and whom I kept in contact with for a number of years.  I've seen her, not very much in recent years, but I kept in contact with her at least for 10 or 12 years.  And she also got her PhD in mathematics, and I went on to get my PhD in physics.  But the others I have not, I've had very little contact with since then.
Speaker 1: Okay, so this is 1966.
Speaker 2: This is '66' [1966].  This was also a very interesting time in Munich because Munich, that year, made the decision that they were going to have an underground Metro system.  They had the Strassenbahn before that time.  And so it was an electric motorized car.  And so they brought in all of these--for the first time, Germany began bringing in workers from Turkey.  They called them Gasthof Arbutus (ph.).  And so all of these people were coming into Munich because they were the ones who were building this new Metro underground.  And so Munich was an interesting place that was evolving during that period.  It was a very interesting city.  I heard, and being black American, it's sort of strange to say, I heard Blues in Munich that I had never heard in the United States because that was very popular.  You would go to any of the Hofbrau Houses at the time, and that's what was on, that's what they played, Muddy Waters and people like that.  They were playing all this American Blues.  That was very popular in Germany.  And it was not popular here.
Speaker 1: Did you see any live performances by any African Americans in--
Speaker 2: No, I, you know, I went, I saw lots of live performances.  I went to the Opera whenever I could because the Opera was cheap.  I could stand in line with my student pass, and I could go to the Opera for the equivalent of $1.00.  It was DM 4.00 Deutschemark at the time.  And I could get great seats.  So I spent most of the time that I went to the Munich Opera.  It was a fabulous Opera.  And I saw all of, at that time in my life, I was very much interested in Vogner [Wagner], so I saw many of the Wagnerarian operas.  I saw Mozart.  I saw, it was a great place to be.  I had a great student life, and the interesting thing about that is, I decided, since I was in Germany, I wanted to be, do what the Germans did.  I had a German roommate who was very, very Germanish herself.  She was from Kiel and she spoke pure German, I mean, you know, they make this distinction.  And so she, in some ways, said, well, why don't we go to the Opera.  I went with her some, but not a whole lot.  But I, and in doing that, I did not accept for when we had to come to the central site where we all met once a week, all the American students.  I didn't see very many American students.  I really pretty much immersed myself in the German culture.  And most people thought I was German 'cause I could speak German.  I was at the University, called me the Swatz, they called me the war baby, the Krueger Kent (laughter).  That was me (laughter).  Many of the people, the locals called me the Krueger Kent 'cause they thought I was a war baby.
Speaker 1: Were there very many war babies that you met?  I mean African Americans?
Speaker 2: Well, not many, no.  No, no, but there were, you know, there were some remnants, of course, of the Army being in Germany and all.  But they, most of the locals in Munich thought I was a Krueger Kent, is what they called me.
Speaker 1: Did you come in contact with any of the American Army forces (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: No, I didn't, not, rarely.  No, I did not really come in contact with them even though there was a facility there.  I didn't, no.  I think you had to go look for that, and I wasn't out there looking (laughter).  You had to--'cause we lived in the, we had a, there was a student house that we lived in.  I, it was sort of out from the main downtown Munich where I lived.  And it was mixed.  It was coed, but it was a whole, you know, the unit--German universities don't have dormitories.  So they had student houses around and about the city.  So I lived there, and that was a good year.  That was a great year.
Story_ID: 25078
Speaker 1: All right, so back to the senior year.  This is, seven physic courses--
Speaker 2: Senior, seven physics classes.  That's what I had to do if I wanted to graduate.  And I wanted to graduate with my class.  I didn't want to, you know, they said, well, you can stay.  I said, no, I can't do--also, I couldn't, I wouldn't have been able to keep my scholarship had I decided to do that.  So I stuck it out and I hunkered down, and I got through it, with the help of one of my--he went on to get his PhD, Johnnie Richardson, who was one of my classmates, who was very smart, very, very smart.  And we worked together.  We did all of our, for example, our senior lab.  He did the experiments, and I did the theory.  So I wrote up all the reports, and he did the experiments.  And so, and we studied together.  Johnny and I were, we were study partners.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, did you graduate with special honors?
Speaker 2: Yes, I graduated with honors.  I was, well, I had, I graduated cum laude, cum laude, which was about a 3.3, 3.4 GPA, whatever.  But I was a good, all-around student.  I didn't get, I don't think I got any awards.  I was not, undergraduate, I was a very, I just did, I did physics, and I, people knew I read a lot.  I think I was known in some ways of being, you know, smart.  But in terms of making a whole lot of college friends, I didn't.  I had, I think I had more friends, faculty friends than college friends.  And that goes back really to the first day when I--I was also the first in my family to go to college.  And I had these very exalted ideas about what college would be.  And so as, the summer before going to college, I spent the whole summer--at that time, you would get suggested reading lists to go to college.  It was something like forty books on this reading list.  And so I spent the summer reading all these books, and I'm just knowing, I'm checking into the dormitory that everybody else has read these books.  Nobody had read those books.  You know, I'm talking about, Cold War stories, 'War and Peace' and 'Crime and Punishment' by [Fyodor] Dostoyevsky, and they say, looking at me like, where did you come from?  Nobody had read the book, and I was very, I was very disappointed that students had not read, you know.  And so, so I didn't--my freshman year in college, I made friends with--the faculty loved me because I was a, I was very coachable.  I was like a, in terms of learning, I think in that period of my life, I was just like a sponge.  You tell me to, tell me what it is, and I go get it.  I was a go-getter in terms of learning.  And I had this whole, I had all of these people now, instead of now having--I had Dr. Gardener I could go to for physics.  I had Dr. Johnson I could go to for philosophy. And I had my German teacher who I could go to for German.  And I had all these people who could advise me.  It was just like, I was just like--I had been, college for me was my great time to really explore.  I had all these smart people who could give me all kinds of advice.  And I used that, I think I made use of that more than most students did.  And not that I was in trouble academically.  I went to them because I wanted to learn more.  And so I had this whole, and I had all these people who were interested.  I had now a whole march group of faculty who seemed to have been interested in what it is I wanted to do.  And that was a, that was, for me, a gift.
Story_ID: 25079
Speaker 1: So when you were on the verge of graduating, did you, had you chosen a graduate school, and had you (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: I had not chosen a graduate school, and let me tell you what happened.  I, Dr. Gardener, in his advice, he said, why don't you get in touch with Fay Salove.  That's the story I want to tell here.  And she had come, and I said, I had written to her once maybe or twice.  And, you know, there're lots of opportunities for students graduating in physics, with a Bachelors degree, woman, first one to get a Bachelors degree from A and T [North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University] in physics, first woman.  And so there were lots of things that I had, that I was considering.  And one was graduate school.  Then Dr. Gardener--there's this thing that came in from the, he gave this to me.  The Ford Foundation had what was called a "post-bachelorette fellowship" for students who wanted to go on to graduate school.  And he gave that to me.  And he said, you know, Arlene, I think you should do this because, you know, you really didn't, you really had a--you had to cram and work like crazy for your senior year.  And maybe you need to have a year where you really sit back and think about preparing for graduate school, really in the right way.  And this Ford Foundation post-bachelorette fellowship is what I finally chose.  I also had a, I applied for the Peace Corp.  I applied to--I don't think, I'm trying to think, did I apply to graduate school at that point?  I might have applied to graduate school  But his, upon his advice, he said to take the post-bachelorette fellowship, which I did.  And I went, that gave me a year at Bryn Mawr [College] in Haverford [Pennsylvania], and I was, again, my friend, Fay, who became my friend because she invited me.  When she learned that I was coming to Bryn Mawr, she invited me to her house often for supper.  And, and I expressed to her my disappointment at the courses that I was taking at Bryn Mawr.  I said, I've had all of this stuff.  I'm bored.  And she said, why are you continuing to--she taught at Haverford.  So, with, upon her advice, I did only one semester at Bryn Mawr, and I took all of my courses the second year, which I was able to do because Bryn Mawr and Haverford [College] had a relationship.  And I took all of my second semester courses at Haverford which was a great experience because two things happened.  Bryn Mawr didn't seem to know that there had been any physics that had occurred past 1900.  And I said, I've had all of this stuff on top.  I've had quantum mechanics.  I've, we had had a great, we'd had a great physics program at A and T.  And I said, I feel like I'm going backwards.  And so I took, I went to Haverford the second--I took statistical mechanics, which is the same statistical mechanics I found in graduate school, same book.  I'd worked all the problems.  So I had an advance there.  And I took elementary particle physics, which I had never had before.  So Haverford, even though it was an undergraduate school, had all these new courses, and I really liked it.  And as a result of that, and Fay's support, I applied to the University of Virginia for graduate school.  I think I applied at the end of that post-bachelorette year.  And I went to UVA [University of Virginia] as a graduate student.  She knew people there, and I got a great letter from her, and I got a scholarship.  And that was the, that was, I got a full scholarship to UVA.  And I thought that was a, that was--it was interesting to me to do that because when I had been applying to colleges for undergraduate school, and, of course, the University of Virginia was not open to blacks or to women, and not even undergraduates 'cause they didn't start their graduate--undergraduates could not come to UVA unless you were a male until 1971. So that's interesting. University of Virginia, a state university was all male up until (laughter) 1971.
Speaker 1: And it was the one founded by Thomas Jefferson--
Speaker 2: Yes, exactly.
Speaker 1: --in Charlottesville.
Speaker 2: Exactly, in Charlottesville.  But it was all male (laughter).  So, so it's a--that's again, that's all steeped in the Virginia history and tradition.  But the point is, so I couldn't have gone there as an undergraduate.
Story_ID: 25080
Speaker 1: I wanted to go back a minute--
Speaker 2: Go back.
Speaker 1: I know Dr. King was killed in '68' [1968].
Speaker 2: Sixty-eight [1968].
Speaker 1: You were at Bryn Mawr [College] or Haverford [College] then?
Speaker 2: I was finishing up my year.  That was April of '68' [1968], yeah.
Speaker 1: What was the reaction among you and your friends?
Speaker 2: Not much, no.  I mean it wasn't, that was not--these are, you know, the kids who go to Haverford and Bryn Mawr were very wealthy for the most part.  They were in--very few black people there, not on the faculty.  I did have a discussion with Fay about this.  In fact, I think she invited me and several other students who were at Haverford to her house.  But in terms of just the, you know, the astonishment and the feeling of the great loss.  I mean nobody else was feeling that.  It just wasn't there.  Like I remember, and, you know, the day that I heard, I was walking--this was my freshman year.  The day I heard that John F. Kennedy [President John F. Kennedy] had been killed, I was almost, I almost fell to the ground in astonishment.  And that was not the reaction there.  There was not much, it didn't cause much angst at all.  But, of course, they come from a whole different background.  And their experiences have been very, very different from anything that I had ever experienced.  My experiences were completely different from theirs.  So, of course, I had a reaction.  But they did not, necessarily.  It was not the kind, it was not, I mean I guess they knew who Martin Luther King [Jr.] was, but it wasn't, it didn't impact their lives.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's unfortunate.  It's like two different Americas.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Story_ID: 25081
Speaker 1: So, University of Virginia, so you start in 1969?
Speaker 2: Sixty-eight [1968].
Speaker 1: Sixty-eight [1968]?
Speaker 2: Sixty-eight [1968], September of '68' [1968].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I got to University of Virginia, September '68' [1968], and I was in the physics department, and this is a story that I tell you, I've not told this to very many people.  But in any case, the first day of class, there are--and this is in our classical mechanics class.  Professor comes in.  There are thirty eight white boys and me.  That's who's in the class, thirty eight.  So there're thirty nine people in the class.  And that's important.  So the professor comes in, classical mechanics.  And he teaches the class, and then at the end of the class, he says, I'm going to give you your first homework assignment.  And I would encourage you all to work in groups of three.  That's what he said, I'm gonna encourage you to work in groups of three.  And there were fourteen groups.  There were fourteen groups.  I was a group of one.  So nobody would work with me the first semester.  So--
Speaker 1: Do you think he did the math before he came up with that (laughter)?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I don't think he did the math.  I don't think he did the math, but in any case, so let me just tell you this.  The interesting thing about this is, so I must admit, I struggled some in my first, freshman, my first semester because, but the good news here, the good news out of this, what might have been discouraging to many was that on tests, I had worked ten problems, and the guys had only worked two or three.  So typically, for the test, I would be number three, number four on the test.  And the long and short of the story is that at the end of the first semester, the two top males in that class invited me to their group.
Story_ID: 25082
Speaker 1: So at the end of the first semester of graduate school, I was invited by the top two students to join their group.  And as I was saying, at UVA (University of Virginia), for the most part, I was the first in the library every morning at about 7:00 o'clock, and I was the last to leave every night.  So, it was an interesting experience.  I, at the end of my first year, I got invited, I really did get invited to work with Judah Eisenberg's group.  That was the theoretical nuclear physics group and people, you know, what happened at UVA was that you would go around, and you would talk to various groups that you thought you might want to join during your fresh--first year.  And so I had talked--that really was the only group I wanted to work with because they were the top theorists, theoretical physicists on campus.  Eisenberg was well known as a top scientist.  He was highly regarded, even though he was a very young scientist himself.  He was probably only four or five years older than most of his graduate students.  But that was a group I wanted to be involved in, and so I got invited at the end of my freshman year to join them, which I did.
Speaker 2: Okay, so--
Speaker 1: But, that's not the end of the story.  It turns out that Eisenberg was, made the decision probably four or five months after I joined his group that I would be his last student, and that he was going back to, he was going to Israel.  So I, he took me on as his last student.  So I got my Masters degree at UVA.  But I was his last student, and he left the United States, he and his family.  And he went back to Israel--he went to Israel.  He had not been in Israel.  He was at a university there in Israel.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And that's how I, so in the interim, when I was finishing up my Masters degree at UVA, I had applied to four or five schools.  And I always had used Dr. Gardener to be one of my referees, to write letters of reference.  And I got, I got all these, after about three months, I got all these notices that my application was incomplete.  And I'm saying why is my application, and so I called Dr. Gardener.  And I said, well, why haven't you written the letters for me?  Why didn't you write the letter?  He said, I didn't write the letter because I want you to come here (laughter).  So he refused to write any letters for me.  I got a letter from Eisenberg.  But he, so I ended up coming to Howard [University], again, because that was, Dr. Gardener had made the decision of where I was coming and not me.  But I had applied to, I had applied to--where had I applied?  I applied to the University of Chicago, I'd applied to Berkley [University of California, Berkeley].  I'd applied to about three or four schools when I got these letters back saying my application was incomplete.  And then I said, well, what's going on?  And so, and I had done fairly well, I think on the graduate record exam.  So I was competitive.  It wasn't that I was not competitive.  And I didn't get--he had made the decision he wanted me to come to Howard.
Speaker 2: Okay, (laughter).  So how did you, well, this is your, you know, undergraduate mentor--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --and great teachers, so--
Speaker 1: But he wasn't doing research at the time.  So he said, he said, I will be your advisor and mentor, but I can't, I cannot be your thesis advisor.  So he had one of his colleagues, Tung Sang, whom I worked with to get my PhD at Howard.  But that, I had not planned to come to Howard for my graduate work.  That was not my intention.  I had not even applied to Howard, but I'm glad I did in retrospect.  I had not applied to Howard, and he--but he was, it was his intention that I should come to Howard 'cause he had moved, subsequently, I think he had come to Howard in 1968 or something '69' [1969].
Story_ID: 25083
Speaker 1: Okay, so Howard University and you're there in what seventy--
Speaker 2: I was there in 1971 to '74' [1974].
Speaker 1: Seventy-four [1974].
Speaker 2: So, pretty much I came to Howard, and I sat for the qualifiers right away.  So I didn't, I took, I didn't take, I took very little coursework at Howard.  I took, you know, graduate, research, but I pretty much came to do my degree, and I worked, I also worked in his program.  He had a, Dr. Gardener had established this program at Howard called, what was it called, "Comprehensive Sciences".  It was science for non-science majors.  This was in the '70s [1970s] when people are creating all these new things.  And so he had created this whole division.  And we had all these non-science majors.  So I worked with him in that program, teaching non-science majors.  I taught the physical sciences, and I did my graduate--my, really, my research, my theoretical.  I was a theoretical person.  And so I was able to do that.  But the interesting thing about that program is that we were converting, we had 3,000 students going through that program a year.  And we were converting about 10 to 15 percent of those students to science and math majors.  Again, he was doing this transformative stuff.  He had (laughter), it was a, we had--this was his invention again.  He invented, he had--you got A, B or C in these classes or no grade.  You couldn't fail.  So you'd have to take them over, and he had these sessions, and we'd go to the laboratory.  And he had this man who was a, he was a Yale [Yale University], he was jazz disk jockey.  And he had jazz background, music, to all these questions in science and mathematics (laughter).  Again, nobody else has done it like that.  But that was his idea, and it worked because they had this nice music behind all these questions and concepts.  And we had a laboratory that students, you could send them to the laboratory and--
Speaker 1: Who was the musician?  Do you remember?
Speaker 2: No, they were all kinds of, all kinds of Jazz musicians.  The person, the disk jockey was Yale Lewis.
Speaker 1: Oh, a disk jockey, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was a local, he was a local TV, I mean radio star.  And so he hired him to do all this disc jockeying for these science sessions.  He was, he liked jazz, and so nobody had ever, I don't anybody has done that before or since.  But it was very effective because students love to go to the lab, these non-science majors.  And about 10 to 15 percent of 'em, as I said, we had about, each year--and I worked in that program three years.  Every year we had about 3,000 students.  And we had at the end of that year, students who said they had no interests in science or changing their majors to sciences, computer science, Sumter physics, zoology, biology, astronomy.  And that was Alex Gardener's doing again.  He had transformed himself again.  And so we had these large numbers of students, and we actually made several presentations and papers about that work at Howard, what was going on.  We kept data, and so that, but that was--it was, again, an interesting kind of time.
Story_ID: 25084
Speaker 1: Okay, now, what was your dissertation about?
Speaker 2: My dissertation was on liquid metals.  I did work in, it was really the velocity order of correlation functions of liquid metals.  Liquid metals, gallium and lithium, these are--the final application of the interests in liquid metals in the late '60's [1960s] and '70's [1970] was that the, we actually had these liquid metal video things.  That was the final application.  Even though my research was not on that particular application.  It was doing all of the theoretical investigations of those systems, which eventually led to these special screens, liquid screens.  This work was also, a lot of work of this work was done at the Bell Laboratories.
Speaker 1: When you mean liquid screens, you're talking about like plasma screens-
Speaker 2: Plasma, yes, yes.
Speaker 1: --what we call--
Speaker 2: Yes, the application of that, you know, when you're used to--you touch a screen, and you'd get an imprint sort of, and it would--
Speaker 1: Spread?
Speaker 2: Exactly.  That's the result of much of the theoretical work, and, in fact, the experimental work.  A lot of experiments were going on at that time at Bell Laboratories.  And I actually got to meet, and we became very good friends, the person who actually got the first patent, Pat Gladys, on liquid metal screens.  She got patents on that area.  And I met her at various meetings as a graduate student and then afterwards, when I finished my PhD.  And we got to be very good friends, in fact.  But she was a leader in that field.
Story_ID: 25085
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so the PhD dissertation, so you finished your work in '74' [1974]?
Speaker 2: Seventy-four [1974], yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, and, now, you went--
Speaker 2: I left, when I left Howard [University] in the Spring of--I stayed on after finishing my PhD for one semester.  And I was looking for jobs.  I finished in December, so I was looking for jobs, and I got, I applied to, oh, I must have applied to twenty, thirty places.  And I got about four or five offers.  I got an offer from Rutgers [University].  I got an offer from MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology] Lincoln Labs.  This was an easy job market at the time.  But, and I--but I got four or five offers.  And I got the offer, and I went to, I took the offer for MIT Lincoln Labs.  And that was, and I continued to do theoretical work.  Again, it somewhat changed.  I did work on, I did some work then on, beginning work on semiconductors, gallium arsenide.  And I also, during that same period, is when I met Alex Animalu, who was at Lincoln Lab as a senior scientist.  And he was doing work on--
Speaker 1: Could you, I'm sorry.  Can you spell his name?  Alex--
Speaker 2: Yeah, Alexander, A-L-E-X-A-N-D-E-R, Animalu, A-N-I-M-A-L-U.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And Alex, I met him in the library.  Again, the, you know, let me just describe the general situation.  At Lincoln Labs at that time, there were probably about fifteen or 1,600 scientists, very few black people, maybe ten total out of that number.  And my interaction, in fact, with any minority scientists or engineers was when I went over to MIT.  And I did that maybe several times a month for lunch.  And I'd meet them over in the faculty dining hall.  But I, there were very few blacks at Lincoln Lab.  In fact, Alex was one of the few, and, in fact, I told him what I was doing, and he told me what he was doing.  He was doing pseudo potential theory.  And I said, that is very interesting.  I'm very interested in that.  And so, I published several papers with Alex.  And I made the decision after my, after a year, I made the decision to leave Lincoln Labs.  I felt terribly isolated, and Alex--part of my decision--if Alex had stayed at Lincoln, I probably would have stayed longer.  But he went, he made the decision to go back to Nigeria.  He said I, you know, he had come here, had been here probably about eight or ten years, been to Missouri.  He'd been at, and was at Lincoln.  And he was, he had come here because of the Biafra War.  He left, and--
Speaker 1: Was he an Igbo?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, Igbo.  And so he decided to go back, and so--and I found that collaboration with Alex very fruitful.  We were, you know, we're sort of synergistic.  We had the same interests, similar interests.  He was doing theory.  I was doing it, and we were doing it together.  It was one of the first times I really had a person who was not my advisor that I could work with, collaborate with.  And that was very interesting to me, and he was very, he was very prolific.  I mean he had--and, in fact, during that year, he had also, I actually, even though I don't get recognition for it, I actually edited his book on pseudo potential theory with Prentiss Hall.  He asked me to read all the chapters which I did, and I edited.  I did a lot of editing of the book that he had been writing and that he got published at the end of that year.  But had he stayed, I would have stayed, I think.  But in any case, we, and sort of we--he went back to Africa.  He got involved.  He was at the University of Nsukka.
Story_ID: 25086
Speaker 1: And I left, and I came to Morgan [State University].  And that was, again, so I bounced around some.  But, and I came to Morgan, and I stayed at Morgan two years.  That was, it was interesting, but it was not what I wanted.  I did some research, but I didn't do a whole lot of research at Morgan.  I was, looked like I was sort of getting away from the research track.  And I was appointed the associate dean there, at Morgan, very young to be an associate dean of anything.
Speaker 2: This is in nineteen seventy--
Speaker 1: Seventy-seven [1977].
Speaker 2: Nineteen seventy-seven [1977].
Speaker 1: Something like that, yeah.  But that's what I did, and I actually, I did make an impact there because I actually wrote or did much of the work for the Master plan for the establishment of the engineering program at Morgan [Morgan State University] and what turned out to be the program at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County.  I was the one who, I was sort of the architect of what programs to go where.  And that was done.  The engineering program at Morgan was established in 1978 as a result of that work.  This was something the state had mandated.  And so I wrote the, I wrote that strategic plan and Master plan, pretty much, I did most of the work.  I had lots of interaction during that year with the people at the State Council, the Maryland Higher Education Council, it's called.  And, as a result of that, I was nominated for the AC, no, no, was it?  Yeah, I was nominated for the AC fellowship from Morgan.
Speaker 2: What year is this?
Speaker 1: Huh?
Speaker 2: What year is this?
Speaker 1: This is '78' [1978].
Speaker 2: Seventy-eight [1978], okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah, the president nominated me for the AC fellowship.  And so the American Council of Education.  So '78' [1978], '79' [1979], I guess, yeah, yeah.  I spent the year in the--this was a year that you could design yourself.  And so I spent the year working in the post-secondary education, the Department of Education.  Mary Barry was the assistant secretary.  So I got to meet her and work with her staff, and I spent the second part of the year down at the Maryland Higher Education Council, which was interesting.  But I'm now getting off track in terms of my science and my physics and my teaching 'cause I'm not teaching very much.  I'm not publishing a whole lot of papers, but I'm doing all these, I guess, you might call, interesting things.  And at the end of that year, I, as do most people, I got involved, I guess I got Potomac fever like most people do when they come to Washington.  And so when I left the, that fellowship, I actually got a job at the National Science Foundation.
Story_ID: 25087
Speaker 1: Okay, now, what was your job title there?
Speaker 2: I was a program director.  I was hired by Shirley McBey.  You've probably heard that name.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Have you interviewed her?
Speaker 1: I haven't done it personally, no.
Speaker 2: But you know about her, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yes, (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: She hired me (laughter).
Speaker 1: So this is 19--
Speaker 2: Eighty, this is 1980.
Speaker 1: Eighty [1980], okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, 1980.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: So I come to the Foundation, and, again, it's interesting.  I'm running, I'm working with her on this minority science education program.  And we have grants.  We have $5 million, and we're distributing grants to all these black colleges and Hispanic colleges and tribal colleges.  And that was interesting because I was the, again, another first, sort of.  No one--we had a number of grants.  The National Science Foundation had a number of grants at tribal colleges, but nobody from NSF had ever visited one.  So I'm the (laughter), so within two months, three months of my being there, I get nominated.  They said, well, you should go.  I mean, so I went out to Nebraska, South Dakota and North Dakota and visited about--it took a week, and visited the four tribal colleges.  That had never been, that had never happened before.  The American Indiana Community College, the Oglala Sioux Community College and there were three or four others.  But in the week, it took me a week to do that, driving--I was driving and flying on these dirt strip planes and stuff to get to these places.  But that was also a, it was a revelation because I had frankly, being an American, I had never been on an American Indian Reservation before.  And so I got to see the way people live in Pine Ridge, which was very, I mean very--I was somewhat, I'm sure I wrote a very long report, but it was somewhat distressing to me to see the conditions that many American Indian people live in.  And even though I had met American Indian scientists, I had no idea that the life on the reservations was, the conditions that I found there.  Students, I mean it was just, it was really, it's deplorable.  It's a very, very terrible, it's a--again, it's one of the stories, nasty stories of America.  It's, it's like in some ways, it's worse than segregation.  And so, but they were doing science as they could.  Much of it was environmental science, the projects.  And students came once a week because that was the best travel.  Students had to travel a hundred fifty miles, 200 miles to class, driving distances were long and hard.  So people were achieving at these schools, despite the almost horrific conditions under which they had to work.  And so you had a lot of dedicated people.  The faculty there at these schools was just unbelievable, some of the things that they did, and very few native people, unfortunately, because they didn't have--the native people who were doing science didn't stay on the reservation.  They went someplace else.  So almost none of these people, most of them were missionary-type folks, who were doing extraordinary things in unbelievably bad conditions.  So I made that report to the National Science Foundation.  And I'm sure, there was not very many funded projects at that time to the American Indian colleges.  But that, those dollars increased after my visit because how, I mean they didn't--when I, I had pictures and I described the situations as I found them were not, it was not pretty, as we say.  It was a not a pretty situation, but people were still, and they were, their reports--you could glean something from the reports, but the reports don't tell the whole story, as you know.  And so I would say that was my biggest impact at the Foundation those two years.
Speaker 1: So you were there till '81' [1981], is that--
Speaker 2: Yes, in '81' [1981], again, history, the President Reagan was the president, and he made the decision that all science education programs will be abolished.  You may remember that.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: You remember that?
Speaker 1: Yes, he did many things (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: And all of them will be abolished.  So the, in the effort to protect the Minority Science program, all of the science education directorate at NSF was abolished.  But the program that I was with, they put it in a protected mode, as they call it.  And so that program was actually transferred to the Department of Education.  And so, here is a program that science, there's no science around it.  How do you expect to thrive in a situation in which nobody around you has any clue about doing anything related to science.  So I stayed with the program for six months, and then I went to the CIA [Central Intelligence Agency].
Story_ID: 25088
Speaker 1: Okay, now, the CIA, now, this is an intimidating three letters.  So, how did that happen, the CIA?
Speaker 2: How did that happen?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: I guess it was an accident.  I applied for, I actually applied for the job 'cause I wanted to leave--I liked Washington, but I wanted to leave.  I didn't want to, I didn't, I mean I had done that.  I didn't like the environment over at the Department of Education.  I'm sure I could have stayed.  I know I could have stayed.  In fact, people wanted me to stay.  But I said, I'm--and the program still survives today.  But it's a completely different kind of program.  And it's, and it hasn't grown, and this, the science programs at the NSF [National Science Foundation] are much more progressive in terms of meeting national needs.  That program is pretty much the way it was in the '70s [1970s].  It hasn't grown because it's not, doesn't have the environment.  It's just like putting a scientist in an environment where there's no science going on, and except that scientist to flourish.  So it's the same thing with programs.  So the program has not flourished.  It's giving out money each year, but in terms of--and I have actually gotten a grant since that time.  I've written a grant (laughter) and got one.  But it hasn't grown and made the impact that I think should have happened.  And it's still at the same and about the same amount of money in terms of inflation.  So, but I went to the CIA.  And that was a very interesting--
Speaker 1: Now, did they have, did you respond to an ad or--
Speaker 2: No, I didn't respond to an ad.  I don't know how I actually--I might have, you know, it's, I remember getting this call.  I must have applied for a job.  But, you know, the CIA gets thousands of jobs.  They don't get very many physicists.  I must have met someone at a meeting, and was talking about my physics background and that's probably--more than likely, that's what happened because I usually, I go to--still do, go to lots of meetings.  And so I'm sure that was what it was.  And so I, any case, I go into this job in which I really, they don't really tell me, can't me a lot of what I'm--they said, well, you'll be looking at, doing physics and doing some physics, interacting with physicists and scientists which was fascinating to me and interesting.  And it turned out that pretty much, I was pretty much, I was the--as a young scientist, I became a big decision maker in shaping the field in semiconductor physics.
Speaker 1: Okay, just kind of explain to us like what you were, what your project (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Well, I can now talk about it.  But for years, I couldn't, but it's now thrity years, so I can talk about it.  But I was the, at that time, we had, there was a push by the Department of Defense and the military for devices that had, could hold more memory, could actually store, memory storage devices.  And we had, in the '80s [1980s] very little was going on.  The Department of Defense was pushing that field.  The CIA was pushing it, but in terms of actual devices, there weren't any.  There were no large-scale devices like, that, more than ten transistors, meaning large scale, and in three years, we went from ten devices on a silicon chip to a hundred thousand [100,000] devices.
Speaker 1: So, now, I suppose this is called--
Speaker 2: This is called--
Speaker 1: --through nano technology?
Speaker 2: This is, this is not nano technology yet.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: This is micro.
Speaker 1: Micro?
Speaker 2: But we didn't have, but we had, we didn't have any storage devices with more than ten transistors.  The transistor had been invented in 1971, and it was still pretty much until the early '70s [1971], early '80s [1980s], a single device.  We hadn't thought of how to integrate this device to make smaller devices.  That, it was still, it was not--there were no consumer devices that multi-transistors on them.  So that seems astonishing in today's, when you just pick up stuff, and you got all these, this integration that's going on.  But at that time, that was not the case.  So you didn't have any high-storage, random access memory, which has been a--that's been the big boom for what has happened in computers.  That wasn't going on.  You had a, for example, in the, and even in '80s [1980s], my first Apple [Computer] had 64 kilobytes of memory, which was very expensive.  Now, 64 kilobytes, nobody, people talk about, how many gigs [gigabytes] can you get?  Fifty gigs, a hundred gigs.  That was not possible in terms of memory.  So the whole idea of integrating all of these devices now on a single chip was revolutionary.  And that's what, that is what began to give us high-storage, personal computer devices.  So I was involved in that early work with Hughes National Laboratory, with Rockwell, and I also had several projects with Bell Laboratories during that period.  And I had, I had, as, my--I had oversight of $30 million.  So I had lots of money.  So I was in the, in that world.  All this work was, of course, at that time, was classified, highly classified.  I worked in a double-vaulted office, and I had, I didn't even know how many clearances I had.  But when I checked out in late '83' [1983], I had 39 clearances.  So, but I moved that field in lots of ways.  In fact, I became the intelligence spokesperson for the very high integrated circuit systems, that I was the person who went around to all the other agencies.  I worked with people at Westinghouse, Rockwell, all the, all the big companies.  You name them, I was working with their, interacting with their vice presidents for research.  That was my typical starting point in these big companies.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, and these devices were storage devices for--
Speaker 2: For memory.
Speaker 1: --intelligence?
Speaker 2: Yeah, no, for, yeah, because one of the problems, of course, is there's lots of data being collected all the time.  And there's no way to store it, and then there's no way to analyze it once you, once you--you know, you have all these satellites, for example, that are collecting data all the time.  How do you store the data?  So storage was a big, big problem that we now have, we know how to do that.  We know how to store it.  We still don't, we're not as good.  We're a lot better than we used to be on analyzing these data because we have now high-performance computing.
Story_ID: 25089
Speaker 1: So that's what, so that has been a--and so I got, I became, I got back immersed, I actually, even though I was, had these projects, I had to know all of the physics behind it.  I published papers during that time, but I did not, I didn't publish a whole lot of stuff in the open literature.  I had technical reports, and they're still not in the open literature.  But I did, I was very, I was a known figure.  People at all of the places knew me.  I went to lots of professional meetings, not only in the United States, but also in Japan.  I got a chance to go to Japan.  I think that's--most of the meetings at that time were, the meetings in semiconductor physics or the I-Triple E meetings were either in the United States or in Japan, at the most part.  I got to meet people at Fujitsu National Laboratory.  I mean I actually visited there.  That's an interesting story.
Speaker 2: Now, Fuji is the largest electronics maker--
Speaker 1: Exactly.
Speaker 2: --in Japan.
Speaker 1: Exactly.
Speaker 2: A lot of people here don't know it, right?
Speaker 1: Yes, exactly.  Buy I visited Fujitsu in 19--it must have been '82' [1982].  And that's an interesting story there because, of course, I had to go undercover.  So we get to Fujitsu, and I'm with people--there are nine of us, eight men and me again.  I always, all these all-male groups, and there're people (unclear) scientists, there're people, several other people from the CIA.  There're people from the Military.  And so we get there, and so I said, well, I'd like to use the facilities.  Well, it turned out that they had never had a woman visitor.  So they didn't have any facilities (laughter).  So anyhow, they go in, and they find a place, and they shoo out all the people and then they get me a facility that I can use.  So they'd never had a woman.  So we go into this meeting, and they're--the meeting, many of the Japanese scientists knew some English.  Of course, we knew little or no Japanese.  And, but we did have a translator at the meeting.  So any case the top scientist's English was pretty good, his English was pretty good.  And so this meeting goes on for, oh, thirty,forty minutes, technical discussions.  We're all involved in the discussion.  And so at the end of the session, I asked the main presenter, I said, well, what are the specifications for this new super computer because there was a [war?].  He didn't know who I was, and I think he was fascinated with me, had never seen anybody who looked like me before.  And so, he gave me--everybody's still, they couldn't believe it.  He gave me all the specs, all the technical specifications.  And then I said, I said, would you happen to have a picture of this new super computer?  And he said, oh, yes, yes we do.  So he goes back into the cabinet, and he brings out this three by four, sort of picture.  And he gives it to me, full color.  And, of course, you can't look surprised in the meeting.  I thanked him, and we come out of the meeting.  And they said, boy, did you hit the, you hit the jackpot 'cause I had all of this stuff.  And I finally, when I came back to the United States, and I gave my report and the Far East, there had been--it turns out that there had been a man in the CIA who had been trying to get information.  He'd been under his desk for four years trying to get all this information on the super computer.  And the, and here I come back with all the technical specs and the picture.  I got commendation from the Far Eastern Division for that work.  But they hadn't asked, you haven't asked the right questions.  So it was, that was a, an example of how diversity counts.  Had I not been in that group, I suspect we would not have got any of this information that the United States government had been trying to get for four years.  And in one visit, one session, I came back with the jackpot.  So, I think--and part of it was that they had not, and they--of course, I had a, they didn't know what my position was or anything.  They didn't know that I was a scientist or that I was at the CIA or any of that 'cause I had a cover.  But the point is, I think--
Speaker 2: Can you tell us what you, what they thought you were, who they thought you were?
Speaker 1: My cover was, I was a policy person with the Department of Defense.  That was my cover.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: It didn't say anything about CIA or even that I a scientist.  They knew I was with this delegation.  So.
Speaker 2: Do you think that they just didn't suspect that you were, you had the scientific background to understand?
Speaker 1: I'm sure they didn't, yeah.  They had never had a woman visitor.  They didn't expect that I had the technical background, but I did--I asked the question, the two--the most important questions of that meeting, after a 40-minute discussion.  I was the one who asked the question, "Do you have the technical specs, and do you have a picture?"  Who else would have thought of that (laughter)?  Not in that group 'cause these were all males, program managers and all of them, all of us were scientists.  But they would, see, I think the best intelligence analysts are the ones, you do the analysis without ever, without anybody ever knowing it.  So I was a very good analyst in that regard.  In fact, my--typically, when I came back from meetings and had briefings, my briefings were always longer than most of my colleagues.  If I were sent to a meeting, typically, I would come back after a meeting.  I would have two or 300 cards with descriptions of what that person actually did or how--and that was, and so I was un--nobody suspected that I had the kind of technical background that could actually make a report.  I was being underestimated.  And that's a good position to be in, in intelligence.  That's what I tell some of my students now.  That's a very good position.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so you worked for the CIA for how long?
Speaker 1: Three years, almost three years.
Speaker 2: Three years, okay, '81' [1981] to '84' [1984]?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Story_ID: 25090
Speaker 1: I think the other interesting thing during this period when I was at the CIA, I also, as I said, I had access to a large amount of money.  And one of the interesting visits, I think one of the most interesting visits that I made with the highest payoff was when I visited Bell Laboratories, probably also in the 1982.  And I got to meet with Horace Stormer at Bell Labs, and--
Speaker 2: Who is this, I'm sorry?
Speaker 1: Horst Stormer is his name, S-T--
Speaker 2: Horst Stormer.
Speaker 1: H-O-R-S-T, Stormer, S-T-O-R-, Umlaut (ph.)-M-E-R, German name.  But he had been doing work in quantum physics, the quantum hall effect.  And when I visited him, I was very interested in that because that, the--that research had very strong possibilities for fast, high-speed devices, high-speed transistors, high-speed, well, high-speed devices.  And so I went, I visited him, and we--when I visited him, and I started talking about a paper that he had published about a year earlier.  He said, oh, I'm not doing any of that research anymore.  I said, why aren't you doing that research?  And he said, well, I'm not doing that research because Bell Labs has, is not funding it, and so I've redirected my research.  So I encouraged him, with a small contract of about a hundred thousand dollars, to take that research, the quantum, the work that he had been doing on the quantum hall effect, to take that research off the shelf, and, in fact, that work that he took off the shelf ended up as the Nobel Prize in 1998 in Physics for the quantum hall effect.  But he had, he had stopped working on it.  He had published one paper in that area, and that has larger implications right now for what's going on in nano technology.  That's the applications, the--
Speaker 2: Now, what is the quantum hall effect?
Speaker 1: Well, the quantum hall effects, the hall effect is an old idea, and it talks about resistivity, that is how much resistance or particles actually demonstrate when they are in, and at that time, it was all layers devices.  We don't do layers anymore.  We do device, atoms now, but they were in layers devices.  And what happens is that you get, you can get very low resistance, meaning, high speed, when you connect devices, when you try to build a device.  And so this quantum hall effect actually gives you much, much higher speeds than you would ordinarily get in layered devices.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And so he had taken that off the shelf.  He had stopped doing research in that.  And he, and that worked.  I'm sure he got more money after that, but I think, in my little small contract to him, had some effect on him eventually yielding a Nobel Prize.  So that was sort of visionary on my part.
Story_ID: 25091
Speaker 1: Okay--
Speaker 2: And I'm sure he got other monies.  I've seen him several times afterwards.  Of course, we, neither of us could talk about this until now, really twenty years, twenty five years.  And so he recognizes me (laughter).  He's now at Columbia [University].  That's when the old Bell Labs was still, pretty much the old Bell Labs.  But things were beginning to change even in the '80s [1980s] at Bell Labs.  People were beginning to leave for university jobs.  Money was getting tight.  They were cutting, you know, at Bell Labs, you pretty much had had, up until that time, a free for all.  You could pretty much do what it is you wanted to do.
Speaker 1: Yeah, kind of expand a little bit on Bell Labs and its importance in the scientific community?
Speaker 2: Well, Bell Laboratories has been extremely important to scientists.  One of the things that, and this is across the board.  I know a number of minority scientists who were also Bell Labbers (ph.).  Bell had a, in the, starting in the, maybe in the '70's [1970s], they had a graduate fellowship for minority students.  And that fellowship allowed you to go anywhere.  You had no, there were no strings attached.  And so a large number of scientists, many of them younger than me, 'cause they didn't have the, they didn't start this fellowship until the '70's [1970s], went on and allowed them to get PhDs.  They, also, the Bell Lab summer experience was top notch because you had the state-of-the-art facilities, almost in any field that you wanted to work in.  And that gave me, and once you became a staffer at Bell Labs, you decided what it is you wanted to work on.  Nobody, you didn't have bosses.  The research staff at Bell Labs was pretty much given a, if once you got the job at Bell Labs, you were given free for all to do whatever you wanted, within small boundaries.  But, in fact, you had it pretty--we might see it now as a sort of an unlimited budget, as long as it proved the test of some reasonableness.  So pretty much you can do, you could explore almost any idea that had some feasibility with it.  And that is missing.  We now talk about the fact that there's a lack of innovation.  But there's a lack of a place like a Bell Laboratories.  And there's no such thing in America anymore.  And I think Bell Labs, of course, was a, it was an expensive endeavor, but the payoff, the return on the investment was large, not only to AT and T, but to everybody in the United States and the world.
Speaker 1: So was the demise of Bell Labs a direct result of the breaking up of AT and T?
Speaker 2: I think so.  The, absolutely.  They could not, no longer could they--the profits, the amount of profits, even though the baby Bell's still get lots of money.  There's--the old Bell Labs poured a lot more money back into research.  I don't think any of the baby Bells are doing anything even close to what the old Bell, Bell Laboratories.  And the facilities were nice.  It was a place where, you know, I visited, I had an opportunity to visit Bell Labs with people I knew a number of times.  I've sent, later I sent students for summer internships.  It was an internship like no other because they just had access to everything.  It was a free, free kind of environment where thinking, you couldn't do anything but think good thoughts and come up with great ideas 'cause it was a great, it was a great environment, campus like, with no classes (laughter), and no courses to teach.  Just prepare for your next lecture or you prepare your next paper.  So it was a, it was--and that's, and scientists were revered there.  You had, you know, you had a, it was a great place to be and still--well, there's no Bell Labs anymore.
Speaker 1: Is there any place that comes close to being like Bell Labs?
Speaker 2: No, not really.  The IBM facilities also have, I mean at--there was a time in America in which there was sort of an unspoken competition between Bell Labs and the IBM, Thomas Watson Lab.  That doesn't exist anymore, so competition, there's no competition.  And I don't hear very much coming out of IBM either anymore, and not like it was in the '80' [1980s] and even the early '90's [1990s].  The number of patents, innovation, none of that's happening.  We have lost, we are losing the edge, I think, internationally, in that area.  There's no place like it.  The, there are some centers at universities, but again, universities don't have, don't--the emphasis at even the large research universities is not on how many patents you get or making this a product.  That's not the emphasis at our universities.  So it's, and so, and we are--and you see, we can all see that there is a lot less creative, innovative things coming out of science.
Story_ID: 25092
Speaker 1: Now, do, so you worked international and so--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --do governments in other countries fund science to a higher level than we do here?
Speaker 2: Well, there are, I--let me just say to the, some of the Arab nations like Qatar, not Qatar, yeah, Qatar, they have, they're establishing these brand new universities with endowments starting at $10 billion.  So how do we compete with that?  So they are attracting, many top scientists now are being attracted to these positions.  They certainly go on visiting appointments, and it makes for a very nice life.  They don't have, where else can you get those kinds of facilities or not in the United States anymore.  There just came out a report that research universities, top research universities in the United States in the academy report, talking about the fact that they are, we are losing our competitive edge because of lack of funding.  The funding is not here anymore.  We don't have that kind of funding, not even--and certainly, small schools don't have it, but major universities are also suffering in terms of the amount of dollars they have to do research.  So.
Speaker 1: Are we losing American scientists to places like Qatar and--
Speaker 2: Well, some people are going there.  I mean it's a curiosity.  I don't know whether they want to live there, but they certain are, they--I see when I read the 'Physics Today,' almost every month I see very attractive offers, attracting people to come.  And I'm sure people are taking advantage of that.  I do know that, for example, I just recently was working with, and have been involved in the establishment of this center at the University of Arizona, and they had a very top scientist from Finland and one from Germany, both of whom have left in the last two years to go back to their own country because they could get more money, and they got more attractive offers.  And so they left the University of Arizona.  One returned to Germany just last year for a very lucrative professorship at a major research university in Germany and the other one returned to Finland.  And I actually got a chance to visit him just a year ago in Finland, and he has a great facility, a great--makes more money than he does in the United States.  So he did in the United States, and he's back with his family.  So it's happening.  So we're not competitive in that regard, as competitive as we were, say ten, a decade ago because science is not funded at the level that it was before.
Story_ID: 25093
Speaker 1: Okay, well, tell us about Oak Ridge National Laboratories.  I think you were there in the--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I went to Oak Ridge.  I went back, I wanted to get back into science and back into my research.  That was a very--I was a guest scientist there in the metals and ceramics group.  And I did work on the, theoretical work on the aluminides.  And the aluminides are nickel aluminum, titanium aluminum, and, what other systems did I work on?  Nickel aluminum.  We also did, we imbedded these aluminides also with boron and carbon.  And I got to work with Malcolm Stocks, who was a very, well-established scientist.  We published, again, several papers, and I got back--it was interesting that I was getting back into my theoretical research again.  Even though I was up on this field, I had not been publishing.  And so this gave me a chance and that was an interesting year.  I got to, the Oak Ridge group was a very, again, I was the only woman in the group.  But that was, at this time of my career, that was just a given.  There just weren't any women involved in science at the level that I was involved.  And so that was a very interesting year for me, being in Tennessee.  I was, I worked most of the time.  I didn't have very much social life, not that I was looking for it in Oak Ridge, Tennessee (laughter), but it wasn't there even if I did.  So, being, just worked, and I worked every day, seven days a week pretty much.  And so I was, that was a very prolific year, and I think I published three or four papers.  I made two or three presentations.  So I was back into doing theoretical physics.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, in '88' [1988]--now, I don't wanna skip anything, but, now, you were at Oak Ridge from eighty--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was there from '83' [1983] to '85' [1985] or something like that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 25094
Speaker 1: And that's when you went to the National Research Council, right?
Speaker 2: Well, after that, after that.  I was asked, in fact--that I, that job--what was happening, the whole field of material science and engineering, there was this movement to be, to define the field because in the past, what had happened, there were these metallurgist working here, and there were solid state physics people, and there were this, chemists working here.  And so the field hadn't, it hadn't even been defined.  And it was really disaggregated.  So it was a whole movement to come up with major recommendations for a whole new field that we dubbed "material science and engineering".  And I had been working with the metals group, and there were people from Oak Ridge who were involved in that.  And they said, well, you should apply to be the program person.  So I did, and I--that landed me back in policy.  And so I was the principal or senior program staffer at the National Academy for this report.  So there were five groups of over a hundred scientists and I was involved in the selection, in putting these committees together and putting this report together.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay--
Speaker 2: And that defined the field.  So that was from '85' [1985] through '88' [1988].
Speaker 1: So, just once again, you were basically defining the field of material science?
Speaker 2: Yes, and we had all these experts from all these areas come together.  They would meet at the academy maybe once every two months.  Each of them had chairs.  There were five committees.  I have the copy of the report here.  And there were some of the most notable scientists and engineers in the United States.  Again, there were no minority scientists at the academy.  But one of the things I did, I was asked to do when I was at the academy, was to--'cause I did not bring this up.  I think one of the members of the group said, well, why don't we have more women and minorities on these panels?  And so I was asked to put together a list, it was, that was what it became known as, the list of women and minority scientists who could serve on a National Academy board.  And I, within a couple of weeks, came up with a list of maybe twenty or thirty scientists who I thought, who had the background, the research, the academic, the research skills and the background that would make them capable--certainly, as capable as any of the members on any of the current reports.  And that, the interesting thing about that work is that this report did not have--we had, I think one woman on all the reports, and that was Millie Dresselhaus, whom everybody knows.  But the, in later reports at the academy, a lot of the names from that list that I put together got on various panels.  It didn't effect this report, but it had, it did effect other reports after that in the '90's [1990s].  And I've seen some, and I'm sure you've interviewed some of the people who are on these panels.
Speaker 1: More than likely, yep.  Okay, so, in--anything else about the National Research Council?
Speaker 2: No, I was the, I had, I was involved in about four or five reports.  The most notable report is the "Material Science and Engineering" program that I was hired directly for, but I also got involved with the photonics study of--several studies in atomic molecular physics reports.  So I was, again, engaged even though it wasn't hands on writing technical papers.  I was involved in the science again, interacting with scientists from all across the country and some of the most, you know, most noteworthy scientists.
Story_ID: 25095
Speaker 1: Okay, so in 1988, you became Professor of Electro-Engineering at Howard [University], right?
Speaker 2: Yes, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, I guess, I know all these fields are related, but why electro-engineering rather than physics?
Speaker 2: Well, because they gave me a job (laughter).  But the point, that's the nice thing about physics.  You know, I could--I'm not an engineer.  I'm a physicist.  But I certainly know and have subsequently trained a large number of engineers 'cause I have my--the good thing about physics is, it gives you a broad background.  So you can do lots of things.  And so that's really what--so I got a job, was offered a job at Howard [University], and I came to Howard and, in fact, we started, we had, we had a large number of grants, and we were--one of the things that we were a part of was the University of Minnesota super computer facility.  And that was the first parallel processors.  Howard actually got a super computer for the first time that used parallel processing.  That was the big thing in the '80's [1980s] and '90's [1990s], and we got one, a million dollar computer.  And we were able to now do a lot of more complicated research than had ever been done before.  And that was the whole impetus.  That was the Army research initiative, the super computer.  And it was interesting too that the, I had been involved at the CIA in the development of some of these super computer systems.  So it was now nice to be able to use one and buy one and actually--so that was the fruit of my labors in some way to actually be involved in that center at Howard.
Speaker 1: Now, one of your students, I think was Beth A. Brown?
Speaker 2: She was, I knew Beth.  Beth actually died a couple of years ago.  Did you know that?
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: Oh, okay, but Beth was Dr. Gardener's student.  And she was, I knew her and she worked at NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration] Goddard, a very young woman, extremely talented.  I knew her, I did not mentor her, but she was--I knew her through Dr. Gardener, is how I met her.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But she was in Astro.  She actually got her degree in Astronomy, and she worked at, all of her career, short lived, was at NASA Goddard.  She, I heard, I know the American, the National Physical Society, National Black Physicists gave her an award posthumously.  But I still don't know why, the causes of her death.  But she was a young woman in her early, late thirties, early 40s.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: How did you know that?
Speaker 1: Well, they've got a note here.
Speaker 2: Oh, that I knew Beth Brown?
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean I assumed that you were a mentor of hers because--(unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: No, she was, Dr. Gardener, my mentor, was her--she got her degree at Howard.  And I was not her mentor, but Dr. Gardener was, and I met her through him.  I think I met her while she was still an undergraduate at Howard.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And she went on to get her PhD.
Speaker 1: Now, you were at Howard until 1992?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Anything else about that time at Howard?
Speaker 2: Not really, I mean I taught in the engineering, I taught electrical engineers.  I mentored a number of young women.  There, again, there were, at that time at Howard, there was only one other woman on the faculty in engineering at Howard, of about forty faculty in the school.  And that woman was Lorraine Fleming who was in Civil Engineering.  So, and so, but the interesting thing is there were quite a few women students.  And they had, they really had few people who could mentor them because man of the--and this is not uncommon in engineering departments, almost, I would say more than half of the faculty at Howard at the time were foreign nationals.  And so there was a cultural disconnect with these women.  So I got to know a number of very talented young women, especially in electrical engineering, whom I was able to interact with and mentor.  Several, in fact, one young woman who I had met, she was, she--we also had a lot of other projects.  I did a lot of stuff then.  But this young woman was having problems getting a job.  She had a 3.8 GPA in electric engineering, and she'd gone out to two interviews and had not gotten a job.  And she came to me, she came to me, and she said, why am I not getting jobs?  And I said, well, how are you dressing?  And she told me how she was dressing.  And I said, well, you have to change that.  I said, get yourself a blue suit.  I'll go with you.  You know, we can--and get a buttoned up blouse, and we'll, and she did that, and she went on the interview.  And then, [finger snap], she got the job.
Speaker 1: Now, what was dressing as?
Speaker 2: She was, it was more provocative than it should have been.  She was a bit buxom, you know, and she was not--she should have been covering up herself a little better.  She, but no one, no faculty member would tell her that, none of the males are gonna tell her that.  And she managed to get through, and she was a very smart student.  I mean 3.8 in electrical engineering, and she had earned it herself, and, but she was having difficulty when she went to these companies.  And so we had one session, and she got the job, and she came back and hugged me and said, thank you, thank you so much.  But see, that's the kind of thing that, unfortunately, a lot of our students aren't getting these days.  They don't get that--none of the male faculty are gonna tell her, they wouldn't tell her that.  And they'd say, well, it must be something you're doing at the interviews the reason you're not getting the job, which was not the case at all.  It's just that they didn't, the males decided that she would not be a good fit in their group.  That's probably what, and so she was not getting the jobs, and she should have been because based on pure talent, she clearly was over qualified for things she--she was looking at industrial jobs for the most part, not graduate school, which is what I had--I told her she should go to graduate school.  I hope she finally went to graduate school, but that was not, she didn't want to do that right then.
Story_ID: 25096
Speaker 1: Now, 1992, you went to Hampton [University]?
Speaker 2: Yes, I went to Hampton.
Speaker 1: How did you, I mean did they offer you a better position at Hampton?  Or how did--
Speaker 2: Yes, it was a better position 'cause I was going to--Hampton at the time had a, they already had a large, for our schools, a $2 million a year grant from NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration]  to establish an optical physics program.  And I actually got a call from the person who was there at Hampton at the time and asked me, Demetrius Venable, who was at Hampton.  And he was having difficulties to get someone to run this program and to get this PhD program.  And he asked me to come to Hampton, which I thought this was a great opportunity.  I also had, that was a time of my life in which I was making lots of decisions.  I had, I had made the decision just two years before to get married, which I hadn't, you know, hadn't been in the cards really, late, sort of late.  And I said, this would be--and my husband was agreeing to that.  He thought this was a great thing.  So, we went to Hampton in 1992.
Story_ID: 25097
Speaker 1: Okay, now, Dr. Venable is someone that we've interviewed, and he's also from rural Virginia.  He grew up in--
Speaker 2: Yes, well, that, you know, it's interesting that a lot of the, in fact, a large number of black physicists, the early physicists were from Virginia.  And part of that I think we can attribute to the, someone told me, said that you can attribute that to probably the educational system in Virginia because, despite the fact that there were segregated schools in the state, we still had a pretty rigorous curriculum.  Ron Meekins is from Virginia, Harry Morrison was from Virginia, even though Shirley Jackson won't admit it, but she, her family comes right on the outskirts of Virginia.  She just happened to have skipped into the District.  In fact, you know, I had a, at one point, a list of black physicists who were born and raised in Virginia.  It's a large number, a very large number.  It's really, it's sort of striking that the number is so large.  Certainly, I would say the, this is now, even first generation black physicists being the Warren Henry's, the Donald Edwards, a man who was at Virginia State, the first one to get a degree from MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology] and others.  That's the first generation.  Then the second generation was Alex Gardener, and that group.  And then even my generation, third generation physics, a large number from Virginia.  That's where, well, again, you have to look at where the physics departments were.  Virginia State had a, in the '60s [1960s] and '70s [1970s], I know you know Stith--
Speaker 1: James Stith.
Speaker 2: Jim Stith, yeah, Virginia.  We went to the same high school.  So large numbers because of where the colleges were, partly.  Part of it, you had, in Virginia, you had Hampton, Virginia State, Virginia Union in the old days, and probably Norfolk State.  So you had schools, black colleges producing physicists.  So that may be a reason for that, but the numbers are--and North Carolina.  Again, you could go through that list.
Story_ID: 25098
Speaker 1: My name is Larry Crowe.  I'm interviewer with The HistoryMakers.  Our videographer is Matthew Hickey.  Ma'am, can you give us your full name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: My name is Arlene, A-R-L-E-N-E, Paige, P-A-I-G-E, Maclin, M-A-C-L-I-N.
Speaker 1: And, ma'am, what is your date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: My date of birth is June 7, 1945, and my place of birth is Rawlings, Virginia.
Speaker 1: And, ma'am, what is your occupation and title?
Speaker 2: My occupation, I am currently executive director of a Mid-Atlantic Consortium Center for Academic Excellence at Morgan State as well as an adjunct professor of physics.
Speaker 1: Okay, and we are finishing an interview that we started Monday, the 14th of January, 2013, right?
Speaker 2: That is correct.
Speaker 1: And what is today's date?
Speaker 2: Today's date is January 19, 2013.
Speaker 1: And where are we at the present time?
Speaker 2: We're at my house here in Washington, D.C.
Story_ID: 25099
Speaker 1: Okay, now, when we left off, we were talking about, we were at about 1994, and I think you were going to, you were serving as a guest scientist at the NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration] Langley Research Center?
Speaker 2: Yes, that is correct.  I had just finished a stint at Hampton University where I established a PhD program in optics there.  And I was now a visiting scientist at Langley, working with the--that was sort of a very interesting time because I worked with the group of people there at Langley who were actually commercializing many of the patents that had been received by scientists at Langley.  So I got to interview them, work with them.  I worked in the intellectual capital, intellectual properties, a lawyer there, and the whole idea was to begin to commercialize a number of these patents that had been granted to NASA scientists.  I worked with the, several groups on metallic paints, for example, that are used in nuclear facilities.  And we also worked with Dominion Power at that time to begin to look at some of the metal, the ceramic paints that could be used to really deter the amount of corrosion that occurs in these nuclear facilities.  That's a big problem, at many of them.  You wouldn't think so, but it is.  It's quite a problem, and so it turns out that Langley had a number of ceramic metal-based paints that we thought were anti-corrosive.  And so we were working with them, and I think we did get one or two products, one of, some of those paints, actually commercial licensing so that the government again could receive pay off for some of the research that it had had.  There was a group there called the technology transfer group, and I was a part of that group.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, is it--do members of Congress try to keep up with whether or not research, you know, done with government funds is commercialized and can provide a payback to the government?  Do they monitor that?
Speaker 2: Well, it's--in the State of Virginia, I think some of that has happened because the--I was also on the, earlier, I was on the board for the Center for Innovative Technology.  And we worked with research universities.  And that was one of the goals of that center, which was established in the late '80's [1980s].  And so Hampton [University] was not a part of that university group, but it certainly was interested.  It had a president who was sort of visionary in that regarding, wanting to actually turn the research into commercial products.  And that was also in the early '90's [1990s], certainly an interest at NASA-Langley.  I think that group now has been disbanded, but it was a very, it was of a very high focus at that time.  And we were looking at all the patents and actually coming up with applications and potential corporations that could help us commercialize that.  So that was, that is an interest, I think, and it's a good thing when that happens, when actual research, we actually could turn research into real dollars and commercialized products.
Story_ID: 25100
Speaker 1: Okay, now, also in '94' [1994], you were the editor of an article called "Proceedings of the Inaugural RCOP Forum", right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Before the Optical Society, which was published by the Optical Society of America, I guess?
Speaker 2: Yes, that was the, one of the products of the Center for Optical Physics that I really established at Hampton [Hampton University] , we actually had about forty, thirty or forty students to get PhDs.  One of the few historically black colleges that actually had a PhD degree program in physics.  Of course, Howard [University] had been established in 1951, but here it was, Hampton established its physics program in 1992.  And I was really the director who got that program up and running.
Speaker 1: Okay--
Speaker 2: That was quite an interesting forum because for that forum, we brought to top scientists in optics to Hampton for that two-day forum.  There were people from all over the country.  We had people from the optics facilities at the University of Michigan with whom we had already established contact from the Virginia Polytechnic Institute or Virginia Tech as it's called now.  We had, some international scientists came to that forum, so that was a lot of planning, and that proceeding was actually facilitated by one of my colleagues who happened to have been an officer with the Optical Society, Anthony Johnson, who is also an ultra spectroscopist, ultra fast, does ultra fast spectroscopy.  The other interesting thing about that forum was that the lasers that Hampton Institute had, the university had bought, in fact, at that time, were some of the--we were, only five lasers like that in the world.  So we really had a, really a first-class research facility established there.
Speaker 1: Yeah, so this is cutting edge.
Speaker 2: It was very cutting edge.  It was very cutting edge.  In fact, when people came and they saw the lasers that we had, and we--there was a little bit of jealousy.  But we also invited them to come and use these facilities.  And, in fact, a large number of NASA scientists actually came to use the facilities and work with our students there at Hampton, as we were establishing the PhD program, which was a really great thing.  I think, again, as I mentioned earlier, collaboration, we were not trying to compete with the University of Michigan or Virginia Tech or NASA Langley.  We were trying to collaborate, and that was the whole idea of that center.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay--
Speaker 2: And to give our students, also, opportunities to work.  In fact, we had established a very strong collaboration with Coherent at the time, who actually built the lasers.  And, in fact, Coherent actually brought several of our students out at no cost to us, to their facility in California and trained them on the use of the laser.  So that was a very nice, nice collaboration.
Speaker 1: So Coherent is the company--
Speaker 2: Coherent was the company.  They were the, at that time in the '90's [1990s], they made the best lasers in the world, the finest lasers that money could buy or built.  Nobody was competing at the time.  Of course, there's some other companies now that do lasers.
Speaker 1: Okay, I'm glad you said, you mentioned that, because my note didn't show that this was held at Hampton.  This is really, that's really--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --groundbreaking.  So, now, what did you do in 1995?  Was there--
Speaker 2: In 1995, I was in the process of coming back to Washington, D.C. I had, well, I had married in 1990.  My husband made the decision to come with me down there.  He was not very happy, and so we decided to come back to Washington.  And it was a good thing because I think that was a--we did not sell our house here.  This was the house that we lived in, and it's, we could not have come back had we not come at that time.  It was a, it was a sort of a--it was an interesting period, but it was also a period in which we were making a number of transitions, frankly, in our lives.
Story_ID: 25101
Speaker 1: In 1996, you became the senior business developer at--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --Mnemonic Systems, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.  I came back to Washington, and I took this job.  I had never worked for a small company before.  And so this was challenging.  It was interesting.  I was doing very interesting stuff, but one of the things that I have, had developed a knack for is really developing proposals.  And so they needed someone to help them do that.  And I actually led a, the biggest contractor, this small company, they got actually bought out by Nicholas Research several years later.  But in any case, I led the effort for that big contract, which was one of the largest that they had ever--I think it was something like $40 million, but I was one of the, I was "the" lead scientist on it because most of the people in that group were, had business backgrounds, not science backgrounds.  And we were doing computers, large-scale computing, which was my, which is my area of research.  And I knew a lot about it, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, you were there till 1998, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 25102
Speaker 1: And then you worked as a technical consultant at Howard [University]?
Speaker 2: Yes, I came to Howard with, I was there for Dr. Lee.  I worked with Dr. Clarence Lee.  He was the dean of the college.  And he wanted to develop programs.  He was interested in developing programs for the honor students.  And I was instrumental in helping him with that.  In fact, we got a grant from the Sloan Foundation to endow the honors program there, support for a large number of students, and I wrote several other fairly major research grants for the, for Howard University at the time.  And, in fact, that was the continuation of a very long relationship that I had had with Dr. Lee when I had been at Howard in the late '80's [1980s].
Speaker 1: Okay, in, so you were there from '98' [1998] to 2002.
Speaker 2: Yes, from 2002, yes, yeah.
Story_ID: 25103
Speaker 1: Okay, now, did you have any, as a scientist, did you have any trepidation about Y-2K at all?
Speaker 2: Well, let me tell you.  That was, I was involved in a number of proposals.  There was, it was a very lucrative area at the time.  We actually, Howard actually wrote proposals, Mnemonic Systems also had a major proposal.  We got funded.  There was lots of money.  There were over, what?  During that period--I was not necessarily, I guess, when I go back historically, contextually, there was the fear, it was "the" conversation everywhere about the entire collapse of all of our data systems, computers when Y-2K came.  And over $38 billion was spent by the federal government to avoid this, what seemingly was a crisis, which turned out to be nothing at all.  So I think the scare actually fueled the economy to a great deal, and it made a lot of people very well off 'cause a lot of companies came into existence just to take advantage of the Y-2K scare, which turned out not to be anything at all.
Speaker 1: Yeah,--
Speaker 2: It was really sort of a hoax almost, not quite.  You wouldn't call it that, but there was a lot of money spent on what was perceived to be a problem which really was not.  I just wish we could somehow divert that kind of funding that we had at that time to this, which I think is a real scare, is this global warming issue.  That would be, but it was, it turned out not to be--I'm glad it didn't.  It wasn't a--but everybody, including me in some ways--I wasn't terrified by it, but I was very much concerned because having been involved with computers most of my professional life, and it was an interesting time, and to lose all of your data at the strike of the clock was frightening to a lot of people.  And I was in that, I guess in that crowd in some ways.
Speaker 1: Yeah, the Mnemonic Systems was about data--
Speaker 2: Data, yeah, all of it was data, computer analysis data.  We did all of the data for the FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation] systems.  We had a number of systems in which we managed all the data, the data tracking, for example, for firearms, was one of the projects they had.  They had a number of projects with the FBI, mostly FBI work.  But the data tracking, setting up police systems and all that was, that's what we did.  That was the reason for that company.
Story_ID: 25104
Speaker 1: Okay, now, 2002, you're, you serve as professor of Optical Engineering and Director of the IC-CAE program at Norfolk State University?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, in 2002, I--again, I was asked by the, then the person who was at Norfolk State, the dean of the School of Science and Technology, knew that I had a background in optics because we actually were on the same team for a large project that I had helped to establish at Howard [University], the National Science Foundation LSI program.  And Norfolk State actually was a member of that consortium.  So my interactions with this person was only through this board, and she saw how I had, all the stuff I had done, and so she asked me to come and write the proposal for the optical engineering program, which I did.  And I thought that would be the end of it, frankly.  But when I wrote the proposals and we got the program actually approved through the State of Virginia, she asked me would I be interested in coming there to actually implement that program.  And that was a very interesting time, and so I didn't, initially, I did not say, yes.  I said, well, send me what you want me to do or what your vision is, and I'll think about it.  And so when I came back, I went--I think I went off to Brazil for two weeks or three weeks to a meeting.  And when I came back, I had a letter from her, offering me to lead that effort, which I did.  And that turned out to be very, sort of a transformative period in my life.  I told them I would come there for five years 'cause I was not interested in going to Norfolk.  And I actually commuted from here for the, I was there for seven years, rather than five.  And so the interesting thing about that program was the fact that I could actually build up on the efforts and the relations that I had already established with the optics community through the PhD program at Hampton [University].  And so we were the first, "the" first undergraduate, optical engineering program at a historically black college.  Nobody else had that.  And, in fact, immediately, we were one of the few undergraduate optics programs in the country.  And that was the vision of the president who was at Hampton, who had, who was a business person, Marie McDemmon (ph.).  Her idea was that optics is the biggest thing going.  We should involved in it.  That was also a demand of NASA-Langley, and so that was her vision for that program to exist.  And so, pretty much the--I designed the, wrote the proposal for the program, and then I pretty much recruited students.  And the way I recruited students, because we were not known for optics, even though we had, we also had state funding for this program.  So I pretty much went out and handpicked students.  And the first group of students that I had were, the first group of students came in 2003 for that now-approved program.  And the interesting thing about that is that I made, we had, at that time, we had no accreditation.  We had no program.  And so what I did was pretty much on weekends and on my own time, I would go to high schools and I brought students from Brunswick County, rural Virginia.  I went to high schools that nobody else would go to.  And I talked about this program, and pretty much, the first couple of years, it was just my vision.  There, because there was no program.  And so I persuaded the first year, 17 students to come to this program.  And I was so convincing with my dear colleague and friend, whom I could not have done this without, Mary Johnson, who happens to be a mathematician.  And so we went to schools here, around in the Washington area, Prince George's County, for the most part.  Since there was no optics program in the State of Maryland or in Virginia, we got the academic, the higher academic--the Academic Council for Schools, between the two states to agree that since that since there was no undergraduate program in Maryland, that students could come to Virginia for in-state rates.  And the parents actually did that.  They were, they went to the legislature and made that arrangement.  So that became--then, of course, coming to Norfolk State became very attractive for a brand new program, and they could come at in-state rates.  So that cut the costs in half, and the parents did that.  So it was, I got parents involved in the education of their children.  And so the first year, I got, I recruited seventeen students, and the interesting thing about that number is that 94 percent of those students graduated in optics, the optical engineering program.  So we had a success rate that's unheard of.  And part of that was the mentoring, the personal commitment that I made to these students, and, in fact, almost all of those students had internships with places like the University of Michigan, Virginia Tech, the National Laboratories that had optics, and I worked very diligently.  I promised the parents that I would do that, and I kept my commitment to them.  And so the next year, when I went back to recruit students, it became easier.  In fact, I recruited five, for five years, 2003, four [2004], five [2005], six [2006], seven [2007].  And I can't account, there was over a 100, 150 students that came to the optics program alone.  And many of those students have gone on to get--they're either in PhD programs or they finished PhD programs.  They're in medical school or some of them actually--I have one student who actually did what I said I would do if I had my life to live over again.  And I said, I would still do physics, but I would probably do patent law.  And so he went, he got his Masters degree with me in physics, I mean in optics physics--optical physics, optical engineering, and went on to get a degree in law at the University of Kansas.  And he's here, I think, now working as a lawyer in the Patent Office.  But, so that was a very interesting period.  In fact, and I met my--I reestablished connection with a colleague with whom we have had a very prolific and productive research.  We did, we've published a number of papers on this activity which we called the integrated curriculum.  And one of the things that that does is it actually allows people to, allows students early on to see the connections that mathematics actually makes with the other scientists.  And that's extremely important, I think, as a tool to retain our students because many students take calculus, but they have no idea how to use it.  And I also, I bring back my early times, for me, growing up, as I've said earlier in this discussion here, that I knew I loved mathematics, but I didn't know how to apply it until I took physics.  And so many of our students today have the same problem.  They don't know, they might like calculus, but why do I need to know this.  And so what we did was actually to, early on to defer, from their freshman year, they got practical experiences in how to, how mathematics, how important mathematics was and how they use it.  And, in fact, we actually had companion classes where they--we didn't change the curriculum at all.  What we did was to actually teach the classes in tandem.  So example, for example, if a student were taking calculus, we taught them the physics concepts that they needed to use this calculus for.  So they got it right away, and we did the same thing with chemistry and material science.  And then we also, the whole idea of how to be a good writer, we actually integrated the introduction to engineering class, which I taught for the first, the years that I was there, five years, and English.  So we actually, these courses were, we called it the integrated curriculum.  And I think it's still a very effective approach.  And it was a, it was really quite a successful program.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's the integrated curriculum.
Speaker 2: Integrated curriculum.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We have published a number of papers on that.  My colleague, my colleague's name with whom I worked very closely, and still work, is, her name is Dr. Camellia Okpodu.  She happens to be a biologist.
Speaker 1: Okay, and Dr.--how do you spell her last name?
Speaker 2: O-K-P-O-D-U.
Speaker 1: O-K-P-O--
Speaker 2: Camellia, C-A-M-E-L-L-I-A.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 25105
Speaker 1: Now, in 2004, there's an article in the "Los Angeles Times" about the, I guess the higher profile that women were taking in the physics, the world of physics, and they quoted you as saying there's still probably only thirty black women with physics PhDs in the whole country--
Speaker 2: That--
Speaker 1: --which boils down to maybe one percent or something?
Speaker 2: Well, it turns out that the numbers, that was--was I interviewed?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I think I was interviewed at a professional meeting of, I know a photographer, a reporter pulled me over.  And we talked, and the problem, of course, that was in '92' [1992], there's still--we have produced, the first PhD in physics was Shirley Jackson in 1974, and we got our degrees within six months of each other.  I got my degree, in fact, there was sort of a race.  And there's been probably about one per year since that time.  And it has not, in fact, it has not gotten better.  It's gotten, it hasn't--the condition for women of color and especially, African American women, has really not improved very much in the field of physics.  We still, we're not--most physics departments don't have women or any woman.  They don't have any women, many of them don't have any women, very much like the environment that I found at the University of Virginia that had only one woman when I was there, and she was not in my field.  I don't remember her, but there was only one woman there.  And that's generally--women and certainly women of color, have still remained, even today, isolated in some ways from the larger community because of our small numbers.  We are the only one in an environment typically, and whatever environment that is.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, let's see, now, so you were Hampton until--
Speaker 2: I was at Hampton [University] until--I was really sort of at Hampton until '96' [1996] when I left Hampton.  I still had collaborations.  One of the scientists whom I brought to Hampton, Don Lyons, I still worked with him.  We still collaborated on mentoring students.  He was a very prolific scientist.  One of the best decision I made, I think is when I was director of that research center was to bring Donald, to hire him 'cause he was serious about science.  He was a very good, an excellent experimentalist.  He understood how to use all the lasers that we had, and he trained probably about 10 or 15 of the PhD students that actually got their degrees through that program.
Speaker 1: I'm sorry, I meant to say Norfolk State, and that's where (laughter), that's where I messed up, but Norfolk State [University], you were there from 2004--
Speaker 2: From 2002 to 2009.
Speaker 1: Two thousand nine [2009], okay, 2009, at Norfolk State, okay.  And, let's see, tell us about, now, what is, 'cause I don't have the translation of this here, the DNIMAS program?
Speaker 2: Oh, the DNIMAS program as it's called.
Speaker 1: DNIMAS, okay.
Speaker 2: It's the Dozoretz National Institute for Mathematics and Applied Science at Norfolk State [University].  And that program is the honors program.  It was actually endowed with a small, very small endowment in 1985, and it was one of the first programs that actually gave students, certainly at Norfolk State, full scholarships for them to go on to get PhDs in science, technology, engineering and mathematics.  And, in fact, that program predates the Meyerhoff program, which is, everybody knows about at University of Maryland, Baltimore County.  So while I was at Norfolk, I actually got a grant from the National Science Foundation to do the longitudinal study of that program.  It was the first time that anything really had been made public about that program, even though they had a rather amazing success rate.  Seventy two [72] percent of the students graduated in that program in an environment at Norfolk State that had an actual graduation rate of something like 26, 27 percent.  But these students got full scholarships, more than half of them went on to get PhDs, and MDs, but the whole idea at the time was that we were doing pretty well in terms of getting students to go into MD programs.  How do we now, despite the fact that the NIH had been funding the minority biology higher-education program for a number of years, students were still going into medicine, and not into PhD degrees.  So this program was aimed at getting more students to focus on the PhD degree.  And it was, it's been, it has been and still exists today.  It's been very successful in getting students to go on to PhD programs.
Story_ID: 25106
Speaker 1: All right, in 2006, you were awarded a five-year, $2.3 million grant from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence for the project titled, "Internationally Diverse Education in Area Studies or Ideas".
Speaker 2: That was a very seminal grant for what I had been telling students I wanted to happen at Norfolk State [University] if they came to the optical engineering program.  And I told them three things.  I told them I wanted them to have--as undergraduates, I wanted them to have three different kinds of summer internships.  And one was a, was at, would be at a national laboratory.  One would be at a major research university, and the other was an international program.  Now, when I came to Norfolk in 2002, I had absolutely no clue as to how to do the international component.  There was no, or very little, global education.  But I did know how to do the other two.  So the major universities, I had contacts and established contacts with national laboratories.  So students were getting those internships.  Most of my students, typically, I became known as almost the internship specialist because I got students internships when others could not.  And so most of my students spent a summer at three or four laboratories and most of those laboratories had established relationships at Argonne National Laboratory, Oak Ridge National Laboratory where I spent time.  I, Cal-Berkley [University of California, Berkeley], I sent a large number of students.  And, of course, NASA-Langley.  So most of the student whom I had contact with got those experiences.  But in 2006, and this goes back, I guess, again to my earlier career where I had spent time at the Central Intelligence Agency, and there was this competition coming out for these centers.  I got invited in 2005 to come to a summer seminar that was headed up by a person by the name of Dr. Lenora Gant who actually was the head of this program, and this program was the first time that it actually had been advertised to the larger public.  And so I invited the people from OD and I, the Office of Director of National Intelligence to come to Norfolk [State University] to a meet with our faculty and administrators in November, 2005.  And, effectively, I waited for this announcement to come out.  And when it came out, I wrote a proposal, and we got the funding.  And that was seminal, I think, in terms of the global component of the program that I had envisioned because it allowed us to have, for example, there was--until, since, until that program came into existence, there really had been no emphasis on strategic languages.  And so we introduced Arabic, Chinese and Japanese.  Students got that.  And also, we introduced a global component, culturally emerging, where students went to Morocco.  They went to Egypt.  They went to Tunisia.  I had students, and that's for the Arabic portion of the program.  We introduced Arabic.  We also introduced Chinese and Japanese and students also went to China.  And I accompanied students to these places.  Most, many of the students, almost none of them had ever had any international experience, but the intelligence community was very interested in having science students that also had an international component to their education.  And, in fact, I couldn't produce enough of these students.  Before they could even finish their degrees, the Intelligence communities snapped up a large number of these students, especially, the Central Intelligence Agency wanted to hire everybody.  But I told them--and many of the students, with my tough persuasion, I told them they needed to go on and get the--not that they should not consider the Intelligence community, but they should go ahead and get their PhD.  And, in fact, the director, Dr. Gant, as I mentioned, was very amenable to that because she said, this program is not just good for the intelligence community.  It's good for America.  That was one of her favorite expressions.  It's good for America, that we have now this globally educated group of students.  And that is what many historically black colleges do not have because even today, only one percent of American students who go abroad are people of color, less than one percent.  And they, the numbers, even for all Americans, is only 300,000 students a year.  So it's still a very small number for all Americans, but only less than 3,000 students go abroad.  And so through that program, actually, we have actually funded almost a hundred students through that program alone for an international component.  And I must say that every student who participated in that program has been transformed.  Their outlook on their career choices has been broadened and expanded.  And many of them have taken jobs in the Intelligence community or with corporations, like Booze Allen who are major advisors to the Intelligence community.  So they, it's been transformative for a large number of students.
Story_ID: 25107
Speaker 1: Okay, now, in 2007, you presented at the "Frontiers in Education" conference in Milwaukee, two papers.  One, "Evaluative Research Study of a STEM Honors Program" and the second one was "Globalization of the Engineering Curriculum".
Speaker 2: Yes, well, that--again, that's the work that I had mentioned earlier.  The STEM paper was on the honors program at Norfolk State [University].  It was the first time that any paper had been produced, and that was a result of the, also an NSF [National Science Foundation] grant that I got.  So it had not been public at all, and we also got publicized this program and disseminated this information with the National Public Radio.  We had an interview with National Public Radio on "Women in Science", and so, and we've--my colleague and I, again, Camilla Opodu (ph.), we've published a number of papers on that program as well as this integrated curriculum that I mentioned earlier.
Speaker 1: Okay, in 2008, you and Dr. Camilla Opodu co-edited "Defining the Role of Intelligence in Islamic Studies Programs for the Twenty-First Century Workforce in America".
Speaker 2: Yeah, that also was, I think, a, it was a great symposium.  Never before had we brought together people who were Islamist with the Intelligence community.  That was the first time that it had happened.  And we had four key-note speakers.  We had Baroness Caroline, from England, I mean who was, had done a lot of stuff, work in the England on Islamic affairs, written several books.  We also had a person who was an expert Ambassador Kenneth Krill, who was Ambassador to Islamic countries with the State Department.  We also had the General from Langley, and we had also a scholar in Islamic studies from Australia.  So we had a really, two-day feast, and we brought together large numbers of people who had never talked to each other before.  So it really was, in a lot of ways, very seminal, and was, of course, that set the tone for the, that colloquium that we actually hosted at Norfolk State, set the tone for the colloquium for this whole new program that Gant had envisioned and was doing.  So she used that program as sort of the exemplar for all of the other, what the other schools should be doing.  So that was quite a nice thing.  And we have, we had proceedings of it as well--
Speaker 1: Okay--
Speaker 2: --that have been widely disseminated.
Story_ID: 25108
Speaker 1: Alright, now, in 2009, you published "Nonlinear Magneto Optical Effects in Dielectrics (ph.) Embedded with Pharo-Magnetic Nano Particles" in the proceedings of the Second Annual Seminar on Theoretical Physics and National Development in the "African Journal of Physics".  I didn't know there was an "African Journal of Physics" and a lot of people don't know.
Speaker 2: Well, let me just tell you.  This is, my colleague with whom I had worked with early in my career, Alex Animalu, and whom I had met at Lincoln Laboratories, we published several papers in the late '70s [1970s] on pseudo-potential theory.  And so he invited me to come to this Second Annual Meeting.  In fact, Alex Animalu, and I think I mentioned his name several times before, was, is the--one of the foremost scientists, physicists in all of Nigeria.  And he invited me to come to give a talk to about 300 students from all over Nigeria.  They were from the University of Nsukka, Delta State University.  It sounds like a university right here in the United States, Delta State.  But it happens to be in the delta of Nigeria.  And so he invited me to come, and that was really quite a nice meeting.  I got to meet, where else, I said, where else in the world could I meet 300 students, all of who were studying physics?  Probably nowhere else.  And so it was really a very interesting four days.  I had never been to Nigeria.  I had been to most other places in the world, but never Nigeria.  So we spent a very fruitful time, and the only tragedy is a large number of these students wanted to come to the United States.  They wanted to come to the United States for graduate school.  And I was not able to give all the students opportunities.  But I have made some connections for some of the students to come here for graduate work, even though, for example, Nsukka and several other universities in Nigeria have well established doctorial programs.  Most of the problems in physics in Nigeria are theoretical because they just don't have the state-of-the-art facilities like we have here.  So almost all of the physics programs in Nigeria are, produce theorists.  And that's what Alex is, and so he's been a, he's produced a large number of students.  And many of the students at this conference were, in fact, his students or other, students of his students.  So he was sort of the grandfather of physicists there in Nigeria.
Speaker 1: Okay, Dr. Alex Animalu.
Speaker 2: Animalu.
Story_ID: 25109
Speaker 1: In 2011, you taught as an adjunct professor of physics at Morgan State University but you were also the executive director of--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Well, now, what does MAC-CAE stand for?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's the Mid-Atlantic Consortium Center for Academic Excellence.  I left the Intelligence community project at Norfolk [State University] and my colleague and friend, Camilla Opodu has run that program, and, in fact, I think the funding has run out.  But when the next broad agency announcement came out, we were asked to submit a consortium proposal that would include Norfolk State, Elizabeth City State, and Bowie State and Morgan [State] as the lead institution.  And so we now have a similar center to the one that was established first at Norfolk in 2006 with the focus now on Southeast Asia.  That is an area of interests to the Intelligence community, and so the languages that we have for that program are Hindi, Urdu and Bengali.  We have introduced as a result of that program, we introduced Hindi to all of the consortium schools last year.  And 13 students went to India to the Jaipur last summer to learn Hindi, and the good news here is that we're having another competition this year.  The program is progressing.  We were hosted by the State Department with 140 students back in November, and so the word is getting out that, really--and I think this is really, it may be one of my signature moments or one of the things that I believe is my legacy, is that the acquisition for scientists of another culture or another language is going to be critical as we move into a very globalized economy.  It is unlikely that many scientists will ever just work in the United States anymore.  It is more likely that we will work across countries.  Now, of course, as scientists, we all have been extremely fortunate to travel pretty much all over the world at somebody else's expense.  But I think the next generation of scientists, not only will they travel to these countries and give papers, but they also will work in China or they'll work in India or they'll work in Japan or Egypt.  I think we really, if we're really talking about a global workforce, then language is critical.  And that's one of the areas I think that many historically black colleges still need to increase the number of languages that they actually offer and really, truly have a globally educated student body.  And we can't do that with five or ten students.  It really needs to be a large number of students who are actually participating in the global experiences early on in their career because it is a transformative experience.
Speaker 1: Okay--
Speaker 2: It was transformative for me when I went to Germany as a sophomore--a junior, and I think its transformative now for our students as they study and acquire strategic language.
Story_ID: 25110
Speaker 1: Okay, now, on our questionnaire, you stated that of all the things you've done, you were especially pleased by the number of African American male students who you've mentored over the past decade or so?
Speaker 2: Yes, I had, at--one of the issues that I saw at, when I was at Norfolk [State University] was that even in our engineering, for whatever reason, the male students seemed to not have the, they seemed to not have the--let me just say, the focus for the field, many of them.  Some of them did.  But many of them did not have the focus that they needed to be successful in the field of science and engineering.  And so I made it a special effort, and much of this, of course, very few people even know about.  I pretty much gave students personal scholarships.  That is, I wrote checks to students, male students mostly.  If I had grant money, I would make a special effort to keep them in school.  And so over the last decade, I would estimate a small number.  I've helped over a hundred, young African males finish their degrees.  And many of them, most of them stayed in, I'm proud to say, most of these young males actually stayed in science and engineering, whereas, many of them would have to have dropped out of school because they just didn't have the money.  They had to get a job.  I had missed young men, and I never, never asked them to give me proof of their story.  I supported them in any way I could just based on their personal story.  And I think that was, so they knew that they could come to me in confidence and tell me their story.  I would not discuss it with anybody else.  But if I could, they knew that I was a source, I became a source of support of young, a large number of young males.  And they, I mean they come to me now, they said, many of my male students say, well, if you go to Dr. Maclin, it's tough love, but she'll help you if she can.  And so that, a very proud moment.  And I have large numbers of young males who will tell you that.  I think that's part, one part of my legacy.  And I also have a large number of young males who have gone on and gotten their degrees and who have several now.  The last crop of students that I recruited at Norfolk are now in PhD programs all over the country.
Speaker 1: Okay, that kind of leads us to the discussion of your legacy because you kind of mentioned it, but what today would you consider as your greatest achievements?
Speaker 2: My greatest achievements, I would say, again, would my--I think I have inherited a skill for teaching that not many people are--we have to stop [mic pulled off]--
Speaker 1: Oh, the mic. (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Speed.
Speaker 2: Okay, go ahead.
Speaker 1: I would say one of the things that I have inherited, I believe, a gift for teaching.  I think I'm an excellent teacher, and not only my students tell me that, but also I have colleagues who say that.  And one of the things that I do, typically when I am teaching is that, very much like you have done for this interview.  I try to make the students relax.  So we start off by laughing, typically, for 30 seconds.  So we start off, and then everybody's relaxed.  When you laugh, of course, you are relaxed, and students learn better.  So I make the learning environment one that's comfortable for the student.  The other thing that I, and certainly my mentor, Dr. Gardener did an excellent--I, in no way will ever be the teacher that he was.  But he also taught through examples, and the contextual manner, meaning that whatever physics concepts he was talking about, he could always relate it to something that we had some kind of personal experience with, which is a very powerful way to teach.  And especially, I think that's especially critical when we are trying to teach science because science for a large number of minority students, of course, is a foreign language in itself.  And so we have to relate this science.  Why do you do the science?  That's why the, I think the integrated curriculum was so effective because students could see exactly why they needed to learn this mathematics.  How is it important?  What is this gonna do for me?  What are the payoffs?  These are the questions that students ask very early on, and if they don't see payoff early, they often leave the field.  And so, somehow, and that's a challenge today.  And, in fact, I'm thinking about this question very seriously right now because I'm in the midst of writing a proposal to talk about, again, to the National Science Foundation, to talk about how do we take advantage of the students now having incredible knowledge of the mobile technologies, the iPad, the iPhone, how do we now formalize that knowledge that they have, that they bring to the classroom?  How do we make that a formal mechanism for learning science and keeping them engaged in the science and technology fields?  That's one of the challenges I think we all, as educators, have, and it's one of them that I would like to get more involved in than I am now, and I'm writing, in fact, this fairly large proposal to the National Science Foundation to do that, right now.  It's due in another three weeks or so.
Story_ID: 25111
Speaker 1: Okay, now, when you look back on everything you've done to this point, is there anything major that you would do over again or wish you hadn't done?
Speaker 2: Not really.  I think everything that I've done has led to something else, and so I wouldn't, I would not change--if I had to relive my life, I wouldn't change very much.  I've had, despite the fact that I came along as a woman early on, I have had--and have taken advantage of incredible numbers of opportunities, what I would like to tell students today is that there're so many more opportunities to people who are now in science than there were to me when I came along.  But I've had incredible mentors all the way.  At every stage of my life I've had mentors who've guided me.  And the other thing I would like to leave and say that a mentor--in fact, you can have several, three or four different kinds of mentors, I believe.  It's not just somebody in your field.  But you can have mentors outside of your field.  And I urge my students to talk to people, both--for all kinds of problems, talk to people outside of their field who can also serve as mentors.  And I've had, been just a very lucky, I think, to have been--having such good mentors throughout my career, and who've guided me, who've given me the right advice most of the time on what I should do next or how I should do it.  And I think, I don't think, I think--I tell, I also tell my students that no matter where a scientist is in their field, whether they're a Nobel Prize Laureate or they're an assistant professor, you can always learn something from them.  And they also are always pleased when you ask.  That's the take away, and I've had students to do that.  I said, most physicists still respond to their own emails.  So we're hands on.  So if you would write to, if you write to a scientist or engineer and tell them that you're interested in their work or do they have something that they would like to share with you, you're writing a paper, they will, more than likely, you will get a response.  And it happens almost always.  And that's the good thing about science.  We still respond in a personal way to our students.
Story_ID: 25112
Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: My concerns are that our numbers in physics, especially--let me just give you this data.  In 1968, there were nineteen PhD physicists produced.  In 2008, there were thirty five.  This is per year.  So even in almost, in my entire career, the numbers of African Americans--this is total, this is male and female, the numbers of African American physicists has not even doubled, getting PhDs.  And that's a serious concern.  And, of course, as I mentioned earlier, we have produced, since the 1974, about one per year, women, African American women.  So if you just count the years, there were, in 1974, there were none, and then in 19--2013, just count the years, so about thirty nine or forty.  And that's a pretty good count.  It's still about less than forty African Americans with PhD degrees in physics.  And so we need to change that.  And I do know that the American Physical Society has just gotten a grant, and I'm in touch with them, and I've offered to work with them in any way that I can to help with that grant, bridges to the doctorate program.  In fact, and I'm meeting with people next week at the National Science Foundation to talk about how do we get students from the Bachelors degree to the PhD degree.  I've sent a concept paper.  So that's one of my concerns.  We need to, we've got to increase these numbers, and make physics more attractive.  Typically, and this is research universities as well as small, minority colleges, are producing one, two, three majors a year.  That's not, that's not going to make it.  We cannot, we can't continue that way.  So we have to--physics is, again, the most fundamental of all of the sciences.  And I have, I've also said that we should actually be, physics should be the first language, meaning the first science, not the last, in high school.  We teach it last, not first because it is the most fundamental of all the sciences.  And if we taught physics first, I think we would have more numbers.  We'd, maybe our numbers would be closer to what biology is.  But we teach it last, and in high school.  So we have the smallest numbers, for the most part.
Story_ID: 25113
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, now, are--now, what are your future plans?  Now, you're close to retirement (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Well, no, I'm probably gonna work until I'm seventy five or so.  I'm enjoying doing what I'm doing right now.  I'm, I would like to be teaching more, and that's in the plans.  I'm hoping at Morgan [State University] to be more involved, one-on-one with students.  I haven't done that in the last couple of years.  I've more just managing projects, but I really am, I'm most comfortable teaching students.  I think that's my legacy.  I, my students say that--the other thing is, I have a theory, and the theory is that, that to be a good mentor, one has to have been mentored themselves.  It's very difficult, and that's one of the things that's missing, I think, from a large number of my younger colleagues.  And I talk to them often, and they say, you know, I've never been mentored like you talk about, the way you talk about the relationships that you've had or established with your teachers and your faculty.  I don't, I've never had that in graduate school, not even with my thesis advisor.  And one of the things I did at Norfolk also was to mentor the younger faculty.  I, and my colleague, Camilla Opodu, we helped a large number of untenured faculty to write their first proposal, to get research grants and funding, and especially, the women faculty.  We worked with them very closely, but we also helped men as well.  We help young, young faculty in general, and that's one of, that was one of her projects that I worked with her very closely on, to get--and we just, proposal writing is an art.  It takes a lot of time.  But it's the way to make it in the university.  If you're gonna be involved in research, you have to write proposals and get external funding which is tougher and tougher to get, of course, these days.
Story_ID: 25114
Speaker 1: Do you think things are changing in terms of the proportion of time that is spent on research and teaching in the black colleges today?
Speaker 2: No, unfortunately, that is also--many faculty at small colleges, not just historically black colleges, still spend an incredible amount of time teaching.  They have a full course load.  And it's very difficult to get established as a researcher with that kind of course load.  Also, the thing that many schools that are better resourced have advantages that they actually give faculty a sabbatical.  Very few faculty at historically black college, they don't have the money to actually provide support for sabbaticals.  And that's something that really needs to happen.  We really do, there needs to be a true integration of research and education.  And it's gonna be very difficult to be a good teacher when you're not involved in research, where you don't have time to sit and read papers and go to the library and many of us who manage to do research, do that on our own time.  It's, and you don't have a lot of your own time when you're teaching four classes every semester.  There's not a whole lot of your own time, especially, if you have a life, any kind of family life or social life.  And, again, many women scientists that I know have, they have--many of them don't have families, children.  They don't have children because they've made the major sacrifice to, for their career in physics and science and doing science.  That's changing.  Women now say, I need, I want to have it all.  And they can, but you have to work a little harder, I think.  It's hard to manage.
Story_ID: 25115
Speaker 1: Tell us a little bit about your family.  I know you got married late in life.
Speaker 2: Yes, I did.  I, in fact, my early career, I was pretty much completely devoted to career.  I didn't, I really never had any strong interests in having children of my own.  And, in fact, I thought I would, I really didn't think I would get married, to tell you the truth.  But this happened, my mother who was a very strong force in my life--I was also very devoted to my mother, especially in her later years.  And when I was at Howard [University], in fact, in the late '80s [1980s], she became ill, and I would go home every weekend to manage her affairs and make sure that she had--I had someone to come and help her during the week.  And I was there every weekend.  And so she said to me, on one of these weekends, she said, "I really worry about you Arlene.  You're by yourself.  You don't have anybody, and you're on the road all the time", you know, traveling back and forth.  So I said to her, and this is a true story, I said to her, I said, well, I don't know how I'm gonna meet anybody.  I'm just too busy.  And she said, and I said, well, you need to pray for me.  That's exactly what I said.  And I left that weekend.  And about six months later, I actually met the man whom I married, Donald Addison.  And it's, it's very interesting because I had known him as a--he was an icon at North Carolina A and T when I was a student there because of his activities with the Civil Rights Movement.  He had been a strategist for the sit-in at North Carolina A and T [North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University] in Greensboro.  And he was actually a faculty member that everybody knew because of his action with the sit-in movement.  And I had not seen this man from the, from 1964--he left A and T at the end of my freshman year and went off with his family, I learned later, to Racine, Wisconsin, where he was the executive director for the Urban League and worked with Whitney Young and others.  And when I was, came to the campus in, Howard's campus in 1988, I was teaching a summer course there--this was also during that period.  And I, he remembered me as a student because I was, even though I was a freshman, I was pretty, everybody knew me because I was a hard worker, student, and he said, what are you doing?  This is twenty five years later.  I said, well, I'm teaching a course here at Howard this summer.  And I said, what are you doing?  He said, oh, I'm widowed, and I'm here teaching, and so all of our lives had changed.  And so I met him, that was within the six-month period, and we were married within a year.  And that was my mother's, my mother, that was, I say, that was her doing.  And so we, and I did the big wedding, and you'll see some pictures in a few minutes because my mother has had five daughters, and she'd never seen the big wedding.  So I did the big one for her.  So that's the, pretty much--and we had a very, unfortunately, that was, my marriage was only eleven years because my husband died in 2011, I mean 2001, I'm sorry.  But at least my mother got to see a proper marriage in 1990, and I think we had a very good marriage, even though short.  But he was also a professor of sociology and again, in lots of ways, he was also a mentor.  It's hard to think of a husband who is also a mentor.  But in lots of ways he was.  He was, he loved to read.  In fact, his library is upstairs.  He was, he was good with his students.  They all loved him.  He was very popular, he was a very popular teacher at Howard University, and he had been brought there by the president, President Cheek brought him as one of the people he wanted to transform Howard in the '80's [1980s].  So he was, so that's pretty much that.
Speaker 1: Okay, well, is there anything we haven't talked about before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: I think we've covered, we've pretty much--you've pretty, you've been very thorough.  In fact, I was sort of, as a part of this interview, I was saying, where did he get all this information.  But you've done your research well.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Y'Hoshua Murray in Chicago [Illinois], that's, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 25116
Speaker 1: Ma'am, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: I would like to be remembered--you mean, this is when I die, to the rest of the world?  I would like to be remembered as a person who was caring and nurturing to her students, was a good mentor and who also loved life in lots of ways, that I enjoyed the fullest that life has to offer.
Story_ID: 25117
Speaker 1: Okay, we are, I have--as I have mentioned, I have very little, very few or no pictures of my early childhood.  And so these, this is a picture of the braces that I wore from very early on, up until about five years old.  And so, I've always had special shoes, and so this is the, these are the, this is a picture of the early years.
Speaker 2: Next one.
Speaker 1: Oh, you're gonna do them out of order?
Speaker 2: Yeah, the order doesn't matter.
Speaker 1: It doesn't matter.  Okay.  This is a picture of me at my confirmation at 36 years old with my next door neighbor of 22 years, Fay Lucatordo (ph.).  She was like a mother to me.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: This is a picture of me almost on the same day with my sponsor in the Episcopal church, Mary Ellen Ferry, who was my sponsor into the church.
Speaker 2: This is a picture of me on that same day with my mother who is in the center, and her sister, who's on the right of her, and her--my mother's, my father's sister on the left of her.  These were the last two aunts that I had.  These were also the youngest, my youngest sister for my mother and the youngest sister for my father.
Speaker 1: This picture--
Speaker 2: Could you name them?
Speaker 1: Yeah, you could name them.
Speaker 2: The one on the right, Alberta Campbell.
Speaker 1: Let's go left from--like you're reading.
Speaker 2: Oh, left, this is my Aunt Nanny Thornton, my father's youngest sister, my mother, Alice Maclin, and my Aunt Alberta Campbell, her youngest sister.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: This is a picture of, a high school picture of me graduating from high school.  And the interesting thing to note on that picture is I actually say I wanted to be a research scientist.
Speaker 1: This is a picture of me and a colleague.  We were in graduate school together, Annie Barnes, who was at a PhD program at the University of Virginia, getting her PhD in Anthropology.  And I got my graduate degree, so this is a picture of the two of us.
Speaker 2: This is a wedding picture of me and my husband, Donald Addison, and we had the wedding that Queen Elizabeth the first never had.  So it was a historically correct wedding (laughter).
Speaker 1: This is a picture of me with the students at Hampton University, and the interesting thing about this picture is that all of these students went on to get, all of these people who were students, some of the people in the back were a couple of faculty.  But all of these students went on to get PhDs in physics.  That was in 1992.
Speaker 2: This--
Speaker 1: Yeah, the paper is kind of, it's (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, that's, yeah, that just--I had those printed.  This is a picture, in 2004, I started going to South Africa, and this is a picture of me, and I took students with me.  This is the first trip to South Africa, a visit both to a science school in the township of Kilisha (ph.) and then a private school.  And I want you to see, the reason I have both of those pictures on that thing is I want you to see the difference between the township students and the students--or colored students when they went to private schools.  It's a, so that's the contrast.
Speaker 1: This is a picture of me as a hunter.  I'm an avid hunter, and I started hunting in 1974, when I was in graduate school, but I, but hunting was always a part of our life.
Speaker 2: This is the picture that I'd like for you to use as the photo.  This is sort of my official portrait now that I use for almost everything.
Speaker 1: This is a picture of, again, my first time in South Africa, where I'm actually lying in the cell of Mandela--Nelson Mandela and even I, at 5'1", I'm cramped in this space.  And so just imagine how he must have been cramped as a--
Speaker 2: Yeah, he's about 6'4"--
Speaker 1: Six four or 6'2", yeah, something like that.  That's (unclear)
Speaker 2: I know he's tall.
Speaker 1: This is a picture of me at the top, in fact, just do the top picture, I think, and probably not the bottom picture, of me with the Dean of St. George's Cathedral in Cape Town.  There, again, my first time there.  He was the dean of the Cathedral there.
Speaker 2: This is a picture of me and my colleague, I mentioned several times, Camilla Opoedu with Senator Miller, who, in the State House in Richmond.  We went down to tell her about our Intelligence Community Center for Academic Excellence, just after we got it funded.
Speaker 1: This is a picture of me in 2009 with the large number of--Dr. Alex Animalu is standing there beside me but the students from all over Africa had this meeting, some of them.  It's not the whole group, but some of the students in this conference I went to later.  I was an invited guest speaker.
Speaker 2: What year is this?
Speaker 1: Two thousand nine [2009].
Speaker 2: This is a picture of me with the first group of students who went to China with, at the National Science Foundation Chinese Office.  And in front, beside me, is Dr. William Chang who was the director of that center in China, National Science Foundation Center in China.
Speaker 1: This is a picture of students again, from township schools.  We're recruiting them at the Hermaness National Laboratory, and these students walked every day from their school to the center because their principal wouldn't allow them to have hands-on science.  And the bottom picture is a picture of me with my husband's best friend, John Kilimanjaro, and he was also very active in the Civil Rights Movement.  This a picture about 2006, after--
Speaker 2: And John Kilimanjaro is an African American?
Speaker 1: Yes, he is.  He's standing there to the left, yes.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And he was very much engaged, and he has, he's the publisher of a newspaper in, "The Carolina Peacemaker" in Greensboro.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And he was also a faculty member.
