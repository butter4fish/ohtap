Speaker 1: My name is Larry Crowe.  I'm interviewer today with The HistoryMakers. Our videographer is Matthew Hickey.  And we have some observers which I'll identify at the next--the next reel 'cause I didn't get (laughter) everybody's name right.
Speaker 2:  	Okay.
Speaker 1: But sir, can you please state your full name and spell it for us please?
Speaker 2:  	Okay. Joseph Henry Geeter, III [HistoryMaker Joe Geeter, III].  Last name is G as in George, E-E-T as in Tom, E-R, Joseph Henry Geeter, III.
Speaker 1: Now is there a story behind your name?
Speaker 2:  	Well I'm the third so I'm named after my father [Joe Geeter, Jr.] and my grandfather [Joe Geeter, Sr.] before me.  So I'm very proud of that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2:  	So--
Speaker 1: Now Geeter is a name you don't hear that much so is there a story (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2:  	(Simultaneous) Not too many Geeter families.  I did some amateur research a little while ago and found there was less than two hundred Geeter families in the United States at the time.  And I was pretty amazed out of the City of New York [New York] with 7 million people, there was not one Geeter listed.  So Geeters are mostly concentrated in Memphis, Tennessee and New Orleans [Louisiana].  That's where my grandfather's father and his people were from.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2:  	So we think it's a mixture of--it's a Creole, with a little French, a little African, a little something else in there.  So--
Speaker 1: Okay, I mean you know you're tempted to say (pronunciation) Geeter when you say--
Speaker 2:  	And many people pronounce it (pronunciation) Geeter.  As a matter of fact, in Memphis, half the family say Geeter, the other half say Geeter.  And so there's a school down there called Geeter Middle School [Memphis, Tennessee].  Now--it was Geeter High School, but it was named after I was told family members way earlier in my life.  Don't know the real connection but they're related.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And sir, what is your date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2:  	Date of birth is September 17th, 1958, Chicago, Illinois.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is your title and occupation?
Speaker 2:  	My title is the corporate employee relations manager for AmeriGas Propane [AmeriGas Propane, Inc.].  That's the job that pays the bill.  And I hold two offices with the Montford Point Marine Association [Montford Point Marine Association, Inc.].  I'm the national public relations officer and the national legislative officer.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And I'll ask you about what those roles are later on when we get to that.
Speaker 2:  	Okay.
Speaker 1: So, and sir, what is today's date?
Speaker 2:  	Today is Tuesday the 26th of March, 2013.
Speaker 1: And where are we at the present time and--
Speaker 2:  	We're (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) you don't have to give your address.
Speaker 2:  	Okay, we're in my home in Limerick, Pennsylvania about thirty-five miles northwest of Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].
Speaker 1: Yeah, and just to point out, the street is called Red Tail Lane and I know that--
Speaker 2:  	It's such a coincidence isn't it, Red Tail Court, yes.
Speaker 1: Red Tail Court.  Was it named by Tuskegee Airmen?
Speaker 2:  	I don't think, I'm sure it was not.  Not in Limerick, Pennsylvania.  I think it's coincidence.  It may have been a red tail owl or red tail something, a red tail fox.  This is Fox Ridge (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Hawks.
Speaker 2:  	--so I'm sure it was not the Tu- but it was pretty cool when the movie ['Red Tails'] came out and I was getting a lot of correspondence and they, they may know of that Red Tail Court.
Story_ID: 650624
Speaker 1: Now before we go into depth, there are five kind of lightweight que- questions that we ask as sort of a practice.
Speaker 2:  	Okay.
Speaker 1: And they only require a short answer.  The first one is: do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2:  	Do I have a favorite food?  Oh yes I do.
Speaker 1: What is it?
Speaker 2:  	Fried chicken.
Speaker 1: Okay.  We can smell it--
Speaker 2:  	It's my grandmother's recipe.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2:  	Yeah.
Speaker 1: And do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2:  	It used to be magenta which is a shade of red, reddish brown.  But right now it's blue.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2:  	Right.
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2:  	Favorite time of the year, probably the wintertime.  I like the cold.  From Chicago [Illinois], cold reminds me of growing up in Chicago and it reminds me of the winter and family time too.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2:  	Don't go on enough of them.  I've been on very few vacations so really don't have a favorite.  I've been to St. Martin in the Bahamas recently so St. Martin was beautiful so St. Martin, wouldn't mind going back there.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And the last question is do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2:  	Somebody told me one time that he had a sign above his door.  He was a warrant officer in the [U.S.] Marine Corps that said, "If you can't find the time to do it right, when will you find time to do it again?"  So I try to do things right the first time.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2:  	Yeah.
Speaker 1: That's good.
Story_ID: 650625
Speaker 1: Now I'm going to ask you about your family history.
Speaker 2:  	Okay.
Speaker 1: I'm going to ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's [Joe Geeter, Jr.] side--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --and then we'll put them together.
Speaker 2:  	Okay.
Speaker 1: So can you give me your mother's full name and spell it for us please?
Speaker 2:  	My mother's name is Elma, E-L-M-A, middle initial K., last name Geeter, G-E-E-T-E-R.  Her maiden name was Hearn, H-E-A-R-N [Elma Geeter].
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2:  	She was born 19 February 1938 in Hazlehurst, Mississippi.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what can you tell us about your mother's side of the family?  How far back can you trace them and what were they--are there any stories about what they were doing?
Speaker 2:  	Well unfortunately, like in many African American families, we don't go too far back in our history because records weren't kept that could--in the late 1800s.  But I can trace it back to my mother's grandmother and her mother here in Chicago [Illinois].  I actually grew up at my grandmother's house on the South Side of Chicago which was her mother's house beforehand.  So it was a very old bungalow in Chicago.  So not too much about her great- her grandfather but her father, my grandfather [Ralph Piper] helped raise me.  He was very influential in my life.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what was your great-grandmother's name?
Speaker 2:  	Mother Dear is all I know.  I don't know her formal name but Mother Dear was her name.
Speaker 1: All right, and your grandmother?
Speaker 2:  	My grandmother was Anita Piper.
Speaker 1: Now was she any relationship to the tailor in Chicago, Scotty Piper [Louis "Scotty" Piper]?  He was a 47th Street tailor, well known on 47th Street.
Speaker 2:  	Scotty Piper, I don't know that name.  I know a Scotty but I don't know his last name.  But 47th Street, I know that street very well.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2:  	My grandfather walked the beat on 47th Street in the 1930s as a Chicago police officer.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2:  	Yeah.
Speaker 1: What this is your paternal grandfather or maternal--?
Speaker 2:  	Joseph Geeter, I, Sr. [Joe Geeter, Sr.].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well we'll get to him in a minute.  So--
Speaker 2:  	Okay, yeah.
Speaker 1: Now what about your grandfather on your mother's side?
Speaker 2:  	Ralph Nicholas Piper.
Speaker 1: Ralph Nicholas Piper, and so--in--so your grandfather I take it was born in Hazlehurst, too?
Speaker 2:  	No, my grandfather was born in St. Louis [Missouri].
Speaker 1: Okay.  So did your grandmother meet your grandmother, I mean your grandfather in Chicago?
Speaker 2:  	I think they met after World War II [WWII] in Chicago.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And then what did your grandfather do for a living?
Speaker 2:  	He spent most of his time as a courier, mail courier.  He worked for the U.S. post office [U.S. Post Office Department; U.S. Postal Service].  He was a truck driver for many years and when he retired he was a part owner of a bar in Chicago, the Huddle Inn [ph.].
Speaker 1: What's the name of it?
Speaker 2:  	The Huddle Inn.
Speaker 1: The Huddle Inn, oaky.
Speaker 2:  	H-U-D-D-L-E.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2:  	Right across the street from Morgan Park [Chicago, Illinois].
Story_ID: 650626
Speaker 1: So are there any stories about your ancestors on your mother's [Elma Geeter] side or, or the, your grandparents in--?
Speaker 2:  	Well my grandfather [Ralph Piper] wasn't really much of a story teller but I was always interested in his life because I knew he had served in the [U.S.] Army during World War II [WWII] so that was fascinating to me.  But back then those gentlemen just didn't talk about their experiences.  So after I came in the [U.S.] Marine Corps, I did some research to find out you know when he served, what his rank was, what units he was with so I found out a little bit about him.
Speaker 1: Okay, can you give us a general description of what he did?
Speaker 2:  	Well he was a truck driver.  He served with the 54th Ordnance Company.  He served on, landed on Normandy [France], part of D Plus 2, D Plus 3.  He was part of the unit called the Red Ball Express.  After the main assault troops hit the beach they were responsible for moving logistics inland.  So he was a truck driver with the Red Ball Express.  He served in Rhineland, he served in Patton's Third Army [U.S. Third Army; U.S. Army Central].  So he saw quite a lot of action in World War II.
Speaker 1: Okay.  He didn't talk about it?
Speaker 2:  	Not at all, not at all.  I saw the uniform hanging in his closet in the basement and I just knew he served but I don't remember one conversation with him about the service except for when I enlisted in the Marine Corps.  He told me that it was going to make a man out of me.  He was right.
Story_ID: 650627
Speaker 1: So your mother [Elma Geeter] was, was born in Hazlehurst, Mississippi (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2:  	(Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 1: So that means was, were, were both your grandparents there at that time or (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2:  	(Simultaneous) No, I think she was down there.  My grandmother originally, her family was from Mississippi although she was born in Chicago [Illinois], Anita Piper.  And I don't know what circumstances led her back to Mississippi for the birth of my mother.  I, but I just know my mother was born there.  But soon after, my mother migrated to Chicago.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2:  	So although she was born in Hazlehurst, she was raised in Chicago.
Speaker 1: So you had a lot of family in Hazlehurst?
Speaker 2:  	Yes, we did.  But they were distant relatives.  I didn't know too much about them.  I only visited Mississippi one time growing up, 1969.  I remember it vividly.  I was only eleven years old but I remember going down there.  It's a different world from Chicago.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So now did you--what part of Chicago did your mother grow up in?
Speaker 2:  	In Morgan Park and Englewood.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And did she graduate from Morgan Park High School [Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2:  	She graduated from Englewood High School [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Englewood High School.
Speaker 2:  	Class of '55 [1955].
Speaker 1: Okay, now I take it that she was a teacher right?
Speaker 2:  	No, my mother was a--she worked for the phone company.  She was actually an operator, telephone operator.  So she started off as an operator and retired as a district supervisor.
Speaker 1: Okay, telephone operator and supervisor.  Did she want to go to college when she graduated?
Speaker 2:  	I'm sure she did but the opportunity just wasn't there for her.  She married young.  She married my father [Joe Geeter, Jr.] at nineteen, so just never had the opportunity to go to college.  But she was very adamant about her children going.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now did she have any--what did she say about growing up in Chicago in those days?  What was it like?
Speaker 2:  	She talked a little bit about it was--(pause) it was I guess conservative.  She was lucky that she had a nice home, she had a nice mother and father [Ralph Piper] there.  She got an opportunity to go to school, she had friends, but again she fell in love with my father very, at a young age at eighteen or nineteen, so she didn't really have a young adulthood.  She went from a young lady to a mother in a hurry here.  She had all three of us.  I had one brother [David Geeter] and one sister [Felicia Geeter].  She had all three of us before she was legally allowed to vote.
Story_ID: 650628
Speaker 1: So let me go to go to your father's side of the family.
Speaker 2:  	Okay.
Speaker 1: Now this is Joseph Geeter the, Junior [Joe Geeter, Jr.], right?
Speaker 2:  	Yes, my father.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2:  	He was born 23 March and I don't know the year.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Was he like considerably--was he close to your mother's [Elma Geeter] age or?
Speaker 2:  	No, he was fourteen years older than my mother so I would imagine 1916 maybe.  I'm sorry, 19--
Speaker 1: Twenty-four [1924]?
Speaker 2:  	--twenty-four [1924].
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2:  	Sounds about right.
Speaker 1: Yeah, 1924, fourteen okay, yeah (unclear).  Yeah that's right, 1924.  And where was your father born?
Speaker 2:  	Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what can you tell us about your father's side?  How far back can you trace that side?
Speaker 2:  	Again, not too far back.  Just go back to his father really and his mother.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So your grandfather, Joseph Geeter [Joe Geeter, Sr.]--
Speaker 2:  	Senior.
Speaker 1: Geeter, right.  Okay, well it does say something when you have like three you know generations of--
Speaker 2:  	Right.
Speaker 1: --everybody know, has got a father in the home.
Speaker 2:  	Right.
Speaker 1: You know, so that's a--what did your grandfather do?
Speaker 2:  	My grandfather was a Chicago police officer.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2:  	As a matter of fact he may have been the first African American Chicago police officer.  But at the time they weren't accepting blacks so he passed for an Indian [Native American].  So they called him Indian Joe.
Speaker 1: So this is--now, okay.  Now he would have been on the force [Chicago Police Department]--
Speaker 2:  	Nineteen twenty-nine [1929] to 1959.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's thirty years.
Speaker 2:  	Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  He had like--and I've heard the tales of some of the early black police officers.
Speaker 2:  	Two-Gun Pete [Sylvester Washington].
Speaker 1: Two-Gun Pete.
Speaker 2:  	That was his partner.
Speaker 1: Oh okay.
Speaker 2:  	Sylvester Two-Gun Pete.
Speaker 1: Two-Gun Pete has got a reputation on the South Side [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 2:  	A hell of a reputation.
Speaker 1: That you know territory around 47th Street.
Speaker 2:  	Absolutely.
Speaker 1: South Park [South Parkway; Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Drive].
Speaker 2:  	Very good.
Speaker 1: Near the Regal Theater [Chicago, Illinois] and all that.
Speaker 2:  	Absolutely.
Speaker 1: Yeah, he was known as a very rough customer.
Speaker 2:  	He sure was.
Speaker 1: Yeah. And so your father was his partner?
Speaker 2:  	Yes, he was.
Speaker 1: I mean your grandfather (simultaneous).
Speaker 2:  	(Simultaneous) My grandfather.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Story_ID: 650629
Speaker 1: So that's something.  So they, they--do they ever find out or acknowledge that your father [sic. paternal grandfather] was African American or did they officially always keep him as an Indian [Native American] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2:  	(Simultaneous) Well as he tells the story right after, during World War II [WWII], a lot of people knew that he was not--well they knew he wasn't white but he never really held a banner up to say I'm African American.  But by the '40s [1940s] and the '50s [1950s] when Two-Gun Pete [Sylvester Washington] came up, they knew he was African American.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Are there any stories about your grandfather that he's shared or has been passed down through the family?
Speaker 2:  	Oh absolutely.  He was a tough cop in Chicago [Illinois]. He was part of what they called the flying squad with Two-Gun Pete.  Back then they didn't have patrol cars, they actually walked the beat so I would hear stories about how him and Two-Gun Pete would commandeer an ice cream truck and go in the alley and catch folks either shooting craps or selling marijuana and sneak up on them and arrest them.  And because they didn't have a patrol car, they would just send them down to the precinct and say you just go down there and you tell the desk sergeant that Two-Gun Pete or Indian Joe [Joe Geeter, Sr.] arrested you and we'll be down there later to fill out the paperwork.  And lo and behold if you wasn't there when he got there at the end of the day, so a couple of tough characters here.
Speaker 1: People would normally go.
Speaker 2:  	Oh, they always went.  Two-Gun Pete, I don't know the official number but I think Chicago has him as killing eleven people.  You talk to Two-Gun Pete, it was probably double that number.  He wasn't afraid to use those pistols he carried with him.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So what else about your--now so your grandfather, Joseph Geeter, he, did he get involved with any other enterprises?  I know a lot of times Chicago cops you know run other businesses and buy real estate and do all kinds of things.
Speaker 2:  	Right, well Two-Gun Pete ran a couple of saloons and bars but my grandfather moonlighted as a lifeguard.  He was quite the swimmer so he did a lot of lifeguard duty on--aboard beaches near Lake Michigan.  Matter of fact, that's how he met my grandmother [Grace Thompkins Barker] I've been told.
Speaker 1: Did he, was he a lifeguard on 63rd Street Beach [Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2:  	I don't know if it was 63rd.
Speaker 1: 47th Street?
Speaker 2:  	I think it was more like 47th.
Speaker 1: 47th Street, okay.  (Pause) Did you have any sense of what it took to qualify for the police department [Chicago Police Department] in those days?  Did he have to finish high school or go to college or anything?
Speaker 2:  	I really don't know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2:  	Don't know.  I don't know what his level of education was to be honest with you.
Speaker 1: We do know it helped not to be black--
Speaker 2:  	Yeah.
Speaker 1: --to get in the police department.
Speaker 2:  	Probably do but they were accepting blacks but I just didn't know that they knew he was black because at the time they needed--Chicago wanted to show black police officers on the South Side to police up after black citizens; so he was part of that.
Story_ID: 650630
Speaker 1: Now what about your father [Joe Geeter, Jr.]?  Now what did, what did he do for a living?
Speaker 2:  	For the most part he was a salesman.  My father was a jack of all trades.  He was a salesman, he was an inventor, he was a photographer, he was a master emcee.  He emceed a lot at the Regal [Regal Theater, Chicago, Illinois], at the High Chaparral and a lot of other clubs in Chicago [Illinois] at the time.  When the big bands and musician would come to town he would usually introduce them.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So salesman, an emcee, what else did you say?
Speaker 2:  	He was a photographer too.
Speaker 1: Photographer, okay.
Speaker 2:  	And he did a lot of freelance for Chicago Sun-Times and Ebony magazine.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did he have any stories about famous people he shot or situations he got in?
Speaker 2:  	Not situations but he shot almost everybody from Duke Ellington, Sammy Davis, Jr., Lena Horne.  If they came to Chicago, he was usually somewhere either taking pictures or introducing them.
Speaker 1: Okay, so he was well known within the--?
Speaker 2:  	He was.  He was very well known on the South Side [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now is there a story about how your parents met?
Speaker 2:  	I have no idea how they met.  I'm embarrassed to say I don't know how they met.  I know my grand- my father went to DuSable High School [Chicago, Illinois] and my mother [Elma Geeter] went to Englewood [Englewood High School, Chicago, Illinois] but of course different eras, they were fourteen years apart.  But I don't know how they first encountered each other.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But your dad went to DuSable High School.  Now what did he sell as a salesman?
Speaker 2:  	He sold beauty products, he sold dishes, he sold potato chips.  He sold an invention he did for a burglar alarm.  He sold a lot of stuff, anything he could get his hands on to sell.  He ended up working for Levitz Furniture [Levitz Furniture Corporation; Levitz Furniture, Inc.] for probably the longest tenure of his sales career and he sold furniture.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Was Levitz on the South Side now?
Speaker 2:  	Yes, he was.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2:  	Yeah, South Side and south suburbs.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now okay, so did your parents like--I suppose they met then in the--are you the oldest?
Speaker 2:  	No, my sister [Felicia Geeter] is one year older than me.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So I guess they met around '56 [1956] to '57 [1957]?
Speaker 2:  	Fifty-six [1956], '57 [1957] is correct, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 650631
Speaker 1: Now when you think about your parents' personalities, their dispositions, their habits, their hobbies, how they walk, talk, look--
Speaker 2:  	All right.
Speaker 1: --who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2:  	Probably both of them.  My parents separated at a--when I was very young but I was in contact with my father [Joe Geeter, Jr.] especially after I turned eighteen and came in the [U.S.] Marine Corps and I noticed a lot of his traits I had, his love of photography, he was quite an avid bowler.  Again, he was a great emcee and I try to be a good emcee.  He was a great salesman.  He could sell anything.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2:  	He could sell anything.  And I was a recruiter so I sold the Marine Corps for three years, so--
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2:  	But my mother [Elma Geeter] was more organized.  She was very, very organized so I still take after her when I pay my bills and write notes to myself and set up my files as you can see around the house here.  She was--everything had a place for my mother and everything, there was a place for everything.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's good training.
Speaker 2:  	Very good training.
Story_ID: 650632
Speaker 1: You have a sister, just, just one sister?
Speaker 2:  	One older sister, Felicia [Felicia Geeter].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2:  	Yeah.
Speaker 1: It's just the two of you?
Speaker 2:  	My older sister Felicia and younger brother David [David Geeter].
Speaker 1: Okay.  So how old you were you when your parents split?
Speaker 2:  	Very young.  I think I may have been four or five.
Speaker 1: So did you see very much of your--I guess you stayed with your mother [Elma Geeter] I suppose then?
Speaker 2:  	Stayed with my mother and her parents, my grandmother [Anita Piper] and grandfather [Ralph Piper].
Speaker 1: Okay.  So did you see very much of your father [Joe Geeter, Jr.]?
Speaker 2:  	Hardly any.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2:  	Hardly any.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But it's interesting.  So he's somebody who was in the public life a lot but you--
Speaker 2:  	Right.
Speaker 1: --didn't really see a lot of him at home?
Speaker 2:  	No I did not.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2:  	I did my best to track him down though.  I was kind of wondering who he was and where he was so there were times when I was eleven or twelve years old and I would venture out in Chicago [Illinois] to look for him.  I really did.
Speaker 1: Now did he have other children?
Speaker 2:  	No, not that I know of, no.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now, so, when you grew up it was basically your, you know your mother, your, your sister and your younger brother and your grand- grandmother (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2:  	(Simultaneous) My grandparents, yes.
Speaker 1: Your grand- both grandparents then?
Speaker 2:  	Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, on your mother's side?
Speaker 2:  	Yes.
Story_ID: 650633
Speaker 1: What neighborhood did you grow up in and--?
Speaker 2:  	Born and raised in Morgan Park [Chicago, Illinois].  I lived there almost my entire life from birth to eighteen, with the exception of one year I lived in the Roseland community [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Now you said the house had a history.  It was an old house and--
Speaker 2:  	Oh yes, old Chicago [Illinois] bungalow.  I don't know what year it was built.  I would imagine it was the early '20s [1920s], a good solid house.
Speaker 1: It was a brick bungalow?
Speaker 2:  	Oh yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And describe Morgan Park.  Who lived there and--
Speaker 2:  	Okay.
Speaker 1: --what was the lay of the land?
Speaker 2:  	Morgan Park is, it wasn't incorporated into the city 'til much later.  When I say later right before I was born I believe.  I don't know the exact year it was incorporated but it's on the far South Side of Chicago.  It was a--considered maybe middle class blacks at the time during the '40s [1940s] and the '50s [1950s] and when I was coming up in the '60s [1960s].  But like a lot of neighborhoods in Chicago towards the '60s [1960s], some of the gangs started coming in and it got a little tough.  But the neighbors knew each other, they looked out for each other.  If I did something wrong I could expect my neighbor up the street to chastise me before my mother [Elma Geeter] got home.  And if I told my mother she did it, I probably got another whooping.  So--
Speaker 1: Now I've been told there's a history of black people living out in Morgan Park and that area on the South Side I mean it goes way back.
Speaker 2:  	Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now you know, 'cause I think one time you know black people on the South Side lived along what they called the Black Belt and only could go beyond 63rd Street south.
Speaker 2:  	Right.
Speaker 1: But then there was this group of black people out in Morgan Park.
Speaker 2:  	Yes, correct.  And I think, and I forgot her name, I want to say, is it Lorraine Hansberry, 'Raisin in the Sun' ['A Raisin in the Sun']?  There was, it was set in Morgan Park [sic.].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2:  	A lot of people don't know that, but that was actually set in Morgan Park in Chicago.
Story_ID: 650634
Speaker 1: Can you describe for us the sights, the sounds, the smells of growing up?
Speaker 2:  	The sights was I guess the neat lawns.  Everybody, at least especially on my block really took care of their lawns and took care of their houses.  We learned very early on you didn't walk on the neighbor's grass, you walked on the sidewalk.  But the sights and sounds were mostly of children playing.  We always had activity on the block.  You could find the girls playing jump rope or hopscotch and the young men playing marbles and the like here.  So it was very, very active community, very active block I lived on [in Morgan Park, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2:  	Yeah.
Speaker 1: And you know and some of the major cities today that are like empty houses and (unclear) but that's not, wasn't the case when you were growing up?
Speaker 2:  	No.  Oh no, every house had a family in there and we knew every family on the block and sometimes two or three blocks over.  But particularly the block that you lived on I think I knew, we knew every neighbor on the block and we knew their kids.  We grew up with their kids.  My mother [Elma Geeter] grew up with the other kids that were on the block, my friends' parents, they grew up together.
Speaker 1: Okay, any other sights and sounds and smells?
Speaker 2:  	As far as sounds I remember hearing the whistle from the steel factory which was only maybe a mile away.  But if the wind was blowing just right you could hear that whistle.  And for a long time I didn't know what it was and I was told that was a shift changing at the steel factory which was on 119th Street and I lived on 113th Street.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what else?
Speaker 2:  	As far as from my young age it was not too much I remember about sights or sounds or smells was always the fresh flowers or the vegetables growing out back.  We had a, my [maternal] grandmother [Anita Piper] had a very nice garden with tomatoes and we had a pear tree in the back so it was always fresh, fresh food in the house.
Story_ID: 650635
Speaker 1: Was church a big part of growing up?
Speaker 2:  	Oh absolutely.  My mother [Elma Geeter] was a Baptist, like her mother [Anita Piper] before her.  My father [Joe Geeter, Jr.] was a Catholic so when they married my mother actually converted because my father wanted his children raised Catholic.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So when you grew up did you go to, what did you go to a Catholic School?
Speaker 2:  	Yes I did, Catholic grammar school.
Speaker 1: And what was the name of your school?
Speaker 2:  	Holy Name of Mary [Holy Name of Mary School, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Okay.  So this is elementary school right?
Speaker 2:  	Yes it is.
Speaker 1: And did you like school?
Speaker 2:  	Grammar school I enjoyed it, I did 'cause I knew most of my classmates since kindergarten because you know once you start off in grammar school in the Catholic school you kind of go through all the stages with that same group of little boys and little girls.  And I knew them from kindergarten all the way up 'til now.  I'm still in contact with many friends from grammar school.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So the school is the same place as the church I mean the same location?
Speaker 2:  	Yes, the school, the church the convent, the rectory it was all located within a two block radius in Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 1: And Holy Name of Mary is where?
Speaker 2:  	It's on 111th [sic. 112th Street] and Loomis [Street].
Speaker 1: 111th and Loomis, okay.  So, okay so were there--I suppose there are usually a lot of activities for youth around Catholic schools and that sort of thing.  Were there a lot of things--?
Speaker 2:  	There was a lot to do.  They had the Christian Youth Organization [sic. Catholic Youth Organization], they had a CYO.  They had the--my brother [David Geeter] and I were both altar boys, altar servers, so we were involved in the church, in the school that way.
Story_ID: 650636
Speaker 1: Did you play sports when you were growing up?
Speaker 2:  	Not organized sports.  My brother [David Geeter] and I both, my brother played basketball, he was a lot better than I was.  I bowled in high school [Morgan Park High School, Chicago, Illinois], played a little baseball but no, nothing really organized.  But there was always a game in a park which was only three blocks from our house so I spent a lot of time in a park.
Speaker 1: It was actually Morgan Park [Chicago, Illinois] itself here?
Speaker 2:  	No, the park was Ada Park.
Speaker 1: Oh Ada Park, okay.
Speaker 2:  	But it's located inside Morgan Park.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what were you interested in growing up?
Speaker 2:  	As far as sports, baseball.  I loved baseball.  My earliest memories is listening to baseball on the radio 'cause my babysitter always listened to the White Sox [Chicago White Sox].  And when the game was on we had to be quiet and listen as well so--
Speaker 1: Okay, who was--who were the White Sox heroes in those days?
Speaker 2:  	Well that was his team.  My team was the Cubs [Chicago Cubs].  The White Sox heroes in those days was probably Luis Aparicio and maybe Wilbur Wood, but I knew the Cubs quite well especially when [HistoryMaker] Ernie Banks was playing.
Speaker 1: Now how do you account for being a Cubs' fan living so far south?
Speaker 2:  	Well mainly 'cause the clubs had--the Cubs had more black players.  I wish I could put it another way but I was surprised at the number of black players they had, Ernie Banks, [HistoryMaker] Billy Williams, Ferguson Jenkins, those were my heroes growing up.
Speaker 1: It was significant that Ferguson Jenkins was a, he was a pitcher.  There weren't that many black pitchers in the Major Leagues [Major League Baseball].
Speaker 2:  	No there weren't, not back then but he was one of the best.  He was actually Canadian born but Fergie Jenkins won a whole lot of games.  I think it was twenty game winner, six years in a row; so he was an absolute hero of mine.
Story_ID: 650637
Speaker 1: So you were talking about the Cubs [Chicago Cubs] and you're really a baseball fan.
Speaker 2:  	Oh absolutely.
Speaker 1: And the Cubs in those days.  Now you were born in '58 [1958].
Speaker 2:  	Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So you were about eleven when the '69 [1969] Cubs (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2:  	(Simultaneous) Oh, that's painful.
Speaker 1: The painful, I mean they got so close, so close.  They had such a great team.
Speaker 2: They sure did.  They were eight games up in August.  The Mets [New York Mets], the Amazing Mets were the up and coming team when they played the game and I forgot who they was playing but a black cat got on the field and we already had our share of jinx with the Billy Goat and the World Series [1945 World Series].  And when that black cat came on the field we just knew it just wasn't going to happen and I was eleven years old but I remember that.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that (unclear)--
Speaker 2:  	I was so disappointed.
Speaker 1: --the team with [HistoryMaker] Ernie Banks and [HistoryMaker] Billy Williams.
Speaker 2:  	Yeah.  I don't think Fergie [Ferguson Jenkins] was there in '69 [1969], but I think Ron Santo may have been there and--
Speaker 1: Yeah, he was.
Speaker 2:  	--Kenny Holtzman was there and Bill Hands and oh, it was just a great squad and they never recovered from that.  And when they did, somebody named Scott Bartman [sic. Steve Bartman] got in the way of a baseball.  It's tough being a Cubs fan, it really is.
Speaker 1: That's true.  I was a Cubs fan there in Chicago [Illinois].  So--
Speaker 2:  	Well back then the players were closer to the fans.  The average player only made maybe six or seven times what the average man made.  That's far from the case now.  And most of them had jobs in the off season.  Ernie Banks owned a gas station four blocks from my house.  So on Saturdays when they were in town and they weren't playing, he would actually come to the gas station and check over the books and put up with us kids bothering the heck out of him all day long.  So--but he never turned us away.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I was going to ask you about that.  I, cause I heard he lived in Chatham [Chicago, Illinois] I guess--
Speaker 2:  	Think he lived in Chatham but he had a business in Morgan Park [Chicago, Illinois].  It was actually Maple Park [Chicago, Illinois] 'cause it was on the other side of 115th Street, 115th and I want to say Elizabeth [Street].  There was a gas station there that he operated and I guess he owned and operated it.  But we knew Saturdays that he would be there and we would show up just to get his autograph, just to talk to him, sometimes just to look at him.
Speaker 1: He's a man that's gone down in history in Chicago as Mr. Cub.
Speaker 2:  	Mr. Cub.
Speaker 1: No black in Chicago--
Speaker 2:  	Yeah.
Speaker 1: --in times when the black community wasn't treated as well as it should have been (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2:  	(Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 1: --and he was Mr. Cub.
Speaker 2:  	Let's play two.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2:  	Right, I always wanted to play two, just enjoyed baseball and loved double headers.  So--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 650638
Speaker 1: Now in school, now in Catholic school [Holy Name of Mary School, Chicago, Illinois], now how did you do in school?  Well, did you have a favorite subject or--?
Speaker 2:  	In Catholic school, in grammar school I think I did pretty well.  I enjoyed reading about history.  I was always a history buff so I enjoyed history.  I enjoyed biology too at the time because the instructor made biology interesting 'cause he was very animated.  It was a priest actually, Father Keaton [ph.] taught biology and he made me interested in biology for a while.  But I enjoyed all subjects in grammar school.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now did you, let's see.  Were you ever in the Boy Scouts [Boy Scouts of America]?
Speaker 2:  	Not the Boy Scouts.  I was in the wolverines which was a lower level of Boy Scouts.  I never made it up to Boy Scout.  My brother [David Geeter] and I were both wolverines for just a short period of time and I don't know why we didn't stay longer.  I don't remember being that interested in it.  I remember being teased about wearing a uniform and I think that had something to do with it.  Growing up in Chicago [Illinois] if they saw you in a little Boy Scout or a wolverine uniform, you got teased because some of the older guys were, were tough guys and they, they kind of picked on us.
Story_ID: 650639
Speaker 1: Now did you have any, were there any special mentors or father figures for you growing--?
Speaker 2:  	My grandfather.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2:  	My grandfather was my entire father figure community.  He did everything.  I grew up in his house.  He was a jack of all trades as far as I was concerned.  He would never, we would never see a plumber or electrician or carpenter in the house.  If something broke, he simply fixed it.  If he had a, wanted a barbecue pit, he built one.  When my brother [David Geeter] and I were feuding when we were coming into our teens, we shared a room together but my grandfather built me a room in the basement and made my brother and I help build the room.  So I was very proud of he helped, he allowed me to lay the floor to that room.  So he just, he did everything.  My grandfather was an incredible human being.
Speaker 1: Okay, now this is your mother's father?
Speaker 2:  	My mother's father, Ralph Piper.
Speaker 1: He was a mailman right?
Speaker 2:  	Yes he was.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2:  	Yes he was.
Speaker 1: So he gave you a little bit of time though he had another, he started this other business right, too?
Speaker 2:  	Well he always, I always remember my grandfather having a couple of jobs.  He was a mailman, he drove a dump truck.  I remember enjoyed riding in that dump truck that he had.  He was the part owner of a bar [Huddle Inn (ph.)] as I said earlier.  I thought he was a bartender.  It wasn't 'til years later that I knew that, I found out that he was part owner in that bar.  So he was actually protecting his interests when he was working.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And in Chicago [Illinois] even today I think there are a lot of--there's almost a lounge or a bar on every street.
Speaker 2:  	Yes it is, a neighborhood or pub or bar, yes there are.
Speaker 1: Right.  And so were most of his clientele from the area?
Speaker 2:  	Oh yes they were.  They were mostly Morgan Parkers, World War II [WWII] vets like himself.  I knew where the bar was.  I don't remember stepping foot in there but maybe once or twice my entire life 'cause I knew better.  My grandmother [Anita Piper] didn't want me anywhere near a bar, but it was actually right across the street from my high school [Morgan Park High School, Chicago, Illinois].  So I would literally walk past that bar after high school every day.
Story_ID: 650640
Speaker 1: Did you go to a junior high school or middle school?
Speaker 2:  	No, I went to Morgan Park [Morgan Park High School, Chicago, Illinois] for my sophomore, junior and senior years.  My freshman year I actually went to Mendel Catholic High School [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Okay. (Pause) Mendel, that's nearby isn't it?
Speaker 2:  	It's in the Pullman district, 111th [Street] and King Drive [Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Drive].
Speaker 1: Mendel Catholic, okay.  Was Mendel like primarily white, right?
Speaker 2:  	It was.  It was majority white when I went there and that's in the '70s [1970s].  It was all boys Catholic high school, ended up being coed and now I believe it's a private, prep college if it's still there.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you would have been there, you must have graduated in '66 [1966], I mean '76 [1976]?
Speaker 2:  	I graduated from high school in '76 [1976].  I went to Mendel '72 [1972], '73 [1973].
Speaker 1: Okay.  In '73 [1973] to '76 [1976], you were at--?
Speaker 2:  	In Morgan Park.
Speaker 1: Morgan Park, okay.  Now why did you change schools?
Speaker 2:  	I had a discipline problem.  I got in trouble.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2:  	I was a good Catholic school boy from first to seventh grade.  We moved like I said earlier for a year to Roseland [Chicago, Illinois].  My mother [Elma Geeter] fell in love with a man that wanted to build a house and take care of us so we moved with him to Roseland from '71 [1971] to '72 [1972], but unfortunately that year I could not go to Holy Name of Mary [Holy Name of Mary School, Chicago, Illinois] because we lived a little bit too far to go to that school so I had to enroll in a public school and that's where I learned how to get tough.  We got, my brother [David Geeter] and I got picked on a lot for being Catholic school boys so I had to learn how to fight.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So was there a gang that predominated that neighborhood?
Speaker 2:  	Well I don't know if there was really an organized gang.  There was a gang of boys that picked on my brother and I relentlessly our first year.  It got so bad that my brother had to transfer to another school for his eighth grade.  But I was in eighth grade so I just toughed it out that eighth grade year but it kind of made me a little tougher.  So by the time I got to Mendel, I was, I had a discipline issue, not academically but if somebody said the wrong thing to me, I usually got into a scuffle.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I needed some discipline.
Story_ID: 650641
Speaker 1: So Morgan Park [Morgan Park High School, Chicago, Illinois], well today has a- academic reputation of being a good school.
Speaker 2:  	Oh it's a very good school now.
Speaker 1: In those days what was the reputation?
Speaker 2:  	I think it was a good school then.  We had a large class.  I think my senior class was close to eight hundred.  It was probably evenly split between white and black at the time, may have been more whites than black at the time at Morgan Park.  But by the time I transferred there for my sophomore year I felt more comfortable there because I knew most of the kids there 'cause I grew up in Morgan Park [Chicago, Illinois].  Mendel [Mendel Catholic High School, Chicago, Illinois] had students from all over the city.  There were no geographical boundaries when it came to Catholic schools.  If you could afford it or get into it then you could attend a Catholic school.  But Morgan Park was geographically bound by the community of Morgan Park so I knew all these people.
Speaker 1: Now Mendel, is that the one across from Palmer Park [Chicago, Illinois] in--?
Speaker 2:  	Yes it is.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's got a campus like a college.
Speaker 2:  	Yes it does.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2:  	With a big old fountain in the middle that you walked around for discipline.  They called in carousel and I walked around that fountain more times than anybody else I believe here, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Yeah, now I just, it just dawned me what you were talking about Mendel--
Speaker 2:  	Yeah, part of Pullman district [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Right, historic Pullman.  So when you were a senior in high school, did you get, at, when you got to Morgan Park did you settle down a little bit?
Speaker 2:  	I was, think I was more comfortable.  I wasn't mad at the world at the time because again I was, there was familiar faces there.  The teachers, they were tougher I think, even tougher than the priests at Morgan Park [sic.].  But I think they cared for us.  They generally wanted us to success so I found a lot of peace from my teachers, particularly the history teacher, Joseph Gonski [ph.].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2:  	He was quite an inspiration to me.
Speaker 1: How do you spell his name?
Speaker 2:  	G-O-N-S-K-I.
Speaker 1: Okay, he was a history teacher?
Speaker 2:  	He was a history teacher, American history.
Speaker 1: Okay, American history.  Okay.
Speaker 2:  	Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.  So you liked history and any other--now what did he or how did he do, how did he make history (unclear)?
Speaker 2:  	Well he was a younger teacher.  A lot of teachers that I remember in high school were older.  When I say older, maybe forties or fifties but Joe Gonski was probably in his thirties so it was a closer connection really.  I remember he wasn't a family man.  I remember him being a bachelor.  I remember him being a bowler but I remember how much time he took with all of the kids to talk about history to get interested in history and not just history but real, current world events.  He was also the captain of the Model United Nations.  He got me interested in the Model UN in high school.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So did you become a delegate to the model--
Speaker 2:  	Yes, I did.
Speaker 1: --the Model UN?
Speaker 2:  	Sure did.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2:  	Yeah, we went up to I think it was George Washington College in Lake Geneva, Wisconsin [sic. George Williams College; George Williams College of Aurora University, Williams Bay, Wisconsin] for a mock United Nations, very interesting.
Speaker 1: I want to make a joke about a mock UN, but I--
Speaker 2:  	Yeah, it wasn't too far from that.
Speaker 1: I'm not going to do that.
Speaker 2:  	I got you.
Speaker 1: But this is, okay, so this is a really good experience.
Speaker 2:  	Morgan Park was a great experience.  I had again friends there, had good teachers, Mr. Gonski in history, Ms. Springer [ph.] was an African American history teacher.  She made African American history interesting and fun.  I was always interested to learn about where I came from, where my people came from; so Ms. Springer was very important too.
Story_ID: 650642
Speaker 1: You graduated the year before 'Roots' came out, right?
Speaker 2:  	Yes, 'Roots' came out in 1977, yep, and I graduated in '76 [1976].
Speaker 1: So I'll ask you about that in a minute, see if you, you know--
Speaker 2:  	Good story there.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  But okay, so how were your grades at Morgan Park [Morgan Park High School, Chicago, Illinois] at this point?
Speaker 2:  	Terrible.  And I'm smiling because they got better.  I just didn't take it seriously.  I was smart enough to pass every class, probably excel at every class but I was so busy with my friends and hanging out and then trying to be cool I guess in the '70s [1970s] in Chicago [Illinois].  And then at one point I realized I have to graduate.  You know I got to have a career.  I think that was around in my junior year when my grades started to get a lot better and in my senior year I took things very seriously because I knew this was my last year in high school and I had to straighten up and fly right.  And I knew I was coming to the [U.S.] military at that time but I still knew I had to graduate.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now you hadn't thought about going to college right after school?
Speaker 2:  	I thought about it but I knew my mother [Elma Geeter] couldn't afford it.  That just wasn't a goal for me.  My sister [Felicia Geeter] was a year ahead of me, extremely smart, never missed a day of school.  I don't think she ever got a B in school.  She was a straight A student and I knew she had to go to college.  And I knew my mother couldn't afford her and me in college.  My brother [David Geeter] was one year behind me.  He was an aspiring engineer, quite smart himself and I knew that he wanted to go to college too.  So I was kind of in the middle in a lot of ways so I sought the military.  My best friend had just enlisted in the [U.S.] Marine Corps a year before my senior year and I followed right behind him.
Speaker 1: Now did he graduate--was he ahead of you?
Speaker 2:  	He was a year ahead of me.  He graduated 1975 from Harlan.  He went to Harlan High School [John Marshall Harlan High School; Harlan Community Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Harlan, John Marshall Harlan.
Speaker 2:  	Yes, he did.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So he kept you informed about what was going on in the Marines and--?
Speaker 2:  	Not really because he just went to boot camp.  I thought he had seen the world when he came back in uniform but he had only went to San Diego [Marine Corps Recruit Depot San Diego, San Diego, California] for boot camp.  But when he came back in that Marine Corps uniform, my mind was pretty much made up that that's what I wanted to do as well.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2:  	So--
Speaker 1: Now did you, had you checked in with a recruiter by the time you were a senior?
Speaker 2:  	No I did not.  As a junior though, his recruiter was starting to talk to me and then when he came back from boot camp then he kind of took me to the recruiting office.  At the time I didn't know it but he got five days extra leave because I enlisted.  I signed up when he was home on boot camp leave.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2:  	Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 650643
Speaker 1: Now I'm trying to think '76 [1976], this is the year that--okay, well you're in the [U.S.] Marine Corps when you fi- okay, let's--okay, so when you graduated from high school [Morgan Park High School, Chicago, Illinois], were there any special, did you have, you get any special honors or anything or any, any mention (unclear) (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2:  	(Simultaneous) I was a bowler in high school.  I took up bowling because my best friend, the same guy Tony [ph.] was a bowler.  So he was as year older than me and I really looked up to Tony because I didn't have a big brother and I was a big brother to my younger brother [David Geeter] but I didn't have anybody really to look up to.  So when I met Tony, although he was a year older than me, he really inspired me to do a lot of things and bowling was one of them so I bowled recreation league and then when I got to high school, the chess coach asked me to bowl.  I was on the chess team originally but they had to practice and I didn't like practicing.  I liked playing chess but I just didn't want to sit for three hours and practice playing chess.  So I used to go to the lunch room and beat up on the chess team and play them and take their lunch money from them.  Then Mr. Lakanata [ph.], who also was the bowling team captain, once he found out I wasn't serious about chess or being on his chess team, he asked me about bowling and I found out they didn't have to practice.  So I joined the bowling team.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now did you have to work in high school?
Speaker 2:  	No, didn't have any jobs.  I had one small job working in the bowling alley, but that was just cleaning up and getting paid pretty much under the table.
Story_ID: 650644
Speaker 1: When you graduate [from Morgan Park High School, Chicago, Illinois] you're, you're really set that you're going to, you know, summer--this is like May or June of '76 [1976]?
Speaker 2:  	Well I, I signed up for the [U.S.] Marine Corps in January of 1976 in the delayed entry program.  I was slated to graduate and to go to the Marine Corps in June.  However, when my senior counselor called me into her office she informed me that I didn't have enough credits to graduate because when I transferred from Mendel [Mendel Catholic High School, Chicago, Illinois], a lot of the credits that I earned in the Catholic high school in the freshman year weren't accepted in Chicago Public Schools and I didn't find that out 'til very late.  So I was told I had to go to summer school if I had to graduate but I knew I was going in the Marine Corps so I told the recruiter that you know it really didn't matter that I didn't graduate 'cause I was coming to the Marine Corps.  And at the time I think, and I may have the numbers wrong but less than half of enlistees had a high school diploma so I didn't think I needed one for the Marine Corps.  Well my recruiter was pretty adamant.  He says if you don't graduate you're not coming to the Marine Corps, so I had to go to summer school to finish up that last credit and a half.  So I didn't finish high school 'til August technically.
Speaker 1: Okay, so it's August of '76 [1976]?
Speaker 2:  	Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So were you, did you go immediately into the Marine Corps?
Speaker 2:  	Yes.  I believe I graduated the third or fourth week in August like the 23rd, 24th and I went into the Marine Corps September 20th.  So I wanted to make sure I was eighteen before I went into the Marine Corps.  So I turned eighteen on Friday, September 17th, 1976; and that Monday I was in boot camp.
Story_ID: 650645
Speaker 1: Where did you go to boot camp?
Speaker 2:  	Marine Corps Recruit Depot, San Diego, California [Marine Corps Recruit Depot San Diego, San Diego, California].
Speaker 1: All right, and so what was boot camp like?  Were you surprised or did you expect, did you have an idea what the Marines was going to be like?
Speaker 2:  	I think I had a good idea cause I was a very active poolee and a poolee is the name they give you when you sign up and you're in the delayed entry program and you attend weekly or monthly meetings and your recruiter is supposed to prepare you for boot camp.  Well between my recruiter, my best friend Tony [ph.] and just growing up in the South Side of Chicago [Illinois], I think I was ready for boot camp.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2:  	So I didn't surprise me.  Even though I was quite small, I was only a hundred and, less than a hundred and twenty pounds actually when I came in so I was actually underweight.  But I thought, I fashioned myself as a tough guy so I figured I could take anything they threw at me.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now the popular culture and notion of what a Marine was in those days was Gomer Pyle.
Speaker 2:  	(Laughter) I watched a lot of 'Gomer Pyle' ['Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C.'], yeah I did.  But I knew the difference.  I knew that was entertainment.  That was television.  That wasn't a [U.S.] Marine Corps because I had friends in the neighborhood [Morgan Park, Chicago, Illinois] that was in the Marine Corps and the [U.S.] Army.  Vietnam [Vietnam War] was going on then and I remember a lot of the parties when the young men in the neighborhood would receive orders from Vietnam and they would always have a big celebration before they would go overseas.  And although I was too young to go to the parties I just remember being on the block with people having these parties.  And then years later I thought about it and I remember all the parties for the young men going over there but I don't remember any celebrations when they came back and I thought that was pretty peculiar, if they came back.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Did you know any, of any that didn't come back?
Speaker 2:  	Not that I know of personally, no.  I knew a lot that went over there.  Maybe, not a lot but a handful that went over there and I just didn't track them coming back 'cause by the time they came back I was a junior or a senior in high school [Morgan Park High School, Chicago, Illinois] myself and really wasn't interested at the time.
Speaker 1: Now what about the Vietnam vets, did you encounter any of the veterans in the community?
Speaker 2:  	A few of them, yes a few of them.  But I didn't, again because of their age difference they didn't really talk to you know young men like me.  They talked amongst themselves.  So I knew when they gathered in the park.  I saw them gather in the park and talking.  I saw the remnants of the uniforms they wore, but they didn't really engage me in conversation.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2:  	Nor did I expect them to.
Story_ID: 650646
Speaker 1: Before you got out of high school [Morgan Park High School] and left Chicago [Illinois], did, did you, were you able to talk to your father [Joe Geeter, Jr.] a couple of times or--?
Speaker 2:  	Not really.  I tried tracking him down more than a few times because I was just interested, I had this guy's name, I knew he was in Chicago, I knew he was a poplar person in Chicago.  They, you know people knew who he was and I just found it kind of strange that he didn't want to be in our lives here.  So I was adventurous.  I would take buses and trains and walk and play detective and try to track him down here.  Came close a couple of times.
Speaker 1: Okay, but you just couldn't get near him?
Speaker 2:  	No.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You'd leave messages for him and that sort of thing?
Speaker 2:  	Messages and then he knew I was around.  I found out where he was working on 63rd Street and, 63rd and Halsted [Street] at the time.  I forgot the name of the furniture store but he was working there and I really think that he was in the store when I came in the store.  I think they kind of shielded him, or else he hid from me, I don't know.  But I ended up getting chased out of there.  I got threatened and chased out of the store.  So--
Story_ID: 650647
Speaker 1: So the [U.S.] Marine Corps, now you're at, you're in San Diego [Marine Corps Recruit Depot San Diego, San Diego, California].
Speaker 2:  	Yeah.
Speaker 1: And well tell us about boot camp, what is boot camp like?
Speaker 2:  	Well it was pretty much what I expected.  Again, because of my friend Tony [ph.], I expected it to be tough.  I expected the yelling, I expected the screaming.  I expected to get hit.  So it wasn't a surprise to me but I knew that I had no choice.  I had to make it.  If I didn't make it through there I had to go to back to Chicago [Illinois].  And by that time my sister [Felicia Geeter] was in college.  She was a freshman at Bradley University [Peoria, Illinois].  My mother [Elma Geeter] had received a promotion and she actually moved from Chicago to New Jersey and she took my brother [David Geeter] with her and so the only people left in Chicago was my grandmother [Anita Piper] and my grandfather [Ralph Piper] and my grandmother was pretty adamant that I wasn't coming back home.  So she says you know you're eighteen years old, you know again I had it pretty tough going on.  I had some discipline issues.  I was rebelling, probably because my father [Joe Geeter, Jr.] wasn't in my life as I look back at it now so I was a tough kid to handle.  But my grandmother did her best to handle me.
Speaker 1: Did you have any serious issues where you got arrested or anything before you went?
Speaker 2:  	No, not serious issues with the law or anything like that.  I was always or at least I thought I was one step ahead of that.  But I got into some scuffles and I rebelled and I cut class and I you know didn't pay attention to class.  My grandmother would always find me you know when I'd cut class I had a couple of hideouts that I would go to.  And sure enough before the day was over with, my grandmother was beating on the door saying she knew I was in there and to get out and go to school.  So my grandmother was very tough on me, extremely tough.
Speaker 1: She sounds like a very dedicated grandma.
Speaker 2:  	She was.  She was an angel then but she knew that I needed some extra love, extra attention, extra discipline and she gave it all to me.
Speaker 1: Now were you thinking in the back of your mind or even in the front of your mind that I needed to be in the Marine Corps?
Speaker 2:  	Oh absolutely.  I thought the Marine Corps wasn't going to put up with me and my crap.  They was going to put me in my place and they did in a hurry you know where I was--and I was never disrespectful I don't think to teachers or people in authority.  But it was just my friends and sometimes maybe my grandmother, not too much because she would really put me in my place in a hurry. So I mostly kind of hid from her, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now you often hear people say you know about the Marines more than any other branch of the service, "Join the Marines.  They'll make a man out of you."
Speaker 2:  	Oh yes, that's what my grandmother told me.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2:  	And my grandmother and they were exactly right.
Speaker 1: So what were your expectations in terms of that?  What did it mean discipline or toughness or what?
Speaker 2:  	I think it meant all of that, discipline first to know when to shut up.  You know you don't always have to express your opinion.  Sometimes you got to listen, to obey, to understand that some folks know more than you do and they know what's best for you even if you don't know what's best for you.  So I knew the Marine Corps wasn't going to put up with me and my shenanigans.  You know I had to do it when they said do it and how they said do it, period.  And so I kind of, I thrived on that, I loved that.  You know I loved my platoon, I loved the friends in my platoon; and we got along pretty good.
Story_ID: 650648
Speaker 1: Is this like when you're in the Marines, did you like the feeling of being part of a team or?
Speaker 2:  	It was.  It was part of belonging.  I was a recruiter so I know those intangibles that the [U.S.] Marine Corps sells and I bought into it and I wanted to be a part of that team.  So despite--some folks still didn't want us there and when I say us, I mean African Americans.  It was pretty tough in boot camp when they put the white platoon leaders, the squad leaders, the guide [guidon bearer], they were all white and they were tough on us.  They were tough on me.
Speaker 1: Did they give you racial insults and--?
Speaker 2:  	Oh absolutely, every day.  Every day but that was--I can give as good as I got though, so yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What was the toughest part of boot camp [at Marine Corps Recruit Depot San Diego, San Diego, California]?
Speaker 2:  	Not graduating with my platoon?
Speaker 1: Okay, well what happened?
Speaker 2:  	Got into a fight a couple of days from graduation.  That same old guy that was just throwing these epithets at me and talking about me, I got an opportunity to get him in a corner and I took advantage of it.  Yeah, that was tough.  But I wasn't going to let him go back to Texas talking about how he bossed around African Americans.  So I made sure I gave him a little something to remember me by.  But I got caught.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2:  	Yeah, so that was tough.
Speaker 1: So did you have a reasonable chance of not being caught?
Speaker 2:  	I didn't think I was going to get caught.  We were about a week from graduation when we're thinking we're going to be Marines, we were very close to being Marines and he had said something to me and my bunk mate and I think it was, had something to do with my buckle, my brass buckle.  He did something to it and I got a chance to get him what we called the hot locker at the time where we stored detergent and things of that nature.  And the drill sergeant really trusted us then because we had gone through seventy-two, seventy-three days of boot camp.  It was only seventy-eight days in boot camp, we was almost at graduation.  So they weren't in the squad at the time but this guy came into the hot locker when I was in there and I just took advantage of him and tried to knock him out.  Yeah, but then that wasn't the right thing to do then either here 'cause we got caught and when we went in front of the captain for what we, what I now know was office hours.  And the captain just had one question, "Who threw the first punch?"  And of course it was me.  So I had to do seven days in what they call correctional--correctional custody there, so seven days in the brig.
Speaker 1: And when you got out of the brig I mean you had, did you have to do boot camp all over again?
Speaker 2:  	Interesting story, that's probably the first time I'm really telling this publicly but when I got out of the boot camp, I went in front of an administrative officer.  I think it was a major at the time and I completed three of the four final steps for boot camp.  So he told me that, said, "You have a couple of choices here."  He said, "I could send you back to the platoon that's going to graduate next week and you can finish your final inspection," which was the fourth of the four things you had to do to graduate.  He said, "So the Marine Corps is really not the thing for you there young man because you really lost your discipline and your bearing and maybe you shouldn't be a Marine."  So he said, "I could administratively discharge you right here, right now and you go back to Chicago [Illinois]."  And the third choice I thought was very interesting.  He says, "I can administratively graduate you from boot camp because you've completed most of the necessary tasks to graduate and I can have you on an airplane in a couple of hours back to Chicago."  Guess what I took?  I got on the airplane back to Chicago and graduated administratively.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2:  	So when I went to recruiter school in 1987, part of recruiter school is to attend a graduation because these are the kids you're going to put in the Marine Corps to graduate.  And I remember looking over to the guy next to me, I says, "You know this is my first time really seeing a graduation."  And he says, "Joe [HistoryMaker Joe Geeter, III], you graduated from boot camp," and when I told him, "No I didn't," he was absolutely flabbergasted.  He said, "You what?  You never graduated from boot camp?"  And I never went to the ceremony.  And so it was pretty weird.  I never met anybody that didn't graduate from boot camp, but I didn't graduate.
Speaker 1: So he gave you an administrative graduation--
Speaker 2:  	From boot camp.
Speaker 1: --and then you flew back to Chicago for R and R [rest and relaxation] (unclear)?
Speaker 2:  	Yeah, I had ten days off.
Speaker 1: Ten days off.
Speaker 2:  	Actually a little bit more than ten days because I was scheduled to graduate December 22nd I believe and I think I went to correctional custody on December 17th or something like that.  So it was right before Christmas.  So they extended my time instead of the normal ten days I think I got like twelve or thirteen days, so I didn't have to report back to my next duty station 'til January 3rd; so I had a couple of weeks back home after boot camp.
Story_ID: 650649
Speaker 1: When you look back at this scenario, it doesn't sound so bad after, I mean you got a chance to punch this guy and you graduated (laughter).
Speaker 2:  	(Laughter) Yeah, I did.
Speaker 1: And you know, I don't know, and you got more time off.
Speaker 2:  	Yeah.
Speaker 1: I don't know, that's--
Speaker 2:  	Yeah I did.
Speaker 1: But you still regret that--?
Speaker 2:  	I regret it because I shouldn't have lost my discipline.  Boot camp and U.S. Marine Corps is all about discipline and I had made it through all the training, made it through everything.  Everything they told me to do I did and all the indignities, far less than what people before me went through but I had to go through it too.  You know where you had to pick up your own spit and white it on you and hear the N word constantly, it was--you know but I made it through all that and I only had a couple of days to go but I just couldn't let this guy from Texas just boss me around one more day.
Speaker 1: Now was it a--did they insult people from other parts of the country and other ethnic groups the same way?
Speaker 2:  	Well, mostly it was the Chicago [Illinois] folks because again it was about twenty of us as I said earlier in the platoon from Chicago.  Majority of us were African American and you joined people in a platoon of eighty people from all over the country with all kind of beliefs and their own socialization.  And this guy from Texas just thought he was above anybody of color and that he could order you around, that, you know, you had to do what he told you to do.  And when he was put in a position of authority as a squad leader, it really went to his head.  But we obeyed him because we wanted to be Marines.  But at some point I just couldn't take it anymore.  I just wanted to make sure that he understood that he wasn't above me.
Story_ID: 650650
Speaker 1: Okay.  You had a story I think you told off camera about the death of Mayor Daley [Richard J. Daley] and how you find out--found out about it in boot camp [at Marine Corps Recruit Depot San Diego, San Diego, California].  Can you tell that story?
Speaker 2:  	Oh yeah.  Now I forget exactly what time it was but I remember lights were out and the drill instructor, I think his name was Staff Sergeant Hart [ph.] just came in the squad bay, turned on the lights and asked how many of us was from Chicago [Illinois] and we told him how many of us was from Chicago.  And he said, "Your mayor just died.  Go back to sleep."  And that's just how I found out.
Speaker 1: You're (unclear).
Speaker 2:  	Yeah, he did.  He said, yes he did.  And it was tough then.  I mean, and it had to be tough.  And looking back at some of the things that we went through, that I went through, it just wouldn't be acceptable nowadays.  I remember they changed the voting age from twenty-one to eighteen so when I turned eighteen, I really wanted to vote and 1976 was an election year.  I went to boot camp September 20th and the election of course is, was in November of 1976.  And I remember asking the drill instructor, "How do I vote?" And I remember what he told me.  He said I was a maggot and maggots was the lowest thing on life and maggots don't vote and get the hell out of his face.  So that would never happen nowadays.  You, 'cause you're allowed to have an absentee ballot.  But I was actually denied the right to vote and that, that's, it didn't settle into me 'til years later.  A lot of things that happened to me once I looked back at them in retrospect, I see how impactful they were or how wrong they were.  And that was wrong.  I should have been allowed to vote.  But I made it a point that I'll vote in every election since then.  So--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2:  	--so maybe he taught me a lesson that voting was more precious than maybe I thought it was at the time.  I wanted to vote because I wanted to vote but I think he may have thought I wanted to vote to get out of whatever the platoon was doing that day.  But I really wanted to vote.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you finished boot camp, was it around thanksgiving or so?
Speaker 2:  	No it was December, December 1976.
Speaker 1: December 1976.  Did you get a chance to spend Christmas in Chicago?
Speaker 2:  	Oh yes I did.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2:  	Christmas in Chicago and New Year's Eve in New Jersey, which my mother [Elma Geeter] had moved to that previous August.
Story_ID: 650651
Speaker 1: Now what was your first assignment?
Speaker 2:  	My first assignment after boot camp was the Marine Corps communications school at Twentynine Palms, California [Marine Corps Communication-Electronics School].  My test scores were pretty good, especially in electronics and I was slated to be a radio repair person.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2:  	And if you're looking at my bio, you're not going to see that in the bio.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) I may have to write it in.  'Cause that's, you know--
Speaker 2:  	Yeah.  Well--
Speaker 1: --nineteen seventy-six [1976], all right.
Speaker 2:  	Again, those were some pretty tumultuous times my first couple of years in the [U.S.] Marine Corps.  I was still trying to find myself and I, we were still dealing with some racism in 1976 and I was in the school that was mostly all white, electronics school and quite candidly they didn't want me there.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So what happened?  What was the story?
Speaker 2:  	I caught a cold.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2:  	I caught a cold.  I went through two schools.  I went through a basic electronics course which was a grooming course, ten weeks long.  We learned basic electronic theory and then you go through FDLC, fundamental digital logic course where you understood binary numbers and logic.  I graduated from both of those courses and each time you graduated it was less people that looked like me in the class.  I think from my BEC class [basic electronics course], it may have been four blacks in there.  From my FDLC class, it may have been two or three blacks.  But then when I got to ground radio course, I believe I was the only black in the class and I caught a cold and I was coughing in class and the instructor said I was disruptive.  And I was sick and I--the next day I was coughing again and he said I was disruptive again and he threw me out of class so he dropped me from the school because I had a cold.  So I had go to in front of an administrative review board and I remember distinctly standing in front of this board with these senior enlisted Marines there asking me questions because the Marine Corps had invested a lot of money at--by this time, the school.  They weren't ready just to throw people out because they weren't getting it.  They had coaches to help you and they really wanted you to succeed, at least I thought they did.  So I was asked a series of questions during this review board.  I was pointing to a chalkboard.  I had to draw a power source, I had to draw a resister, a capacitor.  I had to do all kind of things and I think I did everything they asked me to.  And I remember one of the evaluators asking me, you know, "So why did you drop out of school?"  And I remember telling him, "I didn't drop out.  I was thrown out because I was coughing 'cause I had a cold."  But the instructor told him I was making jokes, I was being destructive.  He just wrote a whole lot of things in the report that I was not doing in order to get me out of school.  He just could not see an African American man become a 2841; that was the designation, a radio repair person.  So at the board when I found out that I was pretty bitter about it, didn't want to go back to the school because I knew I had to face him or somebody like him.  So I was given a choice and they were trying to guide me to going into the infantry at the time and I knew I didn't want to do that.  But I had one African American on that evaluation team that told me about a field called logistics.  He says, "We're looking for logisticians in the Marine Corps and there is a school right now at Camp Pendleton at Del Mar [Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton, San Diego County, California]," which was right there in Southern California that was accepting Marines for logistics school, so, so I went.
Story_ID: 650652
Speaker 1: So what was logistics school?  Now what did you have to learn now?
Speaker 2:  	It was great.  I had to learn, I was told that logistics was getting stuff from point A to point B and all the things that it takes to get equipment, men, women, supplies and to move them to the infantry--to support the infantry and I liked it.  I excelled in it.  I studied hard.  I was to learn how to type 'cause a lot of reports had to be typed.  You weren't a typist but you had to learn how to type reports.  You had to learn supply theories and I really excelled in that and I graduated top of the class.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now this is 1977, right?
Speaker 2:  	This was, I graduated from logistics school in 1977.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now this made you, this trained you to handle supply issues and moving supplies around (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2:  	(Simultaneous) Exactly.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2:  	And loading various types of ships, aircrafts, over the road trucks, the whole science of logistics.  I mean they didn't teach us all that in school, we just learned the fundamentals and then you learned when you went to advanced schools as your career progressed if you decided to stay in the [U.S.] Marine Corps.
Speaker 1: Now what was your rank at this point?
Speaker 2:  	I was a PFC.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2:  	Private first class.
Story_ID: 650653
Speaker 1: Now you had a story about 'Roots.'  We mentioned 'Roots' was, came out in '77 [1977].
Speaker 2:  	Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: And you have a love of history.  So what, what's the 'Roots' story?
Speaker 2:  	Well I was excited to hear that this was coming on TV because at the time there was very few black shows on TV that had black characters.  I remember 'Julia,' I remember 'Good Times,' I remember a few others shows but this was going to be a serious show talking about African Americans and their 'Roots,' from slavery up until you know wherever it ended.  I forgot where it ended.  But it was going to be a good show, it was going to come on over a series of nights and I really wanted to watch it.  We had one TV in the barracks and you can imagine fighting over who's going to watch what.  It was whites, blacks, Hispanics and you had to come to a consensus on what you was going to watch on the TV.  But most people and most Americans I think was interested in 'Roots.'  But at that time I was pulling guard duty.  You pull guard duty I think every other day, sometimes back to back days.  So I would watch a half an hour of one program and then the call would come out to go walk a post.  So I didn't get a chance to really enjoy 'Roots' at all from beginning to end until just recently when I bought the thirty-fifth anniversary set of 'Roots.'  And I finally got a chance to watch it and 'Roots' has a special place for me because a couple of characters in that, in the series I actually got a chance to meet and work with later on: Lou Gossett [HistoryMaker Louis Cameron Gossett, Jr.] actually was the voice of the documentary film we did on Montford Point Marines ['Marines of Montford Point: Fighting for Freedom'], and he was in 'Roots.'  And then most recently John Amos, who also was in 'Roots.'  John and I have become real good friends as a matter of fact.  He has an interest in African Americans in the [U.S.] military and if you're interested in that, I'm interested in you.  So John Amos and I have got the chance to know each other real well over the last few years.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2:  	Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Lou Gossett we've interviewed and he's an interesting man too.
Speaker 2:  	Oh he's incredible.  He received his Academy Award [Oscar] for playing a Marine drill instructor [Emil Foley].  And when we got the funding to do our first documentary film, he was at the top of the list to be our voice of the movie and he volunteered almost instantly.  So he's become I guess a friend as well.  I don't talk to him as often as I do John Amos, but I know I could pick up the phone and give him a call if I need something.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2:  	So--
Speaker 1: And the movie, 'An Officer and a Gentleman,' that came out what, '79 [1979], '80 [1980]?
Speaker 2:  	I want to say '83 [sic. 1982]. I may be wrong.
Speaker 1: Oh (unclear).
Speaker 2:  	But I think it was '83 [1983].
Speaker 1: I knew it was in that era.
Speaker 2:  	Yeah it's about thirty years ago.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.
Speaker 2:  	Didn't seem that long.
Speaker 1: All right.  Just, while we're on it, what did that--I've heard that movie mentioned about three times in interviews with black Marines [U.S. Marine Corps] and I hadn't--it's just now hitting me in the head that this was a big deal for (unclear)?
Speaker 2:  	The documentary film?
Speaker 1: No, the--I mean not that the documentary film is not--
Speaker 2:  	Oh.
Speaker 1: --but Lou Gossett playing a drill instructor.
Speaker 2:  	Oh, he, and he immersed himself into character.  As a matter of fact, I want to say Bill Dozier [ph.] was a legendary drill instructor, big guy, drill instructor and Bill trained Lou Gossett for the role.  He actually went through his own boot camp to learn how to walk, talk like a Marine, wear the uniform correctly, the mannerisms and Lou Gossett really immersed himself in that role.  And as a matter of fact, the national drill instructor association [United States Marine Corps Drill Instructors Association] named Lou Gossett an honorary drill instructor.  So I shared that with him because I too have that honor as being an honorary drill instructor.  So--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2:  	Yeah.
Speaker 1: I know in the past, the D.I. was played by Jack Webb in a movie called 'The D.I.,' back when and then--
Speaker 2:  	Oh yeah.  Yes, it was.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2:  	If you look at 'The D.I.,' and you look at 'Officer and a Gentleman' and you look at 'Full Metal Jacket,' you'll see the same character three times, just a little bit variation different.  But if you watch their mannerisms, watch how they talk and walk, yeah those are triplets.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Now this is, it raises another point too that the military, some of the roles are roles.  Whoever was the original drill instructor that set this standard--
Speaker 2:  	Right.
Speaker 1: --you know everybody since has kind of copied that standard.
Speaker 2:  	Absolutely.
Speaker 1: You know would you say that's--?
Speaker 2:  	I would agree.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  So is there any difference, I mean there's some difference in drill instructors down the line but pretty much people play the same--
Speaker 2:  	They do.  They have, the drill instructors is usually two, three or four to a platoon and they all have a role to play.  You have your senior drill instructor, you have your acting jack who's usually the tough guy, the senior drill instructor is like the father figure that you can come to when the other drill instructors are beating up on you and you have one that's usually an expert in drill, that's actually a drill instructor. So between the three or four of them, they really form a team and their team goal is to make a basic Marine out of you; and they do a good job of doing that.  They still do.
Story_ID: 650654
Speaker 1: You finish logistics school, now where would you--where were you stationed after logistics school?
Speaker 2:  	Well because I finished at the top of my class in logistics school I had a choice of duty stations.  Most Marine schools still allow that if you're an honor grad you get to pick at least geographically where you want to go, East Coast, West Coast or overseas.  I was still liking Southern California so I picked the 1st Marine Division which was only located about eight miles from where I was going to school aboard Camp Pendleton [Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton, San Diego County, California].  So I got to go what they call main side at the time to the 1st Marine Division headquarters.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So this is 1977, this is like three years after the U.S. got out of Vietnam (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2:  	(Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: And did you, well did people talk about the differences in the--or were there any differences in the [U.S.] Marine Corps?
Speaker 2:  	Oh absolutely.  Almost everybody I knew at the time were Vietnam vets as you mentioned.  Saigon [Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam] fell in April of 1975, combat operations stopped in March of 1973.  So even the most junior people, I had--we had corporals and sergeants with Vietnam experience.  So everybody, mostly everybody had Vietnam experience.  So that was important to learn from those folks and we learned a lot 'cause we never knew when the next conflict was coming so they really prepared you for the next war at the time.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now you, by--so by 1978, you were a lance corporal, right?
Speaker 2:  	Nineteen seventy-eight [1978], I was--I made lance corporal, 1977.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And this is as a logistics--?
Speaker 2:  	Yes, I made lance corporal as a logistical person.
Speaker 1: Okay, and you stayed at Camp Pendleton how long?
Speaker 2:  	Not that long.  I think I graduated from logistics school I want to say maybe October '77 [1977], and by February 1978, I was in Okinawa, Japan [Okinawa Island, Japan].
Speaker 1: Okay.  So tell us about Okinawa.
Speaker 2:  	Okinawa, I wanted to go to Okinawa, number one.  I could not wait to get to Okinawa because most Marines had served overseas either in Vietnam or Philippines or somewhere overseas.  And for the order of Marines, if you hadn't had a tour overseas, then they kind of looked down at you because you didn't have the experience that they had and I wanted to get that experience.  So I was in a hurry to get over there.  And back then you didn't orders by your name.  It was a thing called QSN, quota serial number where headquarters would come down with a number to say we need three large extensions to go to Okinawa.  And the gunnery sergeant in a platoon had a lot of authority, a lot of power.  They could walk up to you in a platoon and say, "You, you, you, you're going to Okinawa," and that's what happened to me.  I was, like Ellis Cunningham says, I was one of the yous, so I got assigned to the 3rd Marine Division in Okinawa in February of 1978 and I could not wait to get over there.
Speaker 1: And what was Okinawa like?
Speaker 2:  	Tropical islands, a small island.  It's about four hundred miles south of the main islands of Japan.  It was a staging island during the Vietnam War.  Most people, most Marines that went to Vietnam went through Okinawa to get to Vietnam.  Of course it was the site of a famous World War II [WWII] battle, and it was a beautiful island back then.  When I first got there it was still under American control for the most part.  The dollar was the unit of currency even though the yen was there.  They drove on the right hand side of the road like we do here.  But then at some time when I was over there, they switched over to driving on the left hand side of the road.  That was pretty peculiar because I was a driver as well.  So logistical person, but I also was a jeep driver so I drove colonels and people around the island a lot.  So--
Speaker 1: Okay, so that's an aspect of being a--that sounds like it would be a pretty good job for a driver to drive the colonels and--
Speaker 2:  	Oh it was a great job.  I enjoyed it.  I had my own jeep and I knew the island pretty good.  I can get colonels or whoever had to go from one end of the island to the other.  I knew the shortcuts.  I knew how to drive through rice paddies, it was pretty cool.
Speaker 1: So you would drive through the people's rice paddies.
Speaker 2:  	Oh yeah I did.
Speaker 1: Could you do it without destroying the rice?
Speaker 2:  	Oh yes, it was a path through there so, through there or around there because the main roads in Okinawa are very crowded as they are now.  But back then it was a lot of traffic, a lot of congestion and if the colonel had to be on another base for a meeting, they need to be there.  So I had to get 'em there.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So this is 1978, so how long did you serve in Okinawa?
Speaker 2:  	One year tour, from '78 [1978]--February 1978 to February 1979.
Story_ID: 650655
Speaker 1: So when you, in 1979, where did you go?
Speaker 2:  	I went to the 2nd Marine Division so I was very fortunate.  My first four years in the [U.S.] Marine Corps, I served in the 1st Marine Division at Camp Pendleton [Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton, San Diego County, California], the 3rd Marine Division in Okinawa [Okinawa Island, Japan], and then the 2nd Marine Division at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina [Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune, Jacksonville, North Carolina], so I hit all three divisions in four years.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So what did you do at Camp Lejeune?
Speaker 2:  	I was a logistical man and I was also a classified material control custodian.  I kind of maintained all the classified files.
Speaker 1: Okay, so these--
Speaker 2:  	And I drove a little bit too.
Speaker 1: So what does it entail to maintain classified files?
Speaker 2:  	The message traffic would come in every day.  I worked in a place called G4, the general offices four, four was the symbol for logistics, three was operations, two was intelligence, but four was logistics.  So I worked in a logistical shop and we was--we supported exercises on the base, around the base.  We were informed about real world situations, what's happening across the world and the country, particularly what was happening in the Miami [Florida] area in 1979, 1980 during the Mariel boatlift, when Castro [Fidel Castro] released all his citizens, mostly criminals to Florida.  We had to provide a lot of logistical support for that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I mean to pick them up right out of the sea (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2:  	(Simultaneous) We sent a lot of tents down there, a lot of cots, a lot of diapers and just (unclear) logistical support for that.  And then I drove a lot for the colonel again in Lejeune going from one LZ [landing zone] to the other, observing exercising, participating in exercises and just a lot of training.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you did that for how long?
Speaker 2:  	For almost two years to the day--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --from 1979 to 1981.
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And then it was time for me to reenlist.
Story_ID: 650656
Speaker 1: Now did you think about well you know maybe I want to do something else now or--?
Speaker 2:  	Oh yeah.  I thought about it, in--early on before I even went overseas.  But I got the opportunity to go back to Chicago [Illinois] and I saw there was nothing there for me.  Most of my friends were gone and I mean gone to school, to jail or gone dead and it was really nothing.  I didn't want to go back to Chicago.  It was boring to me, it was depressing to me.  By this time I had been overseas.  I had traveled through California.  I had had a couple of duty stations.  I had finally hopefully matured and had some direction in the [U.S.] Marine Corps and I didn't want to give it up.  I wanted to stay in the Marine Corps.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2:  	It wasn't a hard decision at all.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you reenlisted in '81 [1981] and--
Speaker 2:  	I believe I was '81 [1981], because when you reenlist you, back then and as of, as it is now you still get options.  And I got an option to, for a duty station which I waived it because I wanted to stay there in Lejeune [Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune, Jacksonville, North Carolina] but before I knew it, I got orders again to another infantry unit.  I got orders to I think it was 1st Battalion 8th Marines [1st Battalion 8th Marine Regiment] and I had already done some time with 1st [1st Marine Division], 2nd [2nd Marine Division] and 3rd Division [3rd Marine Division].  I really wanted to get out of the division and wanted to get out of the infantry units and I wanted to go to the air wing.  I wanted to see how the other half lived.  So when I got those orders to 8th Marines, I exercised my reenlistment option to go to Marine Corps Air Station Beaufort.  And I'm so glad I did exercise that option because 8th Marines ended up in Beirut two years later and 220 Marines got killed.  And I really believed I would have been in there if I wouldn't have exercised that option.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you were with the--you went to Beaufort, South Carolina?
Speaker 2:  	I went to Marine Corps Air Station Beaufort.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So now you were there quite a bit.  I'm looking over your outline.
Speaker 2:  	Yeah.
Speaker 1: I mean you were repeatedly in Okinawa [Okinawa Island, Japan] and Beaufort.
Speaker 2:  	Right.
Speaker 1: And there are other places too you go multiple times.
Speaker 2:  	Right.
Speaker 1: But, so Beaufort, now how did you, did you like it?
Speaker 2:  	I never even heard of Beaufort.  I just knew it was an air station and when you're in the infantry units or unit divisions, you always see how easy they have it with the air wing.  And so I wanted to have it easy.  I had four years of rough training exercises and participating in some real world type things and I wanted to have it easy so I wanted to go to the air wing.  So I looked on the map or the atlas and saw that the Marine Corps Air Station Beaufort wasn't too far from Lejeune; it was about three hundred miles south.  So, and I wanted to stay in the South.  I was in North Carolina.  I wanted to go to South Carolina.  So I wanted to go to the air wing.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2:  	Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now you, had you ever been south before, any really?
Speaker 2:  	In the South?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2:  	In my life, just one time and when I was eleven years old I went to Mississippi.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2:  	Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.  So did you like South Carolina?
Speaker 2:  	When I got there, no.  Almost every duty station I don't like when you first get there 'cause you don't know anybody.  The unknown is there.  You just don't know.  It's just, there's just so many question marks there.  So when I first got there I didn't like it at all.  But after I got there, after a few weeks I found out that it wasn't a bad place to be.  It was kind of a more of a laid back duty station, unlike the infantry and the division where you're always running or shooting or communicating and you're always working.  These guys actually take off and drink beer after work here so that was pretty cool to me.  But I still had a lot of infantry in me, a lot of--I was spitting polish and I was a sergeant at the time.  And when I saw people that weren't wearing the uniform right or were lackadaisical in their duties, I would correct them and I had it tough because there was a lot of resistance there, like Geeter [HistoryMaker Joe Geeter, III], you're not in the infantry anymore.  You're not with the division.  We do things different in the wings so I had a lot of resistance at first.  I had to learn how to blend in, so that was tough for me for the first six months.
Story_ID: 650657
Speaker 1: You didn't tell us about your promotion to sergeant.  So (unclear)?
Speaker 2:  	Well when I was overseas, we can go back to overseas, when I was in Japan [Okinawa Island, Japan] from 1978 to 1979, I received a meritorious promotion to corporal.  And a meritorious promotion is when you go in front of a board of senior enlisted people and they quiz you on your knowledge, your bearing.  They look at your record to find out if you should be promoted above your peers.  So I was promoted above my peers to the rank of corporal.  And now I was competing for sergeant along with every other corporal in the logistics field.  You have a point system, what they call a cutting score.  And you gain points by running, physical fitness, your rifle score has a lot to do with it, your military education, what schools you go to, all that factors into a cutting score.  So I knew I wanted to be a sergeant so I really tried to excel in physical fitness, I tried to excel in my scholastics, I tried to excel at the rifle range and I managed to make sergeant pretty soon after I made corporal.  I think I was a corporal in November 1978 and I made sergeant in January of 1980.  So I was only a corporal for fourteen months.  So I was a relatively young sergeant.
Speaker 1: And kind of run us through like what are the ranks for an enlisted man in the Marines?  You start off as a private first, a private, right?
Speaker 2:  	Yeah, private, then lance corporal, which is between private and corporal, so you're kind of getting ready to be a corporal.  When you make corporal, that's considered a non-commissioned officer rank.  You're given a little bit more authority.  So corporals and sergeants are non-commissioned officers.  Then you go to staff sergeant, which is a staff non-commissioned officer.  Staff sergeant, gunnery sergeant and then gunnery sergeant you had to make a choice.  You can either be a master sergeant and go with the technical field or you go administratively and go to first sergeant.  And first sergeants get promoted to sergeant majors.  Master sergeants get promoted to master gunnery.  So deep down in my heart I wanted to be a sergeant major, I really did.  I wanted to be a first sergeant or sergeant major.  But the [U.S.] Marine Corps thought otherwise when it came to that time.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2:  	Yeah.
Speaker 1: So the first promotion was just to staff sergeant, right?
Speaker 2:  	Sergeant in 1980 and then I made staff sergeant in 1983.  I was selected for staff sergeant '83 [1983].  I actually picked it up in '84 [1983] because when you get selected to staff sergeant above you get selected, then you have to wait on your seniority number to come up.  Sometimes it can be a manner of weeks or months or it could be a year or more because you actually, pin on the rank that you were selected for.
Speaker 1: Okay, and you made gunnery sergeant in, when you was at, in--?
Speaker 2:  	I made gunnery sergeant, I was selected for gunnery sergeant while I was at Beaufort [Marine Corps Air Station Beaufort, Beaufort, South Carolina] but I actually pinned on gunnery sergeant when I was a recruiter in Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 1: Okay, and that's in '87 [1987]?
Speaker 2:  	From '87 [1987] to '90 [1990], I was a recruiter in Chicago.
Story_ID: 650658
Speaker 1: So let's go back to, all right, so you're in Beaufort [Marine Corps Air Station Beaufort, Beaufort, South Carolina]; and you said you had to kind of get used to the ways of doing things there.  They're more (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2:  	(Simultaneous) The air wing way, yeah I did.
Speaker 1: Was the air wing kind of like the air force of the Marines or something?
Speaker 2:  	Yeah it was, it was laid back.
Speaker 1: Which is, I mean in terms of the laid backness of--
Speaker 2:  	The hair was a little bit longer, the uniform wasn't as squared away as I thought it should be coming out of the infantry, the division unit so it was a different culture.  But the first time I went to the field with these men, these Marines, they performed magnificently.  It was just incredible how well they knew their equipment, they knew how to operate the equipment, they knew their jobs.  So maybe in garrison they were kind of laid back but when it came to training and real world type of things they were very impressive.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So did, so you're in Beaufort, from eighty--I mean from--
Speaker 2:  	Eighty-one [1981], '83 [1983], the first tour.
Speaker 1: Eighty-one [1981], '83 [1983], okay sir.  Now were you back there in '84 [1984]?
Speaker 2:  	Yes, I left Beaufort in 1983 to go to Okinawa [Okinawa Island, Japan] and that was another one year tour from '83 [1983], '84 [1984].  And then after Okinawa, I came back to Beaufort.
Speaker 1: Then back to Beaufort, okay.  We have some other dates that are kind of mixed up on this outline but now I got it straight, now. So, so you were serving as logistics chief on this--in '84 [1984]?
Speaker 2:  	In my second tour, yes.  I was a logistics man the first tour I was a sergeant. But as a staff sergeant, now you can hold the (unclear) of a chief.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And it says here that you participated in numerous field exercises in Yuma, Arizona and other places.
Speaker 2:  	Oh yeah, Yuma, Arizona.  Yeah, that's a huge exercise that the [U.S.] Marine Corps does out there, probably twice a year now, it's called WTI, Weapons and Tactics Instructing--Instruction [sic. Weapon and Tactics Instructor course].  And we coordinate with the ground units, the air units in Yuma Proving Grounds [Yuma Proving Ground, Arizona] right in the middle of the desert.  When we get out there it's nothing but sand so we actually you know erect our city out there.  And we have to have everything logistically to survive out there and I was the logistics chief in charge of that.  So I had to make sure they had water, showers, food, toilets, place to sleep.  So I was, along with the logistical officer, in charge of the camp's makeup.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you were there from '84 [1984] to '87 [1987] is that three--?
Speaker 2:  	Eighty-seven [1987], my second tour in Beaufort, yes.
Speaker 1: All right, okay.  Now during this time are you, did you get married or anything and start a family or--?
Speaker 2:  	Oh no, I've been single my entire life here and all this jumping around has a lot to do with it, I'm sure here.
Speaker 1: Okay, 'cause you really move.
Speaker 2:  	Right.
Story_ID: 650659
Speaker 1: Well, in Chicago [Illinois], 1987--
Speaker 2:  	Oh, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So, you were a recruiter in Chicago.
Speaker 2:  	Yes, I was.
Speaker 1: And so, now how did they decide that was the best use of you?
Speaker 2:  	Well I went to recruiter school in 1987.  I was back at the Marine Corps Recruit Depot San Diego [San Diego, California] where I told you I witnessed my first recruit graduation.  And when you get close to graduating from recruiter school they have [U.S.] Marine Corps districts all across the country.  And what they do is they send representatives from those districts to the school to select which recruiters will fit in their geographical area and they're very specific.  They may want a Hispanic sergeant in Texas that's bilingual to recruit here or they want another specific set of geographical needs.  I was from Chicago, I was African American, I knew Chicago and I knew the person on the team that was coming to recruit.  I got real lucky where a Marine that I had known for years was part of that team to come select.  And we had communicated before and I had communicated to him that I want to go home.  Most folks wanted to go home.  So I figured I was ready to go to Chicago at that time.  I had been gone for eleven years and I wanted to go home.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So when you're on active duty as a recruiter in a city like Chicago, where do you live?  Where do you--?
Speaker 2:  	Well I actually lived out in Richton Park [Illinois], which is very south of Chicago.  It's about maybe ten miles south of the Chicago city limits.  So I lived in Richton Park but I actually did my recruiting not in Chicago as I thought I was going to be, but I did my recruiting in Joliet, Illinois.  So it was a little bit different for me.
Speaker 1: Joliet's the home of the big air base, [U.S.] Air Force base isn't it?
Speaker 2:  	No, there's a reserve Army base there, the proving grounds are there, but I don't know if there's an air base in Joliet.  Joliet, as far as a kid growing up in Chicago, the only thing I knew about Joliet was there was a prison there.
Speaker 1: Oh yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 2:  	(Simultaneous) The state prison is in Joliet [Joliet Correctional Center].
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2:  	Yeah.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Story_ID: 650660
Speaker 1: All right, just an official note here before we get started that observing is Valerie Marshall [ph.], Lucius Horace Snowten, Derek Snowten, Diane Turner and Thomas Turner [Thomas S. Turner, Sr.].
Speaker 2:  	Yes, sir.
Speaker 1: So, okay just want to make note there are observers here.  And sir, we left off with you, you were in Chicago [Illinois] as a recruiter.
Speaker 2:  	Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: And you were telling me where you were staying and, but you were really recruited in Joliet [Illinois]?
Speaker 2:  	In Joliet, yes I did.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2:  	For the most part.  When I got to Chicago I was told I was going to recruit in Chicago Heights [Illinois], which is just south of Morgan Park [Chicago, Illinois], not too far from Morgan Park.  So I got there in advance like we do, got my apartment, got everything settled.  The first day of work I was told that I was going to report to Joliet which is thirty miles to the west of where I was.  So just typical, maybe not typical but I adjusted.  [U.S.] Marine Corps, we have to adjust, adapt and overcome.  And I was a little upset at first because my apartment was maybe a mile from where I thought I was working and now I've got a thirty mile trek in Chicago and the winters are pretty bad there so it made for a rough commute going to Joliet.
Speaker 1: And the traffic is thick.  I mean I think that may be the toughest part.  Wasn't it?
Speaker 2:  	Not really, not where I was because I was south far enough where folks weren't commuting you know they were headed to Chicago.  So I was actually going on 80 West [Interstate 80] when they were going on 57 North [Interstate 57] to go into the city.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2:  	So it wasn't the amount of traffic it was just the length of the commute mainly here.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So you're living in Richton Park [Illinois] and commuting to Joliet?
Speaker 2:  	Yes I did.  And spent a lot of time in Chicago.
Story_ID: 650661
Speaker 1: Were your [maternal] grandparents still living?
Speaker 2:  	My grandmother [Anita Piper] was there when I first got there.  She eventually moved to New Jersey with my mother [Elma Geeter], but I think those first six months I was there was so important to me to have my grandmother there.  By now she, she's my best friend almost from the time growing up as I said earlier when she was the disciplinarian and used to catch me cutting school and everything.  Now it was time--she was proud of me, proud that I was in the [U.S.] Marine Corps, and looked forward to seeing her at least every Sunday.  Her church was only three blocks from my church in Chicago [Illinois].  I was still going to Holy Name of Mary [Holy Name of Mary Parish, Chicago, Illinois] and she was going to Bethany Baptist Church [ph.], it was maybe not even three blocks, maybe two blocks.  So I got out of church first and I would wait the half hour for her to get out of church and then we used to spend Sundays at her house watching the Cubs [Chicago Cubs] play baseball.  She was a big Cub fan.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2:  	So that was very good, very special six months that I had with her.
Speaker 1: Okay, so this--you got there in '87 [1987]. Let's see, so your grandfather [Ralph Piper] had passed away?
Speaker 2:  	My grandfather passed in November of 1978 when I was in Okinawa, Japan [Okinawa Island, Japan].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2:  	So my grandmother was still living in Chicago by herself; and she eventually moved with my mother to New Jersey in 1988.
Story_ID: 650662
Speaker 1: Now you had mentioned earlier that you had some of your father's [Joe Geeter, Jr.] qualities, reported qualities of being like a salesman and having the gift of gab and that sort of thing.
Speaker 2:  	Right.
Speaker 1: What was your spiel to potential [U.S.] Marine Corps recruits?
Speaker 2:  	I tried to make it as honest as I could.  As a matter of fact I made it tougher than it was because I didn't want them to get to boot camp and say hey, this is harder than I thought.  I'm going to quit.  My whole idea if I was to put you in the Marine Corps, enlist you in the Marine Corps then you were going to graduate a Marine and I was very determined to do that.  So we were very honest with them, very upfront.  We were very stringent in them participating in pool events.  Once a month you had to come to my pool event.  If you didn't come to my pool event and you were consistently not coming, I would try to discharge you out of my delayed entry program.  I just didn't want you in uniform if you weren't going to make a Marine.  And it paid off.  In fiscal year 1989, my recruiting station, substation sent eighty people to boot camp, seventy-nine graduated.  We had the highest graduation rate in the country at the time so we put in some good Marines.
Speaker 1: And now the other Marines I've interviewed and you to some extent said that you were challenged by the recruiter on some level.  I mean the other people said that the Marine Corps challenged them and they felt they had to prove something when they--
Speaker 2: I thought I did.  I really thought I did because of my size.  I was a small frame kind of guy.  I wasn't a muscular big guy and I wanted to prove that I could make it along with these big muscular guys.  So I had a chip on my shoulder, plus I had a point I wanted to prove.  I don't know if I had that chip when I was a gunnery sergeant as a recruiter in Chicago [Illinois] but I really wanted these young men to be successful because I knew that the Marine Corps did a lot for me.  I saw a lot of me in a lot of these seventeen and eighteen year olds that I was recruiting.  They may not have been great in high school, they may not have been great in athletics, but deep in their heart they wanted to be part of something bigger than them and I wanted to make sure they wanted to come in for the right reasons.  Too many people come in the service for a college education or to see the world and I reminded them the day may come when you get a phone call and you got to go somewhere and you got to do something unpleasant and then if you're not willing to do that, then you don't need to be in the Marine Corps.  You don't need to be in the service at all.  So I made sure that I talked to their families.  Recruiting is tough.  And you hate to say you're selective but you got to be selective 'cause I want to make sure they graduated.  Some recruiters go for the numbers.  They just know they have to put in so many people a month.  They don't really care if they're overweight or if they're going to make it through boot camp.  But I cared and I would make sure my recruiters that worked with me and for me cared as well.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So some people you actually tried to discourage if they--
Speaker 2:  	Oh yes.
Speaker 1: --you didn't think that they could--?
Speaker 2:  	I did.  I discouraged a lot of people as a matter of fact.  And a lot of my fellow recruiters looked at me like you're out of your mind Joe [HistoryMaker Joe Geeter, III].  Why aren't you going for the numbers, because it was a big deal on recruiting duty to be a centurion, to recruit a hundred Marines or enlistees.  That was never a goal of mine.  I just wanted the ones that I recruit to be Marines and to be successful Marines because I knew I was responsible for that.  When I was in recruiting school we had a recruiter come give us a speech and he had recruited a lot, in the '80s [1980s], the early '80s [1980s].  And it turns out that four or five young men that he recruited wound up in Beirut in 1983 and they died on that fateful day on October 23rd, 1983.  And he said he had to go look at their families and say that you know that he did his best to recruit the best and that they were good Marines.  And if he would have frauded them in the Marine Corps or lied to them or deceived them to come to the Marine Corps, how can you live with yourself if one of these kids get killed in combat.  So I took that very seriously.
Story_ID: 650663
Speaker 1: Now you were in Chicago [Illinois] in 1987.  This is when Chicago had its first black mayor, and he actually--
Speaker 2:  	Matter of fact, Harold Washington died when I was there.  He died in November of--
Speaker 1: Eighty-seven [1987].
Speaker 2:  	--eighty-seven [1987].  I remember sitting in my recruiting office in the chair, listening on the radio that he had died.  Yeah, that hurt cause I--it felt good to be in Chicago, felt good that we had a black mayor that was from the South Side of Chicago who freely moved around the South Side of Chicago who interacted with the people.  I felt it was a good time for me to be in Chicago as an African American Marine recruiter.  I felt real good being there.
Speaker 1: Now did you during this term in Chicago or any time before that, did you ever get a chance to talk to your father [Joe Geeter, Jr.]?
Speaker 2:  	Oh yes, many times.  My father and I developed our relationship almost immediately after boot camp.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well tell us about that.  Now how did you finally track him down?
Speaker 2:  	Well I kind of knew where he lived but I never had the, I guess the courage to go to his house.  One day I went to his house right before I went to boot camp and so he knew I was in boot camp and he told me that when I got out of boot camp to come back and visit him if I wanted to.  So, and I did.  Matter of fact he was one of the first stops I made when I graduated or when I finished boot camp in December 1976.  And I saw, he was extremely proud of me.  He had remarried at the time so I had a stepmother, Olivia O. [Olivia Geeter], who readily accepted me as her son and didn't want to relive the past or go about why he wasn't in my life.  That wasn't important.  The important thing was, I'm eighteen years old and I'm in the [U.S.] Marine Corps and this is my father.  So we developed a very, very close relationship from the time I was eighteen 'til the time he died, six years ago.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2:  	But when I was in Chicago he was my biggest fan.  He attended my promotion to gunnery sergeant.  He attended the Marine Corps ball with me.  He was there with me when I got my first award and when I got my first Marine Corps sword that was awarded to me for recruiting excellence.  So he was very much a part of my life in Chicago during those three years I was there.
Speaker 1: Okay, good 'cause I wondered what happened to that part of the story and wanted to revisit that and see. Did, did you ever--wa- was your [paternal] grandfather still alive or did you (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2:  	(Simultaneous) Oh yes.  And my grandfather Joe Geeter [Joe Geeter, Sr.], I didn't have too much contact with him growing up as well because I didn't have contact with my father.  I knew who he was.  I knew that he was a cop.  I knew that he still lived on 7120 South Prairie Street [sic. Prairie Avenue] but I never really made contact with him.  But in 1987 when I was a recruiter I was determined to get to know him more, to find out about who he was so I knocked on his door.  I had an address, I just walked over there one Sunday morning and knocked on his door.  And he gave me a bear hug that I wouldn't believe.  He just instantly accepted me you know in his life and his wife's life, Sylvia's [Sylvia Chandler Geeter] life.  So I spent most Sundays over his house when I wasn't visiting with my grandmother [Anita Piper].  So family was very important to me when I was in Chicago [Illinois].  I wanted to, I guess I wanted to make up too, a lot myself because again I was a troubled youth, I was a tough youth but my family was always there for me.  They never turned their back on me.  So now that I was, had some kind of level of success, I just wanted them to revel in it as well.
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So it was important.
Story_ID: 650664
Speaker 1: So you were in Chicago [Illinois] for, from 1987 until, when was it?
Speaker 2:  	'Til 1990.
Speaker 1: 'Til 1990.
Speaker 2:  	Yes, incredible three years here.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now you were promoted, were promoted to gunnery sergeant in '87 [1987]?   Was it '87 [1987] or--?
Speaker 2:  	In 1987, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2:  	Right there in Chicago.  And what's very good about that was when I was promoted to gunnery sergeant is when I started to learn the history about gunnery sergeants, the [U.S.] Marine Corps.  As I said earlier I was a very, much the history buff but then I started learning about black Marines before me and Chicago was really my indoctrination into the Montford Point Marines [Montford Point Marine Association, Inc.] because as I mentioned earlier they had a chapter in Chicago on 70th [Street] and Vincennes [Avenue] that I would attend events there, weddings and the like, color guard details.  And one day I was attending a color guard detail, I had a beer afterwards and I was walking out the door.  Well a young man, a man came up to me and says you need to stay here and learn about the history about what you, what you're around.  And that man was Sol Griffin [Sol Griffin, Jr.].  He sat me down and told me the story about the Montford Point Marines so that's when I got started with the Montford Point Marines.
Speaker 1: Sol Griffin, so he was one of the original Montford--?
Speaker 2:  	Oh yes he was.  He was a legend in Chicago.
Speaker 1: Okay. And, so they were at 71st [Street] and Vincennes?
Speaker 2:  	Yeah, 70th and Vincennes.
Speaker 1: 70th and Vincennes, okay, all right.  And the headquarters is still there?
Speaker 2:  	Oh yes, it's still there, same building.  I go there almost every time I go to Chicago.
Story_ID: 650665
Speaker 1: All right, so were you surprised, had you thought before about the history of the black-- blacks in the [U.S.] Marine Corps (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2:  	(Simultaneous) Yes, I did.  I did, as a matter of fact I had taught a lot of that history but I never had any firsthand instruction from a Montford Point Marine.  So even though I was teaching the classes, I taught African Americans in the military in 1978 when I was in Japan [Okinawa Island, Japan] for the first time.  So I knew the history but I never really interacted with the actual Montford Pointers until 1987.
Speaker 1: Now when you were preparing to teach African Americans in the military, what did you, what were your reference books and means of (unclear)?
Speaker 2:  	One book was 'Blacks in the Marine Corps' [Henry I. Shaw, Jr. and Ralph W. Donnelly].  It was published in 1975, which really documented the African American Marines, the Montford Point Marines.  A lot of [U.S.] Department of Defense publications I used.  There was no Internet back then so I can't quote all the books, but trust me they're in this basement somewhere.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So you really, you studied like black presence in the U.S. military period (unclear)?
Speaker 2:  	Oh absolutely in all branches of service.  I was just so interested in the history.  So little of it was taught to me in school but as I came into the military and talked to my [maternal] grandfather [Ralph Piper] and talked to my dad [Joe Geeter, Jr.], talked to my uncle who was a [U.S.] Navy corpsman who served with the Montford Point Marines, I was just interested to find out how far did it go back, where did it start, you know, what did they go through?  So I really immersed myself in that history and I started teaching it thirty-five years ago and been teaching it ever since.
Story_ID: 650666
Speaker 1: Well this is as good a time as any, just kind of give us sort of a sketch of the history of mon- of the blacks in the U.S. Marine Corps.
Speaker 2:  	Oh that's the easy stuff there.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2:  	Well prior to World War II [WWII], there were no blacks in the Marine Corps.  There are some documented cases of blacks serving during revolutionary times but they didn't serve as open enlisted Marines, most of the time they have served in the stead of somebody else during revolutionary times.  Blacks had served in the [U.S.] Army.  The Buffalo Soldiers people are familiar with them, the 54th Massachusetts Regiment [54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry Regiment].  Everybody saw them most people have seen the film 'Glory' with Denzel Washington.  Blacks have served in the [U.S.] Navy since revolutionary times too.  The [U.S.] Air Force wasn't in existence yet.  It didn't come into existence 'til 1948, but there were no blacks in the Marine Corps.  Around that time blacks were starting to fight for jobs in the [U.S.] Department of Defense.  And a gentleman named A. Philip Randolph was really petitioning Franklin Delano Roosevelt, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt to open up the defense agency for African Americans.  And he actually threatened a march on Washington [D.C.] in 1941 to make his point.  And we all know that I think 1942 is an election year and Franklin Delano Roosevelt really needed the black vote.  So June of 1941, he signed an Executive Order 8802, which allowed for blacks to have, to compete for jobs in the Department of Defense, specifically in the Marine Corps.  So that document is very important to, it should be important to all Marines, but particularly the African American, the Montford Point Marines because that document allowed them to become Marines.  Now although that document was signed in 1941, the Marine Corps didn't start accepting blacks until June of 1942, fully a full year after an executive order.  That's because the Marines didn't want us.  The commandant of the Marine Corps, Thomas Holcomb at the time didn't want blacks in the Marine Corps.  He was asked if it was a choice between 250 blacks or five thousand whites, which would you take?  His answer was, I'd rather have the whites.  And you got to keep in mind, this is the commandant of the Marine Corps, we're on the verge of World War II, if not in World War II at the time, but his disdain for African Americans was so deep that he just didn't want them in the Marine Corps.  But he has a, an executive order that he has to comply with.  So after about a year of going back and forth with Frank Knox who was the secretary of the navy at the time, the Marine Corps finally complied with the executive order and they started enlisting blacks on 1 June 1942.  But these blacks did not go to the Marine Corps Recruit Depot San Diego [San Diego, California] like I did or Marine Corps Recruit Depot Parris Island [Parris Island, South Carolina] like most Marines go to.  They went to a place in Camp Lejeune [Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune, Jacksonville, North Carolina], originally called Mumford Point [sic.].  It changed to Montford Point [Camp Gilbert H. Johnson, Jacksonville, North Carolina] and I really don't know the origin on how it changed but the tract of land was Mumford, M-U-M-F-O-R-D [sic.], but it ended up being called Montford, M-O-N-T-F-O-R-D.  And it was located on New River, about eighty miles from the big base being built called Camp Lejeune.  So it was a separate facility that no more than woods and trees and bears and mosquitoes and they had to build those first arrivals there almost had to build the base.  So from 1942 to 1949, approximately twenty thousand men went through Montford Point; and those men became known as the chosen few, the first black Marines.  And that was very, very important to me to learn this history and to know this history.
Story_ID: 650667
Speaker 1: So you joined the Montford Point Marine Association [Montford Point Marine Association, Inc.] in Chicago [Illinois]?
Speaker 2:  	Yes, I did, 1987.  I didn't know I joined.  But Sol Griffin [Sol Griffin, Jr.] asked for twenty-five dollars for my membership, never got a card.  So I'm sure he put that twenty-five dollars to good use.  But I became a member in Chicago, of the Chicago chapter and then I went overseas again to Okinawa [Okinawa Island, Japan] after my tour of recruiting duty.  But then I went to San Diego, California [Marine Corps Recruit Depot San Diego]. I--
Speaker 1: So this is 1990 you went back to Okinawa again, right?
Speaker 2:  	Nineteen ninety [1990], I went back to Okinawa after my tour was up there.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And just briefly, what did you do in Okinawa on this, this is the third or fourth--?
Speaker 2:  	That was my third tour.
Speaker 1: Third tour, okay.
Speaker 2: In 1990.  In 1990, I was the plans and deployment chief, working out of the G3.  Again, as I said earlier G4 was logistics, G3 was operations.  So now I was in the operational side of the house.  So I did plans and deployments at what we call group level, the higher headquarters level for all the exercises and contingencies going on around Okinawa.  So I was the, a good plans chief.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So did you know a lot of the people in Okinawa or did the personnel change since you--?
Speaker 2:  	Oh yeah, it constantly changes.  But by this time I had been in the [U.S.] Marine Corps fourteen years.  This is my third tour overseas.  I had a lot of friends so I was no stranger for me to be in Okinawa.  I was very familiar with the island because as I said earlier I was a driver on that island from 1978 to 1979, and I was also on the island from '83 [1983] to '84 [1984], so I was very familiar with the island.  So by the time I got to the third tour, I felt like I was home.  But now I'm a gunnery sergeant and I'm working at a higher headquarters so it's just a greater level of responsibility.
Speaker 1: Now you go to the Philippines in '91 [1991], right?
Speaker 2:  	Yes.  When I was in Okinawa on--I got there in 1990 on August 2nd.  Nineteen ninety [1990] was when Sadan--Saddam Hussein crossed over into Kuwait, so we were preparing to go to Korea at the time but they stopped the exercise because now a real world situation was developing and we all had to get back to our units and prepare for whatever that future was going to land or whatever was going to happen there.  But as much as I tried, I couldn't get to Saudi Arabia, couldn't get over that battle over there but something else was happening in the Philippines at the time so we went down to the Philippines as part of an exercise, but the Marine Air Control Group--I'm sorry the Marine Air Task Force, I believe the number was 4 dash 90 [Marine Air Ground Task Force 4-90], but we did a lot of logistical support, supporting the infantry people in the field down in the Philippines.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay. Now this is '91 [1991] is the Gulf War [Persian Gulf War].  As you said, Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait.
Speaker 2:  	Yes.
Speaker 1: And then the U.S. had to respond--so later on in '91 [1991], to it.
Story_ID: 650668
Speaker 1: Now back in San Diego [California] in '91 [1991], right?
Speaker 2:  	Yes.  When I left Okinawa [Okinawa Island, Japan] in, I want to say June of 1991, I went to Marine Corps Recruit Depot San Diego [San Diego, California].
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  And you were there for three years?
Speaker 2:  	I got there in '91 [1991], I left in '94 [1994].  So I was there for three years.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So basically were you doing the same job you did in Chicago [Illinois] in--?
Speaker 2:  	Oh no, not at the recruit depot.  Actually, first I did not want to go to San Diego.  It was the West Coast.  I really did my tours out there earlier in my career.  I wanted to go back to Chicago to be a recruiter or I wanted to go to Beaufort, South Carolina or North Carolina, somewhere in the Fleet Marine Force where I could be with the operational forces.  When you're on a Marine Corps recruit depot, you're not with the operational forces.  You don't even get a weapon.  You're just maintaining the base, maintaining whatever that base does.  This case was a training facility so I was providing logistics for a training facility.  So I kind of resisted going there but it ended up being one of my favorite duty stations.
Speaker 1: Okay, any stories from then to (unclear)?
Speaker 2:  	A lot of stories.  Mainly, it starts off with the Montford Pointers like a lot of things are going to start off with, start from this time going forward because the San Diego chapter [of the Montford Point Marine Association, Inc.] had a clubhouse too and they were getting ready to host the national convention there.  So they asked me to tag along to help out with that convention.  So I got a chance to meet a great number of Montford Point Marines out there. Not only just Montford Point Marines, I met a lot of heroes out there.  I met a guy called Howard out there and that name may be, may mean little to a lot of folks but Jimmie Howard meant a lot to a lot of Marines.  Jimmie Howard was a recipient of the Congressional Medal of Honor for his actions in Vietnam [Vietnam War] and I got a chance to really meet him and become very close friends with Jimmie Howard and his family.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What is his story now, in terms of the congressional medal (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2:  	(Simultaneous) Jimmie Howard?
Speaker 1: Yes sir.
Speaker 2:  	Jimmie Howard was a big guy.  He was about 6'2" and that was big in the '50s [1950s].  He was from Burlington, Iowa, went to one school, I think he went to Iowa, University of Iowa [Iowa City, Iowa] for one year when the Korean War broke out.  So he enlisted in the [U.S.] Marine Corps, went to the Korean War as an infantry man, fought very gallantly there, was the recipient of the Silver Star, which is the third highest medal for valor for his work in Korea.  And when Vietnam broke out, Jimmie was an old man.  He was about thirty, thirty-three years old which is an old man as far as Marine infantry men are concerned.  But he was with 1st recon [1st Reconnaissance Battalion] and he was in a place called Hill 48 [sic. Hill 488] and he took an eighteen man patrol on Hill 48 to observe the valley below and to call in artillery and naval gunfire.  He did a good job.  He had some accurate call ins for naval gunfire and artillery where the North Vietnamese finally figured out that somebody's spotting us.  Somebody's up in these hills and they know where they are and they're calling in some deadly artillery fire on us.  So the Vietcong went after him.  It's Jimmie Howard, eight people in a platoon on the top of a hill, Hill No. 48 in Vietnam.  The stories vary on what the Vietnamese sent after him.  Some people say it was a couple of companies, some people say it was a battalion, I've even heard it was a regiment.  But I think everybody understands it was about three or four hundred people going after eighteen people.  Jimmie had a forward listening post out there and when the North Vietnamese came close it activated the forward listening post and they scrambled back to the top of the hill to try to seek cover.  But the only thing on top of that hill was a boulder the size of a Volkswagen they had to kind of get behind for cover.  But they ended up fighting the Vietcong all day and all night for two nights, three nights straight.  When the helicopter support arrived on the third day, I believe his platoon was down to eight rounds.  But Jimmie Howard all during this fight went from position to position, encouraging his men, directing their fire, making sure they had fire discipline.  He had learned a trick in Korea whereas if you throw a rock and the plunk that it sounds when it lands sounds like a grenade.  And the Vietnamese would give up their position to move to a safer position.  So he had his men throw rocks and when they got them to move he would snap them off one shot at a time.  So they were highly effective fire.  Man for man it was probably the most decorated platoon in Marine Corps history.  Eighteen members of that platoon, four died.  Every last one of them got hit at least one time.  Four of them received the Navy Cross, the second highest award that the United States offered for valor in combat.  Every other member of that platoon received the Silver Star, the third highest award that the United States offer is for combat and Jimmie Howard was awarded the Medal of Honor by President Lyndon Baines Johnson.  And he kind of went to obscurity afterwards. He retired from the Marine Corps, went to Point Loma, San Diego.  He had six kids.
Story_ID: 650669
Speaker 1: He decided to volunteer for a football team.  He was the manager.  In other words, he took care of the equipment.  One day Jimmie Howard comes on Marine Corps Recruit Depot San Diego [San Diego, California] looking for some sea bags because his football team had finally made the playoffs and they didn't have the right equipment to haul the equipment to the next team.  So Jimmie being the Marine that he was said I'm going to go to Marine Corps Recruit Depot San Diego, I'm going to see the supply sergeant and he's going to lend me some sea bags.  Well supply sergeants are very possessive of their gear.  I mean they think it's theirs.  So he went down there not saying who he was and just asked to borrow some sea bags and the supply sergeant wouldn't give it to him.  But Jimmie knew the chain of command so he went to the higher headquarters.  I worked in the higher headquarters so he walked in my office one day and I was a gunnery sergeant.  He was a gunny when he was awarded the Medal of Honor.  And so from one gunny to the other he says, "Hey gunny, I need some sea bags."  I said, "Well what you got sir?"  He, then he explained to me why he needed 'em and I looked in the regulations and I found out that we can lend sea bags and other gear to nonprofits such as schools and the like here.  So even though that supply sergeant was a master sergeant and I was a gunnery sergeant, I was still senior to him because I worked for a colonel up at headquarters.  So I called down to supply and says you know give this man the sea bags.  And needless to say the master sergeant wasn't happy with me because he already told him no and I kind of overrode him even though I was junior to him.  So he gave Jimmie the sea bags and he took them to his kids and they--he was the hero now because he got the sea bags.  He forgot to tell the kids that he had borrowed the sea bags.  The kids wrote their names, the school fight song, everything they could imagine on those sea bags.  So Jimmie has his hat in his hand.  He goes back to the supply sergeant and says, the sea bags are slightly damaged and of course the supply sergeant goes through the roof and wants to charge him full price and I think it was forty dollars.  It was forty sea bags, forty dollars, sixteen hundred dollars, that he did not have.  So he comes back up to me in supplies and says, "Gunny, I let you down."  He said, "I didn't tell my Indians," and he called them his Indians.  He said, "I didn't tell my little Indians that these were borrowed and they messed them up.  And now the supply sergeant wants fifteen hundred dollars.  I just don't have the money."  So I looked back in the regulations and find out if we lend something out and it comes back damaged, we can do what they call a Code H and bring the value down where you only have to pay a fraction of that.  And so he was ever grateful, forever grateful for me for that so he went back and paid $150 I think for the sea bags 'cause he knew he had some responsibility but not fifteen hundred worth.  So when he was walking out my office he was walking down the hall, the depot sergeant major sees him, comes to attention and gives him the salute.  And I'm like, why the heck did he do that?  Why is this old man ready to salute?  Who the heck is this guy?  And sergeant major comes in my office and says, "Hey, what was Jimmie Howard doing here?"  I said, "Jimmie Who?"  He says, "Jimmie Howard.  You don't know who Jimmie Howard is?"  I said, "Well I don't."  And he says, "Let me tell you about the Battle of Hill 48 [sic. Battle of Hill 488]," and he told me that story.  And this man could have walked on that recruit depot, he could have walked off with the flagpole with the Medal of Honor.  But he figured Marines take care of Marines.  He just went down there unassuming and asked for help.  And I was glad that I could give him a little help.  But Jimmie Howard and I became very, very good friends afterwards and I would call him on the [U.S.] Marine Corps birthday and rouse him up and he would take me with him and teach me how to take care of veterans.  He always visited veterans in the hospital, bought them books, looked after their well being.  He was just a great, great human being, American and you would never know that he was a Medal of Honor recipient.  And the story gets even better.  One day I'm sitting at my desk.  I get a phone call from Dan Mulvihill [Daniel Mulvihill], Staff Sergeant Dan Mulvihill who I served with on recruit duty in Chicago [Illinois].  He was a Silver Star recipient.  And when you see Marines with a Silver Star, you don't ask them about it, you know you just kind of understand that they must have did something special.  Well Dan was a Silver Star recipient and he called me, he says, "Joe [HistoryMaker Joe Geeter, III], I'm coming out to San Diego [California].  My son's graduating from boot camp."  I says, "Good, whatever I can get for you, I'm the logistics chief.  You need transportation, need a room on base, whatever you need I can get it for you."  He says, "I do need one thing."  He said, "I lost contact with my son's godfather and I really want him to come to graduation."  I said, "Well who's his godfather?"  "Jimmie Howard."  Dan was on the hill with Jimmie Howard and I think to a man they made a deal with Jimmie, you get me off this hill alive and when I have kids, you're going to be their godfather.  Jimmie had a few godsons and goddaughters.  So Jimmie showed up at this kid's graduation.  His dad has a Silver Star, his godfathers held the Medal of Honor, very special day there.  So Jimmie Howard's very special.  He died, of all things, he made it through Korea [Korean War], Silver Star, Vietnam [Vietnam War], Medal of Honor, couple of Purple Hearts.  I mean just a Marine's Marine.  He died from diabetes--tripping over a water sprinkler that got his ankle infected and he died.  So at his funeral at Rosecrans Cemetery [Fort Rosecrans National Cemetery, San Diego, California], his wife, his widow was there, his kids was there; and Jimmie and I again had become quite close.
Story_ID: 650670
Speaker 1: But not a lot of people knew about Jimmie Howard.  So I promised his widow that day at the cemetery [Fort Rosecrans National Cemetery, San Diego, California] that I was going to do anything in my power to make sure that the Marines and America found out about this hero, Jimmie Howard.  So I went on a personal campaign writing congress people, writing the historical society and somebody finally answered one of my letters.  And about thirteen years ago, the secretary of the navy [John H. Dalton] announced that there was going to be a ship called the USS Jimmie Howard [USS Howard DDG 83], destroyer, so five years of efforts really paid off there to get a ship called the Jimmie Howard.  So I was lucky to go to Bath, Maine to watch the keel be lain, watch the christening and I was at the commissioning ceremony in Galveston, Texas and I was utterly amazed that that ship is home ported in San Diego [California].  And literally if you could stand on Jimmie Howard's grave and look out at San Diego Harbor, and you could see that ship coming in, just an incredible moment here.  So Jimmie Howard was always very, very special to me.  And now there's a U.S. ship out there, U.S. destroyer--the USS DDG, Jimmie Howard.
Story_ID: 650671
Speaker 1: Okay, so in 1995, you're back in Beaufort [Marine Corps Air Station Beaufort, Beaufort, South Carolina] again, right?
Speaker 2:  	I got back to (pronunciation) Beaufort in (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Beaufort, yeah I guess that's--
Speaker 2:  	Yeah, it's (pronunciation) Beaufort in North Carolina [sic.] and it's spelled exactly the same.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I've heard it pronounced--
Speaker 2:  	Like (pronunciation) Geeter and (pronunciation) Geeter, it depends on where you're from.  But it's actually Beaufort in South Carolina.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2:  	So yes, I arrived in Beaufort for my fourth and final tour, not only at Beaufort but from the [U.S.] Marine Corps, in 1995.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So you served as logistics chief there really in Beaufort?
Speaker 2:  	Yes, I was the third time.  I was the logistics chief the third time there but I was a staff sergeant there.  So I was, it was really a master sergeant's billet but now when I get back for the third tour in Beaufort, I am a master sergeant so that--I am a, I am the logistics chief for Marine Air Control Squadron 2.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you're a master sergeant here instead of a gunnery and so you're?
Speaker 2:  	In Beaufort, 1995?
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2:  	Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay. So this is your last tour or your last assignment?
Speaker 2:  	Yes it is.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now you weren't in, so you weren't in Yuma [Yuma Proving Ground, Arizona] in (unclear)?
Speaker 2:  	Well from Beaufort I went to Yuma.  That was my first field exercise.  I believe I arrived in Beaufort in I want to say August of '95 [1995]; and by September I was back in the desert, in Yuma.
Story_ID: 650672
Speaker 1: Is there any stories from Beaufort [Marine Corps Air Station Beaufort, Beaufort, South Carolina]?
Speaker 2:  	Oh great stories, start from when I first got there, starting before I got there actually.  When I was in Okinawa [Okinawa Island, Japan], I actually had orders to California.  And as much as I resisted going to San Diego [Marine Corps Recruit Depot San Diego, San Diego, California] back in 1991, I had made friends there.  I had met a young lady there and I wanted to go back there.  And I thought I was going back there until my last week of Japan on Okinawa when I received a phone call from Beaufort that the logistics chief there had been relieved of his duties and they were about to deploy to the field and they wanted a logistics chief.  And the phone call came from a lieutenant colonel, Debra Ellick [ph.], who had I had served with in Beaufort when she was a second lieutenant fifteen years earlier.  I knew Colonel Ellick her whole career, she knew me my whole career.  We worked together, we served together, we kind of knew each and how to work.  And she asked me if I would consider changing my orders and I had to think long and hard about it because I really wanted to get back to California to meet this young lady again.  But I thought about my duties and this unit and how they needed a logistical chief and I agreed to change my orders at the last minute to go to Beaufort.  So when I get there, I was promised to be not the logistics chief but the logistics officer which is a higher billing.  So I would be the guy making the, all the decisions as far as logistically for this unit that was about to go for a big exercise in the desert [at Yuma Proving Ground, Arizona].  So I was excited about that.  I knew I had almost twenty years in [U.S.] Marine Corps.  I came in, in '76 [1976], this was '95 [1995], had nineteen years in the Marine Corps.  I was a master sergeant.  This is going to be my twilight tour at a unit that I was very familiar with, that I had served with twice before in Beaufort so I was feeling pretty good about myself one day and I was sitting in the office looking out the window and I see this female officer in her full uniform struggling with her bags trying to make it up the steps to the unit.  And I kind of laughed to my Marines I'm like, "Look at this second lieutenant.  She can't even walk and talk at the same time."  You know, "Where the heck is she going?"  Twenty minutes later I found out where she was going, sergeant major walked in my office and said, "Master Sergeant Geeter [HistoryMaker Joe Geeter, III], this is your new boss," a second lieutenant, a female.  Not that I had anything against females but second lieutenant, I thought I was through training second lieutenants.  I thought I was on my twilight tour.  And I kind of looked at her and she looked like she didn't know her left from her right 'cause she didn't. She was a second lieutenant.  She was, I found out later a management information major out of University of Phoenix I believe it was and I was wondering how in heck she wound up in the Marine Corps and how in the heck I was going to train a second lieutenant.  And when the Marines left, the lieutenant looked at me and she sat down.  I'm a master sergeant and master sergeants have some level of respect, almost instant respect just because of the rank cause they know you didn't get there overnight here.  And she looked at me, she says, "Master Sergeant Geeter," she said, "I don't know anything."  She said, "I need you to teach me."  And from that point on I made it my point to teach her, because some second lieutenants because they went to college, because they have a commission, they automatically think they know more than you and they try to direct you from the beginning.  Well this lieutenant knew--and she was probably trained well in officer candidate school [Officer Candidates School] that when you get to your unit, find that senior enlisted person and listen to them.  They'll help you out.  So she listened and when she told me that she really humbled herself when she didn't have to.  She could have came in there barking orders and I would have to say, "Yes ma'am, yes ma'am."
Story_ID: 650673
Speaker 1: So she wanted to learn logistics, specifically she wanted to learn combat logistics.  I had been in logistical field at this time for nearly twenty years.  I think I knew the field as good as anybody in the [U.S.] Marine Corps at the time and I was--felt good about teaching her.  And she was a sponge, she learned everything.  She learned it so well and so fast, I was just impressed with her, how she took care of the Marines, she really impressed me.  And she was volunteering to go everywhere.  Any time we had a contingency or something her name was, her hand was in the air.  So when we had to go to Yuma, Arizona [Yuma Proving Ground] she asked me and that's weird, she asked me if she could go on the advanced party and so I sent her out on the advanced party while I stayed in the back to load the equipment, to load the planes up to get out there.  And I put her in charge of setting up the camp and when you set up a camp, you have it set up a specific way.  You have to have tents a certain way, the chow hall in a certain place, the port-o-johns in a certain place, preferably away from the chow hall and down wind.  This was her first time setting up the camp and she didn't really set it up well at all.  The wind was blowing, the prevailing winds was blowing in the direction of the chow hall and she put the port-o-johns right there so you don't want to be eating chow and having that.  And then she set up her tent way in the back by the air traffic controllers because they were her friends and she wanted to stay with her friends.  But she didn't realize as the logistical officer for that camp you have to set up at the front so you control everything that comes in and out of that camp.  So I kind of got there and had to straighten things out a little bit but she learned and she really took that knowledge and the next time we went to the field she had everything dead center, she was right on time.  And I was so proud of her because, number one, I thought I was going to be the logistical officer and she was it.  And I understood that because it was a rank thing and she was commissioned, I was not.  But I was so proud of her and became, I became a mentor to her and her a mentor to me that I asked her to reenlist me.  In the Marine Corps, you get two times where you can almost run the show and that's when you reenlist and when you get promoted.  If at all possible, your commanding officer will allow you to say who you want to do the ceremony, where you want to do it, how you want to do it.  I've known Marines that reenlisted under water.  I know Marines that reenlisted on Iwo Jima [Japan], on top of buildings, on the obstacle course.  I wanted to reenlist at the Marine Corps ball and I had lieutenant, now Captain Garcia [ph.] reenlist me at the ball.  And then when, a year later when I made master gunnery sergeant, Captain Garcia was the official that read my warrant for master gunnery sergeant.  Now Captain Garcia is now Lieutenant Colonel Garcia.  She's had multiple tours in Afghanistan, in Iraq.  She's combat decorated. She's going to be a colonel one day.  She may even be a general one day and I feel very proud that I was the first enlisted person that encountered her to help her with her--get her career started.  And she would tell anybody that will listen to her that Master Sergeant Geeter [HistoryMaker Joe Geeter, III] got her career started.

Speaker 1: Tell us about the Equal Opportunity Management Institute [Defense Equal Opportunity Management Institute].
Speaker 2:  	While, while stationed at, in Beaufort [Marine Corps Air Station Beaufort, Beaufort, South Carolina], I was with a, a combat unit, a Fleet Marine Force unit, an air control squadron and pretty happy because I was with Marines.  I received a phone call from headquarters of the [U.S.] Marine Corps from an old friend of mine who was a Marine Corps captain.  He was now a civilian working the equal opportunity branch.  The Marine Corps had finally embraced equal opportunity.  Not that they were against equal opportunity but the other branches of the service were way ahead of us as far as management programs for equal opportunity.  The [U.S.] Air Force ran the premiere--I'm sorry, [U.S.] Department of Defense ran the premiere Equal Opportunity Management Institute aboard an Air Force base, Patrick Air Force Base in Florida.  So I got a call from Ron Bickerstaff who asked me if I wanted to join those ranks and be an equal opportunity advisor.  I knew of them.  I knew the school was grueling.  I knew it would take me out of my regular duties as a Marine Corps logistician but I decided I wanted to do it.  He asked me to do it.  It's not often that you get a call from the headquarters of the Marine Corps, personally asking you to do something.  So I took up the challenge again and went to school down at Patrick Air Force Base for sixteen weeks to learn how to be an equal opportunity advisor to commander. So when I graduated from school I was assigned to the Marine Corps air station to the commanding officer, Colonel Stack [ph.] at the time, and I was his equal opportunity advisor.  So my job was to educate Marines on sexual harassment, discrimination, hazing, to teach them how not to do it, to establish programs to make sure everybody was educated on how to behave as Marines.  I inspected a lot of units there.  I held a lot of climate surveys there and I was pretty much the commanding officer's go to guy when it came to equal opportunity and those forms of discrimination and hazing.  So that was my last tour of duty as an equal opportunity advisor.
Story_ID: 650675
Speaker 1: Any stories from that, that tour that?
Speaker 2:  	Well, great stories.  Number one, they didn't want me at first because I was a master sergeant at the time and the lieutenant colonel who was the second in command or maybe the third in command really didn't want any master sergeants because he just had a gunnery sergeant who again was relieved of his duties.  And he figured a master sergeant would just be there to coast to retirement and not get any real work done.  So when I first reported there, he had my desk, I didn't have an office.  I had a desk directly in front of his desk.  I mean I would sit there and have to look at this man all day long.  So I made up my mind early that I was going to spend most of my time in the field and with the Marines [U.S. Marine Corps].  So instead of sitting at that desk at the station headquarters, I was out in the field teaching equal opportunity, eating in the chow hall, talking to Marines and developing my program.  About four months later I came to work one day and my desk had been moved to an office.  He finally gave me my office.  He said he had underestimated me.  He didn't think I was going to work as hard as I did and thought I was deserving of an office.  So and that same lieutenant colonel, I gave him the honor of reenlisting me for the last time.
Story_ID: 650676
Speaker 1: Well what was it like?  Was it emotional to leave the [U.S.] Marine Corps after twenty years?
Speaker 2:  	Very emotional.  There's a saying in the service, cause people, we always talk amongst each other, especially the senior enlisted people, like how do you know?  When do you know to give it up, 'cause you could stay thirty years, at least you could at the time.  Now you can stay thirty-three years or more.  But my friends and I talked and there's an old saying that, "You will know or they will know.  Hopefully you know first."  And I remember the day that I was selected to master gunnery sergeant, by now we have computers.  Everything is on the computer.  So I woke up early in the morning because I knew the list had come out for master gunnery sergeants and I knew that I was up for it before but I wasn't senior enough to get it 'cause I knew everybody in my field that was senior to me and they just want to get out the Marine Corps.  They stayed master gunnery sergeants for thirty years and they kind of clogged up the enlisted ranks of the senior enlisted ranks.  But you have to stay two years in any rank before you could retire at that rank.  So I remember waking up and looking at the list for master gunnery sergeants and I had a very, very good friend of mine, Curtis Brickshire [ph.] who served on recruit duty with me, we was overseas together in '83 [1983], '84 [1984].  We both made gunnery sergeant and master sergeant on the exact same day.  We were competitors on recruiting duty.  He recruited out of the city so he had a better pool of people, a larger pool of people to recruit.  I recruited in Joliet [Illinois].  But my numbers were just as good as his and we were very, very competitive against each other but ended up being friends.  So I'm going down the list and it's alphabetical and I get to the Bs before I get to the Gs.  So I got to Brickshire and I was just so happy that my good friend had made master gunnery sergeant, I stopped, picked up the phone and called him, woke him up at four o'clock in the morning.  I says, "Curtis you know you made master gunnery sergeant."  He was--thought he was dreaming.  And he says, "Okay, he said how did you do?"  I said, "I don't know."  I said, "Let me go back to the computer."  So I go back down to the computer and I get to the Gs and I see my name.  I says, "I made it too."  And he says, "What's your number," and I forgot what my number was, I want to say forty-two, very senior at the time out of all the master sergeants in the Marine Corps.  And his number was I think nineteen, 'cause he was senior to me as far as in his field, his particular field.  So we knew we was going to get promoted at the same day.  And that day we both made a promise to each other that we was going to stay a master gunnery sergeant for two years, we wasn't going to clog up the ranks like everybody else did and we was going to retire after two years.  And that was a pretty, pretty bold statement because after waiting all this time and finally making it to the highest rank, enlisted rank in the Marine Corps, I decided on day one that I wasn't going to stay a master gunnery but two years.  But Curtis and I made a deal with each other day that and two years later he retired I believe May 24th, I retired one June, retired within a week of each other.  So I knew it was time to go.  I knew I wanted to do something else.  I was still young at the time.  I was lucky enough to finish my college education.  I was an equal opportunity advisor which opened up a lot of doors for me for a civilian, employment whereas as a combat logistician, I probably could have found employment but it may not have been what I wanted to do.  So the timing was right. I had two years as a master gunnery sergeant and I was ready to move on.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2:  	So I was at peace with it.  It was still a difficult time to go through the retirement ceremony but I was at peace with it.  I knew that I could do something else other than the Marine Corps.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So this is 1997?
Speaker 2:  	This is 2001.
Speaker 1: Two thousand one [2001], okay.  Two thousand one [2001], all right.  So your promotion to master gunnery sergeant then was in--?
Speaker 2:  	Nineteen ninety-nine [1999].
Speaker 1: Nineteen ninety-nine [1999].
Speaker 2:  	In 1999 as--was said in an article was a whirlwind year for me.  I got promoted to master gunnery sergeant, I was lucky to receive the James Callendar Award [ph.] from the Montford Point Marine Association [Montford Point Marine Association, Inc.] for my work as a historian with the association.  I received the Roy Wilkins Award [Roy Wilkins Renown Service Award] from the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] and I graduated from college [Park College; Park University, Parkville, Maryland]; and all this happened within like ninety days.  So it was an incredible year in 1999 (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So--
Story_ID: 650677
Speaker 1: Where were you going to college?
Speaker 2:  	Park College, it's now Park University [Parkville, Maryland].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now you, there you made the national honor society for non-traditional students, right?  I think--
Speaker 2:  	Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: And there are other awards, you received the presidential award from Montford Point Marine Association [Montford Point Marine Association, Inc.] in '98 [1998] and the James Callendar Award [ph.] in '99 [1999].
Speaker 2:  	It was a good year.
Speaker 1: Right, okay.  So in, and also in '99 [1999], you received an award from the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], the Roy Wilkins Service Award [Roy Wilkins Renown Service Award]?
Speaker 2:  	And that one really shocked me because I knew exactly what that award was.  I knew many recipients of it and just didn't think I would ever be in that category because I was actually in Beaufort [South Carolina] aboard Parris Island [South Carolina] preparing for the spring council for the Montford Point Marine Association.  And somebody came up to me during all this preparation and says, "Hey Joe [HistoryMaker Joe Geeter, III], I just saw your name on a message.  You just won the NAACP Roy Wilkins Award."  And I was like, "Yeah, yeah, yeah, let me go back to work," because I was so busy providing logistical support for this association.  It didn't hit me 'til a couple of hours later.  I said, "Did he say I won that?"  I says, "Let me call up to the office and find out if he was pulling my leg or not," 'cause Marines have been known to pull each other's leg.  So when I called the office, I talked to the adjutant, Gunnery Sergeant Henderson [ph.] and she was, had been trying to find me for a couple of hours.  She says, "Joe, you're the 1999 award recipient," so that was kind of special, very special.
Story_ID: 650678
Speaker 1: What was your major at Park University [Park College; Park University, Parkville, Maryland]?
Speaker 2:  	Operational management, business management.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And when you graduated were you employed right away?
Speaker 2:  	No, I graduated in '99 [1999].  I was still an active duty Marine.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2:  	So I had two more years to be a Marine here.
Speaker 1: All right.  So, but after your tour was up in 2001, did you have a job lined up?
Speaker 2:  	No, I didn't and like most Marines that retired, I was concerned 'cause I had only known the [U.S.] Marine Corps for twenty-five years.  Although I thought I had talent, I knew I had finished my education, at least my bachelor's degree so I thought I was competitive but I did not have a job and I worked with a couple of recruiting agencies to find a job but they were all trying to guide me towards operational management, logistics, what I did for the Marine Corps.  But while I was equal opportunity advisor, I met a lady called, named Cynthia Golston [ph.] who told me one day that, "Joe [HistoryMaker Joe Geeter, III], you will be good in human resources," and I had never worked in human resources a day in my life.  But she kind of set me on a path to be interested in human resources.  So one of the recruiters or one of the head hunters I had knew of an opportunity with a propane company called AmeriGas [AmeriGas Propane, Inc.] that was beefing up their HR department and they were going to hire an employee relations representative which is at the lowest entry level for human resources.  So I interviewed for it over the phone and I came to Valley Forge for a second interview and I was made an offer.  Probably not what I wanted to make coming out the Marine Corps but I knew I had to get in the door.  All I wanted to do was get in the door of any company to show what I could do and I thought things would take care of themselves and it did because twelve years later I'm still with AmeriGas.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So is AmeriGas located in Valley Forge?
Speaker 2:  	Their headquarters is.  They have over twelve hundred locations in all fifty states but the corporate headquarters is in Valley Forge, Pennsylvania.
Speaker 1: And what office do you work out of?
Speaker 2:  	Human resources.  Again, I started off as an employee relations rep.  Within ninety days I was interviewing for a regional HR manager position.  I decided not to accept that position because it would required me to relocate to Richmond, Virginia and I had just got all my stuff in one place after twenty-five years in the Marine Corps, I wasn't ready to relocate six months later.  So I pretty much turned down a promotion at my first job which could have been the kiss of death really, but it wasn't.  It was just opened up for another opportunity because the person I was working with left the company and I was selected to be the corporate employee relations manager.  So that really helped me out.
Speaker 1: So what year was this?
Speaker 2:  	I started to work for AmeriGas in 2001, September 2001.  And I believe I received a promotion in March of 2002.
Story_ID: 650679
Speaker 1: How did you like it?  Was it, was it easy transition to civilian life or?
Speaker 2:  	For me it was and I was lucky because my last four or five years I served as a [U.S.] Marine Corps equal opportunity advisor which you have to have a more I guess humane side to you.  I wasn't barking orders or getting involved in real world or training situations in training Marines where you have to be very, very serious all the time.  So I kind of softened up my last couple of years.  I always joked.  If my Marines from the '70s [1970s] and '80s [1980s] saw me in 2001, it was two different people.  But I learned to be kinder, gentler, to understand people more.  [U.S.] Department of Defense, Equal Opportunity Management Institute [Defense Equal Opportunity Management Institute] really trained me for that.  Sixteen weeks of school will change anybody here, but it made me more sensitive to other folks and working with other folks.  I enjoyed working with folks and helping folks out.  So human resources was a natural progression I think and Cynthia Golston [ph.] saw that in me when I didn't see it in me, cause I had no idea that I would be working in HR [human resources].  And here I am, thirteen years, HR.  I work employee relations, I work labor relations.  I manage the, a couple of programs for the HR office and it's a good fit.  It's a great fit.
Speaker 1: Now do you work out of the Valley Forge [Pennsylvania] office?
Speaker 2:  	Yes, I do.  I'm headquartered out of Valley Forge, but I travel a lot for my company so; although my office is there, my office is really anywhere that AmeriGas [AmeriGas Propane, Inc.] has a location.
Story_ID: 650680
Speaker 1: Two thousand four [2004], you won the United Way award and you became Who's Who in 2006.  Two thousand five [2005], you were national president of the Montford Point Marine Association [Montford Point Marine Association, Inc.], national group (simultaneous).
Speaker 2:  	(Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: So tell us how that came about.
Speaker 2:  	In my wildest dreams I would not think I would be national president of the Montford Point Marine Association.  Back in 1992, I met an individual named Brooks Gray, master gunnery sergeant retired, Montford Point Marine.  He actually founded the association here in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] in 1965 and I was a gunnery sergeant when I met Brooks Gray.  And he met me and talked to me and kind of took a liking to me I guess and ended up being a mentor.  And Brooks told me a long time ago that, I remember his words.  He says, "Young man, one day you're going to lead this association."  And I looked at him like he was crazy 'cause I'm like, where did you get that from Brooks?  I'm just a regular old member out here in San Diego [California].  I'm not even an officer.  I've never held an office in this association.  He says, "You got something in you."  I said--think one day you're going to lead this association.  And when I left San Diego and went to Beaufort [Marine Corps Air Station Beaufort, Beaufort, South Carolina] for my third and final time I really got involved with the Montford Point Marine Association because the chapter president there was a good friend of mine.  He recruited me in the chapter.  I ended up being a chapter historian.  I ended up being almost like the go to guy with the chapter.  And Brooks Gray was forever looking after me.  He would call me periodically almost every week to tell me what to do, to guide me, to, just to encourage and mentor me.  And I held a variety of offices from the chapter to the national level.  I was national quartermaster.  Brooks Grey knew I was national quartermaster.  And I made national vice president.  But unfortunately, Brooks died in 2000, so he never got to see me make national president.  Brooks was the first national president of the association and I was the sixteenth.  So 2005, when I was elected president in Chicago [Illinois], I was pretty stunned.  I just had to absorb it all in that only ten years earlier I was a regular member.  Now I'm sitting in front of the body as the national president with all this responsibility.  So it's an incredible moment.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well how many chapters of the Montford Point Marine Association is it?
Speaker 2:  	Right now there's currently forty chapters.  I was national president from 2005 to 2009, and when I left, I believe we had thirty-six chapters.  During my administration we were responsible, me and my administration for starting I want to say four new chapters and revitalizing three other chapters.  So that was very important to me to keep this association going.  It had been going for a long time before me and I wanted to be the one to keep it going and move it a little bit more for it.  I had some big hopes for the Montford Point Marine Association.
Speaker 1: Now who can join?
Speaker 2:  	Anybody who served in any branch of the service honorably for ninety days, black, white, male, female, [U.S.] Air Force, [U.S.] Navy, as long as you serve--I believe when they first started in 1965, it was comprised of mainly Montford Point Marines.  But as they got older some of them started leaving us.  They realized if their legacy was going to continue on they had to kind of broaden their membership.  So almost anybody and I'm real proud to say that we've had chapter presidents in the Navy down in Macon, one at Robins [Robins Air Force Base] Macon, Georgia.  We're in the Army, female lead the Quantico 32 chapter [Quantico Chapter 32].  So we've come a long way from 1965.
Story_ID: 650681
Speaker 1: The organization has, I know I first became aware of the Tuskegee Airmen I guess in--
Speaker 2:  	Most folks do know about that (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) the late '70s [1970s].  You know I mean I had heard rumors about--I didn't meet any of them until the '70s [1970s].  They were set up at a community event, you know at a table, they were talking about their service, had some photos and that sort of thing.  What about Montford Point Marine Association [Montford Point Marine Association, Inc.], did it start right away right after--?
Speaker 2:  	No.  The Montford Point Marine Association actually started in 19-- September of 1965 here in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  It was about twenty years after World War II [WWII] was over with.  Brooks Gray was sitting around Philadelphia.  He was a salesman at the time and a Toastmaster [Toastmasters International], a gifted speaker, gifted orator.  And he wanted to get together with the old guys, simple as that.  He hadn't seen a lot of them since World War II so he planned a reunion and that's what it was at the time, a reunion at the old Adelphia hotel [Hotel Adelphia] in Philadelphia.  And you got to keep in mind this is 1965.  There are no text messages or Internet or cell phones.  To make a long distance phone call would cost you a fortune back then.  But somehow he got the word out all across the America that there was going to be a reunion of the Montford Point Marines.  And as I mentioned earlier about twenty thousand men went through Montford Point [Camp Gilbert H. Johnson, Jacksonville, North Carolina]. So he put the word out to see you know if you can get some of the old guys to come to Philadelphia, (background noise) four hundred people answered the call.  Four hundred people showed up at the Adelphia hotel.  It was an incredible reunion at the time.  They had a good time reminiscing about the good old days of World War II and most of them had found success in civilian life and a group of those men got together and said we have to do this again.  We have to do something to establish a group much like the American Legion, the Veterans of Foreign War [Veterans of Foreign Wars].  So they got together and actually wrote up bylaws that were incorporated into a charter that established the Montford Point Marine Association.  So the next year they had their first convention in 1966 in Chicago [Illinois].  And now we, we're celebrating or about to celebrate the forty-seventh annual convention in San Diego [California].
Story_ID: 650682
Speaker 1: What have been like the milestones in the history of the organization?
Speaker 2:  	One of the milestones--and they've had many milestones.  But recently as these men have gone old, gotten older and again some of them have left us, we wanted to try to perpetuate their legacy to preserve their legacy for all time.  So as national president I got a phone call one day from a guy named Rudy Carter [James "Rudy" Carter].  Rudy Carter--the Montford Point [Montford Point Marine Association, Inc.] has compared it selves to the Tuskegee Airmen and rightfully so because they endured some of the same hardships, they had some of the same combat successes that the Tuskegee Airmen held.  But not too many people knew about the Montford Point [Camp Gilbert H. Johnson, Jacksonville, North Carolina].  You could ask the average American they can tell you something about the Tuskegee Airmen or they can tell you something about the Buffalo Soldiers, but they could tell you nothing about the Montford Pointers.  So one day in 2007, President Bush, George Bush, H. Bush [sic.] I guess, not W. [President George Walker Bush], awarded the Congressional Gold Medal to the Tuskegee Airmen.  Well one of the members from Montford Point who witnessed that ceremony, it was happening I believe during the Super Bowl and he called me up.  I'm the national president.  And he says, "Mr. President, Tuskegee Airmen are getting a Congressional Gold Medal.  There they are again outshining us," 'cause they kind of compared themselves to us and he challenged me.  Rudy said, "What are you going to do about it?"  And I'm trying to watch the football game and I think I said something off the cuff that, "Hey Rudy I'm going to get the Congressional Gold Medal for the Montford Point Marines."  Pretty bold statement but I had no idea how I was going to do it.  I had no idea how I was going to get a ship named after Jimmie Howard neither.  So once I set my mind to something then I tried to get it done.  So I did a lot of research about the Congressional Gold Medal, what it took to get one awarded.  And I knew it took a lot of work and I knew that I could not do that work and be president of the association at the same time.  So I made a very conscious decision not to seek office for a third time.  I like to think I would have got reelected a third time but I decided to find somebody to either take my place or to lead this association while I went off and tried to get the Congressional Gold Medal.  So again, not knowing what to do, I went down to the Capitol [U.S. Capitol, Washington, D.C.] a few times just to talk to some congressional people and I was really floundering until I met a guy called State Senator Tony Hill, Anthony Hill [Anthony C. "Tony" Hill], out of the, I believe the 3rd district out of Florida [sic. Florida State Senate District 1].  I met him in 2007 at our national convention and told him my vision for the Congressional Gold Medal.  And he promptly told me that I was going about it wrong, that I had to first get support from the Congressional Black Caucus because if they don't support you, you're not going to get the rest of [U.S.] Congress to support you.  And he happened to know some members of the Congressional Black Caucus.  So at that next meeting he got me ten minutes, what was supposed to be ten minutes to address some members of the Congressional Black Caucus.  So I went down to D.C. [Washington, D.C.] with three or four original Montford Pointers.  I got to the podium just as nervous as I could possibly be, cause I'm looking out in the audience and I'm seeing people I see on TV and I see Senator Hill front and center saying, "Joe [HistoryMaker Joe Geeter, III], I know you can talk.  You need to sell.  I know you can sell.  I need you to sell these people on the Congressional Gold Medal."  So they gave me ten minutes, we took forty.  After forty minutes, I told the story about Montford Pointers.  I had some individual Montford Pointers come in and tell their story.  This event that I was at was hosted by U.S. Representative Corrine Brown from Florida.  She was very interested after we finished talking.  And she came up to me afterwards and says, "I want to help you."  So I knew we had legs at that time.  Whenever time you get a U.S. congressperson saying I want to help you, and she introduced me to her legislative assistant, Lee Footer, who was going to continue to be my guide to get me through the halls of Congress because I had no idea how to get through anything in Congress.  So Lee and I talked about it and he called me up maybe a few weeks later and says, "The representative is asking about the bill for the Congressional Gold Medal.  We're ready to receive it."  I says, "What bill?"  He says, "You got to write the bill."  And I says, "I got to write the bill?  I thought you guys wrote bills."  He says, "Oh no, you got--you're the originator.  You have to write the bill."  I never in my wildest dream thought I could write a bill for Congress.  So I went on the Internet.  I saw what the Tuskegee Airmen did and kind of mirrored the Montford Point bill after that.  He called me on a Friday.  I said, "When do you need this Lee?"  He's going to have a fit that I'm telling this story.  He says, "I need it Monday."  So I had three days to write a bill.  So I come down here to this basement and all this roughest material, put out everything 'cause I knew it had to be exactly right.  Because if it's wrong they're going to find any reason to put it to the shelf and go on to something else.  So I stayed up most of Friday night, most of Saturday night, Sunday I went to church and prayed on it, came back and finished the bill.  And by Monday I was ready. I thought it was ready.  I thought it looked good.  I went through fifteen, twenty revisions of it.  Nobody was here to proofread it for me.  It was mainly me upstairs at my computer.  And I gave it to Lee that Monday as promised.

Speaker 1: I didn't hear from Lee [Lee Footer] for several months.  It was just so much stuff going on in [U.S.] Congress.  It was always the budget, the healthcare; it was always something else going on more important than this little bill I wrote.  So finally he called me up and says, "We have time now.  We're going to put your bill in committee," which was a big deal to me because at that time they assigned a number to it.  And once they assign a number to a bill it's all over the Internet.  So it's a house resolution number and I forgot the number [H.R. 2447].  I really forgot the number now.  But once I had a number, now I can get that number out to my members and ask them to write their congresspeople to support this bill.  And in the meantime I was making trips down to Washington, D.C., to just walk up and down the Rayburn Building [Rayburn House Office Building, Washington, D.C.] and these other buildings just to see if I could find congresspeople out in the lobby and just grab them and give them some information about Montford Point and never thought I would be a lobbyist.  Didn't have a budget or anything like that.  All I had was a suitcase walking down the hall passing out information.  And for the most part I had a Montford Pointer with me.  That Montford Pointer was [HistoryMaker] Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Carpenter, who was a Montford Pointer.  He was a Washington, D.C. person.  He knew his way around.  He was still very ambulatory.  He could walk around very well so he stayed with me.  And it was some long days of walking around.  We was exhausted at the end of the day.  But if we made two or three contacts during that day we thought it was a good day.  And one day we was in the halls of Congress.  I had four Montford Pointers with me, Colonel Carpenter was one of them.  And when I was walking in, we was in the senate building [Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, D.C.] and Senator McCain [John McCain] came out of his office, he was in his shirt sleeves, they were rolled up like he was doing some work.  I'm sure he was.  And he kind of looked at me and saw I was in the uniform I'm in now and he saw the eagle, globe and anchor and my cover and my hat.  And he says, "What are you doing in the building here Marine?"  And I explained to him who I was.  I says, "I'm Joe Geeter [HistoryMaker Joe Geeter, III].  I'm the--," I think at the time I was still national president [of the Montford Point Marine Association, Inc.].  I said, "I'm here with some of the original Montford Pointers and we're here trying to get Congress to support legislation for a Congressional Gold Medal."  And Senator McCain kind of looked at me and you could tell his mind was thinking, he was kind of giving a nod and he says, "When that bill comes to the floor, it will be the easiest bill I vote for."  And here he is, Senator McCain's talking to me in the hallway and I just, I got a whole new sense of motivation at that time about you know this is a possibility, this may get done.  This very well may get done so that was almost the start of me having a very optimistic attitude as far as getting this bill done.  And we got it done.
Story_ID: 650684
Speaker 1: Give us the timetable for the congressional (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2:  	(Simultaneous) Okay, well the bill, again the first bill that we had kind of lavished [languished] in [U.S.] Congress because they had midterm elections in 2010 and [HistoryMaker] President Barack Obama said it best, the Democrats took a shellacking.  I lost most of my sponsors.  I had to start all over again.  I was discouraged.  But I--Corrine Brown got reelected thankfully and she told me don't give up hope we can still get this done but we have to start all over again.  So every signature that we had managed to get over the last three years was gone.  In the [U.S.] Senate, my main sponsor in the Senate was Senator Burris [HistoryMaker Roland Burris] out of Illinois who took President Obama's seat, he was gone. So I had no sponsors in the Senate, most of my sponsors in the House [U.S. House of Representatives] were gone.  But Corrine Brown stayed with me.  She says, "Joe [HistoryMaker Joe Geeter, III], we're going to get this done.  We are going to get this done."  So in the summer of 2011, we invited the commandant of the [U.S.] Marine Corps, John Amos--James Amos, I'm sorry, James Amos to our convention in Atlanta [Georgia] to be our guest speaker.  Well Atlanta's the home of CNN news.  We managed to get a few minutes on CNN news one morning during our convention and as you can imagine as they say it went viral.  America finally heard about these Montford Point Marines [Montford Point Marine Association, Inc.].  The commandant spoke out about the Montford Point Marines as the guest speaker at our national banquet that Saturday.  The next day he went out--or the next day, next couple of days he went out to San Diego [California] for another convention and spoke about the Montford Point Marines again.  Now the AP [Associated Press] picked it up so now we got CNN and the press picked it up so this thing took off like a rocket.  The commandant of the Marine Corps now wants to host a breakfast.  This was in July of 2011.  In August of 2011, the commandant invited 135 Montford Pointers to D.C. [Washington, D.C.], for a special parade and the whole idea of this parade was to give more media coverage to these Montford Point Marines.  In September 2011, the commandant of the Marine Corps invited the Congressional Black Caucus to his home for breakfast to continue to lobby for the bill.  Corrine Brown attended that breakfast.  She was absolutely re-motivated to get this bill done.  She saw how Marines did things, she saw how the commandant of the Marine Corps was behind it.  She had met a number of Montford Pointers and she was very, very motivated to get it done.  So at the Congressional Black Caucus that September she looked me dead in the eye and she says, "Joe, I'm going to get this done for the Marine Corps birthday and my birthday."  Her birthday is November 11th, Veterans Day.  And I was a little optimistic because I had been through the 111th Congress already and I'd been disappointed.  And although I knew we was closer than we've ever been I didn't want to celebrate prematurely.  But she did it.  She--you got--you need a super majority, 290 out of 435 members of Congress have to sign their name on a piece of paper saying they support this bill before it gets to the floor.  And then you have to vote on it when it gets to the floor.
Story_ID: 650685
Speaker 1: When she [Corrine Brown] got to the floor in late October 2011, I believe it's October 25th, I remember being in Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania] for business for work and I got the phone call that C-Span was going to televise it, the vote.  So I'm racing home to get to the vote.  I raced right here to this room here, turn on the TV, I called the then national president, Dr. James Averhart [James T. Averhart, Jr.] and says, "They're about to vote."  So we're on the phone together watching the vote.  And they voted electronically so the speaker opens up the floor for voting, usually have about five minutes to cast your vote.  You press a button, yay, nay or abstain.  And they have the big board up there like a score board Democrat, Republican, how they vote.  So the voting started and at first it was, it started off kind of slow, twenty to nothing, thirty to nothing, all yes votes, fifty to nothing, a hundred to nothing.  So I'm starting to get excited.  It's like me again I said it before, like me watching the Super Bowl when my favorite team is playing and the guy is running for a touchdown.  And so it got to about a hundred votes to nothing, a hundred yes votes, no no votes, somebody voted no.  And I remember on the phone and I'm like yelling and screaming at the phone and at the TV like, "Who would vote against this legislation," you know?  And I'm thinking I have some kind of power like who wants to end their political career 'cause whoever vote us no, I'm going to make it my personal business to make sure they know they voted no for this bill.  And then it was about 120 to 1, and all of a sudden the no vote switched over to a yes vote.  So I figured either this person thought that they didn't want to be the only person that voted against this legislation or maybe they pushed the wrong button.  So it's about 120 to nothing, 150 to nothing, 190 to nothing, 200 to nothing, so I figured we're going to get to 290 and I'll be glad when we get to this 290 point.  We got to about 270 to nothing and then again the national president is on the phone with me all that time and we're talking and we're--because the national president has been lobbing with me.  I taught him how to get down and lobby down in D.C. [Washington, D.C.] like I'm a teacher now, how to mix with these people and how to be patient with these people 'cause they have something we want, their vote.  And it went from 270 to nothing, it jumped to 300 to nothing and so I'm celebrating 'cause I knew we got the House [U.S. House of Representatives].  And he said, "Slow down, they're still voting," 320 to nothing, 350 to nothing, 400 to nothing.  The final vote was 422 to nothing.  It was probably the most bipartisan piece of legislation this [U.S.] Congress has ever passed.  But I knew we wasn't done yet.  Although we did celebrate, I did celebrate that night, I knew we had to get through the [U.S.] Senate and I knew I lost my main support in the Senate with Senator Burris [HistoryMaker Roland Burris].  But Senator Kay Hagan out of North Carolina where Montford Point [Camp Gilbert H. Johnson, Jacksonville, North Carolina] was decided to be the main sponsor of the bill.  And Senator Hagan knew the importance of trying to get this bill passed for the [U.S.] Marine Corps birthday which is November 10th.  So the Senate went in session to vote on November 9th.  It wasn't on C-Span so I was waiting by the phone and from what I heard Senator Hagan kept them on the floor past the dinner hour to make sure they voted on this legislation before they broke for the day or for the night or for the week.  So when the Senate found out that the House voted 422 to nothing, I was told that they can vote by affirmation.  In other words, "All in favor say aye," instead of going through that voting process.  And so technically they wrote it down at 67 to nothing because two thirds of 100 Senators is 67 to nothing.  So it made it through the Senate on November 9th so that was probably the best Marine Corps birthday present I could ever imagine.
Story_ID: 650686
Speaker 1: But now comes the hard part: the president of the United States [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama] still has to sign the bill.  And I was told that the president has to sign the bill within ten days of the [U.S.] Senate voting or else it's almost like a pocket veto.  He does nothing when it goes away.  The president was out at, not only out of town he was out of the country at the time so he wasn't available to sign the bill.  And I was led to believe there was another provision if the president was out of the country when he comes back to the country now he has five days to sign the bill into law.  Well he came back the Sunday before Thanksgiving so five days is that Friday.  We know he's not going to sign the bill on Thanksgiving.  He's probably not going to sign the bill the day after Thanksgiving.  So we figured the opportunity, the window of opportunity was Monday, Tuesday or Wednesday.  And I wanted to be down there when he signed it 'cause everybody wants to, their aha moment when you're standing behind the president and he takes that pen in his left hand and signs the bill.  Unfortunately, that phone call never came.  When the president came back there was a number of bills, legislation that required his signature so he kind of unceremoniously signed many bills into law that Wednesday and the Montford Point gold medal was one of those bills.  So although we didn't get our aha moment with the president, I knew at that time on November 23rd that these men were going to get the Congressional Gold Medal.  Now keep in mind the four years previously I, I'm telling these Montford Pointers, "Give me a copy of your discharge.  I'm going to get the gold medal, it's going to happen."  19,168 men went through Montford Point [Camp Gilbert H. Johnson, Jacksonville, North Carolina].  I had forty discharge papers.  So nobody really, I don't know if they were skeptical or they didn't believe that we was going to get it done.  But once we got it done it hit the newspapers, USA Today, front of the newspaper, hit all the news agencies, CBS news with Diane Sawyer [sic. 'ABC World News'; 'World News Tonight'].  I mean this thing actually blew up.  The [U.S.] Marine Corps sent out a press release, "Calling all Montford Pointers, get your discharge papers in.  Send them to," and I didn't know they did this, "send them to Joe Geeter [HistoryMaker Joe Geeter, III] at 27 Red Tail Court [Limerick, Pennsylvania]," and my phone number.  My phone blew up.  I was getting eighty, ninety, a hundred phone calls a day.  My mail was like this (indicates height) every day, coming in there.  I had no idea of what I started.  So I worked with just a few people from January of 2012 to April 2012, trying to document all this stuff coming in, trying to talk to all these families, explaining to them what I need in order for them to receive a replica Congressional Gold Medal.  It wore me out.  For four months I was, I lived in my bedroom when I wasn't at work, just doing this work, getting two or three hours sleep a night.  Finally the national president [James T. Averhart, Jr.] realized that I couldn't do it all so he drove up here to get all my files from me to take them down to the Pentagon [Washington, D.C.] and that was a bittersweet day when I saw him drive off with five years of my work in the trunk of his car, hoping he wouldn't get into an accident.  But he took it down to the Pentagon who had set up a war room to receive all this information.  They put a Marine Corps colonel, Stephanie Smith in charge of it.  She had a couple of lieutenants and a couple of other people working at it night and day.  It wore them out.  They was wondering how I did it by myself for four months when they couldn't, five of them couldn't do it in the Pentagon in three months.  But it was well worth it.  We made contact with well over a thousand families.  And on 27 June 2012, four hundred living Montford Pointers descended on the U.S. Capitol [Washington, D.C.] at the visitors center, and was awarded the Congressional Gold Medal.  It was a great day.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1:  	Best day of my life.
Story_ID: 650687
Speaker 1: So we, we've interviewed General Willie Williams [HistoryMaker Lieutenant General Willie Williams] and some of the others that were (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2:  	(Simultaneous) Willie Williams is the chief of staff and a commandant, yeah.  He did a lot to move it forward after the Montford Point Marine Association [Montford Point Marine Association, Inc.] got it started.  So he took the ball across the goal line, him and Colonel Smith [Stephanie Smith].
Speaker 1: Okay.  And Joseph Carpenter [HistoryMaker Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Carpenter], he gave his story of what happened to him. You know we interviewed him.
Speaker 2:  	Colonel Carpenter was incredible.  He was the--a lot of Montford Pointers throughout the years of me lobbying for this gold medal [Congressional Gold Member] went with me to Capitol Hill [Washington, D.C.].  Colonel Carpenter went with me almost every time.  I can't think of a time, I mean he's been to more receptions, more lobbying things, Congressional Black Caucus.  I mean this guy is eighty-seven, eighty-eighty years old.  But if I call him and say "I'm coming down to D.C. [Washington, D.C.]," we had a set routine.  I would meet him at Bolling Air Force Base [Joint Base Anacostia-Bolling, Washington, D.C.] where I would secure a room on the cheap, it's thirty-five, forty bucks [dollars] a night 'cause I didn't have a budget again.  He would come on base because he had his sticker because he was a retired Marine [U.S. Marine Corps].  He would meet me at the gas station, I would jump in his car, we would drive to the Capitol [U.S. Capitol, Washington, D.C.] and we would spend most of the day there just walking up and down the halls.  Sometimes, I remember one time in particular I had four Montford Pointers with me, Colonel Carpenter, Mr. Ferguson [ph.], First Sergeant Kidd [George Kidd] and I forgot the fourth one, Mel somebody [ph.], I've forgotten Mel's last name.  But First Sergeant Kidd was tiring.  He really had some legs--a leg problem and he couldn't really walk the halls but I really needed a Montford Pointer to get with me and we couldn't find a wheelchair anywhere in the halls of [U.S.] Congress.  So I saw a utility room close by and I opened up the door and there was a dolly in there, those long dollies that maintenance people use.  So I put George Kidd, First Sergeant Kidd on top of that dolly. I pulled him up the hallways and somebody took a picture of that, of me just pulling this guy up the hallways.  It was pretty funny 'cause I was determined that he was going to be with me.  I didn't want to leave him, didn't want to take him back to the car.  So we kind of borrowed a dolly from the U.S. Senate and kind of pulled him up the hallways on that.  It was a pretty cool moment.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now this is a hand cart dolly or--?
Speaker 2:  	A hand cart dolly.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2:  	And he was standing on there like he was on a chariot in Rome [Italy].  It just looked so--and people were looking at him like what the heck are these Marines doing in the congressional halls with a dolly?  So, but was pretty cool.
Story_ID: 650688
Speaker 1: Now was AmeriGas [AmeriGas Propane, Inc.] pretty understanding?  This, it takes a lot of time and energy?
Speaker 2:  	It does; and before I even ran for national vice president, I got with my boss who was the director of human resources and I pretty much asked his permission.  I said, "Don [Don Proctor], you know the members have asked me to seek the national vice presidency of this association [Montford Point Marine Association, Inc.] and I just want to know how that, you know, how that lies with you?  It's not going to affect my job, at least I don't think it is.  Because I give AmeriGas 110 percent."  But he was supportive.  Don was very, very supportive and because I travel a lot for my company, coincidentally a lot of cities that I traveled to have a Montford Point chapter there.  So I was able to take care of Montford Point business and AmeriGas business while still doing my job.
Story_ID: 650689
Speaker 1: Since that time, you received personal decorations; and then your Meritorious Service Medal, the Navy and Marine Corps Commendation Medal, the Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medal with three gold stars.  And the--you know the other awards, the Marine Corps Good Conduct Medal, you got, I guess you had that when you retired.  But when you look back at everything you've done to this point, what today would you say is your legacy in the [U.S.] Marine Corps?
Speaker 2:  	In the Marine Corps?
Speaker 1: Or as a--yeah.
Speaker 2:  	It's got to be the Congressional Gold Medal.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2:  	I mean Jimmie Howard and that ship [USS Howard DDG 83] was a big deal but that didn't affect as many families as this Congressional Gold Medal.  Again it was 19,168 men that went through [Camp Gilbert H. Johnson, Jacksonville, North Carolina] and they all had families.  So even though the majority of them are dead, a lot of their family members are still living and I've gotten so many phone calls that, from so many families that did not know that their dad or their grandfather or their uncle or their husband was a Montford Point Marine.  But now they can proudly say that my family member is a Congressional Gold Medal recipient, the same medal that [President] George Washington got, the same medal that President Clinton [President William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton] got, the same medal that Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] got.  They're in that category now.  So that's going to go on and no.  And out of that nineteen thousand, we've only made contact with less than two thousand.  So this is just starting.  There are still a lot of families out there that don't even know that their family member was a Montford Point Marine because he may have deceased in the '50s [1950s] or '60s [1960s], or twenty or thirty years ago and they haven't made the connection yet.
Story_ID: 650690
Speaker 1: Now you're still working for AmeriGas [AmeriGas Propane, Inc.]--
Speaker 2:  	Yes I am (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) right now.  Okay.
Speaker 2:  	Yes I am.
Speaker 1: So is retirement close or--?
Speaker 2:  	Wish it was closer.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2:  	I'm still a young man but I plan to retire right at sixty-two, so I'll be fifty-five in September.  So I probably got seven more years of work ahead of me.
Speaker 1: And your current title is--?
Speaker 2:  	I'm the corporate employee relations manager.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now any stories about this job in terms of--you've been at this for quite a while now?
Speaker 2:  	Well again, as I said earlier I had never worked in HR [human resources] before, but I knew that AmeriGas has purchased another propane company called Columbia Propane [Columbia Propane Corporation].  At the time AmeriGas had I want to say thirty-six hundred employees and Columbia Propane had twelve hundred.  So I knew they was expanding HR so I knew they needed somebody in there.  So I was given a phone interview at first and they asked all the questions you asked during the interview and it got to the point--and I was being interviewed by Don Proctor, the director who ended up being my boss.  I was asked at one point what questions did I have and one of the questions I had to Don was, how long do you think the successful candidate would have before they fully know this job?  What's the learning curve of this job?  And he says, "Well I expect somebody to be fully up and running in eighteen months."  And I remember I started laughing, I didn't mean to laugh, I just laughed.  And he asked me, he says "What you laughing at?"  I said, "Well in the [U.S.] Marine Corps, you can wake up one day, be the supply officer and wake up the next day and be the ammo officer.  All they do is give you a book."  I said, "Eighteen months, I could fly the space shuttle," and then he started laughing.  And I think I peaked his curiosity because he called me back for an in house interview and then when I came to Valley Forge [Pennsylvania] it was three candidates left, me and two others.  So we were all in the building at the same time and they're sizing me up and I'm sizing them up.  And I remember speaking to my brother [David Geeter] that night and telling him about the whole experience.  He says, "Joe [HistoryMaker Joe Geeter, III], once they meet you, you're going to get the job," and the next day I got a call with an offer, so it worked out pretty cool.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now how has the Marine Corps experience influenced your work with AmeriGas?
Speaker 2:  	The Marine Corps experience--
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2:  	Can you ask the question again please?
Speaker 1: Yeah, I just wanted to ask you how the Marine Corps experience influenced your work at AmeriGas?
Speaker 2:  	How it influenced my work?  Well the discipline helps.  Any position you're at you got to have some discipline.  The school that I went to for equal opportunity [Defense Equal Opportunity Management Institute] allows me to accept different peoples for different, you know for who they are.  So in the corporate environment you work with people from all walks of life.  And I accept everybody for who they are and what they can do.  I think the Marine Corps helped tremendously.  I got a lot of patience now too, didn't have patience when I was a young man.  But I think it's helped out tremendously.  And AmeriGas has been very, very good to me as far as allowing me to be involved in Montford Point [Montford Point Marine Association, Inc.].  I do a lot of other things for AmeriGas.  I raise a lot of money for United Way [United Way Worldwide] through AmeriGas so that's gotten my name on a few spotlights.  So I'm allowed to do probably a little bit more than the average employee, corporate employee relations manager can do because of the attention I've gotten for the money I've raised for United Way so that's helped out.  But my Marine Corps experience and my college experience at Park College, now Park University [Parkville, Maryland], has prepared me well for my second career.
Story_ID: 650691
Speaker 1: You were saying at some point and I didn't ask you about it in detail, but a documentary was made about the Montford Point Marines and narrated by Lou Gossett [HistoryMaker Louis Cameron Gossett, Jr.] and was it Avery Brooks or--?
Speaker 2:  	No, it was Lou Gossett.
Speaker 1: Lou Gossett.
Speaker 2:  	Lou Gossett, actually that was the second major documentary.  One was done in 1997, didn't get a lot of fanfare.  It was really distributed kind of just within the [U.S.] Marine Corps community.  But as national vice president [of the Montford Point Marine Association, Inc.], the national president, Nathaniel James, my predecessor and others in the D.C. chapter [Washington, D.C.], lobbied to [U.S.] Congress for money to make a documentary film about Montford Point [Camp Gilbert H. Johnson, Jacksonville, North Carolina].  Well U.S. Representative James Clyburn [HistoryMaker James Clyburn] and Senator Lindsey Graham were instrumental in allocating five hundred thousand dollars for the Montford Point Marines to make a documentary film.  So we partnered with the University of North Carolina in Wilmington [University of North Carolina at Wilmington, Wilmington, North Carolina] and South Carolina State University [Orangeburg, South Carolina], their film departments and their respective historians to produce a documentary film in 2007 called 'The Right to Fight: the Story of the Montford Point Marines' [sic. 'Marines of Montford Point: Fighting for Freedom'].  And that movie was narrated, the voice over was done by Lou Gossett who we know received his Academy Award [Oscar] for portraying a Marine drill instructor in 'An Officer and a Gentleman.'  So it's a perfect fit.  And Lou Gossett's name and his voice really gave us instant credibility so unlike that film that was done in 1997 where the voice was done by a good voice, but an obscure voice.  But when you hear Lou Gossett's voice and you see his face on a documentary, it kind of makes you say hey, this is important.  Let me listen to this or let me watch this.  So that movie premiered in 2006.  I was at the premiere at the University of North Carolina in Wilmington.  We actually had a pre-showing of that at the first national convention that I attended as national president so I was feeling pretty good about the first couple of months of my presidency when I got the opportunity to host Lou Gossett and this film, to let the men know the Montford Pointers that we was on our way to preserving their legacy.  And that movie really went a long way to help us preserve their legacy because it was released in November of 2007 to eighty-seven PBS [Public Broadcasting Service] stations across the United States.  So it was shown in November during Veterans Day and it was shown a lot during February during Black History Month.  So a lot of Americans got a chance to learn about Montford Point through their PBS station so it was just another case of us getting the word out about these heroes and starting to prepare the congress for what I would end up lobbying for because it's one thing when you go in very cold but it's one--another thing when you go in and say, hey Montford Point, maybe I heard of that before.  Did you guys have a movie?  And I must have got that a couple of dozen times and I said yes, it was on PBS and Lou Gossett--oh I saw that.  That was pretty good.  And then I could follow up and put something in their hand about Montford Point at the same time and ask for their support for the gold medal.  So the movie really kick started me and my efforts for the Congressional Gold Medal.
Story_ID: 650692
Speaker 1: Now, well, again if you look back at everything you've done to this point is there anything that you regret or would go back and change if you could?
Speaker 2:  	In my entire life or just the [U.S.] Marine Corps (laughter)?
Speaker 1: Well let's do the entire life, yeah, so--?
Speaker 2:  	Wish I wouldn't have got into that fight in boot camp, probably so.  I mean in retrospect I probably wish I wouldn't have got--wish I would have had a little bit more discipline and graduated with my platoon and--but things would have turned out different.  And I believe I have a lot of faith, I believe in God.  Everything happens for a reason, you know.  What if I didn't get into that fight, would that have changed my orders?  You know what if I did get orders back to California [Marine Corps Recruit Depot San Diego, San Diego, California] instead of to Beaufort [Marine Corps Air Station Beaufort, Beaufort, South Carolina], would I have been involved in Montford Point?  I would have been in California you know going after the woman I was in love with at the time.  But instead I went to Beaufort and I met Elijah Abram and who put me really in contact with the Montford Point Marine Association [Montford Point Marine Association, Inc.].  So no there's no regrets--everything happens for a reason.  You can't judge your fate or your destiny; and this is my fate, this is my destiny.

Speaker 2:  	Oh, the Montford Point [Montford Point Marine Association, Inc.]--I'm most comfortable when I have Montford Pointers with me and as you know I have a few with me today because why I can articulate and I can tell the stories about the Montford Pointers.  In the end, people want to see what a Montford Pointer is.  I did not go through Montford Point [Camp Gilbert H. Johnson, Jacksonville, North Carolina], but these men did and it's so few of them left.  Out of the 19,168 or 800--19,866, depends on what book you read, about twenty thousand men went through Montford Point.  We probably only have maybe five hundred living and that's a small number. So while they're still living, while they're still able to tell their stories, I want them to get all the glory, all the attention that they did not get for sixty years prior to this gold medal [Congressional Gold Medal].
Speaker 1: Okay.  So we owe a debt of gratitude to Mr. Snowten [Lucius Horace Snowten] and Mr. Turner [Thomas S. Turner, Sr.] who are here today.
Speaker 2:  	Oh absolutely.  I wish, I had a third person coming too, Phil Herout [Phillip Herout].  Phil just got released from the hospital yesterday and he was trying his heart out to get here to the point where I didn't think it was good for his health to be out and neither did his wife.  So Phil's mad at me right now but I think he'll, I think I'll--he'll get over it.  But Phil has been with me for the entire time I've been in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  You never, don't like to have favorites but Phil, when I call him to go somewhere to speak, just like some of these gentlemen here today, they say, "What time and where do you want me?"  Because again I can talk all day about Montford Point but they want to interact, they want to take pictures, they want a Montford Pointer to sign their program; and Phil, Mr. Snowten, Mr. Turner and others have always been there for me, so.

Speaker 1: I know they--though they've been like, there've been soldiers here today, they, they're probably are glad that I have one last question.
Speaker 2:  	Okay.
Speaker 1: But is there anything we haven't talked about before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2:  	Probably my immediate family.  I know in the beginning we talked about them but my sister [Felicia Geeter] and my brother [David Geeter] have been by far my biggest supporters.  My brother, one of the reasons why I accepted this position is 'cause my brother lives eighty miles from me.  My mother [Elma Geeter] lives ninety-five miles here.  My sister she lives in Chicago [Illinois] but my brother is my best friend.  He knows what I'm doing with Montford Point [Montford Point Marine Association, Inc.] and as many times that I've missed some family events, my mother's birthday because I'm giving a speech in Williamsport, Pennsylvania, so my mother's been very understanding of my career in the [U.S.] Marine Corps and my passion for Montford Point.  And my sister is probably my biggest fan in Chicago.  She is just so proud of her little brother.  I don't believe I said that on film, but her little brother and what I've accomplished.  She's always bragging about me and she really understands my passion and why I do this for the Montford Pointers because it's an incredible story.  If you sit down and you talk to these gentleman just one time and realize what they went through, they've got every reason in the world to be bitter, to be angry but they're not.  They just wanted to serve their country, it's just as simple as that.  They just wanted the recognition of every other Marine that got--they wanted to wear the uniform, they wanted to go overseas, they wanted to fight for their country, they wanted to be respected.  What the heck is wrong with that?  But they didn't get that.  They got disrespected.  They got talked about.  They got kicked, they got everything from the commandant of the [U.S.] Marine Corps at the time to the citizens out in town that didn't believe they were Marines when they was wearing the uniform.  They thought they were impersonating the Marines.  But they endured all that and I'm just so glad some of them are still with us today for the glory part of it.

Speaker 1: Well sir, the last question is similar to legacy but a little bit more personal.  Sir, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2:  	That I did the best I could for my fellow man and my fellow Marines [U.S. Marine Corps].  That I worked hard for 'em, I looked out for their interests and I was lucky.  I had a lot of good mentors, a lot of good mentors that took their time to make sure that I stayed on that path because I said, as I say growing up, I could have ended up on a different path easily, very easily.  Many of my friends are in jail right now doing long terms.  I could have been there.  One in particular and I won't say his name, but I got a letter from him upstairs right now, one of my best friends growing up.  He ended up doing a terrible crime in Chicago [Illinois] that him and his brother got life for.  This guy literally saved my life growing up in the streets of Chicago.  Somebody wanted to do some harm to me and he came up from behind him and stopped him from doing it.  And if he wouldn't have done that I wouldn't be sitting here right now.  So I know exactly where I am in my life and why I'm here and it's to help other people; and that's what I try to do.
Speaker 1: Okay, well that's--well thank you for sharing with us.
Speaker 2:  	All right.  Thanks a lot guys.

Speaker 1: Well the first photo we're looking at is a picture of the Academy Award [Oscar] actor, Lou Gossett [HistoryMaker Louis Cameron Gossett, Jr.] and myself as national president.  I believe it was taken in July of 2007 in Jacksonville, North Carolina and that's when we premiered the documentary film, the Montford Point Marines ['Marines of Montford Point: Fighting for Freedom'].
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Could you get some of the dust--?
Speaker 1:  	Oh yeah, that thing is dusty.  So there should be a dust thing right behind you on the--
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  That will be (unclear).
Speaker 2:  	Well if you could Photoshop that ear piece out of my ear.  I can't believe I got that ear piece in my ear.
Speaker 1: That's all right.  This is 2013.
Speaker 2:  	I didn't talk about that one yet.  The John Amos picture.
Speaker 1: Oh with John Amos, I'm sorry.
Speaker 2:  	Yeah.
Speaker 1: I move too fast.
Speaker 2:  	All right.  Okay, this picture was taken at our national convention in Atlanta [Georgia] in July of 2011, and that's with the actor John Amos who is very much a Montford Point Marine supporter [Montford Point Marine Association, Inc.]. So he was receiving an award, a special president's award for his work on the documentary film about the Montford Point Marines.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2:  	Wow, got a little red eye there.  That picture I'm just guessing 'cause I've got many pictures with Kweisi Mfume.  I believe that picture was taken at the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] convention in Baltimore, Maryland in July of 2000.
Speaker 1: That's my mother [Elma Geeter].  My mother was twice my date at the Marine Corps ball.  Because I've got master gunnery chevrons on that has to be 1999 or 2000.  I believe it was 1999.  That same year I graduated from college [Park College; Park University, Parkville, Maryland] and had those other awards.  That was a big year.  Forgot my mom was there.
Speaker 2: That's Joe Geeter.  That's my dad, that's Joe Geeter, Jr. at his piano.  He was a very good piano player, piano's still in my family too.  It's at my brother's house.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Who is this?
Speaker 2:  	That's me.  That looks like an official picture that was taken in my Charlie uniform which is the Marine Corps summer uniform.  And I'm guessing, I'm looking at the ribbons, that's probably around 2000, around 2000.
Speaker 1: Oh, that's when I was a heavyweight there.  That picture was taken about a year after I retired, probably 2001, 2002 at a Marine Corps ball.  Same picture there.
Speaker 2: Whoa no, let's not put that picture in there.  Or any pictures with any females, no, no.  Let's (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) (Unclear)?
Speaker 2:  	No, 'cause no matter what, somebody's going to be upset.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2:  	Every ball I probably had a different date.
Speaker 1: (Unclear).
Speaker 2:  	Yeah, I know okay.  Let's not any females, you put one in there, thirty going to be mad so let's not add none of them in there.
Speaker 1: (Unclear).
Speaker 2:  	Yeah, exactly.  Whew lord, that was a bad hair day there.  That was a picture I took in preparation for promotion to master gunnery sergeant and that's probably 1998.
Speaker 1: Now we're going back there.  That is a boot camp picture, December 1976.
Speaker 2: And that's a--oh no, that's a good--that was my last official picture in the [U.S.] Marine Corps as a master gunnery sergeant.  So that was, yeah my last picture.
Speaker 1: The Marine Corps has some decent photographers too (unclear).
Speaker 2:  	Yeah.  That was one of the field pictures I took as a, I believe a master sergeant.  Oh, that's too many pictures of me.  I don't want all them pictures in there.  What else, let's get through some of those things and--
Speaker 1: (Unclear) here? Let's go back to the, go way back to you when--
Speaker 2:  	Okay that's, oh that's a young guy there.  Oh, that was the passport picture.  I remember when I took that.  I took that in 1983 so I could get a passport to go to the Philippines.
Speaker 1: Wow, what am I a corporal?  I took that in 1978 so I could get a passport to go to the Philippines.  That's insane that it was back to back like that but I remember that picture here.
Speaker 2: Sergeant--
Speaker 1:  	Ah, that's when I was in Okinawa [Okinawa Island, Japan] when I was the plans and deployment unit chief.  That was probably 1990.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Look like Sergeant Huff [ph.] here.
Speaker 1:  	Yeah.  That's one of my favorite pictures there.  That's actually my grandfather's 1957 Chevy [Chevrolet], that's my brother, my sister, and my first cousin, that's Felicia Geeter, David Geeter and Daniel Gibson [ph.].
Speaker 2: And that's at my sister's first Holy Communion.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Anybody tell you before that you favor Sergeant Huff?
Speaker 2:  	Sergeant Huff, I know he had that high voice.  That's my brother and my sister when I still believed in Santa Claus.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  A lovely lady.
Speaker 2:  	Up until last year, somebody told me there was no such thing as Santa Claus.  I hate that picture but my mother's in it.  That's my mother, my brother, my sister, that's us on Easter Sunday.  I would imagine I think I'm four years old or four or five years old so that was probably 1962.
Speaker 1: And I said my dad could sell anything and he could.  That's him selling pots and pans.
Speaker 2: Whew lord, that was right before I got that Marine Corps haircut.  My Afro was at, it was up to fourteen inches, I measured it.
Speaker 1: Was it?
Speaker 2:  	Yeah.
Speaker 1: That's one of the biggest ones I've seen.
Speaker 2:  	Whew lord, I had an Afro here.
Speaker 1: I just couldn't get a complete Afro.  Mine started sinking.
Speaker 2:  	I wish I knew when that was taken but that was after I retired.  I just don't know where or when.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Well we got that.  Let's see. (Unclear).
Speaker 2:  	Yeah, those are official.  I just grabbed that folder, so--
Speaker 1: Yeah, here's another date here, you don't want those.
Speaker 2:  	Well Kim [ph.] that was one I should have went back to California for but thank god--
Speaker 1: This one here?
Speaker 2:  	Yeah, that's the one I was (unclear).
Speaker 1: Would she make the rest of them mad?
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Okay, we're still rolling. Yeah, all right.
Speaker 1:  	Nah.
Speaker 2: Oh, okay.
Speaker 1:  	Her husband may not like that.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  We're recording all of this.
Speaker 1:  	But that was long after I dated her.
Speaker 2: I understand.  So (unclear).
Speaker 1:  	Ah yeah, that one right there is a good one.  Ooh, I don't believe I even brought that picture down there.  But I was the last of my siblings to graduate from college.  That's my mother, my brother and my sister who came down to witness that ceremony.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  It makes you smile too.
Speaker 2:  	Yeah, it does.  Anybody ever mentions this picture here I will kill you.
Speaker 1: Oh my goodness.
Speaker 2:  	(Laughter) That's me having a bubble bath.  Okay, you got a shadow in there.  You got a shadow in there, sorry.
Speaker 1: It's the (unclear)?
Speaker 2:  	That's (makes sound), if you want to start from the beginning I figure you got to have the, a picture of me naked.
Speaker 1: You got to have a baby picture.
Speaker 2:  	You gotta have a baby picture.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right. (Audio disturbance) Thanks a lot.
