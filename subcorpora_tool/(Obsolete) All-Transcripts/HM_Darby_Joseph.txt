Speaker 1: I'm Denise Gines, the interviewer for The HistoryMakers. Matthew Hickey is the videographer.  Would you please spell your name--state your name and spell your name, including your middle name?
Speaker 2: My full name is Joseph Anthom Darby [HistoryMaker Reverend Joseph Darby], first name, J-O-S-E-P-H, middle name A-N-T-H-O-M, last name, Darby, D-A-R-B-Y.
Speaker 1: And what is your date of birth, please?
Speaker 2: Date of birth, August 7th, 1951.
Speaker 1: And your place of birth?
Speaker 2: Columbia, South Carolina.
Speaker 1: And what is your occupation?
Speaker 2: Senior pastor at Morris Brown African Methodist Episcopal Church, Charleston, South Carolina.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what is the location of this interview?
Speaker 2: That's still in Charleston, South Carolina.
Speaker 1: Okay, and today's date?
Speaker 2: Today's date is February 3rd, 2007.
Story_ID: 571797
Speaker 1: We're going to start with what I call People magazine-ish type questions.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Okay.
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: My favorite color is probably blue.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's nice and calming and sedate, so, I guess that's my favorite color.
Speaker 1: Okay, and do you have a favorite food?  What do you like to eat?
Speaker 2: Oh, that's a very long list.  I don't know if I have a favorite.  I can't identify anything.  My wife [Mary Bright Darby] usually says, whatever's in my line of sight at a given moment, so, I guess that's my favorite.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: My favorite time of the year is actually winter.  I'm very fond of cold weather.  My late mother [Eloise Janerette Darby] used to have a wonderful expression that winter's better because you can always wrap up in the winter, you cannot strip down to match summer in South Carolina.  So, I like winter.  I think it's a good time of year for reflection.
Speaker 1: Okay.  When thinking about vacation, do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Some place near the water.  I'm blessed now to be able to live in a place [Charleston, South Carolina] near the water so that, that's a luxury for me but I like natural grandeur as a kicker for vacations, so, some place where there's a nice ocean to look at, some place where there's nice mountains to kind of get lost in and reflect, those are favorite vacation places.
Speaker 1: All right, now tell me, do you have a favorite saying or phrase?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we'll work it out, probably.  Sometimes when you're past due you end up running into numerous things and numerous concerns and people sweat about it but I usually just say, "Don't worry, we'll work it out" so I guess that would probably be it.
Story_ID: 571798
Speaker 1: Let's start by talking about your mother and her family.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Tell me your mother's name and spell it for me please?
Speaker 2: Okay, my mother's name is Eloise, E-L-O-I-S-E, maiden name, Janerette, J-A-N-E-R-E-T-T-E, last name, Darby, D-A-R-B-Y [Eloise Janerette Darby].  Mom was, well she's deceased now.  She was born in 1909, August 13th, no, August 16th, 1909.  She was born in or near Sumter, South Carolina, she was the youngest of about seven children, I believe.  She was a teacher by profession, needless to say, retired by the time she left this earth.  Very good lady.  My father [Joseph Darby, Sr.] passed when I was three so she pretty much raised me singlehanded with some help from uncles and such and aunts and such but very strong-willed lady, very inspirational lady, wonderful sense of humor, diminutive lady, she could eat a whole cow and not gain a single pound.  Very solicitous of my well-being.  I was the only son and I'm probably on the tail end of my generations of cousins so that made me royally spoiled coming up.
Speaker 1: Did she share any stories about her growing up?
Speaker 2: Ah, that's a wonderful question.  What I got from mom about her growing up probably would have been in bits and pieces.  She talked about how she was the youngest baby in her family and how she remembers being told that when she was born, a couple of the oldest said, "We don't need this thing here to, you know, that this is another mouth, we can't deal with this."  And one of her brothers who was her favorite brother, ended up being one of my favorite uncles, was one who was supposed to have come to her defense.  She told me about that.  She told me about traveling a little bit with my older uncle, oldest uncle, who is also deceased now, who was also a minister and learning a little bit about how South Carolina looked and how South Carolina went just from being in his presence.  He was old enough to be older brother, slash father, I think, so they had a good relationship.  She talked a lot about that.  Didn't tell a lot of other childhood stories, actually.
Story_ID: 571799
Speaker 1: Well we're going to, we'll come back to your relationship with your mother [Eloise Janerette Darby] but tell me about her mother and father.
Speaker 2: Her mother and father were Jackson and Annie Janerette.  Jackson Janerette was a textile worker, mill worker, born in Eastover, South Carolina.
Speaker 1: I'm sorry, where?
Speaker 2: Eastover.
Speaker 1: Eastover?
Speaker 2: E-A-S-T-O-V-E-R, South Carolina, about thirty miles outside of Columbia [South Carolina].  His wife, my grandmother, Annie, was a teacher as well, born, I'm not sure where she was born, but migrated from Sumter [South Carolina] to Columbia, that's where she met him.  I know that both of them are buried in Eastover and interestingly at a church I used to pastor in Eastover, St. Philip A.M.E. [St. Philip A.M.E. Church, Eastover, South Carolina], so.
Speaker 1: Do you remember them?
Speaker 2: I don't remember either one of them, he passed away.  I don't even know when he would have passed away.  I know my grandmother passed when I was an infant, probably about '52 [1952], I think.
Speaker 1: Okay, and you said your grandfather was a, he was a minister?
Speaker 2: No, I have two uncles who were ministers on my mother's side of the family, Ivy [Ivy W. Janerette] and Verseal, V-E-R-S-E-A-L, Janerette [Verseal Janerette], granduncle who was a minister on my mother's side of the family, James C. Johnson [ph.], and a great-grandfather, who was a minister on my mother's side of the family who was Ivy W. Johnson [ph.].
Speaker 1: Ivy, spell that for me.
Speaker 2: I-V-Y.
Speaker 1: And he was your great-grandfather?
Speaker 2: Right.
Story_ID: 571800
Speaker 1: Now, back to talking about your mother [Eloise Janerette Darby].
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Tell me about your relationship with her.
Speaker 2: Very close.  She, once my father [Joseph Darby, Sr.] passed, she basically put all of her energy, all of her spirit, all of her time, all of her interest into raising me, nurturing me, so we had a very close relationship.  She was the kind of mother who had the ability to be tough without being mean.  She had the ability to bring out the best in you and to make you want to do your best to, to give the kind of, what we now call positive reinforcement to encourage you to reach high, to encourage you to do the right thing, very solicitous of my well-being.  I was just old enough to be, probably middle school in wanting to be involved in the Civil Rights Movement in the mid-'60s [1960s] and she would have none of that because I was her baby boy.  She wasn't going to have me locked up or arrested or killed so I never did get to, get a feel for that as I had hoped that I would but she did her best to try to expose me to, I think, a wide range of things that a family, that's almost like trees in a forest: close enough to nurture each other but not so close that we got on each other's nerves, and so very good and very supportive extended family as well but mom put pretty much all of her being into trying to make sure I came out okay.
Speaker 1: You said she was a teacher.  Do you know where she went to school?
Speaker 2: Yeah, she went to Allen University [Columbia, South Carolina] and that was in the days when Allen actually took you from elementary all the way through bachelor's [degree] and that's what she did, went to Allen from elementary through high school through four years of college.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Anything else you want to share about your mother?
Speaker 2: Ah, let's see.  She taught in, I think, Newberry County [South Carolina].  She taught also for state government in what is now the Department of Juvenile Justice [South Carolina Department of Juvenile Justice].  It's called, back then, it was the colored reformatory and she taught at, at school there.  That's where she retired from, John G. Richards School [John G. Richards Youth Detention Center] in Columbia [South Carolina].  Very devoted to her church, our home church, in Columbia, St. James A.M.E. [St. James A.M.E. Church, Columbia, South Carolina]. Very devoted to family.  Had the ability that I think I'm glad she passed on to me not to take herself too deathly seriously, very humble of spirit and, and pulled off, somehow, being regal and being humble at the same time.  I don't know if that's an easy thing to do, but she did that well.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  And was there any talk in your family through your uncles or aunts about anyone on your mother's side of the family being in slavery?
Speaker 2: Not really, beyond the fact that, that my first preaching ancestor, Ivy Johnson [Ivy W. Johnson (ph.)], was just in that generation that came out of slavery so there's very little doubt that he was a part of that but there's a little oral history on mom's side of the family.  Part of the product of that is probably because I'm on the tail end of that generation.  I'm probably about fifteen years younger, twenty years younger than most of my first cousins and so I'm sure there's some family history that I simply didn't get because I wasn't born right in that point in the loop and that's the kind of thing that probably started to be lost in that generation.
Story_ID: 571801
Speaker 1: Let's talk about your dad.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Tell me your father's name.
Speaker 2: Joseph Anthom Darby, Sr. [Joseph Darby, Sr.], I'm actually a junior.  He was born in Anthon, Iowa and apparently the family did some things, agricultural.  His parents, Henry Darby, Minnie McClain Darby [Minnie Darby], were born in Calhoun County in South Carolina, a little place called Fort Motte and they, at some point in time, migrated to Iowa.  That's where my dad was born, that's how he got his middle name from that town of his birth.  He was one of about six children, and did not get to know him nearly as well as I would like to.  He passed away when I was three years old so I just have very foggy memories of him.  I do know that he worked as a chauffeur.  I do know that he was a World War II [WWII] veteran, [U.S.] Army Air Corps, that he was in what's now called, I think, Gray's registration [ph.] in the [U.S.] military.  He was one of the guys in Germany who cleared the runway of remains when planes crashed, so I know that much about him but beyond that, very shadowy.
Speaker 1: Okay, now tell me your grandparents' name again?
Speaker 2: Grandparents on my father's side, Henry Darby and Minnie, middle name McClain, M-C-C-L-A-I-N, Darby.
Speaker 1: Okay, and do you know much about them?
Speaker 2: I know very, very little about them.  Information about that side of the family has really been kind of sparse.  I knew aunts and uncles but, let's see, I had one uncle, one of my father's brothers living in Columbia [South Carolina] that I knew growing up but did not know that well.  His sister, only sister, was very close.  She lived with us for a while, that I knew quite well but, but she was not a great big talker so she didn't talk a lot about that side of the family beyond the fact that they were out of Calhoun County and we still have some linkages there.  Darby history in South Carolina is interesting because every now and then, because every now and then we'll run into somebody that is named Darby and we'll try to compare notes and figure out if we know relations and we can almost never identify relations but then I always see physical resemblances so--
Speaker 1: (Cough) Excuse me.
Speaker 2: --it's a different kind of thing.  So it's a different kind of thing.
Story_ID: 571802
Speaker 1: So you were an only child--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and while your mother [Eloise Janerette Darby] was working during the day and you came home from school, who was there with you?
Speaker 2: Actually, mom's working hours are such that by the time I got in, she was usually there.  That's why she chose that John G. Richards [John G. Richards School; John G. Richards Youth Detention Center, Columbia, South Carolina] option.  This was in the days when they weren't too interested, I suppose, in giving much education to incarcerated black children.  So the school day was short enough that about the time I would be walking up the hill to school, she would be leaving to go out to John G. and about the time I'd be getting back from school, she would be getting back from John G., so.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Tell me about the community in which you lived, the people that lived in your community and what were their occupations?  What did they do?
Speaker 2: Oh, gosh, let's see.  Coming up, I lived in the community in Columbia [South Carolina] called Wheeler Hill which at the time was a very stable, very vibrant, very colorful community.  I guess it was kind of a microcosm of urban African American life in the South then, Wheeler Hill.  It had a reasonably diverse population, I guess you would say middle class at the time.  You had a number of families where there was a professional vocational blend where the mother of the family would be a school teacher, nurse, something like that, where the father in the family would be something more skilled like a brick mason, carpenter, something like that.  There were a lot of the families like that around.  There were plenty of kids.  God knows we had tons of children in the, in the community.  Fairly self-contained community.  It had the obligatory two Jewish grocery stores.  It had the high school within walking distance.  Booker T. Washington High [Booker T. Washington High School, Columbia, South Carolina], elementary school within walking distance, Florence C. Benson Elementary [Florence C. Benson Elementary School, Columbia, South Carolina], three churches, an A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] church, an A.M.E. Zion Church, Baptist church, within about five or six blocks of each other.  You had the traditional system of community control wherein if you did not belong to one of those churches, you pretty much didn't belong on the Hill no matter how much a character you were.  It was fun being able to see folk that you knew were raising holy hell on Saturday, sitting up in church on Sunday morning, might not have had their heads on straight but they knew that they had to be there on Sunday mornings.  It was a community that never really, well it didn't get the chance to slide downhill, actually, because it fell victim to what was then called urban renewal.  The University of South Carolina [Columbia, South Carolina] bought that property because the neighborhood was, quote unquote, distressed.  We didn't see the distress because it was about 50 percent owner occupied, the rental housing was well-kept, it was average rental housing for the '50s [1950s] but it was well-kept and in the early '60s [1960s], they just kind of dismantled and demolished that community and spread folk around, but up until that time, it was a very vibrant place.
Story_ID: 571803
Speaker 1: It was also in a part of Columbia [South Carolina] that was contiguous to a very similar white community, Olympia [Olympia-Granby, Columbia, South Carolina].  Olympia community was where the textile mills were in Columbia and so there was an interesting rite of passage.  The rite of passage, if you were a young black male, was to be able to stay in Olympia after dark and not get your tail kicked.  The rite of passage, if you were a young white male, was to stay somewhere in Wheeler Hill [Columbia, South Carolina] after dark and not get your tail kicked.  It was also close to the University of South Carolina [Columbia, South Carolina], attractive to the university which I think was probably its demise and that was always a source of worry for parents in that community, the way that they kept us under control, kept us from making mistakes, it probably could have gotten us killed if we had been in the wrong place at the wrong time.  There was never a statement that the Klan [Ku Klux Klan, KKK] will come out at night and kill you but every child on the Hill was told that Carolina does have pre-med students and pre-med students will snatch you in the night and do experiments on you and will never see you again.  So, everybody stayed the heck away from Carolina's campus, as far as they could.  What else about Wheeler Hill?  In its--in its latter years, it started to transition a bit and looking back on it, I missed what it was now, because there were unspoken rules of respect in the community and you didn't cross those lines.  One of my vivid memories when I was younger, is of someone snatching a purse, pulling a lady down, during the last year or two that I lived on the Hill and he ran past our house.  When he got past our house, my mother [Eloise Janerette Darby], all ninety pounds of her probably, called his name, the purse snatcher stopped, came back, she chewed him out for about five good solid minutes, chewed him out, made him go back, check on the lady, make sure she was all right, pick her up, dust her off, give her her purse and then say a thing, "You know I'm going to call your mama by the time you get home because you know better than this."  That's the way community used to work.  I wish we could recapture that sense of community but that was the community of my, probably elementary up to elementary school years.
Speaker 2: Did you live in a house or an apartment?
Speaker 1: House.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah, house, owner occupied (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Did you, did you have, oh, so your mother did own the home?
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.  My dad [Joseph Darby, Sr.] apparently bought the home a few years before our, before he passed away, so, we did own a home.
Story_ID: 571804
Speaker 1: Now I want you to think about that time that you gave me a great description of the neighborhood but personally for you, if you think of a sound or a smell that would take you home or a sight that takes you back to that time.
Speaker 2: A sound or smell or sight.  (Laughter) Probably the smell that, that's community related, not necessarily home related (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) It can be, yeah, that's fine.
Speaker 2: --is grape Kool-Aid.  When I was much younger, one of the highlights of the year I thought really (unclear), was Vacation Bible School.  You went from church to church to Vacation Bible School and there was this old man at St. James [St. James A.M.E. Church, Columbia, South Carolina] named E.J. Johnson [ph.].  Mr. E.J. used to make grape Kool-Aid in this big tin washtub and, you know, it was one of those things where as we got older, we reflected on it at, you know, in first and second grade, that Kool-Aid was great.  About third or fourth grade, we started saying, "I wonder if Mr. E.J. bathes in that same tub we get the grape Kool-Aid out of."  So we started leaning a little more towards water at the--but I remember the grape Kool-Aid smell more than anything, I think.  Sound-wise, probably train whistle because there was a Southern Railway track that ran behind the house, cut across the couple of streets in the neighborhood before going on its merry way and, and that train was something that you could set your clock by, at least three or four times a day.
Speaker 1: Okay, and sights?
Speaker 2: Sights.  Probably, beyond just the sights of friends and the remembrances of the sights of school [Florence C. Benson Elementary School, Columbia, South Carolina], the interesting sight I used to have on the Hill [Wheeler Hill, Columbia, South Carolina] where we lived was right opposite of a couple of [U.S.] Army Reserve places, white Army Reserve places, actually.  There was an Army Reserve and a [U.S.] Marine Corps Reserve place next to each other.  So, it was interesting to see an all-black community where on at least one weekend a month, these white guys would come and descend across the street from the house and would do whatever they did in those buildings because, I don't know what they did in the Reserve then, but they never came outdoors.  They were in the building the whole time they were there.  Maybe about once a year they'd do some kind of military exercise that involved going somewhere in jeeps but just seeing them come and go in the Hill was probably the unfamiliar sight that sticks with me.
Story_ID: 571805
Speaker 1: What did you do in the summer?
Speaker 2: I'd love to tell you I relax but I'd be lying through my teeth (laughter).  During the summer, you mean now or back then?
Speaker 1: No, no, back then.
Speaker 2: Oh, back then.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Back then during the summers, mostly around home, playing in the community, stuff like that.  Normally there would be at least a one-week vacation somewhere, had an uncle in Washington [D.C.] and his family, an uncle in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] and his family, probably my closest cousin contacts right now.  Had an uncle in New York so, and my aunt, the folks that she was a cook for, my father's [Joseph Darby, Sr.] sister, they would go off to the mountains in North Carolina to spend the summer and we'd usually end up going for a couple of days, maybe a week up to be with Aunt Beulah [Beulah Darby] in the mountains because she had her own little place up there on their property.  So you're talking about a summer where I got to be a kid a lot, got to play a lot, got to read a lot, got to get usually a week or two out of town.  The A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] church had and still has, an obligatory summer activity where you want to go where all children go within the church and where we pretty much told you, well enjoy this whether you like it or not, you're going to enjoy this.  And so I'd end up going to Youth Congress, Leadership Congress.  Summer, it also involved visitors.  The Leadership Congress, the A.M.E. meeting would bring folks from all over South Carolina into Columbia [South Carolina] and this was in the day when there was only one black hotel in Columbia.  So, you know, you stayed with people.  You stayed with relatives, you stayed with friends and so when Leadership Congress would come, you could be well-assured that our family from up around Florence [South Carolina], Mullins, South Carolina, maybe somebody else, as well, would end up coming to descend on us for a week or so.  The kin that we visited in the North, you know, would usually make a southern migration at some point during the summer.  So, it was always a time when you would see these faces you only saw once a year or maybe once every couple of years, and get to spend time with them as well.
Story_ID: 571806
Speaker 1: Tell me about your elementary school.  What was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Florence C. Benson.
Speaker 1: Tell me again.
Speaker 2: Florence C. Benson Elementary School [Columbia, South Carolina].  Benson was maybe a four block walk from my house.  It was basically the colored, quote unquote, elementary school for Wheeler Hill [Columbia, South Carolina].  Very positive, very nurturing place.  Benson was where the love for learning, I think, that my mother [Eloise Janerette Darby] sparked in me.  It kind of got developed up a little bit more.  Benson was where I had some wonderful teachers.  I think I even remember their names, probably still.
Speaker 1: Yeah, what are some of the teachers' names?
Speaker 2: Ah, let's see.  First grade was Ms. Loudelle Castor [ph.].  Second grade was Ms. Henrietta Swett.  Third grade was, no I got that backwards, yeah, I got that back--first grade was Artelis Williams [ph.], she'd kill me if she knew that, put her in the wrong place, Ms. Williams.  Second grade was Ms. Castor, was Ms. Swett, Henrietta Swett.  Third grade was Loudelle Castor.  Fourth grade was Catherine Pelot.  Fifth grade was Robbie Reed [ph.] and all of them were wonderful, demanding, Nazi ladies who forced you to do the best work that you possibly could, who took very little stuff and were kind and loving at the same time.  And remarkably, I think all of them are still alive and I still run into them from time to time when I go home to visit in Columbia [South Carolina], but they set a positive standard.  They managed to make learning something that you enjoy but something you had no question about and, and it was a, a good school on a couple of levels, one, because, it was an extended community.  Every now and then I'd hear from, get all lathered up about how prayer ought to be back in the public schools because when we were in school, we prayed.  Well, by God, when I was at Benson, yeah, we prayed but most of the teachers at Benson either went to one of those three churches on Wheeler Hill or another church we knew of in Columbia and everybody was black.  My wife [Mary Bright Darby] taught at a school not far from Benson after we were married and the community had changed greatly 'cause we used to laugh about prayer in school and she would say, "I don't know what to do because the school is near Carolina, I have to come up with a prayer that's good for Hindu children, Christian children, Baha'i children, Buddhist children, Muslim children, Jewish children and children who might be nothing else in particular," you know, so it was, Benson was more of a microcosm.  It was that kind of atmosphere where there was a tie that went beyond the education but there was also the education that involved something that I don't see as much in school these days, positive peer reinforcement for educational achievement.  There was no Public Law 192 [sic. Education for All Handicapped Children Act of 1975].  There was no special ed [special education].  There was no self-contained.  There were no IEPs [Individualized Education Program].  If a kid wasn't doing well, he just did better, she just did better and if that was your friend, then you kindly help to pull them along to make them do better and we lost that somewhere along the way, but Benson had that kind of school.  Benson was one of those schools that also put a premium on some things that I don't think young people get today.  You, it's very seldom that young people do public speaking.  One of the elements that we try to put into the mentoring program we do at church now, is an element that includes public speaking, because they don't get to memorize poetry, memorize Shakespeare [William Shakespeare], things like that that we had no option on back then, that helped to build self-confidence, it helped to make one a little more glib as one got older.  Benson did all of those things and, and it did it in a way that linked to the family, maintained the close contact to the family and established learning as a part of community.
Story_ID: 571807
Speaker 1: So with these programs in place, did public speaking help you build your confidence?
Speaker 2: Yeah, and I'm still a believer that that's the case.  We're doing this interview in what has been an interesting week when one of our presidential candidates [Joe Biden] kind of stuck his political foot in his mouth because he referred to Barack Obama [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama] as being, clean and articulate, and I always get amused when I hear that because articulate used to go with the territory where I grew up.  You know, and it was understood then to be a required, I had one of my teachers just flatly tell me, "This is the way that you talk to get a job," because I think, if I remember correctly, I told Ms. Castor [Loudelle Castor (ph.)], "I ain't got no pencil" and she said, "No say, you do not have a pencil.  I ain't got is what you say when you're home, talking to your people.  I do not have is what you say when you're out trying to get into another school or trying to get a good position, so learn how to master that, so you can maneuver in the world."  That used to be the worldview for people of color in the South, that you had two sets of understanding, an understanding for what you do at home and then an understanding what you do beyond home.
Speaker 1: Okay, you said that you liked to read.  What did you like to read?
Speaker 2: Comics, I loved comics.  I kick myself now because I know that I'd be rich enough to sail the world and put my youngest all the way through school if I just held onto some of the comic books I had then, but comics, the little graphic novel type things that used to be out then, 'The Hardy Boys' [Franklin W. Dixon] type stuff, pretty much whatever I could get my hands on and I was a pretty decent reader.  One of the very pleasant little hustles that I don't talk about much when I was younger, when I was about eight, I was fairly decent at pronouncing large words and the guys in high school knew that and so I became a little bit of a ringer.  They would bet somebody who didn't know the community, "Hey, I betcha Darby [HistoryMaker Reverend Joseph Darby] can say that word."  And the other person, and these would be high school age guys at least and the other guy would say, "No, Darby can't say that word."  And they'll say, "Darby, what's that word?"  "Czechoslovakia," and they'll go, "Pay."  So, (laughter) I made a few little pennies that way, along the way.
Speaker 1: Okay. Was there a favorite teacher of yours?
Speaker 2: I don't think so.  I think it would be hard to pick a favorite because each of those teachers down through the years, even in high school [Booker T. Washington High School, Columbia, South Carolina], had own, had their own strengths and had their own positive traits and each of them left an impression so much so that I do still remember a lot of those names and because of that, I don't know if I would even risk picking a favorite, I just appreciate the shaping that all of them did.
Speaker 1: Okay, talking about reading, was there a library in your school?
Speaker 2: There was a library in my school and it's a fairly well equipped library for a black school in South Carolina in the '50s [1950s].  There was also an African American branch of the Richland County Public Library [Richland Library, Columbia, South Carolina], not all that far from my house that, you know, I was amazed when I found out there was another library further downtown because the only one I was aware of was the Phillis Wheatley library [Richland Library Wheatley, Columbia, South Carolina] and for its time it was also fairly well stocked.  Columbia [South Carolina] had the blessing, still has the blessing of some institutions of higher learning, Allen University [Columbia, South Carolina] is Columbia based.  Benedict College [Columbia, South Carolina], it's Columbia based.  South Carolina State University [Orangeburg, South Carolina], then South Carolina State College was, maybe, a forty minute drive, same for Claflin University, both of them are in Orangeburg [South Carolina].  Voorhees College, it's in Denmark [South Carolina], about same distance, forty minute drive.  So, there was an appreciation for learning in the middle as a South Carolina's African American community that goes way, way back.
Speaker 1: All right, so when, what year do you graduate from elementary school [Florence C. Benson Elementary School, Columbia, South Carolina]?  Do you go straight into high school or is there a middle school?
Speaker 2: No, no middle, we went straight in.  Now you have to make me count, seven [1957], '58 [1958], '59 [1959], '60 [1960], '61 [1961], '62 [1962], 1962 would have been graduation year, I guess, for elementary school.
Story_ID: 571808
Speaker 1: In the years before, just before you get out of elementary school [Florence C. Benson Elementary School, Columbia, South Carolina], Brown versus the Board of Education [Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954] takes place.  Does it affect Columbia [South Carolina] at all?
Speaker 2: None whatsoever.  There was no impact of Brown v. Board until my senior year of high school, really, and really beyond my senior year before that effect became profound.  The only thing I knew, because I did have two preacher uncles, the one in Columbia, active as most clergy were then at some level in the Civil Rights Movement, I knew that it had been passed. I knew that South Carolina had not only refused to accept the national law, they had also created a special commission headed by, I think, Rem- not Rembert Dennis, what was the man's name, Marion Gressette, who was the speaker of the house [sic. president pro tempore, South Carolina Senate], a committee to head off that legislation, to blunt that, stop that and make sure that it didn't happen.  And so in South Carolina, it wasn't until maybe I was in seventh or eighth grade that you started to get some bounce of the effect of Brown versus Board, and that first bounce was really minimal.  It was at that point in time that they did away with zoning lines all together and said, whatever school you want to go to, you can go to that school under the supposition that white kids would go to the white schools, traditional white schools, the black kids would go to the traditional black schools.  It wasn't until 1967 that Booker Washington had, Booker T. Washington High [Booker T. Washington High School, Columbia, South Carolina], that's where I went, had a smattering of black teachers.  It was not until 1969 that I sat in a class with a white kid and that was during actually a summer interim of '68 [1968], '69 [1969] when computers were the brave new world and they were talking about how to program and punch cards and stuff like that.  And it wasn't until 1970, until they actually fully integrated the schools and that was an amazing sight to see because I never saw a bigger painting crew descend on a place and it descended on Booker T. Washington High School to paint lockers, to paint classrooms, to varnish floors, to update labs, to do everything that should have been done since that school was built in 1940, what didn't get done until that time but there was very little impact.  Looking back at it today, though, at the rhetoric of the day, helps me to explain why I have no patience with people in general, black folk in particular who get up and say a bunch of hooey about vouchers and choice because I remember the rhetoric of the day.  Part of what South Carolina did to try to stave off integration was to offer vouchers, to offer a tax credit to parents who decided to send their children to schools, private schools, that were created to maintain segregation.  The other piece of it was to do away with attendance lines and say, you can send your child to any school you want, you have freedom of choice and so every time somebody says this is new, this is progressive, this is the latest thing in education now, we say, no it isn't.  Everything old is simply new again, it's just as funky now as it was back then.
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Excuse me for the rant (laughter).
Speaker 1: That's okay (laughter).
Story_ID: 571809
Speaker 1: So, you go to high school in 1962 and Booker T. Washington [Booker T. Washington High School, Columbia, South Carolina] is the school that you go to (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: So tell me about your high school days.
Speaker 2: Booker T. Washington was an institution, a joy, a way of life, a transcendental experience.  Booker T. Washington, I think, helped to make me much of what I am today and it's, it's one of those cases where, for the classes that went through Booker T., you know, as, as we get older, reunions become relative, and for a lot of folks, I know the college reunion gets to be the one that gets the most emphasis, because that's where you get your last piece of whatever, your last piece of formation, educationally.  For those folks who went to Booker T., Booker T. Washington's reunions, are still focal points, still well attended focal points, because it was a wonderful institution.  It was an excellent quality school.  First, because--partly because--of the circumstance of the segregated South.  If, if there was someone who was African American and professional in the South in those days, then their career choices outside of medicine, possibly, were limited to preaching and teaching.  And so people who went away from South Carolina wanted to come back to South Carolina, who came back with master's [degrees], who came back with Ph.D.'s from, from good northern institutions, ended up in the classroom.  And so I think most of the teachers that I had going through high school had graduate degrees, a good chunk of 'em had doctorate degrees.  They had that same attitude of the high school teachers that you're going to perform whether you like it or not and, and it created that same kind of positive atmosphere.  Booker T. was the kind of place where you could sate your thirst for knowledge and at the same time act the fool, which I think is a part of growing up.  One of the confessions that I never made publicly but I'll make here, since I think she's too old to catch me now, is, is that we had a math test coming up once at Booker, ninth grade, and the teacher, Ms. Willingham, bless her heart, just cackled all week about it because she knew that this was a new concept for us.  We're in trigonometry, we were not up on trig and she was just cackling about that test.  The day of the test, Booker Washington was also near a creek so I might have caught one of those fairly good sized creek rats and put it in Ms. Willingham's desk drawer and when class came, Ms. Willingham was just cackling and when she opened the drawer where the test was supposed to be, she stopped in mid cackle and the last thing we remember is a streak heading down the halls, so Booker Washington gave you the chance to expand your horizons in many ways.  It was also where I developed a good piece of my love for music.  I played on the band, had marching and concert band under a gentleman by the name of Harold June who was also the mentor for one of his own boys in Cheraw, South Carolina, who used to play trumpet, a little younger than him by the name of Dizzy Gillespie.  Prof June was our band teacher.  Booker Washington, had one of the serious bands of South Carolina, the day, called ourselves the Marching 100 after Florida A&M [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida].  Actually they had managed to field a hundred kids, got to take some wonderful trips, Cherry Blossom Festivals [National Cherry Blossom Festival] in Washington [D.C.], stuff like that and it's where I came to have that kind of an appreciation for music, appreciation for the arts as well because it wasn't just you learned how to boogie, it was also that you learned how to do serious music.  It was how you learned how to compete so that by the time I was in high school, I was making all-city band with the white kids as well as all-state band with black kids because all-state was separate then but it was one of those, Booker Washington was one of those wonderful schools that, that was both an institution of education and a rite of passage.  When you went there you knew that you had taken another step in your growth as an African American in the South and, and another step in maturation and you cherished that.  That got to be a very special memory.
Story_ID: 571810
Speaker 1: It's one of those times when, between home, school and church, those were the pillars of the African American community and it distresses me sometimes now that the only one of those pillars left is the church.  I have lived long enough to come to take the sometimes controversial but more often supported view that we actually lost something when we desegregated the schools because they never did really integrate.  Integration implies a blending of the best characteristics of both, and that didn't happen in South Carolina.  In South Carolina we had desegregation which meant black and white kids could sit in the same class together but a lot of quality black teachers, black administrators were shoved to the side so that we now have a situation where my elders, my youngest son [Jeremy Darby] excuse me, did not see one black teacher coming up through high school.  The only teachers he had were white, had some instructional assistants who were black but you lost that, you lost that value ability that was there in those black schools.  You lost that sense of cultural identity that was there in those black schools.  You lost that, whatever it was that said, you can enjoy life but on the other end of enjoying life, as all teens do, there's a counterbalance of responsibility and you have to have that counterbalance to make things weigh out well.
Speaker 2: Good point.
Story_ID: 571811
Speaker 1: Were you involved in student government?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, I was student council vice president, I was student council president, honor society vice president, senior class president.  I think I was even the monitorial staff president when they had hall monitors in the good old days.  I was active in student government then and, you know, these days it would be seen as very mild, very routine, back in our day, it was, you know, we came over with what at that time was radical stuff that you could actually wear jeans to school.  There was radical stuff that if you were a senior, then by God you ought to be able to walk off the campus for lunch and then come back on the campus and not have to stay on the campus.  Those were radical ideas at that time.  So, it came along just at the point where, I graduated from high school in '69 [1969], that was just at the edge of where things were shifting from passive resistance to wait a minute, I'll kick your canned tooth and so there was a shifting in thought.  It's where young people were starting to question things more and more, and it was also the rise of the Black Power movement and, and you got little rumblings of that at Booker [Booker T. Washington High School, Columbia, South Carolina].  When I was a senior in high school, my English teacher, a very nice white lady, Ms. Nussle [ph.], bless her heart, thought that it would be wonderful to bring some of the University of South Carolina [Columbia, South Carolina] ballplayers, because they had recruited, Frank McGuire was coach, one of these fable coaches that they had hired away, I think, from North Carolina [University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina] and he had recruited these young guns, these, these Catholic high school kids from New York who were going to just change basket- and they were good.  I mean, there was John Roche, Tom Owens and a couple other, you know, you have white guys from New York who were going to change basketball and, and Ms. Nussle thought that it would be great to bring them to talk to our class.  Some of us asked and were allowed to boycott that session, because at that same time there were no African American basketball players at the University of South Carolina and we basically let Ms. Nussle know, with all due respect, and great can deference to the day, we don't want to sit and listen to those white boys when that school would not let people like us on the basketball court.  So, it was a nice transitional time at Booker Washington and the school lived for five years after I graduated.  They then decided that it, and I love the way the South decides things, they elected the school board in Richland County [South Carolina] called the Deadline 72 Board [ph.] and the deadline was to get a rein back on the public schools.  The first piece of that getting the rein back in '74 [1974] was to close Booker Washington.  They had already zoned it so that the population going into that school, which it had already changed, just dwindled down.  They then said the buildings were beyond repair and closed it and sold it to the University of South Carolina and now, it always amazed me that they did that because the buildings on that campus were beyond repair.  They tore down the original building, the 1914 building.  The gymnasium stayed in use up until five years ago.  The home ec [home economics] building stayed in use up until two years ago.  The auditorium is still standing and is still in use.  So, I said, that's pretty good use for a place that was sold because it was beyond repair.
Speaker 1: Amazing.
Speaker 2: And Booker, and, and the whole, the thing that goes with that, that I guess also needs to be mentioned is it's one of the things that need to be, needs to be understood, particularly in Columbia [South Carolina] you got a unique relationship.  You have Wheeler Hill, a neighborhood that was decimated by the University of South Carolina.  You've got a couple other neighborhoods beyond that that were bought by the University of South Carolina.  You have a cherished public school, public schools, because Benson's [Florence C. Benson Elementary School, Columbia, South Carolina] old property belongs to Carolina too, that were purchased by the University of South Carolina.  Now times have changed, the people who did that are either retired or dead but you still have folk who grew up on Wheeler Hill that would root for Satan and every demon from hell on the football team against the University of South Carolina, would not root for Carolina under any circumstance.  I'm a graduate of Carolina, after I went to South Carolina State [South Carolina State College; South Carolina State University, Orangeburg, South Carolina] for a year and a half but it, you know, even today, if someone asked me how I identify myself, I'm an alumnus of South Carolina State, I'm a graduate of the University of South Carolina because I went there to get an education, I got it, that was primarily it.
Story_ID: 571812
Speaker 1: Well let's go back, back to 1962, '3 [1963], '4 [1964], '5 [1965], and you mention this was the Black Power movement but the Civil Rights Movement--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --is in full swing.  In '63 [1963], the March on Washington, do you have any memory about the March on Washington?
Speaker 2: TV memory.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was magnificent for a couple of reasons even though I wasn't there.  One, it was, that was a time when you didn't exactly have an abundance of black faces on TV and on the news and with the Civil Rights Movement, especially with the March on Washington, you not only had black faces, you had a sea of black faces on TV, and you had a very eloquent, very articulate speech by Martin Luther King, Jr. [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] that even then impressed me and like most high school kids, I wasn't that easy to impress, seventh, eighth grade but it was--it was a time of an awareness, I guess.  The March on Washington fit into that image.  A time when you understood that the world was changing, that things would not be as they had always been and that if you are fortunate enough you might just be blessed to have a hand in that.
Story_ID: 571813
Speaker 1: What were your thoughts when Kennedy [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy] was killed in '63 [1963]?
Speaker 2: Shock.  When he was killed, I was in sixth grade, I think, sixth or seventh grade, seventh grade, yeah, seventh grade [at Florence C. Benson Elementary School, Columbia, South Carolina], Mr. George Ellis' [ph.] classroom and we got the word that the president had been shot and that was just amazing.  I mean, everybody was dumbfounded, there had been hope penned on him for serious change.  There was initially, interestingly, great fear that Lyndon Johnson [President Lyndon Baines Johnson] was going to be president and I remember my, my mom [Eloise Janerette Darby], the other grown folks saying, "Oh, Lord, Lyndon Johnson is going to be president, we going back to the plantation.  It's going to be hell in the South--,ʺ but it turned out that he, he, way outlived the expectations for him.  He did wonderful things as a president but shock and, and maybe a sense that America is not as much pure and idealistic and, and wondrous as it might possibly be.  You know, my high school years [at Booker T. Washington High School, Columbia, South Carolina] included the murders of John F. Kennedy, of Robert Kennedy [Robert F. Kennedy] and of Martin Luther King, Jr. [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] and each one of those put a little bit of tarnish on the American dream.  Each one of those took away a little bit of that, "If you work hard enough, miracles will happen because it's America."  That's when I started to understand no miracles happen because God blesses you in spite of the fact that you live in America.
Speaker 1: Those figures were really public figures that everybody knew.  Did you have any knowledge of Emmett Till or Malcolm X or any of the, the black people who were assassinated during that time?
Speaker 2: The Malcolm X assassination, yeah.  The Emmett Till really came along when I was not that old myself.  I remember the picture in Jet magazine (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, that was back in the '50s [1950s].
Speaker 2: That was one of the first things I remember seeing in Jet magazine, this horrible picture of this disfigured kid but, you know, all of those died and left Malcolm X out of that list that I just, just went through which I should not have done but all of those very visible things where they had an impact upon you.  The more intimate impact in Columbia [South Carolina] was familiar--familiarity with people who were not nationally known, sometimes not even known beyond the community but had a great impact.  Matthew Perry [Matthew J. Perry], who was a great civil rights lawyer, went on to be a federal judge.  Harold Boulware [Harold R. Boulware], who was one of the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] team on Brown v. Board [Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954], well down here it was Briggs v. Elliott [Briggs v. Elliott, 1952] in South Carolina who went on to become a family court judge.  C.J. Whitaker, an old preacher, politician in Columbia, who was one of the best arm twisters that I'd ever run into that I was blessed to have as something as a mentor in his twilight years, people that you knew from being around.  Dr. Cooper, a old Dr. Cooper, a young Dr. Cooper [Noble Cooper, Sr.], the black dentist.  Dr. Monte [ph.], the black physician.  Any time when there was a sense of unity that you don't have now because, you know, in Columbia in those days, you got to know people who were prominent in, or intimate way because whether you were the doctor or whether you swept floors for a living, the law said that because of the color of your skin, you couldn't go certain places, you couldn't do certain things.  And so there was a bond there that's not there these days.  I wouldn't want to go back to those days but there was a bond there.
Speaker 1: All right.
Story_ID: 571814
Speaker 1: We were talking about your high school days.  What else can you share about high school?
Speaker 2: What else can I share about high school?  It was a part of that expanding view of the world, I guess.  The band trips were good.  Since I was something of an academic ace then, I got to go to some academic things as well.  Senior year in high school, got to go to Washington, D.C. when the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] nationally was campaigning to get eighteen year olds the right to vote, because twenty-one used to be the voting age.  That was my first major trip where I got a taste for advocacy and, and dealing with public policy.  So, it was where, high school was where you came of age.  Plenty of stories.  I probably would still not even let know the night of day (laughter) (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well tell me, tell me the story about your trip.  I mean, what happened?
Speaker 2: That trip, that was a wonderful trip.  We got to ride up on the bus and for God's sake, we got to ride with college students from Allen [Allen University, Columbia, South Carolina], Benedict [Benedict College, Columbia, South Carolina], South Carolina State [South Carolina State College; South Carolina State University, Orangeburg, South Carolina], there's another brother who's a dear colleague in ministry, Hezekiah Stewart, who was, I think, student body president at Allen University then that I met on that trip.  Also it helped to foster an appreciation that you could work together across diverse lines.  There were two black high schools in Columbia [South Carolina], Booker Washington [Booker T. Washington High School, Columbia, South Carolina], Booker T. Washington and C.A. Johnson [C.A. Johnson High School, Columbia, South Carolina], named for the first colored superintendent of schools in Richland County [South Carolina].  Booker was the older school that got to be more of the blue collar school.  C.A. Johnson was more the elite school, the school where the children of the professionals went even though they had just as many thugs as we had at Booker, that was the perception, but the two schools did not get along and, and two of the people that were on that trip together, myself, I was president of student council at Booker T. Washington, and Frank Harris who was president of the student council at C.A. Johnson, and Frank and I actually became friends and we still are friends, on that trip.  It was a reminder that even though you think that because of untenable rumors, you cannot work together, there really are ways that people can work together.  I think that was a major lesson of that trip, that, plus the lesson that if you let a bunch of high school kids get around a bunch of college kids then college kids are able to buy spirituous liquors, you can have a rollicking good time on a trip.
Story_ID: 571815
Speaker 1: Before we talk about what happened, you were trying to get the age for voting lowered, but talk about the rivalry between the schools [Booker T. Washington High School, Columbia, South Carolina and C.A. Johnson High School, Columbia, South Carolina].  In voting up at all, did you notice a class, a caste system between blacks?
Speaker 2: Yes and no.  To a degree that, as I said, the laws bound everybody kind of together with the similar problem then, there wasn't a system then.  At the same time and it varied from city to city.  You knew that you had the Jack and Jill [Jack and Jill of America, Inc.] class.  You had the, The Links [The Links, Incorporated] class and then you had everybody else, you know.  It's with the brown paper bag test is within my memory that if you were darker than a brown paper bag, there was some organizations in the black community you just didn't get into.  Columbia [South Carolina] had a mild case of that and, and I think it was a mild case because you had those institutions of higher learning and because you had those institutions you had people of varying shades, all of whom proven themselves academically, kind of shot holes all through that caste system.  Now, I live in Charleston [South Carolina] now.  Charleston's a little bit different and I'd be more than glad to talk about that caste system (laughter).
Story_ID: 571816
Speaker 1: I was asking about the trip--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --how you felt the outcome of the trip was.
Speaker 2: We found the outcome was very positive.  There were new linkages made.  Actually, some of the people who took that trip together still maintain relationships today, to work on issues today, and I think that's a positive.  It's the first close-up look that we got at government.  It was interesting to see how people evolve, because one of the people that we dropped in on that day was South Carolina representative by the name of William Jennings Bryan Dorn.  He was known to be a segregationist but by 1969, he was reading the tea leaves very clearly and took the time to let us know that he couldn't be real loud about it but he really did think eighteen year olds ought to vote and he was all for that and he appreciated all that the colored had done for South Carolina.  It was also I got to make my first trip to Metropolitan A.M.E. Church in Washington, D.C. and Metro was, it's kind of how denominational cathedrals, I found that to be an interesting experience.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And--
Speaker 1: Go ahead.
Speaker 2: Well, I found it to be an interesting--the thing that I found to be the most interesting piece of the experience was that it wasn't worship but it was a rally and I think that's the first time in my life I've ever heard a car alarm, because Metro is downtown.  Somebody tried to boost somebody's car and there was a nice round of applause when the guy's alarm went off instead, you got to disengage it.  I also didn't realize when I was in Metropolitan and listening to the pastor of that church who was a very good talker and seemed very progressive that I was also listening to the man who would one day be the bishop who would ordain me a deacon in the church, Frank Reid, Jr. [Frank M. Reid, Jr.], whose son [Frank M. Reid, III] is now a very prominent A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] minister.
Story_ID: 571817
Speaker 1: Besides the band, what other music did you listen to during that time?
Speaker 2: Oh, by force or by choice?
Speaker 1: By choice.
Speaker 2: By choice, it was probably a fairly diverse, fairly diverse.  You had in Columbia [South Carolina], coming up really one black radio station, WOIC [WOIC Radio].  So WLIC was the soul station.  That's where you heard all of what you wanted to hear.  You also had all these other stations, some of which had relationships with the high schools where they'd have one high school deejays and stuff like that.  So you developed a little bit of an appreciation for The Beatles, and a little appreciation beyond your neighborhood for music as well.  Because of my relationship on the band, I had developed and I still do have a strong affinity for classical music.  It's something I appreciate.  I appreciate, I think, all musical forms and I think that started with the richness of the musical experience back then.  I think, too, that it was where you learned a piece of how that counterbalance worked in those days because you would go out on the weekend and you would hear whatever was hot in contemporary but you were also going to be on church, in church on Sunday to hear, "Jesus loves me this I know for the Bible tells me so," ['Jesus Loves Me'] and that helped you to separate that which is entertainment from that which is reality.
Story_ID: 571818
Speaker 1: Well, let's talk about the church.  Were you--well you told me that in your community everybody went to church.  What was your religious experience like?
Speaker 2: Well, I was born up, born in the A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] church, went into ministry in the A.M.E. church.  If I had made any other choice, there would have been three, four generations, of Janerettes and Darbys just spinning in their graves probably and coming back to haunt me.  I don't remember life without the church, quite frankly.  I grew up in St. James A.M.E. Church in Columbia [South Carolina].  I grew up on the Sunbeam Choir and then onto the junior choir and then onto a couple of adult choirs before I went into ministry.  I grew up going to church school and Vacation Bible School.  I grew up going to church with my mother [Eloise Janerette Darby].  I grew up listening to the bad, the good and the sometimes bad of church because churches are filled with people.  That was always a part of my life.  It got to be what, I believe, religion best is, not something that you compartmentalize but something that kind of runs like a thread through all of life, and regulates all of life.  I think that as I grew that got to be more and more the case until I actually entered the call to ministry against my better judgment, you know, so.
Speaker 1: What do you mean?
Speaker 2: I didn't want to preach.  I mean, this is not where I saw myself.  My wife [Mary Bright Darby] still teases me if we ever have any dispute or if I'm congratulating her on our thirty plus years of marriage, she'll always say, "You know, you told me you were going to be a lawyer."  I say, "Yeah, I know that's what I planned to do."  I did not want to be a minister.  I had two [maternal] uncles [Ivy W. Janerette and Verseal Janerette], I had seen the best and the worst of that because being that close to two preachers, you got to see the official and public face of the church and then you got to appreciate the undercurrent, that drive, that's driven by human nature, not only in individual congregations but on larger governmental entities in the church as well and up to the denominational level.  I grew up, really, having my teen years in what was something of a tumultuous time for the A.M.E. church in South Carolina.  I saw my uncles ride that out, I didn't want any part of that, you know, and I came out--
Speaker 1: Well, tell me what, what was it that they were riding out?
Speaker 2: We had, what's a nice way to put it?  'Cause all of the parties are not gone to glory yet.  There were concerns about the way that the district was operating, the Episcopal district was operating, concerns about the bishop who was the then bishop of the district.  Those concerns caused some very hard and fast lines to be drawn, political lines, and you had some people who were able to work across those political lines in the church and some people who drew up those sides and went after things with a my side I must win at all cost kind of mentality, even if it means doing material damage to you and your side, my side must win at all cost.  And I saw how that affected people and I really wanted no parts of it.  I had really planned to be a lawyer.  I rejected the idea of ministry.  What really had me into ministry, my mom passed when I was about twenty-one years old, had been married for about a year and that kind of, even though I was in the church, that pulled me a little further into the church, looking for meeting.  As a part of that pull into the church, I started to actually attend, be active in, church activities beyond the local church, A.M.E. church is marvelously structured so we have a presiding elder district structure and a conference structure and an Episcopal district structure, started to attend things and get involved in activities at that level and the more I went to those things and the more I looked at some of the clergy, quite frankly, I just kept saying to myself, "Geez, I can do better than some of these guys are doing."  And the more I said that, the more there was just that still small voice they talk about on the inside saying, "Well if that's the case, then why don't you?"  And that's how I ended up here, that's how I ended up here.  So, this was not my career choice but I love it to death.

Speaker 1: I'm not sure, and maybe you can shed some light on this, in the A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] church, but did you have a religious experience as far as what some people say when they have an invitation, a call to Christ, a time that you know that you wanted to accept Christ in your life?
Speaker 2: I think I did, and it wasn't, it wasn't a bells ringing, angels singing, Jesus comes and grabs you by the collar and slaps you kind of experience.  It was more something you feel on the inside that says, it's time, and, and for me that was about when I was about fourteen years old and just one Sunday in St. James [St. James A.M.E. Church, Columbia, South Carolina], after the sermon, you know, it was a regular Sunday, but there was something on the inside of me that simply said, it's time and that's when I made that commitment to become a full member of the church, give myself to Christ fully, I think like that.  And my mother [Eloise Janerette Darby] was delighted because, you know, these are the days that about tradition you didn't wait for time.  We forgot that there's a little bit of difference between African Methodist and Catholicism, that there is no confirmation at twelve, that you don't have to become a member of the church at twelve and the contemporary thought at that time was that once you turned twelve, if you did not join the church, you didn't take the Lord's Supper.  And so, because I didn't feel like it was time, I sat out the Lord's Supper for better than a year and a half because it wasn't time, you know.  And when it was time, I knew it just as when it eventually became time to enter ministry, it was the same kind of thing.  You just kind of know when it's time.  God has a way of letting you know that.
Story_ID: 571820
Speaker 1: Are those some of the same things that the traditions still hold true today?
Speaker 2: I think so.  The A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] tradition has changed, I think as most mainline denominations have, some of that for the good, some of that, sometimes I wonder if it's for the good.  Churches tend to evolve and the point of evolution for the A.M.E. church was something called our neo-Pentecostal movement.  It was the advent of some churches that were very charismatic in nature that placed emphasis on things that A.M.E.'s did not, at one time, emphasize, instruments beyond pianos and organs in church, ecstasy in church, speaking in foreign tongues, anointing people with oil for healing and blessing and things like that.  And my time in ministry covers a time when a lot of folks strongly criticized and poo-pooed that kind of stuff but at the same time could not neglect the fact that these were the growing churches, these were where the people were coming out.  And, and what I think it eventually has done, it's not quite there yet, but the eventual outcome, I think, is make the denomination stronger.  So, now you have, you have a denomination that has a comfort level with newer things while being able to hold to its traditions.  I don't go to the extremes that some of my colleagues go to where you threw everything that was traditionally African Methodist out the window.  I think that when you do that kind of thing, you're committing a theological abortion and you end up with nothing but dead stuff left, because you take away and throw out who you are and whose you are but I believe that when you look at what the church should be today, look at what the Lord is saying to the church today, then you start to get a picture of how that new influence changes the church.  It's changed the church I pastor now.  If I had tried when I came into ministry in the '70s [1970s], if I had come to Morris Brown [Morris Brown African Methodist Episcopal Church, Charleston, South Carolina], I would not have found drums in this church.  They had to, you know, thrown somebody and the drums out on their ear but now there's contemporary music and, and we're a congregation that has a choir that sings anthems and the traditional hymns, a choir that sings traditional spirituals, but also a couple of choirs that do contemporary gospel as well as a praise dance troupe, as well as a mime ministry.  So, all of the new stuff that came into the church just helped the denomination as a whole to evolve and to do so in a way that we're still an identifiable denomination.
Story_ID: 571821
Speaker 1: Do you think that's important?
Speaker 2: I think that's very important.
Speaker 1: Okay, tell me why.
Speaker 2: I think I said earlier, when I was coming up, the three pillars of the African American community were the family, the school and the church.  Family, we lost a sense of.  A lot of neighborhoods are not contiguous anymore.  We are more mobile now than we were in those days when people would grow up in one place, spend their lives in the old place, maybe live in one home, possibly two homes their whole lives, that doesn't happen anymore.  We are more mobile, we have, for better or worse, more single families than we used to have.  We don't have the same power of extended family and because we have run into a problem with teen pregnancy, we have some people who are grandmothers at the age where they really are learning to be mothers and some older folk, the great-grands now who are not passing along the lessons of life that great-grands pass along.  So I don't think that family element is what it was.  The school element is definitely not what it was because now, if you have a contin- an African American population in a school, you usually don't have the same number of black teachers.  The teacher corps is more diverse, the schools are not passing along that same lesson of pride and self-confidence.  To me the church is the last bastion of the community, that's why every time somebody gets something, bemoans the fact that Sunday morning at eleven o'clock is the most segregated time in the week, I say, thank the Lord Jesus Christ that it is because there still needs to be something that is uniquely African American, something that is not only the spiritual place but the repository for culture as well.  I think that's the church and I think that when we are (unclear) that when, whether we do those things which make the church prophetic rather than pragmatic.  When the church pays its own way rather than being driven by grant dollars because you can't bark while you're chewing on a bone.  When the church gets a good grip on the needs of the community and is not afraid to speak truth to power.  When the church meets people where they are and helps to get them to where the Lord will have them to be, then I think that's what St. James [St. James A.M.E. Church, Columbia, South Carolina] did for me, almost fifty years ago now, and I think that's still what the church should do today.  I have great concerns sometimes, because a lot of the church gets cosmetic these days.  I know that I have colleagues whose greatest concern is how big their church is, what it looks like and how much it rocks.  I have great concern about a lot of African American clergy who preach a very bogus prosperity gospel in a time when there are a lot of folk who don't need to hear the gospel of prosperity, but first need the gospel of liberation.  But in spite of that, I think the black church is still the last best hope.  I think that's why every now and then you get someone who wants to make inroads into the church, who wants to do away with that horrible segregation of the church and I always want to say, take a hike, you know, because sometimes when they say that there is racism implied in that, even if people don't realize it.  I got a good buddy in the United Methodist church, good colleague, and he said something one day that turned out to be a growth experience for him and he didn't intend it to.  He was talking about how the United Methodist church was created in the late '60s [1960s] by the merger of a number of denominations and he said, you know, we're both Methodist, I think it would be wonderful if the A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] church would merge into the United Methodist church and I said, "Well Fred [ph.], actually you all have been around not officially since '68 [1968], we've been around since 1787.  Why can you not merge into the African Methodist Episcopal?"  He said, "Well I don't think we can do that because you are--."  "Black.  Yes, that's what it got to be.  You're a black church."  And, you know, there should be an acceptance that's just as blending goes one way, blending should go both ways.  We have one white member at Morris Brown [Morris Brown African Methodist Episcopal Church, Charleston, South Carolina] right now, bless her heart.  We don't treat her white at all.  She is a member of the commission of membership and evangelism.  She's a class leader and she's those things because she's capable, she has her head on straight and she has a good level of spirituality.  If she didn't have that, she wouldn't have those positions but, you know, we, during Black History Month, she's one of those folk who's right there on Afrocentric dress day in her Afrocentric stuff and if I get off in some strange directions in the sermon and she doesn't change colors and become offended.  She is a member of the church family and I think that the church has to be like that.  It has to be the repository of the community story and at the same time has to be open to new ideas, while maintaining its identity.
Speaker 1: Okay, we're going to talk more about the church but I want to go back and get a (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay. Hit one of my favorite subjects.
Speaker 1: Okay, yeah.  We'll talk more about the church.
Story_ID: 571822
Speaker 1: A little more personal here, even though I know that's personal (laughter).
Speaker 2: Oh, yes it is.
Speaker 1: But, we're, we were getting ready to enter, or we were in 1969 and you're getting ready to graduate from high school.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Who were the people who might have influenced you or encouraged you about college because, I guess, college was always in, in your mind that you would go to college (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --because of your mother [Eloise Janerette Darby].  At this time, was this when you thought that you wanted to be an attorney or had you made up your mind what you wanted to do?
Speaker 2: No, I had, I had not made up my mind profession-wise.  I had looked at a number of colleges.  I was, what do you call it?  What I think, I guess they still call it, National Achievement Scholar, had the nice SATs so the minority side of the National Merit [National Merit Scholarship] thing I qualified for that and got some serious fishing offerings from a number of colleges.  It turned out that the most attractive one was from South Carolina State [South Carolina State College; South Carolina State University, Orangeburg, South Carolina] because it was a blending of an academic and a music scholarship, and that's where I eventually went, to the concern of some of the folk in the family because some of the folk in the family thought, you don't need to go there because Carolina now is open, University of South Carolina [Columbia, South Carolina], Clemson [Clemson University, Clemson, South Carolina] now is open, you can go to one of those schools and get what you need.  And still that same, it's time voice, that I like listen to said, no, South Carolina State and that's where I ended up going.  My mom encouraged that.  You know, her philosophy was, if that's where you want to go and that's where you think you need to be, then that's where you go.  You don't worry about what the other folks say, but I had a lot of folk questioning the value of HBCUs [historically black colleges and universities], now we do know that there's great value in the HBCUs but, but that's what got me from Booker [Booker T. Washington High School, Columbia, South Carolina] to Carolina, because--Booker to South Carolina State because there had been a number of scholarship offers.  When I tried out for all-state band that year, Cliff Watkins [Clifford Watkins], who was the band director at South Carolina State, was a clinician and based upon my tryout, he said, "If you come to State we'll make sure whatever your music scholarship is, take something, put whatever slack is left."  And that made a major difference.  So, that kept me at South Carolina State for a couple of years.
Speaker 1: Did we ever say what instrument you played?
Speaker 2: Clarinet, that's my favorite.  I also play saxophone.  I can hang a little bit on a couple of other woodwinds, even though flute is not my favorite thing, but clarinet is, is still my instrument of choice.
Story_ID: 571823
Speaker 1: So, going away to college, how was the transition for you from high school [Booker T. Washington High School, Columbia, South Carolina] to college?
Speaker 2: In some ways not bad, in some ways difficult.  It wasn't bad that South Carolina State [South Carolina State College; South Carolina State University, Orangeburg, South Carolina] was just a hop and a skip down the road.  So, if I got lonely or broke, I knew the way home or hungry, I knew the way home.  I appreciated the newfound freedom and like, I think, most college students of my generation were, cherished that freedom to a way that we tried not to mess it up too badly, the ability to, to be your own person, the ability to grow, the ability to meet new friends was all a part and parcel of that freedom.  And so to that end it was not difficult.  What I did find out in college was it was very difficult to hang in with academics of a very demanding marching band at the same time and at that time South Carolina State had an awesome marching band that demanded an awesome amount of time and that's what really made me pray over a couple of things.  One, should I stay there and if I stay at State, should I stay on the band because the band is really eating up time even though I'm getting paid for it.  And then, two, because at that time I was leaning towards some kind of helping profession, I knew that and State offered a degree in social studies but not a degree in sociology which is where I wanted to be right then.  I eventually made the decision to do my last couple of years at the University of South Carolina [Columbia, South Carolina].
Speaker 1: So, you were there for two years?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Did you--and the academics became a little challenging because of you being in the band but you were like, you were top of your class in high school, when you get to college, do you mind--find students that are just as bright as you, and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yeah, I mean, the--the entire, you're in the whole bunch of top of the class people there.  So, you know, if you're top of the class, it used to be a big deal so was I at my high school, that's not a big deal anymore.  So, getting used to the rigors of academic and being on the band it was quite a transition and being, you know, life is really going through a series of ponds.  You go from elementary pond to the high school pond, to the college pond and every pond you start off as a little fish, I think, until you grow.
Speaker 1: Okay, did you pledge?
Speaker 2: Kappa [Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity].
Speaker 1: Was it, which school did you apply?
Speaker 2: South Carolina State.
Speaker 1: State, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Well, tell me about that experience.
Speaker 2: That was a lot of fun too, suffice it to say that was a lot of fun and I think is a great part of the growth experience.
Speaker 1: Well give me, give me some more, give me something about your experience.
Speaker 2: Now I say, yeah I'm old school.  I'm still old school enough that there's a psychological block that you don't talk too much about the frat process.
Speaker 1: Not the process, you know, just saying about, I mean, where the, did you have some parties?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, there were the--
Speaker 1: Did, do you all do community activities?
Speaker 2: There were a heck of a lot more parties than community activities in frat life in those days.  Those were really the, have a good time days and it was probably more near and dear in college than it was after college.  It's become just almost a resume item but you know I have a son who's a Kappa, I have a cousin who's a Kappa, my youngest son just went to a movie that just came out the other day, called 'Stomp The Yard,' now he's saying, "I want to be a Kappa dad, get my cane and everything."  So, it's, it's a nice tradition.  What had helped me to understand too was more of a sense of belonging that goes beyond the lines of family.  You know, we, we as people of color are not privileged to know who, what tribe we came from before our ancestors were snatched and brought here.  We don't know if we are Ashanti or Wolof but there are people who take great pride in being in the Kappa tribe or the Omega [Omega Psi Phi Fraternity] tribe or the Alpha [Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity] tribe or the Delta [Delta Sigma Theta Sorority] tribe or the Masonic tribe, whatever, it almost becomes a kind of extended family along tribal lines.
Story_ID: 571824
Speaker 1: Tell me about your transition to South, to the University of South Carolina [Columbia, South Carolina].
Speaker 2: It was fairly smooth.  I don't think it was complicated, I missed the band but since I knew that if I was still at State [South Carolina State College; South Carolina State University, Orangeburg, South Carolina] I probably wouldn't have been on the band anyway at that point.  Then, that was not a major issue, it was where, I guess practicality started to kick in more because this was a matter of you're going to be out of college in a couple of years and this is before the, this is in the days when, for a lot of folk, a bachelor's [degree] was looked upon as a master's [degree] is now, as a professional degree.  So, the expectation was, you're going to get out of college, you're going to work a little bit here but if you decide to go to grad school, that'll be good but there's a need to get out of college and go to work.  And so, the preparation for work was the emphasis.  I think what I got from Carolina and whatever appreciative of, is that they had a very solid, very scholarly sociology department and it's where I learned, from some very good teachers, to organize my thoughts and to present them in a more systematic manner.  It's also where I had my first major experience with white people in school because, you know, I'd gone from F. C. Benson Elementary [Florence C. Benson Elementary School, Columbia, South Carolina] to Booker T. Washington High [Booker T. Washington High School, Columbia, South Carolina], to South Carolina State and now all of a sudden I truly understood the meaning of minority.  I was the only student in some classes, one of a few in some classes, it was interesting that there were just enough and not too many black students at Carolina even in 1971 that if you saw each other on campus, you were glad to see each other on campus and to greet each other accordingly.  Glad that were was a little black corner in the student union house where you could hang out and associate with people.  And, and State, Carolina, was that, it started to turn that corner, that's really when I feel like it started to turn that corner from youth into preparing for adulthood, at least.
Story_ID: 571825
Speaker 1: So we were talking about your preparing to go into the work force, really (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, Carolina days and that Carolina, I think, did that quite well.  It helped me and I think it was a good step at a good time because it did help me to hone my interactions with those who were not of my culture, to understand a wee bit more about maneuvering in that culture, to see it firsthand and it didn't hurt that my degree was in sociology, behavioral science, so I got to be a student of behavior beyond my culture as it was and I think that that was a very positive thing.  That time overlapped a lot of the time of radical student activity in the late '60s [1960s], early '70s [1970s], nationally as well, so, when I got to Carolina, there was still such a thing as a hippie culture and I got to see that culture as well and see how it sometimes complemented and sometimes clashed with African American culture with that moving away from the days of King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] to the days of black power.
Speaker 1: I see.  Can you say that, or can you remember a time that you experienced blatant racism or prejudice?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.  Shoot, when?  My first understanding that there was a problem was coming back on a trip on the train after we had been to see my Uncle Harold [Harold Darby].  I had not thought about the fact, really, and I was five years old at the time, I thought about the fact that everybody in our train car was black on the way up to New York, that's where it was, Uncle Harold, and it didn't really hit me until we were on the way back because while we were there, it was an election year.  This is in the days when the Solid South was a solidly Democratic South.  The Democratic primary was legally a private club so even if black folk registered to vote, they were not able to vote in the Democratic primary where decisions were really made.  All black folk in the South then were Republicans 'cause that was the party of Lincoln [President Abraham Lincoln].  While we were in New York, my mother [Eloise Janerette Darby] had bought me an I like Ike t-shirt.  I loved that little shirt.  It had a nice little picture of the president [President Dwight David "Ike" Eisenhower] on it.  The minute we crossed the border into Virginia, my mama took that t-shirt off of me, put another shirt on me and packed that sucker away and I was protesting.  She said, "You don't understand.  If you get off the train in Columbia, South Carolina and the shirt that says, I like Ike, you might get killed before you leave the station," and that's when she started to explain to me that there were white people who were very terrified that black people might do well, might think well, might be independent and that they would try to kill you if you were.  That sticks out in my mind 'cause that's my first memory.  Others stick out in my mind.  One of my others is, my first contact with the University of South Carolina [Columbia, South Carolina] was not a positive contact.  We were coming from band practice with, we had moved from Wheeler Hill [Columbia, South Carolina] closer to another area closer to what was called Roosevelt Village [Columbia, South Carolina], and some of us were leaving band practice, cutting through Carolina's campus to go catch the city bus and a university spokes- policeman physically kicked us off campus.  Let us understand that the public streets were all right, but that the grass between the streets and between the building was Carolina property and he said, "I do not want to see your black asses around here again unless you got on green maintenance suits."  You know, he made it very plain that black people were not welcome at the University of South Carolina.  Those two stand out and, you know, growing up in the South, you accumulate a few of those little memories along the way.  At that time, that was just a given and you had other strange things happen.
Story_ID: 571826
Speaker 1: So you graduate from University of South Carolina [Columbia, South Carolina] in '73 [1973]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, graduated in '73 [1973] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, so tell me what happens next.
Speaker 2: Oh, first I'm getting married.
Speaker 1: When did you meet your wife?
Speaker 2: I met my wife not long after I transferred to Carolina.  Blind date.  She was attending Columbia College, which is a private girls school in Columbia [South Carolina] and met this lady and very attractive, very thoughtful, found out that she had a brain that matched her beauty and we talked and chatted and dated and talked and chatted and dated and thirty-three years later, we're still talking and chatting and still married.  But met her then, got married about three months after school, went through some professional growth as I went, I left Car- when I left Carolina, my first job was as an adult eligibility worker with what was in the South Carolina Department of Public Welfare, now it's the Department of Social Services [South Carolina Department of Social Services] and--
Speaker 1: Before you go there, tell me your wife's name?
Speaker 2: Mary [Mary Bright Darby].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Maiden name is Bright.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The humor that goes with that is that when we were expecting both of our sons, every wag in town said, "Ah, Mary and Joseph, your child should be named Jesus Christ," so both of them have J.C. initials.  We have a Jason Christopher [Jason Darby] and a Jeremy Christian [Jeremy Darby].
Speaker 1: That's good.
Story_ID: 571827
Speaker 1: But anyway, where were we, the employment piece (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) All right, so tell me your first job again?
Speaker 1: Adult eligibility work at South Carolina Department of Public Welfare [South Carolina Department of Social Services].  I lasted there all of three months because first, because I didn't particularly like the work, it was all statistical.  To me, that's not what social work was supposed to be about.  Even though you were helping people to qualify for their benefits, I wanted to do something a wee bit more hands on.  It also didn't help that this was long ago that I was among the first male social workers hired by the Department of Public Welfare, not just black male, but male and most of the co-workers were female, it was just at the point where they were starting to encourage men to work in that agency and that was not a good fit.  I left there and I worked, oh, for, at least a couple of years for job service which was then the Employment Security Commission [South Carolina Department of Employment and Workforce].  I worked as an employment counselor in what was called the Youth Opportunity Center [Charleston, South Carolina], helping young people who were coming for jobs from about sixteen through twenty-one that had issues of employability, to settle those issues out, to get the right referrals, or training or whatever so that they could be gainfully employed so that they could go back into the market and go to just a regular employment person rather than an employment counselor.  I liked that a lot better.  That was more hands-on, I felt that I was making more of a difference and probably would have been there longer than a couple of years had not the job I really wanted to do at that time opened up.  That job was at the Family Court of Richland County [South Carolina].  Had interned at Family Court when I was at Carolina [University of South Carolina, Columbia, South Carolina] as a juvenile probation counselor and it was the first time that I could truly say that I felt like I was doing something that was my calling.  I can see an immediate difference I was making in the lives of young people.  It was where I got an appreciation for the law and started to get the saying that maybe I will be a lawyer and that maybe this really is the course for me.  I stayed with that agency through probably about thirteen years, I guess.
Speaker 2: Tell me what year you started there?
Speaker 1: Seventy-three [1973], '74 [1974], '75 [1975], seventy--it would have been in about seventy--1977, I think, probably.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Oh, a little earlier than that, 1975, I think, probably, yeah, probably late 1975.
Story_ID: 571828
Speaker 1: We got to 1975, but we didn't talk about the Vietnam War at all.  Tell me about your years that you could have been in service.  What happened with that (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The--thankfully I wasn't in service.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The Vietnam War was kind of the bear hiding behind the door all of the time that I was in high school and in college.  I didn't lose anyone from my high school class.  A couple of the guys in the class ahead of me were killed in Vietnam.  I still have memories of how that news got back to Booker Washington [Booker T. Washington High School, Columbia, South Carolina].  It just kind of devastated the whole school family that these guys who were, who seemed to have so much promise were gone at such an early age for such a strange cause.  It was on the mind of every male in America of my age in the late '60s [1960s], early '70s [1970s], what you gonna do?  For much of that time, I had, after I registered, what was called a 2-S deferment.  2-S meant that you were a full-time college student and there's some folk who hung tenaciously to being full-time college students in those days.  When I graduated, my status had been changed to 1-H which basically meant not eligible for service at this time because there was no longer a time of war.  That's when Vietnam had started to settle itself out.  My backup plan, if I had ever gotten drafted, was to immediately volunteer to go into the [U.S.] Navy--into the Navy or into the [U.S.] Air Force school of music, be a part of the military band program and make it like that.  I did a year of ROTC [Reserve Officers' Training Corps] at South Carolina State [South Carolina State College; South Carolina State University, Orangeburg, South Carolina] realized I would have made a terrible [U.S.] Army officer and got somebody killed.  So, I didn't pursue that any further but it was, it was a war that, that was interesting to watch as it evolved because, you know, it, it, black folk, particularly our southern black folk, tend to be very hawkish.  And so, early on, there was great support for that war and great criticism of anybody who was avoiding that war unless it happened to be your child, someone that was kin to you.  There was great criticism of those avoiding that war but as it went on, there got to be more and more question about, why are we fighting over there and more so, why are we fighting over there when we've got these problems over here and, and so it went from being the war that people tried to embrace like they had embraced most other American wars to the poster war for cynicism and, and I think that still effects the way that the present conflict in the Persian Gulf is seen and why there was such a ready shift to cynicism this time.  It didn't take as long for that sea change, sea change to take place.
Story_ID: 571829
Speaker 1: Tell me, are there any stories about while you're working at the Family Court [Columbia, South Carolina]?  You're there thirteen years, you say?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, I have stories from every job.  My favorite story from DS--Department of Public Welfare [South Carolina Department of Public Welfare], now DSS [South Carolina Department of Social Services], whether you're talking about the vagaries of race in South Carolina, some very nice old white lady called because her aid check had been cut off, and she got thrown into my caseload and I was talking to her on the phone.  I never met the lady face to face, I was talking to her on the phone, just gathering the information so we can see what happened to her aid and I asked her for her address and she told me her address and she said, "You know, it's, it's on Elmwood Park [Columbia, South Carolina]."  I said, "Yes ma'am I know that area."  She said, "Yeah, it's a nice area but, you know, it's a lot of colored people around here now," and I said, "You know, ma'am, I have a lot of colored people in my neighborhood too."  And so we just left it at that part of, she was a little bit surprised when she saw me.  Job service, I don't know that there are as many good jobs, good, good stories about job service except that that was where I really learned how to punch the clock.  I liked the job sometimes when you really don't know whether you liked the job or not but, but really started to get into what I call a responsible work routine.  The Family Court thing was the longest running piece of full-time employment and has all kinds of nuances to it.  I started working at Family Court a couple of years before there was a change in the way they did juvenile justice in South Carolina.  There was a book called, 'Sleeping,' no, 'Weeping in the Playtime of Others' ['Weeping in the Playtime of Others: America's Incarcerated Children,' Kenneth Wooden], that was an expose by a gentleman named Kenneth Wooden on the juvenile system in America and how it went from being very, very good to horrendous and it made a change in South Carolina.  They unified the system to where you once had every county responsible for juvenile probation and then the state agency to actually incarcerate children.  You had a unified family court system after that and that had good results and it had bad results.  Before the unified system, Richland County [South Carolina] had a very good family court system.  My caseload was fourteen and I could see kids twice a month.  After unification, my caseload went to thirty-six immediately.  It was harder to see kids every month.  That caseload continued to grow, paperwork continued to get piled on in that process and I was the one who, actually I ticked off my supervisors because I had seen how the system could work right and it infuriated me every time I looked at the fact that I was spending more time on paperwork than on people.  It infuriated me that you had to go to these little cute sensitivity session where are you from and let's play a game things, when I knew that there were kids out there who were working their way towards some shenanigan that I could be talking to if I wasn't there doing what state government wanted me to do instead so that I can improve my job.  So, I held onto that for about twelve years.  I went through the progression of the Family Court of Richland County to the South Carolina Department of Juvenile Placement and Aftercare, to the South Carolina Department of Youth Services, and I think I left just before it became the South Carolina Department of Juvenile Justice, which it is now.
Story_ID: 571830
Speaker 1: It was at that point that I went from bi-vocational ministry to full-time ministry.  I really answered the call in '76 [1976], was admitted to the conference in '76 [1976], got my first church in '77 [1977] and that was a small congregation, fifteen folks, no plumbing and really was bi-vocational until about 1985, '86 [1986].  That's when I was moved to a church that started to grow immediately and where I saw the possibility for full-time ministry, that's when I took that leap and went from bi-vocational, gave up my state job [at South Carolina Department of Juvenile Placement and Aftercare; South Carolina Department of Juvenile Justice], ate a little bologna for a while and learned really be a pastor, full-time (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay, let's go back because you gave me a sketch.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So let's go back.  You're saying bi-vocational.  What are you doing as far as the church while you're still working at your job?
Speaker 1: Pastoring the church.
Speaker 2: Okay, tell me where and the name of the church?
Speaker 1: Okay, '77 [1977] through 1980, I was pastor of Piney Grove, P-I-N-E-Y, Grove A.M.E. Church in Gaston, G-A-S-T-O-N, South Carolina [Piney Grove A.M.E. Church, Gaston, South Carolina], small rural African American community on a fringe of a larger white rural community.  That was my very first church.
Speaker 2: And how many people were in this church?
Speaker 1: Right about fifteen when I got there.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: There were about fifty, fifty-five when I left.  We were able to do some serious stuff, get water put in, add a small addition so that they'd have restrooms, kitchen space, put in heating and air and pews and piano and a few other things as well as growing the church and positioning it to where, and it's continued to grow.  Thankfully, it's a very nice church these days but my first day there was like culture shock because St. James [St. James A.M.E. Church, Columbia, South Carolina] was your basic well-equipped urban church.  I went out there and everybody was praying in the yard because they had just had the roof put on the building, but the concrete floor had just been poured and it was still wet and before they started to build a new building, they had demolished the old building.  So, the first Sunday I was there, church was outdoor church.  Second Sunday I was there, and my son [Jason Darby] was only about three years old at the time, my oldest son, had one of those diaper incidents that required water, lots of water and I asked one of the guys at the church where the restroom was and he pointed through the woods because that's where the restroom was.  So, I was there for three years.
Story_ID: 571831
Speaker 1: My second church was Pleasant Spring A.M.E. Church in Irmo, South Carolina.
Speaker 2: Pleasant Springs?
Speaker 1: Pleasant Spring in Irmo, near Lake Murray in, is that Lexington?  Yeah, that's Lexington County [South Carolina] as well.  That church was probably 150 folks maybe, a good 75 to 100 of them active, time for growth, was able to do some positive things there.  My third church was where my ministry started to, I don't know what you'd call it, take shape, take off, something.
Speaker 2: So you were at Pleasant Springs from--
Speaker 1: Eighty [1980] to--
Speaker 2: Nineteen eighty [1980] to--
Speaker 1: Eighty-five [1985].
Speaker 2: Eighty-five [1985], okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Third church was Pine Grove, no Y on that one, A.M.E., in Columbia [Pine Grove A.M.E. Church, Columbia, South Carolina].  It was really in kind of what, what was the country outside of Columbia [South Carolina] that had evolved into the suburbs and I think that was the case of being in the right place at the right time.  It was part of what the A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] church used to call, still calls even though we don't have them too much anymore, a circuit, where you had two or more churches together and they would share a pastor.  I was the first pastor the year they broke away from being a circuit, and became a stationed church, a church that just has one pastor.  It was at the same time that the church, the community around the church was changing.  St. Andrews [South Carolina], which had been, which had grown as a white suburb, suddenly started to grow as a mixed suburb and so you had an influx of fairly affluent young African Americans and Pine Grove, it was an old church but they had just enough of a progressive mindset to avail themselves of that growth and so that church went from two hundred to something like six hundred members over the time that I was there from late '85 [1985] up until '91 [1991].  It's really where there were enough people, enough resources for me to go full-time, for me to try some ideas prayerfully to see how they would work, to have a few failures and to learn maybe this one wasn't a good idea and to start the shape a pattern of ministry that, that I think has served me well, and that church is still growing and still flourishing.  They just built a new building.
Story_ID: 571832
Speaker 1: Let me understand, how do you get into the ministry in the A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] church?  You were working, you know, as a social worker, how do you become a minister in the church (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay, if you feel called to the ministry of the A.M.E. church, you go up to the altar at that time when people normally join the church, actually, when that call is extended and let the pastor know that you feel that you have been called into ministry.  Pastor then will counsel with you and arrange a time for you to talk with the officers of the church and if they approve that at the local church level, you go into what in our church is called the district level and when I was in Columbia [South Carolina], that was the Columbia district so that district conference examines you and then it sends you to the next level which is the conference level, for us it was the Columbia annual conference and if you touch bases as they're supposed to be touched, there's instruction to prepare you to enter the conference.  You then enter the conference, you're admitted on trial, it's called, to the conference.  After two years and with meeting of the education requirements, you're ordained a deacon.  A deacon in the A.M.E. church is actually an order of ministry, it's when you're able to be called reverend, it's when you're able to do weddings, funerals, baptisms, and consecrate the Lord--not consecrate, aid in the distribution of the Lord's Supper (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Lord's Supper, okay.
Speaker 2: A couple of more years and with the right educational qualification, you are then ordained as an elder which is a full ordination that allows you also to consecrate the Lord's Supper, and that's a process that I went through.  The nature of the church has been that you don't quit your job when you enter the ministry because we simply do not have an abundance of full-time churches.  Still, the denomination does not have a mechanism to supplement salary for clergy whose congregations cannot pay them.  So you have a good percentage of clergy who both pastor full-time, really, but also have another job in the secular world to, to meet ends meet.  That was the case for me for the first years of my ministry.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And the way that we get from church to church is that bishops send us there.  They--we are assigned pretty much for a year at a time by whoever is the presiding bishop in our geographic unity in our Episcopal district.
Speaker 1: Okay, so they make the decision when it's time for you to leave--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --each church.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: If you want to go, that's tough.  If people want you out the door real badly, that's still tough.  If they don't want you to go, that's tough, bishops move you.
Story_ID: 571833
Speaker 1: Nineteen ninety-one [1991] I was moved from Pine Grove [Pine Grove A.M.E. Church, Columbia, South Carolina] to St. Phillip A.M.E. [St. Philip A.M.E. Church] in Eastover, South Carolina.
Speaker 2: St. Philips.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Phillip, no S on it, St. Phillip A.M.E. in Eastover, the same little community where my [maternal] grandfather [Jackson Janerette] was born and pastors and folk, we had a laugh with about how we don't know what happened to slavery because the spelling of my mother's family name, as I always knew it was Janerette, J-A-N.  There was some folk down there who're obviously kin, but their spelling was Jenerette, J-E-N-E-R-E-T-T-E, but got to pastor down there and really enjoyed it.  St. Phillip was a bit larger church and even though it was in a rural area, it had a very urban mindset and most of the folk who were in that church by the time I got there worked in an urban setting and, and maintained their roots, either lived in Eastover, came into Eastover for worship and it was there that we really decided to do some strong things that that church did some strong things in the way of outreach.  Did some strong things in the way of creativity and it was there as I had settled into full-time ministry and being able to eat at the same time, so to speak, that I got involved in what I guess is called advocacy.  That's when I got involved in the ministerial alliance in Columbia [Greater Columbia Interdenominational Ministerial Alliance] in a leadership role.  That's when I was appointed to the board of our state's ecumenical agency, Christian Action Council [South Carolina Christian Action Council] in a leadership role.  That's when a few other community things all jumped off and it started to be a matter of what I did at the church but also how extended, how that church work extended into community that started to shape itself up while I was in Eastover in 1991 to 1998.
Story_ID: 571834
Speaker 1: Now, let me go back a little bit.  Do you remember your first, or did you have I should say a trial sermon?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: Do you remember it?
Speaker 2: If you were, if you were arrested for being a Christian, would there be enough evidence to convict you?  I always look at, trial sermon is something you write, you're looking at, at the time you said, "Thank you Lord" and then you put it away and you say, "How did I ever write this?" you know, as you evolve, I guess, but that was the title of the trial sermon and St. James [St. James A.M.E. Church, Columbia, South Carolina] was very kind and acted like I did a good job even though I probably (laughter) wasn't all that great.
Speaker 1: All right, okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Story_ID: 571835
Speaker 1: So, at St. Phillip [St. Phillip A.M.E. Church, Eastover, South Carolina], you talk about the outreach programs.  What were some of them that you did?
Speaker 2: Probably the best one, that's a rural area and the kids don't have a lot of activity and in some cases do not have a lot of resources.  The church got together with one of the major employers out there, Union Camp [Union Camp Corporation], and did something called, Operation Bike Repair [ph.] along with small black business in that area, ColorPro Promotions [ph.].  And Union Camp somehow acquired a whole bunch of bicycles and between Union Camp's employees, our men's group, the Sons of Allen, and ColorPro, we restored them, gave them away to kids in the community.  Some of the business people in that church took some of the kids who were beyond real summer job age, fifteen and below, from about eleven to fifteen, I guess, and did some things to prepare them for work.  They actually sat them down for seminars to talk about employability, did the role-playing on how to interview.  Talked about how to fill out the application and at the end of that process, which was a spring process, those who made the cut actually got summer jobs with businesses in the church.  The church hosted a couple of community programs in April, and I think it's something else, that, that made a link with the community.  It was those, it was trying to do things that were out of the ordinary to, to make a change in the quality of life, that's where, that really started to take place at St. Phillip.  It's where they started doing mentoring and rites of passage thing with the young men, not only of the church but of the community.  It's where the young ladies also had their own rite of passage thing that ended with their going to a very nice dinner at a very nice downtown restaurant in Columbia [South Carolina] so that they could use all of their etiquette skills that they had gotten from the church.  It was, it was a practical application of religion that said, you know, you're stuck in the middle of Eastover [South Carolina] but you still live in the world every day so your religion goes with you every day and your religion is just not a matter of hallelujah, thank you Jesus.  It's how you conduct yourself every day, that's the best way that your light shines.
Story_ID: 571836
Speaker 1: --About, do we really need to have denominations and you were going to respond.
Speaker 2: In a perfect world, where everybody lays aside every human consideration, stands on purely spiritual ground and takes seriously when Paul says about us being, of having one Lord, being of one faith and having one baptism, you probably wouldn't need a single denomination.  In a real world, before you even talk about Baptist, Methodist and Pentecostals coming together, you got the A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] church, the A.M.E. Zion church, C.M.E. [Christian Methodist Episcopal] church and we can't even agree to merge, you know.  And it doesn't come down to arguments of doctrinal polity, we can agree on that kind of thing, but you're talking about merging three branches of bishops, you're talking about merging three publishing operations, you're talking about three different sets of general officers, three missionary societies and working out the human vagaries of all of that, always causes there to be some kind of breakdown.  I think the better hope is for means of collaboration in spite of and across denominational lines.  One of the best things I was ever involved in and I really hope it gets revitalized or something that one of our bishops, John Hurst Adams [HistoryMaker Bishop John Hurst Adams], put together called the, Congress of National Black Churches, and it was a way that the three major Methodist denominations, the four major black Baptist conventions in the Church of God in Christ and I think they were talking Bible Way churches as well and it kind of went dormant, could come across lives, we'd meet together, study together, work together, take action together, agreeing to disagree on whatever were our points of disagreement we're pushing those things way off into the corner so that we could all focus and go together to help towards the common goal.  I think that's probably as close as you're going to come until Jesus comes again.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Okay.
Speaker 2: And then you're still going to have some folk who wonder about whether there's going to be a Methodist heaven or Baptist heaven.
Speaker 1: You're right.
Story_ID: 571837
Speaker 1: So in 1998, you leave St. Phillip [St. Phillip A.M.E. Church, Eastover, South Carolina] and what happens next?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Nineteen ninety-eight [1998], December 1st, 1998, was sitting in the parsonage at St. Phillip, and St. Phillip is a rural town and, and one of the things I fussed about from '91 [1991] to '98 [1998], not with the church but with the local cable provider, was that they did not treat this little black town right.  They never upgraded the system.  You can only get thirteen piddling channels, while you knew folk around you were pulling in satellite stuff from Venus, probably.  They could never explain to me the sense of having country music TV [CMT], Nashville [Tennessee] network, in a town where there were almost, literally, no white people, but they didn't have BET [Black Entertainment Television].  So I argued with the board and the crew over there and cajoled and nagged until finally they ran fiber optic cable as far as Eastover [South Carolina] and they got it together on December 1st so that December 1st, 1998, fiber--we celebrated the advent of fiber optic cable at the parsonage in St. Phillip.  I was sitting there, brother had just installed the box, I was flipping through channels in wonder, my phone rang, [HistoryMaker] Bishop John Hurst Adams called and said, "Pack your bags, you're moving to Charleston [South Carolina]."  I said, "But Bishop, I just got my cable."  After we got through laughing about it, moaning about that, I was assigned here and I did not, I did not ever expect to be at Morris Brown [Morris Brown African Methodist Episcopal Church, Charleston, South Carolina].  Morris Brown is very literally what's called our first church.  It means that it's our largest congregation in South Carolina and when I asked Bishop, 'cause bishops will not always tell you where they're going to send you, I asked him, I said, "Well Bishop, when, I'm moving, where?"  He didn't say Charleston first.  He said, "Pack your bags, you're moving," and I said, "I'm moving, where?"  And he said, "To the first church."  And I said, "What about Ronnie?"  Ronnie Brailsford [Ronnie Elijah Brailsford, Sr.] was the pastor of Bethel A.M.E. [Bethel A.M.E. Church, Columbia, South Carolina], that's the first church of the Columbia conference and I thought, Ronnie just got there a couple of years ago, bishop can't be moving him already.  He said, "No, I'm not sending you to that first church, I'm sending you to the first church, Morris Brown."  And so I had to get over the shock.  My wife [Mary Bright Darby] had to get over the shock.  We had a talk about how we would do because she was still teaching in that area and my sons [Jason Darby and Jeremy Darby] were still in school in that area, at least one of them was, the eldest was in college by then, and we figured it all out.  December 5th, 1998, I was assigned to Morris Brown A.M.E. Church and have enjoyed myself here ever since, all of the trials, all of the triumphs, I've enjoyed every last bit of them.
Story_ID: 571838
Speaker 1: We need to talk about the trials and (laughter)--
Speaker 2: The trials and--
Speaker 1: You know I'm not going to let you get off that easy.  Morris Brown [Morris Brown African Methodist Episcopal Church, Charleston, South Carolina], tell me why Morris Brown?  Why was this church named Morris Brown and the first church?
Speaker 2: That story goes back to the beginnings of the A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] church in South Carolina.  The A.M.E. church in South Carolina actually, almost goes back to the beginnings of the A.M.E. church as a whole.  Allen [Richard Allen] and his crew in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], when they established the church, walked out in 1787, they built the first building, Bethel [Mother Bethel A.M.E. Church, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], in 1796, a number of those congregations, of like mind, came together in 1816 to form the denomination.  There was actually an A.M.E. congregation established in Charleston [South Carolina] in 1818 by a gentleman named Morris Brown.  He was the founding pastor of that congregation in the antebellum South.  That congregation grew to a membership of thousands in a very short time which made some folk very uneasy.  That uneasiness overflowed because one of the lay clergy, lay, what we call local preachers, I think some churches call them clergy lay speakers, but one of those folks in that congregation was a man by the name of Denmark Vesey who planned a slave rebellion, 1822, '23 [1823], that was discovered and crushed Vesey and those that were seen as his conspirators were killed.  Morris Brown had to flee for his life, leave his property, that congregation which went underground behind, and he went to Philadelphia, hooked up with Allen, actually became the second elected and consecrated bishop of the A.M.E. church after Richard Allen.  In 1865, after the Civil War, when another A.M.E. bishop was also born in South Carolina, who also had to flee for his life because he was teaching black children by the name of Daniel Payne, came back south, he re-established the A.M.E. Church in South Carolina, first in Beaufort [South Carolina] at a little church called, Queen Chapel [Queen Chapel A.M.E. Church, Hilton Head Island, South Carolina], then came back to Charleston, reactivated that congregation which had been worshiping underground, that became what is now Mother Emanuel A.M.E. Church [Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church, Charleston, South Carolina].  It's like the denominational mother church for the southeastern United States.  It also immediately grew so fast that there was a need for a second congregation so they came a few blocks over here.  Richard Cain [Richard Harvey Cain], who was the founding pastor of Emanuel, then became the founding pastor of this church and it was agreed to name it for Morris Brown, the pastor who established the first A.M.E. church in South Carolina.  So, that's how we get to be in Morris Brown A.M.E. Church today.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 571839
Speaker 1: So when you get here [Morris Brown African Methodist Episcopal Church, Charleston, South Carolina], what is the congregation like?
Speaker 2: It's a wonderful group of people.  It is an old church, it's an established church and it is a, it is a prototypical old established church congregation.  That means that you've got a marvelous mix of people.  That means that you've got some new heads who want to do new things, new ideas, new ways.  It also means that you have some old heads who believe that however Richard Harvey Cain did it in 1866, is the way it ought to be done in 2007 and so they are slow to change, slow to move forward and, and will hold to traditions.  And so pastoring a church like this has been a marvelous and joyous act to walking on a tightrope, to be able to respect those traditions, which do need to be respected and build upon them while at the same time serving the needs of the year 2007 so--and building the congregation and work with the church growth in 2007 and making sure that the church has a viable community witness in 2007.
Speaker 1: Okay, you have a deacon board here?
Speaker 2: Actually, what we call it in the A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] church is a board of stewards.  They would be the equivalent of a board of deacons in the Baptist church.
Speaker 1: Okay, and so the church is, well let me ask you.  Are you the head of the church, like all decisions are made through you and then you have to go through a board that's somewhere else (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well the way it works, that, this is the two-minute church governance lesson.  There are two basic ways a church is governed, one is congregational and one is connectional.  Baptist churches for the most part are congregational.  They are in loose amalgams of associations, unions, conventions, whatever, but the basic governance lies at the congregational level.  The congregation makes its rules.  A congregation puts in policies and procedures.  A congregation in most cases hires a pastor and that pastor is there as long as it's mutually agreeable and then that pastor is gone.  A.M.E. church is a connectional church which means that we have layers of government which means that a good portion of our rules of operation are set forth in a book of positive law called, 'The Book of Discipline' ['The Doctrines and Discipline of the African Methodist Episcopal Church'], every four years and it means too that pastors are assigned rather than being called to A.M.E. churches.  Because of that, we have a lot more latitude as far as governance goes.  And so, I have authority that I don't always exercise, you know.  As pastor, I almost nominate or appoint everyone in a position of leadership in an A.M.E. church.  I nominate stewards who are then always confirmed per nominations, at quarterly conference.  Our trustees are elected by the congregation but they are elected after I nominate twice the number to be elected.  Congregational nominations cannot be made.  I appoint class leaders.  I have the authority, even though I don't do it, to appoint auxiliary chairs.  I appoint Christian head leadership.  I'm the chairman ex officio of the lead bodies of the church.  I preside at meetings of the church.  If a board meeting of the church does something that I think is in a bad interest of the church, I have the authority to veto it and then just as it happens in Washington [D.C.], they have to come up with a two-thirds majority to override my veto and, you know, the challenge with that is something that one of my uncles said, "It's not a question as to whether you have authority in the A.M.E. church.  The question is, are you Christian enough to exercise your authority in the appropriate way?"  And so, the way the church is structured, that's what we hopefully try to do, exercise that pastoral authority in an appropriate way.  I also, one of the hats I wear is teaching folks coming into ministry now, and I always remind them that the Lord has called them to be shepherds.  The Lord has not called them to be cowboys, there's a difference.  Shepherds guide and nurture the flock, cowboys drive the herd and cowboys don't last too long in pulpits either.
Story_ID: 571840
Speaker 1: We talked earlier, and you were saying there were three components and the church is really the only one that's left.  What outreach programs are available here for the community (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh my goodness.  Let's see what all we do.  One of the things we do, because we are a large church [Morris Brown African Methodist Episcopal Church, Charleston, South Carolina], with facilities, is host some things in the area--in the community, free of charge.  We host monthly NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] meetings, we host a substance abuse group, an AA [Alcoholics Anonymous] group.  We host a group called, Second Chance [Second Chance Recovery, Inc., Charleston, South Carolina], for folk who have run afoul of the law with drugs and are trying to recover.  We host a parenting group for fathers who are behind in their child support and trying to get that right.  We host a group for homicide survivors.  We host an Alzheimer's support group and the congregation has a link into all of those things.  There are some things as well that are exclusive to the church.  We do feeding at a couple of the community ministries, crisis ministry, and one of the other ones that escapes my name right now, on a monthly basis.  We do mentoring at Burke High School [Charleston, South Carolina].  We've adopted two of the community elementary schools and, and provide them, hopefully, with volunteers, as well as, own, in-kind contributions.  We have a computer literacy class that is free for grown folk who are terrified of the computer so that they can learn to maneuver in this age of technology.  We have a tutorial mentoring program for the kids, free, that provides after school care as well as after school instruction, as well as those little lessons in civics and in government to help them to be responsible citizens.  We do that during the summer in what's called, a summer enrichment program that ends with them taking a trip somewhere in South Carolina, on the site of historical intellectual significance.  We are about to kick off that same program that I told you about with the young ladies, that rite of passage program.  We do a bunch of stuff.
Story_ID: 571841
Speaker 1: Well let me ask you this, because I know it's kind of, it's hard for the church, but I just want to get your opinion or your thoughts on why it is that the church is not involved so much in helping people understand about the AIDS [acquired immunodeficiency syndrome] epidemic?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Now you're going to launch me up on a long reflect.  I think because the church very often reflects a community.  One of the blessed and annoying things about churches is that they're filled with human beings and those things that human beings take time coming up to speed on, churches take time coming up with speed on, I think that's been true with the AIDS and HIV [human immunodeficiency virus] epidemic for a couple of reasons.  One of those is that even though the church is a place of healing, if we're not careful, the church becomes a place for perpetuating taboos.  Tuberculosis is in my lifetime.  I remember when, if someone had tuberculosis, they were not given treatment in the community, they were sent into isolation, they were sent to a TB camp on the fringe of a city so that they wouldn't be around anybody else and get this dreaded disease.  Burning the clothing of people who have cancer is in my memory and I remember when someone had cancer in church, they would not say that, you know, it had to be something other than that because that was a taboo disease of its time.  HIV/AIDS has become the taboo disease of our time and that label is sticking so that, you know, it's been around since the '80s [1980s], I've been, that, it's been more than fifteen years, I have not past- preached one single funeral where someone in the family said the deceased died of AIDS or HIV.  I've preached pneumonia funerals, I've preached Kaposi sarcoma funerals, I've preached kidney failure funerals, I've preached liver failure fu- I've preached funerals of those who were HIV positive, who had full blown AIDS who died from the ravages of the disease but their families could not bring themselves to say, this person had AIDS.  That's a part of it because those families make up the church and a part of it is because the early taboo was that this is the gay people's disease and so if you're getting this, oh my Lord, you must be fooling with the gay people, you might even be gay yourself.  Now, there's something a little bit stupid about that and the church sometimes will operate not on a level of sanctification but of stupidity.  The people buy into the stereotype and because of that they don't help and I have seen that play out into the church, you know, to where people get all worked up about gays and I've never pastored a church that didn't have somebody gay in it and where a good piece of the congregation didn't know exactly who was gay.  It just simply wasn't an issue but, but people get worked up when they want to get worked up and I think that's what, if that makes sense, makes it hard for the church to handle that still.  People still try to view it with that taboo and because of that, people tend to tread lightly around it.

Speaker 1: I have had difficulty, really, getting there to be much beyond what's done by a very good group called Balm in Gilead [The Balm in Gilead, Inc.], and that's the AIDS Sunday.  There's only one, the black church that I know that has best addressed AIDS/HIV [acquired immunodeficiency syndrome/human immunodeficiency virus], is a church in Columbia [South Carolina], Brookland Baptist [Brookland Baptist Church], and that church was able to address it because on a Sunday morning one of their assistant clergy got up and said, "I'm gay and I think I'm HIV positive," and that put it so that the church had no option but to confront it.  At that point in time, they started to put together care teams, they started to put together support groups and they've got a viable ministry.  We had a viable ministry but it kind of took a good brother by the name of Harry Kendrick to make that thing flow because Harry was HIV positive.  As a matter of fact, Harry had AIDS and thankfully is still doing pretty good because he was blessed to be, come along at the time when the medicine, the technology had moved to the point it was no longer an immediate death sentence and we had a good ministry when Harry was here [Morris Brown African Methodist Episcopal Church, Charleston, South Carolina] because Harry took it on with a passion.  If there was nobody but him that was involved, he took it on with a pas- used to tick off the local agencies because they would do, and compete for the grant dollars to do, what Harry did free, you know, the context, the instruction, the education, the outreach, the counseling, he did all of that stuff and he's still doing it in Atlanta [Georgia], I think, through what he's, what's now evolved into an organization but for the black church to tackle that, just as it's true for so many problems, you almost have to have someone who will be a point person with a passion to be able to get in there to do something and I don't think that's happened in a lot of churches.
Speaker 2: Well that's true but I don't see the churches, giving the education to dispel the myth because African Americans are the highest at-risk group and females and women, you know, are the largest group but there's no education and I think the education is the important part of it.  Is there still education being given in your church (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, now we do do the educational component, both locally and in through our youth group that goes up a couple of levels in the A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] church, YPD [Young People's Division].  There is HIV, it is education particularly for young people, trying to structure so that that applies more even to young adults to those folk who I think need that education the most, but the educational piece we are doing.  It's the confrontational piece, it's the affirmation piece, it's the getting people to say, "I've got somebody in my family who's HIV positive, who has AIDS," that's still the challenge and, and I think my suspicion is we still have miles to go before we get there.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Okay.
Story_ID: 571843
Speaker 1: You talked some about prosperity preachers.
Speaker 2: Ah, yes.
Speaker 1: Now let's talk about what's going on as far as people being able to learn how to, with their credit, what to do, home ownership, that type of thing.  Is that, okay, tell me what you, what you mean by prosperity (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Prosperity preachers.
Speaker 1: --um-hm, because is that not a part of some of the things that--
Speaker 2: Oh, definitely.
Speaker 1: --the church should do is teach people--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --how to maneuver their funds and be good students?
Speaker 2: Yeah, and we do home ownership classes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They did to me.  Prosperity should be a natural part of tithing in stewardship.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I don't believe that there is a prescription from the Lord that anybody is supposed to be poor.  I think that that ought to be done, and as a congregation, as a part of what we do in stewardship instruction in Christian, in that aspect of Christian education, a piece of that is, how do you manage your money?  A piece of that is how do you invest your money?  A piece of that is, how do you keep yourself creditworthy so that you can do what you need to do?  But the piece of that that goes beyond that is that to whom much is given, much is required (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Required.
Speaker 2: And that is more than throwing money.  Part of the problem that I have, sometimes, with some of those who preach prosperity to gospel, not all, but some of those who preach prosperity to gospel, is that the lean goes towards throwing money.  The message gets to be God wants you to prosper.  I've got a colleague in town [Charleston, South Carolina] who has that message right now, God wants you to prosper and be rich and when God gets you there, hallelujah, you are a blessed child.  There's nothing in that message about the fact that there are some people who are not rich.  There's nothing in that message that, about what used to be called Maslow's, what is it, Maslow's hierarchy of needs that before you're ready for a message of self-actualization or self-identity, you might first want something to eat, something to drink, something basic and, and the thing that if we're not careful we leave out of that is, you know, when Jesus said, "Whatever you have done for the least of these, you've done for me."  So the prosperity is not the problem for me.  The problem for me is that if the focus gets to be so much on the prosperity that you forget to change lives along the way for those who have a long road to get to before they even, are able to hear about prosperity and to do it in a way that's a hands-on manner.  I'm bothered when the church throws money at problems, you know, and so it's one thing to open up a halfway house.  It's one thing to give big money towards social programs.  It's something else to actually have members of the church who hear that message get in there, touch people one on one and start to change their lives and that's what I think is greatly needed.  First church I pastored, Piney Grove [Piney Grove A.M.E. Church, Gaston, South Carolina], I'm just fresh and new and I knew I had all of the answers and we were going to go out and walk the community and evangelize and fill up that little church and I told them, you know what we're going to tell 'em, we're going to tell everybody we meet, "Jesus loves you."  That was going to be the lead in.  I bopped up to the first door 'cause I was a fresh, new, young pastor and brother opened the door and we opened the door, I said, "Hey, I'm Joe Darby [HistoryMaker Reverend Joseph Darby], I'm pastor of Piney Grove and I want you to know, Jesus loves you" and he said, "Oh, yeah, well if Jesus loves me, how come my lights off and my wife just left?"  Now that threw Jesus loves you into a different gear because that was a very good question and that meant we had to go in.  That meant we had to talk to him.  That meant we had to talk about some issues of credit and some greater issues of addiction and some issues of abuse to get him to where he was ready for Jesus loves you and, you know, I think sometimes if we're not careful, we get full to the level of they can grow rich before they get to the level of love the Lord and reach out to others, that's my prosperity gospel problem.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Story_ID: 571844
Speaker 1: That, plus the fact, and, and it goes to what I think is one of the crucial roles of the historical African American church today, because it's that last bastion of community values, it ought to be a community voice of advocacy.  I can say some things that I know some of the folk in this congregation [at Morris Brown African Methodist Episcopal Church, Charleston, South Carolina] agree with but cannot say because they've got to eat, you know, and wherever they work, but they say might be frowned upon even in the year 2007.  I'm paid by a few thousand black folk, most of whom agree with me on, at least generally, on issues of advocacy.  So, if I get out and shoot off my mouth, then it's not a matter of, "We're going to fire you because we don't like what you're saying and speaking truth to power."  Too often today we don't speak truth to power as a historically African American church.  Too often today, we try to separate that gospel out so much that we become sanitized and emasculated and it's held nicely in the walls and within the programs of the church but it doesn't touch somebody out there who needs not to hear from, from Micaiah if it's inside the house is making sure that there's a lid on everything but who needs to hear from an Ezekiel, who needs to hear from an Isaiah to say, "This world ain't right, this is God's world, this world ain't right, a lot of y'all talking about God ain't right either, we need to fix that."  And the church, I think, still needs to do that.  That doesn't happen enough today.
Story_ID: 571845
Speaker 1: Preachers like, well, when I think of prosperity preachers or healing preachers or people like, say Reverend Ike [Frederick J. Eikerenkoetter II], because everybody, you know, everybody knows Reverend Ike, you know--
Speaker 2: He's a prototype, yeah.
Speaker 1: There, there are few that's like that, also, especially on Christian television, you know.  Send your money, send your money, because God is going to, to bless you as though a blessing comes from a dollar.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Can you, can you speak to some of that type of thing?
Speaker 2: Of that kind of mindset?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Everybody who pimps does not work the street (laughter).  That's probably the kindest thing I can say.  I think that there's a special danger in pimping religion and I think to a degree that's what some people do, to even, I think, sometimes well-intentioned people.  If they take their focus off of what the Lord originally called them to do, it's very easy when you are labeled as reverend, when you get to stand up there at a little height higher than everybody else, where at least somebody thinks that you're doing a good job and they don't mind telling you how wonderful you are.  It's very easy if we're not careful to hear all of that and say, "You know they're right, I'm just as wonderful as they say I am," and to act accordingly.  When you do that, then you can more freely try to do things your way than God's way.  When you do that, then you can more freely try to make some ridiculous appeals for time or money or energy and some of those ridiculous appeals that get made on TV, amazing, and, and the amazing thing is that pimps have good business that those folk who do that have folk who follow them.  The first church I pastored [Piney Grove A.M.E. Church, Gaston, South Carolina], again, there used to be a gentleman in South Carolina--
Story_ID: 571846
Speaker 1: You were going to tell me your (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, I was going to tell you about the first church I pastored.  There was a guy who was, billed himself as an evangelist and his very strong appeal was to get every dollar he could get in his camp, and southern, very southern, very white, the main folk who followed his evangelism were black and he's, I don't know what his status is today.  He kind of fell from favor, because he tried to put a hit out on a highway patrolman, state trooper who had either ticketed him or ticketed his son and they took a dim view of an assassination attempt but it amazed me when I was at Piney Grove [Piney Grove A.M.E. Church, Gaston, South Carolina] because I had a few little ladies who were very faithful to his ministry.  These ladies would come to Piney Grove, put five bucks [dollars] a week in the plate, faithfully, you know.  They would then go to one of his big revival things, drop a hundred bucks a head in there, faithfully, and I asked them one time, you know, "Why don't you tithe at home?"  And they said, "'Cause we don't know what you're going to do with that money."  I said, "What do you think he's--?"  "Oh, he's going to use it right, we just know he's going to use it right."  So, you know, there are pimps and pimps have followings.  It's amazing.
Speaker 1: I think that's, that's true.  With that thought, does the church actually teach people what the money is used for as far as tithes are used for this and offerings are used for this and, and, you know, is that part of the educational, you know, intake, when they come into the church?
Speaker 2: It is, or at least here it is.  It ought to be in every church but at least here it is.  I think that one of the things the church needs to be set, needs to be sensitive to, is for the need for clarity and the need for transparency.  That's why over the years I've developed some things.  I don't sign checks.  I have the ability to but I don't sign checks, I don't write checks.  Anything that goes through here, goes with a voucher.  First of the year, we do a budget.  That budget is published and put into the hands of every member of the church [Morris Brown African Methodist Episcopal Church, Charleston, South Carolina], along with some other information in the church handbook, so that they'll know what the appeal is for and what the church is trying to do.  The expenditures are made known to the church on a quarterly basis so they'll know what the church is trying to do, because, you know, and in essence, we give as, as an act, as a tangible act of thanks to God.  That is why we tithe, that's why we are good stewards but if we are to be good stewards of that which is given, then we ought be responsible enough in turn to account for, to give an account of our stewardship, you know.  There's a story in scripture where Jesus tells of a man who gives what are called talents, measures of money in the, in the times of the ancient Near East, New Testament times, and he gives each one a certain number and two of the guys double theirs.  One guy's greedy and stingy and jealous and he just buries his, but that which is given he doesn't just say, "Okay, here's yours and have a good life."  He comes back later on to check on them to see what they have done with what they been given.  And so, I think that when we have been given time, energy, money, talent, whatever it is because I think we're supposed to tithe all of those things, you know, we owe the Lord two point four hours a day if we get very technical about it that we then have to account for that in some reasonable way.  All churches don't do that but I think that it makes for a more open, a more positive and a more clear environment when we know exactly what's being done and how it's done, how it's being done.  At least make it available 'cause some folk don't care one way or another to know (laughter), but at least make it available.
Story_ID: 571847
Speaker 1: Well do you think that churches or people in the congregations will ever get to a point where giving, will they understand that giving, you give unto the Lord and not unto man so therefore it doesn't really matter (laughter)?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I think that'll probably happen when Jesus comes again, too. People get stuck sometimes on, on the why of giving and I've been blessed to pastor one church that went a long way towards tithing, the church in Eastover [St. Philip A.M.E. Church, Eastover, South Carolina], and because they did, marvelous things happened.  They don't have all of those little rallies where you invite folk in to sing and they bring you money so they can invite you back and you give them their money back.  They have women's day, men's day, there's no dollar tab on it, there's just the celebration.  They actively tithe, they pay the bills by tithing, put a cap on the, on the central treasury and everything above the cap, which really comes by tithing, goes into an investment instrument so that when they need to do something big, they don't have to take out a loan.  That's the only church I've really seen work like that.  Nine times out of ten people figure, "I've gotta give 'cause we've gotta keep the lights on but if I give more than what I need to keep the lights on, I don't know what they're going to do with that.  Now they say they're spending it the right way but I don't know if they're spending it the right way.  They didn't give me the re- ."  Even if the report's sitting in front of them on a desk, "I have no idea whatsoever they're doing with it," or sometimes it gets to be, in some churches, "I don't like that preacher, that preacher's going to get that money, I'm going to withhold that and I'll show him, I'll show her," not understanding that when we give, we worship the Lord through our giving.  One of my picky points is I very, very, very seldom talk dollars and cents from the pulpit.  I very, very, very seldom say, you all need to give this, you all need to give that unless it's an extremely special rally or if I've been asked to do a commission on stewardship and finance, other than that, when the time comes for offering at Morris Brown [Morris Brown African Methodist Episcopal Church, Charleston, South Carolina], we bow our heads, we pray, we thank the Lord for the Lord's goodness and grace towards us and then pray that God will direct us in the giving of our tithes and our offering so that we might say, thank you in a tangible way, that's why we give, to say thank you in a tangible way.

Speaker 1: We're here at Morris Brown [Morris Brown African Methodist Episcopal Church, Charleston, South Carolina] and you've been here, how long now?
Speaker 2: I am in my ninth year.
Speaker 1: Ninth year.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Is it possible that you would be assigned to another church?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, that's possible tomorrow.  We're movable on very short notice, actually.  A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] pastors typically stay for a year at a time.  We are reassigned annually, so I'm on my ninth year.  I've actually been appointed eight year--eight times in a row so that's how I get to be on my ninth year but we can be moved at any time and normally, as long as we're doing a reasonably good job, then we are either left alone or we're promoted.  There are some occasions when people aspire to high office because of the nature of our church, then we've got a middle management level called, presiding elders.  We've got an executive thing, bishops, general officers, you have to stand for election to those kinds of offices.  So, you know, maybe one of these days I'll lose my mind and run for bishop, something like that, but right now, I'm very contented to be pastor of Morris Brown.
Story_ID: 571849
Speaker 1: Are there any women ministers in the church?
Speaker 2: In this one [Morris Brown African Methodist Episcopal Church, Charleston, South Carolina], two, yeah, and very good, very effective, both of the sisters.
Speaker 1: So is this something new?  Were women always accepted into the ministry, this ministry, A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal]?
Speaker 2: In the A.M.E.?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: It was still a rarity when I came aboard, actually.  I think, '72 [1972], '68 [1968], one of those two years that's when they officially acknowledged women as assignable to pastor, which has not been that long ago, really.  From the beginnings, they have been preaching women.  One of Richard Allen's contemporaries was a lady named Jarena Lee and she was never given her due but Allen would quietly say that she was one of the greatest preachers that he had ever heard.  In the A.M.E. church, since women have really been in ministry, it's been interesting.  It's been a joy to see them grow.  We've got, one, two, three women now who are bishops in the church, as a matter of fact, and were elected as regular bishops which was a major argument when the first one was elected, Vashti McKenzie [HistoryMaker Bishop Vashti McKenzie].  When Vashti was elected, the church wanted to pass a special resolution that year to say one of the bishop's elected this year will be a woman.  Vashti and other folks fought against it and said, no, it should just be a bishop and, bless her heart, she pulled it off, and she was, and two other sisters, Carolyn Guidry [HistoryMaker Bishop Carolyn Tyler Guidry] and Sarah Davis have done that since she did.  We started to have some women who were presiding elders, Roz Coleman [Rosalyn Coleman], one of them, is presiding elder north of here, in the Georgetown District.  Some women who were starting to pastor major pulpits.  There's still a prejudice against women at the church and it's a part of a very human condition.  The thing that always amuses me is that when I look sometimes and listen sometimes to how my colleagues in the A.M.E. church view women in ministry, I understand the irrationality of the way some white folk view some black folk, because I've been in settings with the brothers where they say, "We better watch them because if we don't, they going to take it over.  They try harder, they go to school," which ought to be a good thing.  "They try harder, they go to school, we got to be careful of them, they might get too uppity.  How come they always got to be off in a group by themselves?  I wonder what they're talking about?  I bet they're talking about us."  And you take away male minister, female minister and you substitute white onlooker, black person, it's the same thing, prejudice is an interesting thing.

Speaker 1: We were going to talk earlier about the caste system in Charleston [South Carolina].
Speaker 2: Oh, Lord have mercy, yup.  There's a caste system in Charleston, South Carolina.  I hope I'm still pastor of this church [Morris Brown African Methodist Episcopal Church, Charleston, South Carolina] after I say that on tape, but there is.  Charleston has a serious case of it, and I think it goes to the way that Charleston developed.  This is one of the few cities, I think, Charleston and New Orleans [Louisiana] notably, that actually had an appreciable free population of African descent before the Civil War, stable population of African descent before the Civil War, usually related by blood to planters but they were black folk, the way the law defined black folks even, they were light, bright and darn near white, they were still black folk.  And so, you had a free class there that would trace people in some cases, business owners.  You also had an urban slave class in Charleston with considerable mobility, considerable latitude for movement, as long as things didn't get stirred up, as it got stirred up in the Nat Turner era.  Then you had slaves who not only were free to come and go because they were expected to come back but also were able to make money as slaves.  All of that work wasn't just so that the money would go back to the owner but they would get some income themselves and then you had surrounding Charleston, a large population of what you think of when you think of slavery, the plantation workers.  After the Civil War, the urban free class became the upper class.  The urban slave class became the middle class and then that Sea Island population that came in, became the lower middle to lower class and you can still see shreds of that in existence today.  You can still see shreds of, "I can't go here because this is not my group."  "I cannot be accepted here because this is not my group," and it's stupid, but it still exists, there's still a caste system.
Story_ID: 571851
Speaker 1: Is there anything that we have not talked about that you would like to talk about?
Speaker 2: You want to talk a little politics?
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I always want to talk about poli- (laughter).  I think that the church should be active in political advocacy.  I don't think that the church should endorse candidates, and I don't think that the church really can do that as used to be done now.  When I was little, they would tell you, you're going to vote for so and so.  You can't do that anymore now because the feds don't smile on that kind of thing and because I have a diverse pop- you know, congregation.  I don't have a whole lot of black Republicans in here, but I've got some, you know, and I would not presuppose to tell them to vote against what they consider to be their principles but I think the church has a responsibility to educate people as to what's happening politically, to make sure that people are informed as to what those have elected to doing in the way of making public policy, to be able to register voters and hold them accountable at the polls and I think the church has an obligation in a non-partisan manner to speak out against unjust laws, unjust policies and to say these things are ungodly and need to be changed.  One of the hats I wear is first vice [vice president] of the local NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People].  I used to be, state NAACP chair and even though I don't toot my horn much about it, I actually drafted the sanctions that we put into place on a Confederate flag, that we still have in place there.  So I think there's a role for the church to play in the area of advocacy.
Speaker 1: Okay, tell me about other organizations that you belong to?
Speaker 2: Oh, Lord, let's see.  I'm first vice of the NAACP locally, I am first vice for the A.M.E. ministerial alliance. I am the board chairman right now for Pastors [Pastors, Inc.] which is a community development organization in Charleston [South Carolina] that's doing a couple of things, one of those is creating affordable housing in Peninsula Charle -even though that's almost an oxymoron these days, creating affordable housing in peninsula Charleston and creating job development and working for community improvement.  I am a part of an advocacy group for school progress and school change so that the schools in Charleston, which have a ways to go, especially those public schools can have the right kind of support.  I am president-elect of the South Carolina Christian Action Council which is our state's ecumenical agency.  I am board chair of the South Carolina Coalition of Black Church Leaders which does, on a larger scale of what Pastors does on the Charleston scale.  I don't think I'm leaving any hats out right now.  I think those are about my primary hats right now (laughter).

Speaker 1: And tell me about what your wife has, does she still work outside the home (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, she's a marvelous teacher.  She is a--
Speaker 1: And your sons?
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Well, I'll work in the reverse order.  My baby is a student at Savannah College of Art and Design, Jeremy [Jeremy Darby].  He's an excellent artist and I'm sure that by the time this is history, his name will be somewhere in history, too.  His older brother, Jason [Jason Darby], lives in Columbia [South Carolina].  He's, he's a graduate of South Carolina State [South Carolina State University, Orangeburg, South Carolina].  He actually stayed four years and graduated from South Carolina State, then went to Carolina [University of South Carolina, Columbia, South Carolina] for his master's [degree].  He's got his own journalism in mass communication and marketing business in Columbia.  He worked at SC State, headed the PR [public relations] department at Allen University [Columbia, South Carolina] for a while, worked at SCANA [SCANA Corporation] and then decided to launch out on his own and is doing very nicely.  Their mother, my wife, Mary [Mary Bright Darby], is probably the best teacher I've met in my life because I have seen how she teaches.  I know the frustrations that accompany that but it's amazing to me, she teaches kindergarten.  She can take a bunch of kids at the beginning of the school year because she prefers to work with children who are from challenged economic circumstances, she can take a bunch of kids, who at the beginning of the year, literally don't know their names, know their nicknames, but don't know their name.  By the middle of the year, she will have them reciting, by memory, at least eight or ten poems and doing simple math and doing simple writing.  By the end of the year, she has them writing stories and doing math on the second grade level.  Now, I don't know how she does it, she's good at what she does, she's a, she's a phenomenal teacher and I celebrate that as well as celebrating the good work she does as a clergy spouse.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, and she fares well as the first lady?
Speaker 2: Oh, she, she first lady's quite well.  She has, there's a knack to being first lady.
Speaker 1: Yes there is.
Speaker 2: And I don't think everybody has that knack.  You have to be visible enough so that you, A, offer leadership where that leadership is solicited and proper and B, have just the right length of fangs to say, "Back off, he's taken, he's comfortably taken," but at the same time, be low key enough so that people do not bring you stuff that's actually pastoral concerns so that folk don't try to get you wrapped up in congregational games, and she does that well.  She's very active as missionary society [Women's Missionary Society] used to be, conference vice president when we were in Columbia and did a wonderful job with that but also stays under the radar enough that, you know, if they need her to do something, she's always here but she's not standing up and saying, they're--her favorite words are, "I am not the pastor, he is."  That's her favorite words.

Speaker 1: Tell me what are your concerns for the African American community in the future?
Speaker 2: My concerns are numerous. Chief among those is that we did not make the proper transition, I don't think, with a massive opportunity that we had in the late '60s [1960s], early '70s [1970s] and we're paying the price for it today.  The, the anthem of the movement, the Civil Rights Movement was, 'We Shall Overcome,' and we had some folk who assumed that with the passage of legislation, Civil Rights Act [Civil Rights Act of 1964], Voting Rights Act [Voting Rights Act of 1965], it meant that we have overcome and so consequently that movement mentality got laid aside.  They got to be more of a, okay, now that we've overcome, what can I do for myself kind of mentality and that got us to be very status conscious so that we have become in many ways the ultimate consumers and not the producers along with the consumers.  If I go home to Columbia [South Carolina] right now, there's a part of Main Street there that when I was coming up used to be, the stores were Jewish owned and the customers were black folk.  Now, the stores are owned by those from Asia and Middle East but the customers are still black folk.  We still, we laid aside that sense of responsibility, in some cases, let our businesses languish and die because we were more interested in the consuming and in integration which meant being like somebody else rather than maintaining your own identity.  That consumerism is killing us because, I think, that's why you have little folk running around with their pants down under their butts because they don't know the imagery is just the style.  They're even passing it onto kids who don't look like them, the untied shoes, the other things, there's a trim there and I don't think that we have the counter balance anymore.  My oldest son [Jason Darby] illustrated that to me wonderfully when hip hop was fresh and he was in high school and I didn't like hip hop, you know, this was outrageous stuff and was taking him to school one morning and something hip hop came on the radio and I just flipped it over to the oldies station and started into my lecture to him about how that's not really music.  Back in my day we had songs with respect and dignity and a sense of pride and that's when Johnnie Taylor comes on the radio singing, "Who's making love to your old lady, while you were out making love?"  He just gave me that knowing look like, yeah, dignity and pride and it taught me that, yeah, I listened to that in my day but then on Sunday, I listen to "Blessed assurance, Jesus is mine," there was a counterbalance.  We're raising a generation now that does not have the counterbalance so rap becomes reality, hip hop becomes reality and there's nobody there to check that and say, "Wait a minute, that's not reality, they're actually getting paid to act like thugs and you're not getting paid, you don't need to necessarily act that way."  So, it shows in our children, it shows in our productivity.  I'm concerned because we're in an America as well that is less tolerant of diversity and divergent views where somehow or another God got to be a blond, blue-eyed Republican and a conservative one at that and the last time I looked at my Bible, I don't remember seeing that description but when you're in a time and place as a litmus test on faith equates faith with citizenship and says your faith does not match my faith which has to be the standard, we have a serious problem and if we are not careful, America could be cyclical, you know, people forget that following the Civil War during the period of Reconstruction, you had a bunch of African American elected officials.  You had a right to vote.  You had thriving businesses.  You had all of that and when the wind blew in a different direction, after Reconstruction, all of that fell.  I, it worries me that if black folk are not careful about taking care of business and making sure that we elect people with good sense, making sure that we maintain strong community institutions, if we're not careful, that cycle's going to turn and then all of a sudden everybody who says I'm so sorry I missed the Civil Rights Movement, won't have a reason to be sorry anymore because it'll be time for a Civil Rights Movement all over again (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) All over again.

Speaker 1: On one last note.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: What do you think about Barack Obama [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama] running for president?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I wish the brother well.  I think that he's a viable candidate, not because what, what did Joe Biden say, he's clean, articulate and something like that, I--it's not that kind of a wish well.  I think that he has mastered somehow the ability to be impressive to white America and authentic at the same time, and for the life of me I don't know how he did it.  So I give the brother kudos for that, because he really speaks a good message.  It's not, it's not one of those, I'm black and conservative so I must be one of y'all kinds of messages.  It's an authentic message.  I would not be surprised to see him as president one day.  I don't know, excuse me, if that day is yet because someone could easily raise the same objection to him this time around in 2007, 2008, as they raised to John Edwards four years ago when they said, you're running for president but you weren't in the [U.S.] Senate but for a term or two.  Somebody could just as easily say to him, you're running but you've only been there a term or two.  So, I'd love to see him as president one day.  I hope that this is an educational process for America.  I like the brother but, you know, I hope that he prays, counts the cost and I hope that if he does run and makes a good showing, and somebody says, you know, maybe vice president is a possibility, that he might pray on that at least.

Speaker 1: When you look back over your life, what one thing stands out the most?
Speaker 2: That I've been richly blessed.  I think more than anything, there's a contemporary gospel song, the last little bar of the first verse says, "When I look around, think things over, all of my good days outweigh my bad days, I won't complain."  That could be my next national anthem, because it amazes me somehow the nature of unmerited grace that all of us in this world have problems, have headaches, mess up, sometimes mess up quite badly, but still, in spite of all those misstep, God keeps picking us up and dusting us off, patting us on the head and carrying us on anyhow.  And so, I look back and I count the blessings of life to be the thing that stands out for me, good family, good friends, being in a pulpit where I never would have expected to be, having a level of hope for community regard that I would never have expected to have.  God's been good to me.

Speaker 1: How do you want to be remembered?
Speaker 2: There's a question I hope nobody has to ask for another fifty years.
Speaker 1: Oh, you know you have plenty of years but what do you want people to, well, okay, what do you want people to say about you?
Speaker 2: I want people to say simply that my heart was in the right place, that I tried to do the right thing and that somehow along the way I might have made a difference.  If I'm remembered like that, then I'll be just fine, that somewhere along the way I will have made a difference.  I was, I opened a book, I had to do a workshop at another church and they had one of these A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] history books we did in 1787 and I saw a picture of one of our general officers, a gentleman by the name of Al Holman [ph.].  Al has been going to glory for four or five years now but I can remember the impact that Al had on the church.  I'd like for somebody one day to be able to open a book like that, or do something like that when I'm gone to glory and to be able to say, yeah, I remember him and he actually did make an impact, that'll be good.
Speaker 1: Okay, well, we want to thank you--
Speaker 2: Thank you.
Speaker 1: --for taking the time to tell us your story.
Speaker 2: Thank you.
Speaker 1: It has been inspirational--
Speaker 2: Thank you.
Speaker 1: --and I'm sure the generations to come will find it inspirational as well.
Speaker 2: Thank you, I didn't even know it would stretch out quite as far as it did.  It's been a pleasure meeting you and pleasure doing this.

Speaker 1: This is my mom, Eloise Darby [Eloise Janerette Darby], my dad, Joseph Darby [Joseph Darby, Sr.], both of those pictures were taken probably late '40s [1940s], early '50s [1950s].  Mom is sitting on the fence at our home on Wheeler Hill, 1520 Wheat Street [Columbia, South Carolina].  Dad is walking down Assembly Street in Columbia, South Carolina, looking quite dapper as he goes, apparently.
Speaker 2: Okay, this is my, my older son, Jason [Jason Darby], who's on the left side and I, we're on the campus at Allen University [Columbia, South Carolina] and I had just, as a matter of fact, Jason had just arranged a photo shoot for me, of all things, and we were talking outside and the photographer took one final shot of us together.  The dark glasses are incidental, mine are photo grade, his just happened to come out of the shop that way, I think.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.
Speaker 2: Okay, that's me, probably about ten years ago when my wife was president of the Columbia conference, Women's Missionary Society, they did a wonderful African theme, the prayer breakfast and she made me get all African-themed up for the occasion.  So that's me in that outfit that she brought me for that occasion.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Okay, the bottom one.
Speaker 2: Okay, the bottom one is my wife, Mary [Mary Bright Darby], and I on, roughly about the time of our thirtieth wedding anniversary.  That's taken in my office here at church [Morris Brown African Methodist Episcopal Church, Charleston, South Carolina].
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Okay, and the top one.
Speaker 2: And the top one is my wife, Mary, and I on December 13th, 1973 when we got married and that's the reception picture from that.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.  Okay, ready?
Speaker 2: Okay, that picture is probably from about 1984, I would guess.  The A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] church used to have an event called the Debutante-Master showcase.  That was taken when I was pastor at Pine Grove [Pine Grove A.M.E. Church, Columbia, South Carolina].  That's my wife, Mary, and I and that was the year that the young lady from our church was a debutante for the state.
