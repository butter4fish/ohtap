Speaker 1: And favorite phrase or saying, do you have one?
Speaker 2: You know what I mean.
Speaker 1: I like it's not rocket science, but I may not be able to use that too often.  People say that they don't like that.
Story_ID: 103039
Speaker 1: Okay, I want to start out by asking you about your family background.  So, I know your father was not in your life, but can you give his name?
Speaker 2: Yes, Eugene Walker.
Speaker 1: Okay, and you don't know really anything about his side of the family, right--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, can you give your mother's name?
Speaker 2: Sure, my mother's name is Beulah Davis Spencer.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And she was born and raised in a small Louisiana town called Rayne.  And that is where I lived after I was born for a couple of years, and then we moved to Texas.
Speaker 1: So, when you say a couple of years, were you two years old when you moved to Texas or a little older than that?
Speaker 2: Actually, I was a little older than that because my younger sister was also born by that time, and we probably moved when we were four or five--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --when I was four or five.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, can you tell me about what you know about your mother's background and her growing up?  Did she, did she grow up in Rayne?
Speaker 2: My mother did grow up in Rayne.  What I know is that it was poor.  She grew up, as many African Americans, in small, rural towns.  She experienced significant racism.  And the opportunities for her as a young girl were very limited because of the expectations for a young girl, a young black girl, in rural Louisiana was, was in many ways constrained.  But she did very well and graduated, went, went on to high school, not in Louisiana but actually in, in, in Houston, Texas.
Speaker 1: How would you describe your mother?
Speaker 2: My mother is a dynamo.  My mother is very interested in the world, was always very encouraging of me and validated my unique qualities and attributes.  It's one of those situations where you always feel that your mother is in your corner and your number one cheerleader.  And I certainly have felt that throughout my life, that she was very committed to my own success, my own growth and development, and in many ways, I owe much of my success to her investment in me and her belief in me.
Speaker 1: So, did she ever share any stories of her growing up though in--in Rayne, Rayne is how far from Lafayette [Louisiana]?
Speaker 2: Rayne is about thirty or forty miles from Lafayette.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No, she didn't.  And I think it may be because growing up in that time and in that period of, of her life was a very challenging time because her mother died, and so her mother died, and my mother, my mother's basically sister took her to Texas.  So my mother actually left Rayne as a thirteen-year-old girl and went to Houston to live with her aunt, who was a domestic for a family in Houston.  And she was from that time until she returned to Rayne, when she was around twenty, she lived in, in Houston.
Speaker 1: So the, the people would then sometimes there's--I saw that there're three hours difference--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --between that part.
Speaker 2: Indeed.  In many ways, there was, you know, we're aware of the Great Migration that Isabel Wilkerson has written so well about ["The Warmth of Other Suns"].  But there were many migrations within the Great Migration.  So, for example, there were many people from rural Louisiana who moved to Texas.  And my mother's family was a part of that migration.  And, but there was a lot of circularity, so we spent many occasions returning to Rayne for the weekend, for a week during the summer.  And so, as a boy, I remember vividly that community, and I remember that my mother always wanted to go home.  I think part of it was because of a sense of a community, and her siblings were all there, and so it was important for her to have the opportunity to, to return.
Speaker 1: So, is it spelled R-A-I-N or--
Speaker 2: R-A-Y--
Speaker 1: --Y--
Speaker 2: --N-E.
Speaker 1: Oh, R-A-Y-N-E, Rayne.  Okay, that (unclear).
Story_ID: 103040
Speaker 1: Now, what is your earliest memory of growing up?
Speaker 2: My earliest memory of my growing up is of my being on the front porch of this little shotgun house that we lived in, in Ames, Texas, and my riding a tricycle around on the porch.  And it was one of those elevated shotgun houses on stilts, and I went flying off of the porch and landed and cut myself, my head. In fact, I have, still have the scars on, on the back of my head from that fall.  And I remember that my mother [Beulah Davis Spencer] was very distraught.  And I remember that I was crying and clearly realized that, that I'd been in some kind of accident.  I remember that vividly.
Story_ID: 103041
Speaker 1: So, your--when you moved, do you remember when you move also to Houston [Texas]?
Speaker 2: Well, so, when we left at, when I was four, and we moved to, to Ames, Texas--
Speaker 1: Ames, Texas, which is--
Speaker 2: We moved to Ames, Texas.  I was four, and I remember that, that time, I think, which, which was around the time I was riding--because we moved into this little shotgun house.
Speaker 1: Oh, so this story that you just told is in Ames?
Speaker 2: Is in Ames, yes, yes.  I have no memory of, of, of--
Speaker 1: Rayne [Louisiana].
Speaker 2: --Louisiana, of Rayne.  I have no memory whatsoever before we moved.  My first memory as a child was of, was of being in Rayne.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I'm sorry, being in Ames.
Speaker 1: Ames.  So in Ames, so are you--is it also rural too?
Speaker 2: Yes, in Ames, Ames is a, was a small town, is a small town, was a small town of approximately maybe three or four thousand people when I was growing up.  The next town was Liberty, Texas.  And Liberty, Texas, maybe in 1965 had 25,000 people, 50,000 today maybe.  So, this was the setting for my early years.  I also remember when I was in Head Start, and I read--I was very interested in reading, my mother encouraged me to read, and we had a book called "Wings to Adventure."  And I remember that the book was in, it, it was about fantasy and travel.  And I remember thinking that it, it was otherworldly, because it was so out of my lived experience, but it so sparked my imagination.  And it was the first time I thought about travel and a world outside of my own.
Speaker 1: That book?
Speaker 2: Mm.
Speaker 1: Now, can you describe--so are you living in the shotgun house in Ames a long time, or do you move around?
Speaker 2: So, I live in that, we live in that little house until--I then, when I'm, when I'm in the--we moved to Baytown [Texas], to Goose Creek, whatever you want to you--(unclear)--when I was in the maybe third grade, and, and that's where I lived from then until graduating from high school.
Speaker 1: So, what is that area like?  What was the difference in those two places?
Speaker 2: Well, moving to, to Baytown/Goose Creek was closer to Houston [Texas], so that was good.  We lived, then it, it was about forty-five minutes to an hour outside of Houston.  And it was, still a small town, but because of the proximity to Houston, there was--and the fact that there were just more jobs there because there was a very large Humble Oil refinery, so the economic situation there was much better than it was in the small town of, the very small town of Ames.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And it was racially very segregated.  I remember that the schools were transitioning and had recently transition to integration, and that the colored, the Negro high school, which was called George Washington Carver, had become a junior high school in the newly integrated district, and that the African American students from George Washington Carver were then transferred to Robert E. Lee High School.  And there was another school called Ross S. Sterling, and I ultimately went to high school at Ross S. Sterling High School.  Ross S. Sterling was a governor of, of Texas.
Story_ID: 103042
Speaker 1: So, I wanna take you back to when you moved into that community, you know, in--
Speaker 2: When I moved to Ames [Texas] or to Baytown/Goose Creek [Texas]?
Speaker 1: Bay, Baytown Goose Creek, well, in between the two.  I would like you to tell me what sights, smells, and sounds remind you of growing up.
Speaker 2: Well, my dear Aunt Ida lived not far away from us.  And she had chickens, so I remember the smell of chickens, and I remember chicken feed.  And I remember that there was a lot of dirt and grass.  I remember really good Southern cooked food like collard greens and smothered pork chops.  And my mother [Beulah Davis Spencer] was a, is a great cook and would often cook these terrific gumbos, which is where my love of gumbo started.  And those were the sights, the smells.  The sights were: very small town, ideas of, of living.  I mean I remember my school being a small, a little school.  My Head Start class being in, I believe it was a classroom in one of the Catholic schools, the Catholic church I believe is where my Head Start was, which was just a few hundred yards from our little house.  And I remember crossing the railroad tracks.  And I just remember that I used to love to go from Ames to Liberty [Texas] with, with my mother to the Piggly Wiggly because the Piggly Wiggly was the local grocery store.  And we didn't have that in Ames, but we did have a Piggly Wiggly in Liberty.  So to go into Liberty to the Piggly Wiggly was a joy and excitable moment for me.
Story_ID: 103043
Speaker 1: So, your sister's name, she, her, her name is Re, is it Renee?
Speaker 2: Renee.
Speaker 1: --nee, and she's two years you said--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --younger than you.
Speaker 2: So, I have a younger sister, Renee, who, and we have the same father [Eugene Walker].  And then I have two younger sisters, who my mother [Beulah Davis Spencer] had with her second husband, yes.
Speaker 1: And so that's why your mother's last name is Spencer.
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: Right.  So--
Speaker 2: And, and my two younger sisters are named Spencer.
Speaker 1: So, what, tell me about family life, you know, what, what, what, what is the structure in your family?  Were there chores, you know?  Were your mother, is she working out of the household at Ames [Texas], or does that--
Speaker 2: So, when I was a, when I was a boy living in Ames, the, it was, really I spent--my mother worked a lot, and so I spent the, the formative time with my Aunt Ida and my Uncle Warren.  And my, Aunt Ida is still alive at ninety-one I think.  I just remember that I did a lot of chores, that I read a lot, that I was somewhat mischievous, and I talked a lot, and that they would on occasion play games with me to get me to quiet down.  I was absolutely a child with a lot of, shall we say, excess energy.  But it was my Aunt Ida, my mother, everyone, always reinforced me.  And you know, it was, it was, it was always a challenge for them; I was always a challenge, I'm sure.
Speaker 1: You, you think you were asking a lot of questions and--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --'round then?
Speaker 2: I was asking a lot of questions.  I was--you know, I remember once someone saying to my mother: Why is he so nosy?  Why does he ask all of these questions?  Doesn't he know that children should just be quiet?  And I was just too inquisitive probably and had far too much energy.  And, and so for that reason, on occasion I would be reprimanded, or someone would, would say, you know, can you just please calm him down?
Speaker 1: They probably thought you, you were spoiled too, maybe.
Speaker 2: Yes, I think that it was, it could be, or it could be that I just was perceived as a nuisance in some ways.
Speaker 1: So, so what, what is family life like though?  I mean is it--do you--what is everyday life like?  And when you're staying, you're saying your--how far is the distance between Aunt Ida and, and Uncle Warren's in your mother's--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Oh, that's just, that's a mile, I mean that's a mile.  And, and even after we then moved to Baytown and Goose Creek and I'm in Goose Creek schools, I still love to visit my Aunt Ida, and I still enjoy that a lot.  But by that time, my mother had remarried for a period of time.  And, and I also spent a lot of time with my, my aunt and uncle in Houston [Texas].  I would--my mother would take us into, to Houston for, to see Aunt Rosie and Uncle Lewis.  And we would stay with them for weekends, and so I would enjoy that.  And so my, my fondest memories were, were, were that, were going into Houston or going to this small town to see my, my Aunt Ida.  And then I, in school, during this period really started to be excited about both my school work as well as the extracurricular activities.  I was very involved in things like the Key Club and student government.  I was, I was very much an active student and, and enjoyed my student life a lot, a lot.  And my mother worked a lot, and so, you know, I don't have a lot to say, because my mother worked a lot.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And, and, otherwise, things could be volatile, and I found that for me, the real joy for me was in, what I did at school and all the things I did extracurricular really brought me great joy and satisfaction.
Story_ID: 103044
Speaker 1: And you said, also I read that you had an active imagination.  You know, that you--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --so was that--you know, I often find in doing these interviews in that seven to nine-year-old period that a lot of formation of people are, you know, sort of happening.  But what are you thinking when you are imagining things?  What, what's in your head at that point as a young person?
Speaker 2: Well, as a young kid what you often imagine is a world outside of your own.  And so, for me, I was always interested in imagining myself not in the condition that I necessarily was in at that time and in many ways not like many of the people I encountered, and imagining a different life for myself and thinking about how one gets there.  I was always very ambitious and eager and, but I also very clear that I wanted a different life for myself, and I had that resolve at a pretty early age.  I didn't know exactly what it was, but I knew that my imagination made me think about things like being a lawyer or going to college in a place like Austin, Texas, which was magical to me to even consider such a thing, and that I was just interested in a world outside of, of my own.  And you know, I mean it, I, I think it was challenging, but I don't spend a lot of time analyzing why it was so challenging.  I just know that it was challenging enough for me to spend a lot of time imagining myself outside of that world.
Story_ID: 103045
Speaker 1: So what, what are your role models and things.  Where are you finding those, that--
Speaker 2: So at that time my role models were, I would read an Ebony magazine or a Jet magazine.  I would see stories about people like Whitney Young.  I'd read stories about middle-class blacks in Ebony and imagine being like that.  I'd see people traveling in magazines, and I had a really active imagination about the possibility for me, being inspired and leading a life like all of these people I saw in the magazines or that I read about historical figures, people who were making a difference in the world, and realizing that I aspired to be like them, but that to be like them I would have to work hard and have a very clear sense of direction.  And, and so, that's what I spent my time, that was a way of coping, and that was a way of, of my own negotiation with myself about where I was at any particular time and where I wanted to be.
Story_ID: 103046
Speaker 1: Now what is church, what role is church playing in your growing up?
Speaker 2: Well, my aunt, who I think I mentioned in Houston [Texas], and my aunt--
Speaker 1: That's Aunt Rosie?
Speaker 2: Aunt Rosie, and then Aunt Ida.
Speaker 1: Aunt Ida.
Speaker 2: Both were very much church-going, my mother [Beulah Davis Spencer] as well, but not as frequently.  So, I wasn't steeped in the black church experience, although I went frequently enough.  But I certainly had a sense from, particularly, my Aunt Rosie, who was very active in St. Mary's Church, her church, I had a sense for the role of the black church as not only a place for spiritual sustenance, but for leadership development, for character development, for building one's self-esteem.  My grandmother and my grandfather were leaders of their church.  But they were domestics who never graduated from high school and spent most of their time taking orders.  And to have, every Sunday, a place where they were in charge, where they made the decisions, was far more than spiritual for them.  It gave them enormous opportunity to be leaders, to have influence, to have their own self-esteem and their own self-worth validated.
Story_ID: 103047
Speaker 1: Now, what are you--are you aware, let me ask this question, are you aware of what's happening in the Civil Rights Movement and some of the uproars this young person--
Speaker 2: Oh yes, I'm--
Speaker 1: Okay--
Speaker 2: --very aware because I'd read about it all the time in Ebony and Jet.  And I remember that when [Reverend] Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] was assassinated, the next day my mother [Beulah Davis Spencer] said you're not going to go to school today.  This is an important day.  This is very tragic for America and for black folk in this country, that Dr. King has been assassinated.  And so, I absolutely remember the struggle during the '60s [1960s] in my childhood.  And I was quite enmeshed in it and the history of it.  I always was interested in history.  And, and so, and I was always interested in biographies.  And I remember in the library reading biographies of, of African Americans or reading biographical material about the Civil Rights Movement or some aspect of history.  So I'm very aware of it, and, and it had a huge impact on my life.
Story_ID: 103048
Speaker 1: So now when you--so you said your elementary school is, give me your schools again.
Speaker 2: My element, so I went to Cedar--well, I, I started in Ames [Texas].  I forgot what the name of, what was the name of the elementary--and then I went to Cedar Bayou [Junior High School].
Speaker 1: Okay, in Cedar Bayou you were in--
Speaker 2: Is--
Speaker 1: --seventh grade?
Speaker 2: I was in, I was in sixth--
Speaker 1: Sixth--
Speaker 2: --fifth grade, sixth grade, in that, in that period.
Speaker 1: So that's like 1964, '65 [1965] or '65 [1965]--
Speaker 2: Sixty-five [1965], '66' [1966].
Speaker 1: --sixty-six [1966].  Okay and then--
Speaker 2: And so I was there for ten, for ten years, until really I, I graduated from high school, and that, this is when I was in Baytown [Texas] and Goose Creek schools.
Speaker 1: I see, and the, and the high school, what was the name?
Speaker 2: Ross Sterling High School [Baytown, Texas].
Speaker 1: Ross Sterling, okay, that's right, after the governor--
Speaker 2: After the former governor.
Speaker 1: --the former governor.
Speaker 2: (Unclear)--
Speaker 1: So, so what is your, is your school segregated or is--
Speaker 2: No, my school is not segregated at all.  The schools, by the time, the mid-sixties [1960s], '67 [1967], the schools in most Texas towns are, are integrated.  My schools had been integrated, and there were still some residue from that, but they were fully integrated.  And I must say that I always was successful in school.  I encountered racism, but I established a pattern of being the first, you know, maybe class president or a member of this club or that, I mean I, I, early on, that was a part of my record.  And so, there, there clearly were opportunities because often these were other students electing you, and the student body was primarily white.  And so, I clearly may have experienced racism, but I, to be fair, had tremendous opportunity for leadership development, and that was made partly because of other students, other white students promoting me.
Speaker 1: So, so how--what was the racial composition do you think of your--
Speaker 2: It was, it was--
Speaker 1: --of your junior high and then your high?
Speaker 2: Of my junior high it was 60 percent white, 15 percent African American, and the remainder Hispanic.
Speaker 1: So the Hispanic influence is definitely being felt at--
Speaker 2: Oh, absolutely.
Speaker 1: --point.
Speaker 2: Absolutely, the Hispanic--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --influence is being felt--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --of course, as it has since the founding of the Texas independent nation.  But the, the majority population, the white students, were very supportive.  Some of the parents weren't as much, but the student body, overall, I, felt that I had lots of opportunity.
Story_ID: 103216
Speaker 1: So, in school then, are all your, what about your teachers, are there black and white teachers or is it--
Speaker 2: Mostly white, and very supportive of me.  Every one of my role model teachers were white, and I had excellent, professional educators, conservative, but very committed to my education.  And so, I remember their names because they had such an influence on me, and I, I, to this day, count my blessings.
Speaker 1: So what were some of their names?
Speaker 2: Like Mrs. Majors, who, I was in an advanced reading class in the second or third grade.  And we--I remember my love of Shakespeare came out of the experience of reading Shakespeare at eight or nine-years-old.  And Mrs. Majors produced a puppet show, and we did Macbeth, in the third grade; I was Angus.  And I fell in love with Shakespeare.  And I remember Mrs.--Ms. Sabulka [ph.], who was my geography teacher in the sixth grade.  And I loved geography because it was all about these faraway places, a map that I could imagine.  And Mrs. Sabulka would have these projects for us where we would dress in costumes of foreign nations, or we would put together these, these presentations where we talked about the indigenous people of a nation or the topography of a particular country or continent.  And it was, it was old-fashioned, conservative education.  Mrs. Pugh [ph.], my history teacher in the eighth grade was fantastic.  I loved history.  She knew I loved history.  She would encourage me to check out books from the library about people who weren't necessarily a part of our, our story.  And I just loved them all, and they so supported me and gave me really hard feedback.  I remember once Mrs. Majors--I had gotten into a really big fight with another student.  It wasn't a physical fight, but it was just maybe he said something, I said something, and we were yelling.  And, and Mrs. Majors took me out in the hall, and she said Darren, you are going to have to learn to control yourself.  You have to learn self-control.  And it was the first time anyone talked to me that way.  And it was very different than saying, you know, like someone might say at home, you know, stop being a boy, or you're such a bad boy, or why are you acting so crazy?  And to have her say: you have to learn self-control; self-control is very important for you, because you have a hard time controlling your impulses, and if you don't get that under control, you are gonna be in trouble.  And I just remember her telling me that.  And it was the first time I started to think about actually internalizing the idea of self-control.  And, and so, I had lessons like that along the way, and that's what made it possible for me to think about a world outside of my own.  I had amazing teachers.
Speaker 1: So she gave you very specific--
Speaker 2: Very specific.
Speaker 1: It was more, it was more specific thing.
Speaker 2: Very specific.
Speaker 1: Okay, and obviously you looked up to her so you were--
Speaker 2: Oh, my goodness, I so admired her, so admired her.
Story_ID: 103217
Speaker 1: So in high school [at Ross S. Sterling High School in Baytown, Texas], what are the teachers or the subjects or the activities that you're engaged in?
Speaker 2: I'm engaged in just about everything in high school.  I was in, I was in the Key Club; I was student government; I was class favorite; I was a cheerleader; I was on the track team.  I did a lot of things in high school.
Speaker 1: So, so your grades, how were they?
Speaker 2: I was a B+ student.  And I was never an A student.  I always had A's and B's.  And, and it was, for me, a very well-rounded and grounded experience in high school.  I, I was super-involved.  And I did well in academics.  And I always felt that I had this balanced life.  Of course, I worked.  I had a lot--
Speaker 1: And who were--
Speaker 2: --going on.
Speaker 1: You had, you were working where?  Just--
Speaker 2: I worked, I was a busboy; I worked as a waiter; I worked at, in fast food.  I did just about everything because I, from a, from probably thirteen or fourteen I always worked.  And so I always had my, my own money, and I always had, you know, I had sustained myself that way.
Story_ID: 103218
Speaker 1: So when it comes to, time to go to, to school or, is it always thought that you're going to college?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --I was always going to college.
Speaker 1: And, and so--
Speaker 2: The question was where?  And I, the, the dream of going to Austin was, of course, a dream, because for a, an African American in the 1970s there were very few in Texas who attended the University of Texas at Austin [Austin Texas].  The Austin campus had primarily served the white elite from the urban areas of the state.  And in fact, there were 30-plus-thousand undergraduates at the University of Texas when I enrolled, and there were less than 1,000 African Americans.  We were in the low hundreds, and of that number a significant number were in the athletics program.  And so I was very fortunate, in many ways, to find my way to Austin.  But I will say, I often say this, and I don't--I feel like my life began when I got to Austin.
Speaker 1: It opened up a new world?
Speaker 2: It opened up a new world, and I just felt I was able to really turn the page and look forward and just look forward, and that's what I did.  I so loved being in and being at the University of Texas.  I so loved it, in fact, I never went home.  I was either a summer orientation advisor or a summer RA every year, literally, until I went to law school.  And so, it, it was just because I loved being in Austin, and it was home.  And the University of Texas was such a transformative institution in my life; I just loved it.
Speaker 1: So who are you meeting there, and who are your friends, and who are the teachers?  Who's influ--'cause you said 30,000, right?
Speaker 2: Mm-hm.
Speaker 1: So, in, so, a lot of times in large public institutions there are smaller--
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: --schools.
Speaker 2: And I think in many ways, it affirmed for me my desire to never be in any one clique of people.  In high school I wasn't in a clique.  I, I've never been a clique kind of person.  I've always had friends in different circles, and I've always enjoyed venturing in and out of those circles, but never wanting to plant myself so firmly that anyone can say oh, he's with this clique or that clique.  Because I actually find that working at the intersection of all of these different people and communities is what makes life doable and interesting.  And that's a lesson that has remained with me to this day.  But in, in college, I had friends who were very diverse.  I had black friends, who were in the Black Student Association and in the Afro Studies Program.  I had gay friends, because people knew about me.
Speaker 1: Did you know about yourself at that point?
Speaker 2: I did, absolutely, I did.  And so there wasn't a struggle about my--
Speaker 1: Identity.
Speaker 2: --my identity, my sexual orientation.
Speaker 1: When did, when did you know, when did you determine that, in high school?
Speaker 2: Oh yes, I mean, I mean--
Speaker 1: Before that?
Speaker 2: --before.  I mean that was, I, I knew as a child that I must, I knew that I was different, and people told me I was different.  So, I certainly knew that and came to terms with that certainly by the time I went, went off to college.
Speaker 1: Did anyone ever call you (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Oh yes, of course.
Speaker 1: --derogatory terms?
Speaker 2: Of course.  Oh, my gosh, you get called a punk, a queer, a fag, all of those things, of course, of course.
Speaker 1: Did anyone ever try to "man" you up or get--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: No, it wasn't, I was never, I was always a strong kid, so I never, there was never any of the physical or any of the kinds of things that you hear, you know.  I never was bullied and all of these terrible things that you hear that happened, that happened in the past and continue to happen to, to, to gay kids and adults even.  I mean I, I just never experienced that.
Speaker 1: But you were always popular though too.
Speaker 2: Well, I, that, that's, yes, and I think part of it was my own, maybe my own outgoing nature and, but I never--I always seemed to be able to transcend.  And part of being able to do that was, in part, because I wasn't ever too affiliated with any one group.  And I had a core group of, of white friends who were in fraternities and sororities.  I had a group of friends who were active political Young Democrats, you know, organizing against South Africa and for disinvestment and things like that.  So, all of these people were a part of my life.

Speaker 1: I was head of the Texas Student Union, and so the Student Union was on the campus [of the University of Texas at Austin in Austin, Texas] a very important institution.
Speaker 2: Well, that would be--don't you have to run to be part of this?
Speaker 1: No, I wasn't--so the student government and the--
Speaker 2: I see.
Speaker 1: --Student Union are two different things.
Speaker 2: So ha--
Speaker 1: The Student Union is actually a physical building and a, a sort of programming and, and services--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: So that, so was that where the programs, like if people are doing lectures--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Yes, so--
Speaker 2: --and things like that?
Speaker 1: --exactly.  So we ran the lecture, the cultural programs, the student catering business, the, the, the, the student entrepreneurial, the media program for our students.  So it was, it was very much a programming place.  But I learned a lot in that experience in terms of managing a complex organization, managing a board, engaging at a high level with, with people.  Ultimately, when I, by the time I graduated from the University of Texas, I, sort of like in high school, I had done a lot.  And the highest honor one can receive at the University of Texas is to be elected into the Friar Society.  The Friar Society is the university's oldest honorary society, and I was very honored to be elected.  And I was the abbot or president of the organization, and I was the first African American in that role.  And I vividly recall one of those occasions that every African American can relate to, where I, as president of the Friar Society, was invited to the Governor's Mansion, because when we tapped the honorees each year, the governor would have a reception because it was a big deal in Texas when that happened, to announce and present the year's new members.  And I was walking over to introduce myself to a, the wife of one of our regents.  And she turned to me as I was approaching her and passed me her glass and said that she'd like a gin and tonic, please.  And she looked down and saw that I actually had a name tag on.  And, of course, was mortified, and I, of course, said that no apology was necessary, and I just wanted to make sure that I introduced myself as the president of the Friar Society.  And it was one of--I would only say that that isn't the first time I experienced that as an African-American man and being one of the only African-American guests at, at various functions.  You kind of get used to that.  But my college was an amazing experience, and it taught me, it provided me with the foundation to come to New York and be successful here.
Story_ID: 103220
Speaker 1: So you're meeting--you know, I've heard about Austin [Texas], that it's very international now.  Was it international?  'Cause we're talking, you graduate in 1982, so you're, you enter in the fall of '80--
Speaker 2: Of '78 [1978].
Speaker 1: Seventy-eight [1978].
Speaker 2: And, and so yes, Austin, well, to me, Austin was this amazingly sophisticated place.  And I met people who, whose lives were so different.  I remember the first time I had a suitemate, who took me for dinner, and we went to a club in Austin that--he was from Dallas [Texas], and his family was a member of a club in their country club in Dallas, which had reciprocity with the club in Austin.  So he could charge things there; he'd just sign for things.  And I remember going and, and feeling very in, insufficient to be a guest at this club, and very inadequate, and very honored to be there.  He had a very different attitude.  He felt, he was completely a, self-assured that he belonged there.  And not only did he belong there, but he wanted service, and he wanted it right now.  And attitudinally, I had never experienced that, someone who clearly was of privilege and who clearly was comfortable going to nice restaurants, and ordering off menus, and being very clear about how he wanted his meat done, and very clear about his expectations of service.  Even though I had worked on the other side, I, I just hadn't experienced that.  And so, to be exposed to people who gave me such insight into a very different world, my--there was a woman down the hall who said to me once: would you like a Perrier?  And I remember thinking: what's a Perrier?  And these things happened to me.  They were very much cultural markers, if you will, of a different world that I was absolutely not knowledgeable of or had any preparedness, any preparation to engage with.  So, I was thrown into a very different and very diverse world, but very exciting.
Story_ID: 103221
Speaker 1: So, you became class--head of the [Texas] Student Union in--
Speaker 2: Yeah, in--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --Nineteen eighty-one [1981].
Speaker 1: Eighty-one [1981], so a year before you graduate--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yes, my senior year.
Speaker 1: Okay, your senior year.  And then your, you also major in--
Speaker 2: I major in government.
Speaker 1: --govern, government.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: And you, and you minor or, and you have--
Speaker 2: Oh, and I have another in communications as well, yeah.
Speaker 1: --(unclear)--communications.  So what are you thinking and who's advising you, you know--
Speaker 2: So I have great, oh, I had such great mentors in college.  I had Shirley Bird Perry, who was the head the student union, the, the staff person; she was the vice president for student affairs. Susan Clagett, who was the assistant vice president. My professor, John Trimble, my professor of English. The person who was, who worked with us at--Roy Vaughan--at the Alumni Foundation, because I was, I was on the student committee at the Alumni Foundation.  I had amazing mentorship and, and support.  And what I realized was that I was going to go to law school.  And part of the reason I wanted to go to law school was because people I admired had gone to law school.  Not necessarily because I wanted to be a lawyer, although I understood that in Texas, being a lawyer was an important profession and that lawyers were highly regarded in, in the culture, in the, in the political and business community, and in the civil rights community.  So, I, by my second year, I said oh, I'm gonna go to law school.
Speaker 1: And so, you, what do you--who's telling you what you need to do to go to law school?  Or are there any special programs that you're availed of?
Speaker 2: There are many people telling me how to go to law school.  There are all of the people I just mentioned, my advisor in the liberal arts college, my--even by then, the law school itself wanted me to come.  And so I had been told by my senior year that, you know, we hope you're gonna come to school here, and you should know we want you to come to UT Austin for law school.  So I knew that I wanted to go to law school.
Story_ID: 103222
Speaker 1: So do you go to, you graduate and start right out?
Speaker 2: No, I graduated in, in '82 [1982].
Speaker 1: Two--
Speaker 2: And I took a year off.  And in that--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --year, I worked for the then-Republican governor of Texas, who is a very old-fashioned moderate Republican, not like Texas Republicans today, but his name was Bill Clements.  And the reason I went to work for him was one of my mentors, Howard Richards, who was this fantastic businessman in Austin [Texas].  He was a Democrat, but he supported Governor Clements.  And he said to me one day, he's one of the people who is an advisor.  And he said to me one day: I want you to go down to the governor's office and meet with, with my friend there--and because, if you're gonna take a year off--I decided that I didn't want to start law school the following fall, that I wanted to defer my admission.  And the university law school said we'd be happy to defer your admission, as long as you confirm you're going to come and you don't run off to another law school.  And so I deferred my admission.  And Howard Richards set me up to go down to the governor's office and meet George Bayoud, who was one of the governor's aides.  And I met George, and on the spot George said, you have to work for us this next year before you got to law school.  And literally, that's how it happened.  I have been very fortunate in my life to never have really had serious employment searches, if you will, that is an example.  I showed up, and they said you know, we want to hire you, and this will be a good place for you to work be, between now and, and graduation--I'm sorry and, and, and--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --starting your first year.  And that's how I worked there.  And then after law school, the same thing, I, I ended up at a law firm not because, because they recruited on campus and said come and work for us.  I sort of have been passed along that way over the years.
Story_ID: 103223
Speaker 1: So when you're going to law school [University of Texas School of Law, Austin, Texas], what are you thinking that you want to be?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: And you know, how do you want--what do you, do you want to go into private practice, or--
Speaker 2: Well, when I went to law school and during my law school period, I knew that I was going to work in the corporate sector.  I had no fantasy that I was going to work in a public interest law job.  I am very honest and frank with myself about that issue, because for me economic security was very important.  I knew that I would need to help with my three younger sisters.  I knew that my mother [Beulah Davis Spencer] had a very difficult economic situation, and so I felt I had some obligation to help mitigate her situation.  And I knew that I was going to go into the corporate world, at least initially.  And so my, both of my summers in law school were spent working at large corporate law firms.
Speaker 1: So, you know, usually it's hard for first-year law students to get employment, sometimes they can--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --sometimes they can't.  And then the second year is the critical--
Speaker 2: Indeed.
Speaker 1: --the second summers are critical.  So talk about what classes you're gravitating--you know how large is the law school class setting?
Speaker 2: Well, the law school was, was large.  It was 450.  And I really was never enamored of law school.  There were courses like contracts, torts, constitutional law especially, that definitely interested me.  And I was lucky because my first year I was, I landed a job at one of the large law firms in Houston [Texas] as a 1L.  And so I was one of maybe three or four 1L's who the firm hired.  And that made it possible for my second year to not feel that I needed to be in, in Houston, but that I could go outside of Texas and spend a summer.  And so it was my second year that I had a moment of transformation that--that second moment.  You recall I said how when I arrived in, in--
Speaker 1: Austin.
Speaker 2: --Austin, my life was changed.  My second summer I accepted a clerkship in New York at Cleary Gottlieb [Steen & Hamilton].  I thought most certainly I was coming for a summer to enjoy New York, enjoy the fun of being here as a summer associate, to learn from a sophisticated practice on Wall Street, and to have that experience in my belt as I returned to start my career in, in Houston.  And my life changed when I came to New York in the summer of 1985.
Speaker 1: So who did you get the, the fir, the offer from--(unclear)--you said--
Speaker 2: I met a, a, a Texan in New York named [J] Speed Carroll, who was a partner at Cleary Gottlieb.  And he interviewed me on campus.  And he then recruited me very hard to come for the summer, and I think he knew that once I got there, I would be hooked, and he was right.  And so I spent my first summer in New York working on interesting securities matters.  I didn't know just how interesting and pioneering the work was.  It was some of the first asset-backed receivables for automobiles and for credit cards, very pioneering securities work for the clients, Solomon Brothers and Lehman Brothers.  And so, as a young, as a summer associate, to be given exposure, just sitting in the room and taking notes and thinking about how these transactions got structured was so fascinating.  And so I was thrilled to be able to accept the offer, thrilled to receive the offer, and of course, I accepted it right away, much to the dismay of the Texas firm that thought I was coming back.  And I returned to Austin in the fall of 1985, and I returned completely resolved that my future was going to be in New York, and spent the last two semesters really thinking about what I was going to do in New York, and couldn't wait to get to New York.
Speaker 1: So when you, in law school are you part of any law reviews or clinics, or clinics?  Are you doing any of that?
Speaker 2: No-- I, I, I--
Speaker 1: Okay, you're really thinking corporate.
Speaker 2: Oh yes, absolutely.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was completely thinking corporate.
Story_ID: 103224
Speaker 1: Now when you come out, what is the--so, this whole thing of the, the, the firm that you--
Speaker 2: Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton.
Speaker 1: Is, is, what is you that's what I call, we call silk stocking or you know, firm.  And how many, how many African Americans are--
Speaker 2: So there was, there were 500 lawyers, and there was, there were two of us, one in the London [England] office and one in New York.
Speaker 1: Who was the one in the London office, do you remember?
Speaker 2: I don't remember his name.
Speaker 1: That's okay.
Speaker 2: He was in London, but he left while I was there. And there was a period when I was the only black associate in the entire firm in seven or eight offices, yes.  Things have changed very much today, but at that time, it was pretty shocking.
Speaker 1: So when you--what else do I want to ask you?  So, how many are in your class that could come in with you though?
Speaker 2: At, at Cleary there were sixty-five associates in that class.
Speaker 1: So this, and what was your starting salary?
Speaker 2: Sixty-five thousand.
Speaker 1: So sixty-five, sixty-five, but that's, that's really hasn't increased since the time I--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yes, that was a big salary.  Oh, my goodness, that was in 1986.  That was a big starting salary for lawyers. I see.
Story_ID: 103058
Speaker 1: Explain the environment at Cleary [Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton].  I mean--
Speaker 2: Well, the environment at Cleary was very intellectual.  Some of the best legal work one could get was at Cleary, Gottlieb.  It was a pioneering firm in practically every practice area.  It had the most complex, sophisticated transactions, the most interesting litigation.  The tax work was the envy of Wall Street.  The environment was, in some ways, like a, a hack-a-thon of just smart lawyers thinking about disruptive, imaginative ways to make their clients' dreams possible, and, and so it was very intellectually stimulating and creative.  The people at Cleary were different.  They had gay partner.  They had, the firm was an early firm of, of Jews and Gentiles in, in, in, in an era when there were Jewish law firms and Gentile law firms, but not the two.  Cleary was one of the first.  So it was a very egalitarian, very interesting, dynamic place to work, and I loved the people. I just knew that I wasn't meant to be a lawyer.  And I was very lucky because I had an opportunity to leave Cleary, and I, because someone at Dean Witter I knew, said you should come and work here, and leave the legal work behind because it, it, it will be--you're more suited for the kind of work I do, so.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, Darren, I mean let's talk about the, the, I mean even though it has this amazing group of people, talk about the hours and--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Oh yes, well, the lifestyle was grueling because--
Speaker 1: And so talk about it.
Speaker 2: --you spent most of your time billing hours.  And what I learned at Cleary was the importance of being organized.  I learned at Cleary how a professional services organization that gives excellent client service organizes itself and how the people who work in it organize themselves, and, and I was very lucky.  I worked for Steven Feld--Steven Field [ph.]--who was partner, incredibly bright, sadly, is no longer with us, but he was, he, he was an incredible lawyer, a lovely man.  And, but he was driven, and he worked nonstop, and so that mean I worked nonstop.  And I remember a friend invited me out to Long Island [New York] for a weekend.  And I had been looking forward to it, and it was planned.  And I was taking the train, and I had everything packed and prepared.  And he called me into his office and said we've got a client who's got to have this done by Tuesday, and so I'm going to be here all weekend, which basically meant I was gonna be there all weekend too.  And it gave me a window into the world of what it was like to be a lawyer.  And I just knew that it wasn't a lifestyle that I aspired for, it just wasn't.
Story_ID: 103059
Speaker 1: And you don't really--but you've, this has been a plan for you for some time, so, the thing is, and you had planned for this.  But lawyers are not, you know, they're at the beck and call of, of their clients.
Speaker 2: Well, because you're in a professional--I mean I didn't understand.  I didn't grow up in a household or with people who, who explained to me, well, this is what a lawyer does; this is what a consultant does; this is what a professional services organization does: you serve clients you're at their beck and call.  I, I had no concept of that.  And so, for the first time, I understood what a lawyer did, what a McKinsey consultant did.  I mean I, I came to understand the marketplace and how there were clients and the people who service clients.  And I really, I think I realized that I definitely didn't want to be--I, I wanted to be the client more.  And, and, and so allowing, going first to, to Dean Witter for a short stint and then on to UBS, allowed me to make that transition.
Speaker 1: So when you, when you--I want to ask one other thing about the structure of, of Cleary [Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton].  Do they have you rotating--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --through different--
Speaker 2: Yes, you can rotate, but what happened was I really liked working with Steve [Field (ph.)], and I didn't want to do tax and so then, you didn't have to rotate.  You could rotate, and so I, Steve and I agreed that I was going to, to work with him for, I would, I would work for a year; I mean wouldn't rotate, you know, every six months.
Speaker 1: So was Steve disappointed when you said--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, Steve was, Steve was very disappointed.  But the good news is that we remained friends.  Up until he committed suicide, we remained friends, and he was really special.
Speaker 1: So that's, I mean that's a blessing.  A lot of people--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --don't hap, happen to have a partner.
Speaker 2: A huge blessing.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And also, for me, it was a blessing to be able to move away from the law at an early enough stage in my career where I wasn't labeled a layer.  Unfortunately, because the world has become more specialized, the longer you work as a lawyer, the greater, and in some ways, the more narrow your work becomes because you develop an expertise, and that's why people call on you, for a particular expertise.
Story_ID: 103060
Speaker 1: Now, now, the other question though is, you know, you're new to this city [New York City], and you had worked here once.  You had--
Speaker 2: Yes, one summer.
Speaker 1: --one summer.  So who, who have you met here that provides a network?  Because otherwise, you're working these crazy hours, be--
Speaker 2: It's interesting, I have always managed in my life to meet interesting people who lead me in wonderful, new directions in my life.  And a friend from law school [University of Texas at Austin School of Law in Austin, Texas] introduced me--so when I came to New York, I didn't know anyone.  I did know my one friend from law school, who was a New Yorker, and Peter Winfrey [ph.] is his name.  And Peter introduced me to two or three of his friends.  And it was through that network that I came to know sort of a group of people in New York who live in the city but go out to Long Island [New York] on the weekends.  So, I had a network that as emerging that way.
Speaker 1: Were these young professionals--
Speaker 2: Yes, these were, these were mostly young whites who would go to the Hamptons [Long Island, New York] and be in the city.  At the same time, a, another friend introduced me to Ned O'Gorman up in Harlem [New York], who was running the Children's Storefront School.  And, and I started going up to Harlem, and, and it was through that experience of being in Harlem that I came to know folks uptown and ultimately, through various introductions, met, met [HM Reverend Dr.] Calvin Butts, the head of the Abyssinian Church.  And that's how ultimately I found myself moving to Harlem and working at Abyssinian [Development Corporation].
Story_ID: 103061
Speaker 1: Okay, but I, I--before we get there, and I do want to get there--
Speaker 2: Sure--
Speaker 1: --but I'm just trying to understand the New York you come into, because 1980s in New York is--you get here in--
Speaker 2: I get here in '86 [1986].
Speaker 1: You get here in '86 [1986].
Speaker 2: Nineteen eighties [1980s] in New York was both exhilarating and harrowing.  It was exhilarating for me because I, as someone who arrives here with a thirst and interest in, in art, and culture, and urbanity, and modernity, to be in New York, with all of its offerings, was a spectacular sensation.  At the same time, it was harrowing because of AIDS, because of the way in which this horrific epidemic spread across the city, and the nation, and the world; and because of the ignorance that abounded about AIDS, it always hovered.  And so it was a very challenging time on one level for anyone who was gay, because that was always something you had to be mindful of.  It was also challenging because the city was racially divided in many ways.  There have been some real racial, I think, challenges that related to, you know, comments by the mayor or--
Speaker 1: This, the mayor is Ed Koch, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, indeed, indeed.
Speaker 1: You, is Bensonhurst around that--no.
Speaker 2: Bensonhurst is, is, is--
Speaker 1: (Unclear)--
Speaker 2: --(unclear)--was, was Giuli, was--
Speaker 1: Giulia--
Speaker 2: No, Gu, [Rudy] Giuliani--Bensonhurst, the first riots in the '70s [1970s] was, was the beginning of Koch, and then the other riots, which were Crown Heights, which, which was Giuliani.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.
Speaker 2: Yep, and so--
Speaker 1: But when you come in, it's Koch that's named--
Speaker 2: Yeah, when I come here, it's Koch and then [HM David] Dinkins.
Speaker 1: Dinkins.
Speaker 2: And so there were Dink--the, the ri, the Crown Heights riots happened when Dinkins--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --was mayor.
Speaker 1: Okay, so Dinkins becomes mayor in '88 [1988]?
Speaker 2: Eighty-two [1982], yeah--
Speaker 1: No, it's--
Speaker 2: --no, in--
Speaker 1: Wait, nine--
Speaker 2: No, in '90 [1990]--
Speaker 1: Ninety [1990], okay, in the '90s [1990s].
Speaker 2: Yeah, in, in--
Speaker 1: But it's after, because when you come, you know, we also have two years after you come,--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: [HM] Reverend [Jesse] Jackson's running--
Speaker 2: Yeah, exactly,--
Speaker 1: --for, for president.
Speaker 2: --exactly--
Speaker 1: So, we have--
Speaker 2: -exactly, you have all of that--
Speaker 1: --have those--
Speaker 2: --yes.
Speaker 1: --all of that's happening.
Speaker 2: So, so--
Speaker 1: And New York's a totally different place--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Oh, my goodness, New York is a completely different place.  New York, the Upper West Side is still recovering.  Harlem [New York] is just thought of as a wasted ghetto.  People talk about the community in such derogatory terms.  You would never find a white woman walking around 125th Street or at the subway stop at 116th Street at like, at night, in the '90s [1990s], well into the '90s [1990s].  And so it was a very different city.  No one even thought about Brooklyn [New York] and these places in the outer boroughs as being sort of the new places to live.
Speaker 1: And even around Time Square was scary.  It was sketchy.
Speaker 2: Oh, Time Square was very sketchy and was, was not a very desirable place to be.  And, and so, New York was just a different city.
Story_ID: 103062
Speaker 1: And when I was working at the bank, at UBS, for those seven and a half, eight years--
Speaker 2: So, so you started in 1988 at UBS?
Speaker 1: Mm-hm.
Speaker 2: Okay, and what makes you--so you join the ket--were you in the(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: I was on the trading floor doing, doing asset-backed securities, the things that I had learn to structure as a lawyer, the actual bonds, the actual securities, I was working and placing in pension funds and mutual funds at UBS.
Speaker 2: But these asset-backed securities actually ended up having a complicated--
Speaker 1: Some of them, the mortgage securities, absolutely--
Speaker 2: And, and, and the, their--
Speaker 1: --that were collateralized in very--
Speaker 2: Later.
Speaker 1: Yes, later on, collateralized in some very problematic ways, absolutely.
Speaker 2: In, In--
Speaker 1: But the early, the early "vanilla," as we call it, vanilla securities were very straight forward.  It's been, it's when they attempted to really sort of super securitize and, and create these highly complex, hard to decipher coupons and payment streams associated with, with securities that it became, with derivatives, that it became completely un, unwieldy.
Story_ID: 103063
Speaker 1: So, Darren, who, who is your network?  Who are the young people, I mean the people that you're associated with?
Speaker 2: So I am associated with people I've met through work.  So through a friend a work, I am taken to the, to the New York City Ballet.  And at, there, she introduces me to a friend who says give me your card. I'm going to invite you to come to this party.  We're starting a, a young people's committee here at the ballet.  You love ballet.  Come to this meeting.  So I went to this meeting, this organizing meeting of the junior committee for New York City Ballet, and I ended up being chairman.  How that happened, I don't know--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: When you were at UBS?
Speaker 2: Yes, when I was at UBS.  I ended up being chairman.  And so my job was then to organize more young people to come to New York City Ballet.  I joined the board of the Children's Storefront School, where there were--so through that network at the ballet and the ba--and by being the junior committee chair, there was a place on the board of trustees with much older, much more successful people.
Speaker 1: So you were able to join that board--
Speaker 2: Yes, I joined the board.  I was a member of the board at thirty-one or something of New York City Ballet.  I'm now vice chairman of the board, but I was thirty-one years old.  I wasn't rich, or I wasn't any of the requirements, I don't think.  But the same thing happened with the Children's Storefront School.  I went up; I met Ned O'Gorman--
Speaker 1: Now--
Speaker 2: --and he said you have to join my board.
Speaker 1: So who was in charge of New York City Ballet at that time?
Speaker 2: Peter Martins, Anne Bass.  On the board, Peter Martins is the executive director, because George Balanchine had passed away and Peter--
Speaker 1: He--
Speaker 2: --Martins then became--
Speaker 1: --he hadn't passed away that much before that.
Speaker 2: No, Balanchine died in '82 [1982] or '83 [1983], and Peter became artistic director, and Peter, and then the board were a number of important city civic leaders.  I, at the same time, joined the board of the Children's Storefront School.  I organized the young people's committee for the Storefront.
Speaker 1: And who was running the Storefront School?
Speaker 2: Ned O'Gorman--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --was the head of it, was the found--is the founder and was the head of it.  And so I had this amazing experience of these networks that were both black, white, gay, straight, uptown, downtown that just kept me always interested.  And it reflects I think something that I, I think is fundamental to who I am and that is my interest in people of all kinds and my fascination with, with different cultures and people from different places and backgrounds and, yeah.

Speaker 1: So your hours at the job are what?
Speaker 2: My hours at the bank are far more reasonable because it's, it operates around the markets.  So I actually have a life.  This was partly why I wanted to get out of the law and go to UBS.  So, when the trading floor comes to a close, trading comes to a close--
Speaker 1: At what time?
Speaker 2: That's at 6:00.  I mean by that, by 5:00 things are, are wrapping up, and by 6:00, 6:30 you can be out of there, no problem.
Speaker 1: So then New York becomes your oyster.
Speaker 2: Oh, my goodness, New York completely becomes, because I can go to the ballet in the evenings. I can get on the number six train and go up to 125th Street and do the after-hours tutoring or the work that I'm doing at the Children's Storefront School, or--. So I, of course, you know, my life is completely transformed.  And I, I have all this freedom and flexibility.  And I can come to, to do things, and I just--theater, dance, music, do all those things.
Story_ID: 103065
Speaker 1: And, and as I said, and then I meet [HM Reverend Dr.] Calvin Butts, and he says that I should come and help him with his vision for the Abyssinian Development Corporation.
Speaker 2: So talk about your meeting with Calvin Butts.  What, how do you meet--
Speaker 1: Oh, my goodness--
Speaker 2: --him and where?
Speaker 1: --when you--I've met, so, I met Calvin Butts--I first met Karen Phillips.  Karen Phillips came to the Children's Storefront School.  Karen was the co-founder with Reverend Butts of the Abyssinian Development Corporation.  And she came to the Children's Storefront for an event.  We had an open-house and had people from Harlem [New York].  And, and it was great for me because I got to meet a lot of people.  And Karen is the one who introduced me to Reverend Butts.  She was working as the CEO at the time.  And I initially came on just to help them think about fundraising and how to connect, because I had a lot of networks developed by then.  And they just needed some help with thinking about how to connect beyond the Abyssinian [Baptist] Church community.  So that's how I started.  And it was very informal.  It was part-time, because I, I wasn't sure what I wanted to do.  And pretty quickly it became clear that I could do a lot there, and that they really wanted me to be there.  And so Reverend Butts said to me, you can do a whole lot of things here; just come work here.  And it was very much not highly described--prescribed--but, but in some ways I think I just knew it was right.
Speaker 2: Do, Darren, let me ask you, had you tired of--I mean there is--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Oh, I was, I was completely over my time on Wall Street. I knew that my time was coming to an end.
Speaker 2: Now why is that?
Speaker 1: Because for me it was never about piling up money.  I think for many of the people I worked with, the idea of accumulating money was really important to them, far beyond just the value of the money that they accumulated.  It was, because it was a marker, an indicator of your importance and success.  If your bonus was bigger than someone else's, and if, there were just--and that war was never won. For me it was about, all right, get enough money to not worry about things month to month (laughter).  And, and so, that's what it was about for me. And, and it was never about, I want a career on Wall Street.  I knew I wouldn't have a career on Wall Street.  I knew I wanted a career, and the more boards I joined and the more work I did in the nonprofit sector, I knew that that's what, where my heart was.
Speaker 2: So, what, what other boards did you join?  And who are--because the reason I'm asking for you to give contacts for this, because investment banking is the new law.  And people are coming in, and the, and you have the Ray McGuires [HM Raymond McGuire], and you have--
Speaker 1: Of course.
Speaker 2: --and you have the Bill Lewises [HM William Lewis, Jr.], and--
Speaker 1: Bill Lewis, of course.
Speaker 2: --you have John Utendahl.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: I mean all those people--
Speaker 1: Yes.  And those, they--'cause Ray is a great friend and someone I admire greatly, for them the, the, that track, that path was something that they were very committed to.  And I'm happy and grateful, because need we Ray McGuires and Bill Lewises to be role models.  We need successful men and women on Wall Street who are African American.  And they are standing on the shoulders of Ken Chenault [Kenneth Chenault], and [HM] Vernon Jordan, and [HM] Ursula Burns.  And so many people are paving the way for the next generation.  And so, it's really important that they are there and that they are successful as they are.  But for me, that pathway was never my calling.  I knew that I wanted to do something that had a more public service mission and where making the bonus wasn't--
Speaker 2: Did you ever--
Speaker 1: --the objective.
Speaker 2: --did you ever think about going into government at all?
Speaker 1: I, of course, thought about it, yes, and, and I have--
Speaker 2: I mean at that time.
Speaker 1: --but I, at that--
Speaker 2: I'm saying--
Speaker 1: At that time, no, well, no.  I mean I--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --I, no.
Speaker 2: So, it was the Cal--it was Karen Phillips--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --Calvin Butts, and then--
Story_ID: 103066
Speaker 1: So tell, tell me what, what, when you joined, which is really Abyssinian Development Corporation, what is the--that's 1996, well, between '95 [1995] and--
Speaker 2: Ninety-five [1995], that was ninety-five [1995].
Speaker 1: Five, okay.
Speaker 2: Actually, it was, yeah, '95 [1995]--(unclear)--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Well, see, '90--you--
Speaker 2: It was '94 [1994] or '95 [1995].  I can't even remember it.
Speaker 1: Really, 'cause I have it '96 [1996].  You were thirty-six.  But anyway, when you, when you--'cause it sounds like it took maybe a year or so to--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, 'cause I took--(unclear)--well, exactly because I took a year off from UB--after UBS, and I was bouncing around, and that's when I sort of--yeah, so that's when I really started there but sort of just, but--
Speaker 1: Okay, right.  So you're, so at that point in time, what state are they in?  Because--
Speaker 2: It was a new organization.
Speaker 1: Brand new?
Speaker 2: It had been around since I believe, oh, maybe '90 [1990], I mean it, maybe five years old.  And it was in a small office in a basement across the street from the church, had a million dollar or less annual budget.  The fundraiser was a very nice church fundraiser, if you know what I mean.  The work really centered around the church and the proximate neighborhood.  And I think [HM] Reverend [Dr. Calvin] Butts's ambition was to really cover Harlem, and to have a much larger budget, and to be a force for economic and community development.  And that was the vision, and I completely bought into it.
Speaker 1: And so then how long does it take to talk about your role, because you become part of a, a triumvirate sort of, you know.  So, so, how, how long does it take, because--
Speaker 2: Oh, within a year; I mean within a year I--
Speaker 1: I mean but even the discussion about what that role would be.
Speaker 2: Well, I think part of it was they realized the thing, that there needed to be a chief operating officer, that there needed to be someone who all of the work, the program work reported to.  Karen [Phillips] was spending more time doing the external work and really wanted a partner to manage the kind of internal side of the house, the programming, the operations, and sort of allowed me to really play on my, to leverage my skill.  I mean, for example, I understand project finance because I should understand project finance after my experience.  And so there wasn't anyone who, who really had done project finance.  So, when we were negotiating the Pathmark supermarket, I knew a little bit about how you financed projects.  And, and so that was very helpful, very useful.
Speaker 1: But you had never run anything, so--
Speaker 2: No, I'd never run anything.
Speaker 1: So, so that's the challenge of--
Speaker 2: I'd, I'd never run anything.  I think, I'd never run anything, I'd never taken a management course.  I just was thrown in.  And to my mind, I just learned on the job.  And so I was, I think, comfortable multitasking and managing complexity in, in discreet ways, which you have to be able to do.  And I understood the community.  I, at this time I had moved uptown.  I, I had an uptown/downtown ability, the translation ability, etc.  I really was inspired by his vision, and so working towards all of these big projects and getting them done.  Because it was my job to make sure things got closed and that we really executed, and, and so that's what I did.
Speaker 1: Now the, the supermarket you mentioned--
Speaker 2: The Pathmark.
Speaker 1: The Pathmark, talk about that because--
Story_ID: 103225
Speaker 1: Okay, so, so, can you talk about Pathmark?
Speaker 2: Sure, the Pathmark was important because, in spite of the fact that Harlem [New York] had more people than Atlanta [Georgia], there was no supermarket in Central Harlem.  And we had been, we, meaning the Abyssinian Development Corporation, along with partners on the east side of Harlem, had been advocating for a site on 125th Street to become the site of a, of a, of a supermarket.  And after a long arduous, formidable campaign, we were able to get control of the land, the city-owned land, and to attract national supermarket chain Pathmark.  And it was transformative. It was a moment that signaled that development was going to take hold on 125th Street, and that we were going to seed all across 125th Street new, new development.  Which today, of course, 125th Street abounds in development, but in 1995, there were not many people willing to take a risk on 125th Street.
Speaker 1: When you think about that, that's just about twenty years, less than twenty years.
Speaker 2: Absolutely, less than twenty years.
Speaker 1: And then the other, 'cause I hear there's Whole Foods getting ready to go there.
Speaker 2: Oh, Whole Foods, now it's, it was a tipping point.  It, it just needed that tipping point, and once that, then Starbucks, then and it just fed on its own.
Speaker 1: So what, what did it take to get that done?  You said after much--and then I'm also thinking you had not grown up in the church and here you are--
Speaker 2: Well, two things: one, I was not a member of Abyssinian Baptist Church, in part, because I felt it was important that I not buy into this idea that my minister is the head of the business that I am in, in charge with running, because there were some behaviors on the part of some church members who worked for the development corporation that I didn't think reflected the kind of independent thought that was needed.  And, and it allowed me to have a relationship with [HM] Reverend [Dr. Calvin] Butts that was based more on the business of the development that he wanted to achieve than it was as my spiritual leader.  And it's just, it's just important to, to, to know how different the context in Harlem in the '90s [1990s] was than it is today, and that a significant part of that transformation is due to Calvin Butts's vision and Karen Phillips' very hard work and a lot of, a lot of hard work, because not everyone believed in that vision.
Speaker 1: Now were there conflicts between the three of you?
Speaker 2: Oh yes, always, in the best way for all the right reasons.  Are we moving fast enough?  Are we moving too fast?  Are we being too aggressive with city hall?  Should we be more aggressive with the bank?  Should we work harder on, on the blocks to get the residents to clean up their stoops?  I mean there was always these tensions.  Are we spending too much money?  Are we spending too little money?  Always though carried out constructively and with just the right spirit.
Speaker 1: So how much--so where is the funding coming from?  How much is coming from the government?  How much are you set to raise and--
Speaker 2: Sure, a third, a third, a third, a third government, a third corporate, a third private.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 103226
Speaker 1: So is that when you start working with the foundation community, or had you went--
Speaker 2: Yes, it was through, it was through Abyssinian [Development Corporation] that I started working with the foundation community--
Speaker 1: And so--
Speaker 2: --because developments reported to me, and I was often the person who was the primary interlocutor with our foundation funders.  And it was one of those foundation funders, [HM] Stacey Stewart, who was then president of the Fannie Mae Foundation, who is now president of the United Way of America.  Stacey is the person who recommended me, along with her colleague, Peter Beard at Fannie Mae, to Gordon Conway and Julio Lopez, who were at the Rockefeller Foundation.
Speaker 1: Oh, I see.
Speaker 2: So, I never sent a letter to the Rockefeller Foundation.  I never answered a headhunter's request.  I never had a headhunter call me about the Rockefeller Foundation, except when they were given my name by this foundation leader who recommended me.  And it was that recommend, that, that recommendation got me an appointment with the vice president [Julio Lopez] at the Rockefeller Foundation.
Story_ID: 103227
Speaker 1: So the question, so you work at Abyssinian [Development Corporation], AD, ADC, it's, does it go by ADC?
Speaker 2: ADC.
Speaker 1: Okay, you worked there how many years?
Speaker 2: I worked there seven years.
Speaker 1: Seven years, so--
Speaker 2: Six, seven years, yes.
Speaker 1: So, I mean, and what are the things that you learn from then?  I mean, first of all--
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: --could we go back to how much money was raised, a third, third, third.  How much money is raised--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: So, by the time I left, there was a $10 million a year organization that had grown from one and a half million.  And assets had grown exponentially, I mean well over into the hundreds of millions by the time I left.  But for me, going to Rockefeller [Foundation] was another one of those moments when I knew my life had, had, had changed.  Because the rarified air of Rockefeller was, in some ways, slightly academic, very elite, very I think self-assured, and confident, and rich.  I had, I had never been in an environment like that.  And I, in some ways, I later learned that not everyone who interviewed me thought I was the best Rockefeller candidate because I didn't attend private schools. In fact, I never attended a day of private school in my life.  I only attended public schools all the way through law school.  I hadn't published any academic journals.  I didn't have a Ph.D.  These were all the attributes of, of the other directors.  And so because I was hired as a, as a program director, which was a senior level position reporting to the vice president, and there was some concern on the part of, of, of a couple of people who interviewed me.  But my vice president, Julio Lopez, pushed me through.  And some of those people I think who had concerns, I think those concerns were assuaged over time and ultimately became great advocates for me.
Story_ID: 103228
Speaker 1: So what are you learning in that--I mean so what is your program area that--
Speaker 2: So what I'm learning at Rockefeller [Foundation] is an entirely new world.  I came, I joined Rockefeller as the director of the domestic program.  I had never traveled in the global South, as we call it, the developing world.  I had never been to Africa, Asia, Latin America, the places Rockefeller worked.  But I was not expected to, because I was the head of the domestic program.  But what happened was this amazing transformation, because I was exposed to our international work.  And because I was one of the program leaders, we had meetings in our international offices.  I attended conferences in other parts of the world representing the foundation.  And I began to understand how much the world was similar and how the issues that keep poor people, that marginalize vulnerable people, how consistent those issues were, how normative the patterns that I saw felt to me.  They felt--when I attended a meeting of community residents in Kibera, the largest slum in Africa, and it's in Nairobi [Kenya], residents were complaining about development pushing them out. The fact that the, the proximity of the slum now, when it was initially started, it was on a, in a marginal part of the city, and, of course, now, after all these years, it's close to downtown practically; and how, because of the land, it's become desirable, now the government and the private developers are pushing them out.  It sounded very much like a community board meeting up on 125th Street.  And I began to understand that--and see the world in a more holistic, cohesive way, to see patterns, spot patterns. But my colleagues often didn't because they were trained as domestic or international.  We were organized domestic/international and often did not talk.  And so, you have this new director who comes in and starts talking about how we should connect work in, in America with our urban work with urban work in, in other parts of the world, and that was very radical.  And I had conversations.  I wrote papers.  We really talked about these issues, such that, by the time Judith Rodin became president in 2005, she read one of those papers that I'd written where I talked about why it was important to look at cities as our future.  And we needed to look at cities in the U.S. and internationally, and she liked what she read.  And, and another idea that I thought was that the foundation should be organized, should be reorganized not in the old traditional domestic/international, but because the world was global, that we should have global teams and, and, and global programming.  And Judy agreed, and so she made me global VP.  And so I found myself in a matter of five years going from being the domestic director to being the global vice president to supervising our global health work in Asia and Africa.  This was very new, because I knew at the--I knew very little about global health, but I found myself in a, in a role of overseeing that and many other programs.
Speaker 1: But this is really somewhat unbelievable in the world of foundations--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --because foundations where they, where people source people from, I'd like you just to talk about that because--
Speaker 2: Sure.  No, it's, it's, you are right, it is unusual because most staff, and particularly leadership of large foundations, come from universities, from think tanks, from academic centers, and occasionally from, from a large international or national NGO.  And so I was an unusual hire, and I've been an unusual hire for most of my career.  And I think a part of it is because people see in me a capacity to synthesize, and an ability to see the dots that connect us, and to think in an interdisciplinary way.  And I think that in some ways I am not burdened by too much training, because I think that a lot of training can, in fact, undermine your ability to think expansively and in an interdisciplinary way.
Story_ID: 103229
Speaker 1: You were saying that Rockefeller [Foundation] was a whole new world, but you brought in it a different mindset.  But my question is: there's a lot of African Americans have not survived in the foundation environment.  And even a new way of thinking, no matter how innovative, is not necessarily seen in a productive way, because they're used to operating a certain way.  I'm just wondering how you, you know, what your, what's the first project you handled.  So you were there a total of five years, right?
Speaker 2: I was actually there--
Speaker 1: Eight.
Speaker 2: --for eight years--
Speaker 1: Eight years, okay.
Speaker 2: --because I was vice president for five years.  But I should say that I had tremendous support for some of the ideas that I brought forward, and they were trustees who were very supportive of me, beginning with Johnnetta Cole.  Johnnetta Cole was a trustee of the Rockefeller Foundation when I joined the organization and was a very strong advocate for me.  She was succeeded by Ann Fudge, who joined our board, and Dick Parsons [HM Richard Parsons].  They were all very supportive of my leadership and my development.  And then I had others like Frank Thomas [Franklin Thomas] and [HM] Vernon Jordan, all of them veterans of foundation boards and of the politics of these large foundations who gave me great advice.  And without their advice, there is no way I would have been prepared to become the president of the Ford Foundation.
Speaker 1: Because it is--it's a meteoric rise, you know, from the outside.  And I'm just saying, and this--so let me ask you, did you know any of them?  Had any of them known you at the ADC [Abyssinian Development Corporation], or known of your work--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --at the ADC before coming to the, coming to the Rockefeller?
Speaker 2: Dick knew me because Dick was very involved in Harlem [New York].  [HM] Reverend [Dr. Calvin] Butts was a good friend, so Calvin Butts and Dick Parsons had a longstanding friendship.  And I probably benefited from that, as I did many of Reverend Butts's relationships.  He was very generous with his friends.  And he was a great mentor, but I came to be mentored and, and be supported by, and, and helped by a lot of people, including Dick.  And so there are people who I knew later.  When I joined Rockefeller, I met Vernon.  Although he no longer a trustee, he was still engaged in our work, and we would see him at various affairs.  And, and so he gave me advice and took me aside, took me to lunch, and, and that was a invaluable relationship.  And then I met Franklin Thomas, who is a transformative person on so many levels.  To come under the tutelage of Franklin Thomas, his wise advice, his analytical mind, his big heart and passion, I learned so much from Frank.  And now that I am sitting in the office he once occupied, it is even more of an honor to be serving the Ford Foundation as president, because I see the work that he had to do to put this organization back on track, which he did after a very challenging period and some very difficult, courageous decisions that Frank took that brought more fiscal discipline and more focus to the foundation, but in the near term did result in a significant change, a reduction in staff, a reduction in our expenditures.  But that was because Frank had a long-term vision for this institution being sustainable and being powerful into the future.  And so I am benefiting from those very courageous, tough decisions that Frank had to take.
Story_ID: 103230
Speaker 1: You know what is, I think, fascinating about this and, and the two of you--you should speak as to who Frank Thomas [Franklin Thomas] is and was.
Speaker 2: Franklin Thomas was the seventh president of the Ford Foundation, and he was president from 1979 through 1996.
Speaker 1: And he was the first African American.
Speaker 2: He was the first African-American president of a major American foundation.
Speaker 1: Right.  And you come in as the second person of African American descent too.
Speaker 2: Yes, indeed, so I am the second person of African descent, and I'm the 10th president.  But philanthropy has changed because today, four of the top ten foundations have African American presidents, the Ford Foundation, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, the Kellogg Foundation, and the Mellon Foundation.
Speaker 1: Which is groundbreaking.
Speaker 2: It is groundbreaking; it is unprecedented in the history of American philanthropy.  And the great thing is how much colleagueship and mutual admiration we feel, the four of us, for each other because we know that we have been on this journey while not always together because we were in different places and different spaces, but once each of us was named president, the outreach and support was palpable.  And just today I spoke to [HM] La June Montgomery Tabron at, at Kellogg Foundation.  I regularly speak with my friend Risa Lavizzo-Mourey and of course, [HM] Earl Lewis at Mellon is, is a, a great pal, a wonderful leader.  So, we're all, we're all in this together.
Story_ID: 103231
Speaker 1: This could hold as much as, as excitement as it was when Frank Thomas [Franklin Thomas] became, you know, head of the Ford Foundation because that was a first.  But what I also wanna ask you because, did he see himself in you at all?  And the reason I'm asking is did he not come from the Bed-Stuy [Bedford-Stuyvesant] commun-
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And could can you talk about his--
Speaker 2: Sure, Frank had a remarkable rise from a, a humble beginning in Bedford-Stuyvesant, where he ultimately went on to Columbia, one of the few African-Americans graduates of the Columbia Law School [New York City, New York] and was a senior person in the police force and, and, and it, and a highly regarded administrator, leader, who came to the attention of Senators [Jacob K.] Javits and, and [Ted] Kennedy.  And, and they both approached Frank and asked him in the wake of the riots and the aftermath of a very difficult period in the '60s [1960s] in New York if he would lead this new organization, this new community development organization.  And after speaking with the community and, and really consulting some key people in Bed-Stuy and more broadly in New York, he accepted that job and, and really created the template for what he is, a community development organization, and created the kind of template for what is the idea of bold community leadership, someone who is rooted in the community, who is authentically a part of the community, and can also translate and speak to Wall Street, and to corporate America, and to government, and someone who can navigate very, very different communities with ease, with confidence, with respect, and credibility.  So Frank has been a role model for me for many years.  I, I'm still in the training wheel phase I think of, of emulating Frank, but he's left a, a really, a remarkable legacy here.
Story_ID: 103232
Speaker 1: So I, I wanna go back a, a little.  I wanna go back to Kellogg.  But I also wanna, just a little bit, go back to ADC [Abyssinian Development Corporation] because there is a lot of belief or lore about Harlem [New York] and its redevelopment lore (I wanna say lore), that President [Bill] Clinton's presence is the reason, not the reason, but it helped--
Speaker 2: Yes--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --stimulate--
Speaker 2: --yes.
Speaker 1: --Harlem.  And so he finishes his presidency in 2001. [Rudy] Giuliani finishes his mayoralty in 2001, both of them; it's all the same time as, as 9/11.  But can you speak about that?
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: Because you were in the trenches, you know--
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: --there before, and I'm--
Speaker 2: Well, I think it is certainly fair to say that when President Clinton announced that he was moving to Harlem, it was a capstone moment for many of us who had been working to transform and re-imagine Harlem as a highly desirable place, a place that was not seen as a dysfunctional, urban, challenging place, that we would see Harlem as this, this place of opportunity, of diversity that would be desirable.  And, and what President Clinton's announcement did was to accelerate a process that was well under way.  And it, while there were some who sort of resented the way the media represented this because President Clinton was very clear that he was joining a movement that was already under way.  But the media needed I think a very succinct narrative, and Bill Clinton saves Harlem was a good one, or Bill Clinton arrives in Harlem, and it's a new day.  But he really helped to accelerate the transformation of Harlem.  There is no doubt about it.
Story_ID: 103233
Speaker 1: Okay.  I just thought that was sort of interesting to ask you.  So you leave ABC and you go into, into the Kellogg Foundation.
Speaker 2: The Rockefeller [Foundation].
Speaker 1: I mean Rockefeller, I'm sorry, Rockefeller Foundation.  And what is, what are you tasked with, you know, with the domestic?  Where, who, what had your predecessor done, and then what were you learning first and then wanting to sort of see happen?  You've already spoken about the, you know, seeing the, the similarities between domestic and international, but I want to under--
Speaker 2: Sure, no, I, I was charged with our domestic program, which included housing and community development, workforce development, civil rights, and education.  So those are the four main programs.  We worked with NGOs across the country, from Boston [Massachusetts], from the Dudley Street neighborhood [Roxbury, Massachusetts] to the community organizations in Watts [Los Angeles, California].  And the work was really exciting, very focused on the problem of, of, at the core of, of urban poverty, and, and of Rockefeller's historic role in that area, and then education.  The Rockefeller Foundation, really John D. Rockefeller, the founder, had made it possible for Spelman College [Atlanta, Georgia] to really grow and, and change in many ways to become a, a college, a first-rate liberal arts college for African American women.  So the Rockefeller family's commitment went all the way back to the 19-teens to Spelman and were very committee to what then was called Negro education and what over time became our public education reform program.
Speaker 1: And so, so that's what you, that was what--you're coming into a place then that has that agenda.  Then what do you set out after you sort of learn the ropes?
Speaker 2: Well, interestingly, my predecessor, in fairness, had really set the agenda.  And in many ways, this was my executing on her vision.  And that was a great favor to me, because coming into a foundation, never having worked in philanthropy, having the time to learn while executing was very helpful.  I'm not sure I would have been as successful if, if I'd been asked to come in, and on day one to set a vision.  I think I probably could have, but by executing, learning, making course corrections, and a strategy that was already set, I was able to determine my own sense of what works and what doesn't work based upon some of those experiments and, and investments.
Speaker 1: So, you come into an organization.  How many program officers are there?  How large is it?
Speaker 2: At Rockefeller?
Speaker 1: Mm-hm, yep.
Speaker 2: It was a third of the size of Ford [Foundation], so there were 140, 140 staff at, at Rockefeller.  I had half a dozen program officers and because most of the staff was in the international program at, at Rockefeller. But it was, again, as much culturally--I mean the, the greatest change was just culture, where, you know, while I think we were disciplined around expenses.  I mean, you know, if you, if you went over your budget, you know, it wasn't the end of the world; whereas, when you are working at Abyssinian [Development Corporation], if you spend a dollar more than was allotted all sorts of red flags would go off, and, and you were very concerned about things.  So, just the culture of, the culture of accountability when you are working on the ground on a, in a nonprofit, you have to be accountable.  People are lined up every day saying I need my housing; I want to get my child in Head Start; where do I find a job?  You promised me that my block was gonna be better, and we'd be rid of these drug dealers, or whatever it may be.  So, in real time, every day you were problem-solving around real issues.  At a foundation on Fifth Avenue you can think about those issues, and of course you want to do something.  But the urgency, unless it's self-imposed, is simply not there.

Speaker 1: Go on. So talk about the (laughter) Ford Foundation.
Speaker 2: Well, the thing that's most exciting--
Speaker 1: Why did you move over to Ford?
Speaker 2: Well, I came to Ford because Ford is America's great social justice foundation.  It's important to understand the difference between a social justice foundation and a development foundation.  A development foundation works on issues from the perspective of development economics.  At the core is the, the, the idea of, of, of improvement in the economy, improvement in income for the household, reduction of poverty.  Those things are very important and are critical, and you work on those things at a social justice foundation.  But what we also work on here at Ford is the right of the individual in a Democratic society to participate, to ensure that their dreams and aspirations, that opportunity is provided for, and that, that the constitutional and other legal rights that they possess are fully enforced and realized in the lives of people day to day.  And so, the chance to work at this amazing social justice foundation and ultimately to serve as its president is the opportunity of a lifetime, and so, the combination of mission and where we do the work we do.  So it's just, it's not just that we work on social justice; it's that we work on social justice around the world, and that is so exciting, exciting.  It's exhilarating every day to be a part of this organization.  And, and so I was lucky, very blessed to have the opportunity to come to Ford.  Now I've got to step up and deliver on, on the promise of our future.

Speaker 1: Okay, so you come in and you're head of knowledge crea--
Speaker 2: Right--
Speaker 1: --you've, you replaced--
Speaker 2: --I'm vice president for Education, Creativity, and Free Expression.
Speaker 1: And you replace Ellen--
Speaker 2: (Unclear) Burstyn.
Speaker 1: --Burstyn, who had been there for--
Speaker 2: Indeed.
Speaker 1: --some time.
Speaker 2: Over a decade.
Speaker 1: For, okay.  And so, how do you get from there to president?  She didn't get there.
Speaker 2: Well, being asked to interview for president was a surprise to me too.  And, but I was--how do I--let me explain.  I guess what I would say is that when my predecessor [Luis A. Ubinas] announced his resignation from the [Ford] Foundation--
Speaker 1: And how long he had been in the position?
Speaker 2: Six years.  And he--
Speaker 1: And that's little short of time, right?
Speaker 2: And he announced his resignation.  I was asked by the trustees to interview, to be one of the candidates. And so I was one of the candidates, and I was then asked to interview as one of the three finalists.  And I was shocked but honored, and needless to say even more shocked when I received a phone call not long after my interview that evening.  I, my interview ended at five, and at eight p.m., I received a call while I was walking my dog from Irene Hirano Inouye, our board chair, letting me know that the foundation trustees would like to appoint me president.  And I was pretty bowled over.  So I, I am still on a cloud.  I've been on a journey that has taken me over 125,000 miles in my first year as president, where I've met some of the most remarkable, resilient people in the slums of Lagos [Nigera] to the rural areas of Indonesia to the urban areas of China to the small Afro-Colombian community of Qui Doe [ph.], where 75 percent of the population in the pacific region of Colombia are of African descent, and many of them suffer.  And so, to see all of that and to see the work of our grantee partners, who are supporting, fighting for, ensuring that people participate, fully realize, and actualize their dreams and their hopes, and that opportunity abounds.  This is what we do at the Ford Foundation.  And we support visionaries.  We support visionaries working on the front lines.  We stand behind and with them in ensuring that their vision for a better future for them, and their children, and their communities is realized.

Speaker 1: So, what is the organization that you've come into as, as president as you sit here today?  How many people?  What's the budget?  What are the challenges ahead?
Speaker 2: So the [Ford] Foundation has an asset base of over $12 billion.  We have an annual budget that is about $550 million.  We have approximately 425 staff in New York and in our ten offices around the world.  The foundation's challenge is the challenge of any legacy organization with a great history and heritage of impact, and that is how do we extend to a new generation the impact that we seek to have?  And how do we refine, retool, and reboot, if you will, for a new generation of work, recognizing that many of the problems that have been with us over these past fifty years have not been solved, and that there are new problems.  Who would have thought that the Internet would become a major platform for opportunity and access?  Well, it is.  Twenty years ago we had no program; five years ago we had no program.  Well, we have to have a real commitment to understanding the Internet, to ensuring universal access, because in the 21st Century it is one place where opportunity is going to be determine and where access to it is going to be essential if you want to success and flourish in this world of the 21st Century.

Speaker 1: I want to ask you about, you know, we hear the term, we've heard the term a lot with even our president [HM Barack Obama], about the improbable journey.  And I'm wondering if you have been moving so fast--well, I'm wondering what you would say about your really improbable journey.
Speaker 2: Well, has certainly been an improbable journey.  It has been a journey that has been filled with surprises, and serendipity, and outcomes that I never could have imagined.  But it has been punctuated at key moments by the interventions of this institution.  Head Start was a program that the Ford Foundation helped to create.  I went to college on public support, the Pell Grant.  I was a graduate of a public high school, and public university, and public law school.  Public education is something the Ford Foundation has been created.  Public education is something the Ford Foundation has been committed to for over five decades.  The idea of investing in human capital, investing in creating pathways for opportunity and access for people like me, is something this institution has been committed to, has done with remarkable impact.  And so while it is true that the journey has been improbable, the Ford Foundation has been at my side, although I didn't know it, the entire journey.  And so to have an opportunity to serve this venerable institution is one that I take very seriously and that I will cherish.  But my task in the years ahead is to step up, and step out, and to ensure that we remain relevant, that we remain impactful, and that ultimately we make a difference, that we achieve and execute on our mission.  That's my job, that's my task, and I'm really excited about the next chapter in the journey.
Story_ID: 103095
Speaker 1: Okay, two more questions: What are your hopes and concerns for the African American community?
Speaker 2: My hopes for the African American community in this country is that we can overcome the historic legacy that has continued in many ways to hold us back, that has continued, while there are many, many success stories and tremendous advances within our community, we have a long way to go.  And so my hope is that we can, through dialogue, through new ideas about problem-solving for our community, and owning up to some of the stark challenges, that we can have a better tomorrow.
Story_ID: 103096
Speaker 1: And what do you want your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: Oh, I don't think about my legacy.  I think leaders who obsess about their legacy have their priorities wrong.  I want this institution to be great.  I want it to make a difference in the world.  I want people to feel that the Ford Foundation is at the forefront of making change in the world.  And if we succeed at that, I don't have to worry about my legacy.
Speaker 1: True.  What do you want people to say about Darren Walker, though?
Speaker 2: I want people to say that I have been committed to the journey for greater social justice in this country and in the world and that I have taken my passion and my commitment to that and channeled it and given everything that I can give to this institution to help it succeed, help it rise to its potential, and help ensure that the next leader inherits an even stronger institution than the one I took over.
