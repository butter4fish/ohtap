 Nykolaiszyn with the Oklahoma State University  Library. Today is Monday, July 20, 2015, and I am in Garvin County,  Oklahoma, to interview Luann Waters as part of the Cowboys in Every  County oral history project. Luann, thank you so much for joining me today.  Waters Thank you.  Nykolaiszyn Let   s learn a little bit more about you. Could you tell me the year you were  born and when you were born?  Waters I was born 1952, March 2, in Pawhuska, Oklahoma, which is in Osage  County.  Nykolaiszyn Tell me a little bit about your parents.  Waters My father is named, A. A. Sewell was what he always went by. He was  actually named after both of his grandfathers, Amgrid Asbury. Now you can  understand why he went by his initials. In fact, most people didn   t know that  the initials even stood for anything. Anyway, A. A. Sewell was a county  agent for OSU. He got his bachelor   s degree from Oklahoma A M. Later  went back and got a master   s. My mom was essentially a housewife, though  occasionally worked outside of the home. Not really until I was probably in  junior high, though, that she   d do that, but quite the homemaker. Always  had a pot of coffee on and something baked to be able to serve to guests. To  start out, we lived in town in Pawhuska until I was about four, and then we  moved actually out onto the county fairgrounds.  There was a small house right in the middle of the fairgrounds, and talk  about hog heaven for a little kid, though I had restrictions of how far I could  wander, needless to say. The county fair was in our backyard. Spring  livestock show, the International  Round-Up Club  Cavalcade, racehorses  that were wintered there every winter by people using the track that was  5  there on the fairgrounds as a training facility. Definitely not your typical  small town background, being on the fairgrounds.  We lived there until I was in the sixth grade, and then we moved to Hugo   Oklahoma  in Choctaw County. My dad was still with extension service.  We lived in town when we first moved. That was really a change. I wasn   t  used to having neighbors on either side, but it was kind of fun in its own  way. Hugo   s where I graduated from high school, and then went to school at  OSU. I know there   s a lot of gaps in there that we can fill back in.  Nykolaiszyn Well, going back to your early years in Pawhuska, your father was assigned  to Osage County?  Waters Yes. Yeah, it was his third assignment in the state. Actually, he was a native  of Arkansas. Had been in a junior college in Magnolia  Arkansas  or El  Dorado  Arkansas . Played basketball, and he got recruited and got a  scholarship to come to Oklahoma A M and was on Henry Iba   s first team  at A M. That   s what brought him to Oklahoma, but the first season that he  was there to play, tore up his knee. Back then all they did was put an ace  bandage on you and say,    Sorry, kid. You can   t play anymore.    I never  thought to ask him. You know, I   m sure that that meant the scholarship went  away but that he was able to find, you know, student jobs or something  because he stayed at OSU or what   s now OSU and finished his degree. At  first, was an ag teacher in the eastern part of Oklahoma, and then eventually  went into Extension Service. That   s where he spent all the rest of his career.  Nykolaiszyn How did he meet your mother?  Waters I   m trying to remember if he was actually working in the area of Stroud.  That   s where her family was living at the time. They met there. I   ve got one  cousin that   s old enough that before he   s gone I need to pick his brain. It   s  all those kind of questions you think,    I wish I   d asked my parents, just how  did you meet the first time?    and never thought to do that. Have a cousin  that   s old enough that he would know those stories. They met there in the  area of Stroud. Dated for a while and got married and had two sons while  they were in the eastern part of the state, Coweta, Stroud, Wagoner kind of  area. Then it was 1948 that they moved to Osage County. They were there  for a while before I came on the scene.  Nykolaiszyn You mentioned when you lived on the fairgrounds you had boundaries.  There were certain places you couldn   t go or venture out past. Can you  describe that for me?  Waters Yeah, well, as I got older, the boundaries widened. First it was within the  fenced yard, and then it was within sight of the house. That   s pretty much as  far as I was supposed to go by myself. My mom used to tell this story to  6  everybody that the dog that we got when I was, I guess, about five or so, that  she   d go out and call the dog. Whatever direction the dog came from, she  knew where I was. Then she   d have an idea of, you know, and then would  call me in. The dog   d answer quicker than I would, so she   d always call the  dog first. (Laughter)  It was a great location because I got to have a horse and had sheep for a 4-H  project. We had chickens and started out with a couple of dairy cows that  were actually my brothers   . Then I got to have a calf from one of those cows  as a 4-H project. Had plenty of room to be able to do any of that sort of  thing. Had a pet goat that had been given to me by one of the horse trainers  because they kept some goats in with the racehorses to help keep them calm.  It was kind of an ideal situation.  Nykolaiszyn Tell me a little bit about early chores growing up.  Waters You know, I was lucky on that. I don   t know that I can really say that  anything specifically were my chores, probably until once we moved to  Hugo. Then it was rather than having other people around the fairgrounds  that helped feed cattle or do that sort of thing, then it was,    Okay, you take  care of the cats and the dogs and that sort of thing.    Chickens and sheep  didn   t make the trip with us. Was supposed to take care of my horses  because when we first moved we just rented a vacant lot that was about  maybe a couple of blocks away from the house. Did that sort of thing. Then  by that age, sixth grade, seventh, eighth grade, two girlfriends of mine there  in the Hugo area had horses. As long as at least two, if not three or more, of  us were together we could go off on horseback, and we were all over the  county. I think all of our parents    thought was,    Well, safety in numbers. If  somebody gets hurt, there   s somebody else to go for help.     We were pretty well given free reign. Either that, or we took it and we just  didn   t always tell our parents where all we were going. I think that maybe a  combination of the two. (Laughter) That was a fun time, too. The boundaries  at the fairground, of course then those boundaries would modify. If the fair  was going on, you stayed in the yard, unless I was with somebody. There  were so many more people around. I think back and wonder how my mom  (she could be something of a worrier), how she managed to let me have as  much free reign as she did with all of the strangers that could be around.  Then come to find out I had lots of people watching out for me, too, that I  didn   t always know. It   s kind of like even when you were growing up in  town, you   re raised by a village because everybody keeps an eye on you.  Well, I think that happened even out on the fairgrounds as well.  Nykolaiszyn Well, you moved to Hugo. Tell me your first impressions of Hugo as a young  woman.  7  Waters First impressions was for the whole family. We moved, gosh, I think it was  in January, and it snowed. Here we   ve come from northeast Oklahoma, and  we   re used to snow. There   s maybe half inch, for sure not more than an inch  of snow, and Hugo had come to a stop, because no one that far southeast at  the time really knew how to drive in snow. We were really getting a chuckle  out of that.  Why this sticks in my brain, when we first moved, we   re getting everything  unloaded in the house. I had a pet parakeet, and the house was so cold that  we knew the parakeet wouldn   t last as we were getting moved in. That   s  how I met one of my neighbors right off the bat. Went next door, knocked  on their door, and said,    Hi, we   re your new neighbors. Can my parakeet  stay in your house until we get the heat on?    (Laughter) Still have friends  from that family all these many years later.  It was really different. We moved in 1964. Hugo had not integrated their  schools yet. It was still very definitely Little Dixie, which was way different  than Osage County at the time. That was a change. Pawhuska had had one  central grade school. Hugo had the city divided by wards. The one semester  that I was in sixth grade you only met a fairly small group of folks, but then  when you hit seventh grade and everybody went to what was then junior  high, all of those ward schools came together. That was different, just being  introduced to all that many more people at the time. It was right along in  through there that talk was finally going on in the community of,    Oh, that  they were going to have to integrate,    and difference of opinions was  something.  Overall, nice town, lots of nice folks. Things were different. Hugo, at the  time, being south of Kiamichi Mountains, didn   t get any Tulsa or Oklahoma  City television stations. KTEN and KXII out of Ada  Oklahoma  and  Ardmore  Oklahoma  were the only local stations, and we actually had  cable, which was unheard of back then. We had cable TV, and all the  stations were out of Dallas. That kind of gave a whole different view of  what news that you heard and what was going on. We had a little exposure  to a big metro area, but it wasn   t within Oklahoma that we were exposed to  by television.  School experiences, I started out in band in junior high playing clarinet  because that   s what one of my brothers had played and that   s what we had.  Then freshman year, I switched to baritone saxophone.  Nykolaiszyn Wow   Waters My band director said we had way too many clarinets, and he needed  saxophone players, and he thought that I could carry the baritone saxophone,  (laughs) which I now look back on. I think that was a compliment.  8  (Laughter) I really enjoyed it because by playing saxophone I got to be in  stage band in high school as well as marching and concert band. Band was a  wonderful experience. It was like our own particular club, and it went across  grades. It wasn   t just the people from your own class so that you met other  people within the school. That was an experience, too.  Nykolaiszyn Any other activities you participated in? Were you still involved in 4-H?  Waters Up through junior high, was still in 4-H. They didn   t really have a high  school program. This predated when girls could be in FFA. Interests  switched, even stronger to horses. I still had that interest all the way through.  Well, still do, though had my last horse now probably thirteen years ago.  Still have an interest in horses. Was in science club, band. Band took a lot  time, being in all the different areas of that. Horses and band was a whole lot  of   did lots and lots of reading. I   ve always been a big reader. Beyond  those, with extra competitions or field trips and things that we got to do  within that.  Nykolaiszyn You were the baby of the family?  Waters Baby of the family.  Nykolaiszyn Did your brothers go to college?  Waters Yes. Oldest brother graduated from Oklahoma State. The other brother went  there up to what would have been his senior year but then moved to  Arizona. Never did complete a degree. In fact, I always tell people I grew up  in a household that OU stood for    other university   . (Laughs) My dad was  on the board of directors for the Alumni Association. At least two different  years (I think this was when I was in high school) he had 100 percent  membership for any OSU alum in Choctaw County. He had them all as  members of the Alumni Association, and that was really a star, as far as he  was concerned, because there wasn   t any other county that had ever done  that. I   d be curious to find out if any county   s done that since. That was  something that, anything OSU related. As far as other activities, if there was  a home football game, we went all the way from Hugo to Stillwater. This  predated Indian Nation Turnpike.  Nykolaiszyn Wow   Waters You   re talking easily five-hour drive. Especially for him to make the alumni  meetings, which usually, I think, started at nine, ten o   clock in the morning,  that it wasn   t at all unusual that we were leaving the house at five in the  morning to get there for the meetings and then would stay for a football  game. They   d always have those the time of home games. Then we   d make  a different route on the way home and go by way of Oklahoma City because  9  my mom, one of her sisters lived in Midwest City. We   d stay with them on  Saturday night, get a good family visit in, be home by Sunday night. I can  still remember doing homework sometimes on the way home with, used to  still have lights that would turn on under the dash, not just the dome lights. I  would be finishing homework on the way home on Sunday nights  sometimes, because I   d put it off until then.  Yeah, went to OSU a lot. Oldest brother is twelve years older. Was twelve.  He just passed away a couple of years ago. Was twelve years older than me.  The other brother was eight years older. Even by the time that they were in  college, yeah, I was getting lots of exposure to OSU. In fact, I hadn   t  realized at first. My freshman year, I had a couple of people in my dorm that  kept coming and asking me questions about stuff on campus, and I was like,     What? Why do you keep asking me that kind of stuff? I   m a freshman,  too.    They went,    Really? We thought you knew where everything was,  where all the buildings were and all that sort of thing.    I said,    No, that   s  just because I   ve been coming up here for so long.    Class questions, I  couldn   t answer necessarily, because that kind of stuff, I hadn   t gotten into  yet.  Nykolaiszyn Did you always know you were going to go to college?  Waters Pretty much. I think if I had said for some reason I didn   t want to go to  college, that probably would have been all right, but interests that I had early  on, probably by sixth grade, maybe even earlier, I thought I wanted to be an  archaeologist. Then on into high school, I started thinking about,    Well, no,  maybe a veterinarian.    I actually, when I enrolled, was a pre-veterinary  major in the College of Arts and Sciences.  I actually did talk to, I don   t remember if he was a dean. He was high up in  the College of Agriculture. Visited with him. Questions that he asked me  then would have gotten him in a lot of trouble now. It was like,    Well, why  are you wanting to be a veterinarian? If you do make it into vet school,  you   re keeping a space from a young man. You   ll want to stop being a vet  and have children,    on and on and on, and I thought,    I think I   m glad I   m in  the College of Arts and Sciences.    (Laughs) I did talk to College of Ag, but  yeah, I thought that was pretty strange at the time. It was basically 1970, and  those kind of things were still being tossed out there.  Nykolaiszyn Did you look at any other schools outside of OSU?  Waters No, it pretty much, if I was going to go to college, that   s where to go,  especially if I was going to become a veterinarian that, yeah, go to the  college that   s in your home state, because it   s harder to get into vet school  than it is med school. It was close enough. I didn   t have my own car, but I   d  10  get to see my parents, because they   d be up for every home football game.  (Laughs) It was the logical choice, and it was further away from home.  Most of the people that I was in high school with that went to college went  to Southeastern  Oklahoma State University  at Durant  Oklahoma . That  was as far away from home as most of them had ever been. I can still  remember there was one fellow that, another gal and I and this guy when,  maybe it   s when we went to take our ACT test. We were outside of the  county, and other than when he was in football and was on a bus going to  games, it was the only time, as I recall, that he had been outside of the  county on his own. That seemed unusual to me, too, but he probably wasn   t  the only one, just the one that I knew of. OSU was, I knew that   s where, if I  was going to go to school, that   s where I   d go.  Nykolaiszyn What year did you graduate high school?  Waters Nineteen-seventy.  Nykolaiszyn Then you enrolled at OSU?  Waters Yeah.  Nykolaiszyn Where did you live on campus that first year?  Waters Actually first two years, Wentz Hall, tenth floor, and really enjoyed it. It  was different. Again, closer company than what you   re used to, and you  have some neighbors that are mindful of that you   re trying to study or  you   re trying to sleep. There   s others that, by the time they made it back to  the dorm, they were still in a party mode. Overall, it actually went pretty  well, and I enjoyed being in Wentz.  Nykolaiszyn What was the campus atmosphere like in the 1970s?  Waters I think in the early 1970s everybody was trying to decide,    Do we want to  be rebellious like we hear that they   re being everywhere else?    That even  started in high school. I wore my hair long and straight and might  occasionally have a sarape vest on or one thing and another. Later years,  friends said,    Oh yeah, you were our resident hippie for our high school.    I  thought,    Whoa, you haven   t really seen hippies if you thought I was the  resident hippie.    Somewhat questioning. Still very middle America. More  conservative, but a lot of people bringing up questions of,    What are we  doing to the environment? What are we doing to each other?    Some of those  kind of things were going on.  Young women especially were, you know, finding more freedom than  they   d ever had a chance to experience before and learning how to modify  11  that and not get yourself in trouble. Overall, a good atmosphere of, pretty  cohesive. Still you saw a difference between, as we were all referred to and  called ourselves GDIs versus sororities and fraternities, but I had lots of  friends in both of those. My oldest brother, well, actually both brothers, the  oldest brother had been a Kappa Sig. Yeah, you found a little difference of  opinion in backgrounds but usually on a friendly rivalry sort of thing, on-campus,  off-campus approach.  Nykolaiszyn Kind of walk me through how you chose your major, because it did change.  Waters Yeah. Was pre-veterinary, in Arts and Sciences but also was interested in  history and arts. Of course had to have a certain amount of humanities kind  of things, too, and was staying with the pre-vet until chemistry. I found that  we didn   t necessarily get along, and I still was considering pre-vet but really  sat and looked at my options of what else did I want to do and decided that  for me to make it into vet school I was going to have to give up all of these  other things that I felt were as important to me as vet school. I switched to  what was then a zoology/wildlife option major. The semester, I think, after I  graduated wildlife became its own standalone major. Then from pre-vet  went in definitely into the zoology department and was doing classes in  wildlife ecology. Was still within the science field, still animal-related, and  went along with that option. Didn   t have to take very much more chemistry  after that, which was a bright spot. (Laughs) Still had some hard classes but  things that my brain wrapped around easier than it did with chemistry.  Nykolaiszyn Any classes or professors that just really stand out in your mind?  Waters Yeah, Dr. Bryan Glass. I took mammalogy with him. He had forgotten more  about mammals than I could ever hope to know. The one thing I remember  about him in class one day, he forgot his notes, and rather than going back to  his office, he said,    Well, what we   re covering today I can do without my  notes.    Well, we decided after that if he ever forgot his notes again, we were  going to make him go get them because since he was doing things literally  from memory he was going much faster with what all he was talking about.  We couldn   t keep up with him, on trying to take notes on whatever it was.  I thought,    Man, this guy, he   s got knowledge that is just beyond and good  life experiences    because he had been in Africa doing collections and all  sorts of things. He was a really nice man, and later when I worked for the  university, you know, I considered him a friend. I mean, he was still,    Oh,  you had been my professor    kind of approach but was a real sweetheart. So  Dr. Glass.  My adviser when I switched into wildlife ecology was Ted McKinney. He  was a great professor. Later, after he   d left Oklahoma State, he got involved  in political aspects and actually ended up spending time in prison.  12  Nykolaiszyn Oh my   Waters I don   t know what happened to him after that, because he and some other  people were doing a protest at some power plant or something. He was a  wonderful wildlife professor whenever I   d had him, and I think his  encouragement was one of the reasons that I enjoyed the wildlife field, of  going into that for a major. Let me think, any others? Oh, I   m trying to think  of my humanities instructor because she was another one that I was  impressed with, her field of knowledge and her openness to other cultures.  Conway   s coming to mind, but I don   t think that   s correct. Yeah, she was  amazing. Let me think, who else? For undergraduate, probably those would  be three of the ones that would really stand, but had a lot of really good  classes. Myr Lou Rollins was, I don   t know if you would have   .  Nykolaiszyn Dance instructor.  Waters Dance instructor, yeah. Myr Lou Rollins, when I was a freshman, women  still had to have physical education. It used to be ROTC for the guys and  physical education for the girls. Well, ROTC had been dropped as a  requirement for the men by the time I was a freshman, but the women were  still required to have physical education. That was one of the protests that,  by the end of my sophomore year, of course after I had met all the physical  education requirements, that requirement got dropped. That seemed to  happen to me a lot. (Laughs) I   d get all the requirements, and then they   d  change them.  I took modern dance as my required physical education class with Myr Lou  Rollins. I loved it because when I had been little, I took tap and ballet and  had been introduced to modern dance about my junior year in high school  by my physical education teacher. I thought,    Oh, this is a class I want to  take.    Well, I enjoyed it so much then I took another class with her and took  another class and was in the spring dance concerts for forever, it seemed  like. Just kept going back and really, really enjoyed those. She was an  excellent instructor.  Nykolaiszyn Was there a particular building you   d have the majority of your classes in,  or were they just all over the place?  Waters Oh, for sure by sophomore year, Life Sciences West, and I always thought it  was funny when I   d be back home and somebody would say,    Oh, well, my  sister   s daughter is in school at OSU. Have you met her?    I   m thinking,     What did she major in?       Well, she was a business major.       Well, no     because that was on the far other side of campus from where I was all the  time. Especially once you got into your major classes, you were pretty much  in one or two buildings. It was like,    Oh, that   s the other side of campus. I  13  don   t know anybody over there.    Yeah, Life Sciences West. Gosh, it   s been  in my OSU experience since day one, because then later when I worked for  the university, I was officed in Life Sciences West as well.  Nykolaiszyn Well, you lived two years in Wentz. Where   d you round out?  Waters I moved off campus. Lived in a little triplex house apartment. There was one  apartment upstairs, two downstairs, and with a girlfriend that I had met,  gosh, was it just the summer before or two summers before? She was from  Skedee, Pawnee  Oklahoma  area. We   re still best friends. We decided we  wanted to live off campus and found this little place on Husband Street. It  was close enough that we could walk and/or ride our bikes, because neither  one of us had a car. We weren   t all that far away. There was still a Safeway.  I think it   s Hastings Books, maybe, is where the Safeway store used to be.  She had a red wagon that we would go to the grocery store and load all the  groceries in that red wagon and then tow them back home. If we had  anything that was too heavy or needed to get a lot of stuff, the guys that  lived across the street from us would give us a lift wherever we needed to  go. Worked out pretty nice. Was there on Husband Street for basically a  year and a half because I managed to get out a semester early between two  sessions of summer school and doing one intercession and had one semester  that, by luck, it was just random who ended up in a special section of  freshman English, English 1113, I think.  They experimented, I guess, for a couple of semesters in that you had the  option of contracting to do not just three hours but could do six or even nine  hours of English credit and that you did whatever research paper or  whatever was required in the other classes, though you still met the same  hours of class. You just did essentially, I don   t know if it was even really  outside assignments, that they just kind of mixed it all in, partly from, what I  understood, was to see how many students would even take advantage of it.  I thought,    Gosh, get nine hours instead of three?    Yeah, I mean, you paid  for the hours, but then you weren   t having to do those other semesters. I  contracted for nine and got them. That semester, instead of sixteen hours     credit, it was way more. All of those things combined, I managed to get out  a semester early. Got out in December. Had one more hour than I needed for  my bachelor   s and had four hours towards graduate credit and was a nervous  wreck about the last month of the semester because I thought,    They   re  going to come back and tell me,    Oh, we   re sorry. We made a mistake. You  need to take one more class.        In fact, a story that I   ve shared with lots of folks through the years, I was  using a student loan to go to school and had gotten a letter that all of us that  had student loans were supposed to come into whatever office and talk about  our student loans. Well, that letter didn   t specify that we might have to or  that we were expected to pay insurance for once we graduated, that if  14  something happened to us that the university still got paid back or whoever  was, the payment was going to. When I went to this meeting, I didn   t have a  checkbook with me and was trying to explain to the person. I said,    Well, I  can go get my checkbook. I need to call my parents. Then I   ll come back  and do that.    Well, luckily I don   t remember the fellow   s name, but he was  the boss over all these people. He was walking through and heard me say  something about leaving, and not paying was I think all that registered with  him. He blew up at me,    When are you students going to expect to follow  your responsibilities?    and on and on and on.    You don   t do this, you won   t  graduate.    Well, what I heard was,    You won   t graduate,    and by the time I  got back to my apartment and called home, I guess I was pretty much a  basket case because later my mom said,    I kept talking to you on the phone.  I was afraid to let you get off the phone.    I had sounded so distraught, but  she finally had me calmed down. Then she called my dad.  Well, with my dad being a director on the Alumni Association, he knew  who to call, and he started with Dr. Kamm, who was president of the  university at the time. Basically, you know, kind of said,    Bob, what   s going  on up there?    (Laughs) I   m sure in not that mild of language. They were  friends enough that he said, well, that he   d check on it. Come to find out I  hadn   t been the only student that this guy had kind of ragged on with,    Who  do you think you are?    kind of thing. Anyway, I don   t know that it cost him  his job, but I guess he got a reprimand out of it. I still paid my insurance and  still graduated, but there for a few days I was a puddle of confusion and  distraught and whatever. (Laughs) Did get finished in December.  Back then they didn   t do December graduation ceremonies. I would have  had to have gone back in May, and I thought,    I   m too busy. I   m not going  to bother to do it.    Just didn   t go through graduation ceremonies at that  point. Then started a summer job and went on from there. I think back.     Would I have wanted to put myself through that again?    I thought,    Yeah     because I got out of school and I had other experiences that spring that I  would have missed out on otherwise. Later, when I was an adviser, I helped  students figure out could they manage to get out a semester early or were  they better not to for classes that they were expected to take and some of  those kind of things. Yeah, all these many years later, that all still sticks in  my brain, too.  Nykolaiszyn Did you have an on-campus or off-campus job while you were a student?  Waters Several different ones when I lived in Wentz. I was a desk clerk for a while.  Trying to remember, it would have been after I was living in my apartment,  I worked part-time for one of the faculty members, basically doing a lot of  dishes. He was doing water research. Any of his collection vials and things  had to be washed multiple times and finally with distilled water so that it  wouldn   t have an impact on his studies. Did that sort of thing, and then later  15  was a teaching assistant. Maybe not my freshman year, as far as an on-campus  job.  For a while I even took in ironing, and I thought,    Oh, I hate this. I   m not  getting paid enough to make it worthwhile.    That was when, way before  most wash-and-wear kind of stuff. Tried that for a while and decided I could  find something else. Did some babysitting, a collection of things to help give  a little bit of supplemental income. Being a desk clerk was fun. Actually  even enjoyed the job working for the professor just because it gave me a  whole other view of what all could be involved with science, too. Yeah, I  always seemed to be working part-time.  Nykolaiszyn Were you involved in any on-campus organizations?  Waters There was a ZPG group, Zero Population Group that I was involved with  them. Was a member of Sierra Club for a while and actually continued with  the Sierra Club when I lived in Tulsa, later. I   m trying to think of any others.  We had a students    group, Zoology Undergraduate Students    Organization,  ZUSO. That predated now or when I was there as an advisor, they had the  Wildlife Society group, which they still do, the student chapter of the  Wildlife Society. Since we didn   t have a full wildlife major yet, it was  everybody within zoology. One thing I really remember about it, we got to  do a field trip to the St. Louis Zoo, because I   d never been there before. That  was really a neat experience to get to do that. Did that sort of thing, too.  Nykolaiszyn What did you do for fun?  Waters By my junior year in college I actually had even managed to get two of my  horses moved to OSU. Had to ride my bike a couple, three miles to get to  the pasture where I kept them. When I told my adviser I was going to get to  bring my horses to school, he was like,    Well, there went your grades.    If  anything, actually, my grades got better because I got better about  scheduling my time, of making sure that I had to have the studies done  before I could go have the enjoyment of going horseback riding. I think that  getting out, and being away from campus and all, helped clear my head to  keep the studies going better, too. Did that sort of thing. Go to dances a lot.  Love to dance. I guess that   s, yeah, that   d be a lot of it. Football games, I  mean, I always enjoyed going to the football games with my folks.  Occasionally made it back to Hugo, pretty much just Thanksgiving break,  fall break, and then the break in-between semesters.  Nykolaiszyn How would you get home?  Waters Usually I   d either catch a ride with somebody else that was headed back that  way because there were a few other folks from Hugo that had come to OSU.  We   d bum a ride with them, and depending on how it worked out, I don   t  16  remember my folks ever had to come and pick me up other than when I was  moving out of the dorm or moving in kind of thing or to the apartment.  Yeah, we   d just catch rides with somebody else. Checked once about trying  to use the bus, and bus service back then, it was going to take about thirteen  hours, as I recall, because they were going to stop in every little town  between. I never rode the bus. Called and checked on it once but never did  that. Decided no, I could stay at OSU or wait and see the folks when they  came up for football games. (Laughs)  Nykolaiszyn Tell me the year you graduated.  Waters High school, 1970. Got out in December of    73, as far as finishing  undergraduate. That spring was back at Hugo, I actually helped establish a  4-H horse club with a wonderful group of gals, because I thought I could  maybe be a leader for them. Some of the things they were wanting to learn I  wanted to learn as well. I applied for a summer job with Federal Service and  ended up getting a job with US Army Corps of Engineers at Hugo Lake  when Hugo Lake was first becoming a lake. In fact, that summer, the  summer of    74, the lake wasn   t even supposed to be full yet. They just  closed the dam, the gates on the dam that, oh, that January or February. It  had been estimated it would take three years for it to fill, and it was full by  May.  Nykolaiszyn Wow.  Waters It was probably one of the, maybe not the rain like we   ve had in this past  month but still a lot more rain than what had been expected. That was one of  the reasons they decided they needed a couple of park technicians. Park  areas weren   t even finished yet, but people were already using the lake.  They wanted some extra presence to get to visit with the public and advise  them of what regulations there were and that sort of thing. Did that for the  summer. Found out there was a good chance of getting on permanent. I had  planned on going back that fall to work on a master   s and thought,    Good  chance at a job. Maybe take the job. Worry about the master   s later.    I did  get hired on permanent. That fall, was still at Hugo Lake, and then January     75, then moved to Tulsa and worked in the district office. Did a change in  direction at that point, as far as, wasn   t immediately back at OSU.  Nykolaiszyn Well, kind of take me through your career after landing in Tulsa.  Waters Landed in Tulsa. Was biological technician, park technician, biological aid,  I guess, as far as technical title. Biological aid, park technician that summer  and fall. Applied for a real estate training program within Tulsa district  office is what got me to Tulsa. Worked in that. Gosh, was there three or four  of us that were starting out as trainees in that program and did that for a  while. Then found out there was a chance of going into personnel work as a  17  trainee. Applied for that and got it. Did that switch. Still within Tulsa district  office. It was like each one of these moves I was having less competition  because there were fewer of us going in. Worked my way through all the  different branches within personnel. Was able to get promoted pretty much,  a lot faster than I would have otherwise on grade level that I worked. Was in  Tulsa district office from January of    75 until March of    79. August of    76,  had gotten married and continued working in Tulsa, though I was  commuting then from Tulsa to Morrison, northeast of Stillwater until, I  think it was December of    78 that we bought a house out in the country.  I was actually fifteen miles closer to Tulsa and had ended up even in a  carpool. Was still doing personnel work, but when it got to a point, for a  variety of reasons, that the only good part of the day was the drive to and  from work, I thought,    It might be time to look to do something different.     Then at that point considered going back to school at OSU to work on a  master   s. Quit in March and started back to school in June working on a  master   s in science education. I had checked with what were the different  options. Here I had a zoology/wildlife degree. Now married. Knew that it  wasn   t like I was going to get to go off and work in the wilds of wherever  because of husband   s career as well. I thought,    How can I use my science  degree?    Found that I could get a master   s in science education and get a  teaching certificate and be able to teach. Decided to go for that option. First  went back just to see about getting the classes I needed to get teacher  certification and luckily got an adviser that said,    Well, you know, you  could take graduate-level classes to meet all of those requirements and get a  master   s at the same time.    I went,    I like the sound of that     (Laughs)  Nykolaiszyn Oh yeah   Waters That worked great. Started in on that approach. Was full-time in school that  summer and fall. That fall, heard that there was an opening for an adviser in  the zoology department for the wildlife majors. I thought,    What the heck?  Go interview. See if I can maybe get that    and did. Started in that position,  full-time adviser, which is actually, was the first full-time adviser the  zoology department had ever had. They   d always had faculty, or the person  that had been in the position before I was was just part-time.  One of the reasons I heard they decided to get somebody full-time and to  have it not be just be faculty members, they realized they had had some of  their wildlife majors as seniors that had as many as four and five advisers. It  wasn   t the students changing majors. They   d get assigned to a faculty  member, and that person would get to go on a sabbatical or whatever  different kind of situations. They were changing advisers so often it was like  they didn   t even know who to go see.  18  Sometimes faculty, because they were faculty first, didn   t keep up with what  the requirements were.    Oh, your student can   t do this,     or    Well, you can  substitute this.    It was costing the students some hours and some money  because they were maybe taking a class that didn   t meet requirements. I  started as an adviser in January of 1980 full-time. Worked out nice, though,  because then my tuition went to half cost.  Nykolaiszyn Oh yeah   Waters It slowed me down a little bit on finishing the degree, but it was worth it for  the difference in price. Did go ahead and finish the master   s in science ed.  Nykolaiszyn What year did you finish up that degree?  Waters Actually completed, had all the coursework, I think, finished by the end of  spring semester of    81 but then didn   t do my comps until that summer. Was  actually a summer of    81 graduate. Part of the reason we put the comps off  was that they were going to happen right at the same time that my son was  due to be born. Decided if I hadn   t had him yet I wouldn   t feel like sitting  through comps and if I had already had him I wouldn   t feel like sitting  through comps. (Laughs) Delayed it until that summer. That worked out all  right, too.  Nykolaiszyn How long did you remain at OSU?  Waters Was an adviser from January of    80 until December of    84 when we moved  down here. I had several students that were going to be graduating that  following May. We made sure that we had graduation requirements met,  signed off on for everybody. Students that had even started as freshmen the  fall of    80 had me as their adviser all the way through and had all their  paperwork signed so whoever came in after me couldn   t throw them for a  curve. I felt like that I hadn   t left them out short.  Nykolaiszyn What brought you down to Garvin County?  Waters My husband   s job. He is also an OSU graduate. He had been ag econ major  and had gone into baking. Banking, not baking. I do the baking. He   s a  wonderful griller. He   s a great cook. He was in banking and had the  opportunity to come down here to be president of a bank. The bank where  he had been working in Morrison, he knew he was never going to get to be  any higher up in it because there was the guy that owned the bank and then  the vice president under him so that even when the owner would retire, that  he   d still not ever get to be any higher than a vice president. Well, we  moved down here in December of    84, actually the day before Christmas.  He had actually started commuting or was coming down here starting in  19  November. Then I was able to finish out the semester, and then we moved.  He   s still with that bank now thirty years later.  Nykolaiszyn Wow   Waters Actually over thirty years now. The change in his job was what brought us  down here.  Nykolaiszyn Is it the bank in Wynnewood?  Waters It   s the State Bank of Wynnewood. There is another bank in town that   s, he  likes to kid them. They are a branch now. When we first moved down here,  they weren   t a branch of another bank, but they are now. There was also a  savings and loan that was here when we first moved down. Yeah, the State  Bank.  Nykolaiszyn When you moved to Garvin County, what were you getting involved with  down here?  Waters Well, when we first talked about coming down here and he mentioned  Wynnewood, I tell people that I   d never even heard of it until we moved  here. As an interesting side note, after we had been here for, oh, probably a  couple of years, digging back through old family photos, found a picture of  my grandparents. It   s labeled on the back. It was their second date. There   s  three other people in the picture with them, and it was taken in Wynnewood  Indian Territory. (Laughs)  Nykolaiszyn How about that?  Waters There was a connection that I just hadn   t known about yet. I found out my  mom   s oldest sister was actually even born in Wynnewood. Yeah, small  world. When we first moved down here, once getting settled in and keeping  up with, at the time, a three-year-old (turned four shortly after we were  down here), I thought,    Okay. I   m in Garvin County. I have a son to take  care of. What can I do with my degree and my background?    I went and  talked to the local paper. At whatever point, I   d have to look back at records  to see. Asked them if they   d like to have a wildlife column. They were like,     Well, we   ve never done anything like that, but write us a couple. We   ll see  what the response is.    I did one about winter birds and a couple of other  things. What people I had met, I called all of them, and I said,    Please call  the newspaper and tell them you like the column.    They must have gotten  good response besides whatever I sent to them as well. Then for, oh gosh,  I   d have to look back and figure out for sure how long I did a weekly  column on things relating to wildlife and the outdoors.  20  Actually doing that, I then found out, I applied to Outdoor Writers  Association of America and qualified for requirements. I   m still a member  of that, though I still don   t do regular writing. Because of classes and/or  speaking programs and things that I do, still qualify as a member all these  many years later, too. So still kind of kept my hand in the whole wildlife  thing. Gosh, for a while, made seemed like a lot of trips back to Stillwater to  stay connected with folks. Then completely made the transition on down  here. That August after we had moved here, my dad passed away. Then  that   s probably even what made me then be commuting to Hugo, to help my  mom with things. That made a difference then, too, being back and forth  over there a lot, too, at least closer than what it had been when we were  living at Morrison. I   m trying to think if there were other things now. Yeah,  between working on the column and keeping up with the youngster   I did  have horses here with me. Then wasn   t long after that that was going back  and forth to Hugo a lot.  Nykolaiszyn Tell me a little bit about your work with OLLI  Osher Lifelong Learning  Institute .  Waters OLLI has got to be one of the best things that   s ever happened for anybody  over fifty. Actually, even before OLLI, when I was working in Oklahoma  City for the State Wildlife Department (I started to work in them in August  of    87). In    89 or    90, somewhere along in through there, I heard that OU  had just seminars, one-time seminars that were called    Mornings with the  Professor    on Tuesday mornings. I   d even take a morning off from work,  would drive north, stop at OU, listen to an hour and half lecture, and then  would go on up to the office. That was almost an introduction to OLLI   like  because OU still does that as part of their OLLI program now.  Then when I found out about OLLI classes, this was after I was, had quit  working at the wildlife department. Actually, it would have been earlier than  that when I went to the seminars. Anyhow, I thought,    These sound  interesting.    Went and took a class, and I thought,    Really enjoy this.    My  idea is you never quit learning until you   re dead, or if you think you don   t  need to learn anything else, you might as well be dead. (Laughs) Took the  OLLI classes. After taking two or three classes, I went into their director,  and I said,    You know, I offer programs in things that I think will fit as an  OLLI class. Do you have to be on faculty at OU?    Everybody I   d had as an  instructor had been on faculty. They said,    No, we   re open to anybody that  wants to do a topic.    I actually taught for OU OLLI before I taught for OSU.  Now when I had been working with the Wildlife Department, RuthAnn, that  is head of OLLI, now had been doing education outreach. Between Leopold  Education Project classes or other things that RuthAnn and I had worked  together a lot. When she found out I was teaching for OU OLLI, she was  like,    Whoa, wait a minute. You need to teach for OSU OLLI.    Whatever  21  year that they started doing classes in Oklahoma City, I was one of the first  instructors there, and we were happy when we had six people enroll in a  class. Much, much bigger program than that now. I was a volunteer at the  Oklahoma History Center as well. I got to count my hours when I was  teaching because they were history-related topics. Since it was being held at  the History Center, I got to count my time of teaching for OSU OLLI as my  volunteer hours there at the History Center. I   ve done, well, sometimes  multiple because we do about a two-year rotation. Teach a class, wait a  couple of years, then offer it again, Lewis and Clark, Chisolm Trial,  cemetery symbols class, pioneer food history, or even just a standalone  Dutch oven cooking class.  Have done all of those. I   ve done the cemetery symbols class, actually, at  Stillwater one semester. All the rest of it   s either been at the History Center.  One time at Epwoth Villa. I   m scheduled to teach cemetery symbols this fall  for OSU OLLI at the History Center. Also do journaling classes is one other  topic that I   ve done. I keep telling myself I   m working on two more topics,  of, one on Beatrix Potter and one on Laura Ingalls Wilder. Just haven   t  gotten to the point that I feel like I   m ready to do those yet for anybody else.  Still doing research on those areas. Beatrix Potter, what I   m wanting to  cover on her is not, well, yeah, we   ll talk about the children   s books, but that  she was quite the naturalist and one of experts in England on studying fungi  and did some amazing drawings. It   s more for her naturalist aspect and her  then being a farmer in her later years. All those farms that she owned, all  were donated to, it   s like, National Trust. You can still go visit her farms  even still today, and they look like when she was there. I   m intrigued with  that history as well as the naturalist aspect of those.  Nykolaiszyn You   re still staying very busy, still educating.  Waters Still educating, yeah, sharing what I   ve learned with other people or learning  more on my own. Still taking OLLI classes myself and have really enjoyed  those. Yeah, there   s always something new to learn. It   s one of the reasons  I   ve got so many books. (Laughs) Yeah, avid reader.  Nykolaiszyn Well, tell me a little bit about your son.  Waters My son was born in March of 1981. He also went to OSU but didn   t  graduate from there because he met his, actually, now, his first wife. They  got married or were wanting to get married. Knew they had gotten involved  with a church or were active in a church in Pauls Valley, and they thought,  well, if they transferred to OU to finish their degrees, they could live in  Pauls Valley, be involved with the church, and commute to classes. I can  still remember when he came home to    Mom and Dad, I need to visit with  you. I   m wanting to transfer to OU.    I normally don   t have a poker face, but  that one day, I think I did.  22  When he went through the whole explanation, I looked at him, and I said,     Well, son, you can   t go to OU.    He was like,    Why not?    I said,    Nobody  from our family   s ever gone to OU.    (Laughs) He graduated from OU, but  his heart   s still with OSU. He keeps saying he   s considering maybe going  back for a master   s, if he can in and around work, and get it through OSU  since it   s a family tradition. He was in school at OSU. Then graduated at  OU. Lived out in California for a while. Has been back in Oklahoma now  for a couple of years. Had gotten divorced but remarried this past spring.  He   s quite happy living in Stratford and works at the State Bank of  Wynnewood, another family tradition, going along those lines.  Nykolaiszyn Your only child?  Waters Yes. Yeah. Only one. Told everybody when he was little it was all I could  do to keep up with him. (Laughs) Didn   t want to try and keep up with any  others. He   s real active in community aspects. Does programs at the schools,  sometimes bank-related and other aspects. Is currently president of our local  historical society. I think that   s how I maybe got roped into be  secretary/treasurer for the local historical society. (Laughs)  Nykolaiszyn It could very well be. (Laughs)  Waters Yeah, I think it had a big aspect of it. Yeah, we both enjoy history. That   s a  big thing about that. He   s a really good public speaker, very enthusiastic. I  love hearing compliments on him. He is, I think, a special young man,  though I know I am prejudiced. Yeah.  Nykolaiszyn Well, could you talk a little bit about how attending OSU had an impact on  your life?  Waters Oh, definitely  Actually it even goes back before I actually got to OSU,  programs like 4-H that goes through OSU. In fact, I still share with young  people to do, be it 4-H or now also FFA, since it   s open to boys and girls  both, to do something like that so you get over a fear of speaking in public. I  had not realized the difference that made until I got to college. In one of my  classes in, probably by junior year, when I was really into all the major  courses, that we had a class that our professor wanted all of us, it was a  small class, but we all had to get up and give a public presentation. There  was one of the guys in our class that we were all up to the point of making  bets of whether or not he was going to pass out from fright when he had to  get up before the room.  I had never seen anybody that terrified to get up before even people that he  knew, though sometimes I find that   s harder than getting up and talking  before folks you don   t know. I thought,    Why am I not afraid of that? All  23  those talks and demonstrations that you were expected to do as part of 4-H.     OSU, I think, had an impact as early as that besides my dad   s livelihood and  where the paycheck was coming from. Was always welcomed, even as a  young kid, you know, when I   d go along with my parents for him to be at  alumni meetings. Looking back, I can tell I was being groomed. I didn   t  know any other school to go to because everybody I   d met was from OSU or  saw how friendly they were, how welcoming, that sort of thing.  Nykolaiszyn Did you have any interactions with Murl Rogers?  Waters Oh yeah  Actually even taught an OLLI class that his daughter was in.  Talking about hitting multigenerational. Murl was a wonderful, wonderful  person. His wife was really sweet, too.  Nykolaiszyn Oh yeah.  Waters If I needed anything and I didn   t know who to go see on campus, I   d go see  Murl at the alumni office. That was when the Alumni Center was still  officed on second floor of the Student Union, just across and down the hall  from the theatre. Went in there all the time, a lot of times just to stop in and  say hi and visit.  Nykolaiszyn Did he put you to work? (Laughter)  Waters No, because I already had part-time jobs other places. He might have  wrangled me into that otherwise. Now, not necessarily alumni related, but I  was an instructor for freshman orientation. Even as an upperclassman, was  then still talking to incoming freshman even as an undergraduate, of,     Here   s kind of the ins and the outs.    That probably even set me up later for  the advisor   s job of, figuring out, especially as an adviser, I worked within  the system, but figured out how sometimes to get around the system. Yeah,  once you were an adviser, you found out that you had at least a little bit of  leeway on substituting and adjusting for students and figuring out what was  best for them. That   s another whole side story. (Laughs)  Nykolaiszyn Do you see an OSU impact in Garvin County today?  Waters To a certain extent. Yeah, Extension Service that   s down here, Garvin  County, you   re just far enough into the state. In fact, when we first moved  down here, I thought,    How did I end up in the heart of OU country?    When  you first move, you   re just like,    Where are the fellow OSU graduates?    We  eventually find each other. I have to say I   m sorry that I haven   t gotten  involved with an alumni group here in the county like I should have.  When we first moved, it seemed that everybody was not an OU graduate but  definitely an OU fan. When you   re cheering on for the orange and black, as  24  it was really referred to when we first moved, you felt like you were kind of  the lone sheep out in the storm sometimes. (Laughs) Through Extension  Service is probably what most people would notice. There are a lot more  visible OSU graduates, I think, in the county now or that people realize, yes,  there is another school to be able to go to. I think the profile of OSU is much  higher now, and the Branding Success  campaign  I think   s one of the best  programs the university   s ever come up with. It   s raised the visibility, but  it   s also brought money into the university for scholarships and that sort of  thing.  Nykolaiszyn It appears that many OSU alums have a loyalty to the university. Any ideas  of what sparks that kind of loyalty?  Waters My first guess would be that OSU always feels like home. I   m sure folks  from other colleges feel the same way. Maybe it   s even what some of the  majors are that people are. Agriculture science majors tied to the land. I  don   t know. It   s a good question.  Nykolaiszyn What is it for you? You   ve been groomed at a very early age to be the  orange and black.  Waters I think part of it is having been familiar with it so long. It wasn   t just,    Oh,  go there for four years, and then you   re gone.    I   ve talked to a few folks that     Oh yeah, I went there for school,    but they never go back. I thought,    Well,  you know, I   ve been there all my life    kind of thing. That may be some of  the difference. When my dad passed away, we set up a scholarship in his  name. Then just a year and a half later when my mom passed away, we  added her name to it. He died in    85. We started the scholarship in    86 and  once a semester ever since. We don   t do summer school. It   s spring. Well, I  say once a semester. Actually it   s just once a year. We do one scholarship a  year. Started out, it was in the zoology department because that   s where the  wildlife major was. Now he had done his degree in ag, but I thought,    Well,  okay, I get to direct this. It   s still going to OSU. We   re going to give it to a  wildlife major.     Then here a few years ago the wildlife major moved over to College of Ag,  and at that point, I have to give him credit for this. Loren Smith, who   s the  department head of what now is integrative biology (no longer zoology  because of the variety of things that their majors do), he was like,    Well,  you know, we   re fine. It makes since for the scholarship to go with where  the major is, but would you want to do anything still in zoology?    He was  smart enough to ask. I said,    Well, yeah, because that was my home  department. You know, the other was my major.    Now not only is there a  scholarship for an undergraduate in wildlife but there is a, it   s called a grant  in aid, I think. It   s basically for a graduate student within the Department of  Zoology. A graduate student now for the last however many years gets a  25  scholarship, too. I think that may be part of it for OSU grads, and I see the  same thing, from information I get from other schools, that they   ll give  money back.  Nykolaiszyn Well, before we close out today, you   ve been in the Wynnewood area for  quite some time.  Waters Yeah.  Nykolaiszyn Could you talk a little bit about changes you   ve seen in this area since  you   ve been here?  Waters Oh wow. Little towns are having a hard time. Businesses that were here  when we first moved have closed. Most of those were either family-owned,  and as family dies off, don   t have kids that are wanting to carry on those  businesses or that sort of thing. You know, little towns statewide, not just in  Garvin County, have to really work at staying alive. When we first moved  down here, it seemed like a lot of the people within Garvin County only  knew Garvin County. When we first moved to Choctaw County, it was the  same thing. You didn   t know anything outside of Choctaw County. Indian  Nation Turnpike and Hugo Lake, I think, made big changes in that because  it brought a lot of other people into the area. We   ve seen ownership for the  refinery change through the years.  Nykolaiszyn Is that the main employer in the area?  Waters Yeah, that, and the state school had been. Of course now state school at  Pauls Valley is officially closed. I heard just within, I guess, this spring, the  end of spring that they   ve officially closed it now. The refinery, though  there   s still a lot of other businesses and lots more oil-related things in the  area now than what there used to be, as far as smaller companies doing  things in the area. It   s not like there   s a wall around Garvin County  anymore. People realize there   s been a lot of people from other parts of the  country have moved into the area so that you   ve maybe got some new ideas  or new experiences that people are bringing in. But still occasionally you   ll  find that, oh, there   s a few folks that it   s like,    No, we want to stay the way  we   ve always been.    Well, that doesn   t necessarily work anymore. You  have to figure out other ways or better ways or different ways to do things to  stay viable. Still lots of friendly folks, people that   ll help you any way that  they can. I think that   s an Oklahoma thing.  Nykolaiszyn Well, we covered quite a bit in a short amount of time. Is there anything else  you   d like to add, something we   ve missed that you   d like to talk about?  Waters Oh gosh, not that   s coming to mind. I know as soon as you walk out the  door I   ll think of a half a dozen things probably, or if you think of extra  26  things, either. I know this is oral interview, but any supplemental  information that you   d need. Yeah, as you can tell, OSU, near and dear. Dad  went to school there. Actually family tradition on my husband   s side of the  family goes back even further. His grandmother and his grandfather both  went to school, so it takes it back even an additional generation.  A fun side story on my dad, I found out from one of my cousins just a few  years ago his dad had left home in Arkansas and became a minister and  moved around a lot. My dad went away to Oklahoma to school, then stayed  in Oklahoma to work. Found out from my cousin that his dad and my dad  were kind of considered the black sheep of the family, I think, by our  grandparents. It only makes sense. You think, well, yeah, probably their  parents were upset that they had left, but neither one of them was the oldest  son. The oldest son was going to be taking over the farming and agricultural  aspect so they had to find something else to do.  I always thought that that was kind of fun to find out that, oh, because they  had left, you know. I don   t think that their sisters ever considered them the  black sheep. Definitely went far afield from being in southwest Arkansas.  Nykolaiszyn Absolutely.  Waters Yeah, through the years, even before I ever attended OSU with my dad   s  involvement with the Alumni Association and alumni banquets or getting  senior students to come to banquets to recruit them. Anytime that we went to  home football games, even junior high and high school, we   d always have  somebody else with us because he   d offer to take somebody.    Come and go  to a game with us. We   ll show you around campus,    that sort of thing.  One of the girls that was in the 4-H horse club at Hugo after I graduated  from college, her dad had been in 4-H in Osage County with my dad. We  always thought that that was kind of fun, that we had two generations with a  4-H and OSU connection along those lines. Just little side stories.  Nykolaiszyn Good memories. Good history. Strong connection. We love it. Luann, thank  you so much for spending time with us this morning.  Waters Thank you.  Nykolaiszyn We appreciate it.  Waters You   re welcome.  -------  -------  .
