Speaker 1: [My name is Larry Crowe.]  I'm interviewer for The HistoryMakers.  Our videographer is Scott Stearns.  Sir, could you please state your name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: My name is Charles F. McAfee.  The F stands for Francis, but most of my friends think it stands for friendly 'cause that's what I am.  It's M-C-A-F-E-E.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Can you give us your date of birth?
Speaker 2: I was born December 25, 1932.
Speaker 1: And place of birth?
Speaker 2: I was born in Los Angeles, California--about the only one in my family for a bunch of generations.  I wasn't born in Kansas.  My mother and father had gone to Los Angeles in the middle of the Depression looking for work.  And I was born, and they decided six months after I was born to come back to Kansas, and this is where I grew up.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is your occupation?
Speaker 2: I'm an architect.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is today's date?
Speaker 2: Today's date is August the 27th in Wichita, Kansas.
Speaker 1: Two thousand and--
Speaker 2: 2002.
Speaker 1: And where are we at the present time?
Speaker 2: You're located in my office in Wichita.
Story_ID: 69052
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, before we get into depth, there are five "People Magazine"-ish type questions I am compelled to ask you.
Speaker 2: All right, okay.
Speaker 1: The first one is what is your favorite food?
Speaker 2: My favorite food is barbeque.
Speaker 1: Any particular kind?
Speaker 2: Whether it's beef, chicken, or the proverbial pork, but that is my favorite food.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: My favorite color is green.  The color of money.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do, do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Favorite time of the year, no, 'cause every time of year is beautiful to me.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: No.  I travel so much, my favorite vacation destination is when I come home.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And do, do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Do I have a favorite phrase or saying?  Not that I know of--I can't think of one offhand.  There may be something that I use a great deal and maybe during this conversation, we'll come back to that.
Story_ID: 69053
Speaker 1: Okay.  Let's talk about your background.  Can you give us the names of your parents and spell those for us, please, along with their birthdates?
Speaker 2: Okay.  My mother and father, my father's name is Arthur J. McAfee, Sr.  He was born in Wichita [Kansas], December, 1904.  My mother's name is Willie Anna Brown McAfee--was born in Waxahachie, Texas.  The date was January the 17th, 1910.
Speaker 1: Can you spell Waxahachie?
Speaker 2: No, I can't spell Waxahachie, Texas (laughter).  It's just south of Fort Worth [Texas].  I've been there.  We took, took pictures out in front when my youngest daughter was graduating from the University of Texas.  We stopped at the roadside sign that says Waxahachie, took a picture there, and brought it back to momma so she could see it (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.  Can you get--well, did your parents tell you about they met?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  My, my mother moved to Wichita with her father who had been a very industrious man.  He managed and owned a hotel in Oklahoma, and then they came on to Wichita and he lived here in Wichita.  And my father grew up here in Wichita.  He was the youngest of seven children.  And education was very, very important to him.  He had to stop school in high school because his mother became very ill, and he went to work to take care of her.  And he was the youngest of all the children and he was still here, and so he did that.  And that was when my mother and father met and they were married, you know, sometime after that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 69054
Speaker 1: Now, did, did your mother [Willie Anna McAfee] and father [Arthur McAfee, Sr.] have--not, or did you had--do, do you know very much about your ancestors so, on either side, you know, where they came from, what they were doing during slavery or reconstruction or--
Speaker 2: On my, on my grandfather's side, on my mother's side, my grandfather [Charles Francis Brown], I told you about him.  Well, his family all basically came out of Memphis [Tennessee].  And his aunt and mother all went to what was then called LeMoyne Institute [Memphis, Tennessee] right out of slavery.  And he used to tell me about how he swam the Mississippi River.  And I remember the time I drove across it.  I didn't even like driving across it the first time, let alone trying to think about swimming it.  But they came from--
Speaker 1: He came all the way across it?
Speaker 2: Yes.  They came from Memphis and migrated, you know, this direction.  On my father's side, my father's grandfather, my great-grandfather [Jacob McAfee] was actually from Ohio, and joined the Union Army in Ohio.  He and my great-great-grandmother, my great-grand-, my great-great-grandmother died in--I mean, I mean, were married in, in, oh, had to be 1860.  And he joined the colored troops in, in, Ohio, and went and ended up fighting in a number of battles.  And he was wounded in the Battle of Petersburg.  He got out of the--honorable, with an honorable discharge, which I have hanging on my wall at my house, in a military hospital in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  He went back to Ohio, picked up his wife and the children then, and came to Kansas in a covered wagon.  Every time I drive from Kansas City [Kanas] to Wichita and drive through the beautiful, beautiful Flint Hills, I gotta think how hard that man wanted to get anywhere.  And people say to me and say, well, why did he end up stopping in Wichita?  I said the only thing I can figure out was the wheel broke at the connection of the Little Arkansas and the Big Arkansas river.  The wheel broke and they didn't have anybody to fix the wheel.  He said, well, this is where we're going to stay.  That's the only reason I can figure out why he stayed here.  But Jacob McAfee was a serious pioneer.  He went before the State Legislature at the turn of the century to try to keep them from segregating what they called the first class schools or the first class cities in the state of Kansas.  The state, in its ultimate wisdom, was stupid enough not to listen to him, and they went ahead and segregated the schools.  And it took fifty-four years later before Thurgood Marshall got it turned around and embarrassed Kansas as it should have been.  But he was--owned an awful lot of property.  There's a back fee edition to the city of Wichita.  He owned a bridge across the, the Chisholm Creek that he used to charge people for to travel back and forth to cross this bridge; owned a lot of cattle; owned a lot of land.
Story_ID: 69055
Speaker 1: I have a letter from my grandfather to my great-grandfather [Jacob McAfee] basically saying, papa, I have been ill, but I'm fine and I have 50 acres ready to plant.  And so, you need to send me $15 by Mr. Clark when he comes out.  And I have two hogs that I'm going to purchase and that's going to cost another $20, and so send $35 out by Mr. Clark.  And, papa, I will come in to see you, but it's an all-day trip.  And all day was 15 miles out of town just past the airport that you flew in (laughter), but it had to be an all-day trip because there were no railroads as such.  It was all by horseback or by wagon.  That was my grandfather.  My grandfather fought in the Spanish-American War.  I have letters where he wrote from San Luis Obispo, Cuba.  I have letters that he wrote to his wife.  And he came back home--
Speaker 2: Now, excuse me now, what unit?  Was, was he in the 25th or the 26th--
Speaker 1: He was in the Kansas Colored Volunteers--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --and was neither of those.  He was with Teddy Roosevelt [President Theodore Roosevelt]--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and all that much, you know.  It may have had a different number then but when he went in, it was as the Kansas Colored Volunteers.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yep.  And he came back.  And the woman that he married, her name was Anna Ritchie (ph.).  Anna Ritchie was the first African American to go to public schools in the state and city of Wichita.  And education was very, very important to her.  And so, therefore, my, my father [Arthur McAfee, Sr.] and the story that I told you about, so when Anna Ritchie McAfee got sick, my father basically, you know, took care of her.  And I remember her when I was very, very young.  We lived at 1020 Ohio.  The house doesn't, doesn't exist anymore.  And it was in the neighborhood basically that was like the second or third sort of heavily populated black community, in, in Wichita [Kansas]. Wichita was not as segregated then as it is now.  And she and, and my grandfather had seven children that survived, aunts and uncles, aunt Mary and Bernice and Helen, my uncle James, and, and, and Jacob.  Jacob was the name of my great-grandfather, so Jacob came down through three generations in the McAfee family.
Story_ID: 69056
Speaker 1: My father [Arthur McAfee, Sr.] and my mother [Willie Anna McAfee] were married and there are three of us.  I have an older, very dear sister [Gwen McAfee] who was my inspiration and, and she was the brilliant one in the family.  She went all the way through school--nothing but straight As all the time.  So my brother and I just (laughter) absolutely caught it, but while Gwen did so much better than you did, you know (laughter).  And, but she graduated from Wichita University [now Wichita State University, Wichita, Kansas].  That's what it was called at that time before Wichita State.  She graduated and went to California and worked at Children's Hospital, and then worked for thirty years before she retired.  And she retired as the head of the hematology lab at UCLA Medical School [University of California, Los Angeles School of Medicine, Los Angeles, California] with 70 or 80 employees.  And, and when she retired, she came back home, and I was so happy and grateful that she did.  My brother, Arthur, Jr., is the athletic director, now retired, and basketball coach at Morehouse College [Atlanta, Georgia] at which, of course, is the college that Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] and a lot of other very, very famous African American people.  My brother won over 600 basketball games and he was on the NCA[A?] Board of Directors.  And for a number of years and, and, but had to go South because he couldn't get a job in this part of the country as a basketball coach, although he graduated from Wichita State [University, Wichita, Kansas] and has two degrees from Kansas State [University, Manhattan, Kansas] (unclear).  But he couldn't get a job coaching basketball here, so ended up going South.  And he coached at what's now called Mississippi Valley [State University, Itta Bena, Mississippi], but he coached at Lane [College] in Jackson, Tennessee.  He coached at Bishop College in [East] Texas.  He coached at Lincoln [University] in, in [Jefferson City] Missouri, and finally at Morehouse.
Speaker 2: He primarily, he primarily coached basketball?
Speaker 1: He coached basketball--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --yep, yep.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: It sort of stayed in the blood because his, his son, Arthur McAfee III, is the legal counsel for the National Football League Players Association [NFLPA].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: So of, of the three of you, you're the youngest or--
Speaker 1: I'm the youngest of the three.
Story_ID: 69057
Speaker 1: In my case, I was always a very, very inquisitive young man.  I mean, I, I didn't like too many people messing with me--ever.  And I didn't like anybody to challenge me.  I got in enough fights in school.  I remember one morning--we lived right across the street from the school.  I guess I was probably in the third grade, something like that.  And my father [Arthur McAfee, Sr.] didn't go to work till 10:00.  And so I came walking in the house.  They were having breakfast.  They looked at me, said what are you doing home?  I said, I quit school.  My father looked at me.  My mother [Willie Anna McAfee] said it, you quit school?  I said yes.  Why did you quit school?  Well, I got in this fight and Mr. Anderson (ph.), who grew up with my father, said McAfee, come to the office, you know, you're going to be punished.  Now, daddy, I didn't do anything wrong.  A guy picked on me first and I hit him.  But he happened to be up on the slides and when I hit him, I knocked him off on the ground.  I said so it wasn't my fault.  My father, very calm man--always--but I think we have to go back to school.  That's why, daddy, I, I, I really don't want to go back.  Well, I think that we need to go talk to Mr. Anderson and we'll talk this out.  I said, okay, if Mann (ph.) can go with me.  Well, Mann was my German Shepherd, and we walked across the school ground.  And Mann had a serious reputation.  Everybody parted the ways (laughter).  And we walked on into the school.  And this was one of these old two-story schools, and the office was at the mezzanine before you went up to the second floor.  And Mr. Anderson was standing at the mezzanine level, very sternly looking at me and told me to come on upstairs to the office.  And so the three of us we went up the steps, my father, Mann, and me.  And Mann sat down by the desk.  And Mr. Anderson was explaining about the fight and what the rules are, and how I had to be reprimanded.  And he reached over to put his hand on this razor strap.  When he started to put his hand on this razor strap, my dog, Mann said, aarrr.  Mr. Anderson very intelligently took his hand off the razor strap (laughter).  And I never did get a spanking--I want you to know that.  Those are some of the kind of things that I constantly stayed in.  When I went to--we got recruited out of the neighborhood.  They put a Catholic school two doors--two, two blocks up the street from my house.  They didn't have enough students, male students, to have a basketball team, so they recruited us from the neighborhood.  I mean, if you did that nowadays, that'd be illegal recruiting.  And they'd probably, you know, take the scholarships away, but whatever, they recruited a bunch of us from the neighborhood.
Story_ID: 69058
Speaker 1: Let me just ask a question just about the neighborhood before we go a little further.  Can, can you kinda reflect back and tell us about some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up in that neighborhood?  And what was the name of that neighborhood?  Was there a name (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Well, it was around Dunbar Elementary School.  And one block south was St. Matthew C.M.E. Church.  One block west was New Hope Baptist Church.  Those were the two religious institutions that were close.  And practically everybody within the blocks around belonged to one of those two churches.  All the way on the other side of town was St. Pauli (unclear) and Calvary Baptist Church.  And some people belonged to it, but most people belonged to those two churches.  There's a Rev. [E.T.] Fishback, who was the pastor of New Hope Baptist Church, when I was a very little boy.  I have an original copy of a, of a story that he wrote called "The Negro Washerwoman".  It's really interesting.  It was actually published--the whole bit, but--
Speaker 1: Rev. Fishback?
Speaker 2: Rev. Fishback, yes.  And so, the--everybody sort of grew up in those two churches.  There were a lot of families that were around.  The Stone family lived kind of around the corner and up two blocks.  They had eleven children.  The Ulle (ph.) family lived one block up from us.  They had eleven children.  The first African American to be on the fire department lived at the end of the block from us.  Probably some of the most popular people in the neighborhood were the guys who ran on the road, who were the dining car cooks and waiters, 'cause they always seemed to dress so nice.  And they had, you know, great, great clothes and always seem to have a lot of money.  Across the school ground, one of those guys opened a thing called the Trolley Inn.  And the Trolley Inn was an old streetcar that one of these guys started cooking hamburgers and hot dogs.  And I'll tell you, I still haven't had a hot dog as good as those tasted in those days.  There was another guy who cooked named Washington.  He was a good friend of my dad's [Arthur McAfee, Sr.], and sometimes he would come over and cook for us.  The man could really, really cook.  And so, we had a lot of these people around the neighborhood, but in the next block south of me, half that block was white.  Those kids we played with but then when school started, they didn't go to Dunbar.  And we didn't understand that.  They went to another school.  Essentially, they bused them out.  Well, Wichita, when they segregated the schools, they created a school on the west side, which was called Douglas (ph.); a school on the east side, which used to be called Ingalls, which was now named Dunbar; and L'Ouverture.  And there was an 18th Street School which eventually closed.  But, and then there was another one further down south until they opened Dunbar as an all segregated school.  But, so we basically grew up in a very segregated, sort of educational world.
Story_ID: 69059
Speaker 1: But I was very fortunate because the teachers that I had were the best.  They were people who should have been teaching in high school and college, but couldn't get jobs there, so they were all teaching in elementary--outstanding people.  And so, if you talked to any of who had gone through the school system, we all worshipped those people.
Speaker 2: Who were they?  I mean, what are their names?  Can you remember some?
Speaker 1: All of them.  Miss Flake (ph.) was my, my kindergarten teacher and she was practically everybody's kindergarten teacher.  Here in town, Miss Ingram (ph.) is still alive, still drives her own car--just saw her yesterday--taught me math.  Little bitty lady named Katherine Jeeter (ph.) taught music.  And if you walked up to her and looked down on her, she'd look at you and say, don't look down on me.  Well, how would you not look down on her, you know, you'd have to get almost on your knees not to look down at her.  But John Carter was probably the biggest influence in my life.  Carter taught me how to, how to do mechanical drawing in the seventh grade.  And I got very good at it in the seventh grade and the eighth grade.  John Carter eventually became the principal of L'Ouverture [Elementary School, now L'Ouverture Computer Technology Magnet Elementary School, Wichita, Kansas].  In a number of years, my wife [Gloria McAfee] became the same principal of L'Ouverture, but my wife also went to L'Ouverture.
Speaker 2: Now L'-, L'Ouverture is a high school?
Speaker 1: It's a grade school--
Speaker 2: A grade school, okay.
Speaker 1: --but it was a grade school that went to the seventh grade, seventh and eighth grade.  Dunbar went to the sixth grade.  Douglass went to the sixth grade.  And L'Ouverture went to the eighth grade--through, through the eighth grade.
Story_ID: 69060
Speaker 1: The first time we ever integrated in Wichita [Kansas] was in the ninth grade, and you could to either Horace Mann or Central.  You're going to interview the Jacksons [Anderson Jackson, HM, and Abner Jean "Val" Jackson, HM], and they went to Douglass and then went to L'Ouverture.  And, and then they went on to, to [Wichita] North High [School, Wichita, Kansas].  They went to Central and then went to North.  I went to Central and went to East [High School, Wichita, Kansas].  And that was the, the direction everybody went in those days.  Well, I started playing tennis at a very young age.  One of my other teachers taught me how to play tennis.  I played baseball, played tennis, played basketball.  And I got pretty good at it and I made All-State, playing for this(laughter) Catholic school.  And when I went to the ninth grade, since I was only there one year and not three, they wouldn't let me come out.  And the guy never checked my credentials or anything, so I kept playing for the Catholic school.  I made All-State.  And the coach came and said, this guy, McAfee, is he some kin to you?  I said, I'm the one.  He said what?  Well, you're going to play for us next year.  I said, I'll be gone next year.  I said, I've already gone to summer school.  I'll be at East High.  Well, I went to East High.  I scored 19 points the night I went out for basketball on the final cut.  And they cut me 'cause they only had one African American on the south board team, one on the junior team, and one on the senior team.  And they never won anything.  My last year, I go to the University of Nebraska [Lincoln, Nebraska].  I get out of East High.  I go to the University of Nebraska.  The reason I'm there is because my mother [Willie Anna McAfee] and father [Arthur McAfee, Sr.] sent me up North because they didn't think I could handle the still segregation that was so much here in the state of Kansas--both at Kansas and the University of Kansas and Kansas State.  And I wanted to be an architect and Wichita State [University, Wichita, Kansas], Wichita University at that time, didn't teach it, so I went to University of Nebraska.
Story_ID: 69061
Speaker 1: Did people kinda consider Kansas the South here--do black people consider it the South?
Speaker 2: We sort of considered it up South.
Speaker 1: Yeah, 'cause there's, there's, you know, it's got a history of their, of struggle over back in the 1800s, abolitionists ver-, versus the slave holdings and John Brown and all that--
Speaker 2: Well, but see John Brown Farm was like 100 miles north of here.  And Kansas came in as a free state.  Missouri came in and it was a slave state.  But there's a hotel in Lawrence, Kansas that has a plaque out in front of it.  And it talks about how this hotel was burned by [William] Quantrill and his raiders because they used to raid across the borders, you know, and kill each other back and forth 'cause, you know, they didn't like their position on slavery and some other things, you know.  But so there were a lot of people, even now, you know, you have a lot of people who still have those same attitudes.  I think if, if a lot of people could, they could vote on repeal of the 14th, 15th, 16th Amendment, they'd do it.  But the whole issue is, is that there was still enough that didn't happen.  We couldn't eat in the restaurants, not at Dockum [Drug Store] and, and those other places, or Kress', we couldn't eat there.  And, and it was a young man by the name of Ronnie Walters [Ron Walters], and the other group of NAACP Student Chapter at which the university that first went and sat in the Dockum Drug Store.  That basically was the first demonstration.  It wasn't in the South.  It was here in Wichita, Kansas.  And that guy is now Dr. Ronald Walters from Howard University [Washington, D.C.] and University of Maryland [College Park, Maryland].
Story_ID: 69062
Speaker 1: So there was a lot of stuff going on in Wichita [Kansas], you know, in the process.  Well, while that was happening, I was at the University of Nebraska [Lincoln, Nebraska].  And I'd been asked to come out to play basketball by the basketball coach.  And not knowing that, that conference had no blacks playing in it either.  And when I made the team, I found out that there were none and, and I went and asked the coach.  And he said, yeah, they're having meetings on you.  What are you talking about?  And then, 'cause one of my classmates, the one who did make the East Side [High School] team, he went to the University of Kansas [Lawrence, Kansas].  And I was at Nebraska and he made KU's team, and I made Nebraska's team, and they were voting to see whether either one of us could play.  Well, they finally let us to play, but the two schools who voted not to let us play, originally, the University of Missouri [Columbia, Missouri] and the University of Oklahoma [Norman, Oklahoma].  And now you look at the University of Missouri and the University of Oklahoma now, you would never believe that was the case, but it was the case.  Well, they let me on the varsity.  We played one game at home, and then made a trip.  They left me at home because I couldn't play in the arenas--played University of Tennessee [Knoxville, Tennessee], University of Arkansas [Fayetteville, Arkansas], University of Texas [Austin, Texas].  I couldn't stay in any of the hotels and couldn't play in any of the arenas, so they left me at home.
Speaker 2: Now, now this is in the--
Speaker 1: It's the University of Nebraska.
Speaker 2: It's like what, what year we're talking about?
Speaker 1: This is in 1951.
Speaker 2: '51 [1951].
Speaker 1: Okay.  And so (laughter), so, you know, I obviously felt pretty bad about that whole thing.  There are only five black students on the whole campus at the University of Nebraska.
Story_ID: 69063
Speaker 1: Now how did you, how did you come to--well, you said that you were sent there because of--
Speaker 2: I wanted to take architecture.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.
Speaker 2: And the only two schools basically that were even reasonably close to Wichita [Kansas] that I could get in that I knew about were University of Nebraska [Lincoln, Nebraska] and the University of Illinois [Urbana-Champaign, Illinois].  But Illinois was a little too far and I didn't want to go that far.  And I went to the University of Nebraska.  I didn't know anybody there or anything--nothing.  My brother [Arthur McAfee, Jr.] took me up there and dropped me off and left me.  And I felt like blood absolutely (laughter)--this all about family.  And, but it was a--it was a heck of an experience because number one, I learned what I really needed to do to work at what I needed to do.  And, and, and, my brother who had just graduated from Wichita State [University, Wichita, Kansas] and went into the military, and my brother is my best friend.  And he's my big brother but he is just always steady like a rock.  Anyway, my brother wrote me a letter and told me that he didn't see anybody who was in--became a lieutenant in the ROTC that anybody had respect for them.  And so, I went in to tell them I didn't want to go into advanced ROTC.
Story_ID: 72064
Speaker 1: And the, the guy was bragging about the guy who started the Ku Klux Klan.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: The guy was bragging about how--
Speaker 2: They can do--
Speaker 1: --how, yeah, how, how red the river ran, you know, yeah, right, you know.  But, no, you know, those are the kind of things, you know, like I said.  When, when, when my mother [Willie Anna McAfee] and father [Arthur McAfee, Sr.] decided that I needed to go to Nebraska, it was all part of that.  I mean it was, it was all part of that.  It was, it was the fact that, that there were--my sister [Gwen McAfee] by now had already graduated, then had to go to California to get a decent job.  My brother [Arthur McAfee, Jr.] was never going to get a coaching job in Wichita [Kansas], so had to leave, you know.  My father was so angry, you know, about all of that.  And, and I wanted to be an architect and that was it, and that's what I wanted to be.  So, you know, they had to get me out of, out of this environment to what they considered was a better environment, or at least we hoped it was.
Story_ID: 72065
Speaker 1: And I didn't run into, into the kind of overt racism, you know, and, and, and that sort of thing until I made the freshman team.  And, you know, some days, you know, you can close your eyes and throw the ball up, it goes in the basket.  We can only play against each other back in those days prior to the varsity games except one time, and one time they would let you play against a small college or somebody.  So we played against a small college that had a small college all-American.  I came out there and I think I probably hit the first five or six shots I took.  And about 7 or 8,000 people in the stands, and this guy yells across the floor and he says, "Switch men, I got the nigger."  And I stopped dead in my tracks, and I looked over at the referee.  He just looked at me.  I looked over the guys on, on my bench with my, my teammates, and they were just looking at me.  The coach did this--started rubbing the top of his head.  Dang, so I kept playing.  This guy dribbled up to me, turned, stuck an elbow in my stomach, and ran in and shot a layup.  I'm looking at the ref, like what is this?  The referee says, "Play ball."  Okay.  So he came down the next time, he thought it worked real good that time, and he swung at me with his elbow, but I sidestepped it.  And he broke for the basket and I ran right in his tracks.  He got ready to go up for the shot and I was all over the top of him.  I had the ball in my hand.  When I got through, the ball and him were on the floor.  Coach snatched me out of the game and was reprimanding me.  And I looked at him and I said, "My name ain't Jackie Robinson, and I ain't gonna take that crap off of nobody."  Now he didn't really understand the totality of what I was telling him.
Story_ID: 72066
Speaker 1: But my father [Arthur McAfee, Sr.] took my brother [Arthur McAfee, Jr.] and I to see Jackie Robinson in St. Louis [Missouri] that first year.  And--
Speaker 2: Is that '48 [1948]?
Speaker 1: Uh-hum.  And '48 [1948], '48 [1948], '47 [1947], whatever.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And so we went to St. Louis and we got there at midnight in this hotel.  It was a black hotel.  And I'd never been that far east and I'd never been to a town where coal was the power.  I remember early the next morning I got up and I went outside and everything was covered, covered with just coal dust.  I didn't like that.  And I walked back inside.  And at end of the lobby there were two doors open and it was the restaurant and the bar, whatever.  And there was somebody walking back and forth in there.  And I walked and I looked, and it was Jackie Robinson.  And I looked at him, I went inside and I said, hi, Mr. Robinson.  I introduced myself and I put my hand out.  He shook my hand and I think it was the biggest hand that I ever shook.  I ran upstairs and got my brother and my father and said, Jackie Robinson's downstairs.  He said no, he's not.  Yes, he is, too.  We came downstairs and he was there.  And so we were talking to him.  And I remembered I asked him, I said, where are the rest of the players?  He looked real funny and he said, they're at another hotel, and I didn't understand that.  Well, we went to the game.  My father--well, Jackie had said he probably wouldn't play because he had hurt his knee and he wasn't certain he would play.  And so we went to the game.  Well, our last name is McAfee and my father wrote for the tickets.  And they sold us these tickets and we were right down on the first base line, probably four or five seats up from the rail.  And everybody was looking at us really funny.  I didn't understand that either at the time until all of a sudden, I looked over and out in the right field stands, it was even,  I think it wasn't, wasn't even attached to the regular stands.  The right field stands were all black people.  And that was where, the only place where black people could sit in Sportsman's Park.  And Jackie didn't start the game, but Jackie came on and they threw a ball and almost knocked him down.  He got up and pitched it through the next pitch and he hit it.  And it went almost all the way to the wall.  And Jackie ran around and got to second base.  Well, the right field stands could have caused an earthquake.  I mean, you know, it was a celebration, you know.  And I remembered what I felt about that, you know.  And I came back.  I was playing junior leagues in baseball and, and I had this tremendous desire to be really, really good.  And it just transcends into everything.  Whatever it is I do, I take on that same drive.  I always have and it just keeps going.  And, and I remember, you know, almost all black people became Brooklyn Dodger fans, you know, like we were all Joe Louis fans.  And, and we still have people that don't understand that.  You know, I'm going like, where'd you live, you know.  But so all of this stuff, you know, kept building in me and building in me.

Speaker 1: And so, when I, when I got all the way up, you know, and get ready to graduate, and I went to the University of Nebraska [Lincoln, Nebraska].  I thought, well, I promised my mother [Willie Anna McAfee] and father [Arthur McAfee, Sr.], I won't play sports.  I won't do any of that.  And I got asked to come out by the basketball coach who saw me playing.  And I thought, well, it'll be okay, and I can get a scholarship and save them some money.  And my father who read everything--I came home for Christmas break, and dad was sitting in his chair.  And he said, I read this article in the "Sports Illustrated".  It said, Nebraska- Kansas outstanding young freshman guard named Charles McAfee (laughter).  I looked at him.  I said, daddy, now, daddy, let me explain this to you.  He said, you can't explain nothing to me (laughter).  He said, we told you--I work, you study.  I said, I know, daddy, but I said, I really thought I could help you and momma, said, now if you tell momma.  He said, I'm not telling your mother anything.  You tell her.  I went in the kitchen.  Mother was in the kitchen.  She's doing something at the sink.  I start trying to tell her.  I told her--she just turned and looked at me once and turned back around, and never said a word (laughter).  I wish she had taken a hex or beat me, 'cause the look just almost killed me, you know.  And, and, so I sit there, you know, and I said to myself, I said, you know, these people know me so well.  And, and, and they knew exactly how to punish me without doing anything, you know.  And so, they finally talked to each other and they finally, you know, agreed to let me play, yeah.  And I end up getting drafted (laughter), you know, going to Europe.
Story_ID: 72068
Speaker 1: I was stationed in Louisiana, a whole another racist attitude and everything at that time which just drove me nuts.  I went to Europe, stationed in, in, southern part of Germany.  And then they moved us to the northern part of Germany.  And we were stationed right across the street in downtown Frankfurt from Alabama National Guard.  Had two race riots while I was there (laughter).  I mean, it was just ridiculous, you know.  And I came back home at that point.  And it was really at that point where I said, I'm going to be an architect.  That's what I'm going to do and I'm going to make a difference in what I do.  I went back to school.  I studied hard, I studied hard.  I was at the top of my class.  And I went to this next class and I went from almost the top of my class to almost the bottom of my class in one semester.  This guy said to me, he said, I want you to understand why I'm being so tough on you.  I said yeah.  He said, you see those fellows in there? Talking about my, my classmates.  I said yeah.  He said, you're going to have to be twice as good as they are.  I said, oh, really?  I said, then does that mean I'm going to have to be twice as good as [Ludwig] Mies van der Rohe and Frank Lloyd Wright and Le Corbusier?  I said, how long have you been in this country?  He said, two years.  Why?  I said, I've been here for over 20; my father [Arthur McAfee, Sr.], for over 30; my grandfather, for 25 more.  I said, and on and on and on.  I said, the last thing I need you to tell me about is my social problems.  All I need you to do is teach me about architecture--nothing more and nothing less.  And I will not be in your class next semester.  What?  I said, I took a course at Kansas State [University, Manhattan, Kansas] in the summer, and I am substituting that course for your class.  I'm out of here.  So I go back to now my fourth year.  I go right back to the top of the class.
Story_ID: 72069
Speaker 1: In my fifth year, Gloria [McAfee] and I had gotten married.  Into my fifth year, I have a, an instructor from Denmark.  And we had this project to design a hospital in Minneapolis [Minnesota].  And we're supposed to come in with a drawing, an outline, and what this is going to look like.  And all I came in with were four lines on a paper like this.  And he came by and he looked at mine, and he had his hand in his pocket and he says, I am not even going to discuss this and walked by.  And then he turned around, he said, yes, I am.  What is the meaning of this?  And I said, I'm sick and tired of designing restaurants in Persia, museums in Africa.  I said, I want to design a project where I can go out and touch the site.  He looked at me.  He says, yes, class dismissed.  Next day, we had a site right there in Lincoln, Nebraska.  So all my classmates used to say, hey, Charlie, you been out touching the site today (laughter)?  So, you know, everything was going well.  I did seventeen sheets of drawings for first semester.  Some guys only did two or three.  They were all fine line ink drawings.  And so, I said to him, I said, yeah, I said, I said, I said, I want to go get an interview for--to get a job.  And he said yes.  I said, I want to make certain I've got enough work done to be able to make the trip to Los Angeles [California].  He said, oh, yes, yes, you have one of the few projects I'm going to accept.  And so, at that point, he said, I will write you letters of recommendation.  And I said, ode on me, I said, oh, that's not necessary.  I said, I already have interviews with Paul Williams who was the black architect in the world at that time; Richard Neutra; and, and Welton Becket, the three most famous firms on the West Coast.  And so, I said, I said, we will--I don't need you to do that.  And so, he said, well, fine.  So I go and I have these marvelous interviews and marvelous job offers.  And I ended up coming back to school.  And I was going up the stairs, and one of my classmates said, c'mon, let's go have a cup of coffee.  And I said, no, no, I want to see the grades.  Oh, oh, no, they didn't even post them.  Let's, let's go have some coffee.  I need to talk to you anyway.  I couldn't figure what the hell he was doing.  I said, no, no, I know they must have posted the grades somewhere, so I went on up the steps.  I get up there and, sure enough, there they are.  I come down to my name and read a line across it and it said, McAfee, incomplete.  Incomplete?  How the hell did I get an incomplete?  And I'm looking at some of the grades the other guys got that only handed in two or three sheets.  So nobody's up there.  So I start to walk back by and I look in the dean's office.  And there are my drawings on the dean's desk--big, yellow marks all over them.  So I went in and I read the comments sitting on the dean's desk.  So I came back and found the dean.  The dean said, McAfee, what seems to be your problem?  I said, my problem, I said, I don't understand what the hell you're talking about.  He says--threw this sheet of paper across the street--across the desk--and we'll sign to, these are the people who are unhappy with the way architecture is taught at the University of Nebraska.  My name is second from the top of the list.  I didn't even know this guy.  He came in from the East Coast someplace--I think Harvard.  He taught a freshman design class, flunked everybody in his class, and left.  I never had a conversation with this guy.  The dean followed it up with a statement, "If you don't like the way architecture is taught here, why don't you learn how to speak Spanish, and go to Puerto Rico?"  It made me so angry I didn't know what to do.  I looked at him.  I started to go across the desk after him 'cause I mean, I have never been non-violent, so I mean I, you know, this, this didn't make sense to me.  So, I looked at him, you know, and I said, I want to tell you something.  I said, I got one more semester at this place, and I will graduate if I have to stand on my head in the process.  Do you understand me?  I turned around and walked out.  I ended the semester and got the top grade in the class.  You know, I left the University of Nebraska, and I said I will never come back here.
Story_ID: 72070
Speaker 1: I came home.  I was on my way to LA [Los Angeles, California] or New York [New York] to take a job.  There was a black guy named John Henderson who had graduated from Kansas State [University, Manhattan, Kansas] out of World War II.  And John said, I heard you were here and I wanted to come by and talk to you.  He said, where are you going to go to work?  And I said, I don't know.  I haven't made up my mind yet.  He said, well, I hope you have a job some place 'cause I, I was never able to get a job in Kansas.  And I know you won't be able to--I didn't like anybody to tell me what I couldn't do either.  So Monday morning, I went out looking for a job, and I found a job just like that.  It was funny.  This guy says, you know, you really have good stuff.  He said, well, we only make a decision--both partners said, I'm getting ready to go on vacation, and he'll be back from vacation.  But I'm going to leave a note saying, if he approves and, and we'd like--I'm recommending that we hire you.  So I thought, well, I got a job so I don't need to go back.  Well, I went back that Wednesday just--I didn't even care,  I just went back. So the guy said, yeah, he says your, your work is really good.  He said, but I was kind of worried about my partner.  I said, why were you worried about your partner?  We often wonder what would happen if a colored fellow came in looking for a job.  I said, oh, really?  And he said, and I was kind of worried about, you know, what my partner would ever feel like that.  So why is that?  He said, well, my partner is from Oklahoma.  I said, oh, but where are you from?  I'm from Texas. Like they were both from places I couldn't play.  Okay.  So I'm going like, what is this supposed to mean to me?  Well, I went to work for them.  They ran out of work.  I went--that afternoon, I had another job.  I worked for another firm for almost two years.  And then I went to work for a third firm.  They wouldn't even let me talk to the client.  I couldn't go out on a job site.  And I just went over one day and quit.  I came home.  I told my wife [Gloria McAfee], I said, let's start packing.  We're leaving.  She said, okay, where are we going?  I said, I don't know.  So I spent the weekend just walking around the block, and thinking, you know, what am I going to do?   Well, on Monday, I'll call.  So, on Monday, I called Paul Williams, and told him I'd like to come work for him.  He said, I offered you a job while you were still in school.  I said, I didn't think I was good enough to work for you.  He said, you didn't give me any credit, did you?  (Laughter).  I said, no, I said, it wasn't that.  I just didn't think I was good enough.  So, he said, the job is yours when you want it.  I said okay.  So then I called a firm in Boston [Massachusetts].  And the firm in Boston said, the guy I had done my thesis with worked for them.  And he said, we've seen your work, and we'd like for you to come work for us in Boston, or you can work for us in Rome [Italy] or in Ankara, Turkey.  I said, I'll call you back.  So I went and talked to my dad [Arthur McAfee, Sr.].  I said, daddy, I said, I told him what happened.  He said, why are you unhappy?  I said what?  He said, well, you're not happy about it.  I said, daddy, I'd like to start my own business.  I had the two-week paycheck that I got when I left the firm where it was.  And my wife was teaching school.  And I said, I'd like to start my own office.  He said, let's do it.
Story_ID: 72071
Speaker 1: So we found this place across the street from this, from the courthouse.  It's still there.  And down on the ground floor was an old grocery store.  The food odors were so bad they would just filter up through the place and it just smelled horrible.  I'd go around spraying disinfectant just to keep the food odors down.  I had this one job.  And it was--I'd, I'd been working on it at home and it just started construction.  And in a few months, it won this National Design Award.  The only other job I had was a mortuary.  And you're going to interview the Jacksons and these guys are my friends from this big--and we're still real close.  Anyway, their mortuary is in third generation when they came in.  It's in fifth now, but anyway, so I had this mortuary.  The mortuary saved my business life, okay (laughter).  So, I end up--I got this letter from FHA [Federal Housing Administration], telling me I had won this design award.  My wife and I--Gloria [McAfee] had gone to Howard [University, Washington, D.C.], and I didn't know anything about Washington, D.C.  I'd never been there in my life.  And, but I had no information.  So what they did was they sent me a letter saying I won, but nothing else.  So I called and they were embarrassed.  And they said, we'll send you this, and do you have hotel reservations?  No, we'll make your hotel reservations at the Hilton and da da da.  And so, ode on me.  I flew into Baltimore [Maryland].  I thought that was close enough.  Somebody here sold me a ticket--I flew to Baltimore.  So by the time I get to Washington, it was like midnight.  And early the next morning, I called them and they said, well, our office is just right down the street, so why don't you come down?  So, we went down and I walked through the door--Gloria and I walked in the door.  We were standing there.  And this lady looked up and said, are you, are you Mr. McAfee?  And I kind of looked around, I said, yes.  The woman jumped up and ran out of the room.  I'm looking at my wife--going, what did I do now, you know?  So the woman came out dragging this other lady.  Both of them are white and she says--they looked at me and said, Dr. Weaver will be so proud.  Well, then I knew what it was.  Doctor Weaver was African American.  I am.  I knew what it was.
Speaker 2: And Robert Weaver, he was like Secretary of--
Speaker 1: He's, he became the first black Secretary in the President's Cabinet.  At that time, he was head of what was called HHFA [Housing and Home Finance Agency], and then it became the Department of Housing and Urban Development.
Speaker 2: That's under [President] Lyndon [B.] Johnson, right?
Speaker 1: Right, right, right.
Speaker 2: And so, it was funny because I mean, what happened to me in such a very short period of time.  They said, well, the award winners are taking pictures back in the Director of FHA's office so just go right back here.  And I went back there.  And the door opened and out walked I.M. Pei.  And I'm going, my--
Speaker 1: Can you spell his name for us?  Okay.
Speaker 2: P-E-I, yeah, it goes I.M. Pei, okay.  So, anyway, so Pei who is [William] Zeckendorf's architect, and graduated from Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] and everything, you know.  Father is the President of the Bank of China and all kind of stuff, you know, came with reasonably good credentials.  So, Pei has always worked huge buildings all over every place.  And when he walked out, he looked at me and he said, are you one of the award winners?  And I said yes.  He said, how old are you?  And I said twenty-nine.  He smiled and he said, I remember those days.  And I thought, did he have to borrow the money from his daddy to come get this award (laughter).  So, the ceremony was the next morning.  The Chairman of the Department of Architecture at Howard University [Washington, D.C.], Howard Hamilton Backey (ph.), came.  A couple of our other friends came--one of the black people in (unclear).  Eighteen hundred people in there.  They would say, in this building in Detroit [Michigan], huge high rise apartment complex, by [Ludwig] Mies van der Rohe, you know; this building by Skidmore [Owings] and Merrill; Kips Bay [Towers] by I.M. Pei; and the Eubanks House by Charles McAfee.  Everybody said who?  (Laughter).  And so, that was the beginning.  And I thought talent was going to transcend the racism that was out there.  So I won design award after design award after design award.  And I, and it just kept going.  And, and, and so, it was all about talent.  And I said, that'll do it.
Story_ID: 72072
Speaker 1: Wichita [Kansas] put out an RFP for a new zoo project.  They had nineteen or twenty firms that submitted.  They interviewed five, cut three, and interviewed three.  And I got picked to do the job, but one of the board members said, I like Charles.  And when I have private work to do, I'll have him do my private work, but this is $20 million of the public's money and we can't trust him to help. So I didn't get the job.  About that same time, I had been called to do a project at Wichita U [Wichita State University, Wichita, Kansas].  At that time, it was called Wichita U and Beacon 'cause they had just bought the Beacon.  And so, they called me over to do a project.  I went because I thought it was going to be really something great.  It was to raise the elevator to the third floor (laughter), and to raise the fire stairs to the third floor (laughter).  So I, I did that.  And so, I was over talking about what I had done and this guy walked in the door.  He was standing with his arms folded like this.  And he says, some guy came in and asked the guy a question who I was explaining what I had done.  And this guy interrupted.  And so, somebody said, well, who said that?  He said, I did, in the conversation so I knew who, who the, who the main guy was at that point.  So, he said to me, he said, we're going to go into computers at the newspaper and I want to know where to put one, so you walk around with me.  So I went walking around with this guy, walking around.  They were just on top of each other in that place.  And I said, well, I know this building has the back of the third floor that you can still do.  He said, I'll call you.  A couple of days, he called me--bring contract, brought the contract over.  He said, how much things gonna cost?  I told him.  What's your fee?  I told him.  He's penciling in all in.  What's your retainer?  I told him.  Called the secretary, bring the check.  I said, this is the way it's supposed to work.  So, I go back.  This guy goes off to Vietnam to do stories in Vietnam.  When he gets back, the building's done.  His office is there.  He comes back.  He calls me on the phone, said, come on over, bring a contract.  I said, what are you doing now?  He's--just bring a contract.  So we go over.  His office was in the top corner of the building, pushed a button on his desk, drapes open.  He looks down.  He said, see that.  I said, yeah, the railroad tracks, I've seen the railroad tracks.  They're my railroad tracks.  So what'd you do with the railroad tracks?  We're going to build a building right on top of it.  What's it gonna cost?  I said what?  So I said, okay, it's this big by this big.  It's going to be this--how many floors do you want?  He said, da da da.  I said, oh, da da da.  I gave him the numbers.  He said okay, what's your fee?  I told him.  He said, what's your retainer?  I told him.  Barbara, bring him a check.  In less than a week, I made $50,000.  Nobody worked on the project but me.  I designed the whole thing and brought it back to him.  He said, let's do it.  I thought that's the way it's supposed to work.  Okay.  This way, all of the rest of them worked.  All right.  I'm finally there, I'm there.  I transcended the racism.  I've done all of that stuff.  I am going to need the pattern to see how this works.
Story_ID: 72073
Speaker 1: I mean the last thing you said was something that you thought--well, it's pretty easy, you get, you, you got it made so--
Speaker 2: Right, yeah.  This is the way it worked, you know.
Speaker 1: It's going to work now.
Speaker 2: I was making plenty of money, you know.  It was rolling easy.  I had a great client, you know, and I was looking for more of the same.  I was vice president of the Wichita Chamber.  I served on four United Fund Boards, you know, I was into everything, I mean, into absolutely everything.  My oldest daughter was in high school.  And my wife [Gloria McAfee]--I was coming back from a trip somewhere.  And my wife told me and said, I'm going to leave the car at the airport for you because Cheryl's in this play at school.  And I said--So, just in case you're late, you know.  So, well, I was on time.  I ran out and got in the car and drove out, and rushed in just as the house lights were going down.  And it was--I saw my wife and I said, what's the name of the play?  And Gloria said, "Can Can".  I said, "Can Can"?  What are you talking about?  What role is my daughter playing in this?  And she said, well, in the opening scene, she's in the chorus.  My daughter's in the chorus?  I was really upset.  My baby--no, what are you talking about?
Speaker 1: "Can Can".
Speaker 2: So there's my baby out there dancing in "Can Can".  I'm going like, my God!  We lived in this little two-bedroom house.  I realized I was so busy that maybe I hadn't done the things I was supposed to.  I bought this piece of ground four or five years before and designed the house.  I hadn't done anything.  I decided I'm going to break ground on this house.  Well, we had a special table because when Cheryl was four, and I worked for somebody else before I opened my own office.  And she and her mother were dropping me off.  And Cheryl looked at me and she said, daddy, don't be mean to anybody today.  And I thought, what is she talking about?  And then I thought, wait a minute.  How do I come home?  And I remembered, I said, I come home angry 'cause I don't like this place where I work.  And so, I went and bought this special table.  And I said, this table is for the family.  We only talking about family and I might have breakfast and dinner, and I will not be out of this house unless it's absolutely necessary.  And that is what we did.  So at this special table, Cheryl is in high school.  And Cheryl was the kind of person that every time if she saw a, a dog got hit by a car, or Cheryl wanted to be a vet and save all the animals in the world.  So we were sitting at this table one day and Cheryl says, daddy, I made up my mind what I want to be.  I said, what's that?  So I want to be an architect.  And I mean, I absolutely couldn't believe it, you know.  I'm going like what, you know?  And so, I had done something one day.  I had asked them years before.  I said, look, I want you guys to know what your daddy does, but not that you got to do what I do.  I want you to take a beginning course in drafting, and so they did.  And when they all finished, we put them down in the floor in the living room.  And they all made excellent grades.  So I went and got mine out of the closet and I put mine down.  And here were these drawings.  Beginning drafting is the same since Michelangelo did it.  And they made better grades on some of them than I did.  So all of a sudden, daddy, the giant, got to be the right size.  They had the confidence.  The little one, ever since she was four, I'm going to be an architect like my daddy.  Cheryl was all over the place.  Pam didn't really know where Pam was going.  Well, Cheryl decides she's going to be an architect, so I'm trying to be cool, not like I was just now.  I'm trying to be cool as well.  You and your mother go pick out some curriculum books and decide where you want to go and make some trips.  So they made trips all over the place.  We're back at the special table.  Cheryl says, daddy, I made up my mind where I want to go to school.  I said, where is that?  Kansas State [University, Manhattan, Kansas].  I said, Kansas State?  You didn't go to Kansas State.  You didn't visit there.  I know.  I said, why did you make up your mind to go there?  That's where all my friends are going (laughter).  Real intelligent to see the process--cost me a lot of money in the process, but that was the way it went.  So she goes to Kansas State.  She's done marvelously well.
Story_ID: 72074
Speaker 1: Charyl gets through high school.  Cheryl goes to Kansas State [University, Manhattan, Kansas].  Cheryl's in her fifth year, thesis year.  Charyl's a freshman.  Cheryl and Charyl.
Speaker 2: And how do you spell the--what is the difference in the spelling?
Speaker 1: Cheryl is C-H-E-R-Y-L.  Charyl is C-H-A-R-Y-L.  Pam was in the middle, okay (laughter).  So Cheryl, right up there at the top of her class.  Cheryl has a marvelous personality.  I mean she just meets no strangers.  She just really--well, Charyl follows her.  The first thing is they would call Charyl, Cheryl.  That didn't work.  Well, so Cheryl comes home and says, daddy, I want to go to grad school.  I'm going like you don't need to go to grad school, you know.  You already got a job.  You don't need, you know, I need you, you know, da da, but she said, I want to go grad school.  I said, okay, where is you want to go to grad school?  So I applied two places.  I said, already?  Said yes.  I said, where is that?  MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts] and Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts].  I said, uh-hum, the two, the two best, two most expensive, of course.  I said, okay, uh-hum.  So, I'm thinking I'm the one that--'cause I had her--my friend who was working in the same office in Boston [Massachusetts]--I got Cheryl an internship to work in that office.  But she went back and fell in love with Boston and all the excitement that was going on.  So, she ends up--she gets, she gets a notice from MIT first.  And it says she's been accepted; she got an $8,000 scholarship.  And four days later, she got the same acceptance from Harvard with this long look on her face.  I said, what's the matter?  She said, well, I guess I'll go to MIT.  So what are you talking about?  Well, I guess I'll go to MIT.  They offered me a scholarship.  I said, well, it looks like you made up your mind where you want to go.  She said, what are you talking about?  And I told her.  She said, I, I'd rather go to Harvard, but they didn't offer me any scholarship.  I said, don't worry about it.  Well, we had a family meeting.  And we all decided we'll all go to poor house, but you go to Harvard.  So that's what we did.  So Cheryl is at Harvard.  And Cheryl calls me up and she says, daddy, get Charyl out of K-State.  I said what's the matter?  I said, is Charyl unhappy?  Say, yeah, daddy.  Well, Charyl hadn't said a word to me.  So I called Charyl, I said, Charyl, what's wrong?  She said, I just don't want to be here.  Well, she didn't say why she didn't want to be there.  I said, where do you want to go?  Said I don't know--the University of Texas [Austin, Texas] which was down I-35 South, or University of Nebraska [Lincoln, Nebraska] which is up 35 North.  I said, I, I'm on my way.  You make up your mind where you want to go by the time I get there.  So I got there.  Said I want to go to the University of Nebraska.  I said okay.  We packed her clothes, put all the rest of the stuff on a bus.  And a little Mustang that I was driving--drove everything else in Lincoln, Nebraska.  She was enrolled in the University of Nebraska the very, very next morning.  Well, it didn't hurt because I was one of the Professor of the Advisory Committee for the School of Architecture, but it--she would have gotten in any place.  It wouldn't make any difference, but and, and does marvelous work.  I mean, she's really, really talented.  Anyway, so she finished the University of Nebraska, and then went to the University of Texas and got her master's.  She and Cheryl, they collaborate very well together.  They're the ones who made the decision.  There's one East Coast education, and so now they wanted something different.  So she goes to Texas, and, and does marvelous there, and, and then worked for the largest firm in Texas for about four or five years before she decided she was ready to open the office in Dallas [Texas] and has done that.  And it's just growing leaps and bounds.  Our clients in Dallas are not only the city, but Dallas County Community College, Ross Perot, Jr., Minyards Grocery chain.  I mean, just a lot of, you know, major names in the State of Texas that are our clients.  And so, she's done marvelously well.
Story_ID: 72075
Speaker 1: She and her husband, Kenneth, who is an electrical engineer, does work for us, too.  Kenneth and Charyl have our grandchildren, Winston who's the oldest, and Cindy, she's a little girl, not little, she's growing like this.  But so they come to Wichita [Kansas] every summer, and grandmother [Gloria McAfee] takes out all the school books.  And they go to school the whole time they're here.  It's a marvelous relationship.  And 'cause I, I really credit my wife and my mother [Willie Anna McAfee] and father [Arthur McAfee, Sr.] with the real success of my daughters 'cause they were so close to them.  And I was always on the road, work all hours of day and night and, but mommy and daddy and Gloria were always right there for them.  And that's why I really give the success of where they are.
Story_ID: 72076
Speaker 1: So I, you know, get out here [Wichita, Kansas].  Things are going well.  I got clients all over every place.  I get my first project done, Atlanta [Georgia], it's a $35 million rapid rail station.  Again, I do a marvelous job on design and detail on everything and got all kinds of accolades for it.  And then I get a job down in Miami [Florida] doing a [Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.] rapid rail station.  And then I got a job with the Federal Aviation Administration [FAA] doing seventy-four computer centers all over every place--210, $20 million  worth of work--lasted eight years, you know.  I mean, I'm, I'm on a serious professional roll, you know.  And, and, but at the same time, at the same time, no matter where I was professionally, it's where am I as a person?  Where am I as a black man in America?  And it was always there, you know, I couldn't belong to the Wichita Club.  This was a club where every time they'd bring in a guest speaker for a series at WSU [Wichita State University, Wichita, Kansas], they would have the guest speaker down there for dinner.  And the night, the next morning he would speak.  Well, [A.] Price Woodard, who was the first and only black mayor this town has ever had, and I ran his camp- political campaign, as I have numerous others.  But Price and I would be the only two black people invited.  And so, you know, I didn't like that.  I don't like people having to pay for me, you know.  So I decide I want to be a member of the Wichita Club.  So I have the owner of the newspaper, a guy by the name of Britt Brown, and the owner of the largest construction company in the State of Kansas, a guy named Martin [K.] Eby, Sr.--they are the two people who recommended my membership.  My membership got posted at 11:00.  They took it down before noon 'cause it had twenty-six typewritten letters in opposition of my membership to the Wichita Club.  Said, well, we like Charlie but, you know, all those other black people may want to join?  Big deal.  Well, so this kind of stuff went on and on and on.
Story_ID: 72077
Speaker 1: Wichita State University [Wichita, Kansas] had a serious tragedy.  A football team plane crashed in Colorado--killed a bunch of players and coaches.  Everybody--
Speaker 2: And when was this?  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Oh, God, the exact date, probably now 25, 26 years ago, something like that.
Speaker 2: Okay, the mid-70s [1970s], I guess?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  And so, I get a phone call one day from the head of one of the television stations here in town.  Charles, we want you to serve on the entertainment committee for the fundraiser we're having for the memorial thing.  I said, okay.  So would you meet us down at the Wichita Club [Wichita, Kansas] for lunch?  I said, yes, sure.  So I went on down.  Well, only three people there, the head of the NBC station; the CBS station, and the, and the ABC station, and, and me.  So I know, well, there must be something in this 'cause they wouldn't have invited me to this.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's what (unclear).
Speaker 1: So they said, Charles, we really need a headliner.  We got a number of people who have already agreed to be here, but the top two shows in the country right now are Flip Wilson and Bill Cosby.  And we were just wondering if you had any contacts.  I'll be right back.  I went out to the phone.  I dialed Los Angeles [California], the mayor's private number.  I said, hi, this is Charlie.  Is Tom [Bradley] in?  Yes, Mr. McAfee, the mayor is here.  Bradley got on the phone.  I told him what was going on.  He said, yeah, I read about that.  He said, but you won't be able to get Flip.  Flip is doing his shows live and so, you, you can't get him right now.  He said, but Cosby will do it for you.  I said, you sure?  He said, this is his private secretary's number.  You call this number, tell her what you want.  So I called the woman.  She said, who are you?  I said, I'm Charles McAfee.  What, what do you have to do with the university?  I said, I'm just a friend of the university and I'm on the entertainment committee.  And we're trying to get Mr. Cosby to come headline this program.  Said he's not doing any more benefits the rest of this year.  I said, listen, you don't understand.  We really need to have Mr. Cosby come do this.  And she said--  I said, I'm going to send you some information.  So I sent her some information overnight.  But I went back to the table, and I told them what I'd found out, and I expected a call back from Cosby and we'll know then.  Well, I called the woman the next day.  She said, I just got the information and Mr. Cosby hadn't even had a chance to see it, and said, now tell me again, who are you and what's your status with the university?  I said, I'm just a friend of the university and that's it.  I'm just on the committee.  And she said, Mr. Cosby is not going to do any more benefits the rest of this year.  I said, "Sister", you do not understand what I'm talking about.  She said, why didn't you say so (laughter)?  So she says, I've been trying to find who you are.  And I said yeah, well.  And she said, and how did you get this phone number?  I said, Tom Bradley.  You mean, our Tom Bradley?  I said, yeah, our Tom Bradley--he's one of my dearest friends.  Oh, so this is what happened.  Cosby decides to do it, but she says--she calls me and says, he's on a noon time program in New York, and he has a late night performance in [Las] Vegas [Nevada].  I said, we'll work it out so that we'll pick him up in a private jet, bring him to Wichita, and fly him to Vegas--done deal.  Guess who wasn't on the private jet--me.
Speaker 2: Well, what happened?
Speaker 1: Well, it wasn't my jet.  Okay.  And they all wanted the chance to be with Bill Cosby.  When I saw Cosby a few years later, we were playing tennis--in fact, down in New Orleans [Louisiana].  And Gordon Parks was there and Arthur Ashe, and a lot of other people.  But anyway, but Cosby said, there's the disappearing man (laughter).  So it was kinda funny, you know, because, you know, every time you do something that you think really good, unselfish, you're gonna do this 'cause it's right to do it.  And then the foolishness still raises its ugly head, you see.  And so, it just keeps on going.
Story_ID: 72078
Speaker 1: And what I don't understand, you know, like now, is, is that Cheryl [McAfee-Mitchell] came home for six years and worked here in Wichita [Kansas] for six years.  I mean, she worked on projects all around the country for me everywhere--Washington [D.C.] and Atlanta [Georgia] and Miami [Florida], every place.  I came home after the interviews on the [1996] Olympics.  And I came home and I told her, I said, we got the Olympic project.  She looked me dead in the eyes--said, daddy, I'm out of here.  And I can't hardly get her to come back.  And people will say to me, oh, Cheryl's doing the Olympics, like Cheryl was doing them--not my firm [Charles F. McAfee Architects and Planners].  It was okay that Cheryl was doing them, but not my firm.  Okay.  And people will say, when is Cheryl coming back home?  I said for what, for what?  You didn't make her feel comfortable when she was here.  Why should she come back now?  We got three schools in Wichita bond issue.  We did nineteen in Oklahoma City.  This is my town.  And there wasn't another architect in this town who wasn't been paid by the district who worked as hard on this bond issue as I did.  This bond issue was passed by the African American community.  Right down there on 21st Street where you came, coming this way, there's a Center for Health and Wellness that has a, has a voting position at that location.  Eighty-five percent of the people that voted, voted for the bond issue, that the highest voting precinct in the city for the bond issue.  And throughout the whole black community, there was a black vote that really went overwhelmingly for that bond issue.  One black contract has one job, one black contract has another job, and I have three schools (laughter).
Speaker 2: That's how many schools have been--
Speaker 1: It's close to ninety.
Speaker 2: And you have three?
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, close to ninety.
Speaker 2: What is the--what's peculiar about Wichita in terms of that, that is just--
Speaker 1: Wichita, my, my hope is, I mean, I really honestly love the city.  I mean, I really do, but I love it like I love my children, you know.  I want you to be really good, good children.  If you're bad, I'm going, I'm going to get you for being bad, but I still want you to be good.  I want you to be the best that you can possibly be.  That's the way I am about the city.  Wichita doesn't have to make all the, all the same mistakes that a lot of other cities have made but we're quickly making all of them.  I mean, we had urban sprawl that just unintelligent and ridiculous.  Okay.  If we didn't have busing, the majority of the schools in the inner city would be black.  And the only thing to keep them from being black is that we bus.
Speaker 2: What, what's the black, pop-, population here like--
Speaker 1: About 10 percent roughly.  It's been 10 percent for a long, long time.  My father [Arthur McAfee, Sr.] saved me a, a brochure of the Chamber of Commerce in the early '30s [1930s] and it said the reason why you come to Wichita is because it's 90 percent native white--
Speaker 2: They have--
Speaker 1: --Native white.  I mean, the name Kansas is Native American.  The city named Wichita is Native American, you know.  But we have the--you just had to keep making these stupid statements and these stupid directions which keep the tension at a level where it has no business being.  So we, we end up, you know, doing all kinds of things.  And, and I stayed here really because of my mother [Willie Anna McAfee] and father.  They're both gone at this point but that's why I stayed.  I mean it was no other reason.  And, unfortunately, there are no McAfees going to be here when I'm gone.  It, it, it's, it's sad because you're out here in the middle of, of almost nowhere where the black population that isn't big enough to do anything.  It isn't big enough to cause anybody any serious problems.
Story_ID: 72079
Speaker 1: But this town still is not capable of allowing talent to rise where it ought to.  We have a bunch of brilliant, brilliant young people who have come through this town. PhDs, doctors, lawyers, all kinds of professionals.  The president we have at university, a Harvard [University, Cambridge Massachusetts] graduate, serves on Harvard Board of Overseers.  Emily Pelton, the associate editor of, of the Washington Post, Kevin Mirron (ph.), mother and father grew up across the street, graduated from Wichita State University [Wichita, Kansas]--all of them that have done marvelous things.  History professors at SMU [Southern Methodist University, Dallas, Texas] and, and PhDs at the University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan], and I don't know.  All over every place, okay.  The guy who, in Atlanta [Georgia], they refer to as Mr. Civil Rights, not Maynard Jackson, it's not Andrew Young.  It's a man by the name of Donald [L.] Hollowell.  He's a lawyer--out of that law firm, four Federal District Court judges out of his law firm.  He was the man who got Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] out of jail.  He's going blind.  If you listen to Vernon Jordan [HM] speak, it's Donald Hollowell.  Okay.  It's the same passion in that very thought out speech process.  It's Donald Hollowell.  Okay.  The only woman, the first woman to win an Academy Award, right out the back door of the Cannes African American Museum, Hattie McDaniel.  And it goes on and on and on.  And what the hell for?  To be mistreated?  I don't think so.  I told Andy Young a long time ago, I said, you know, the Lord knew exactly what he did when he picked you guys to do what you did in a non-violent movement.  There is no question 'cause there are a bunch of us that would have never made it.
Speaker 2: (Unclear).
Speaker 1: They just wouldn't have made it.
Story_ID: 72080
Speaker 1: When I built my house--I rushed to build my house so that Cheryl [McAfee-Mitchell] would live there before she went away to school.  The first night, we started moving in, the drapes weren't up.  We came home.  And the windows in my house are as big as this wall--single pane of glass.  Two of them were broken out.  I didn't report it.  I just had the glass company come out and replace them.
Speaker 2: Now you designed your house, your house yourself?
Speaker 1: Right.  The next night, I was back in the back and I heard Charyl [McAfee-Duncan] scream--my youngest daughter.  And she screamed and I jumped up and I ran down the hall.  And her eyes were this big.  She said, daddy, they're shooting at me.  See, I don't mind what you do to me, but now you're crossing all the boundaries.  You're messing with my family.  I went in and there were two bullet holes.  I did not have a gun in my house.  I haven't had a gun since I was in the military.  I'm looking at my baby scared to death.  I went, I went outdoors with a knife and I planned on killing whoever this was.  Everything I learned in the military--I was ducking and dodging below the trees and running through and finding--I was going to find whoever this was, and I was going to kill him.  There was no question.  I was going to kill him.  And I was going to hang their body on a street light in front of my house.  I came back and I don't know how long I'd been out there.  I didn't find anybody.  The next morning, I started resigning from all kind of boards and committees I was on.  I hated white people, absolutely hated them.  And I never reported it to the police, but I realized at that point, they had turned me into some kind of animal which I didn't like either.  And so I just, at that point, committed myself, number one.  By now, you know, Cheryl is saying she wants to be an architect; and Charyl was already saying; and Pam is somewhere in, in the middle of all of this.  And I hope then, and hope now, that she finally comes to the family business.  But I made up my mind and at that point, I was going to build a hell of a launching pad.  No matter what it is I've done or what I've accomplished, it is no more than a launching pad.  And, you know, my hate just got uncontrollable.  I don't want nobody talking to me.  I didn't want anybody coming close to me 'cause I wasn't really certain what I was going to do.  I mean, I absolutely hated, you know, and I know if I had caught them, I'd have killed them.  There would have been no doubt in my mind about that.  So I just got busy.  I just stayed busy and stayed busy and stayed busy.  I worked ten, twelve hours every day.  I played hard.  I worked hard.  I was just driven by an absolute need to be successful.  And I wasn't going to let much get in my way in the process.  And, you know, I, like I said, the, the biggest, the biggest thing that has ever affected me more than anything--and I didn't really understand this until my wife [Gloria McAfee] was losing the use of her kidneys.  And I went to the doctor with her when they said, you're not going to be successful on the cadaver list, and so we're looking at the opportunity to do a live organ donor.
Story_ID: 69081
Speaker 1: The doctors were telling us that, you know, live organ donor was a possibility, and that they were looking at our three daughters as candidates.  My wife [Gloria McAfee] who was and is a marvelous, marvelous student of her illness, takes her medicine on time and does everything, you know, just right.  And she'd been fine up until then.  She choked up.  She said, I don't want that.  I looked at the doctor and I said, don't worry about it.  I'll do it.  He said, what are you talking about?  I said, I listened to everything you said.  I said, a thousand years ago when we got married, I said, you know, we, we knew we were the same blood type--didn't mean anything.  I said, now of all of a sudden, it could mean everything, and so I will do it.  So they called me up.  He said, how old are you?  I said, well, I'm going to be sixty-two my next birthday.  He said, oh, no, we never had anybody over sixty.  I said, I don't care what you never had.  I'm going to tell you what we're going to do.  So, he tells the story that I threw him down, but I didn't throw him down (laughter).  I didn't do that.
Speaker 2: He says you threw him down?
Speaker 1: Yeah (laughter), but I didn't do that.  So, anyway, so I got this phone call from his office--said, Mr. McAfee, said you can't do this.  I said, why is that?  Said, your medical history.  I said, my medical history, what are you talking about?  So, you're a diabetic.  I said, I'm not diabetic.  So if I was diabetic, I know I couldn't do this.  So, but that's what it says.  Said on what?  Said the one you filled out, so read it good.  Everything on there, it said, have you ever had this, this, this, this, this?  I've never had any of those things.  The only one that I said yes to was a question that said, is there anyone in your immediate family that's a diabetic?  Well, yes, my wife.  Oh. So I thought I'd have some fun.  I said, but there is something I do have.  And she said in a very serious voice, what's that?  I said, I have kryptonite.  And she said, what's that?  I said, oh, you're too young to remember that a few years back, a far out planet exploded and a capsule floated down and landed in the middle of the United States.  It actually landed in my mother's backyard.  And whenever I need some additional strength, I just go out and uncover it--breathe on it for extra strength.  She says, you crazy.  I said, I know I am, but there wasn't a question.  If there had been a question that said, are you crazy, I would have said yes.  Well, everything started and I'm taking all these tests and everything.  And, finally, everything passes.  So, supposedly, the next lab--well, next to the last big test, well, they would take blood from me one day and give it to Gloria the next, to make certain that it didn't--. And so, it got to be a joke and it was like, Ms. McAfee, your kryptonite is here.  You know, it's kind of a joke.  So, Cheryl [McAfee-Mitchell] and I, we're in New York at an Olympic Board meeting, and having dinner with Gordon Parks over to the chase (ph.).  Got back to the hotel feeling very good and everything, my light was blinking on the phone.  And it was a message from Gloria and said, we have to take the last test on Friday.  The operation is set for Monday morning.  Great.  So I end up, rest over the next morning for the meeting, told everybody, I'm sorry, but I gotta go, told them what the reason was.  I left and ran out to LaGuardia [Airport, New York, New York].  I ran up to TWA [Trans World Airlines]; it was four hours late.  I said, oh, God.  Ran down to United [Airlines], hopped on the United going to Chicago [Illinois], barely made the flight.  Got to Chicago.  United from Chicago to Wichita [Kansas] was four hours late.
Story_ID: 69082
Speaker 1: I get back.  I didn't know what this test was I was supposed to take.  Well, it's a test to clean you out, so I'm taking this fool medicine.  You can imagine--I got no sleep that night.  So the next morning we go over, and they do the last test.  And the test is really an interesting test.  They insert a thing in your veins or arteries or wherever and squirt this stuff up in you.  And you can look up at the television monitor and, and it shows where it goes.  I said, what are we doing this for?  Said it's to see which kidney you want to take.  I said, what difference does it make?  Said, well, you could--they both look okay, so you could take the one out of your stomach or the one out of your back.  I'm thinking, well, my back muscles are probably more important than my stomach muscle.  So I said, we'll take the one out of my stomach.  Monday morning, we go to the hospital.  They're starting to give us the anesthesia and before that, they're checking my blood pressure.  And the nurses are going, it's strange.  I said, what's strange?  Said your blood pressure is normal.  I said, what is wrong with that?  So when somebody is normally going into something like this, you know, their blood pressure is gonna be a little funny.  I said, well, I'm absolutely convinced that this is okay.  Now is there something you haven't told me?  No.  I said, well, we fine.  Went on through this operation.  All three of the daughters are out front.  They're telling everybody that maybe six or eight weeks before, you know, the kidney starts to function right and all this kind of stuff and everything.  The surgeon comes out in the middle of the surgery and tells them, the kidney started functioning immediately.  Everybody all happy.  The first day, they put me in a room, and Gloria is in recovery.  And then they bring Gloria in the room, and right after they bring Gloria in the room, I get a call from downstairs--says the news media is here and wants to do a story.  I said, absolutely not.  I said, I get way too much publicity.  I don't want to do this.  This is a private family affair.  So but you don't understand.  This would really help a lot of people.  Help, what are you talking about?  I said, I'll tell you what.  You, the surgeons, come up.  We'll talk.  So the surgeons came in.  Dr. Shield (ph.) said, Charles, he said, there are really an awful lot of people who are afraid of the surgery, but with somebody as famous as you--I said, don't do that.  He said, well, what else do I say?  Somebody as well-known as you, they're going to know that somebody as well-known have done this, and it will give them the courage to do it.  I looked at him.  And then he said, and the highest at risk group in the country, African Americans.  I said, what?  Well, my sister was sitting there who hates my name in the newspaper.  I looked at my sister and I said, what do you think?  And she said, it's okay.  I looked at Gloria.  I said, what do you think?  You feel like doing this?  Yep, we'll do it. I said okay.  So I told Dr. Shield and Dr. Smith, I said, let me tell you something.  I said, for every one card I get, my wife will get ten.  And they didn't understand what I was talking about.  My wife taught school and principal at the school for 30, 35 years somewhere around there--well, they brought the newspeople up.  And then the people who had followed me and Gordon Parks in various parts and places in the country and done stories on Gordon and all kinds of stuff, and this is a newspaper that I've done.  And television stations, you know, that have a lot, you know, people involved with that I know.  And I said, where is this story going?  Oh, just locally.  Well, they did the pictures and everything.  That's when they went back.  That newspaper, it was all over the country, night real chain (unclear), and so it's the "Miami Herald" and the "Detroit Free Press", the "Charlotte Observer", you know, I mean it was everywhere.  That afternoon, flowers started showing up from every place, all over the country.  And I'm going, how did people know we were in here?  So I get a phone call from one of them.  Mac, I saw the article in the paper.  From Houston, when did you see the--this morning.  What?  I'm going like, oh, man, you know.  So these flowers just keep showing up, keep--they were so glad to get us out of there.  We were only in the hospital four days.  Seven days, I'm back at work.  And, like I said, a lot of my friends got mad at me because their wives would say, oh, honey, isn't that romantic?  Would you do that for me?  And they would go, well, I, I, so I tell them, say yes, because the percentage of the possibility of husbands and wives matching, it's like one to 10 million, so either say yes.  Don't worry about it--probably won't happen anyway.  But so, you know, I, I'm, I'm fine with everything that's going on.  Everything is fine.

Speaker 1: NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] had a roast to raise money, a fundraiser, and they were roasting us.  And a lot of people got up and said some very nice complimentary things and everything.  My middle daughter, who is the writer, who is really good, really, really good--Pam got up there and said, all of you people are praising my father, like he's some kind of hero.  Said you don't understand.  My father is really a coward because he did not want to sit out there for six hours in that waiting room crying the whole time like the three of us did.  He went in there and went to sleep.  And everybody just cracked up.  I was laughing so hard I didn't know what to--but then it hit me.  What did I really do?  I scared them to death.  Their mother [Gloria McAfee] and father were in an operating room.  There was no absolute guarantee nothing was going to happen, but I hadn't thought about that. Okay.
Story_ID: 69084
Speaker 1: I remember asking Gordon Parks [HM] three weeks ago.  And I was reading his manuscript.  His second wife was a woman named Liz Campbell.  She was very young.  She was twenty years younger than Gordon when they got married.  I said, Gordon, how did Liz handle what you were going through?  He said, she didn't.  I said, let me tell you something.  One day Malcolm X drives up to your house.  You guys are getting ready to have dinner on Long Island [New York].  And Malcolm X is telling you where he is in his Muslim faith at this point, and that he's going to be at the Audubon Ballroom tomorrow to give a speech on where he is, and was inviting you to come.  Just fortunately, you couldn't come because you had something else already scheduled.  And Malcolm dies.  And the word is out--Malcolm, first, Gordon Parks, second.  And "Life Magazine" snatches you and your three children by your first wife and your new wife, and take you down to the Caribbean for two to three months with armed guards.  You know, I never thought about what I was putting my family through all of that time.  I watched Andy Young [Andrew Young, HM] be as level-headed as anybody I've ever seen but at the same time, the Secret Service are on both sides of the tennis courts.  And I watched the whole bunch of us go through this foolishness of having to be honest with yourselves and say what it is you have to say, and what it is you mean about the way things are, and realize that there are an awful bunch of very low life people out there who, number one, will hurt your family in the process.  And so, you know, you sit there and you look at that, and you say, Gordon, how did Liz Campbell Parks take that?  And you answer to me, she didn't.  And so, you know, when I read that Barry Bonds is having threats on his life, and when I read that Tiger Woods is having threats on his life, when is all this gonna stop?  See, when I first came home, there was a city councilman stood up in the City Council Chambers and said unsolicited--it wasn't even on the agenda.  There was no black issues on the table.  He just stood up and made a statement that when you black people--and I was the only one in the Council Chambers--when you black people learn how to speak good English, work hard in the community, dress well, everything is going to be all right.
Speaker 2: This is, this is what year, roughly what--
Speaker 1: This is '68 [1968], something like that, you know. And, so what happened was, was it, my daughters who were very, very young at that point, went and asked my mother [Willie Anna McAfee]--said, grandma, why does the man talk about daddy like that?  And my mother said, God don't like ugly.  The man died of lung cancer in about six months.  My daughters believe to this point that my, my mother talked to God.  I think she did, too.

Speaker 1: Sir, let, let me ask you that.  I'd be remissive if I did not ask you--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --about your career as an architect--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and about what your philosophy is in terms of building a community?  What, what, what's your, what distinguishes you from other architects?  And so, can, can you kind of give us an idea of what, you know, what materials do you favor and what, what style are you using?  Who inspires you and--
Speaker 2: I was asked that question in Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 1: Who--who inspired by you?
Speaker 2: I, I was asked that question in Chicago.  And there was a guy sitting next to me who I later found out was [Ludwig] Mies van der Rohe's grandson.  And I said that I was inspired by two architects.  One was Mies van der Rohe because of the simplicity of what he does, the simplicity of the materials they use, the simplicity of the details, that we don't clutter things, that we make it as simple as possible.  We make it as functional as possible.  And that what really makes a building function are the people inside that building, the people create that final image, whether it's the color that you're wear in clothes; the color that you paint a wall; the kind of fabric that you bring in, and that's right.  In other words, at that point, the people now become a part of all this thing.  If I design everything, everything, there's no reason for you to be there.  If you just gotta come into a space and function in the space and have no opportunity to, to put this picture on the wall, 'cause I've already put all the pictures on the wall.  If, if I've done of all that for you, then what are you?  So I design buildings that, number one, the people are the final quotient of the design.  It is they who finalize what's there.  And so, it was the detail of, of Mies van der Rohe.  It was the beauty of the life of Paul Williams that made me believe I could do what I have done.
Speaker 1: Now, just, just to make sure I can--now Mies, Mies van der Rohe is, is German, right, or is he--
Speaker 2: Mies van der Rohe came out of the Bauhaus Group in Europe right in front of [Adolf] Hitler, chasing them all out.  There were a number of them who came out at that same time.  Paul Williams was the first, and the only black, doing all the stuff he did.  On the West Coast, he became the architect of the stars.  He did houses for Frank Sinatra and a lot of other people--did the hospital, the Children's Cancer Hospital, for Danny Thomas in Tennessee.
Speaker 1: In Memphis, yeah?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  But such, such a gentleman.  I mean, the man was so talented.  He did the, the Spider Restaurant.  It's the theme building at the, at the LA Airport.  One time I went out--
Speaker 1: That's the, yeah, that's the, that's the landmark in LA Airport [LAX, Los Angeles International Airport].
Speaker 2: It is, absolutely--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --absolutely.
Story_ID: 69086
Speaker 1: And I would go out and visit and I'd visit him [Paul Williams] and he'd say, hi, Charles, let's go to the baseball game.  Well, we'd hop in his Lincoln and we'd go off, you know, see a baseball game, you know.  And he was such an inspiration to me.  And I remember one time--somebody said something and he was sitting at his desk and he rolled out a piece of paper.  And he put a pencil here and he drew a line like that.  And it was so straight.  I was looking for the straight edge but there was none.  And, and, and, so we had marvelous conversations so all of a sudden in a book, the United States Information Agency [UISA] published a book for distribution at a function in Dakar, Africa.  And it was about black entertainers and professionals and famous people and they had Duke Ellington and--
Speaker 2: Oh, that's the, that's the first Pan-African Festival, Festival of the Arts in 1966--
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: --in Dakar, Senegal.
Speaker 1: That's right, that's right.  And they had this book.  And the book had, you know, had Duke Ellington in it.  It had Paul Williams and it had all kinds of people, you know, sculptors and musicians and poets and everybody.  And on the last two pages, it was titled, "And here come the young Turks", and here was Charles McAfee. Standing there looking mean, you know.  I would, I know where they got the picture from, you know.  And I thought and I looked at it.  When I first saw it, I picked it up and I called Paul.  I said, have you seen this book?  He said no.  I said, well, I'm really sorry they wrote it up the way they did.  He laughed at me.  He said, you don't need to worry about stuff like that, you know.  It was one of the first things that anybody had ever written about me nationally and it didn't come off, you know.  I mean, here's this young black architect, you know, who's going to sweep everybody else out of the way.  And, you know, I'm going like, you know, so we laughed about that.  It was really funny, you know.  But it was, it was all of those kinds of things, you know, that have molded what I do and how I do it.
Story_ID: 69087
Speaker 1: And I know that my architecture is not everybody's--my house is not everybody's.  But you asked me earlier about where do I--my favorite vacation spot.  I recently made a trip.  I was--left here; went to Chicago [Illinois] for two days for an organ transplant board meeting, our committee meeting; left there, flew to Hartford [New Hampshire]; spent a couple of days with my daughter, Pam.  We visited the Piquin (ph.) Museum, had a marvelous time; went over to Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts], spent five days over there in an executive seminar program; flew down to New York and spent three days with Gordon [Parks, HM].  He (unclear) for me every evening.  And got on a plane and came home.  And I went in my house and I sat there and I look out my windows, and that's the greatest place in the world.  It's my house.  It speaks to me, you know.  I only hope it speaks to my wife [Gloria McAfee] as well as it does me, but it is a house that I interpreted my personality.  I tell people, you know, I am here to interpret your personalities and what you do.  There was no project that you do that is as sensitive and as intimate as a private residence for someone.
Speaker 2: That's right.  And, and having designed your home, I mean, that must really me, I mean, a special thing if you're ever going to something you designed yourself.
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.
Story_ID: 69088
Speaker 1: When we did Andy Young's [Andrew Young] house, you know, it was the same thing.  I mean, it was the relationships that I'd with Andy and Jean [Young] all those years and how well I knew them and how, honestly, they talked to me about, and what I did, you know.  I even helped her hang paintings on the wall that were gifts of the Chinese government.  And one day, she said to me, she said, Charlie, what are we gonna do with Andrew's cane collection?  As long as I've known this man, I'm going like, cane collection?  What are you talking about?  And I'm thinking, what kind of cane collection?  She said, every place he goes, they give him hand carved canes, and so he has this marvelous collection.  I said, where is it?  So she showed me this beautiful woven African basket that they were putting all the canes in.  I took that basket, took it over to, in the great room, and put it right in the corner.  I said, right there, that's where it is.  But, you know, we did the house that I was showing you earlier.  It's out west of town.  And the guy who owned the NBC Television Stations here, he came in my office one morning very apologetically--said, Charles, do you, do you do houses?  And I said, yes, I said I probably do sometimes four or five customers into the year.  I love to do.  He said, can you go out and ride out and look at my site tomorrow?  I said sure.  He said, it's about fifteen miles out there.  So we drove out there and there were five family houses, two swimming pools, and their own private lake.  And he said, the house that my wife and I use as a weekend cottage is about 2,000 square feet.  He said, we're offering it to our son.  Well, he was trying to bribe his son to come back to Wichita [Kansas] to get in the family business.  So he says, and so we want to build one out here some place, you tell us where it ought to go.  And they had this sloop like this that went down to the lake.  And I walked all around out there and I said right there.  He said there?  I said yeah.  He said, why there?  I said, I'll show you.  So we went back and talked to his wife.  And we're talking about building this 2,000 square foot house.  She said, no, I want the rooms like this.  So I said, uh-hum, 'cause I'm looking at him, you know.  Well, he's saying, that's what she wants.  I said okay.  So, 'cause this is when you really get in it, you know, wife saying one thing, husband saying something else, and you better make certain that everybody's on the same wavelength before you finally get this thing done.  So I design this house. We started building it and everything.  And there was a little scrawny mulberry tree right down in the middle of this sloop.  And I told the contractor, don't touch that.  Put some berries around it.  Make certain you don't touch that tree.  Now that tree is a beautiful tree.  And the house looks down on to the lake, but the wood walkways trellis down to the lake.  This house has a huge great room with a very large fireplace at one end and all the way through, and a spiral staircase that goes down to the lower level, but then opens out on the lower level, and it all views the lake.  Won an EIA Award for it.  She called me a number of years later and she said, Charles, I want to thank you.  I said, for what?  Said for giving me my husband back.  I said what?  She said he used to leave home most of the time before 7 and got home after 7.  Said now, he leaves home about 9, 9:30, and 3:30, 4:00, he's home.  We weren't even supposed to live out there.  This was the weekend house.  We're still living at that--we don't live in town any more.  We live out here.  Those are the kind of things, you know, to let you know that you really did it right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, you created more than a house.  You actually created a home.
Speaker 1: Absolutely, absolutely.  We have two others right now that we're doing--one in, one in the valley just west, I mean, just east of downtown San Diego [California] for a family that has that same kind of passion.  One for a couple of doctors--the woman is a transplant physician in Tampa [Florida].  Back support of Jack Nicklaus Golf Course--gate, gated community, same kind of passion, same kind, you know, that we worked and worked and worked and worked.  Talked about, talked about--till we know that we got it right.  But what finally makes it right is them occupying the space.
Story_ID: 69089
Speaker 1: First off, I wanted to ask you about the materials that you use--what materials you favor when you're building a house?  Now, it's--are, are most of your projects houses?
Speaker 2: No--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --no.  In fact, very few of them are single family houses.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: It runs in phases as to what we do.  We've done a lot of rail projects, a rapid rail station in Miami [Florida], Atlanta [Georgia], done a lot of computer centers; in fact, seventy-four of them for the Federal Aviation Administration [FAA] in every state in the country.  We're now doing a lot of airport work, Dallas/Fort Worth [International Airport], Atlanta [Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport].  So it, it just--it, it sort of runs in cycles.  We do a lot of, awful lot, a lot of school type projects and things.  There are a lot of planning projects, both rural and urban, you know, kind of settings.  But when it comes down to the selection of materials, it really has to do with what is the function and whatever this project is.  Where is it?  Are there code requirements for what happens?  For instance, the newspaper, "Eastwing", the newspaper I did, by the time we did an analysis, the rolls of paper, the floor load had to be 400 pounds a square foot.  There was not another building in Wichita, Kansas at that time.  Most buildings are designed for about 100 pounds a square foot.  Here is this building now, 400 pounds a square foot--had all the requirements of fire proof, you never need them.  Well, by the time I got through, I mean this building was almost a concrete cube that I was chipping holes out of.  So the outside of the building took on the balance of the concrete.  The least amount of concrete I used was on the exterior walls.  So it just evolved out of that--it, 'cause it was put on a building that isn't the same style.  I've done buildings like, for instance, at Wichita State University [Wichita, Kansas] on their campus which is all brick.  We designed the McKnight Art Center in the (unclear) Museum of Art.  And it's out of brick, a lot of different shapes and things, but it does respect modularity of the brick.  I don't like to cut brick--never--I don't like to remake plywood.  I like to be able to design buildings that have respect for what it is I'm getting.  And, and, and that's what I, that's what I do.  A simple house that everybody wants to call affordable, I generally do out of combinations of wood; easy to manufacture; easy to get the prices down to where people can afford them, but yet instill the quality of the, of the, of the shelter is far better than they used to live in.  So, that is a successful material for me.  I don't have any favorite material.  I come to favorite conclusions once I know what is I'm trying to accomplish.  And, and, so, I don't have any--well, I wish I could use that on my next project kind of thing.  I don't, I don't have those kinds of feelings about what I do.
Story_ID: 69090
Speaker 1: Now, do, do most of your contracts come through the public sector or--
Speaker 2: That, too, has run in cycles.  Sometimes, like I say, when I, when I first did the, that first house that was an FHA [Federal Housing Administration] project, when I looked up, I had fourteen FHA projects, building apartments and all kinds of stuff.  When I was doing the stuff for FAA [Federal Aviation Administration] with all the computer centers that I was doing, I would let evolve the airport work that we're doing.  I'd like to go after projects I've never done before.  The very first house I did, won a design award.  The very first modular house I did, won a design award.  The very first chemical laboratory I ever did, won a design award.  The very first museum I did, won a design award.  So, I like the challenge of always staying a student of what I do.  The day that I think I don't need to listen, or the day that I think I don't need to study, that's when I'm going to retire because then, my head would have gotten so out of proportion.  A lot of people think it already has, but my head would have gotten so far out of proportion that I would think there's nothing else I could learn.  And that's never gonna be true.  The one thing that--when we were doing the Olympics with all the variety of all the projects that were there at the same time, I still had this great, great desire to make certain that people in this country could be housed economically and safely.  And so, I came back with my friends, the Jacksons, that you're going to talk to--
Speaker 1: These are the funeral directors--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: -- Andrew and I mean Anderson [Eugene "Genie" Jackson, HM] and--
Speaker 2: And Abner [Jean "Val" Jackson, HM].
Speaker 1: --Abner Jackson, right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  We call them Val and Gene (laughter).  They're marvelous people.  But I came back with my friends and for the second time, I started this modular system [McAfee Modular Systems].  We put the factory right in the middle of the community.  We hired people that had never worked on construction before.  In three or four months, we had women who could drive all as good as any man who'd been doing it all his life.  One young Hispanic woman, when we took her for a presentation down in Fort Worth [Texas], I said, Diane, stand up and tell the council people what you do in the factory.  Said if they let me alone, I'll wire the whole house all by myself.  And she could.  And so, we trained an awful lot of people that nobody wanted.  And we built affordable housing, and we did this because we understood the materials that we were using.  We understood the labor that we had and we got the maximum out of both.  And so, therefore, the quality didn't suffer, but the cost was at a minimum.  And we won a design award for it, too.
Story_ID: 69091
Speaker 1: Now, other than your family, which I know you, you're extremely proud, proud of, what are you the most proud of in terms of a piece of architecture?
Speaker 2: A piece of architecture?
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: Again, I don't have a favorite piece of architecture.  I really don't.  Each one, each one of them have, has a special place in where I am and what I've done.  The McKnight Art Center at Wichita State [University, Wichita, Kansas], we sent the whole staff to class, to every class and then we came back, and we compared notes on how this was gonna go and through that whole process.  The rail station in Atlanta [Georgia], which was a tremendous challenge, because of where it was; where it was to be built; surroundings that were there; and the ones that were going to be there in the future, the challenge there in the station holds up extremely well in that environment.  The station that we did, the rail station we did in Miami [Florida], which is a Dr. Martin Luther King [Jr.] Plaza Station, it is a place where there's at least eight or ten acres out in front of it that has black stone walls that have words from Dr. King.  And every time I go there, I go see this place.  And it's like a, a almost a religious return for me to go do this, to read the words, to understand the context of what he said when he said it.  So every one of them that we do has that kind of a process.  So I don't really have any, I don't have any favorites.  My favorites now are quickly becoming the ones that my daughters do.
Story_ID: 69092
Speaker 1: What, what advice, speaking of young people, the younger people that are coming up behind you and, and those who are coming behind your daughters, I mean what advice would you give young people who may have the dream of being an architect?
Speaker 2: Just recently, a young lady just went, went to K-State [Kansas State University, Manhattan, Kansas] to school last week.  Her mother called me up first part of the summer, said, Mr. McAfee, said, do you sponsor students in architecture?  I said, sponsor?  What do you mean?  So my daughter is going to go to Kansas State.  She's been accepted and we really, we just really don't know much about this process.  I said, why don't the two of you come over and talk to me?  So they came over, they started to talk to me.  She started telling me about herself.  And I was sitting there and I was just smiling at her.  I said, you have a job?  She said yes.  I said, quit it, come to work for me--Monday.  She did.  Worked for me up until just the other day.  And every day, I was teaching, every day I was teaching.  I don't drink.  I don't smoke.  I surely don't do drugs.  I hate aspirin.  I only took pain pills (laughter) for a day and a half when we had that surgery.  But what I get high on are seeing young people of all colors do marvelous things.  I mean, I am so excited with Tiger Woods.  I am so excited with those two sisters [Serena and Venus Williams].  I mean I almost never miss an opportunity.  I never watch golf--I watch golf whenever Tiger's playing.  As much tennis as I used to play, I never used to watch women's tennis.  I don't watch men's tennis.  I watch women's tennis when Venus and Serena are playing.  When, at the Olympics, when we watched all those beautiful young girls win a gold medal in the various sports that they participated in, in Atlanta [Georgia], and especially the gymnastics, it was incredible.  Cheryl [McAfee-Mitchell] worked as part of the security thing after we had done all the Olympic projects.  And she called me on my cell phone and I was up in the stands at the gold medal basketball game.  And she said, daddy, don't leave your seat at half-time.  I said, why not?  She said, just don't leave, daddy.  And so, I didn't leave.  And out came the little golf cart--didn't see who was in at first.  It was Muhammad Ali and they gave him back his gold medal, you know.  And when you think about those things, when I was in high school, Jesse Owens came to our high school,  And you can just about imagine how all of us, black and white kids--Jesse Owens, you know.  And so, you, you, you look at those kinds of things and you, somehow, have a responsibility of passing on those legacies, passing on those moments to young people.  So when Carmen left the other day, I told Carmen, I said, Carmen, I want to tell you something.  You can do this.  You will be an architect, and don't you let anything get in your way.  I said, if you do, I'm going to come and spank you.  I mean it.  And I, and, and they're not the only ones.  There's always somebody that comes to us all the time.
Story_ID: 69093
Speaker 1: There was a young woman who came to us two or three years back--same kind of thing--mother, my daughter wants to be an architect.  Oh?  Well, she's already been accepted at K-State.  Oh?  Well, why don't you come up to the office and let's talk about it.  So, Mr. McAfee, we don't have the money to do this.  I said, well, come on over and let's talk.  And said that.  I said, well, it may be a little late for scholarships and stuff, I said, but let me see what I can do.  I turned around while they were sitting right there on that couch.  I turned around and made a phone call.  I said, brotherver, (ph.), I said, I got a marvelous young woman in my office--got like about a 3.9 average.  She's taking all the right courses--wants to go to K-State, be an architect.  They haven't offered her any money.  He said, you know, Modene (ph.) Archer.  She handles all those scholarships.  Modene's gone for about four or five days at a conference.  When she gets back, I will talk to her, and she'll call you.  So Modene called me--said when is the young woman coming?  I said, well, she comes up for freshman orientation next week.  Well, we'll do something.  Okay.  The child comes back.  Her mother calls me and says, my daughter got a full four ride--full five-year full ride scholarship.  I said, you're kidding?  Said no.  I said, what was the name of the scholarship?  The Veryl Switzer Scholarship (laughter)--Veryl Switzer.  You see, and this is why I say, you gotta pass this on.  If you don't pass it on, she would have never been here, but Veryl Switzer was a classmate of a guy at Kansas State who was the first baseball player, black, to play at Kansas State.  You know what his name was?  Earl Woods--
Speaker 2: Oh (laughter).
Speaker 1: --Tiger's daddy, okay.  Here we all were, out here in the Midwest, struggling like hell to go to class, to make the grades, to try to play where they didn't want you to play.  Okay.  But here's now the Veryl Switzer who's got a scholarship in his name--I didn't even know he had--that provides this child with a scholarship for the whole time she's in school.  Okay.  So he, if Kansas and Kansas State had been nicer to Earl Woods, maybe Tiger might have gone to K-State (laughter), you know.  If Kansas had been more gracious to Gordon Parks [HM], maybe Gordon's son and grandson would have gone to KU.
Story_ID: 69094
Speaker 1: Now this is an important point you're kinda making here and I, I don't want to be lost in.
Speaker 2: Uh-hum, uh-hum.
Speaker 1: And you said before we even started that there are many great people, African Americans, who were raised, born and raised here in Kansas--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --now successful in other places.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: They didn't get any support here or very little support here.
Speaker 2: Well, really, none.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: When, the first time Gordon [Parks, HM] came back here, he was going to make "The Learning Tree".  And MGM had sent all these people to Fort Scott [Kansas] and they--all the advance part and everything, and then Gordon showed up.  And the hotel that Gordon had filled with all the advance people and everything, were not going to let Gordon stay at this hotel (laughter).
Speaker 1: This was in the '70s [1970s] or early '70s [1970s], right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Were not going to let him stay at the hotel.  So, immediately, he was going to take the whole crew and go film this movie somewhere else but, of course, they decide to give him a private house out on the lake and whatever, whatever--make it all up to him.  You know, you know.  And it just keeps on going.  Even Jesse [Owens] went to school at Pittsburg State [University, Pittsburg, Kansas].  We've been trying to find their papers.  They're supposed to be at Pittsburg State.  Everybody tells us they don't have them.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Now that's here in Kansas--Pittsburg, Kansas, right?
Speaker 2: Pittsburg State University is right there on the eastern border of Kansas, Missouri.  When you look at George Brown [HM], graduate of KU [University of Kansas, Lawrence, Kansas] Journalism School--couldn't get a job in journalism on any newspaper in the state of Kansas and ends up going to Colorado, and becomes the first elected black lieutenant governor of Century Construction, and then vice president of Grumman, and on and on and on.  Lawrence Brown, who played the trombone for, for Duke Ellington in all those years, is a marvelous, marvelous entertainer.  Hattie McDaniel, you know, I already mentioned Hattie and, and Donald Hollowell live right over behind where now the, Black History Museum is.  The, the names that everybody knows, Barry Sanders, you know, but Barry Sanders' daddy and momma raised ten kids.  That man worked two or three jobs to raise ten kids in Wichita, Kansas.  But everybody knows about Barry Sanders running a football, but very few people know about William and Shirley Sanders.  Okay.  We have three generations of physicians in this town--the Brown family.  We have five generations of mortuary business in this town--the Jacksons.  And it just goes on and on and on.  Gordon and I always laugh about the song that says, "New York, New York, if you can do it in New York, you can do it anywhere".  No--if you can do in Kansas, you can do it anywhere, believe me.
Speaker 1: This is the place that they were escaping in the Oz books, right, they were escaping from Kansas?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --and they're from Kansas.
Speaker 2: I--the house I did, I, I was talking about out on a, on a private lake, there was a room that basically was designed as a tornado shelter.  But on the plans, I wouldn't call it that.  I called it the room for Dorothy and Toto (laughter) because Kansas doesn't have many tornados as seventeen other states.  One is too many if you're in the wrong place but, but, you know, sometimes you get a bad rap for, like not a lot of good things going on.  But like I said, we have some marvelous, marvelous young people who have grown up in this town, been educated in this town, who have shared the direction that I have benefitted from.  This was a town without a doubt.  I mean, when I was a bad little boy in Wichita, on the 3rd of July, we bought these brand new firecrackers.  And the--Charlie Gill (ph.) and I got these cherry bombs and boy, we were dropping down in the stairwell at the school.  Oh, they were making tremendous noise--boom!  And us, oh boy, let's drop another one.  But you weren't supposed to shoot firecrackers until after 6:00.  Around the corner came this big, tall man dressed in a police uniform.  His name was Lambert.  Mr. Lambert said, McAfee, Gill, I'm going to tell your fathers.  I was ready to say, Mr. Lambert, take me to jail.  Don't tell my daddy, you know.  I mean, if we did something down the block, Miss D. on her porch would say, boys, I'm calling your mothers, and that was the end of that.

Speaker 1: Sir, what, what are your hopes and concerns for the black community here in Wichita [Kansas] and elsewhere?
Speaker 2: Number one, that we stop the white flight.  Number two, that the economic level of black people in this country rises; that the political level takes on an honest face, as opposed to--the only way I get elected is I got to be all Catholic or all black, all Jewish, or all something else, that, as [Rev.] Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] said, it's about your talent.  It's never that yet, you know, I carry that speech around in my briefcase, but it's never there yet.  My hopes are that we finally figure out--this country and this world is so small that you learn how to treat people with dignity and respect.  And we make certain that whatever talent it is you have, you reflect in that talent that whole process.  It is a matter of whether or not if a young baby needs health care, I don't want to see a young mom and daddy go on TV begging, begging to raise money for this operation.  We go out and spend billions of dollars paving roads.  That's okay.  We need to pave the roads, but we also need to take care of people.  And that's where this whole thing breaks down from anything about socialism and about nothing.  It's about your kids and my kids, whether I know them or you know them.  It don't make any difference.  Nobody, nobody is smart enough to say that this little boy, this little girl will, will not be President of the United States.  Nobody is that smart.
Story_ID: 69096
Speaker 1: Sir, how, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: In my lifetime, the biggest goal I ever had was to be half the man my father [Arthur McAfee, Sr.] was.  My daddy was supposed to die when I was a baby.  He lived to be over eighty.  He was the most honest man I ever knew.  (Laughter).  I always used to say I wanted to be half the man, if I can just be half the man.  My father used to walk home.  He worked the split shift at the Union Station as a red cap.  And he used to walk home twice a day and walk back to work twice a day to save 10 cents.  I watched him one time at the Union Station, and they had this ramp that went up to the rail line.  And I watched him pick a bag up and put on this arm, pick another bag up and put it on this arm--four bags, and climb that ramp, that ramp (laughter).  I remember the time (laughter), the time when I tried to pick up four bags (laughter).  I couldn't even straighten up, let alone carry them.  But it was, it was that to me--that inspiration.  They inspired me so much with their honesty and their dignity and what they were and who they were.  I was in Los Angeles [California] that Christmas when I went out, and Richard Neutra was taking three students.  And I was included (unclear), two of them from Europe and myself to see these huge mansions that he'd done in Beverly Hills [California].  And it got dark.  And he said, let's just walk through here.  And we went through the shrubbery and came out on an Olympic-size swimming pool.  And we walked around the side of this elegant house.  And he said, look in there.  Here I am, peeping in a window in Beverly Hills, and I'm telling you, all I could think about was if my momma [Willie Anna McAfee] reads that I was arrested in Beverly Hills, peeping tom, she's going to kill me, you know.  So that's what it's all about.  It's like, when you read in Gordon Parks' [HM] book, "The Choice of Weapons", he was cold and hungry and he thought he was gonna rob the conductor.  And he saw his mother's face.
Speaker 1: It's the same thing.
Speaker 2: Same thing.  See, and, and, and if I can translate anything to my children or to young people around me, it is that, first of all, you must learn how to respect yourself.  And you surely have to respect your mother and father.  I don't care who they are or what they did, but you owe them something.
Story_ID: 69097
Speaker 1: I wanted to ask you, did your parents get a chance to see you become successful and, and, you know, what, what was their reaction to what you were doing?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, yeah, absolutely.  Over there on my desk is a, is a magnet.  And my father [Arthur McAfee, Sr.], in his late seventies, I would take him around on my construction jobs.  And one day, I noticed he reached in his pocket and he pulled out something.  And he was unraveling it and I thought, what is that?  He was unraveling a magnet on the end of a string, and he would go along and run it along the ground and pick up nails--put them in his pocket.  Those nails are still now at my mother's [Willie Anna McAfee] house--my sister, well, where my sister lives.  They still (unclear) him down there.  He could never understand why these people wasted all those nails.  And he would, he would go to, go places to me, you know, with me like that.  And momma was alive longer than he was.  And I mean, she kept every news article, everything, you know, and just, you know, extremely proud of, you know, what all of us had done, I mean, you know.  My sister [Gwen McAfee], my sister never failed to send money back to my mother and dad every month--didn't have to.  They didn't need it.  She did it, you know.  She would call them every morning before she left to go to work--every morning, you know.  That's just the way we've been blessed, and we're fortunate enough to be.  I mean, my brother [Arthur McAfee, Jr.], like I said, I mean I--I'm sort of like the family messenger.  I go to (unclear) and I see my brother, and I come back home and I see my sister, you know.  So it's--that's like, we're never really far apart from each other, and, you know, that sort of thing.  So it, it really has been that kind of inspiration from, you know, from my family, from my friends, from the neighborhood that, that I have really absorbed all of this.
Story_ID: 69098
Speaker 1: And you asked me about the two architects who inspired me the most. [Ludwig] Mies van der Rohe because of the quality of detailing in design and simplicity; Paul Williams, just because of the fact that he was an African American superhero--against all kinds of odds that no other architect ever had to go through--none.  But there's one little guy, a man by the name of Thornton Clark, who built that first house for me, and built many other things for me after that.  He died about two years ago now.
Speaker 2: He's a contractor basically then?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  He was the most skilled person I've ever met in my life.  There wasn't anything he couldn't do and he did it to perfection, whether it was carpentry or masonry or whatever.   He was just good at all of it.  And he went to a vocational school down in Louisiana and he was just really good.  And he would, he would, he would talk to me about don't waste that, don't waste this.  And I listened to him and I'd learn.  When I really did the modular processes, I did them based on what Clark taught me.  If you don't waste, you can build more for the same amount of money.  And so, I would watch him as he would lay out 2x4s or plywood or whatever, and there would be so little cutting that was necessary.  And I was absolutely amazed.  I'd go off and look at another house being built, and they were throwing away enough lumber and stuff out in the yard, you could build a whole another room.  It was never like that when Mr. Clark was doing something.  And so, it was really those three people that have sort of molded the technique that I live by at this point.  And, and, and when I said that (laughter), it was funny when I was asked this question in Chicago [Illinois].  And Mies van der Rohe's grandson, Dirk Lohan, was sitting right here.  And I said, the two people that inspired me the most were Mies van der Rohe and Thornton Clark, and everybody was trying to figure out who Thornton Clark was.  And then when I explained to them who Thornton Clark was, in the same momentum that I'd explained who Mies van der Rohe was, they were absolutely just dumbfounded that I could somehow put the two together.  See--but if Thornton Clark had, had the opportunity, he'd been better than Mies 'cause Thornton really understood material, you know, he really--  Mies made it to fit what he wanted it to be.  Clark took it and made it into something.  See, and so, it, it's a, it's a marvelous lesson that I learned and I don't care who it is you work for, what is you do, if you work on a job that you don't like, you learn what not to do.  If you work on a job that you, that you like, you learn how to remind yourself that, that was the good part, and that other place is the bad part.  And so you know the difference in what you should do and what you shouldn't do.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And so, that's the, the sort of skill that I think all of us have to live in whatever profession we're in, whatever job we're in.  You know, my father was the best red cap that ever lived--the absolute best.  There's no doubt in my mind about it, but he could have been the best doctor that ever lived.  See, so it wasn't about that.  It was just the way the cards were dealt at the time.
Story_ID: 69099
Speaker 1: Sir, I know you're still working and have a lot more to do, but what would you see as your legacy?
Speaker 2: In architecture, my legacy basically is that I'm never going to start fighting to do quality affordable housing.  I am never going to stop doing that.  I don't care what other kind of projects I design or whatever kind of contracts I have, I will never stop trying to find that process and that success.  In other words, I gotta do what Henry Ford did for the automobile.  I gotta find the way how to deliver a product that everybody can afford.  Now I have the way.  The problem is, is having the access to the capital in this country to get it done.  But I have the way.
Story_ID: 69100
Speaker 1: That's the modular.
Speaker 2: The modular system [McAfee Modular Systems].  I definitely have the way.  There's no, there's no doubt about that.  It's won all kinds of awards--all kinds of everything.  Nobody proved that I don't have the way, but the factors that are there, working a non-union shop.  Well, I didn't work a non-union shop.  I worked a union shop, but they wouldn't negotiate with me fairly the next time around.  Financing from Nations Bank, from Bank of America.  It doesn't exist.  They will tell you that we're going to invest millions of dollars in minority and poor communities.  It's a lie.  It's an absolute lie in this country.  Okay.  In Mexico one time, I was on a tour bus, and the tour guide was pointing out a thing he called a house--a thatched roof, reeds for walls, no door, no windows in the holes.  And he was saying that the natives love to live in places like that because it allows the breeze to blow through.  I interrupted him, I said, don't do that.  I said it also allows, allows the flies and the ants and the mosquitos, so don't do that.  They live there because that's all they can afford.  And that's ridiculous.  And one day, that same trip, we pull up into a little town.  And there was this wire, I noticed, going from little house to little house.  Now what is that?  It was an electric wire.  And we got close enough to one of these houses and the window less opening, and I could look in and see on a dirt floor, on a concrete block, was a little bitty colored TV.  You know what they can pick up--all the satellite, CNN, and a whole bunch of other stuff.  Now if you were a poor little Mexican boy, where would you head for?  You wouldn't stay over there on that dirt floor, would you?  Okay.  So what are we doing?  I mean, this doesn't make sense, you know.  It is about being fair.  It is about making opportunity out there for everybody.  That's what it's about.  And, and, and to me, my architecture basically says that.  That's what I do.  I don't care how much money you got as a client.  That is not important to me.  If we can get this job finished in a quality way, that somehow, that somehow, either on purpose or by accident, creates an environment that helps someone grow a better life, and that's what this is all about.  It is not about my ego.  I can stand up in front of some building I did, you know, and feel like how great I am.  If I don't know how good I am, I don't know what I'm doing anyway.  It's all luck.  Okay.  But what it's really all about is to make certain that you create an environment that allows other people to be motivated to be successful.  If I look at all the little kids that I see struggling all over every place and I don't pay any attention to them, there is something really wrong with me, really wrong.  When you get old enough to be able to draw on the experiences that you have--Mike Wallace, once in-, interviewed Frank Lloyd Wright, who he asked Wright, he said, Mr. Wright, he said, you've been designing outstanding buildings or something to that effect for a long time.  He says, how do you do it?  He said, I just shake it out of my sleeve.  What he meant was, I've been doing this so long, this, this is no big deal.  I know who I am.  I know what talent I've got, and I know where I'm going.  It is only a matter of having the vehicle to get there.  Okay.  The other thing that I want to be remembered for--Gloria's husband; Cheryl, Pam, and Charyl's daddy.  Okay.
Speaker 1: All right.  Thank you very much, sir.
Speaker 2: You're welcome, my pleasure.
Story_ID: 69101
Speaker 1: This is a picture of two of the most favorite things in my life--my '71 [1971] Mustang, which I still have in my garage, and my big puppy named Bushy (ph.), my Japanese Akita male.  Bushy and I were the only two males in our house.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right, and--
Speaker 1: This is a photograph of my father, Arthur McAfee [Sr.], my hero, my daddy.  He's a marvelous man, the most honest man I've ever known in my life.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: Okay.  This is my dear friend, Gordon Parks [HM], on the occasion of him getting the key to the city of New York [New York] for the second year in a row.
Speaker 1: Great, what year, do you know?
Speaker 2: Oh, boy, I don't know exactly but it was about, it was about ten years ago, ten, twelve years go.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: This is my friend, Herman Cain, a graduate of Morehouse College [Atlanta, Georgia] who I like to refer to as "The Godfather".  He is the principal owner of Godfather's Pizza.
Speaker 1: And how does he spell his last name?
Speaker 2: Cain, C-A-I-N.
Speaker 1: Okay, good, next.
Speaker 2: And this is my dear friend and fraternity brother, George Brown.  I was fortunate enough to introduce him at a national convention in Las Vegas [Nevada].  His secretary sent me a four-page resume, and he said to me, don't read all that stuff.  It's too much.  I said okay.  I went up in my room and I speed read it.  I speed read and I kept reading it, and kept reading it.  I got it down to less than two minutes.  I read the whole thing.  He stood up and he said, and to my former friend, Charles McAfee (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, next.
Speaker 2: This is at the White House during the Nixon Administration--Robert Brown, who is a special assistant to the President [Richard Nixon]; and Ed Sexton, who was a very dear friend of all of ours; and the little man in the middle, who was the Mayor of Cotton Plant, Arkansas.
Speaker 1: Okay, next, please.  Which photo, Larry?
Speaker 2: Well-- Okay, we'll start with the blond, the vertical one on the left.
Speaker 1: Okay.  This is Mayor Andrew Young cutting a pizza on our opening day for our pizza franchise, delivery franchise, in the city of Atlanta [Georgia] while he was Mayor of Atlanta.  We also did Andy's personal residence in Atlanta also.
Speaker 2: And then, go up to the ribbon cutting.
Speaker 1: The ribbon cutting, you see the mayor and a city councilman and the manager of our pizza units and yours truly.
Speaker 2: Okay, next, please.
Speaker 1: This is in Washington, D.C., a photograph of A. Price Witter, Jr. on the right--goes up a little higher, I'm sorry.  This is a photograph in Washington, D.C. of A. Price Woodard, Jr., the first and only African American mayor in the history of the city of Wichita [Kansas]; Garnis Robber (ph.), who was a congressman from this region at that time and me at the--on the Capitol steps on one of the occasions when--I believe that was the time we went back and brought back between $9 and $10 million in federal grants for the city of Wichita.
Speaker 2: Go ahead, next.
Speaker 1: This is on the occasion of the National Business League's National Convention in Wichita--Sherman Copelin, the National President on the left; Val Jackson [Abner Jean "Val" Jackson, HM] from Jackson Mortuary in, in, in the middle; Frangel (ph.) Barrett (ph.), the head of the Center for Entrepreneurship at Wichita State [University, Wichita, Kansas]; and yours truly.  And in the background is a painting of Sherman Copelin done by a local artist here in town that does an awful lot of work for us, and his name is John Allen.
Speaker 2: Okay, next.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: This is a very special photograph for me.  The two young ladies were both born in Wichita.  And the two men happen to be their fathers on the occasion of both of us receiving our fellowship medals from the American Institute of Architects in Minneapolis [Minnesota].  Both of those young ladies are architects and it was just a very proud day.
Speaker 1: Do you remember what year that took place?
Speaker 2: 1981.
Speaker 1: Right.  Okay, next, okay, go ahead.
Speaker 2: This is a photograph of the other Jackson twin that you saw before.  This is Anderson Eugene "Gene" Jackson [HM], along with another reasonably well-known Jackson named Jesse [Rev. Jesse L. Jackson, Sr.], and yours truly again.  It's on the occasion at a speech he gave at Kansas State University.
Speaker 1: Next, please.
Speaker 2: This is of my dear friend, the Governor of, the former Governor of Virginia, Doug Wilder, on the occasion--actually, of a, of a speech at Kansas State University also, the Landon Lecture Series.
Speaker 1: Okay, next, okay.
Speaker 2: This is a photo of a very famous architect, I.M. Pei, a very, very talented person.  And it turned out that when my oldest daughter, Cheryl [McAfee-Mitchell], was elected to the Harvard Board of Directors, the mentor that she had as a past president of Harvard Alumni, was his son.  So generations do keep going.
Speaker 1: What year do you suppose this was?
Speaker 2: This, year this was?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: This was 1964.
Speaker 1: Okay.  This was actually when you were just about getting the award.
Speaker 2: At the awards ceremony, right.
Speaker 1: Okay, great, thanks, next.
Story_ID: 69102
Speaker 1: This is also at the FHA [Federal Housing Administration] Awards Ceremony.  This is Dr. Robert C. Weaver, a talented educator who became the first African American to serve in a Presidential Cabinet.  He was the Secretary of the newly created Department of Housing and Urban Development [HUD].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: This is a picture of my wife and I receiving the award from Mr. [Philip A.] Brownstein who was the head of FHA at that time in Washington, D.C.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: Okay, ready for the next one.  All right (unclear).
Speaker 2: This was at the end of my freshman year at University of Nebraska [Lincoln, Nebraska].  And the two guys I'm flight bound on either side are the Jackson twins, Val [Abner Jean "Val" Jackson, HM] on the left and Genie [Anderson Eugene "Genie" Jackson, HM] on the right.
Speaker 1: Oh, you all have been together a long time (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Oh, we were together long before that (laughter), long before that.  This was when they used to have the cameras down, you know, on the street and they'd take pictures of you.
Speaker 1: Uh-hum.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Next in line.
Speaker 2: Okay, go ahead.
Speaker 1: This is a picture at the Democratic Convention in Atlanta [Georgia].  On the left side is Congressman Jim Slattery from Kansas at that time, and my daughter, Cheryl [McAfee-Mitchell].  Cheryl and I were holding the distinction of the only father, daughter, delegate combination at the convention.
Speaker 2: Okay, next, okay.
Speaker 1: These are two of our three marvelous daughters.  The one on the left is Cheryl.  The one on the right is Charyl.  And they really do know what they're doing.  They don't just look like they know what they're doing.
Speaker 2: What year was this taken?
Speaker 1: This would have been taken--let's see, about 19-, this would have been taken about 1990.
Speaker 2: All right, next, please.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Way, way back, this was a photograph in the high school album and they even spelled the word, "archie-tect", so but that's what I used to look like in high school.
Speaker 1: Okay, hold on a minute (unclear).
Speaker 2: What year is this (unclear)?
Speaker 1: Which year?  That happened to be 1949, spring 1950 at the latest.
Speaker 2: Okay (unclear), okay, next.
Speaker 1: It's my marvelous mommy [Willie Anna McAfee].  This photograph was taken on the occasion--the newspaper had been doing stories, and the police department had improperly named the neighborhood crack alley.  I was so offended that the newspaper came out and did a story of at least three families, Marvin Stone and his family; Curtis McClinton, whose father was the first African American senator, state senator in the state of Kansas; and Curtis is an All-American football player from the University of Kansas [Manhattan, Kansas], and played for the Kansas City Chiefs.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: So there were a lot of us that resented the neighborhood being mislabeled.
Speaker 2: Sure.  And what, what year was this?
Speaker 1: It's right on that newspaper right there.
Speaker 2: Just say into the microphone December 1989.
Speaker 1: December 1989.
Speaker 2: Okay, good, next.
Speaker 1: This is a picture shortly after Cheryl graduated from Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] and had returned here to work--after her grandmother convinced her that's what she needed to do (laughter).
Speaker 2: Okay, next, please.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: That, that one or the one--that's--and this is my daughter, Pamela, who is so talented, who her father continues to try to recruit her to come into the architectural firm.  What you see her holding is a flower display.  She has a company called The Flower Room that does silk floral arrangements, but she has a Master's degree in public administration and is presently working in the medical field as a, as a medical administrator.
Speaker 1: Okay, next.
Speaker 2: The next photograph is in the house basically that I grew up in--my sister still lives in.  The picture shows my daddy [Arthur McAfee, Sr.], my momma [Willie Anna McAfee], and my little grandpa whose name is Charles Francis Brown.  That's who I was named after.  And the two big puppies, my daddy is holding the little mean one.  That's why he's on a leash.  His name was Rex.  He was a red chow, scared of nothing--invincible.  And the beautiful little girl is--her name is Tara.  She's a red Irish setter.  This is at 933 Indiana in Wichita, Kansas.
