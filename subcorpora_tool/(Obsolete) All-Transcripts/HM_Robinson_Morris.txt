Speaker 1: Okay, and what is your date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: I was born January 20th, 1945, in Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 1: Okay, and Sir, what is your occupation?
Speaker 2: Currently I am the economic development planner for the City of Evanston [Illinois].
Speaker 1: All right, and what is today's date?
Speaker 2: Today is August 20th, 2003.  I'm, I'm pretty sure it's two thou--eighth--the twentieth (laughter).
Speaker 1: And where are we at the present time, and don't give your address, just--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: We're in Evanston, Illinois, which is a, on the northern border of Chicago.
Speaker 1: In your home, right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 177426
Speaker 1: All right, before we go into depth, there are five lightweight People magazine-ish type questions that we are compelled to ask you.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And they just require a short answer.  The first one is, sir, what is your favorite food?
Speaker 2: Italian--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and any particular Italian, are you interested in?  I just like Italian cuisine.
Speaker 1: Okay, now do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Yes, navy blue.
Speaker 1: All right, do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: The whole year (laughter), but I guess I, I prefer warmer weather because it allows me to do the things I, I like to do most.
Speaker 1: All right, now do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Several, but yes, I, I suppose you only want one answer.  Currently, it's, it's Florida.
Speaker 1: Okay, and do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Yes, and it's not mine.  I can't take credit for it, but it's to be rather than to seem.
Speaker 1: Okay, now who's, who's is that?
Speaker 2: This was a, a, a wealthy magnate of the turn of the century by the name of [Henry] Graves, and I can't remember his first name now.  But I know it struck home with me because I'd rather actually something, whatever that may be, than to give the appearance of being something and it's not really the case.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 177427
Speaker 1: Let me ask you about your family history, you know.  I want you to tell me as much as you can about your mother's side and your father's side.  And I'll start with your mother's side.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Her full name is Emma; her maiden name was Scarborough, S-C-A-R-B-O-R-O-U-G-H, and her last name is Robinson.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And what is the date and place of her birth?
Speaker 2: Oh, boy, you get me now.  She's eighty-nine years old.  She was born in, in Little Rock, Arkansas, eighty-nine years ago (laughter).  My wife would know.  I can't, so I can't call her in here, can I?
Speaker 1: No, that's all right.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: That's all right.
Speaker 2: All right, okay.
Speaker 1: She, she, she at eighty-nine now.
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: All right, okay.
Speaker 2: My father is deceased.  He died in about, eight years ago.
Speaker 1: Okay, well, I'm gonna ask you about him, but I wanted to--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --ask about your mother's side first.  So what can you tell us about your mother's side of the family?  How far back can you go?
Speaker 2: We can go back quite a bit.  My mother's parents were killed in a car accident when she was very young.  Her mother's name was Piety [ph.].  And I for, I forget what my grandfather's name was because I can't at the moment--I mean I can get it.
Speaker 1: Her name is--
Speaker 2: But she was raised by her grandfather, my great-grandfather, who had a large farm in Arkansas.
Story_ID: 177428
Speaker 1: I was asking you about your family tree on your mother's [Emma Scarborough Robinson] side.  You know, what can you tell us about--are there, there any stories handed down from that side of the family about your--
Speaker 2: Well, I can't say much about my grandparents on my mother's side because, as I said, they were killed at a very early age, and she was raised by my, my great-grandfather.  And his name was Caesar Parker [ph.].  And from the stories that we have been told by my mother is that he was one of the largest farmers in this area of Arkansas, Little Rock, or in Little Rock.  And then (laughter), when he died there was an article in the local paper saying, "Exemplary darkie dies who was very benevolent" and--because he, he fed white and black alike off of his farm during the [Great] Depression.  And, and they knew, they, the, the people knew that if they were down and out, they could always go to the Parker farm and get food and assistance from my, from my great-grandfather.  And I think that sets an excellent example for, for his descendants.  So, I never had the opportunity to meet him.  He died before I was born.  But my mother, who was raised by him, still speaks lovingly of him.  And I recently found a picture of him, and it was in very bad condition.  And I took it to a specialist that I knew, who restored it, and I had it blown up and gave it to my mother on her eighty-eighth birthday and she cried.  She said that's exactly the way he looked.  And I was glad they were able to do that.  But he, he was the inspiration for my mother who, when they moved to Chicago [Illinois]--actually my dad [Earl Robinson] came first, which was the normal pattern I guess during the early migration days from the South in the Depression.  She, she was very reluctant to leave her, her grandfather, but--
Speaker 1: Now, now was she, was she raised--when, she was raised in Arkansas, did, did she go to college there or--
Speaker 2: No, no--
Speaker 1: --did she have a chance--
Speaker 2: --no, no, no--
Speaker 1: --to go to school?
Speaker 2: No, no, she went to school, but she didn't go to college.  But she had opportunities to go, but she married rather young--I think she was eighteen--and moved to Chicago.
Story_ID: 177429
Speaker 1: Now how did she [Robinson's mother, Emma Scarborough Robinson] meet your father [Earl Robinson] (unclear)--
Speaker 2: They, actually they were childhood friends, and in fact, she tells the story that if anyone had ever said that she'd marry that little Robinson boy with the shoes that turned up in the front, she would have slapped 'em.  She not in, (laughter) not on your life.  But--and she said my father was extremely, extremely mischievous.  That may be the word they used then, but he sounded like he was a, a punk (laughter) to me.  And he was a small man, and--but wouldn't back down from anybody.  And if he couldn't beat you, he, he had a very accurate eye and an arm.  And he'd pick up a rock and could hit the, hit a snake from a hundred yards, I understand.  But he had a little--he and his brothers had the little reputations of being some pretty bad actors in the, in the community.  So, when she said that if people had said she'd marry him, she would have called them a liar in a moment.  But they had a very long married life together.  We celebrated--they lived long--he lived long enough to celebrate his fiftieth anni--wedding anniversary with all of the children and grandchildren and so forth.
Story_ID: 177430
Speaker 1: What's your father's full name?
Speaker 2: His name is Earl.  I'm, my, my middle initial is named after--for him, Earl E. Robinson.
Speaker 1: All right and what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: He was, he would have been eighty-nine years old too.  He was born in Little Rock, Arkansas, also.  He would have been eighty-nine years old too.  He and my mother [Emma Scarborough Robinson] were the same age.  In fact, my mother was maybe a month or two older than him.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And they came to--they first, if I remember correctly, they first moved to Missouri 'cause I think he had family there.  During the [Great] Depression there was a lot of shifting around.  And then they migrated to Chicago [Illinois] in the early '40s [1940s].
Speaker 1: Now, now I wanted to ask you about his side of the family.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: You know, how--what do you know about his side of the family?  How far--
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: --back can you trace them?
Speaker 2: I can take it all the way back as far as at least my, my mother's side.  And I have cheat a little bit--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --if you don't mind.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: I, I, I knew my grandmother well, his, his mother.  I never met my grandfather.  He had died.  But we can take it back all the way to--my, my grandmother was a Spencer before she married Robinson.  And we can take these and, and the Spencer and Simpkins family, we can take it back probably to the turn of the 19th century.  So, the word is that, I don't know if you're familiar with it or not, but Morocco and other Arab countries were very active in the slave trade.
Speaker 1: I'm sorry?
Speaker 2: Active in the slave trade, you know.
Speaker 1: Who now?  I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: Morocco and--
Speaker 1: Morocco, okay.
Speaker 2: --Morocco and various other Mideastern countries.
Speaker 1: Right--
Speaker 2: And--
Speaker 1: --a lot of Muslims were active, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, right, absolutely.  And we know that my, on my father's side, his great-great-grandmother via some part of Africa, but originally came out of Morocco, maybe because that, during the days when they just told the stories, that's where she remembers that she was--because she was obviously very young.  So I would, I presume that she was probably from some part of Eastern Africa maybe, but found her way through Morocco for some reason or another.  And her name was, I'm gonna say Josephine was her name, Josephine Simpkins [ph.].  She probably took a slave name Simpkins, but that's--we haven't really dug that far back.  And we're, right now we're going from, from whatever written records we have and that these stories told by the older members of the family, so.  My son, who is an archivist and historian and what have you, is doing most of the work.  I started it for him, but he's done some tremendous work.  In fact, this chart is now obsolete, because he's been able to go back even further.  It becomes more of a daunting task when you got--now he's got two sides of the families trying to the same thing for it too, and it, it's, it's something you do when that's all you have to do.  So when I, when I retire, I think I'll get, get more involved with, with things of that nature.  So, the only grandparent that I knew growing up, the only surviving grandparent, was my grandmother on my father's side.  We used to call her Mother Lena [ph.].  Her name was Lena, Lena Robinson.
Story_ID: 177431
Speaker 1: Okay, now did she [Robinson's grandmother, Lena Robinson (ph.)] tell stories about family history in Arkansas?  I mean--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: --how did they get to Arkansas, and she--
Speaker 2: Well, well, ultimately, it was vi--via South Carolina, but that goes--I mean that's early in the 1800s.  But what was very interesting about my, my father [Earl Robinson] and his brothers, he had four brothers and two sisters, and all of them could sing very well.  So they formed a church singing group, just the boys did, the Robinson boys, and they sung all over the South.  And my father sang lead.  My father had eight children.  Not one of us can sing or hold a note (laughter), but he was a marvelous singer.  They, and they would get together.  And my youngest uncle, his name--we used to call him Bud [ph.].  He sang bass.  My father was more or less a tenor.  And Uncle Tommy [ph.] was a, was a baritone.  And my Uncle Jim [ph.] was more of a, of an alto.  But they could sing.  I mean they could rock a church.  So, we, we, we, we keep saying that maybe there is gonna be a generation that comes along.  Maybe my granddaughter will get that trade of being able to sing.  But they, they could--it was just a pleasure growing up.  And of course, when we were little, like most black families, you went to church on Sunday, whether you liked it or not.  And believe me, I didn't like it, but I did enjoy it when my father and his brothers would, would get together at a reunion, and visit the church, and, and sing.  That was, that's a very pleasant memory to have.  The brothers were spread out.  My Uncle Tommy, he, he migrated to St. Louis, Missouri.  And the other brothers, they were here, but they started dying off, so.  But you know, the Robinson boys were well known in that part of the South.
Story_ID: 177432
Speaker 1: Now what did your father [Earl Robinson] do for a living?
Speaker 2: My father was a factory foreman.  And that's--he worked nights all his life.  I don't ever remember him having a day job.  So, you know, we grew up with, "Don't wake your father up.  He's sleep."  My mother [Emma Scarborough Robinson] didn't work.  She was, unfortunately, she contracted cancer and other maladies that beset people.  But--and we'd see him on the weekend primarily, because when we did see him, he'd be getting up, and my mother would have an early dinner for him until when he'd be going to work.  But he was a, like I said, he was a little man.  I don't think he ever weighed more than 130 pounds in his life.  But he was a big man in, in my eyes, and he really set some values that we treasure today.  I, I have many, many pleasant memories.  We're, our family was always intact.  My dad--we always had a house.  My dad bought us a house, you know, to live in and so forth.  And we were, we were all taken care of.  So, I think that's the true measure of a man and, and, and a father.
Story_ID: 177433
Speaker 1: First of all, is there a story as to why your father [Earl Robinson] and mother [Emma Scarborough Robinson] left Arkansas?  I mean--
Speaker 2: Oh yes, it--
Speaker 1: --it might--you might think it's obvious, you know--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --with people trying to get out of the South.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: But, but is there a reason, a specific reason?
Speaker 2: Primarily, my mother first of all hated the South.  And, and to this day, I hate to say it, she still hates the South.  And the only reason that she would ever go back, and has gone back, is to visit family.  But she can't wait to get away from there.  But primarily, it was the [Great] Depression that, that, when they were young married, it was hard trying to find a living there.  And of, of course, the North offered more opportunities.  So, that's exactly why they left, which is probably a story that's repeated a million times.  And if you look at the pattern of migration from the South, those African Americans, those black folks who lived more centrally south, the shortest route up was--and to the north was Chicago--the more eastern you were, you probably went to places like New York or Philadelphia or whatever.  But then we also had the train line that, that took you directly to the South Side over here that--and, and so, it was by luck of the draw, depending on where you were where you wound up at, and Chicago was, was the place.  I'm trying to remember if we had any relatives here.  And I--maybe my father's sisters, or one of his sisters, Lillian [ph.], moved up here first.  And, and having that kind of contact, probably is the reason why that when the farms were failing, you know, that sort of thing, young, you know, married people with children like my, like my mother and father felt that it was probably the best move to make.  Unlike my wife [Margie Robinson], who is a third generation Illinoisan (laughter), you know, so she--and yet, both her parents now have moved South to retire (laughter).  So it shows that nothing stays the same.  In fact, I think there's a reverse migration going on right now.
Story_ID: 177434
Speaker 1: Now, now what's your earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: My earliest childhood memory well--up until I was, I gonna say, twelve or thirteen, for some reason, we never lived in a black community.  We always lived in a white community, and usually it was a white working class community.  In fact, my formative years were, were in one place, right off Division [Street, Chicago, Illinois] on a street called Honore [Street, Chicago, Illinois].  And I went to a school, as most of my siblings did, Hans Christian Andersen [Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois] and then from there to Wells.  Now that area now is all Latino, but when we lived there, it was basically Eastern European.
Speaker 1: Now what factory did your father [Earl Robinson] work for?
Speaker 2: Oh, I can't remember now.
Speaker 1: You can't, okay.
Speaker 2: I can't remember now.  I, I really can't.  I mean--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --I, I don't wanna say without knowing.
Speaker 1: What kind of factory was it then?
Speaker 2: In manufacturing.  I think for some reason I wanna say mattresses, okay, but I'm not quite sure anymore.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Because that was so many, many years ago, and it never--you know, and he's been retired for--before he died he was retired already for, I'm gonna say a good dozen years or more, so.  I, I mean it just never dawned on me to, to really remember that.  But, but getting back to your question, (unclear) some of my memories, I, I remember being the only black kid in my classes, as my sisters and brothers could say too.  My oldest brother, who's deceased, left a brilliant track record in those schools.  He was absolutely brilliant.  There's no other way to say it, and the teachers remem--and so, whenever another Robinson kid came through that class, we were always held up to that standard that my brother set.
Story_ID: 177435
Speaker 1: Now, now how many brothers and sisters do you have, and can you name 'em for us?
Speaker 2: I have, I have four brothers--I'm sorry, I have three brothers.  One is deceased.  Phil is the oldest, Phil Robinson [ph.].  The next oldest brother is James Robinson [ph.], then there's me, Morris Robinson, and my youngest brother, he's Jackie Robinson [ph.], named after the, the, the baseball player.  My sisters are: Julie [ph.], who is the oldest, Mickey [ph.], who's the next oldest, Lois [ph.], Pat [ph.], and Renee [ph.], Renee being the baby.  She--and we're kind of, we're kind of spread out over many, many, many years.  My youngest sibling is forty, my oldest is seventy, so it's, we're spread out.  So when I was growing up, by the time I became a teenager, I was the oldest person in the house.  So it was almost like we grew up in shifts, because as the older ones went to college and moved out, you didn't really grow up with them.  And--but I had plenty of older sisters and brothers.  And, and I used to have to fight a bit.  I was a fighter.  I mean I didn't let you get the "N" word out your mouth too fast.  But that quickly ended.  Believe it or not, in the early stages there was some of that, but after a while, that kind of disappeared.
Story_ID: 177436
Speaker 1: Yeah, now what was--before we get into school too, too deep, what, what are some of the sights, and sounds, and smells of, of your household and growing up?
Speaker 2: Oh, I could tell you we went to bed every night to the strain--there was a Polish tavern on the corner, and we went to bed every night with the smell of, of sauerkraut and, and, and beer, and bratwurst, and, and polka music.
Story_ID: 177437
Speaker 1: I can remember going to sleep every night, 'cause in those days there was no air conditioning; your windows were open, and the Polish music would be coming in, and the sounds of good times over there.  I got so used to it, you know, you ignore it.  And we used to have the most, the greatest Halloweens over there because along Milwaukee Avenue there were nothing but storefront shops of all different kinds.  And, and we'd go trick-a-treating, and when we got home, we'd find in our bags not just fruit and whatever, we'd find meat (laughter), we'd find bratwurst, we'd find cheeses, we'd find all that kind of stuff.  And I think if you look at it from a practical sense, these were immigrants from Europe who had just gone through the war [World War II, WWII].  And they knew hunger, and they knew all kinds of depravations.  And one of the greatest gifts you could give anybody in a situation like that would be food.  And then sometimes you'd find at the bottom of your bag pennies and what have you.  Halloweens were a lot of fun.  My kids never liked it, but growing up in that area was a lot of fun.
Speaker 2: Okay, any, any other sights, and sounds, and smells of growing up?
Speaker 1: Well, the interesting thing is when I went to--when I was--when, when my parents [Emma Scarborough Robinson and Earl Robinson] moved from the North Side and bought a house on the West Side, I went to a, my first black school.  And I was told, although I didn't know it, I talked funny.  And here again, I said all over again, I had to fight almost every day.  But you learn how to finally get the vernacular and get that down.  But I was told so many times, "You sound like you're white.  I'm gonna--I don't like you."  And after school I knew I had--but fortunately in those days that's all, was a scrap, you know.  I just got to the point where I knew that after school there was gonna be somebody that, that was gonna confront me.  Now, that only lasted for a little while too, because once they found out that you would scrap back with them, they would leave you alone.  So I must have gotten that trait from my, from my father.  But I tell you, when I did finally get in a black environment, I ate black history up.  I mean I just couldn't get--I had never heard the, the anthem, 'Lift Every Voice and Sing' until I was a teenager.  The, the only thing that I ever read black in the grammar schools that I went to was 'Little Black Sambo.'  As far as any black heroes or, or famous people, whatever, the only way I got that was from my parents and my sisters and brothers.  But they weren't in the schools books, and they weren't--in fact, I, I became, I guess you could say I was a militant in the '60s [1960s], and you know, with the afro and the whole works, and pledged my fraternity and became even more militant (laughter).  That was signs of the times, you know.
Story_ID: 177438
Speaker 1: Let me take, take you back to grade school now.  What did grade school did you attend?
Speaker 2: I went to Hans Christian Andersen [Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois]--
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: --which is on Division [Street, Chicago, Illinois].  And I would imagine it's about--I wouldn't know just how far west.  I know it was east of California [Street, Chicago, Illinois].  And I can't remember now what the cross street--it was at Division and Honore [Street, Chicago, Illinois], but I can't remember what hundred block of Division that is.
Speaker 1: Now, now were you the only black student in class?
Speaker 2: Well, I had sisters and brothers in--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --but in my class I was, because we're in different classes.
Speaker 1: Were you, were you the only black family in the school?
Speaker 2: We--there was one other.  We lived--they lived down the block from us.  But--and act--actually, there was one that lived in our building.  And his, the son, his name was Leroy [ph.], was one of our good buddies.  And there other black families, but their kids were younger than we were.  But yeah, basically, we were, were it.  And it's not, it's not been an unusual thing for me in my lifetime, in my life where that has been the case in many instances.  And I'm not gonna get into this first to do this.  I don't, I don't buy that.  I'm just saying that I found myself in that predicament in many instances in the route my life took me, so.
Speaker 1: Okay, but how--
Speaker 2: But it started as a young person.
Speaker 1: Well, how did you like school when you started?
Speaker 2: Oh, I loved it.  I loved it.  You--I can remember one incident, and I don't know if this was stereotypical or not, because I had older sisters and brothers, I could read before I started school.  My oldest brother, whom I, I just idolized--back in those days they used to make these Marvel comic books.  They were that thick, the Christmas editions.  You're probably too young to remember this.  But we looked forward to 'em, and as we--he--we'd be reading 'em, the older sisters and brothers would teach you how to read.  So when I started grammar school, when I--after kindergarten and going into first grade, I didn't in saying I could read or whatever, but they just assumed that I probably was a slow learner or whatever.  I, I mean the kids were not empowered, at least they weren't raised to, to say anything, so you--in those days they took you, the kids, and sat you in various groups, the slowest learners, the fastest learners.  And, and the (unclear) at the time was 'Dick and Jane.'  I don't know if that rings a bell with you--"See spot run." "See Dick..."  And finally this teacher got around to calling on me to read, and I just blew right through it, you know.  And she immediately walked over to this group.  "What is this kid doing over here?"  And you know, put me in, in the group.  "And why didn't you didn't you tell us you could read?"  I said, "Because no one ever asked me read," you know.  But my--I have a, an older sister, Lois right now, who is, is--had a brain aneurism so she's, she's an invalid now.  But I think in her lifetime, if I had to guess how many books she's read, it'd have to be in the thousands.  I mean she is a voracious reader, and, and the whole family was like that.  And I can't imagine what a household is like without books.  And I think that's why I gravitated to history myself.  But I can think of instances like that through school that the assumption is made before they know who you are.  And I hope that those kinds of evaluations are, are no longer existing in schools.  I know when I was going to school there and I said I wanted to be something, there were never any negative things about you can't do that.  I didn't run into that until I started going to the black schools.  And I think that's all because of the environment, you know.  You had teachers, black teachers, who knew what the obstacles were for them and knew what the real world was like that was out there.  So if you said you wanted to be something that most blacks or, or many blacks did not become, we, we had too many teachers saying you can't do that, rather than saying go for it; you can be whatever you want to against all odds.  That's changed, but we're talking, you know, forty, fifty years ago.  I'm fifty-eight years old now, so we're talking a long time ago.  And I'm glad that has changed.  I think that kids, regardless of who they are, what color they are, what their background is, if they have the tenacity and the brainpower and whatever, they can be what they, what they wanna be.  So, I never ran into that in, in, until I got into the black schools for some reason.  And I got lazy when I went to the black schools because I think that the, the problems were so overwhelming that teachers had to face.  The difference was really apparent.
Story_ID: 176277
Speaker 1: Now you went to Hans Christian Andersen [Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois].  You went to Alfred Lord Tennyson [Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois]--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --grade school, and that was an all-black school.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: You said that they would kind of discourage, they were, they were discouraging there in terms of--
Speaker 2: Well, not--I wouldn't say they.  I would say some teachers when I--and, and I'm not necessarily gonna let--because I had some really fine teachers at Tennyson, who, who, who were the old school teachers who know that if, if you worked hard and push, you could do something.
Speaker 1: Now who, who, who were some of the teachers?  Can you remember them?
Speaker 2: Mrs. Lewis [ph.], Mrs. Schuman [ph.].  You asking me to go pretty far back now, ah geez, Mr. Smith [ph.]--I know that sounds funny, but that was his name, tall, thought he was the tallest person I'd ever seen in my life.  And he was also an Alpha by the way, which was a fraternity [Alpha Phi Alphi Fraternity].  And, and at the time, you know, you, you start learning these things as you get involved.  And I said I wanna be just like him one day.  So, so anyone who tells you that you don't know when you are being a role model, they're telling you the truth, 'cause he never knew that.  But I said I wanna be just like Mr. Smith one day.  And true enough, one day I did become an Alpha.  And I met him again, and I mean it was just, it was just a great reunion.  But there are people right now who can influence you one way or another, and you may not even be, be aware of it, so.  But I, I don't regret going to the schools that I went to once I came here because I knew in my--I had, I had motivation from other sources.  I mean it was a given for my parents and, and everybody around me that you, you go to school, and you stay in school and what have you.

Speaker 1: Now, did I have a, what I call it a wild period?  I think I did.  Back in those days, you were kind of divided into two camps.  The guys were--and I know this sounds silly.  There were Gousters and there were Ivy Leaguers.
Speaker 2: I've heard this before.
Speaker 1: Okay (Laughter).
Speaker 2: This is for--yeah, this is Chicago [Illinois] history, right.
Speaker 1: Right, it, it is.  And, and I had to be both.
Speaker 2: How did they--can you describe for us the difference between a Gouster and an Ivy Leaguer?
Speaker 1: A Gouster dressed basically like a, a grown man in the styles of the day, the fedoras, the long-collared shirts, the, the pleated pants, cuffs in the pants.  And you know, what you looked like is a--and you couldn't wait for a mustache to grow.  And what you looked like is a miniature version of a grown man, coming to school that way, akin to what maybe the zoot suit was in another generation.  Whereas the Ivy Leaguers were button-down, button-down shirt, and straight, unpleated pants, and maybe penny loafers, and wing tip shoes and, and that sort of thing.  And the idea being, that this kind of identified what track you were on in life.  The Ivy Leaguers were college-bound or what have you.  Well, I argue the point that you dressed the way that was most expedient for you to, to survive and go on.  I remember that all of the people I was around were Gousters.  I was one of the few Gousters who carried books home though, okay (laughter).  And it's funny because when I did--I had two wardrobes actually because I had friends and, and then so--but you didn't wanna get caught at the party in the, in, in, in the wrong outfit (laughter), okay.  And not because it was violent or anything, but it could lead to altercations, but--and the Gousters had what was known as a, a bad boy image, if you know what I mean.  And it was all innocent enough.  It really was, except for the fringes that always takes both to, to extremes.  But it was part of growing up in, in Chicago.  And our, and our, our icon for the era was a disc jockey by the name of Herb the Cool Gent, [HM] Herb Kent, the Cool Gent.  And he was always talking about the Gousters and Ivy Leaguers on the radio and what have you.  Gousters prided themselves in the way they could dance, you know, and, and just an old--the whole bad boy image, but part of growing up.  I tell my kids about it, they laugh (laughter)--(unclear)--they said I can't believe this.  But it was fun.  I mean it was, it was something to do, but--
Story_ID: 176279
Speaker 1: I have a mother [Emma Scarborough Robinson] who, who I must have given her some of her gray hairs because I wanted to dress and do things a certain way, as kids do today.  And I remember her upstairs bedroom window.  She could look out anyone leaving the house and going somewhere.  We always had to have our shirts tucked in you know, and, and look properly.  And no sooner than you get out the house, you take your shirt out and what have you.  And my mother got to the point where she, she caught on, and you'd hear this voice: "Morris, put that shirt back in."  You know, so, so she, she--and you know, during the day, 'cause my dad [Earl Robinson] worked nights, she was the, she was the guiding influence.  And the last thing you wanted to hear her say was, "Don't let me have to tell your father," you know, so that--I can remember coming home from grade school.  I got caught by Mrs. Lewis [ph.] one time we're in, in chorus chewing gum.  My how things have really changed.  And she said, "Morris, take that gum out of your mouth, and I'm calling your mother," 'cause my mother was really involved.  I think it took me two hours to walk three blocks home from school that day, 'cause you just didn't want that kind of thing happening.  My, my parents would say, "Don't ever let a teacher have to call us or let us have to come up to school.  I mean they were old school, okay."  And although it didn't happen often, they didn't spare the, the rod of it.  They didn't brutalize kids, but they--and I, I have to say, growing up in a city like Chicago [Illinois] with that many kids, not one of us have ever seen the inside of a jail or been in trouble.  And those of us, most of us wanted to go to college, went to college and, and, and the like, so they must have done something right.  Now, I didn't--as I raise my kids, I know I use a lot of the same values.  I didn't have to go the route of, of corporal punishment, but there were rules set, and there were standards set, and things that had to be done.  And they turned out wonderful too, so it goes from generation to generation to generation.  And I think you can't deny the value of a good, solid, sound family environment.
Story_ID: 176280
Speaker 1: When you were in high school [at Marshall Metro High School, Chicago, Illinois] were you, did you get involved in club activities--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --in high school and that--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --sort of thing?
Speaker 2: I was on the journalism, staff journalism club, I ran track, and I was on the fencing team.  And that was pretty much it.  I mean that was, that was enough for me.  And I liked girls, so there was always parties (laughter), okay.  There was always a party that you had to go to.  I, I took after my dad in size at that time.  I may not show it now.  I've gained quite a few pounds, but I don't think I ever weigh a pound over 115 or twenty [120 pounds], in high school.  So you, you did what you--and I was a pretty fast sprinter.  But even that's small for, for a sprinter.  It got me, it got me a scholarship to college, which I wasn't able to keep because when I graduated I went to, again, another situation where I can show you the picture.  I showed you the picture, in fact, Dollance Co. [ph.], which is a singing group, where I think there were six black students on campus out of a campus of 1800.  And--
Speaker 1: Now, now this is college?
Speaker 2: That was college, when I graduated from Marshall [Metro High School, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Okay, now, so, so you did fairly well at Marshall, grade wise?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, I--the school--see, the, the--when I, when I say I got lazy, the schools weren't a challenge for me.  So I only did enough to, to, to get by and what have you, but graduating and getting the grades was never a problem.  I just didn't get the same push and the challenge that I did previously.  And of course as a kid, I'm not gonna ask for it either; you know, hey, this is great.  So, but no, I had the grades to go to school and so forth, yeah.
Story_ID: 176281
Speaker 1: Had anyone in your family ever gone to college before?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, oh yeah, my, my older sister and brothers had already set the pattern for it.  My, my parents [Emma Scarborough Robinsion and Earl Robinson] didn't go to college.  On my wife's [Margot Robinson] side they did, but my, my parents didn't.  But no, I had the, had the challenge from--it was always a given you were gonna go to, go to school from my parents, as well as my older sisters and brothers.
Speaker 1: Now how did you choose this particular college?
Speaker 2: Actually, it, it kind of chose.  I, I, I need to backstep a minute.  I initially enrolled into a junior college here in the city, okay.
Speaker 1: Okay, which one was it?
Speaker 2: Loop Junior College [Chicago, Illinois].  I think it still exists.
Speaker 1: It's Harold Washington College [Chicago, Illinois] Snow, yeah.
Speaker 2: Oh, is that right?
Speaker 1: They just, they just changed the name.
Speaker 2: Downtown Chicago?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, okay.  And don't ask me how we--I wound up going--my best friend was a Lutheran.  He was black, but his family was Lutheran.  And he became my best friend, so I'd go to church with him on Sunday, and it was a Lutheran college.  And it was a Lutheran church I mean.  And the senate had come up with money for scholarships, and they asked us if we wanted to go to, go to Luther Col--well, they have a number of Lutheran colleges.  There's Augsburg [College] in [Minneapolis] Minnesota, and Luther College in [Decorah] Iowa, and some others somewhere.  I can't remember where, but I chose to go to Luther and run track there.  Being a small college, when you were, when you, when you participated in a team sport, you had to do double duty and whatever was needed.  And I was a sprinter, but they also had me running cross country.  And early into the season, you know, you put the weight, the ankle weights on.  I told you how small I was.  The, the smallest sweat suit that they had that I could wear--(laughter), you know, if you can imagine it.  Anyway, and I went running off through the, through the woods one day and, and injured myself.  And when the semes--when the year was over, rather than go back, I didn't go back, and I enrolled at Roosevelt University [Chicago, Illinois].
Story_ID: 176282
Speaker 1: So you spent a year at, at Luther [College, Decorah, Iowa]?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay, where is this, in Iowa?
Speaker 2: Iowa, in Decorah, Iowa--
Speaker 1: Decorah.
Speaker 2: --D-E-C-O-R-A-H.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that was an interesting year, though.  We--halfway through the year, we had heard that they had a, an exchange student program (laughter) with some of the Southern black colleges, you know, the--what do they call--HB, Historically Black Colleges, HBCs.  And Spelman [College, Atlanta, Georgia], which, if you're aware of it, is an all-girls school.  And we heard that--and we're all guys.  There were six of us, me from Chica--two of us from Chicago [Illinois], four from North Chicago, and we all played a sport.  I was track, one was baseball and track, and the other four were football.  And we were the only black students there.  but when we heard some exchange students were coming from Spelman, and we heard that at least three of them were women--'cause I guess Spelman has, is right next to Morehouse, and, and they could, they could participate too--oh, we got excited.  And then one day we're sitting around (unclear).  I said you know guys, what makes you think that the most popular, best-looking girls, having a ball down at Spelman, will want to come up here to snowy Iowa, where snow is up to your chin, and, and, and, and, and be an exchange student?  'Cause we're all talking about who's gonna get the first crack at (unclear)--I said I'm gonna let you guys go for (laughter).  And this is terrible, but it turned out, it turned out when, when, when the girls got there, all the guys could [hand up], you know (laughter).  That's terrible.  Don't put that in there, okay (laughter).  But I didn't go back.  I had a good time.  And I, I got very good grades there too, except for, believe it or not, I couldn't get the hang of the new math, 'cause--you know, what was wrong with the old math?  I, I had--that was the, the, the professor gave me a D.  Maybe he gave me a C.  I can't remember.  All the rest of my grades were A's.  And I tell him, I just--my head isn't in this.  I just can't, I can't do it.  I don't understand the theoret--theories and the concepts.  Be--I think part of it was because in early childhood you're taught math by a rote method, you're memorizing, you know that this is true, but you may not know why it's true.  And I guess that's what the new math tried to do, is tell you--show you the why it's true, so.  But that was a good year.  I mean my grades still came out strong, B+, whatever, so.
Story_ID: 176283
Speaker 1: And I just transferred to Roosevelt [University, Chicago, Illinois], and--
Speaker 2: Okay, now what was Roosevelt like?  Now, Roosevelt is in, in the Loop [Chicago, Illinois]--
Speaker 1: Right, downtown.
Speaker 2: --right downtown.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and you know, I'm back home, and, and during my--before going to Luther [College, Decorah, Iowa], you know, I started making friends with people on the South Side and what have you.  And I had friends all over the city.  So Roosevelt just opened the, opened up my, my world a little bit more in Chicago [Illinois], and meeting people, and, and, and doing things further afield and what have you.  And it also allowed me to have a part-time job.  A good buddy and myself, we got part-time jobs at Marshall Field's.  And this is a good story here.  I, I liked that because I could go to school, then walk over to Field's and work whatever hours I needed, and, and go home.  And my buddy and I were in the cafeteria one day, and this beautiful girl walked by.  I mean I, I know it seems like I talk about girls a lot.  But this beautiful girl walked by, and we both--we used to have to wear these little smock jackets, you know, which said you were stock boy or something.  We couldn't get out of those things fast enough.  And by the time she sat down and she had ope--she was reading a book called 'The Man,' which was about the first black president.  And being the brash young guys were in college, we, we ran over and got in front of her and says, and introduced ourselves.  And I mean we're just--and she was looking.  And we're both younger than she is, you know.  She knows this too.  And she said you know, "Morris, I have a younger sister that I'd like for you to meet."  I said, "Well, okay, fine."  So she says, "No, really, I think you'll really like her.  I know you're her type."  So, so she set up a meeting at her house on, on that Friday.  But I was with my buddies, you know, and I never showed up.  So nothing happened.  And Judy, I saw--her name was Judy, and I saw Judy the next week at work.  She said you never came by, why didn't you?  I said oh, I, I forgot.  I made up some, some lame excuse.  And at Roosevelt, Judy's sister had--her best friend was going to Roosevelt at the time too, and her sister had asked who is this Morris guy that, that didn't come by.  So, I found out later she wasn't home either.  She was out partying.  But to make a long story short, she decided to come down to school to see who, who I was.  And I had just gotten back from a fraternity party down at Southern or whatever.  I'd just gotten off the train; I had--and I had to get to work.  And I had my suitcase, a bag or whatever; I had my books.  And this sister came in, and her name was Margot.  And I said look, I gotta go to work.  Can, can we walk and talk.  Here, would you carry my books for me?  And she was just ticked.  I mean she was angry as can be.  And I said why don't we try and get together next week, 'cause I gotta go to work and I don't have time.  Well, to make a long story short, that didn't work out either.  But eventually it did, and I wound up marrying her.  But it was her sister that I saw first.  But we got married when we were twenty-one I think.  And I met her, her father, who at the time was the commanding officer of the old Eighth Illinois Regiment over on Cottage Grove [Avenue, Chicago, Illinois].  That was the Armory.  And he was tough, let me tell you, but we won him over.  Everything really worked out well.
Story_ID: 176284
Speaker 1: I know I jumped ahead a lot, but, but it's funny.
Speaker 2: Yeah, are there any stories around--that sounds like there's an interesting story in there some place.  (Unclear)--
Speaker 1: There are a lot--
Speaker 2: --the commanding officer and you--
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, oh yeah, we--like I said, when we--we were party animals, especially after I, I joined my fraternity.  And we had friends who lived in Lake Meadows [Chicago, Illinois], in that area.  And their mothers would and parents would let them have parties if we moved the furniture.  And when the party was over, put everything back like we had it.  And I tell you, this, this, this occasion I was on the up and up; I really was.  In fact, Judy, Margot's sister, was with us, and a good friend of mine, and we went to the party and we had a good time.  But unfortunately, by the time the party was over and, and we had put the furniture back, it was maybe 4:30 in the morning or whatever.  And we got back to the, to my, my wife's house, and we're trying to be quiet.  And like this house here, he had a big desk about where this thing is.  And we opened the door, we slip in, and the lights are off.  But we can barely make out this man in the bathrobe sitting there like this, you know, the typical military pose.  And all I could think of was, good evening, Colonel Rose.  And he said good morning, Morris (laughter).  I'll never forget it.  It was, it was ice cold; it sent a chill down you.  And I said I know you won't believe this, but we just finished moving the furniture.  Oh, it's moving furniture this time (laughter).  But I'll tell you, he had that edge in his voice.  I said no matter what I do, he's not gonna believe me.  And Margot is trying to explain: "That's exactly what happened, dad, I'm, I'm telling you."  But any rate, I said, "I think I'd just better go," and, and I had to--it took a long time to live that one down.  And I did a couple of other things that weren't too good.  When she graduated from college, I missed the graduation 'cause I decided to go by the frat house first.  And we were singing, and drinking, and dancing and what have you, and before I knew it, I had missed it.  And we weren't married yet, and, and I said oh, my goodness, what am I gonna do now?  When I got there my name was mud, let me tell you.  I don't think my wife still lets me live that one down.  But we prevailed anyway, and we've had a very good, good, good life together.  And her folks are still living too.  He's ninety years old too, and her mother is eighty-four.  But I kind, I'm kind of jumping around I mean, because I obviously left a lot of things out.
Story_ID: 176285
Speaker 1: Well, what did you do--well, in college, at, at Roosevelt [University, Chicago, Illinois], were there any professors that really stand out as people who, who took--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --an interest in your or--
Speaker 2: Not, not really.  I mean it was just, it was just school.  I mean there was nothing that--I don't--I wish I did have some good college, in college memories.  But college at that time was just go to school and get, get the job done.  I mean it wasn't, it wasn't pretty much hanging around the school.  We hung around the frat [fraternity] house more than we did, did school.  And the frat house was, you know, forty--what is--4400 South on King Drive.  So, at the time it was the only chapter of Alpha Phi Alpha in the city.  So it took in members from all the universities, and it was just called the city chapter.  Now I think Chicago [Illinois] may have--all the, all the universities have their own chapter now, 'cause my son pledged at Loyola [University at Chicago, Chicago, Illinois], and my other son pledged at U of I [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Champaign, Illinois] downstate.  But I think U of I city Chicago [University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, Illinois] has its own chapter; IIT [Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago, Illinois] has its own chapter; Loyola, so I mean, but back in those days, it was just one, and, and they were extremely--what's the word I wanna use?  It was difficult to become--I mean you had to, you had to really be wanting to get in.  And I'm glad that day is over with too.  What interrupted it all for me was, was a little action that is referred to as the Vietnam conflict [Vietnam War].  Back in those days, you could be drafted even if you're in school.  It was before the lottery and so forth.
Speaker 1: Did, did you graduate from Roosevelt first?
Speaker 2: No, that's just it.  I was drafted--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --out of school.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Now, I imagine a lot of people say why didn't you go to your father-in-law?  I wasn't married at the time, but we, we got married right before I went in.  Why didn't you go to your father-in-law or why did you apply for a, a waiver or whatever?  And I--to tell you the truth, I kind of wanted to go.  And so, I was commissioned a second lieutenant in artillery, which is--when I got drafted I knew nothing about the [U.S.] military.  And--
Speaker 1: Did you have ROTC [Reserve Officers' Training Corps]--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --or anything like that?
Speaker 2: No, no, I knew nothing about the military, I mean in terms of branches.  I take that back.  When I was in Crain I had ROTC, but--I mean I don't even remember what it was about.  But the Army is comprised of, of different disciplines, branches, you know.  You have, you got artillery, you got armor, you got infantry, you got Corps of Engineers, you know.  Those are what I mean by branches.  So, in the whole draft class that I was in, I remember the, the company commander came into the barracks and said--called my name and somebody else's.  I don't even remember, said you, get over to the office.  You guys, the old man wants to talk to you.  And I mean we were still in basic training, so I don't know.  I didn't even know what the old man meant, you know, except for some old man wants to talk to me.  Anyway, we got here and he said that you guys did very well on your testing, and you have an opportunity to go to OCS if you'd like to.  And I knew what Officers Candidate School was, and I said fine.  And then he said so, before you sign, what branch do you wanna go into?  I said branch?  Army is the Army to me, so.  I said can I call my, my father-in-law and, and ask him a question.  Sure, go right ahead.  I picked up the phone.  I'll never forget that--I dial the phone, and my, my father-in-law answered.  I said hello, Colonel Rose?  And their eyes looked (laughter)--you know, they, they looked up, and I said, hi, this is Morris.  And then I said listen, they, the, they said I can go to OCS, and I need to pick a branch.  And without hesitation he said pick artillery, 'cause that was his branch.  Anyway, so, and he didn't have any surviving sons, and by this time, he was starting to live vicariously through me anyway.  So I hung up the phone.  I said I'll take artillery.  And typical Army, they sent me to OCS for artillery, trained me as a Ford observer, you know what that is?  That's someone who's out there in enemy land looking for targets to call rounds in on, artillery rounds on.  And I was pretty good.  I, I, I enjoyed the work.  And so what was my assignment when I graduated?  They put me with missiles, and I had never seen a missile (laughter).  But they gave us an opportunity to, my wife and I, to go over to Italy and live for a while.  Some of the things you see around here are things we picked up.  Those little muskets you, you, you see in there and so forth, clocks and so forth, but--
Story_ID: 176286
Speaker 1: Well, so, so the, the Vietnam conflict [Vietnam War] was going on, but they didn't send you to Vietnam.  They sent you to--
Speaker 2: Well, here's an interesting story.  And eventually I got to, I got to Southeast Asia.  But in OCS [Officers Candidate School], the, the week or two before you graduate, they have what's known as dream sheet day.  You're supposed to put down where you would really like to be assigned.  I had a roommate.  We didn't call each other bunkmates; that's officers and gentlemen didn't do that.  You were roommates.  His name was Stefans [ph.].  And you were assigned your room by alphabetical order, so S followed R, so Stef and I got a room together.  And as a byproduct of that, whenever you were in class or whatever, you always sat together too.  So on dream sheet day, this, this major comes in with the forms to fill out and said okay, guys, you get a chance to dream a bit.  Where would you like to be assigned once you're commissioned?  And you hear all this buzz.  Nobody wanted to go to Vietnam.  Put down Germany; put down Korea; put down--I said, "Stef, why don't we put down Italy?"  And you don't know what's gonna happen.  And then on the day of graduation, you've thrown your hats up in the air, and you're in the--you're saying goodbyes in the barracks.  And our, our tack officer comes in and says okay, I got assignments.  Then he starts off, "Anderson, Vietnam; Brown, Vietnam, Johnson, Vietnam."  Every now and then there'd be Germany.  And he got to Robinson, there was a pause, "Italy; Stefans, Italy; Williams, Vietnam" (laughter)--(unclear)--so I said it was just the luck of the draw.  So we, we spent a wonderful two years in, in Italy.  My wife was there for a year and a half, and then she had to come back because then I started getting some very top secret assignments that I could--she could not be around and be a part of.  Because when I told you I was with the missiles, it was babysitting and deploying atomic weapons.  So, the muck--the, the, the comic book titles you hear like my clearan--my, my, my clearance was--see if I can remember--cosmic secret--no, Cosmic Cryptic Top Secret.  That was my clearance.  Any communist countries, the only way I could go over them is I had to be at least 35,000 feet in the air because of the knowledge I had of, at the time, of what our nuclear arsenal was.  I could not visit communist countries.  And I pretty much had to watch everything.  Now we had what was known as escape and evasion.  And as I said, we babysitted these nuclear warheads.  And I'll never forget, they said in the event that the base is overrun, it is your duty to destroy these warheads, and make your way to a friendly country like Austria or which or at the time was an ally.  And Italy still had a lot of communists there, so you didn't know.  So they said now, the best thing to do is travel by night, sleep by day, but if you, if you're spotted, keep your mouth shut and just act normal.  Major, I got a question for you.  That may work for you white guys, but what about me?  I mean I can't just casually walk through--I--sounds like you said Robinson, you're just shit out of luck (laughter).  And I'll never forget that.  And so I'm glad that nothing ever happened, and I had to, had to do that.  But we armed all of our allies with, with--not all of 'em, but the responsible ones--with nuclear warheads.  And basically, me and thirty other troops babysat those, those warheads.  Then my job later was to see how they could be deployed if necessary to Southeast Asia.  And to this day, I believe they were deployed, but I don't know that for a fact, so don't--I mean I'm not gon' say that that happened.  But I had to do--because I was commissioned, I had to take on extra years.  In fact, I'd even entertained the thought of careering military like my wife's parents--her father did and so forth.  But I realized that, hey, I still got a year of school to go.  So I went back and got my degree and then went on to graduate school.
Speaker 1: Now, now you graduated from Roosevelt [University, Chicago, Illinois]--
Speaker 2: Roosevelt University.
Speaker 1: In, in, in what year?  What year was it?
Speaker 2: Let me think now.
Speaker 1: You were in the service, what, in '68 [1968]?
Speaker 2: I was in the service from '67 [1967] through '70 [1970].
Story_ID: 177439
Speaker 1: You graduated from high school [Marshall Metro High School, Chicago, Illinois] in '63 [1963].  You attended Loop College [later Harold Washington College, Chicago, Illinois], Luther College in [Decorah] Iowa.  You were at Roosevelt [University, Chicago, Illinois]--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --in, in six--from '67 [1967] to '71 [1971] you were in the [U.S.] Army.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Right, and then--
Speaker 2: From '60--I went in '66 [1966].  I went in the service--
Speaker 1: Sixty-six [1966], okay.
Speaker 2: --went in the service in '66 [1966].
Speaker 1: All right, and, and you were there until '71 [1971]?
Speaker 2: Till '70 [1970].
Speaker 1: Seventy [1970], all right.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: I did three years, is that right?
Speaker 1: And then when you came back you went back to Roosevelt in--
Speaker 2: I went back to Roosevelt part time and started working.
Speaker 1: And you finished in '73 [1973].
Speaker 2: Right, finished in '73 [1973].
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so was it, was it--
Speaker 2: Think I, I changed my major in everything, so.
Speaker 1: Well, what was your major in--
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: --initially?
Speaker 2: --originally, when I, when I was in school, I, I was just going to school, but I was concentrating my--primarily for a career in teaching.  When I came back, because I considered law school, I took--I changed my major to political science and had to take several courses that weren't in my, my curricular assignment in, to pass.  And I, I got what I considered a good break, too, in that I was--I submitted a resume.  I ran into a friend who was an officer at--an officer, meaning a bank officer, not a police officer--at First National Bank of Chicago, one of my old fraternity brothers.  And we hadn't seen each other in years, 'cause granted I had been gone a long time.  And he told me, hey, man, I'm on this program here at First Chicago.  You should, you should submit a resume.  And I said okay, fine.  My graduation was coming up and so forth.  And, and I submitted the resume, and they, they hired me to start a, a branch management training program.  'Cause at the time--I don't wanna go too far off in this tangent, but at the time, Illinois was one of the states that only allowed unit banks.  You couldn't have branches anywhere.  But there was reason to believe that in the not too distant future legislation would change and would allow banks to have branches.  Now they're all over the place, but back then there, there was a law called the Glass-Steagall Act that prevented branches and so forth after the [Great] Depression.  I digress.  But anyway, the, the bank felt that it was gonna happen, and they were looking for, for young, sharp people who, who could be the cadre that would, would establish the first.  So, I got that position and, and started the program from scratch.  I never got into a branch bank, but I rose to the rank of vice president.
Speaker 1: Now this is at which bank?  This is--
Speaker 2: First National Bank of Chicago--
Speaker 1: First National, okay.
Speaker 2: --which is now Bank One and been a couple of other things.
Story_ID: 177440
Speaker 1: At the time, here I find myself again.  When I became an officer of the bank [First National Bank of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois], there were probably only twenty black officers.  In fact, it may have been fewer; it may have been only ten.  Now, there are probably a few hundred, but back in those days...  And man, I don't wanna, I don't wanna come off sounding negative, but there were some of the most bigoted people working in that bank that you ever wanna see.  And I had a love/hate relationship with it.  I think I did pretty well, considering the times.  We, we certainly blazed the trail for many of the black folks to, to follow.  But I had a good buddy there, one of my best friend to this day.  His name is Toussaint Hale.  He just retired from the bank maybe two years ago as a, as vice president.  And we saw--it was also a period of time when we had some of the brightest black kids coming out of Ivy League schools.  I mean this, these were the best coming out of the schools, getting these positions.  And we saw this bank chew them up and spit 'em out.  I'm just reflecting on, on some, some sad memories that, that I, I hate to see that happen.  Eventually, the, the, the ones who caught on to the came learned that, hey, there are some black officers here who have survived.  How did they do it?  Because in the beginning, these, these kids are filled with, with the idea that, hey, they're the best and the brightest, and I don't need advice and so forth.  To this day I need advice in whatever I do, and I seek it out from wiser heads or experienced people.  But to make a long story short, it really broke our hearts to see so many bright, wonderful kids leaving, doubting themselves, and I'm sure it scarred them for, for lives in many cases.
Speaker 2: Now how did you manage to avoid this--
Speaker 1: I think I was a little older now.  I was, I was married and, and pretty much stable.  But remember, I'd had some life experiences that they hadn't.  I'd gone through the service.  I had seen things that I don't even wanna talk about today to people.  I have--and, and I think that helps.  And, and one of the things that you do is you have to conform to some degree.
Story_ID: 177441
Speaker 1: I remember a young man who came out of Dartmouth [College, Hanover, New Hampshire] who--at the time, you know, the, the dress style was--you may not know it was bell bottoms and, and shirts with prints on 'em and what have you.  And that was fine, but not, not proper bank wear.  And he was put in my charge.  And I would wear the traditional blue-stripe suit and white shirt and tie.  Now I refused to wear wing tip shoes and button-down collars to this day, but that's another story.  But one day we were going to I think the Union League Club or the Standard Club or something for lunch, and it was some banking thing.  And he was saying, man, you a sellout.  Well, look at you.  Look how you dress.  You, you dress one of them.  I said no, well, I don't know if I'm a sellout or not.  I'm saying that I came to them for this job.  They said this is the dress code.  It's my decision do I want to conform or not.  And besides that, I kind of like this.  This is a fine suit.  I like it.  He said but that's not your culture.  I said what is our culture?  Your African culture.  So should I be wearing a loin cloth and a spear, or a long robe or what?  He said I get your point.  And from that day on, I know that he started coming to work--and he was a bright kid.  Don't get me wrong.  He started wearing the traditional suits and what, I said, "Oh."  If you wanna succeed, you don't own this bank.  When you own your own bank, dress the way you want.  But if you want to move on, these are some of the things you have to conform to.  And you're not giving your culture up for that.  I mean this Western style of dress.  This is acceptable dress for this environment.  What are you giving up?  So, I, I only use that as an example of, of back in those days, you know, kids were, were fiercely--black pride was, was an issue, you know, and what have you.  And, and you, you had to show that you had this.  My thing is black pride is from inside.  And you show black pride by accomplishment, and what you can do, and what you want to do.  That's black pride.  I don't care what you wear, but that does not signify black pride.  But we sounded like old fogies.  After all, I was in my late twenties by then, okay.  And Toussaint [L'Overture Hale] was ten years older than I am, and he was my best buddy.  So, but when you're twenty-one or twenty-two, and you just graduated from Yale [University, New Haven, Connecticut] or Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts], hey, you know everything, 'cause I know when I was in college I knew everything.
Story_ID: 177442
Speaker 1: The first year I came home from school, from Iowa, from Luther College [Decorah, Iowa], the first thing a person wants to do is get out and party and what have you.  But I'll never forget this incident, and, and I could--I can't remember the last time my mother [Emma Scarborough Robinson] had touched me.  But I came home on a Friday.  I don't think my mother saw me till that Sunday.  And granted, this was the first week I was back home from school.  And when I did come home, I had taken off my clothes and just threw 'em (unclear), and I crawled in the bed.  And I had probably been drinking and partying with the frat brothers.  And about six or seven o'clock that morning I hear this fussing.  My mother's in the kitchen, and she's picking clothes up and (unclear)--and mind you, I'm the oldest kid at home now.  So, I get up out of bed, and I go in the kitchen.  And I said what is all this noise about?  She said look at this.  You've got clothes all over the place, and you make a mess, and you don't appreciate this.  And I, and, and a young cocky student like me, I said--I was going to say I didn't ask to be here, you know.  But you don't talk to an old-fashioned mothers like that.  I never got that out.  I said I didn't ask--she knew what I was gonna say.  Now my mother stands about five feet two.  And she turned around and tried to give me a backhand, and it barely touched me.  But I went back instinctively, and I'm, I was sliding down the wall laughing.  And as I was sliding down, then she said and you'd better thank your god that you are here.  And all I could do is get up and hug her.  And I said, mother, I love you (laughter), and I started picking up the stuff and what have you.  I said it'll never happen again.  But I mean, I, I say that only to say that there is always a time and a place for everything.  And there's always someone you can go to, ain't no matter what, educational level or what you may think it is, who are far wiser than you are.  And I think that it took these young kids awhile to learn that.  But once it's learned, I think networking went through the box and, and that, that's, that's a common vernacular now amongst anybody, whether they're, they're black, white, or whatever.
Story_ID: 177443
Speaker 1: I have mixed feelings about the bank [First National Bank of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois].  I enjoyed working there.  I met some wonderful people and I met some awful people, and I guess that could be said for any place.  But these--
Speaker 2: What were some of the awful things that were done in the bank, you know?  Then may, may, maybe tell us some good things.  But, but what were some the awful things, things, 'cause you said there--
Speaker 1: Well--
Speaker 2: --really are some, some, some terrible characters there.
Speaker 1: There were, and let me just give you an example.  In any environment, employment environment, you have performance standards and you have performance reviews.  And I'll never forget I worked in this one particular area that was notoriously staffed by bigoted people.  I, I don't know any other way to say that, but they were.  And I'll never forget, I didn't, I didn't work in that area.  I was in training in that area.  I reported to an executive vice president who started this training program.  And so in the performance review the, the VP in charge of the area wrote: "Although Morris is friendly and outgoing, nobody likes him."  Now I had done enough reviews in my lifetime for people, and as well (unclear)--and this, this absolutely makes no sense.  I knew what kind of person he was, but I couldn't believe how he could be this dense.  I couldn't believe that he was a vice president using the word "uses" when he spoke.  But that was a level of the people we're dealing with.  So I took the review and I went to see my boss.  And I said, "You know, here's a review.  I want you to read this."  I said, "If it says Morris is friendly and outgoing, but nobody likes him, whose fault is that?"  And I'll never forget, he just threw it back at me and said, "Prove him wrong."  And I appreciated that he did that.  Because I, I, I'm not in any way paralleling it to Jackie Robinson, but I'm saying that he had the same kind of attitude, go out there and prove 'em wrong.  Nobody's gonna hold your hand.  Prove 'em wrong.  And so when you did get the promotions and what have you, you knew you got them legitimately.  I, I can't imagine what Jackie Robinson went through when he would come out to bat, and all the invectives that were, were hurled at him, and--I mean (unclear).  But you needed someone who is tough enough to open that door and keep that door open.  So I believe that Toussaint and I did a tremendous job.  And what we did at that bank, in opening the door and keeping it open.  And you know, generations later, we look at--now you're looking at executive VPs who are black and what have you, someone blazed that trail.  I think on a larger scope I look in the same way.  All this talk about affirmative action and this and what have you, if it wasn't for affirmative action, doors would have never been open.  The, the, the, the, the, the playing field is not level, and it's not gonna be level for some time.  But why I think it's been so distorted is that this is nothing new.  There has been affirmative action since, since the dawn of this country, not for us, but for the majority.  So that it only became a bad thing when it's supposedly was used to rectify centuries of wrongdoing.  Now it's one that covers, it, it covers everybody, regardless of what you are, if you're a minority, if you just moved to this country from Syria, you know, you can, you can use it as a redress.  But that's what--not what its original intent was.  But I guess--and I know I'm kind of digressing a bit here--it was a sign of the times that when you got in those doors you could either open the door a little wider, or you can wash out.  And, and experiences like that--and that was just an example.  There were experiences that I could tell you time and time again that you had to deal with, on top of what your responsibilities were.
Story_ID: 177444
Speaker 1: The same, the same--you asked for examples--the same unit that I was in [at First National Bank of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois] a customer had sent a check for an amount of, I don't know, a few hundred thousand dollars to go into the trust account.  And by the time it had made--the check was missing, and by the time it had made the rounds, Morris Robinson had lost this check I this amount.  And I mean the hammers were dropping on me, and I said wait a minute, shouldn't someone ask me if I know anything about it?  Which I didn't; I knew nothing about--it turns out the customer's name was Morrison.  They had--by the time it had made the route, the, the, the name had morphed into Morris Robinson was received the check, and he was supposed to do something with it.  Mind you, I don't have anything to do with--and when the, when the dust cleared, and after all of this, and all the ringers that they put me through, I said doesn't someone owe me an apology?  And I mean--oh, we've handled that.  Don't (unclear)--you know.  That's the way it was, and, and, and you had no idea what could be circulating around at any given time.  And it, it, it creates an environment that can be very, very difficult to work in.  And, and I think, I think that probably the best thing could have happened is the first group of officers that came to that bank, it's best that they had been a little older than just being right out of college with no kind of experience and what have you.  Because I think it was far more effective that way because we had seen some experiences that we had, had seen some, some things in life that at least gave you the opportunity to deal with it and no--had that experience in it, so.  And I, and I ran into similar things in the service.  When I was in the service, in all the branches there were only 5,000 officers of all ranks.  Today that's, that's, that's changed tremendously.  I mean we're talking about [U.S.] Air Force, [U.S.] Army, [U.S.] Marines.  And many of these troops had never seen a black officer.  And I shudder to think what my father-in-law went through as a career military man.  The things he did, I mean he told me stories about, as a young captain on a train in the South where German prisoners of war were treated better than he was, you know, so I knew what it was like, but when you start experiencing it firsthand.  But here again, was a case where I could go back to someone who had experience, and talk with them, and learn how to handle a situation and so forth, because obstacles were continually thrown in, in, in your way.
Story_ID: 177445
Speaker 1: Now, now is there an upside?  Now what's the upside?
Speaker 2: Oh, the upside of, of working in the bank [First National Bank of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois] is that, that one, it allowed me to learn about business, I mean real business, you know.  And, and it broadened my education.  I met some great, great people, people who've since gone on to do many great things in this city and the world too who worked in that bank.  I met some wonderful, wonderful contemporaries who are just in their own areas today doing, doing great things.  That, that's a great upside because, having said everything I just said, Larry, things have improved tremendously in this country.  Things have improved tremendously to the point where you now find us in every walk of life, every field, every--doing, doing things.  And this has all happened probably in the last twenty-five or thirty years.  All the preparation up until that time, opening the doors, knocking down barriers by the Martin Luther Kings of the world and have you has created what I consider now to be this cornucopia of opportunity, if we can just get our young black folks' head on straight, which is another thing I am involved with now, working with young black kids, particularly males, to see what opportunities they have, the alternative.  It's not what you came from.  It's what you can be, and you have that opportunity now.  My kids went to Evanston Township High School [Evanston, Illinois].  Evanston Township High School is better equipped than any college I ever went to, even Roosevelt University.  And I'm saying that the doors are open now.  That's what the whole battle was about.  Get in there and just absorb everything you can like a sponge.  The world is yours.  You can--you don't have to work for somebody else.  You can start your own business, but just get in there and learn.  And so I've got this crusade.  I mean I stopped, I stop kids on the street at lunchtime when I'm out doing city business.  Why aren't you in school?  And, and there are two Robinson families here that are very well know, ours and my good friend, Leon Robinson who owns a bus company.  And I'm forever being confused with him and probably got confused with Crystal too.  So we, we just tell everybody we're just cousins, you know, just to, just avoid the confusion.  But to make a long story short, he's, he's a very good friend.  And, and so, when I do this, in many cases they know who I am.  Oh, I'm on my way to school and what have you.  But I just think of the turn of the lost time that they could be in the schools.  As of right now, Evanston graduates and sends to college about 80-some odd percent of their students.  It could be so many more going if these kids would take advantage of it.
Story_ID: 177446
Speaker 1: Along the way I've joined organizations, and you know, our, our families gave--up until recently was giving a, a scholarship to, to, to students for over, for the past ten years or so.  We work with kids all the time, trying to reverse this.  I don't know if you've ever heard of, of the Boule; Sigma Pi Phi Fraternity is what it is, but we, it's generally known the Boule.  We have within our Boule what's known as a social action activity where we do outreach in the community.  But we are giving particular emphasis to young black males.  When you got more young black males incarcerated than are in college, you got a problem.  When you've got young black males who are adopting a lifestyle that if they get in too deep, it's almost impossible to extricate 'em from 'em, this, this whole, what do you call it, hip-hop jon, jon--genre.  And there's not anything wrong with hip-hip, just as we had rhythm and blues or whatever the case may be.  That's not the real world though.  Enjoy it or what have you, but don't try to live it.  Don't try to live these videos.  See, when we were coming along we didn't have videos, you know.  We heard the songs, and you had to be able to sing (laughter), otherwise you get laughed off the stage.
Speaker 2: Now you can kind of rap.
Speaker 1: Right, you can rap or you can have so much music behind you and what have you, and if you can dance, you can get over with that.  But these, these videos always shows the scantily clad young women who are being disrespected in every way, shape you can think of.  And, and the, the, this, the whole image that's given, the, the, the, the thuggish life and that sort of thing, that's, that's all fantasy.  But I think we've got too many young kids trying to live it as if it's a reality.  And, and then I don't have to tell you about how pervasive the, the, the illegal drug traffic has, has entered into the black community and what it's done to just generation after generation.  We got an uphill battle, but we gotta keep, keep fighting it and keep moving on with it to get it, to get it taken care of.
Story_ID: 177447
Speaker 1: So, so you're in--now, how, how long were you at, at, at--
Speaker 2: First [Bank of] Chicago [Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 1: At First Chicago, yeah.
Speaker 2: About fifteen years.
Speaker 1: Fifteen years, okay, all right.
Speaker 2: From there I went to Allstate--mistake.  And I let Allstate buy me.  And I just saw the amount that was being offered, and I said never, ever--but I had second (unclear)--doubt.  I had doubts from the start when I got there.  Said I don't like this.  I don't like what I'm doing.  Nothing bad ever happened, but six years later I left and started my own business.
Speaker 1: They just offered you a bigger salary--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, I mean they offered some, some, some nice money.  What they did is, you know, Allstate at the time was part of Sears.  And Sears has a, a reputation and a history of promoting within, and you stay there long enough and what have you.  But the only problem with that is they never brought in much new blood with new thinking and what have you.  So Allstate, under new management, says you know, we gotta break that cycle.  We need to get different kinds of experiences in here (laughter).  And a friend of mine told me about it, and he submitted my resume.  And they came, they came for me, and I said yeah, I'll go.  And this was their way of bringing in new ideas and so forth.  It wasn't just me.  There were others they brought in too.  But in the department I ran, every time I tried to introduce a new idea, I ran into it, not just from below, but from above.  That's not how we do it.  I, I know, but we're here to try something different.  And so for six years that was basically it.  That's not how we do it around here, because they still had too many of the old management side, where it never worked anywhere else but there, where it came up through the ranks.  Many of them, believe it or not, may have been hired as clerks or salespeople.  They performed well, and they just moved--there's nothing wrong with that.  Don't get me wrong.  So they--that whole culture is engrained with them.  They can't change.  What has to happen is new generations have to come in and change it, you know.  And since they weren't--and now we, we're in an era where you don't get in a job and stay for life anymore, that's not a problem anymore.  But back then, more often than not, the managers and the supervisors had been there all their working lives, no place else.  And they were accustomed to doing things one way and one way only.
Story_ID: 177448
Speaker 1: Now where did you go after Allstate?
Speaker 2: Oh, I started my own business [Robinson Designs] with my son [Morris "Dino" Robinson, Jr.].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And we start--
Speaker 1: Now what--yeah, what, what kind of business is this?
Speaker 2: It was a graphic design.  It started off as graphic design--
Speaker 1: And, and what, what, what year is this now that you--
Speaker 2: Nineteen ninety [1990], nineteen ninety [1990].
Speaker 1: Okay, (unclear) and the graphic design business now, was your son trained as an artist?
Speaker 2: My son is a graphic designer, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He graduated from Loyola University [at Chicago, Chicago, Illinois] with high honors, and he received a prestigious Mellon Award.  I'm bragging on him, if you don't mind, forgive me.  Any rate, he had been working with some of the major advertising agencies downtown and realized he wanted to do his own thing.  And so we encouraged him, and he started a, a, a design business.
Speaker 1: What was the name of it.
Speaker 2: Alpha--no, it started off as Robinson--it, it started off as Robinson Designs.  And an opportunity came up for me to purchase a, a growing business called Alpha Word, which was a, which was typography and, and you know, all kinds of ancillary services for, for the office.  So we incorporated that into the business and changed the name (unclear), and ultimately it just became the Robinson Group.  And I did that for ten years.  We--one element--I made a mistake.  I brought in another element, and at, at the time it seemed like a wonderful opportunity.  Wireless services was just starting to get really popular.  And Ameritech was looking for independent agents.  And I figured we could do that too, so I signed on with, as an agent for Ameritech.  It was, it was akin to a franchise.  And so we set up that office, and it, and for a couple of years it really great.  But what Ameritech did, in my opinion, is they brought on agents long enough for them to capture their market share.  Then they started making it untenable to maintain a position.  When I started, we were getting a hundred and fifty, a hundred and seventy-five dollars an account, every account we signed up, plus residuals.  By the time I had to cash it in, they had reduced it all the way down to twenty-five.  Can't survive, but it also serves as a lesson learned that, that never grow your business base on just one major customer or client.  Rule of thumb, you just do it because if that customer ever changes on you, you're up, you're up the creek.  I'm proud to say we never missed a payroll, but after that and I realized that I was getting a little old in the tooth, you know, so, so my son continued on with the graphic design business.  And my experience or timing, the mayor of this fine city wanted to know if I would be interested, and I should seek, seek the development.  And with my background, they, they jumped on it, so that worked out well.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I've been with them for five years now.
Speaker 1: So you were living in Evanston [Illinois] already by this--
Speaker 2: Oh yes, oh yes.
Speaker 1: --time, time, okay, yeah.
Speaker 2: Oh yes, oh yeah.  I may have--I might not have mentioned it to you, but when I started at the bank, we were still living in Chicago [Illinois].  No, I'm sorry, we had just moved from Chicago to Glenview, Glenview, Illinois.  But after being at the bank a few years--I don't know if the name Abner Mikva rings a bell with you.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Abner Mikva was living in Evanston on Sheridan Road.  I bought his house.
Speaker 1: Okay, let's stop there and change.  Now he's the one that was killed, right?  I'm thinking, I'm thinking about Lee Miglin, yeah.
Speaker 2: Oh, oh, okay.
Speaker 1: Lee Miglin, that's who I was thinking about--
Speaker 2: --yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --yeah, that last name got me.
Speaker 2: Well, Mikva is a political--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --household name around Chicago, especially back in the '60s [1960s].
Speaker 1: Abner Mikva.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Abner.
Speaker 1: I've heard of him.  I've heard of him.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he, he was a liberal out of Hyde Park [Chicago, Illinois], Democrat.
Story_ID: 176297
Speaker 1: To my knowledge, we were the first black family to move on Sheridan Road [Evanston, Illinois].  And that was in--and it raised a few eyebrows for a while.  Jimmy Carter's [President James Earl "Jimmy" Carter], President Carter's son [Jack Carter] and his wife lived around the corner from us.  And so when his mother would come to visit--his grandmother, I'm sorry, would come to visit, they--we'd go to the--well, my wife and kids would go to the beach with them.  They were interesting people.
Speaker 2: This is Rosalyn Carter?
Speaker 1: Yeah, not--her mother, her mother.
Speaker 2: Her mother--oh, her mother okay, okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  It was her son, Rosalyn's son lived around the corner from us.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  I don't know where he's living today though.  He looked like his father.  So we lived on Sheridan Road about fifteen years too.  Before--after the kids were grown and finished school and what have you, we, we, we moved here.
Speaker 2: Now for the City of Evanston [Illinois], what job were hired for you--you were hired as the--
Speaker 1: The economic development planner--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --for the city.
Speaker 2: All right, so you've been (unclear) this job for--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --quite, quite a while.
Speaker 1: Right, right, well for five years, yeah.
Speaker 2: Right, okay--
Speaker 1: And, and this will be my last job too.  (Laughter) I don't plan on working anywhere else.  And I'm looking--not looking forward for the time to go by fast, but in probably three years or so I'm gonna be retiring.
Story_ID: 176298
Speaker 1: Okay, now you're in this position at a time when Evanston's [Illinois] doing a lot of economic development, and--
Speaker 2: Oh, absolutely.
Speaker 1: --building downtown--
Speaker 2: We--
Speaker 1: --right?
Speaker 2: --we've probably done probably in the neighborhood of a billion dollars of, of redevelopment in the city since I've been on board.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And it's been, it's been, you know, tied with my financial background and what have you.  It's, it's a real learning experience too.  You know, even though I have experience, you should be learning something new every day.  And this has really helped me to learn how to, how to package development deals in the negotiation aspects of them and all that goes in.  Some of our major development deals--the first biggest one we did took four years to come to fruition, from the time a proposal is made to the time it was completed.  We've (unclear) for big one, and we've got that down now to a pretty good science of maybe a couple of years, so that's pretty good.  And that's not counting all the little projects that are, that are going on throughout the city.  So, guess it's been--it, it had to have been fate.  It seems to me that every time I've done something new in my life, it's always at the right time when things are happening.  I mean, you may not call it a happening, but when I went in the service, Vietnam [the Vietnam War] was happening; when I went into the bank, you know, that was opening up, and that was happening; when I went to, to Allstate, the same thing; starting my own business and now, and now this.  So I, I have to say that my, my life in terms of, of career has always been exciting for me.  I never got into a--a rudder, so to speak.
Story_ID: 176299
Speaker 1: Well, now, being in charge of economic planning and development in Evanston [Illinois] has got to be a challenge because you have--it's the seat of Northwestern University [Evanston, Illinois].  And a great many social activists and people that are equipped to criticize development--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --live in Evanston.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: And so I, I would just--in fact, a lot of the people that are act--activists in Chicago [Illinois] actually live in Evanston, and so, I--
Speaker 2: You, you, you hit it right on the head.  I mean it may, I may exaggerate it, but if we wanted to paint a street down--paint a, paint a line down the street, we get people coming out, determining which is the best white shade to use for the strip, you know.  So, so you're, you're absolutely right.  It's, it's a constant managing to facilitate the, the citizens, the project, and keeping the core straight as to what is good for the city.  It's interesting, if it's about design, everybody's an architect.  We know--but we may not know what we like--we, we know what we like.  We may not know what that is, but we know what we like, so.  If it's economic, everybody becomes a financial person.  If it's what impact it's gonna have on the city, everyone becomes a traffic engineer.  That's your right, and I support that 100 percent.  And because in, in this city the democratic process--not party, process--is always in effect.  And so, one of the things that adds to the time of doing a project is the fact that there are countless town meetings, and, and open microphones, and facing objections to this or that or whatever.  And I think that's one of the beautiful things about Evanston.  I think that's why Evanston people love Evanston: that you can get involved in city government; that you can be heard.  Last night I was at a city council meeting--I'm sorry, the night before last.  Monday I was a city coun- city council meeting where citizens can go to the mic and, and talk about everything they want to.  And you have to sit there and listen and address it.  One of the last speakers was an elderly man who had been living out of his van in the city. And unfortunately, he had parked it in a tow away zone, and they, in effect, towed away his home.  And he made a very impassioned, eloquent speech to the city council.  And I say this because it, it--even the least empowered have a voice in Evanston, and that's good.  Has it always been that case?  No, and that's why it's important that you, you see my son's [Morris "Dino" Robinson, Jr.] journal that he publishes, which has been well-received.
Story_ID: 176300
Speaker 1: My son is also the, the, the chairman--the president of the Evanston Historical Society, the first black and probably youngest person ever to be so.  But he has chronicled--
Speaker 2: What his name?
Speaker 1: His name is Morris [Robinson], Jr.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But we call him Dino, D-I-N-O.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And he has chronicled the history of Evanston [Illinois], you know, awards and all.  But--
Speaker 2: Is he the young man that wrote the history of black Evanston?  There's, there's a young man I met a few years ago had a history of the black community in Evanston.
Speaker 1: It probably him--it's probably him.
Speaker 2: It's published too.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I mean it's--
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: --in book form.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's probably him.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  So, and we're very proud of him.
Story_ID: 176301
Speaker 1: But Evanston [Illinois]--I've lived, as you might guess, in many places, including overseas and what have you.  And Evanston still ranks amongst the best places I've ever lived.  And I will always live here, even though I'm going to be buying a place in, in the warmer area (laughter), you know, but I will always keep a place here.  I like to golf, and I like to fish, but I, I can't retire and just do that.  I have to be involved in something and might as well be involved in the town that I live in to, to, you know, for that kind of involvement, you know, civic outreach.
Speaker 2: Now what is it when in this highly organized city where they say if you're not--if it's seven o'clock and you're, you're not at a meeting, you're not being a citizen (laughter)?  In this city they actually, they actually say that around here, but--
Speaker 1: Yeah, they do.  We've got--I, you know, I often ask someone--you know, you get to be friends with them, and I'll pull 'em aside and say you don't have to be at this meeting.  But you gotta remember, many of Evanstonians were born and raised here.  This is their life.  And especially if you're retired, this is a way of just keeping involved and knowing what's going on and so forth.  And, and our spirit of volunteerism in Evanston, what Chicago [Illinois] may have to pay for.  We have waiting lists of people wanting to volunteer to be on committees, you know, so.  So even though you may get a citizen volunteer on a committee who is just giving you the fits, you have to appreciate that this person cares.  He or she is donating time--they don't get paid for it--to try and work and make this the best city it can be.  Whether you believe what they believe or not, you have to give them that.
Story_ID: 176302
Speaker 1: Now what, what has been the toughest, I guess, spot that you've been in as a, as a planner and developer with people in the city, were you ever really in a, in a--caught between a rock and a hard place?
Speaker 2: Well, not between a rock and a hard place, but one that really stretched the limit.  When we first started the plans for redeveloping the downtown area, which by seven o'clock the streets are rolled up and it's dead in the past, we had citizens and organized groups and what have you who want, first of all, always want Evanston [Illinois] to be the same no matter what, even if it's dying, but they all had their ideas of what we were doing to the city and how we were ruining, ruining the city and so forth.  And it was drastic, but something had to be done.  Evanston had the highest taxes on the North Shore.  For all I'm at--for all I know, it may be the highest taxes per capita of any other community in the Chicagoland area.  Evanston has no industry to speak of.  In the past, all your box stores and everything, after they built Old Orchard [Shopping Center, later Westfield Old Orchard, Skokie, Illinois], moved out.  You had to do something.  We tried with what was known as a research park, you know, sort of like the ones they have in California, where research and development and so forth.  But we never, that really never got off the ground.  After dealing with consultants and, and urban planners and so forth, we were advised that the best route to take was to create residential entertainment complexes within the downtown city--of, of the city--to bring it back to, to have this renaissance.  And that's what we pursued, and we ran into walls of opposition.  But--
Speaker 1: Now just to back up a second, what is a residential entertainment complex?
Speaker 2: Well, meaning that we wanted more residents living in the downtown area.  We want housing, be it condos or whatever, we needed more of that, and we needed entertainment in the way of food or activities that would bring people to the downtown--
Speaker 1: Theater--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --so they're not joined together.  They just--it's just that--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --within this area--
Speaker 1: So, theater, movies--
Speaker 2: Theaters--
Speaker 1: --maybe sports stuff (unclear)--
Speaker 2: --as restaurants, you name it--
Speaker 1: --yeah, restaurants.
Speaker 2: --that, that were a good fit.  That's what I mean by that.  So, they, they were individually done, not a complex, you know, here the--here's a condo and inside you got a movie theater.  No, it wasn't that way.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: The complex itself would, would consist of those kinds of components.  But in the face of great resistance, we got that done.  And I am glad to say today that nationwide we are looked upon as a model as how to do redevelopment.  And having been a part, I am really, I really feel good.  We have people coming from all over the world to see how we've done in it.  If you go Downtown Evanston now, it's alive; it's vibrant.  We've got some great architects.  Has everyone been a real winner?  There are some that I'm not proud of, that--but if you can say on a scale of success of one to ten, and you're comfortably a seven or an eight, you've done a good job.  Because the ideal, which is ten, you're not gonna get there.  You might get there with individual components.  You might say, you know, [Ludwig] Mies van der Rohe is a--this is an excellent example of, of a glass building, but all of Chicago [Illinois] is not Mies van der Rohe.  So we've got our Mies van der Rohes not--I mean that not literally; I'm just using it as an example.  And we've got some that were basically more Carl Sandburg, you know, so.  But on a scale of one to ten, what we've done, the first year that our theaters open downtown--now mind you, Old Orchard had taken all of that business from us, had over a million visitors.  Now imagine what happens when a million visitors come to your town to see a movie.  And you know it's not just Evanstonians, because we are not--there're not that many of us.  Then they stay and buy dinner, and then they stay and buy other things or visit other places.  How that revitalizes your downtown and how it has that domino effect, is, is just phenomenal.  So far, it is going so well so far, that I get calls every day from New York or California--"we're looking for 50,000 square feet."  We just don't have it.  Evanston roughly is eight miles long and two or three miles wide, and most of it is residential; and 40 percent of it is not for profit, i.e., churches, universities, schools and what have you, maybe even higher than 40 percent.  But I mean that just shows you the success story, where you got people who aren't even from here, just have heard of the success story.  "We'd like to have a presence in Evanston.  Have you got 50,000 square feet?"  "No, we don't.  I'd love to have you, but we don't."  I could--I'd be hard pressed to find you 10,000 square feet, depending on what it is you wanna do, so.  In some instances, we don't do, we don't just raze blocks, like they do in Chicago, and then built--no, no, that'd never fly in Evanston.  Some of these homes are so old you wouldn't believe it.
Story_ID: 176303
Speaker 1: Just on that note, Evanston [Illinois] was one of the major depots for the Underground Railroad in the, in the 19th century is what, what I've heard of it.
Speaker 2: Well, I am sure it was.
Speaker 1: 'Cause I know a lot of these older homes were--
Speaker 2: I'm sure it was.  But what really, what really brought black folks to Evanston was that--and particularly from one particular area in South Carolina.  So many of these black Evanstonians who have been here for generations, many of them are related, but they all came from the same little area in South Carolina, Pickens County I think it is, but I'm not quite sure which county it is.  But they were brought here as domestics.  And from there, many started their own businesses; we started hospitals; we started everything we needed in a segregated society.  And the only black folks you saw on Sheridan Road, or on, on Lake Avenue, or over on the beach were those pushing the prams for the babies or, or with the horse and carriage.  So, I think it's kind of ironic that in 1980 the first black family to ever live on Sheridan Road moved in in 1980, and that was us, I mean, so.  But Evanston has, always had a, a liberal side, an urbane side, an educated side.  And fortunately, that prevails and comes through loudly and clearly in Evanston.  We are probably, for a city of this size, one of the most diverse cities you'll ever see.  And the one nice thing about it, which it really is interesting to me, when I grew up in Chicago [Illinois], what I called my neighborhood was probably as far as you could walk.  You know, that was your neighborhood.  Evanston isn't that big, so you can have a mansion that cost a million dollars over here, and less than maybe even a matter of blocks away, you've got modest home with--and that, and that's just the way Evanston is.  So, I tell people all the time, when I'm talking to citizens or people from the various wards--"Well, I live in ward five, or I live in ward one," whatever--I say you know what, and when I was growing up, my neighborhood was the size of Evanston.  I mean, so when you say you live way over in, in--and any, anybody who's, who's able and mobile can walk the length of Evanston probably in an hour's time, you know what I mean (laughter).  You can, you can--and if you're going west, you can be out of Evanston in minutes maybe.  So, it, it's always interesting to me when you may say there's a black community in Evanston.  But if that community is only blocks away from downtown, we're all here together, so we all better learn how to live and so forth.  We have a--we can't leave Chicago out of the mix because we have--we're one of the few communities that have rail transportation that goes through it, the, the Chicago L [train] goes through Evanston and what have you.  It brings it trouble; it also takes trouble out too, but that's not here nor there.  I'm not making that, that point.  But depending on which edge of Evanston you live on, you tend to adopt the culture of who your neighbor is.  For instance, those people living in Southeast Asia--Evanston--I almost said Southeast Asia again--Southeast Evanston, tend to mirror more what Chicago looks like.  If you live in Northwest Evanston--mind you, now we're only talking a few miles--you mirror what Wilmette [Illinois] looks like.  If you live where I live here, which we call Skevanston, you mirror what Skokie [Illinois] looks like.  So, you do get these different flavors of the community.
Story_ID: 176304
Speaker 1: And in the midst of it we're known as a town and gown, as you know, kind of city [Evanston, Illinois].  You've got Northwestern University [Evanston, Illinois], which is one of the largest employers.  We have a love/hate relationship, but we manage to get along well.  No, because the city likes Evanston and Evanston likes--I mean the, the, the university likes Evanston, couldn't be in a nicer town.  And the, and the city likes them as Western.  But Northwestern pays no taxes, and it covers a lot of ground, and it uses up services like police and fire and those kinds of things, and water and what have you.  Now I'm not saying they don't pay water taxes, but I mean as far as real estate taxes are concerned.  And Northwestern says yeah, but we hire a lot of Evanstonians, and we're good for the city.  So it's this, this ever--never ending head bumping.  And depending on, on how vehement you are, either you're rabidly Northwestern hater or city hater, or you, you're just hey, that's part of the--that's why this city is so eccentric.  I don't know where I come down on that because there are good points that can be made by both sides.  But we're inextricably joined; we'll never separate, so we'd better find a way to, to, to continue getting along.  It's been getting along now for well over a hundred years.  We gotta find a way to continue doing it.  But what happens is Northwestern keeps acquiring more property.  They're not buying it.  People are leaving it.  You've got a lot of Northwestern alumni living in Evanston.  When they die they'll leave their mansion, their house and whatever.  That goes off the tax roll.  That hurts the city.  So, and if the city tries to come up with, with ways to prevent that, then Northwestern is saying we're discriminating or this and that.  We're involved in a lawsuit right now.  Hopefully it'll work itself out because the neighbors are adjoining Northwestern--one part of Northwestern wanted to create a historic district.  Well, Northwestern fought that tooth and nail because they own property in that area.  And if it becomes an historic district, they can never do anything with it but leave it as a, as the way it is.  And they may want to make dormitories or something one day, so.  We're--and they think the city was behind that, which it wasn't.  But (laughter) those are the kinds of things we get embroiled with.  Every day I have no idea what I'll be facing when I get to my office.  I'll get people calling for: can you tell me who owns such and such a--no, why don't you call them.  I can't--I mean people think their government knows everything.  We get people calling: well, it snowed today.  That's how, that's the kind of culture, democratic culture we have here in Evanston.  I'm just trying to paint a picture to, to--I mean it's across the board.  And you can't be rude with citizens, so you simply say well, maybe you might wanna turn your radio on to, to--or your television--and give 'em a station--and they give weather reports every 10 minutes or so.  But I mean they, they look to their government to, to answer all their questions.  And I saw a deer crossing the street.  Send someone out to make sure it doesn't get hurt (laughter), you know.  You've got the planning department.  Are you sure you want this (laughter).  But I enjoy it, and I think it's a wonderful way to wind up my working career.  I've had a good life.  I mean, I mean in terms of material things and what have you, and those don't interest me anymore.  So this is--if this is a contribution that I can make in helping Evanston become--and be, be as well as become even better, I think that's, that's a great legacy.
Story_ID: 176305
Speaker 1: In fact, my son [Morris "Dino" Robinson, Jr.], who lives here in Evanston [Illinois] also, I mean I have more friends who are white wanting to recruit him to run for mayor.  And, and he could if he wanted to.  He's that well liked.  I said we must have left some kind of imprint here in this city, you know.
Speaker 2: Now this is the graphic artist or--
Speaker 1: Yes, my--yeah.
Speaker 2: So, so you got, did you have one son or two?
Speaker 1: I have two sons.
Speaker 2: Two, okay.
Speaker 1: I have another son who is probably going to be moving back to Evanston.  He misses it.  He lives in Bolingbrook [Illinois] right now, he's, his intentions were always to come back.  So, and I think he's making noises about doing that real soon.  So, it, it drag--it, you know, it draws you back; no matter how far away you go it draws you back.
Story_ID: 176306
Speaker 1: We never set out intentionally to move to Evanston [Illinois].  We, we moved to Glenview [Illinois] in 1973, and we lived there for seven years.  And it was a small home, and my wife [Margot Robinson] said you know, we probably need to go someplace where there's more diversity.  And I agreed with her, and I, I--
Speaker 2: 'Cause Glenview was all-white basically.
Speaker 1: Primarily at that time.  It's not anymore though, but at that time it was.  So, she said I wanna move to Evanston.  I said fine.  I didn't really necessarily want to move to Evanston.  But I said I'll tell you what, we'll move to Evanston if you can find a place that's no more than two blocks from the lake.  And I knew that was gonna be impossible because we wouldn't be able to afford it.  I, I should never underestimate my wife because she was tenacious, and she found this house.  She said I want you to come and see it.  I said where is it?  She said on Sheridan Road.  I said why do you look on--you know we can't buy on--she said just come look at it.  And when we got there--this is funny--Mitchell had been appointed a federal judge and had moved to Washington, D.C.  He left the house with a, a friend to take care of all legal matters and what have you.  The friend had rented out the floors to some Israelis who had been used to living in a kibbutz.  And the house was just--I mean it had pigeons all over it.  I'll never forget, on the upstairs window a pair of boots were sitting on a pile of pigeon dung.  And we went in to see the house, and here's this one, he couldn't speak English.  He's laying on a couch in the middle of the floor.  And the house just needed so much.  And we looked, and I'm sure, I'm, I'm just sure, and my mind--I'm sure my wife was very discouraged then.  When we were leaving, I'm just smiling 'cause I didn't want any parts of this, even though I liked the location.  She said Morris, I want this house, get it.  That was that.  And so, I'll never forget, we, we made an offer far below what Mikva was asking for, but it was the best offer that they had ever gotten.  So his power of attorney accepted the offer.  And we went in and we did quite a bit of renovation and what have you.  Mikva had some furniture he left there that--these people had cats and dogs and everything, and it was just so--and when we moved in, we had every--we, we, we got permission from the, from the power of attorney to move the stuff out 'cause we wanted to strip the floors and, and do the floors.  And I said--he said--I said can we sit this in the alley because it's garbage?  And he said go right ahead.  And we sit--he said no, no, Mikva is offering that to the Salvation Army, so we sat it in the backyard and called the Salvation Army to come and get it.  And I'll never forget the day we were moving in the Salvation Army came and he says, look, we don't accept stuff like this.  You have to just--I said but that's not mine.  You didn't make that arrangement with me.  You made it with Abner Mikva, and you told him you were gonna take it, so I think it's your responsibility to take it.  And they, they took it, but they dumped it.  So at the closing, Mikva says--first of all, he's yelling at his power of attorney, but he's steadily signing all the documents 'cause he wanted the money I'm sure.  And he says and about that furniture.  And I said, I said, Judge Mikva, I'm gonna be honest with you.  That furniture was filthy.  It was garbage; even the, the Salvation Army didn't want to take it.  You, you know, you--now they took it, and you can put down whatever deduction you want to take on your tax, but I'm here to tell you it was garbage.  I didn't even wanna touch it without gloves.  And he was just steaming, you know, but, but it all worked out well.  And when we left, when, when we moved out of that house, my kids grew up there, and we had a wonderful time.  We used to give a July, 4th of July party.  I had a big deck built, and we'd have sometimes as many as 200 people there.  And the kids would walk through my neighbor's yard, and they'd go swimming beach and come back, and we'd turn the water hose on them and--(unclear) that water never gets warm, Larry.  So, my kids would run out the backdoor, and run on through their yard, and jump in that water, and it would be so--and I'd go in, and as soon as you--if it gets to your knees, it's so cold it looks your knees.  On a 90 degree day like this that water is ice cold, but my kids used to just run out.  And that was a good living experience for them.  So they, they had a good time over there.  They hated the--my son now, when my son was in his, in his sophomore year in school down at U of I [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Champaign, Illinois], we realized that we didn't need to be paying all these taxes for this house.  And the reason we knew it is I have my family room on the second floor.  And I had been two hours watching television, and I heard this noise downstairs.  And my wife was there, and I said when did you get here?  She said I've been here.  We didn't even know each other was in the house.  I said it's time to, it's time to go.  We, we don't need to be paying all these taxes.  So when my son came home from school and came here, I could see that this--he said you sold the house (laughter).  To this day he misses that house.  I said yeah, we sold it.  That house was a, a money pit I mean, so--and, and we were changing our lifestyles anyway, so it was the best thing that could have happened.  But it was a good living experience.
Story_ID: 177449
Speaker 1: Now, now you have a number of hobbies too that you seem to--well, you're a collector, it seems; it seems that you--I mean you've got a fairly large telescope we seen in the other room, you know; and you're into history.  You said you've been into history--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --since the late '60s [1960s].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: You know, tell, tell us about--
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: --us about some of your--
Speaker 2: I just have so any interests, and I try to pursue as many as I can because, first of all, when I retire I don't want to have nothing to do, okay, that's one thing.  But my wife [Margot Robinson] and I started collecting right after we got married.  We, we love art, so we, we started collecting originals and, and so forth.  If you had asked me to name some of the paintings, I wouldn't be able to.  We knew what we liked, and when we saw something we liked we bought it. So we, we--I, I collect paperweights.  I think my oldest brother, Phil, got me into that.  He was, my, my oldest brother is the single person that had the most profound, living person that had the most profound impact on my life.  He taught me so many things.  I, I know it sounds like I'm boasting, but I truly mean it when I say my oldest brother was absolutely brilliant, and it was recognized by, by anybody, all his teachers and what have you.  Unfortunately, he died early in life.  He died when he was only fifty.
Speaker 1: What was his name again?
Speaker 2: Phil, Phil, and I miss him.
Speaker 1: Phil Robinson?
Speaker 2: Right.  I miss him today very much so.  But he knew, he knew so much.  He got me interested in, he got me interested in Broadway musicals when I was just a kid.  Today I sit on the board of the Light Opera Works, which produces some of the finest Broadway musicals in the Chicagoland [Illinois] area.  He got me interested in science.  He bought--I changed my birthday because of him, and I got away with it.  My birthday is really January 23rd.  He brought my brother that's two years older than me a microscope for Christmas.  There's a big difference in our ages, and he was working.  And I--he didn't get me one, and I wanted one so badly he said I'll get you one for your birthday.  And, and like I said, I was--he, he was interested in science, and that's why he bought my, my, my other brother the microscope.  So I knew my brother was in, in January, and I must have been, I'm gonna say a the most nine or ten years old.  And each day it just seemed like an eternity until I would get that microscope.  So finally, he said now when's your birthday again?  And I said January 20th, 'cause I, I, I had to say twenty-something, so I made it as, the lowest twenty I could get it, if you know what I mean.  And, and from that day on I have always used January 20th as my birthday.  So, my wife tells then that makes your astrological sign wrong.  I said I, I don't believe in it anyway, so, so it's okay (laughter).

Speaker 1: But any rate, from there I got interest--I've always been interested in science, so if you were to look in my den you'd find the microscope, not the one he bought, but you will find a microscope.  I like optical things.  I collect cameras.  I've got some very, very fine cameras.  You might appreciate, Scott [Stearns].  Have you ever seen the Bolex camera?
Speaker 2: You've got a wind up Bolex in there.
Speaker 1: Yeah--
Speaker 2: I saw that, yeah.
Speaker 1: --I've got one of those.  I've got Rolleiflexes.  I've got--I collect them.  I also collect watches.  The name sounds horrible, a horologist, but (laughter), but I love watches.  I, I call them time pieces.  I don't call them watches.  But my wife [Margot Robinson] calls me a, a watch snob, in that--no offense, I don't like Quartz watches.  I only like mechanical watches, and so she calls me--and I says it's just a collector, just like collecting paperweights.  If I was to find one with a flaw in it, I'd give it away.  That's not true with everything, you know.  But, but you just want--once you set it in your mind what the standard is you set for what you collect, you tend not to deviate from that standard, unless it's so old or whatever that, the, the, the deviation only adds to it, if you follow what I mean.  But a paperweight that's been dropped and chipped, unless it's a hundred years old, I, I don't, I don't want it, you know.  But--and all my paperweights aren't old.  Don't get me wrong, but that's just the way I am.  And astronomy has always interested me and I guess maybe from a, from the time I was in high school.  But I'm sure you've gone out to a night sky and looked up and just felt so insignificant.  And your mind, it boggles the mind just to think of just how vast space is.  You can't fathom something that goes on forever.  You just--your mind can't conceive it, but yet you understand it, if you follow me.  And so when you look up and you see those stars, or you see those planets, it's just, maybe in another time and age I might have wanted to be an astronaut.  But, so the best, next best thing to do is just look at 'em, and like I say, you can even use a simple pair of binoculars and just have a ball.  Go out in your backyard or on your porch.  You don't have to go anyplace fancy.  In a city it can be tough, admittedly, but it doesn't take very much to go to the lakefront, for instance, and just train your eyes on anything.  And before you know it, you start making out Ursa Major and Ursa Minor and you know, and the, the Big Dipper.  And you can--and if you watch it long enough, you can see how, as the world turns or whatever, the Big Dipper, which originally looks like a dipper, and then it spreads out and becomes something else.  And, and I think probably it dates back to a very early visit to the, to the--
Speaker 2: Planetarium.
Speaker 1: --planetarium.  And I don't know if you remember this.  A machine they used to have it just fascinated me, this--that with--do the stars and what--I think retired it.  They have something knew now that's much--that was called a zyscope [ph.] or something.  I can't remember the exact word of it.  But I got more pleasure looking at the machine as it was doing the stars than, than looking at the ceiling.  I've always liked gadgets.  I am a gadget man.  So, if it's gadgetry and if it's got optics with it, I love it.

Speaker 1: When you look back at, at your life, and as a, as a banker, and with the City of Evanston [Illinois], and other things and other volunteer activities and so forth, what would you see at this point as your legacy?
Speaker 2: My sons.  I think that yet another generation has gone by, or, or has come to, to the fore, that has been contributors rather than detractors from, from our society.  Now, I'm not saying that there record can go on forever.  I'd love to see it do that, but I am so pleased that, that wife and I have two sons who have grown up to be fine young examples of men.  I didn't say black man.  I said of men, because I think they exemplify what every parent would want their, their children to be.  And they--we've always had high expectations and standards for, for our sons.  And I won't tell them that, but they have exceeded mine tremendously.  So, I, I would think that's it.  And I--now, how does that read down to me is that my wife and I must have done something right most of the time.  I'm not saying we didn't make mistakes.  I'm sure we did.  There is no book that can truly tell you how to raise children, but the, the, the test is in the, is in the pudding, as they say.  I don't know if I got that saying right, but it's how they turned out, because we are responsible for how they turned out as much as they are.  And so maybe that's, that's seems too obvious to say your children are your legacy, but I remember what my dad told me before he died.  He says you know, son, really, the last thing and the only thing that I really gave you was my name.  And keep it good; keep it well.  And, and so that legacy was handed from my dad to me, and I believe that we've handed that same legacy to, to our sons.  So, that's most important to me.  Like I mentioned to you earlier, I think we've had a good life, and not that I'm talking that it's over (laughter).  I'm not--I hope not.  And there are a lot of other things I wanna see and do.  But, but when it comes down to it--and, and maybe I'm a bit philosophical after, for being a cancer survivor--you really learn what's important when you're face with something that can be life threatening.  And it's not the material things, and it's not--you may like your collections, whatever, but buddy, it's all staying behind when you go.  The only thing that you're leaving behind that can still have an impact is your family and your children, if you have children, or how you lived; that you had an impact on others and, and how they live.  And that could be negative or positive, and I like to think it's been positive for us.
Story_ID: 177452
Speaker 1: This is a question we always ask, and we, we always ask it in this way.  What are some of your hopes and concerns for the black community?
Speaker 2: My biggest concern right now is that our black youth have not embraced in large enough numbers, 'cause I don't wanna speak absolutely, the value of getting an education and striving to succeed.  And that word succeed is a loaded word.  Succeed does not meant in terms of just dollars and cents.  I'm not--succeed in whatever it is you think you want to do, but take that advantage to do it.  I drive down the street and I see so many young black kids hanging out, and I can see clearly what influences them.  And I ask myself how many, how many artists and how many medical people and how many--and it boils down to the, to the point that we are not providing competition.  And you might ask what do I mean by that.  I don't mean it in a sports (unclear).  Right now we are in one of the worst economic slumps we've ever been in.  Every job opening that's out there somebody is competing for it.  Because we haven't in enough numbers done the things we need to do, we're not in competition for those jobs.  So if you're not in competition for those jobs, you can't get in those jobs and take it to the next level.  And as, as other leaders, civil leaders have said and so forth, we know our kids can learn.  We know they can.  They can memorize a rap song.  Our ears are not attune to it.  I, for one, don't know what they're saying half the time.  That's not a negative statement.  That's just a fact.  But these kids not only know what they're saying, but they hear it a couple of times and they know it by heart--tell me you can't learn--and can sing along with you, and I mean from the earliest ages they can do that.  I would love to see that same effort.  Somewhere along the way, a lot of that's been lost.  And a whole new culture has cropped up in its place.  I was raised in a house where there was never without books.  I go in houses now, even in, in, in some educated people's home, I don't a book anywhere.  I see lots of nice knickknacks and things, but I don't see a book.  I may see a magazine.  But may, maybe I, maybe it sounds like I'm being, I'm getting on a soapbox or whatever, but somewhere along the line what happened to the next Benny Mays, who, who went to Morehouse and made it an institution, who walked out of a farm field at 12 years old because he thirsted for knowledge, and set standards?  I have so many friends who went to the House, went to Morehouse, who remember Benny Mays [Dr. Benjamin Mays], who would tell him if you don't know it now, it's too late, test time, you know what I mean, those kind of standards.  What ever happened to--we can't blame it all on poverty.  What ever happened to--the, the vast majority of the black middle class today came out of abject poverty, so it's not just poverty.  What happened to that desire, that thirst, that, that hunger to say I want to do better, I want to do things, I want other than the street life that seems to be taking over?  That has its place.  I had my fun in the streets.  I'm not, I'm not saying that that doesn't have a place.  But when it becomes the primary focus, how did this thing get turned upside down.  And so my concern now is that for every parent that raises a successful child--and again, remember my definition is not necessarily making a ton of money.  Successful child can, can be someone who's just living a good life, and trying to be a good neighbor, and be a good parent, and, and producing something.  But for every child that's like that, I, I'm afraid that there are too many that are gonna be incarcerated, that won't live to see twenty-one.
Story_ID: 177453
Speaker 1: We do some mentoring with various schools that have real problem areas in it, and I'll never forget the teachers are asked to leave the room so we could just talk with the children freely.  And you start talking with--and you hear some of this, the stories that they tell.  I asked a question: How many of you know anybody that you knew personally that's been shot?  Every hand's gone up.  How many of you know of someone who has a gun?  If not every hand goes up, many of 'em goes up.  How many of you know dope pushers, and what do you think of that?  'Cause I never and, and lead them on.  I will ask questions that make them speak.  So what do you think of that?  And they'll say well, you know, my brother's this, or my--I know, or his--my cousin or whatever.  And I said, what do you think of that life?  Well, you can make good money.  You can get a lot of money, and that's what--and I said yeah, but how, do you think you can do that forever?  And when you hear a kid who's twelve or thirteen years old say I'll be dead before I, before I'm twenty, I know--'cause that's the life they're seeing.  And probably statics will bear it out, that those who cannot be swayed away from that one way or another are either gonna be dead, or incarcerated, or hospitalized, or whatever the case may be, and the numbers are just too great.  And I don't know what it's gonna take.  I hear people say well, most of the role models have moved out of the city or out of the community or whatever.  I don't know how much water that holds.  They see role models.  They hear--and, and what about the generation before them who didn't have role models.  They--that desire was there, so my concern and, and, and worry is I'm worried about the children, I really am.
Story_ID: 177454
Speaker 1: Sir, how would you like to be remembered?  This is a little bit different from legacy.
Speaker 2: As a good father, and a good neighbor, and a good friend.
Speaker 1: All right, well thank you, sir.
Speaker 2: That's it?
Speaker 1: Yep, that's (laughter)--
Speaker 2: Oh, okay (laughter).
Story_ID: 177455
Speaker 1: Okay, that's me, Morris [Robinson], Sr., and my wife Margot [Robinson].  And that picture's about 1987 or '88 [1988], I would think.  And we were probably dressed going to, to an affair downtown.  And that's in our old house on Sheridan Road [Evanston, Illinois].
VIDEOGRAPHER:  Okay, go ahead with this one.
Speaker 1: Okay, this, this is an ad picture of myself and my son, Morris ["Dino" Robinson], Jr.--we call him Dino--which we used with various advertising campaigns when we had our business together.  We thought a good positive photo would look good on certain collateral pieces that we, we used to promote our business.
VIDEOGRAPHER:  All right.  Larry could you lower those clips so they don't stick up above? Thank you.
Speaker 1: That's a picture of me shortly after I was commissioned as second lieutenant in the, in Fort Sill, Oklahoma, many years ago, although it seems like it was just yesterday.
VIDEOGRAPHER:  All right, next.
Speaker 1: About 1963?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's about--no, no--
Speaker 1: Sixty-seven [1967], sixty--
Speaker 2: --around 1967, right.
Speaker 1: Now this goes back to about 1964 or '65' [1965], when I was at Luther College in Decorah, Iowa.  This was their version of the old Whiffenpoof, singing choral group, only it was called in Norwegian Dollance Corps.  And I sang tenor, and that--we put on a number of productions, and those were the guys who--we had just performed 'The Pirates of Penzance.'  And of course, you can easily spot me in that one (laughter).  That wasn't the Pirates.  That was 'H.M.S. Pinafore.'  That's what it was. That's what it was, yeah.
Speaker 2: This is graduation from the first black school I ever went to.  I'm in the second row, second from the left.  That was at Tennyson, Alfred Lord Tennyson Grammar School [Chicago, Illinois].  And that was the graduating class.  And Mrs. Lewis [ph.] is in the second row, the very first one on the right.  She was an excellent teacher.
VIDEOGRAPHER:  Okay, next.
Speaker 2: This is me, and I think the, the year is on that.  I think it looks like it's 1956.  Again, there is not much trouble picking, picking us out.  And the tie that I'm wearing was typical of my mother.  She would have us wear a shirt and tie on, at the drop of a hat on any occasion.  And back in those days, you, if you notice, when they took class pictures, most of the young men did have, have ties on.
VIDEOGRAPHER:  They didn't really expose for you, did they?
Speaker 2: Oh no. (laughter)
Speaker 1: No, they didn't.
VIDEOGRAPHER:  Okay, next.
Speaker 1: That's me in, I'm going to say in the late '70's [1970s], as a young bank executive at First National Bank of Chicago, plaids and stripes.  Someone should have told me something then (laughter).
VIDEOGRAPHER:  Okay, next.
Speaker 1: That's me as in my dress blues in Keogh [ph.], Italy.  I had just attended a, an affair with the Italian air force, where the Italian general asked if I was from Morocco of all places, because he had not seen the dress blue uniform.  And, and that's about 19--
VIDEOGRAPHER:  October '68' [1968], it says on the board there.  Okay, next.
Speaker 1: Sixty-eight [1968], right, sixty-eight [1968], right.
Speaker 2: When in the, while I was an executive in the bank, we, of course, supported many civic activities and fundraisers.  And that's me on the, on the right, and that's about 1986.  I was a, probably an assistant vice president at the time.  In the middle is Nancy McKeever, who was the chair of this particular affair, and I can't remember exactly what it was.  And I don't remember who the lady is on the right, but that was in 1986.
VIDEOGRAPHER:  Hold on.  Okay, next.
Speaker 2: This is a picture of my father-in-law, Colonel John T. Rose, who was the battalion commander of the old Eighth Illinois Regiment that was housed out of the armory on Cottage Grove [Chicago, Illinois].  And he's standing there with his--the chief executive, who was at the time governor, Governor Otto Kerner.
VIDEOGRAPHER:  Okay, next.
Speaker 2: They didn't expose for him too much either did they?  Oh, that's, that's my father-in-law at, at a younger age, probably during World War II.  He landed in, on Omaha Beach in World War II on the second day.  And he said it was the, the first day was the worst, but the second day was no picnic either.  He was a young, young major or captain at the time.  I can't remember which one.
VIDEOGRAPHER:  Okay, next.
Speaker 2: Is this him as well?
Speaker 1: That's him as well, and we might be getting tired of it.  That's him as a first lieutenant early in his military career.
Speaker 2: (Off-camera discussion)
Speaker 1: Oh, that's my father-in-law leading the troops on, on a State Street parade while he was still commanding the battalion.  I don't know what year it is, but I know it was the early '60s [1960s] probably.
VIDEOGRAPHER:  Okay, next.
Speaker 1: That's my mother, bless her heart.  I'm gonna say that picture was taken easily 50 years ago, longer than that, probably in the '40s [1940s], judging from the bouffant hairstyle and the, and the kind of clothes she's wearing.
VIDEOGRAPHER:  Sure.  Next.
Speaker 1: That's my mother and father, and that probably was taken in the '50s [1950s], my father, who is deceased.  I, I, I think they were at a church function.  As you can see, he was not a, not a big man, and, and I think I took after him in, in many ways.
VIDEOGRAPHER:  'Kay, next.
Speaker 1: (Off-camera discussion)
Speaker 2: Shortly after being commission, they took pictures of all the new butter bars, as they--as we were called.  And that was probably 1967.
VIDEOGRAPHER:  Okay, next.
Speaker 2: She's gonna kill me for this, but that's my mother-in-law, Marge Rose.  My wife's maiden name is Rose.  And hence, you can see why neither one of my boys was named after him.  We have a habit--we have a, a tradition of naming children after forbearers, but I just couldn't see naming one of the boys Rose something or other.  So, I didn't want 'em fighting every day.  But anyway, that's Margery Rose.  My father-in-law is John Rose.  And this is what I call her Dorothy Dandridge period.  She gets angry when I do it.  But they were an elegant couple.  You should see them in their dress blues.
Speaker 1: This is a photograph of my in-laws.  That's Lieutenant John Rose and Mrs. Mar--Mrs. Rose, Margery Rose, and that's their wedding day.
VIDEOGRAPHER:  Next, please.
Speaker 1: This is a, a photograph of my Boule [Sigma Pi Phi Fraternity].  It's--there are far too many people in there for me to try and name, although the names are listed there at the bottom.  But you'll see I'm on the right-hand side, third from the right, seated on the arm of, of the chair.  And we were having a, that was an induction ceremony.  We took in some new members that day.  One is Terry Phillips, who is on the left side, far right in the back, who is--I put my hand in the way, didn't I--who is the son-in-law of Leon Robinson of the bus company.  Next to him is Dr. Arthur Body [ph.].  On the next, at the left, seated on the armchair is Dr. Calvin Hall.  He's very well known in Chicago.  Coming across to the right again, this gentleman sitting on the table who just recently passed, that's Lemon [ph.] Columbus MacMillan, II.
VIDEOGRAPHER:  Look in the (unclear).  Can you describe what that is?
Speaker 1: That's the, that's our, our, that's, that's a sphinx.  In the, in the ancient days, Boule meant a gathering of community leaders.  And their names were put in an earthen jar that's being guarded by a, a lion with the head of a beautiful woman, and that is our, that is our emblem, a winged lion with the head of a, of a beautiful woman.  But I was gonna mention that Lemon MacMillan, seated prominently upfront here, just passed a few weeks ago, and what a tremendous person he was.  That's somebody that--
VIDEOGRAPHER:  Go ahead please.
Speaker 1: This is a photograph that was taken on the tenth anniversary of our Boule, the founding of our Boule here on the North Shore.  And this was a--I, at the time, I think I was, oh, I was the president-elect.  And for all who attended, the, the guests and the members received this commemorative frame with the, with the photograph of yourself and your bride.  And this was in, this was in the year 2000.  As you can see, the hair is getting noticeably grayer (laughter).
