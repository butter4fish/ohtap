 Finchum  G. Jones  Finchum  B. Jones  G. Jones  B. Jones  G. Jones  B. Jones  Today is May 3, 2013. My name is Tanya Finchum, along with Juliana  Nykolaiszyn. We   re with the Oklahoma State University Library. We   re  here in Hennessey to speak with Greta and Bill Jones about their  Centennial Farm. This is part of our Oklahoma Centennial Farm  Families Project. So, thank you for having us today.  You   re very welcome. We   re thrilled to have you here.  Let   s start with having you tell us how your family came to have this  land.  Her grandfather purchased it January 12, 1897. He paid  700 for it. They  got married the following year. He bought it the year before they got  married, so that is where they started their family. They raised five  children on that farm. Their dad is number two, right?  Number two.  He lived his entire life on that farm.  At the time he got married, he bought the farm from grandpa and  grandma and he had never lived anywhere else.  He bought it, like I say, for  700. Then it went to her dad, who bought it  from them in 1933, which is right after the    Dirty Thirties.    I don   t  know for sure, but I think he paid the note off because they were one of  the first ones that got an FHA loan. They were just about to lose  everything, and her grandmother wrote some congressman   I don   t  know who   told him the shape they were in, and they needed help. The  story goes, whoever was in this area, they got a message to go out and  make this lady a loan. Wasn   t anything about having to approve it or  5  Finchum  B. Jones  Finchum  B. Jones  anything, just to go make the loan, and they did. (Laughter) They were  very staunch democrats so they felt like FDR saved the land. After he  passed away, the land went to Greta and her brother. We bought his half  out, so we have everything except five acres that he sold. So we   ve still  got 155 acres of the original land.  That   s pretty good. That  700 was a lot of money back in that year.  It was. Very, very much. His father was a doctor in Lacey. Well, the  town is gone now. But in that time, it was a fair community going. Her  grandmother   s side of the family ran the Lacey Store. They put an ad in  the Kansas City Star that this town needed a doctor, and to contact them.  His house burned up in Illinois, so they moved here. That   s how they got  started. They had the store there, and the doctor just got close to each  other, the two kids got together and got married. Been here ever since.  (Laughs)  The rest is history. What did they originally farm on the land?  Well, at the time they bought it, I don   t know how much, but most of  this was in Blackjacks. The crops at that time, cotton was the cash crop.  They raised all the feed for their animals on the farm. You didn   t go to  town to buy the feed. You raised it. So they had cotton for a cash crop.  They raised oats primarily for the horses, corn for the pigs and the  horses and the cattle. At that time, there weren   t too many cattle in this  area. Everybody had chickens. They had hogs and their horses. So this is  the way most of it was. We counted up the other day, I think there was  eight different fields on that quarter section of land. They had their  different crops. You talk about, now, rotating them but they want to  rotate 160 acres at a time. It was interesting to see how they did it.  Of course, that is what caused the great Dust Bowl. Everybody plowed  the ground up and it blew away. Out west of here, they didn   t have the  trees. Here, we did, but we still lost a lot of land. That   s when the  shelterbelts were put in, in the    30s. We built one of the few shelterbelts  that are still left. You definitely see how they worked. You go down  there and there is probably four to five foot of sand stopped inside those  shelterbelts.  As far as the different crops, like I say, that was pretty well it until they  got more land cleared. They cleared a lot of land and sold the wood for  firewood. The Lacey Store there was, like I say, the biggest store from  here to the Texas line. Probably 80 to 90 percent of their business was  barter. I can show you the book where they   d go in and take a rick of  wood and sell it for about twenty cents, but that would buy their  groceries. People from the other side of the river would come over and  6  G. Jones  B. Jones  Finchum  B. Jones  Finchum  B. Jones  G. Jones  B. Jones  buy wood and trade for something else. So much of the stuff was barter,  then. There wasn   t the cash.  They started growing wheat when they had bigger fields. I didn   t know  until recently   her dad and her granddad fixed up an old Chevrolet car  and put a box on it, something kind of like a pickup. This is how they  hauled their wheat for several years. Of course, they started with the  team and wagon. It   s ten miles to Hennessey so that would take a day to  take one load   fifty, sixty bushels of wheat to town. Well, then they got  the car. They did that about the time the combines came in. Now, they  haul in a thousand bushels at a time with a semi-truck, instead of forty or  fifty.  A lot of changes.  My dad worked in the elevator and he told me one time how many loads  they dumped. It was just unreal. It was a four-wheeled trailer made out  of an old car body, and pulled it with another car.  They had to find a way to do things, didn   t they?  That   s it. And they did. They come out with the pickup   your Model T  pickup probably wouldn   t hold fifteen bushels. (Laughter) It   s changed  so much. Then everybody got trucks. The biggest change was the  hydraulic lift in the truck. You can go in and raise the bed and dump it.  You didn   t have to scoop it out. Like I say, gone on to the semi-trucks  and they haul up to a thousand bushels, and sometimes a little over. So  that has made a big change.  In the early days, what were some of the buildings that were on the  property?  Well, they had the barn. They had kind of, I   d say, a lean-to shed. Just a  shade, more than anything, for their hogs. You always had a chicken  house.  There were two chicken houses down there.  Oh, I don   t know just when they started milking in this area, but by the     50s, just about every farm here milked a few cows. The truck would  come by a couple times a week and pick the milk up in five and ten  gallon cans. Earlier, they used to take their cream in town, cream and  butter. They would take it to town and sell it or trade it for groceries.  This was going on in the    50s. Now, I think, there are three dairies in the  whole county.  7  Finchum  B. Jones  G. Jones  B. Jones  G. Jones  B. Jones  Finchum  G. Jones  B. Jones  G. Jones  B. Jones  Finchum  G. Jones  Finchum  The town, at that point, was it Lacey or was it Hennessey? By the     50s   ?  By the    50s Lacey school was still going     And the store was still open, but this was just for small things.  But Hennessey was the main town. The railroad is what made the  difference. It came through Hennessey and it grew. It didn   t come to  Lacey and it died. In    53, when she graduated from Lacey, there was  five kids in her class. So it lasted, what   ?  I think it closed in    64, maybe?  In    64 or    65, somewhere in there.  Was it a one-room schoolhouse at that point?  No, no. It was a six-room schoolhouse  (Laughter)  When they built their gym, originally it was the largest gym in the  county. There was just enough room on the sidelines that they could put  folding chairs. That was it   You could put folding chairs all the way around.  And the court wasn   t full-court length. The ceiling was real low. So any  team that came and played, it was an entirely different situation.  (Laughter) Then they built a new gym four or five years before it closed.  The building there is still out there.  Greta, had your parents gone to that same school?  My dad had. They went through the eighth grade there because for quite  a while we didn   t have the high school. When my Uncle Glen graduated  from the eighth grade, his dad was definitely going to have more  education than that for his son so he sent him to prep school at A M. So  he went over there. He graduated from there. When my dad got to that  point, he went to prep school at A M, but before he graduated, Lacey  had a high school. He wanted to graduate from Lacey. So he came back  and was in the first graduating class at Lacey. My mother was in a  neighboring community so she didn   t go to Lacey School. We go quite a  ways back. (Laughter)  Education was important, it sounds like.  8  G. Jones  Finchum  G. Jones  B. Jones  G. Jones  B. Jones  Finchum  B. Jones  G. Jones  Finchum  B. Jones  Very important. My grandfather, he had studied medicine at one point  with his dad, who was the doctor. That idea ended when he made a  house call with his dad one time and they paid him with a chicken. He  said,    You know, any job that you get paid with farm animals, I don   t  think that   s what I want to do.    He knew he wanted to be an educator  and a farmer. He taught school. He taught in many of the one-room  schools around. I still visit with people that,    Oh, I went to school to  your grandfather,    or,    My mother did       or someone, and how much  this meant to them. Then he was the first superintendent of the Lacey  School when we got the consolidated school and had the high school and  we took in all the one-room schools. He was the first superintendent  there and taught there for a while.  And that supplemented the farm. That   s probably how they managed to  hang on to it, too?  Yes, it did. That   s right. I know he had said so many times,    Well, you  know, Ella was the one that saved the farm because she wrote the  senator to get that loan,    that they desperately had to have. (Laughs) He  always taught.  He was also a county commissioner for a short period of time. He was  very interested in roads. He was one of the instigators in building   Highway  51.  We also found out not too long ago that he was also the   they called it  the    president of the road      when the Drummond Road was put in. They  had the idea, some farmers in Loyal, Dover, Hennessey and Drummond  decided that we needed a highway from Kansas to Texas. That was  when that came about. He was always interested in roads, but we also  needed good country roads, too.  He was pretty active in anything that would help the community.  Civic-minded.  Yes.  He and one of the neighbors went from Hennessy to Lacey and got  people to sign a petition that they needed a highway. He was kind of in  charge of that building process and so on.  While he was teaching, was your mother doing most of the managing of  the farm during the day?  I don   t think so. That   s when they had a lot of kids, and the kids did a lot  9  G. Jones  B. Jones  G. Jones  B. Jones  Finchum  B. Jones  G. Jones  B. Jones  of the work. (Laughter) But when her folks got married, they bought the  adjoining farm. Same section, here, but the one just west of us. So they  moved up there. Ted and Marguerite moved into their house.  That was my parents. So that   s where I grew up.  But they always farmed together, up until he got to the point where he  couldn   t do anymore. They always worked together on it. They tried  about everything new that came along. (Laughs)  Some of the things they brought here, they would hear about them  someplace else. Daddy was just as much of a   I don   t know, instigator,  I guess, as Grandpa. (Laughs) They would go to wherever they were  raising that and find out all about it. When vetch came, I can remember  them working on getting vetch for this area.  Probably one of the biggest changes this area made   you always heard  that they planted cotton and ruined the land. You wear it out right quick.  Well, the biggest problem with cotton, it wasn   t wearing the land out, it  was blowing away during the winter after they harvested cotton. The  land was just left bare, there. They brought this vetch in. It   s a legume  that puts nitrogen back into the soil. They started raising that, along with  rye, because rye would hold up off the ground where they could  combine it. At one time, we had the biggest vetch processing plant in  Hennessey that there was. Everybody out here in the sand was raising  rye and vetch. Rye wasn   t much of a crop then. The animals don   t like to  eat it, but it would hold the vetch up off the ground so it wouldn   t mold  and die. Wheat would hold it up, but wheat matured earlier, and a lot of  oats would shatter. So, rye. I remember her dad took a truckload of vetch  into town back in probably the late    40s. He paid for his truck with the  one load. (Laughs) I think the next big change was the Lovegrass that  came in here.  Love?  Lovegrass. Weeping Lovegrass.  It   s a nice name for it   I think Johnson   s Seed Company is the one that kind of got interested in  that. They had one individual   Mr. Munger was interested in it. He got  some of it started. When the Soil Bank days came in, that   s what about  90 percent of this land was planted to. It went into the Soil Bank. It built  the soil up real good, and it was very hearty grass. You can find about  twenty-something acres of it still on this place. At one time, every bit of  land on both places here was in Lovegrass. But it is a fire hazard. They  10  Finchum  B. Jones  Finchum  B. Jones  Finchum  burn it every year. It usually burns like it has been soaked in gasoline.  So that is one reason we kind of like to get rid of it. But it was a big  lifesaver and it still is a pretty fair crop. The seed is very, very small. It  is about the size of salt. You   ve got to have your machines pretty tight.  When it is ready, it   s ready. You   ve got to go. You can   t wait two or  three days or the pods will just shatter.  But going back to the change, they used to list everything. In the early  days, the lister was your main tool. Well, that didn   t kill all your  vegetation. If you tried to list and grow wheat like they did, first thing  you know, the cheat would move in there and ruin your crop. So you had  to turn it over and that   s when they started to over plow. But when you  turn it all over, that   s when the sandy soil would erode very badly. I can  remember the    50s was just about as bad as it was in the    30s.  Everything wasn   t turned over like it was in the    30s. I don   t know. Her  folks used to always farm with horses. Then they got their first tractor in  the    30s.  During the Depression?  Yes. The Depression didn   t hurt this area quite as much as it did other  areas. They were already in a depression. So we just continued. Finances  were hard, but like I say, everything was barter in that part of the region.  Nobody had any money. You   d go down here to the store and buy a pair  of shoes for a dollar and a quarter.  Was the tractor new or used?  I   m sure it was used. I don   t know. They had an old MM combine that I  know was made in the    30s that they used in kind of the late    30s and  early    40s. Later on, I know Ted and his dad each had a tractor. Of  course, they usually hired somebody to drive Mr. Hickman   s and Ted  was on the other one. I   ve got a picture of when they were combining.  They   d pull the combine with the tractor, but they was pulling the wagon  to put the wheat in with horses. I   m sure they just pulled the wagon out  to the road and then hooked onto the car and go on to town, or they took  it to the bin and binned it.  Going back to the vetch, when we started dating, her dad was raising  quite a bit of vetch. It was awful bad about wrapping around all the  shafts in the combine. He sat his combine on fire nine different times.  But he was ready for it. He was always able to save it. I never will forget  that   talk about bad. Lose a combine and the whole crop at the same  time would be kind of rough. (Laughs)  Did you have to drive a tractor for them?  11  G. Jones  B. Jones  Finchum  G. Jones  B. Jones  Finchum  B. Jones  Finchum  B. Jones  G. Jones  B. Jones  G. Jones  B. Jones  G. Jones  Finchum  I drove a tractor quite a bit, not pulling a combine. I helped with the  plowing and so on. Then I drove the truck loaded with grain to town.  Her granny always road with her in the truck to supervise, I think.  (Laughter)  Did they participate in threshing rings back in those days?  I can remember when I was pretty small, the threshing crews coming. I  don   t know how long ago     I don   t know when they quit. I don   t think Dad ever worked on one after  he was married, but before that, he was in with a group that they   d go  from one farm to the next. They   d all work together. He and his brother  worked with a threshing crew for quite a while. My grandfather on my  mother   s side had a threshing machine with a neighbor. They did all that  out south and east of Hennessey. Matter of fact that was the only  threshing machine I ever worked on. He had bought one when they sold  the 101 Ranch out. Brought it over here, and probably the last threshing  machine in this area that ever ran. He used it to thresh peanuts.  So Greta, your parents had it from like    33 to    70   right in there?  From    33 to    89.  So over fifty years, then.  Yep. Her grandparents started off with this table.  Started off what?  When they got married, they bought this table.  Oh, yes.  So they used it, and then her folks used it.  So I grew up eating around this table. When Mother was finally able to  get a dining room to use, she was so thrilled. I said,    Please save that  table for me. I   d like to have it someday.    So my dad hung it on the wall  of the barn inside and they saved it for me. So when we got married, I  refinished it and our kids grew up around it. So it is rather special to us.  When did the two of you get married? Let   s put him on the spot.  12  G. Jones  B. Jones  G. Jones  B. Jones  G. Jones  Finchum  B. Jones  Finchum  B. Jones  Nykolaiszyn  B. Jones  G. Jones  B. Jones  Yes   January the 24th.  In 1957. We got married between semesters of our senior year in  college. Stayed for graduate school and     Her dad said she couldn   t get married in June because there was work to  be done on the farm. (Laughter) So we just set it up. I had a job over  there and she had a job. I had a semester to go and we said,    Well, we   ll  just go ahead and get married in January.    So we graduated. I got my  orders from the Army. They weren   t going to take me for a year and a  half. I knew I couldn   t get a job, hardly, for that period of time. I just  signed up for graduate school and kept the job I had and finished up my  master   s. I handed in my thesis one day and reported to Fort Sill that  afternoon. (Laughter)  I was typing pretty fast at that point.  For the record, by over there, we mean Oklahoma A M?  Yes.  Later, Oklahoma State.  Yes, we graduated      57 it was A M,    58 it was Oklahoma State.  How did you two meet?  How did we meet? That   s a good question. (Laughter) We had known  each other quite a while. We went to the same church, but she went to  school out here, and I went to school in Hennessey. I always had the  impression that she was going pretty steady with a young guy down the  road here, and I wasn   t particularly interested in breaking somebody up  or something     Honey, let   s face it. You were going pretty steady with someone.  Yeah, but when we were going to school, there were several in my class  going to school over there. We would ride back and forth   none of us  had cars   but one of our parents would take us over there and come get  us. I got a call from one of my classmates wanting to know if she could  ride back to Stillwater with me that evening. I said,    Well, yeah.    I took  her back and she lived in the same dorm that Greta Sue lived in. Just as  we pulled into the parking lot there in Stout Hall, Greta Sue came out  with some guy I   d never seen. I went,    Okay.    She smiled and waved  13  Finchum  B. Jones  G. Jones  Finchum  B. Jones  G. Jones  B. Jones  G. Jones  B. Jones  Finchum  B. Jones  G. Jones  B. Jones  G. Jones  Finchum  B. Jones  Finchum  and went on. We came home between semesters and I had tickets for the  basketball game. I called her up and asked her if she would like to go  over to the basketball game with me. Well, after hum hawing around for  a while, she finally decided to go. (Laughter) That was it.  So your first date was in     Gallagher-Iba. (Laughter)  Basketball game at A M.  And did they win?  They did  But I can   t tell you who they played. I have tried to find out.  (Laughter)  We   ll have to show you something after a while that commemorates our  first date.  Oh, yeah. But this same gal wound up being her roommate later on.  So I thank Coralyn every time I see her for coming back with him so he  had to come back to Stillwater. (Laughs)  And you were talking about that you worked in the library. That   s where  most of our dates were spent. I   d go in and pick her up and we   d go to  the library, study until the dorm closed and I   d take her back over there.  Which dorm did you live in?  She lived in Stout and I lived in Cordell.  He got a lot of walking in in those days.  If I   d been in Bennett, I   d be a little further away, but that   d be all.  (Laughter)  He   d come over and we   d usually go to vespers in the Student Union  and then, from there, to the library. And like he said, stay until it was  time to get back to the dorm.  Library is kind of halfway in between.  Yes. My grades sure improved after that. (Laughter)  Funny how that works, isn   t it?  14  B. Jones  Finchum  B. Jones  Finchum  G. Jones  Finchum  G. Jones  B. Jones  G. Jones  Finchum  B. Jones  G. Jones  B. Jones  I didn   t spend much time in the library that first semester. (Laughter)  What was your degree in?  Agriculture. I was in agronomy with a field crops major.  And what about yours?  I was in home economics. I was in clothing, textiles and merchandising.  Did you have to spend a semester or quarter in the home management  house?  Oh, yes. I spent a summer there.  She spent the summer there, and I spent the same summer at Fort Hood,  Texas.  He was in ROTC. (Laughter)  So when you got out, you came back to the farm?  No, I reported to the Army that day. I was in the service for two years.  Well, while you were in the service, we lived in California for a year and  a half while he was finishing out there. Our first daughter was born out  there.  We got back and I was going to go into farming with Dad, I thought. We  got here in January and I went in there about every day doing something.  About harvest time, he just told me, he said,    We just don   t have enough  for both of you. You   re going to have to do something else.    So I went  back over to Stillwater and talked to them. I was offered a job back with  Foundation Seed Stocks over there. I was getting ready to move over  there.  I came home that night and there was a car sitting in our driveway.  There was two guys in there. I didn   t know either one of them, but they  had just purchased that big seed house that you come across just before  the railroad. They said that they   d bought that that day. They were  wanting to know if I would come in and run it for them. I called back  over to Stillwater and said I was going to stay over here. I ran that for  three years. That didn   t work out like it was supposed to.  So again, I went back to Stillwater and I worked over there for two and a  15  Finchum  B. Jones  G. Jones  B. Jones  Finchum  Nykolaiszyn  B. Jones  Finchum  B. Jones  G. Jones  B. Jones  half years as secretary-manager at Foundation Seed Stocks. Dr. Gardner  and I didn   t agree on a lot of things, so I had a chance to leave that and I  went back and got in the seed business again. They put a plant in at  Dover. We processed   basically, mung beans was the biggest thing and  rye and cowpeas. While I was at Hennessey, we processed about 10  percent of the mung beans used in the United States, in Hennessey.  Now, they don   t even grow any around here.  I   m not even sure I know what that is.  Well, if you eat Chinese food, you   ll have bean sprouts in them just  about all the time.  And those are mung bean sprouts.  That   s all they   re used for.  Did you know that?  No.  They   ve got a real nice sprout. You   ve seen alfalfa sprouts, haven   t you?  Yes.  The sprout is just a lot bigger, coarser     So you know where they used to come from. (Laughter)  Like I told you before, rye was not very well desired, but Noble  Foundation came up with a new variety of rye while I was over at  Stillwater called Elbon. I happened to be one of them to go to Noble  Foundation and pick it up. We brought it back to the agronomy farm.  And N.B. Thomas was the head of Foundation Seed Stocks at the time  and he said,    I don   t want that stuff even in the warehouse because it is  known to overrun wheat.    So we took it to the agronomy farm and  stored it. Had to clean up their cleaner and the stuff was in terrible  shape. They did a great job of developing the rye variety, but they didn   t  keep it pure. They had oats in it, they had wheat in it, they had barley in  it. (Laughs) So we had to clean that up.  The next year, we put it in, I think, sixteen-inch rows. So we rowed all  that stuff out and took that seed and started over. So I   ve been with  Elbon rye ever since the day it was released. We had one of the first  commercial fields, after the college sold the seeds. The biggest thing  about it, it would produce more than the old rye because rye is a cross-  16  Finchum  B. Jones  Finchum  B. Jones  Finchum  B. Jones  G. Jones  pollinated plant, but it would accept its own pollen, too. So you have a  better job with pollination, which increased your seed production. So  about 90 percent of the rye grown around here today is Elbon.  And you did that on this farm?  No, I did that on a farm out east of Hennessey. Dad was farming a place  there that was pretty sandy, but it was right on the edge of hard land, and  everybody out there was raising wheat. You have to have isolation of a  quarter-mile from the other rye so we had a look around to find a place  to plant it. Now you don   t have to worry about it, these neighbors plant  the same thing. (Laughter)  So when the two of you became owners and managers of the farm, what  were the main products?  Well, at that time, we had an allotment of wheat at that period of time. I  planted the acreage of wheat that they allowed me to, and the excess  acres went to rye. We did that up until they did away with that program  and they let us plant whatever we wanted to. At that time, we had to  leave some of the land out completely   couldn   t do anything with it.  But then they reversed it and you could plant whatever you wanted so  we started planting the rye   planted everything to rye. But I raised  registered rye for several years. They finally got so much of it there  wasn   t a bonus in it. It wasn   t worth the trouble you had to go through to  produce it so I   ve just gone back to the common rye.  We grew mung beans or cowpeas. That   s when we were still  moldboarding the ground. You turn everything under and plant the mung  beans the same day you plowed it. That gave you a cover crop. Usually  the mung bean crop would pay the expenses to put your rye in. Now that  they found out they could pasture crabgrass and do very well with it for  cattle. It used to be that   s what just ruined you, trying to grow mung  beans or cowpeas. We fought the stuff like the devil. It was like we were  tearing up better stuff than we had. (Laughs) I don   t think there is a field  of mung beans anywhere around here, now. Like I said, it was just a big,  big crop. We processed a couple million pounds a year. If you plant  them now, the deer will eat them up. We   ve got more deer now than  we   ve ever had, which you would think with all the land that has been  cleared out, they would thin out, but they   re getting thicker.  And coyotes, too?  Coyotes, too. A few bobcats.  Lots of critters around. (Laughter)  17  Finchum  B. Jones  Finchum  B. Jones  Finchum  B. Jones  Finchum  How many ponds are on this piece?  One.  Manmade, or was it   ?  Manmade.  During the    40s when they were doing that sort of thing?  That was probably done in the    50s. We   re pretty fortunate here. We   re  not too far from water. Most of the water was provided by wells. They  hand-dug some of them back there, but a lot of them just drilled to sand  point. You don   t know what a sand point is, do you? (Laughter) It is a  piece of pipe about that small. It has got a point on the end of it.  Depending on the size of stream you want, that pipe is covered with a  screen wire of different sizes. You drive that down until you hit your  water. Then you put a pump on it. It can   t be over twenty foot down.  You can   t pump water that far. You can suck it, about twenty foot is  maximum. You can push it as far as you want to. If your water is less  than twenty foot, you can get by with this sand point. A lot of them, they  would have it on top of the ground and still get water, or they would dig  down part ways.  The farm that my dad had, they had dug down twenty-some foot and  lined the walls with brick so it wouldn   t cave in, and then drove the sand  point on down another twenty foot. Then hook up your wind panel and  you had water. The water well they had, I don   t know. I suppose when  they built the house, it was right close to the house. It is still there. Of  course, they did away with the windmill and put in electricity and put a  pump in there. They   ve got two wells down there. I use the other one  because it is closer to where the tanks were. Six or seven years ago, I  couldn   t see my tanks because they were all under water. Now we don   t  have enough water to grow. (Laughter)  We built the house here in    76. They had the house completed and I  went to Enid to get the last load of bricks. We were living in town that  time. When I got back to Hennessey, it was just about dark. I just parked  the truck there and I was going to bring it back here the next morning. I  couldn   t even get here the next morning. It had washed the road out.  (Laughs) So they didn   t even work on the house for another six months  until it dried up. They came back and finished up. So it can change a lot  out here, real quick. (Laughter)  If this house was built in    76, where was the homestead house?  18  B. Jones  Finchum  B. Jones  G. Jones  B. Jones  G. Jones  Finchum  B. Jones  Finchum  B. Jones  Finchum  G. Jones  Finchum  We   re across the fence from the Centennial Farm, here. The Centennial  Farm starts out here with these trees. This place, her grandparents  bought later on. Grandma would sell it to us, but nobody else. So that   s  how we got it. (Laughter)  Well, then on the Centennial Farm, are there any buildings on it still  standing?  Not any of the original.  We do have pictures of them for you to see, if you   d like to.  The flood of    57 got up to the floor of the house. That pretty well  messed the house up. For some reason or another, there was not a  foundation all the way around the house. They had a footing, but then  they had a cellar under it. I still think it was probably dug out after the  house was built.  There is no concrete involved. It was just all dirt.  Was it a two-story house?  Yes, two-story house.  Describe the layout on the inside of it a little.  You can do that better than I could. (Laughter)  Where was your room?  My room was upstairs and to the left. It was a two-story house. It had  two bedrooms upstairs. No closets. One time, I was like,    Daddy, where  did you all put your clothes?       Oh, we   d hang them on a nail.    I said,     All of them?    He said,    We didn   t have that many.    (Laughter) So after  the folks moved in, they put in some closets. There is one bedroom  downstairs. That was my parents    room. There was a living room and a  single room, kind of like this, kitchen and dining room and so on,  together. I think that was probably the favorite room of the house. That   s  where we all spent most of our time. The living room was a little bit  more formal. That is where the new dining room suit went that replaced  this. Then later, I can remember when we got running water. We built a  bathroom and utility room onto the house.  About what year would that have been?  19  G. Jones  Finchum  G. Jones  Finchum  G. Jones  B. Jones  Finchum  G. Jones  Finchum  G. Jones  B. Jones  Finchum  Nykolaiszyn  G. Jones  B. Jones  G. Jones  B. Jones  G. Jones  B. Jones  I would guess that was late    40s.  Rural electric came in?  Yes.  How did they heat?  For quite a while, with a woodstove, a potbellied stove. For a time,  Mother cooked on that, too. Then she got a range, later on, and  refrigerator and so on. Then they went to a floor furnace. When did we  decide that was? Early    50s?  Probably real early    50s,    48 to    50. Somewhere in there.  I   ll ask Julie   s favorite question, too. Since they raised chickens, did they  have a certain way of harvesting those?  Harvesting the eggs, or the chickens themselves? (Laughter)  The chickens.  Oh, yes.  That   s what everybody ate.  She likes to know the techniques.  Everybody seems to have a different technique when it comes to  slaughtering chickens.  Oh, boy. (Laughter)  My job was always to cut the heads off.  I didn   t have to do that.  Had a stump about this big around and just do it like that. (Gestures) My  mother used to put a broom handle over their neck and pull the head off.  Ooh, couldn   t do that.  To me, it was easier to just cut the thing clear off and let them flop for a  while. When they get through flopping, you go and put them down in  hot water and pull the feathers off.  20  G. Jones  B. Jones  Finchum  B. Jones  Finchum  B. Jones  G. Jones  B. Jones  G. Jones  Finchum  G. Jones  So I got to do that. I would go get them and remove the feathers and cut  them up and   fried chicken  (Laughter)  Just about everybody would order a hundred chickens in the spring.  They   d be big enough for harvest time and you   d feed the crew. That  was your main meal. They   d butcher hogs, but very, very few people  around here ever ate beef. If they had a calf to sell, they   d sell it because  it would bring more than the hog would. You   d either can the meat or  put salt on it, salt and brown sugar is what they   d rub it with. Go down  there and rub it every two or three days. That   s the way it was cured. Or  you   d put it in a great big crock     And smoke it?  Cover it up with lard. Just buried it in lard. Like I say, a lot of it was  dried. I don   t know if they smoked a whole lot, then, but they dried an  awful lot. I can remember helping Grandpa go down there with salt and  sugar and rub on the hams and things. You wonder how any of them  lived. (Laughter)  Bet it was pretty good eating, though.  It was.  It was very good.  But they all did a lot of hard labor, then, that they   d burn it off.  Being a home economist, when our family came along, we didn   t fry  chicken, we didn   t fry anything. I just was very insistent we had a really  healthy diet. At that time, we talked about, how in the world did our  parents and grandparents live? We decided, well, it was all the hard  work that they did. They lived long lives. My grandmother lacked three  weeks of being 100 when she died. Had an aunt who was a week or so  from her 104th birthday. All of my dad   s sisters were up in their late  nineties when they died. So they lived healthy lives, too. (Laughs) At  that point, I decided our family wasn   t going to eat like that. Maybe I  could have taken lessons from them. I think I probably did. My  grandparents lived just across the fence   west of us from where we are  now. So I spent a lot of time with Grandma and a lot of time with my  mother. They were both wonderful cooks. They knew what they were  doing.  What was your favorite meal they would fix?  I think probably the fried chicken. Chicken and noodles     21  B. Jones  G. Jones  B. Jones  G. Jones  Finchum  G. Jones  B. Jones  G. Jones  B. Jones  Finchum  G. Jones  Finchum  G. Jones  Finchum  G. Jones  Her mother made the best noodles. She didn   t learn how,  but   (Laughter) They were great.  That   s why he married me, I think, for more of those noodles. We have  pictures and so on.  I was going to show her the potato harvest.  Oh, the potato harvest, yeah. (Laughs)  Did your mother or did you participate in home demonstration clubs?  Oh, yes. (Laughs) In fact, when the first home demonstration club in this  area was formed, my grandmother was still very active. She was the first  president, the first two terms. I think there were thirty-seven women who  joined and my mother was in home demonstration work all her life. As  soon as we moved back, I joined an extension homemaker club.  (Laughter) I continue to be. Of course, 4-H was a big part of our lives.  Did you find it? We had it last night.  No, I   ll look for it a little bit later.  Would it be over there?  It could be.  What was the name of the club?  The 4-H Club or the extension homemakers?  The very first club that started.  It was the Lacey Home Demonstration Club.  Lacey.  That   s the one that Mother and Grandma were both very active in. The  one I joined when I came back   the Lacey group was getting old  enough that they were just about ready to quit, I think. The first time  they didn   t take a full display to the county fair, I really talked to my  mother,    Now, you just can   t quit doing that  That   s a very important  part.    She said,    Honey, we   ve been doing it for so long. We   re ready to  sit back and watch the other people do it.    I understand that, now.  (Laughter) I didn   t understand it when she told me. I joined the  Farmerettes Extension Homemaker Club. I still belong to it. I have it  22  B. Jones  G. Jones  B. Jones  G. Jones  Finchum  G. Jones  Finchum  B. Jones  here every year. (Laughs) So it is a very important part, I think, of rural  life. I really do.  I heard about 4-H all my growing up years because my dad and his  sisters were real active in 4-H. I would hear about the entire family  loading up, driving to Stillwater, and they   d spend the week at 4-H  Roundup. What we call it now   I don   t think it was called that, then.  Spend a week on the campus at A M, and how much they all enjoyed  it. I   d hear about the demonstrations and talks and so on. So of course,  when I got to be nine years old, I joined 4-H. Going back just a little bit,  I asked Daddy one time how he decided to be a farmer. He said he had  wanted to be ever since his 4-H days. He said he really enjoyed the  farming and the animals and so on. So I went through nine years of 4-H  and our children came along, and they did, too. So it has been a very  important part. I was the adult leader here for fifteen years. All the time  that our kids were in 4-H   it was either that or we wouldn   t have a club.  Nobody else wanted to do it. (Laughter)  And now they don   t.  Now they don   t, and that   s a shame. Our oldest daughter grew up to  be   first, she was the extension homemaker agent in Custer County.  Then when the 4-H agent became available, she said,    This is who I  really want to work with.    So she applied for that job and became the 4-  H agent out there. They hired another home economist. I don   t know,  you learn so much in 4-H. At the time I joined it, it was because of all  the things I   d heard and everything. I had no idea how much I would  learn from it, new friends I   d make from all over.  She   d ask each of the kids at one point,    What is the best thing they had  for preparing them for future life?    All three of them said 4-H.  And they   d all been very active in so many other things. I asked them  separately. I didn   t want a copycat answer. Every one of them didn   t  even have to think      4-H.    Of course, that   s what I had thought had  shaped them, but    (Laughter)  So you have three children. Daughters, sons?  We have two daughters and one son. We have some other pictures I   ll  show you a little later. When you see our ancestor wall, you might like  to see that when we   re through.  Did any of them attend OSU?  Jeanette has two degrees from over there     23  G. Jones  B. Jones  G. Jones  B. Jones  G. Jones  B. Jones  G. Jones  B. Jones  G. Jones  B. Jones  G. Jones  B. Jones  Finchum  B. Jones  G. Jones  Her husband has two degrees from there.  Carly Kay has one degree from there, and she left us and went to  Virginia and got her master   s and a husband. She   s still up there.  (Laughter)  I knew she shouldn   t have gone in the first place. (Laughter)  Our son went to Stillwater one year and that is back when farming was  about to fall apart. He said,    Dad, there is no future in agriculture right  now with the way things are.    He said,    I think I want to go into  photography.    He loved to take pictures. I said,    Well, where?    He said,     Well, there are three schools. One of them is in Rochester, New York,  Santa Barbara, California and East Texas.     Commerce, Texas.  I said,    Well, we better look at Texas.    (Laughter)  We thought we might see him once in a while.  So we took off and I don   t remember when, but we drove down to look  the school over and talk to them. He said,    Yeah, that   s what I think I  want to do.    We went down there and while we were there, picked up  something there and said,    Well, the Board of Regents was thinking  about raising the out-of-state tuition.    I thought,    That   s all we need.     They raised it alright. They quadrupled it. So he went down there for a  year and it just wasn   t any way we could handle that. So he stayed out  for a year and worked. That way he could get Texas residency.  He worked in Texas.  He went back and finished up, and he went to Indiana and he got his  master   s up there.  He came home from college with a wife, too.  Yep.  It happens.  Yeah, it seems like it does. Pretty good place to find them. It did for me.  (Laughter)  We   d keep hearing in phone calls, he   d say,    LeAnn something,     24  B. Jones  G. Jones  Finchum  B. Jones  Finchum  B. Jones  Finchum  B. Jones  G. Jones  Finchum  B. Jones     LeAnn       Finally, I said,    LeAnn, is this someone we should know  about?       Yes, probably.    Sure enough, she was. (Laughter)  He graduated there and got married the next week. Went to Indiana and  they came back. She hadn   t finished so they went back to Commerce  and lived there for a year and let her finish school. Then they went to  Oregon. So we   ve got them on both coasts.  He   s a fine art photographer. This is what his interest was. He didn   t  want to be a portrait photographer. He wanted to do scenic    Said he  needed a little more interesting surroundings than the flatlands of  Oklahoma and Texas. Well, yes, I could see that. So they had about  decided they wanted in the Portland, Oregon area. They really liked that.  She was a hotel and restaurant major. That   s four home economists in  her family, now. (Laughs) The hotel she was working for, the Marriott,  transferred her out there. Moved them to Portland. That   s where they  stuck. They love it.  In that original house, they had a cellar, I   m assuming?  Yes.  And they canned and lined it with canned goods?  Yeah, they used to use pressure cookers to can everything. Now they use  them for bombs. (Laughter)  I noticed that, too. When they were having the issues with the Dust Bowl  and around, did they participate in the program to get terracing put in?  No. We don   t have that much slope, here. Getting in the hard land, half a  mile this side, even on the other side of the creek, you start seeing  terraces on both sides of the road. Here, you don   t seem them because it  is pretty flat. If you terraced it, it would wash away with the sand. Now,  we did put the shelterbelts up out here. There   s a lot of those. I say  we   ve got one of the few that is still left, but they put them in when you  was, what, two or three years old when they started?  Possibly when they started     Was that part of the WPA?  Yes. When he signed up for them, they came back and told him,    Ted, if  you will cultivate between the rows, we   ll send a bunch of men out here  and clean up the middles.    So they came out there and hoed it just like  they did cotton. So they had three shelterbelts. They had two on the  25  Finchum  B. Jones  Finchum  B. Jones  G. Jones  Finchum  B. Jones  Finchum  B Jones  G. Jones  Finchum  B. Jones  Finchum  B. Jones  Finchum  G. Jones  Centennial Farm   no, they had three. One of them is not a full half-mile.  He had the place at the south and they had another shelterbelt over  there part of the way. Like I say, I can show you where they were.  Did the WPA build an outdoor toilet for you?  Yes, ma   am. I   ve still got the concrete part of it down there.  Was it a one-seater or two?  I guess, one-seater.  One-seater. It was, for a fact. They took pictures every so often to see  how the trees had grown. I was the measuring post. (Laughter)  What kinds of trees were they?  They planted a variety of trees. Cottonwoods, elm, bodark, and cedar.  There is another one out there. I don   t know what it is.  Which ones for the shelterbelt, though, the cedar?  All of them. They put one row of each in. They put cottonwood in  because it was a fast growing tree. The cedar is pretty slow-growing, but  it does the best as far as stopping the wind. The elms grow pretty fast.  They probably didn   t do much good for ten years. Then they get up big  enough to block some of the wind.  We have really appreciated this shelterbelt just south of us because it  keeps so much wind from up here.  I just assumed most of them were cedars because they went to the  ground.  You   ll see a lot of cedar trees planted out west, now, for different  reasons. You ever see a snow fence?  Yes.  They   re planting cedar trees for those, now, so they don   t have to put the  fence up every year. They put them under plastic, water them. It   s quite  a deal    (Laughs)  Did your mother or grandmother quilt?  Oh, yes.  26  Finchum  B. Jones  G. Jones  B. Jones  Nykolaiszyn  Finchum  G. Jones  Finchum  B. Jones  G. Jones  Finchum  B. Jones  G. Jones  You chuckled, huh?  You want to see some real pretty quilts? (Laughter) We   ve got one quilt,  the family story on the thing, it took first place in the World   s Fair, but  we don   t know which one. We think it was St. Louis. It   d about have to  be because the lady who quilted it was her aunt up at Ames.  She was the one who raised my mother. Mother was orphaned when she  was four. Aunt Suzie and Uncle Gus took she and her brother in. Aunt  Suzie is the one who made it. Why don   t you get it and show them,  honey? She brought it to Oklahoma from Illinois where she lived, then.  So the dates were comparable. It had its first prize ribbon on it, grand  champion ribbon on it, when she gave it to us. She was a master quilter.  I think she specialized   she was an artist, too. She painted several  pictures, which you see around here. The one picture we have of the log  house that Grandpa and Grandma moved into when they were first  married   moved this table into it, and so on   she had done in pastels  for them. It came from them to my dad because he was born in that  house. Then we got it. Aunt Suzie drew the quilting patterns for other  people for their quilts. She had done this one.  She sewed that and pulled it apart and stuffed the cotton under it.  Tanya is our quilt expert.  Not expert   I love quilts, though.  Oh, I do, too.  My goodness, that took her a long time, didn   t it?  No telling how much time that thing took.  I asked her one time how she did that and she used a closely woven  fabric on top and a loosely woven one on the bottom. They would quilt it  and go to the back and break the head off a needle and part it and put  cotton in every place it needed to be. Then they   d close the weave back  up.  So who gets it next?  They won   t tell us. (Laughter) Tried to tell the kids to pick out what they  wanted, and     At one point, I had done ceramics and I made a nativity set that has  27  Finchum  G. Jones  B. Jones  Nykolaiszyn  B. Jones  Nykolaiszyn  B. Jones  G. Jones  B. Jones  G. Jones  B. Jones  always been the centerpiece of our Christmas. Last Christmas, our  second daughter said,    Mom, do you know how dumb that was to make  one nativity set when you   ve got three children?    Well, yes, I intended  to make the other two, but then, I said,    It wouldn   t have been so  special.    (Laughter) Well     There are three wise men, they can each have one. (Laughter)  That   s a good idea. Are there any of these they would want to see,  honey?  I don   t know. I was trying to see if I could see that sand point on there,  but I can   t.  So what is going on on the farm, today?  Well, this is my last crop.  Really?  I   ve been growing rye on it   by golly   I can   t remember how many  years now. Probably the last twenty-some. Pasturing about half of it out  and harvesting the other half. Two years ago, when it got so dry, I had to  get rid of all my cattle because I had two bales of hay. No prospects for  any more. So I started culling the cattle and finally got down to where  there wasn   t hardly anything left. I thought I might as well go ahead and  haul them all off. I   ve harvested the rye since, but I   ve made a deal to  rent it out next year. So when this harvest is over, that will be it.  Our daughter has been trying to get him to retire for several years now.  She said,    Dad, you   re just not as young as you used to be. You need to  let somebody else do that.    He didn   t want to.  I had one grandson that has been coming for the last eleven years to help  me.  He   s the one in Virginia.  His mother came to me way back and said,    Would you be willing to let  him come to the farm and just learn, learn what it is to live on a farm and  learn some work ethics?    She said,    You don   t have to pay him.    I said,     Honey, I can do that.    So he came when he was nine years old. Of  course, the first couple years, he wasn   t worth a lot. (Laughter) But now,  he can do anything. Turned it over to him. I got to where I   ve lost all my  strength. I have trouble hooking up equipment and anything like that.  The last time I was cutting, which was four years ago, I believe, might  28  Finchum  B. Jones  G. Jones  Finchum  G. Jones  have been five, a cloud was coming up. It looked like it was going to  rain, but we were just about to finish up. So I was putting the grain in a  bin down here with the auger. We stopped to unload the truck. He said,     Grandpa, you go head and cut. I   ll get this in the bin and we can get  through.    Sure enough, we did. (Laughter) It rained pretty hard that  night, which would   ve delayed the harvest three or four days if there had  been anything left. But he was pretty young then to take over but I didn   t  worry about it. I imagine last year is going to be his last year because he  turned twenty, now. Starting his college work so I don   t imagine there  will be time to come help Grandpa.  I   m sure he   ll miss it, too.  I   m sure he will. It was real funny, when he first started doing things,  he   d call his dad or his dad would call him about every night,    Well,  what did you do today?    Then his dad would go to work. He works for  NASA. All the people around him,    Well, what is Nathan doing, today?  What is he doing this week?    Every one of them said,    Oh, I would give  anything if my kids would do something like that.    Said everybody  either had an uncle or grandfather or something that they   d spent time on  the farm with. They really cherished it. I think Nathan did.  A couple of summers ago, Nathan and I were sitting at the table. I guess  maybe you   d taken different lunch hours   anyway, it was just the two  of us. I said,    Nathan, you have no idea how much the time you spent  with us has meant.    I said,    We feel like we know you so well.    We  were with him 24/7, you know, we just really enjoyed that. He said,     Oh, Grandma, not near as much as it   s meant to me.    I said,    Oh,  honey, you don   t have to say that.    He said,    No, I mean it  It has meant  so much to me to be able to come here every summer and work on the  farm.    I thought,    Yes     (Laughter)  Mission accomplished, huh?  Yes, yes. I had written stories about the family for   our county museum  was doing a centennial book. I was working on it with them. The big  part of it, of course, was getting stories from all the pioneers. The  pioneers of Kingfisher County. We had a thousand-word limit on words  for the story because if you start talking, you can go a long ways. After I  got going, I was thinking as many generations as my family has been  here, there are people all over the county who have known different  generations. I wanted to get them all in there so they would know where  they were and what had happened to them. I called the guy at the  museum and said,    What do you do if you have more than a thousand  words?    He said,    Write another story.    (Laughter) Well, that made  sense. So I wrote one about my great-grandparents, then my  29  Finchum  B. Jones  Finchum  B. Jones  G. Jones  B. Jones  G. Jones  B. Jones  G. Jones  grandparents, then my parents and then us and our children   they have  lots of friends all over the county. I wound up with seven stories.  (Laughter) I kind of redid them a little bit with these, so you can read  them later and know a little bit more about us. Anyway, we   re very  much into history of all kinds, but especially family history.  We need to back up and ask about holidays. Are there any special  holidays? What do you do on Christmas, Thanksgiving, July the 4th   ?  Christmas and Fourth of July     Not Thanksgiving.  No, I   ll tell you why. Her grandparents were married on the Fourth of  July. Her dad was born on the Fourth of July. So they had a double  reason   the family always got together and kept doing that until Ted got  up   or Marguerita got to where she was not up to fixing the meals and  everything so we took that over. It was a big enough deal that I cooked a  whole hog. The Hickman bunch came from all over. Of course, they had  spread over and multiplied a little bit. (Laughter)  I had an aunt in San Francisco and an aunt in Texas, an uncle in Eastern  Oklahoma in Spiro. They always came every Fourth of July, for the day.  They   d stay a day or two and that was the big one. Everybody fixed up,  but I took on cooking the meat. We did that two or three times and then  it started tapering off. There wasn   t as many coming. We backed up and  I started cooking brisket. Didn   t have so much left over and stuff like  that, but so Fourth of July has always been a big day. Our daughter got  married on the Fourth of July, too.  We had a sunrise wedding in our front yard. Can you believe that?  It rained all day the day before. She sat there in that window seat and  cried all day. (Laughter) The next morning was beautiful.  We did put tarps down on the walkway. Of course, we had to borrow  folding chairs from every place. Earlier in the wedding planning and so  on, she said,    Oh, it   s going to be so much easier to have a wedding at  home     (Laughter) I said,    What did you say?    She repeated it and        Well...    She said,    No, you don   t have to take your clothes and go to  the church.       Well, you   re right, I hadn   t thought about that. But you  know, the last time I checked, when you have your wedding at the  church, they have seats for people to sit in. They call them pews.  (Laughter) And the kitchen, they have dishes to serve them on. They  have tables for people to sit at. Yeah   you have a point.    But we had it  30  B. Jones  G. Jones  Finchum  G. Jones  anyway. (Laughter) Like he said, it was a beautiful day.  When we talked to the photographer, we asked him,    What time should  we put on the invitations?    He said,    Now, you   ll want sunrise pictures.  I would suggest leaving that for       She had requested a sunrise wedding  because she   d always run at that time of the morning. She was in track.  She said it is just beautiful then. So I said,    Why don   t we set the  wedding for about seven?    but this also meant he would be here at  sunrise, anyway. Her college roommate just about had a stroke when  they told her she had to be here at four thirty ready to have pictures  made, because she was not an early riser and she was in the wedding.  (Laughs) But it worked out beautifully. People were sitting there before  the wedding and during the wedding. You could see the squirrels  running up the trees, branch to branch, a few rabbits ran across and  somewhere in the middle, the preacher asked for a few moments of  silence, just enjoy the surroundings. A deer got up out in this field and  walked across. Someone later said,    Who choreographed this for you?  Was it Walt Disney?    (Laughs) I said,    Well, might have been     But it  was awfully nice. How many years later when Carla got married?  Four or five.  Four or five. She wanted a garden wedding, too. Well, alright, we can do  that. We know how, now  Of course, we borrowed the little snack tray  things to serve people on, and so on. That was before they had pretty  disposable ones. We borrowed from all the club ladies. They put them  together and they had things for weddings. We put them together and  everybody had theirs marked so we   d know whose they were. (Laughs)  Not too long ago, Carla said,    Mom, I can see saying yes to one wedding  at home, but two? You had to be out of your mind     I said,    Yes, and if  Noel had wanted to get married here, we   d have said yes again      (Laughter) In fact, he did want to and said something about it. I said,     Well, honey, we   d love to have it but this isn   t your call. This is  LeAnn   s. Wherever she wants to have the wedding, and she   ll probably  want to have it in her church.       Oh, well, okay.    (Laughter) But we do  Fourth of July and then Christmas has been our own family   s favorite.  We do a lot of special things at Christmas.  Growing up in the old farmhouse, did you do anything special for  holidays, there? July 4th, I   m sure was still     Yes, July 4th has always been. From the time I was a little girl, of  course, Grandpa and Grandma   it was out there first because it was  Papa and Momma   s anniversary. The kids came home from California  and Texas and all around for that. So my cousins and I were very, very  close because of this. Like he said, it went to my parents and lived down  31  B. Jones  G. Jones  B. Jones  G. Jones  here until it was our turn, and we   re still having them.  Christmas has always been hers   she just loves to decorate. When the  kids were real small, she saw a magazine somewhere. This lady had  such a special tree, with all the little ornaments she   d collected. So she  gets a hold of the magazine and gets her address and wrote to her and  she gave her some. She said,    Well, I can pick up some of these  decorations for you, if you would like?    She had a lot more  opportunities out in California.  She lived in Manzanita, California.  So she started collecting different ornaments, all real small, and made  several of them. So each year, we kept adding to it. Pretty well fill up a  tree now. (Laughter) But that lady stopped to see us right after we   d  built the house. Matter of fact, we didn   t even have the road out here in  the front. We came in on the old lease road and come up this way. They  called and were going through, wanted to know if they could come out.     Well, of course.    I gave them directions to get here. They got in real  late that night, driving a little motor home. He told them when he got  there,    This had better be it because I   m not going any farther.     (Laughter) So they pulled up in the front yard and stayed, I think, three  days and had a real good visit with them.  It had described her tree in the magazine as being miniature toy  decorations. Her mother had been a French war bride and she wanted to  raise her family with the same kind of decorating they did there. So this  was how Ann had grown up, with those, so she started looking for them.  I said,    Where do you find them?? She sent me an eight by ten picture of  their Christmas tree. It was darling. When I wrote to her, I said,    I have  two very small daughters and I would love to decorate like that, but I  don   t know how or where.    So she sent me that picture. So she started  shopping for us. Of course, as people saw what we were doing, they  would bring us back different things from places they were. So we have  a lot of souvenir type decorations. Of course, we got inspired to make a  lot of decorations so the kids and I made quite a few. So decorating our  tree is a real fun time.  Bill had always taken the kids out to chop down a Christmas tree. We  had always used cedar trees. Of course, they   re not always as pretty as  we   d like them to be. First, when LeAnn was here, we looked at a  picture of it later and I said,    Oh, LeAnn, that was just terrible.       She  said,    Well, I thought it was kind of cute.    (Laughter) It wasn   t the  perfect Christmas tree like now, but anyway. We started making  cookies when the kids were little. They would take plates of cookies to  their Sunday school teacher and their school teacher and their music  32  B. Jones  G. Jones  B. Jones  G. Jones  B. Jones  Finchum  B. Jones  Finchum  B. Jones  Finchum  B. Jones  G. Jones  teacher. Anybody that worked with them, they   d take a plate of cookies  to them. They were something else, too. One of the kinds of cookies, the  only one who could frost them was Bill because he could get the frosting  on really smooth and even, and then I would hand-paint them. There  were angels and Santa Clauses and     Angels and the chickens were the two hardest as far as painting.  We named them the   what are the Christmas birds? Anyway     The gingerbread man and the reindeer and the drummer boy and the  train.  There were just about five different kinds of cookies and they were all  decorated differently and so on. Everybody loved to get Christmas  cookies. Then Daddy, again, built us our cookie tree.  You ever heard of a cookie tree?  No. (Laughter)  All it was was a dowel rod about this long. They came out and tier it in  and then you just take regular Christmas tree ornament hooks and drill a  hole in the cookie and hang them on there. They   d have a tea party and  all the kids could take the cookies they wanted off.  Kind of like a gumdrop tree for Easter?  Yes, just about the same thing. They really enjoyed it. When the girls  got bigger where they could help so much, they got so carried away  cooking cookies for Christmas. The year we went back to Stillwater,  when I went to work for the college over there, our son hadn   t been born  yet. He was due on Christmas day, but he came a little early. So she  cooked the cookies a little early. That year, she cooked 144 dozen  cookies. She got kind of carried away with it. (Laughter) I went with our  son on a scout trip one time. We went to Padre Island. Took all three-wheelers  down there. She sent a five-gallon bucketful of cookies with  us. (Laughs)  Were you a stay-at-home mom, then? Or did you work off the farm?  Oh, she didn   t stay much. (Laughter) She was on the go.  The Christmas card book that has a picture of the cookie tree. Yes, I was  pretty much a stay-at-home mom between trips with the kids. (Laughs)  Like I said, they were very active in a lot of things. Until they got to  33  B. Jones  Finchum  B. Jones  Finchum  B. Jones  G. Jones  B. Jones  G. Jones  B. Jones  G. Jones  B. Jones  driving I got to go.  The year we moved out here, we left here every morning with three  vehicles. One to school, one for me and one for her going to work.  Gasoline went up. (Laughter) But the girls never did ride the school bus  out here. Jeanette was in track, so she would pick up her car or  something and stay after school. The other kids had to wait for her, but  they   d come on their own.  We always ask if there was supplemental income in order to be able to  keep the farm.  There has been all along. Her granddad worked. Her dad started   his  first job was with the ASC office, it was called something different,  then. He went out and measured acreages and checking records and stuff  for different counties. He got paid mileage going all over the state for  that. The thing that really got him, and it sounds so crazy, but if he went  from here to Garfield County, which would be Enid, they would pay him  mileage from here to the city limits. Any driving around that he had to  do, that was on him, but they would pay him to the city limits of the  town where he was to go. Then the Farm Bureau Insurance got started  here and he was the first Farm Bureau Insurance agent. He did that up  until he retired. I worked in the seed business most of the time.  Have you had to have hired help other than the grandson?  Very, very little. I would use some of the people I had working for me in  the seed business if I really had to have something, but that was not very  often. I   d do it nights or weekends. I look back now and wonder really  why or how she put up with it. (Laughter) I   d get off work and go run all  night long to go back to work the next day and she didn   t even know  where I was at. At that time, I was farming some land five miles south  and three miles east of Hennessey.  Plus this land.  Plus this land.  And my aunt and uncle   s     That was a little bit later on, I started farming up at Ames.  For a little while, he was going from Ames to east of Dover to farm.  So seventeen miles in one direction, eighteen miles the other.  34  Nykolaiszyn  B. Jones  Nykolaiszyn  B. Jones  G. Jones  B. Jones  How many acres?  I was farming right at eight hundred at that time. We had four hundred  acres in Ames. I had the quarter up at Dover and the quarter there at  Hennessey, which you could only have nine hundred acres cultivation.  This place here had 110 and I think the place we   ve been talking about  had right at 120. But the shelterbelts, the house area and stuff is taking  out quite a bit of the cultivated land.  Thinking about the state of farming today, how many acres do you need  to farm to make a living?  Oh, you don   t have to have too many if you   ve got a good oil well.  That   s what has made the big farmers, here. That has helped this whole  country. Matter of fact, if you   ll go back over the history that was  another thing the Hickmans did, I don   t know how early, but they sold  half their royalty under all this land. Like her dad said, they kept the  land. Said he didn   t regret it at all. That was the only thing to do. But  that has made a big difference. The oil started here in the late    50s. It  was going when we got back here in    60 because we had a hard time  finding a place to live. They had the big boom and it kind of went bust  back there when the Penn Square Bank went under. That just about  ruined everybody around here. And it hurt the farmers just as well. They  were used to having income coming in.  I can remember one guy came in there at the seed house and he said,     Bill, my oil wells have quit and I know I owe you money.    He said,     I   ll pay you as I can.    I said,    That   s fine. It   s nice to know what is  going on.    And he did. Any time he got a little ahead, he   d come in and  pay it off. There is a lot of farms that went under about that same time.  We came awful close. When the banks jumped the interest from 9  percent to 18 and a half, there wasn   t any way. If you weren   t making it  to start with, and they jump the interest like that   my farm payments  just doubled. I had to file bankruptcy. They wouldn   t talk to me before. I  went in and sat in that bank all day long and the president wouldn   t even  talk to me. I filed bankruptcy and then they were wanting to talk.  (Laughter)  This is the time that Willie Nelson did the Farm Aid thing and this was a  suggestion, to file bankruptcy knowing you   ll not carry it out, but you   ll  get people to talk to you that wouldn   t before.  That was real   I mean, it was between day and night. We sat down in  arbitration, and I don   t know, he said something about how I was going  to make my payment that year and I said,    Well, if you   ll get the interest  down to where it is supposed to be, I can make it.    I said,    Otherwise,  35  G. Jones  B. Jones  Nykolaiszyn  B. Jones  Nykolaiszyn  B. Jones  Nykolaiszyn  B. Jones  G. Jones  B. Jones  the lawyer is going to get it. He   s got the check right now and he   s  holding it until you guys decide what you   re going to do.    They dropped  the interest back from eighteen and a half to eight. I said,    If you   d have  done this to start with, we wouldn   t be sitting here.    So that   s how we  kept it.  Rough times.  At that time, Oklahoma was the most distressed as far as agriculture in  the  nation . In Oklahoma, Kingfisher County was the worst. Up on this  side of the river, this corner of the county, which is about one-fourth of  it   three-fourths of the people in trouble were in this area. It was all out  here in the sand where we hadn   t been getting rain.  So let   s fast forward to today. Kingfisher County seems like we   re  drilling left and right, now. Is that helping the farmers in the county,  today?  Oh, yes. A little over a year ago, they came in here and leased a lot of  land. Chesapeake Oil Company was the primary one. They were leasing  for four hundred dollars an acre.  Is that good or bad?  That   s a pretty darn good check. You figure four hundred dollars times  160     That   s a lot of money.  That   s for three years. If they don   t drill, you might have a chance to  lease it again. We don   t have much royalty because the Hickmans sold  all of it. When we bought this, we didn   t get any royalty at all because  one of the in-laws was in the oil business and said,    I think we need to  keep it.    So he kept it in Grandpa and Grandma   s name. Then they  decided to divide it up between the five kids. So they deeded the oil  minerals to the five kids for five years. No   twenty years. The twenty  years is up, it goes back to the parents, but the parents are gone by then.  So we wound up getting one-fifth of the half they had. Greta and her  brother split that so we got twenty acres. (Laughter) But that is more  than we had to start with.  Every time we get a check from one of them, we think, this is better than  what we had  (Laughter)  But we   ve got a neighbor here   let   s see, one, two, three   three miles  west of us hit one of the best oil wells in this area, back early. He was a  36  Nykolaiszyn  B. Jones  Nykolaiszyn  B. Jones  G. Jones  B. Jones  G. Jones  schoolteacher. I have no idea how much it made him, but they drilled all  around trying to hit that same zone and never did hit it. It made  millionaires out of them real quick. I guess he had all the minerals on it,  I don   t know.  It is interesting how you see that boom/bust and now we   re in that boom  again.  It has been that-a-way forever. They   ll hit a spot. My grandfather on my  mother   s side left here, and I don   t know when, but around 1920 or a  little bit before and moved to Tonkawa. There was a big oil deal up there  in what they call the Three Sands area. I had an uncle that was killed up  there. They came back to Hennessey in    41, I think. They stayed since  then. I know it was    41 because he bought a brand new Ford tractor.  They thought that was something else. It was small, but as long as you  used the Ford equipment on it, you were all right. You didn   t want to do  anything else. I got so mad at my grandpa because he wouldn   t let me  drive it. I had an older cousin that he would let drive. That didn   t make  any sense. I   d driven a bigger tractor than that. I never realized until just  a few years ago just how old I was. (Laughter) I was only six. I thought I  was big enough.  Looking at the next 100 years, what do you hope happens on the farm?  I wish I knew. The Centennial Farm will go to the middle daughter. That  is already decided. The reason for that   she will probably keep it the  longest. She lives furthest away, but yet she has an interest in it. She had  a special connection with her great-grandmother. They were just   their  birthdays were the same day.  They had all their birthday parties together.  There was just a connection there from the word    go.    When Greta was  pregnant, when she told her grandmother she was pregnant and going to  have a baby      Well, when?    She told her.    Oh, that is going to be on  my birthday.       Well, no, that   s a few days off.       No, it is going to be on  my birthday.    Sure enough, she was. (Laughter)  The Extension Homemaker group got together and had a birthday  brunch for my grandmother that lived up here. I was up there for that,  you know, celebrating her birthday. That afternoon, I had a doctor   s  appointment at Okeene with my doctor. My dad took me over there and  said,    No, I think I   m going to keep you.    All the time in the delivery  room, I kept looking up at the clock to see if we were going to make it  on grandma   s birthday. Sure enough, we did. So I think that was one  thing that made them especially close. Where is that picture of Carla and  37  Finchum  G. Jones  Finchum  B. Jones  Finchum  Nykolaiszyn  B. Jones  G. Jones  Finchum  B. Jones  Finchum  B. Jones  G. Jones  B. Jones  Finchum  B. Jones  Grandma? I thought you should see it.  And she   s the one that lived to be 100?  She was just almost 100. When my grandpa died, they were just a few  days short of celebrating their seventieth wedding anniversary. So they  had a long life together.  As we wrap up, do you have a favorite farm memory? Childhood,  current, anywhere in between?  I got it paid off.  Got it paid off, well that would be a good one.  Was that a happy day?  That was a happy day. (Laughter)  It sure was, wasn   t it?  What did you do to celebrate?  I think we went to eat at Ed   s for supper that night.  Didn   t burn the     Didn   t burn a thing. (Laughter)  I think my favorite memories were when my aunts and uncles and  cousins would come to help on the farm, some. I was very, very close to  my cousins. They lived quite a ways a way, but they all wanted a part of  the farm. I think that is probably my favorite memories. What are yours  other than   ?  I think it is the get-togethers when we started having them. It was a lot  of fun to have the whole bunch here. Like I said, they   d all chip in and  help. I remember one time, the only time we   ve ever done it, one cousin  bought a sack full of fresh roasting ears. I heard about smoking them on  the cooker. I   d already pulled the meat off, so we threw the corn on  there. It was really delicious. (Laughter) It wasn   t that much trouble.  Leave them in the shucks?  Leave them in the shuck. Have them wet and throw them in there. I  don   t know, fifteen minutes or so? It didn   t take any time at all. Cut the  38  G. Jones  B. Jones  G. Jones  B. Jones  G. Jones  Finchum  G. Jones  Finchum  B. Jones  G. Jones  Finchum  G. Jones  end off and you just peel the husk and stuff off. Just real easy.  He mentioned he started doing brisket for this. Now, when I call or send  out the letter or something, they   ll go,    Is Bill fixing brisket?     (Laughter) They all like that.  I   ll show you this. Our postmaster here decided he was going to deliver  the mail like they used to. So they   d line up all the mailboxes over by  the pond there just south of town. They   ve got a walkway around it. So  they had us all positioned around there. I don   t know what the gal   s  position was, but she was one of the main ones from the postal  department in Oklahoma City that came up.  They delivered our mail to us that day.  And here   s the couple that started all this mess. (Laughter)  You had asked for pictures of the house. The picture over the fireplace is  the log house. That   s where they first lived. Then they built this frame  house on it, and that   s where I grew up. The chicken houses were back  behind it. The barn out to the left.  Did you take baths in the kitchen?  Yes, I did. (Laughs) I   ll have to tell her about my accident, won   t I? I  had the tin tub in front of the potbellied stove. I got out of it and backed  up against it and I had a burn like that on my behind. (Laughter)  Number two tubs? Do you remember?  Most of them were.  But I   d take the first one, another would take the next one and daddy got  the last one. (Laughter)  Lots of good memories. Hard work, but good memories. Thank you so  much for sharing them with us today. It   s been a pleasure.  I don   t know whether you got much out of it or not, but we   ve loved it.  -------  -------
