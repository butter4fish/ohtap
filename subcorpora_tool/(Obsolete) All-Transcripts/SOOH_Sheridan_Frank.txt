 Little Thunder  Sheridan  My name is Julie Pearson-Little Thunder. Today is Saturday, May 4. I  am interviewing Cheyenne artist Frank Sheridan as part of the  Oklahoma Native Artists Project sponsored by the Oklahoma Oral  History Research Program at Oklahoma State University. We   re at  Frank   s home in El Reno. Frank, you specialize in beadwork and  cultural items. You do ledger painting. You   ve won numerous awards,  including the First Peoples  Fund  Community Spirit Award. You have  an MBA. You had your own store for a while. You   re currently employed  by the Cheyenne-Arapaho Tribe in the elder care program. Thank you  for taking the time to speak with me.  Thank you for coming. I consider it a privilege.  Where were you born, and where did you grow up?  I was born in Lawton, Oklahoma, August 27, 1950. I grew up in Kiowa  Country in Anadarko. I went to high school at Riverside Indian School.  Prior to graduating, I dropped out of school like a lot of my peer group  at that time, and there was a lady that worked at the BIA  Bureau of  Indian Affairs  that was instrumental in getting me to go back. She saw  potential in me, and, anyway, she helped me go back. Best thing that  happened after I graduated was leaving Anadarko, and I came up this  way. I can go on and on, so let   s go with your questions. (Laughter)  Brothers and sisters?  I am the last surviving sibling. Johnny was a brother. He was a Vietnam  veteran, a door gunner in Vietnam. He survived being shot down in a  helicopter crash. I had another brother, (he   s gone) Phillip Lee Botone. I  had another brother, Robert Keith Botone, and I had a sister, Erin Lynn  Botone. I have one full sister, Marian Hill, so it   s actually me and my  sister are the last siblings.  5  Little Thunder  Sheridan  Little Thunder  Sheridan  Little Thunder  Sheridan  What did your folks do for a living?  Dad was an artist. My mother worked for the BIA for years and years  and years. She worked in realty. As part of that, she developed a  research project involving Cheyenne genealogy from Sand Creek. She  has the most extensive Cheyenne genealogy of any person who   s done  the research, volumes and volumes and volumes.  What about your grandparents on either side?  My grandmother was Dulcie Bushyhead; grandfather was Fred  Bushyhead. Fred was primarily a farmer/laborer. On my mother   s side,  my Grandma Lena was Kiowa. Her maiden name was Two Hatchet, and  my grandfather, John Sheridan, he was basically a laborer. He worked at  the old Clinton Indian Hospital as a ambulance driver, and when the  program came along where one of the presidents put people to work,  (the CCC program, I believe) he worked for that awhile. He spoke fluent  Cheyenne. He spoke fluent Arapaho.  So you have some memories of     I have very pleasant memories of my Grandpa John and my Grandma  Lena, really good memories. My Grandpa John   s mother was Pipe  Woman, He'ooneva'e in Cheyenne, and that   s my hallmark. I   ve always  signed my artwork Pipe Woman. I   ve never signed my last name on it.  The reason I do that is because Pipe Woman, this is her, (shows photo)  she was known for her beadwork and craftwork. The things I do, the  bags, the bow cases, the cradle boards, parfleches, boxes, they knew the  origins of them greater than I did. They had utility for them.  Basically, through the work I do, I feel that I   m honoring her memory.  As I do these things, I talk to her spirit, her memory. I talk to her father.  Her father   s name was Moore. He was a Cheyenne chief, he was a arrow  keeper, and he was a medicine man. What people don   t know about  Moore, in order to be Arrow Keeper, they say you have to be full-blood  Cheyenne. Moore was half-Sioux. Moore   s father   s name was Eight  Horns. Moore   s mother   s name was Iron Woman. Eight Horns was  killed in the Black Hills fighting gold prospectors.  When my mother was a little child, she developed a sickness during the  winter, and doctors gave up on her. My grandpa and his cousin went  after Moore in an old, open Model-T to bring him back. This Cut Grass,  aka Moore, he doctored my mother, and when he got the material out of  her, he gave it to my grandpa, told him to go throw it in the wind. When  he came back in, he had a little white fish. He got it and blew it into my  6  Little Thunder  Sheridan  Little Thunder  Sheridan  Little Thunder  mother. He told my grandma and grandpa,    This little baby is going to  live to be a old, old, old lady, and when she goes on, they   re going to  find that little fish.    I put a lot of faith in the ability that Maheo gave that  old man to doctor my mother because we brung her home just yesterday  after a bout with pneumonia.  As Cheyenne we   re always thankful in that spiritual realm, offer thanks  every day, try to maintain that spiritual contact. The reality of it is while  Mom was in the hospital she was, how they say, talking to her mom, her  dad. In that sense, it scares some people, but in another sense, that taught  me and my daughters that this life we   re living right now is just  temporary, that spiritual life is forever. As a Cheyenne, I feel really  humble that I was brung up that way, to acknowledge things like that  and try to pass them on.  Thank you for sharing that story. What is your first memory of seeing  art?  My first memory     Or Native art.     as an adolescent, Southern Plains  Indian  Museum in Anadarko. We  lived about three blocks from there. I would go there, I   d go in, I   d look  at the stuff. I was always attracted to Cheyenne cultural items. I saw  them. In that adolescence, I had a feeling that they did belong to  someone before they got there. How did they acquire them? It   s like  some of the things we as Indian people have is an innate feeling about  things.  Then as I got older, I traveled, go to museums. I   d see these wonderful  cultural items behind museum glass, and there was no chance of the  curator letting me look at them and touch them until a few years ago  through First Peoples Fund. Got to go up to the Denver Art Museum. I  got to go into the basement, and, oh my gosh, my dreams came true.  I got to see all of the Cheyenne cultural items, some that was collected at  Sand Creek. Knowing the history of it, knowing the people that made  those things, knowing that they understood those things greater than I  did, it was such a privilege to see things that maybe some of my relatives  made back then. Some of the Lakota work is there because people think  I   m Cheyenne, but I am Kiowa, too. I   m also Sioux by blood. That   s my  recollection of first artwork.  What   s your first memory of making art?  7  Sheridan  Little Thunder  Sheridan  First memory, in Anadarko, I had to have been about ten, twelve. I found  a piece of wood, and I got a pencil, and I started drawing. I drew a eye,  and it was very, very good. I went,    Wow, I did that?    (Laughter) That   s  my first recollection.  My first recollection of adult artwork, as far as beading goes, I always  wanted to learn how to bead. My mother, Ruby, she was known for her  beadwork, her moccasins, her leggings, her ladies    dance purses, her  man   s dance belts. I came to her one time, I said,    Mama, Mama, Mama,  I want you to teach me to bead.    I brung her a handful of mismatched,  different-sized beads, and she just laughed at me. She did show me, but  that   s where I got my start as a adult, as far as the traditional aspect of it.  The other things that I do, there was no way to learn. There was no way  to have someone tell me,    You do it this way. You do it this way. You  do it this way.    As part of that cognitive process, you look at something,  and you figure it out. You think it   s about like this, and you think it   s  about like this. After you try it, it becomes second nature. You just do it.  As a production artist, sometimes to speed up and for inventory, I have,  like, patterns, and I do all my rough cut. Everything I do is a single  artistic piece because it   s all drawn individually and painted.  I wondered if you could talk   because cultures are always evolving and  changing and back in the   40s and   30s when there were all the beading  circles and people started to discourage the idea of men beading, can  you talk about when that started to change, maybe? Of course, it  depended on families, too.  I think among the Cheyenne, there was the beading guilds, if you will, of  the women, and it was really unusual for a male to do the beading. We  have a buckskin shirt that belonged to my Grandpa John that was made  in 1899. It was made by Moore, Cut Grass, for my grandpa. It   s still, the  buckskin is as soft as it was made yesterday. It   s in that bright yellow,  Cheyenne-smoked buckskin. You don   t see that buckskin anymore.  There are other men among the Cheyenne that did do beadwork early on  before I started, (I can   t think of their names right now) but it slowly  evolved. When I started, I started out on making Native American  church items: fans, gourds. I was taught by different ones. This is an  example of one of the things I do. It   s going to be a peyote gourd. It has  the purple heartwood, beaded with size thirteen cut beads, a single bead,  what they call a gourd stitch. I have the birds. I do my own lathe work.  As you develop these things, you start from just a piece of wood, then  you go down.  As far as beading, the other things that I   ve done, I   ve done buckskin  8  Little Thunder  Sheridan  Little Thunder  Sheridan  Little Thunder  dresses. I did a really beautiful buckskin dress for my ex-wife, and it  took me about eleven months. My mother showed me how. Gladys  Parton showed me how to cut it out. I   ve done moccasins, leggings. I   ve  learned from different ones. The technique of beading, I picked up from  my mother. She would take me to different relatives of hers so they  could tell me how to do the right cuts and that type of thing.  Two ladies that really encouraged me as far as the beading aspect, one  was Bertha Little Coyote. Another one was Evelyn White Crane.  They   re both my mother   s aunts. Over a period of time your skills  develop. The abstract thought process, you look at something, and you  claim ownership, and you modify it, and you make it your own. Over the  years, the ledger work that I do, a lot of people have told me that people  copy my work, but I think that   s really flattering and complimentary.  (Laughter) I   ve done book covers. I   ve been in Native Peoples  magazine. I   ve done all types of work, and it   s always evolving. Even  today my work is evolving. Everything I do evolves.  So pretty much your art experiences, aside from making that eye  at Riverside in middle school or high school, they weren   t too  significant? Nothing stands out in your mind?  Nothing really, really stands out until my, basically, young adult life.  Actually, it   s like I had a need. I had a need. I had a desire. I wanted to  learn. I wanted to learn about my Cheyenne people, what they did, how  they lived, the history, the culture, the traditions, the songs, why they did  this, why they used this color.  I did something one time for my daughter Helen that stays here. Well,  Heather, Helen, Holly, and Hannah watched my mother really do it, but  I made a smoked buckskin shawl for my daughter Helen. I was really,  really proud of it. It had buckskin fringe on it. It looked like what they  call tipi liner. It was beautiful. I happened to use a version of a  Cheyenne woman   s military stripe design that had some black in there.  They said,    Why   d you use black for? Cheyennes are supposed to use  bright, pretty colors     After that, I   m really cautious about using black. I  use it sparingly. That was a learning experience, but she still has that  shawl today. I haven   t ever seen another beaded buckskin shawl.  Now, you did go to college. Where did you attend school?  I started out here in El Reno at the junior college when it was up at the  old post office downtown. After I graduated from here, I transferred to  OCU in Oklahoma City and finished up.  What was your major?  9  Sheridan  Little Thunder  Sheridan  Little Thunder  Sheridan  Education. I wanted to teach, and I got the opportunity to teach after I  graduated. I taught fourth and fifth grade in a open classroom out at  Concho. I was out there for, like, fourteen years, and I was on adjunct  staff at OCU for three years. Then when I worked for Indian Health  Service, I was a community intervention specialist, and I was still  teaching.  I have done conferences all over the United States. I   ve keynoted  conferences. It was always talking about our culture relevant to  wellness, our culture relevant to domestic violence, our culture relevant  to alcohol and substance abuse, and I was still teaching. I   m still  teaching now where I work in a different sense.  So when did you sort of   and you may always have been working full-time  and also doing your cultural items and your beadwork, but when  did you start entering shows and entering competitive shows with your  work?  Oh, gosh, that   s really   I really can   t remember, but I remember going  to the different shows and seeing the work there, seeing some of the  work that won. I thought that was really, really nice, and I thought my  work was just as good. The first piece I ever entered, I think, was a  miniature beaded Cheyenne cradle. Mom helped me with the design.  She told me about the design. She   s taught me everything I know about  beading. The woodwork and stuff, I cut my own wood. It looked like, in  the photographs, (I   ve got a picture of it someplace; I   ll grab it in a little  bit) it looked like a full-sized cradle. You couldn   t tell the difference,  and that won Best of Show. On the pieces     Was it here in Oklahoma at Red Earth?  I believe at Red Earth. I   ve won Best of Show at Cherokee. I   ve won  Best of Division at Indian Market. I   ve gotten their Governor   s Award. I  don   t really like expressing that part because you   re not really supposed  to talk about yourself like that. Behind me, that skull up there, that   s my  little   it   s kind of heavy to lift. There   s medals and ribbons.  It   s not so much the competition as it   s showing what my history is,  what my people did. Whenever I   m fortunate to place, I feel it   s  representing them. It   s a way of keeping their memory alive, and I   m not  saying that to sound any other way. That   s just the way it is with me. I  believe in that spiritual aspect of self. I believe that the good that you do  comes back. I believe that you should help those that can   t help  themselves.  10  Little Thunder  Sheridan  Little Thunder  Sheridan  Little Thunder  Sheridan  Little Thunder  I   ve helped a lot of people through my artwork, through donations. I   ve  donated it to American Cancer Society, American Heart Foundation,  diabetes programs, donated my artwork for various posters all over,  even some organization in DC. I   m honored when they ask me to do that  because in a way that   s teaching, too. The theme of my drawing     they   re going to have a Cheyenne-Arapaho HIV youth powwow coming  up, July or so. They asked me to design a t-shirt for them. I   ll show you  the design a little bit later. I got it in here, the one that   s going to be on  their shirt. By doing that, I can help people that I don   t even know.  At some point, you decided to pursue a master of arts in teaching. What  prompted that?  I felt a need to   in our ceremonies, it   s like in non-Indian society.  You   re in grade school, go to junior high, graduate from high school,  maybe go to junior college, go to college, get a bachelor   s, get a  master   s. In our tradition, it   s that way. There are certain things that you  do through our traditions that bring you up within that level, Priest being  the upper level and different places down.  I   ve participated in our ceremonies five times. Whenever asked, I paint,  I sing, the drum. Help out any way I can. As far as pursuing my master   s  in that regard, I felt that there were other things that I could learn,  different techniques yet, not that I   ve really used any of them, but having  that appreciation of world art, the Masters, the real, you know. It   s just  having that appreciation for it.  You talked about the importance for you of being able to actually handle  and see and experience cultural items, Cheyenne cultural items. I was  wondering what your first important museum exhibit was, and why it  was important to you.  Southern Plains Museum. That is where I found pride because that   s  where I found pride. That   s where I found humbleness. That   s where I  found memories.  Did you deal with any galleries in Oklahoma very much during the    70s  or    80s?  There was a gallery in Norman. I don   t remember what it was. There  was the standard Red Earth Gallery. There was a gallery in Santa Fe.  I can   t remember the name of it. There   s   up in Rapid City. My work   s,  like, all over.  Was your focus booth shows, though, or was it split between galleries  and booth shows?  11  Sheridan  Little Thunder  Sheridan  Little Thunder  Sheridan  Little Thunder  Sheridan  Little Thunder  Sheridan  Little Thunder  Sheridan  Little Thunder  Sheridan  Little Thunder  Sheridan  My focus was primarily, I would say, the booth shows. It allowed me to  meet other people. It allowed me to make a lot of different friends. It  allowed me to trade for other people   s work that I admired. Even Merlin   Little Thunder  has some of my work. (Laughter)  Yes, we got a hand drum from you.  I   ve got some of his work. That   s how it works.  That is a fun thing about booth shows. Then you got an MBA in  business. Did you already know you were   were you thinking about  going into business for yourself at that point?  I definitely thought about it. I thought if I went through that, I probably  might, but it was good from the standpoint of marketing and sales and  all of those things that you use as a independent artist. You do your own  marketing. You do a lot of the MBA first chapter 101 stuff, you know?  Right. (Laughs)  The same all over.  That is the hard part, I think. The business part of art is sometimes the  hardest part. What was difficult for you?  I think some of the collectors, from attorneys to doctors   there   s  different kinds of collectors. There   s those that really appreciate it, your  work, and they understand it, and then there   s those collectors that think  they   re at a garage sale. That was the hardest part, working with those  collectors, so I gradually didn   t go to them anymore. I didn   t need to.  You had your own store for a while, right?  Yes, just, it wasn   t for very long. It was just a try.  Were you working a nine-to-five job while you had the store, too?  Yes.  What were the challenges of that? (Laughs)  Finding extra time to do the things you needed to do to make it a  success. Had my children (they were younger) then. It was fun. I think  now that I   m an elder, I think I could do it. I think I could do it primarily  on my own inventory. Starting small, I think I could do it, getting other  12  Little Thunder  Sheridan  Little Thunder  Sheridan  people   s inventory like the other galleries do, on consignment. I   m  pretty sure I could, but I   m working again, now. I retired after twenty-nine  years, twenty-nine weeks, twenty-nine days for Indian Health  Service. Then I went back to work.  Well, congratulations. (Laughs) That   s a lot. You won First Place at  Santa Fe Indian Market here not too long ago, 2007, for a piece called  Pipe Woman Purse. Can you talk a bit about your inspiration for that  piece?  I got a picture of it back there I can grab if you want to pause. I   ll get it  in a little bit.  Sure.  This is the purse that you were talking about. It can be found on the  internet. Type in    Frank Sheridan Cheyenne purse.    You can also type  in    Frank Sheridan Cheyenne horse mask.    I   ve seen a lot of purses that  were beaded and stuff, and I specialize in rawhide. I specialize in  drawing on rawhide. Rawhide   s really hard to draw on because of the  surface of the skin. It   s like drawing on sandpaper, and in order to get a  smooth line you have to, like, sometimes make your heart stop and go so  you don   t shake. What it was, I wanted to do something that was a little  different that represented the Cheyenne-ness of what we do.  Among our people, there were ways for courting. I   ve heard some of  those stories, and of course, I did a courting scene. Then on each side for  balance (as a artist, you know, you balance) I put two abstract parfleche  designs from about 1880-something. I put tipis at the top. He   s playing a  flute for his lady. She   s standing there in a shawl and her cloth dress.  She has a parasol. People would say,    How come you put parasols,  umbrellas?    Well, when they would go on raids, they would come back,  and maybe there   s a parasol or something. They would hand out the  good sprinklies, and that   s why she had the parasol. It must be a serious  courting because he   s got trade goods on the ground, he   s got a bucket,  he   s got a horse there. Then on the sides of the purse, the strap going up,  that   s a rawhide line that has a red cloth backing on the back.  I have simulated tobacco ties. I have old eagle quarters. It   s beaded in  that military stripe design, all kinds of bells and whistles, so to speak. It  has rolled fringe on each of the four corners, really long hand-rolled  fringe, bells. It   s lined with calico, and there   s serrated deer dew claws  on it. It   s a piece that, as I was working on it, I was listening to   in my  studio, as you could tell when you came in, I have all kinds of music  going, and I was listening to some of our ceremonial music from  recordings from Cheyenne Sun Dance. It just kept going and going and  13  Little Thunder  Sheridan  Little Thunder  Sheridan  going and going. Anyway, it finally ended up finished, and I was  honored to have won that. On the back side of this purse, there was a  drawing of a Cheyenne Dog Soldier sitting with one hip on a rock,  holding his bow, had his shield, got that typical Cheyenne suave, you  know, like,    Come on     (Laughter) That was a privilege doing that.  The strap on that was similar to this one. This is one that I use  sometimes. It   s got a version of the military stripe, the horsehair tassels.  On my stuff, I use actual tobacco and things that we use. On stuff I sell, I  don   t. It   s just simulated. Elk   s tooth, little turtle. Any time I use a turtle,  it is for my mother. She has a turtle collection that you would not  believe. (Laughter) Actually, some other stuff I   ll show you after while,  we   ll be going along that direction, but that   s the purse.  This is the cradle board I was telling you about, the cut beads. This is the  one Mom told me how to bead, helped me with the design. This is  another example of my ledger drawing. After I won the award at First  Peoples Fund, a couple years later I donated one of my drawings for  their program, and that   s one of my drawings. I have fun doing that. Any  time I   m asked, I   m more than glad to donate my work. It   s blessed me,  as any artist, financially.  More recent, this past November, I was contacted by Emil Her Many  Horses    museum in DC   s Smithsonian National Museum. To this day, I  don   t know how he found me because when I retired, I dropped out of  sight. No one knew where I was. He called me one day in my office out  there and explained it. He said,    I have a commission for you at five  thousand dollars if you can do me five of your ledger drawings, no  restrictions, however you want to be represented.    I   m like,    Okay.     That was a pleasure because the drawings I did were really  representative of Cheyenne. I think they were the best drawings I ever  did, and it was a five-thousand-dollar commission.  And they were going to the National Museum of the American Indian?  Yes, the permanent collection. As a token of appreciation, I gifted Mr.  Her Many Horses two of my original ledger drawings.  Can you talk a little bit about your approach to ledger drawings?  They   ve been pretty popular. A lot of artists have been doing ledger art.  First of all, on my original, my old, old, old-style contemporary  interpretation, this is some of the paper that I use. It   s out of Mom   s  collection, what she has, some of the actual ledger names that were  written by the Indian agents as the Cheyennes turned themselves in as  they came in. In those ledgers, there were some blank pages. My supply  14  Little Thunder  Sheridan  is really, really limited. Some of those pages, there   s places where the  Indian agent, or whoever was writing, tested their pen to the back, and I  can use parts of those pages. Some of these names on here, Henry Bear,  Thomas Bear Above, Bear Behind, it   s got his wife, it   s got his children,  got his grandchildren, dating back to 1888, 1884. That   s the type of  genealogy that my mother does.  While we   re on the subject of the ledger drawings, this is one of my  ledger drawings. It   s a Cheyenne warrior scene. The top rider has the  traditional Cheyenne upright bonnet. He   s carrying a lance. He has a  ribbon flowing off of his war bonnet. He has on a captured cavalry  jacket that he took the sleeves off to make the vest. He   s got arm bands  on. He   s got his shield on. He   s got his trailer of broadcloth coming  down with the eagle feathers on it. His horse tail is wrapped with red  cloth. There   s medicine feathers on his horse   s forehead.  The bottom rider has a tailed war bonnet, basically the same thing. Has  his braids, has breastplate, horse   s tail. The ears, the Cheyenne would  split their pony   s ears as a way of endearment. A lot of the other tribal  ledger drawings, they don   t do that. The Cheyennes were the only ones,  if you look at the old ones. This is done with waterproof technical inks.  I   ve used crayons as they were done with originally. I   ve used all types  of material. This is mainly the work I   m known for. It   s in a traditional  style but my contemporary adaptation of it.  This is one that I need to paint. This is a battle scene. It   s six Cheyenne  warriors, various state of riding horses. Some of them carry coup sticks  with eagle feathers, enemy lances, the straight-up war bonnet, the horse  tracks. It   s in that style of the original ledger drawings, and as you can  see, the Pipe Woman signature. Sometimes I   ll do my drawings with  half horses coming out here because that   s the way they were done.  Another one real quickly, this one was a t-shirt design that I need to  paint. It   s a Cheyenne Warrior, the abstract, parfleche designs on the  side. The two tracks are buffalo tracks. He   s carrying a crook lance. He  has a captured saber hanging in front of him. He   s got his bow case  decorated with ermine tail, eagle feathers, again, signed    Pipe Woman.     Really nice.  This is one that I drew and donated to   Nancy Johnson is a social  worker with Indian Health Service. She   s been working with Gloria  Zuniga out at Cheyenne-Arapaho Tribes. Nancy put some money with  Gloria   s program, HIV money, and part of that money they   re going to  use to sponsor this youth powwow. They asked me if I would donate a  drawing for their t-shirt, so this is going to be the drawing for the  Cheyenne-Arapaho Youth HIV Powwow.  15  Little Thunder  Sheridan  Little Thunder  Sheridan  Little Thunder  Again, it   s one of my contemporary-style ledger drawings interpretation.  This is normally how I do the abstract parfleche design I have on there.  This, specifically, is part of a Cheyenne parfleche design. The ladies  have Cheyenne-smoked buckskin dresses. They have parasols. The hair  is so clean, it   s shiny. That   s the shiny streaks in it. The older, taller lady  has Cheyenne crosses on hers. The smaller, younger child has mountains  on hers. They have their pouch sets, knife case, awl case. I did this  within, like, two evenings because I had responsibilities of work and I  knew it was coming up. That   s called working under pressure. I   m sure  Merlin   s done that before. (Laughter)  That   ll be a great t-shirt.  This is one of my favorite interpretations. That   s a Cheyenne Dog  Soldier, straight-up war bonnet, his bow case, ledger ponies with split  ears, that abstract parfleche design, arrow sticking in the ground,  captured enemy saber.  That   s gorgeous.  One more. The wording on here, this was a t-shirt design. What it is, it   s  a Cheyenne woman in a dentalium dress. Sleeves are beaded. She   s  holding a wing fan. There   s willow leaves, willow branches on the side  of her, her camp behind her. There   s dragonflies in the willows. She   s  sitting on a blanket, and the words in front of it are,    Heaven, Clouds,  Health, Well-Being, Exist. It is that way.    (Sings in Sioux) Sioux words,  Sioux song, that   s the translation of it, like someone gets well in sweat,  someone   s praying. You want them to get well. That   s an example of the  songs we use in sweat.  I   ve done this drawing one time before, similar. I called it Waits For  Him. What that was symbolic of was when my brother was in Vietnam,  he was a door gunner. My mother, as well as other Cheyenne mothers,  would pray, and fathers and grandfathers go to peyote meetings. The  title of the drawing I did similar was called Waits For Him, representing  my mother waiting for her son to come home.  Ledger drawings, traditionally, were done after exploits that the warriors  did, war exploits. In our Cheyenne society today, you   re not supposed to  say anything unless it   s that way. Traditionally, in the drawings, they  couldn   t depict something if it wasn   t that way. They didn   t realize it at  the time, but it was recording history like we   re doing with this. There   s  a lot of different interpretations, but that   s some of my ledger drawings.  Thank you for sharing those.  16  Sheridan  Little Thunder  Sheridan  Little Thunder  Sheridan  Little Thunder  Sheridan  I didn   t mean to go that long, but   . (Laughter)  No, it was great. When you were nominated for that First Peoples  Community Spirit Award (and it goes specifically to Native artists who  are really community-centered and involved with their communities)  you were nominated by another bead artist, Teri Greeves, who   s a very  well-known bead worker as well. How did you find out you were  nominated?  I got a letter from First Peoples Fund.  You didn   t know.  No. They said the selection was based off of the time when I was  working for Indian Health Service. Me and Nancy Johnson and Harold  Barst worked with a group of Vietnam combat veterans that were in  outpatient treatment for combat-related post-traumatic stress disorder,  and we would meet with them twice a week. It takes a while before any  of the veterans in that group would really open up, but over three or four  years that we worked with them, they got real close. We   d sit with them,  listen to them, their stories, hear them cry, hear them pray. We   d have  sweats for them pretty regularly, and that was the basis of being  community-oriented. Two years later, Nancy was nominated for that  same award by me for basically the same and working with that combat  veterans group.  I   ve got a lot of respect for veterans. I   m not a veteran myself. My uncle  recently passed. He was a Korean War veteran. He participated in Pork  Chop Hill, and my youngest daughter Hannah   s in the Navy right now.  That flag you see hanging there, that blue star, back during the Second  World War, you would see blue stars and gold stars, gold star mothers     anyway. I don   t know how I got off on that. (Laughter)  Since you mentioned Hannah and her service, you told me a wonderful  story about your beaded horse mask. It   s taken this whole journey since  you made it, but you started off winning a prize with that one, too.  Maybe can you just start with talking about that?  I   m the only Cheyenne artist I know that is making horse masks. My  first awareness of a horse mask   I   ve got the book someplace I can   t  recall. I   ve had a lot of things going on this past week. There was a mask  that came up for auction that was found in a book, and the provenance  on it, it was made by a Cheyenne woman for her husband. There   s a  actual photograph of that mask on a horse. I believe you might know  what I   m referring to. I   ve got it in one of my books up here. I   ll grab  17  the book.  My first association with Cheyenne horse masks came when I was  looking on the internet, and I saw this mask that was in a box. I tried to  do some more research on it, and then I found out about this book on  American Indian horse masks. I ordered it, and in reading about it I  found out that mask was made by   there was a man, his name was He  Bear. It was made by his wife. Her name was Buffalo Wallow Woman.  That really gave me pride because I had seen them before, and I never  knew how to make one. No one ever said,    Frankie, make your mask  like this. You do this.     What I did at first, I   ve got one started someplace, but I don   t want to  pause no more. (Laughter) What I did at first, I made a pattern. With that  pattern, I went up to the vet, and they had some horses.    Would you  mind if I tried this on your horse?       What?       Would you mind   .     (Laughter) They let me, and I modified my pattern to where it fit over  the eyes.  After I did that, I brung the mask back. Then, that cognitive process,  how is a mask made? Well, one, it   s got to be on buckskin. Two, it   s got  to be decorated. In looking at some of these, I found one really, really,  really similar to the one I did. What I liked about it was the fact that it  had all of these antique buttons on it, military jacket buttons, and I   m  known for using antique military jacket buttons. This is the one that I  saw, so that was inspiration.  That mask, you can see on the internet. Type in    Frank Sheridan  Cheyenne horse mask.    I beaded it. After I beaded it, I thought,    What   s  next?    Well, you   ve got to put the horns on there. People say,    When  you do horns, use glass.    No  You got to use power tools. I had a  grinder, and it took about three hours, seriously, just to get the outer  layers off and get it kind of smooth then sand it smooth again. Then after  that, cutting it. Then after cutting it, cutting it off. Interesting about horn,  when you cut it right down the middle, you   ve got a duplicate image. If  the horn   s curving this way, when you do the other side   . Those are the  horse masks up there.  No one showed me how to put them on. I figured out how to put them  on, how they had to have put them on. The next step was   there   s more  to it than that. I found that on a horse mask there   s the front panel, the  front part where the eyes and beadwork and horse is. There   s two side  panels where the fringe and everything is on both sides, and then there   s  a nose panel. You put those on. After that was all done, you can see all  the back side. That   s not good.  18  I took it to a seamstress and asked if she could sew red material on there,  so she did the red material for me. Then I brung it back and I sat   I   ve  had this table forty years, okay. It   s a old Sun Dance table that we left  down at work, and I put a piece of plywood board on it. Anyway, I got  my Sun Dance paint and used the colors on it just like you see it there,  the red and green, and did the tie straps. It was done; showed it a few  places. It was on the internet. It   s still listed as ten thousand dollars,  what I wanted.  I had two serious offers for eight thousand, but I don   t know because of  the thing of there   s those collectors who think they   re at a garage sale.  It   s not a garage sale. It took a while. My Aunt Eloise (you know her)  Rice, she had a memorial dance for her mother, Grandma Elsie. She  wanted to use Hannah as Honored Veteran, so we told Hannah. Hannah  came home. As Cheyennes, we   re taught, one, when you honor  someone, give the best you have. Give the best you have, so we got all  the other stuff, the shawls, the Pendletons, everything. Then I got my  daughter here, and I got my mom and her sisters, and I got that mask  down. I said,    Hannah, I love you very, very, very much. I   m going to  give this away for you.       Daddy, no        It   s going to be that way.    We  go to the dance; she brings colors in and all that.  I also gave away   when they used to give away rifles, they would give  away .22s. I   m the first one that gave away a semi-automatic assault  weapon with a bayonet on it. I did that. I   ve seen that happen before. For  Hannah, two things I gave away, the best I had, I gave away that brand  new SKS to Eddie Wilson because on the staff that Hannah carried, this  family crook staff, behind my bustle there   s a enemy NVA helmet that  was picked up at Ia Drang Valley. I had that on there as a war trophy.  Eddie Wilson was a medic at Ia Drang Valley. He survived it. After that,  before I gave away that mask, I called Eddie up and had someone carry  it around, traditional Cheyenne style, holler four times, present it. He  cried because I told his war story for him.  Then I said,    I   ve got something very special to give away for my  daughter Hannah Shyela Sheridan. I   m very proud of her. Her  grandmother, her sisters, her aunt. At this time, the person I   m going to  call is not here, but we want to honor him, and because he   s not here,  we   re going to mail it to him. At this time, I would like a representative  for Phillip White Man Jr. come up and receive this gift.    At that dance,  the last item to be given away for Hannah Shyela, my daughter who   s in  the Navy, stationed in Florida   she   s a Master at Arms. When the ships  go out and she   s on a boat, she mans the twin .50s. She likes that. I  called out, I said,    At this time, I would like a representative for Phillip  White Man Jr. from Montana, come shake hands with my daughter and  receive this gift.    People were just shocked because you give your best.  19  That   s how I   m taught. You give your best. Gave away a brand new, it  was an AK-47 with bayonet and that mask. I told them,    He   s not here,  so we   re going to mail it to him.     I got pictures of Hannah holding it and all that. Then we took her to the  city square, and we had it packaged. She wrote a little note in there, and  we mailed it and told Phillip why I did it. In turn, he thanked me and all  that. This dance was, I think, it was in the fall. Then Denver March  coming up, it was a little before that. Phillip   s step-daughter, him, and  his wife (I forget her name), she had just come back from her second  combat tour in Afghanistan. She   s a warrior woman. In turn, Phillip  gave that mask away for his daughter at Denver March Powwow. He put  that mask on a pony, led it into the arena. I wasn   t there, but he and other  people told me,    You could   ve heard a pin drop.     That   s what Cheyennes are taught to do. Some people might interpret  that as,    You   re just showing off.    No. It   s,    What are you willing to  give to get what you ask the Creator for?    I   m willing to give   . When I  prayed for my mother, that she come home, I told Maheo,    I   m willing  to give part of my life that my mother can come home again.    That   s  what we   re taught as Cheyenne with that same concept. That   s what I  did with Hannah, giving that away. I   m the only one that I know of that  makes these masks. I   ve got two others up there. The one in the middle  is where I had that. I was offered eight thousand dollars two times for it,  and I didn   t do it.  I have another story. When I went to Eiteljorg  Museum , I did a  Cheyenne boy   s bow case similar to this one. This is the strap that   s  going to go on it. It was beaded and decorated. Same thing: It won First,  Best of Category, whatever it was. It won. One man came by twice. First  time,    How much?    I let him look at it. He said he   d be back. Second  time he came by, he said,    I have eight thousand dollars cash I   ll give  you for that bow case.    I said,    Sir, I really, really appreciate you  showed me eight thousand dollars cash, but I can   t. I   m sorry. I have to  have ten.    He said,    If I go, I   m not going to come back.    I told him,     Well, I appreciate it very, very much.     That Christmas, I gave that to my grandson because I   ve got my  grandfather   s shirt in there. That   s my prized possession. Someday, that  bow case with the ribbons and everything that went with it, that   s going  to be my grandson   s prized possession. He   s fourteen now. That was  when he was still a little kid. That   s part of that   in a sense, these are  like material things, but it   s a gift that God gave me. To show him I   m  thankful for that gift, I give.  We had a sweat here for my daughter or someone. I had a mate to this  20  knife. This is a Cheyenne bear jaw knife. Someone came to pray for, I  think it was my daughter when we was sitting down here eating. Those  kind of sweats, we   d give away. I said,    We   ve got a visitor here that  came a long ways to pray for my daughter. At this time, I want him to  come up and accept   .    It was the other knife case for my daughter. My  daughter just went   she got well. That   s what I was willing to give. I   m  not anyone special. That   s the way I was taught by my mother that   s  hopefully going to recuperate more in there from the stories she told me  from Sand Creek about her mom, about her grandma, about her dad,  about her mother, about her brother. I   m just thankful to Maheo that  she   s home.  We   re going to work with hospice starting Monday, and long as I have  her, I   m never going to leave her. She   s my queen. That   s how come I  dropped out. I don   t do shows anymore. I   ve got someone very, very  special in there. I was telling my daughters,    If this was a long time ago  and our camp was attacked and your grandma got hurt or got shot, you  would tell the man, Helen, you would tell Tommy,    Take Christian and  Hayden. Go on. I   ll be okay.    Holly, you would tell your man,    Take  Hazel. Take Harper. You   ll be okay. Go on. I   m going to stay with my  grandma.    You girls would have grabbed her. You would have taken her  off in the brush someplace, protected her. That   s what you   re doing right  now. That   s what you   re doing. You may not realize it. You didn   t leave  her.     Philosophically, traditionally, we look at things differently. That   s just  like, I   ve been ordering some books, (I   m an elder now) really good  books I know of for my daughters. I knew this lady. She would come  over and visit my grandpa, and they would sit outside and drink coffee  and talk in Cheyenne. She lived two streets down. I knew Joe. I knew  Clark. I knew his brother. I knew Kathy. I knew Maude.  I have a photograph that was taken at Southern Plains Museum of my  mother in a buckskin dress, two other ladies in a buckskin dress, Mary  Inkanish in a buckskin dress. I   ve got that picture. I   ve ordered another  book. The set of this, I had the originals. Someone borrowed them and  never returned them. I   m never going to loan my books again. (Laughs)  A lot of the stuff that I   ve learned, I passed it to a lot of people.  Years ago, there was a northern Cheyenne man. He was mom   s grandpa,  Wesley White Man. He was the last Cheyenne contrary. When he passed  away, through his family he told them that he had some medicine that he  wanted me to have it. I asked around first because I was kind of scared  of it. I asked Roy Bull Coming and others. Roy said,    I know what that  old man has. He must think a lot of you. Take it.     21  When I did take it, (and they gave me his pipe) I took it up to the  hospital, stood in front of mom, prayed with it. I handed it to her. She  looked at it, and she went. (Gestures) She looked out her window. She  held it out. I told you, she had one foot over. She said,    This is my  grandfather   s medicine. He wanted Frankie to have it. Frankie   s helped a  lot of people with it. Maybe he can help me with it.    Then she closed her  hand, and she doctored herself with it. She don   t know how to do that.  Traditions like that. I don   t normally tell that story, but it is a strong  medicine.  I   ve made pipes for people. My Grandpa Allen, a long time ago made  my first pipe, Allen Bushyhead. I was really proud. He said,    Don   t  make any more just yet.    He said,    I   m going to take you somewhere.     Next week, he come over. He said,    Get in.    He took me to Longdale to  see that Red Hat, that old man Arrow Keeper. He talked to him in  Cheyenne. On the way up there, he was telling me a long time ago there  were certain people in our tribe who used to make these. They are very  powerful. He said,    I love my grandchildren, my children. At the time I  don   t want anything to happen to them. I   m going to take you to this  Arrow Keeper, ask permission.    He got a grocery basket and all that. I  had an extra pipe, and he took me up there. He talked to him in  Cheyenne and looked at the pipe I made.  When I Sun Danced back in    70,    71,    72,    73, and    85, the pipe I used, I  made myself. I still have that pipe. My son   s pipe when he went in, I  made it. The pipe that Holly   s going to use, I made hers. Anyway, my  story. That old man looked at it, and he talked in Cheyenne to Grandpa  Allen. Then he looked at me. He said,    Your grandpa is right. Certain  people used to make these. I   m going to give you permission to make  them for our ceremonial people.    He said,    When you make them, just  pray for that person you   re making it for, and through that you   ll get a  blessing.    I don   t tell that story, but I was given permission to make  pipes by that old man Red Hat. I do a little bit of everything.  It   s all a spiritual process. Whenever I am doing work, I go into that  place where these things belong, even through the music I listen to.  Sometimes I need to get away from that place. It gets a little strong, so I  put on my reggae or my Motown   back here by myself dancing.  (Laughter) Then I get back to it.  One of the things that Morning Star   s camp, (   battle of the Washita,     like they say in the movies) after they raided these places, all those  things of Cheyenne beauty, they got them, and they burned them. I   m  trying to keep a little of those people alive. I never really call myself an  artist. It   s just something I do. My children are picking it up, my  daughter Helen. My grandson Christian made a box at Red Earth last  22  Little Thunder  Sheridan  Little Thunder  Sheridan  time I did it, years ago. He won First Place in it. All my children can do  something. It   s just something I really, really enjoy doing. I believe that  I was destined to do what I do, but Mama had to be part of it. Every-thing  happened when it was supposed to happen. Through the stuff I  do     Nobody else is making these.  Yes. There   s burial flag display boxes, the wooden ones, and all that.  Our Indian boys, they fought. This is something from the heart that   s  traditional. My brother   s flag is laying on a bed of sage. Recently, Sam  Hart   s widow, Delores Hart, had a birthday, and I had just finished one. I  asked his daughter who I work with,    Jenny, what was his rank?    I knew  he was in the Marines, not Marines, Corpsmen. Anyway, I wrote     United States Marines, Samuel (his middle initial) Hart,    when he was  born, when he passed away. I put it in a nice gift bag, put a bow on it. I  called her daughter, told her to give it to her mom for her birthday.  That   s what we   re taught to do: give.  Maybe through that, maybe God remembered that, and that   s how come  my mother got to come home. Maybe all these things I   ve donated, God  remembers, and he   s given my mother a little more time. Maybe he   s  going to help me with my back. If I have to do my back surgery again, I  would, but I know I   ll never be the same. I   m limited in what I can do,  but I thank God I can do what I can do and still do my artwork. It   s  always a privilege and a honor to do anything relating to our Cheyenne  people. Next question.  You   ve said so many good things. I guess it would be whatever you   d  like to add that you don   t think we   ve covered.  There   s an item that you see standing up by the TV. There   s a black  handkerchief hanging on it. It   s beaded. It   s over eight foot long. When I  was at the Denver Art Museum, that   s on the websites that supposedly is  a Cheyenne Dog Soldier sash. In that museum, it says,    Cheyenne?  Arapaho? Sioux?    No one actually knows. I was a mentor to Nancy  Johnson. She does some beautiful beadwork. My mom adopted her in  our family. She gave her a Cheyenne family name, Hest  hk  ha'e, Twin  Woman. She   s a mother of twins.  We did a joint project through her First Peoples Fund Award. She got  the materials to make two Cheyenne-style Dog Soldier sashes. It took  over a year, on and off. It   s lined on the back with red material. There   s  symbolic things on it. There   s medicines on them. She did hers to honor  her dad who was William Jimmy. He was Choctaw-Chickasaw, and  during the Korean War he was a machine gunner. He fought at Pork  23  Little Thunder  Sheridan  Chop Hill.  When I was doing mine, I was doing it to represent my brother Johnny  Botone and to honor my uncle who I   m named after, Frank Thomas  Sheridan. In doing the research, we found out that Nancy   s father fought  at Pork Chop Hill. He never told anyone. We found that out. I found out  that my Uncle Frank fought at Pork Chop Hill. He never told anyone.  We found out, and we made these sashes. Down at the bottom, there   s  even that earth peg that they stick themselves to the ground with. I   ll go  back there and hold it up a little bit.  Or I can even take a picture. I   ll take a camera, and we   ll take a still  picture.  This warrior sash is similar to one that   s in the Denver Art Museum. As  I said, mine was done to honor my brother Johnny Botone, my uncle  Frank Thomas Sheridan, and now that my daughter   s in the military (she  wasn   t at the time) it honors her down to the earth peg when they stick  themselves in. Among warriors, Cheyenne Dog Soldiers, they would  make a vow if they were in dire straits, peg themselves out, and make a  vow to fight there. Some other cultures do that. Some of the Eastern  cultures do that, tie their legs up and stuff.  The interesting part about this, there was two made. If you put them both  together, you couldn   t tell who made them, me or Nancy. The thing  about it, we had permission. What she was going to do with hers, we  was going to put a tipi out here. We was going to call chiefs and  societies and feed them, and she was going to give hers to the Dog  Soldiers. They don   t have one. We were going out to see   I   m just  going to say it. He   s my brother, Chester. We was going to set it up, tell  him about it. In fact, took it out there for him to see. He said,    Nope,  they don   t want it.       What?       They don   t want it. If they want one, we   ll  go get the one out of the museum.     Made Nancy cry. I said,    I   ll tell you what, that one   s yours now. It  belongs in your family.    Part of that tradition that my family gave her,  she was expressing it through that gift. That was going to be her horse  mask that she gave to the Dog Soldiers to honor her father who   s passed  away. They stepped all over it. Sometimes it happens that way. I don   t  know if they were jealous or she was a different tribe. We went through  our own little ceremony in doing these, starting prayer, putting out  food     Different reasons was,    You don   t know the ceremony.    So what? Who  of these priests know every ceremony back? In naming ceremonies, Sun  Dance isn   t the only place you can do them. You can have your private  24  Little Thunder  Sheridan  Little Thunder  Sheridan  Little Thunder  Sheridan  Little Thunder  ceremonies. They missed out. It   s just like this. We have a lot of  warriors in the military. My son   s a Dog Soldier. I gave this one to him.  No one knows that story. I was there. I saw it. If it wasn   t that way, I  wouldn   t say it, but I know my brother, and I don   t know his reasons  other than,    Nope, they don   t want it.    She was going to feed them, pay  for everything, give them gifts.  So that   s the story behind this. That   s the story of that tradition, passing  on tradition, trying to live a traditional lifestyle, and for whatever reason,  someone   . It was a gift. Hours and hours and hours and expense and  prayer and prayer and prayer. It was like,    Your prayers weren   t good  enough.    Maybe that person   I love him, he   s my brother, but maybe he  just knows something I don   t know. I can   t say. Who am I to say? But  that   s the story behind this, and I wouldn   t say it if it wasn   t that way.  I   ve got a lot of respect for him. Just like Gordon. Day before Mom  came home, Helen went over to his house. He come up, and he doctored  mom with red material. She came home the next day. She   s home right  now. That   s the story of Frank Pipe Woman Sheridan. I also do  women   s saddles, Cheyenne saddles. I   ve beaded one before.  You got a picture in there?  It   s not a very good picture, but there it is, one that I beaded before. You  might have to zoom in on it.  Oh, I see it, yes.  The buckskin shirt next to it, that   s the reproduction of my grandfather   s  shirt in the bedroom in there. I sold that one for five thousand dollars to  a collector out of Colorado. I   m at the point now to where I   m not  selling any more of my better works. I   m keeping them for heirlooms.  I   ve won, I   ve placed, I don   t need to do that anymore. I will eventually.  I   m glad they are going to your family. All right, thank you so much for  your time today, Frank.  I didn   t mean to talk that long. (Laughter) Almost a couple hours. Didn   t  mean to use up all your tape   No. (Laughs)  -------  -------
