 Finchum  James  Today is April 30, 2009. My name is Tanya Finchum and I   m with the  Oklahoma State University Library. This is a project called Oklahoma  Centennial Farm Families and we   re today in Carney, Oklahoma talking with  James and Joann Pickett. So thank you for having us today and let   s start  with having you tell how your family came to own this land.  They came from northern Kansas. My great-grandfather had a farm up there  and this was new country. He advised three of his sons to come to Oklahoma  to get this new, free land. Two of them made the run.One of them settled  down by Meeker and the other one settled over north of Stroud. My  grandfather came here two years after the run and bought this stake from a  man by name of Forsythe and then he claimed the stake to get the land grant.  And then how long did he have to live on this to actually claim it?  Five years.  I think it was five years.  And have so many fences.  They had to have fences, a dwelling, a root cellar, and I guess means to make  a living off of the land.  And how much was the original acreage?  160 acres.  And do you still have that today?  Yes, it   s still in the family. Our middle daughter owns five acres in the  opposite corner of where we   re at. But it   s still in the family.  5  Finchum  James  Finchum  James  Joann  James  Finchum  James  Finchum  James  Finchum  James  Finchum  Can you tell a little bit about the early days then?  Well, Grandfather and his family, when they came from Kansas they rode a  train to Guthrie. He had a team and wagon and they hired some freight  wagons to bring them to the farm, help move them to the farm. And from  what they tell me it was a muddy, cold, rainy day. I think they took all day to  get here or maybe more than one day, I don   t remember. And when the  freight wagons got here they unloaded the stuff that they carried in the yard  and left. I just remember my aunt talking about how cold and nasty and  everything it was.  How did they make their living early on then?  Farming. And I think   didn   t Granddad teach school?  He was a school teacher.  He was a school teacher before he came down here and I think he taught  school here too, plus farmed. I don   t know of any other income that they  would have had.  Did they raise cattle or crops?  They had some cattle and quite a bit of this farm was farmed and I   m  assuming they grew cotton because they said that the first few years they had  to haul the cotton to Guthrie because there were no gins in Carney. And they  grew big gardens, canned lots of food and there was a five-acre orchard here,  kind of right here where we   re sitting. They put up a lot of fruit and squeezed  a lot of apples for apple juice.  Did they plant the fruit trees or were some of them already here?  I think they planted them. I   m sure he planted them because I don   t think this  Forsythe that owned the property before had done much with it.  Was it just apples or was it other     No, there were apples and peaches and pears and oh, every kind of fruit. And  they had a little grape vineyard down here on the corner of the place, too. I  can remember, I destroyed the grapes after I got here. (Laughter) But  Grandmother was probably pretty much self-sufficient. She probably grew  everything except maybe sugar and salt and coffee, they didn   t have much  else, I don   t think.  And did they have tractors or horses at that time? I guess tractors came later.  6  James  Finchum  James  Finchum  James  Finchum  James  Finchum  James  Finchum  James  Joann  James  Finchum  James  Horses, yes. My grandfather never owned a tractor. But he passed away in  1943. I was eight years old and the only thing I can remember about him is  when he was sick and when he died, that   s about the only thing.  And talk a little bit about his house then.  Oh, it was nine rooms, a two-story, nine-room house; pretty nice for those  days. It had the oh, about a one to six wood work on around the doors and the  baseboards and had the circle rosettes at the top at the corners and had a long  stairway that went upstairs with a wooden banister on it. A pretty nice house  for those days.  And how many children did they raise in that house?  They raised five: four girls and a boy. My dad was the last child. He was born  in 1899.  Did you get to spend some time in that house yourself?  Oh, yes.  Had a favorite room?  No, just     Not the kitchen, huh?  Well, not really. My aunt had raised two of my cousins and their mother and  dad, one of them died   well they both died in        19, the flu epidemic.  In that flu epidemic in the early    20s and this oldest aunt of mine never was  married so she raised those two boys. And they had a lot of old, old, old-time  wooden and cast-iron toys and they had an old organ that us kids used to like  to mess with, an old peddle-type organ. And oh, let   s see     Do you know how they came to have that?  They had a lot of nice old antique furniture. And they had one of these old  square Victrolas that stood up so high. We had it restored a couple of years  ago and our grandson now has it in his house. We had the new mechanism put  in it that you crank up and had a lot of old, old, old records. But I was just a  kid and that   s been many years ago. (Laughter)  7  Finchum  James  Finchum  James  Joann  James  Finchum  James  Finchum  James  Finchum  James  What were holidays like back then?  Oh, everybody gathered, you know at Christmas, just like they do now. We  went to the grandparents and family get-togethers and birthdays and things  like that. There were several in Grandfather   s family, but when they left  northern Kansas they kind of lost track of all these brothers. And we knew  there was Picketts out there somewhere but until about ten, eleven years ago  we didn   t know where they   d all went to. We knew where they lived up there  and had seen that property where my great-grandfather lived, but we just  completely lost track of all the other family. And about ten, eleven years ago,  a lady sent us a little writing, and it was some of the same information we had  from a place in Kansas. We went to a family reunion up there and found out  we   ve got a lot of relation around over the country.  That   s neat. Besides the one in Meeker and     Well, see the one in Meeker, they just stayed here a few years and they went  to Cody, Wyoming, I think. And the one north of Stroud, I don   t know where  they went. But that was at the time they got scattered. But the one that was at  Meeker     Was his name Albert?  Albert. His granddaughter lives in Fort Collins, Colorado. She   s found us or  we found her. And her dad lived at Cody, Wyoming.  A long way from Oklahoma.  A long way from Oklahoma.  And what do you think made your particular great-grandparent stay?  Well, I guess he just got attached to the living here and apparently done pretty  well. You know, at least he made a living. And I don   t think he was much of a  mover around, you know. At one time they did own some land over around  Pryor and I don   t know the story on that.  Besides the farmhouse, what other buildings did he have on the place?  He had a barn out there that was built out of oak lumber and it housed 12  cows on the side, so they milked. Then at the end of that barn, sometime later  they built a wooden stave silo. And then after they built that silo   it wound  up inside another barn, attached to that one. And sometime in probably the  early    50s, a little wind storm come along and destroyed those two barns. But  I don   t remember the silo. The foundation of it out there is still there, but the  silo was gone since I can remember. And then in 1904 he built this other barn  and then east of the house they had a little car building and it had granaries on  8  Finchum  James  Finchum  James  Finchum  James  Finchum  James  Finchum  James  Joann  James  Finchum  James  each side of it and then he had a little shop on the end of it like, oh kind of  like a blacksmith shop with a workbench and old coal forges that they heated  the metal to repair their equipment with. And the one barn out here, it was  built in 1940, it had granaries in it and also on the south end of it horse stalls  and hay storage up above.  And it   s not standing today, right?  Not standing today.  Did you reuse any of the materials from it?  At that time we dairied and I used the material from it to build kind of a calf  building, and it   s still standing.  And so you were born not too far from here?  One half a mile, south.  And is that place still standing?  It   s   no. House is gone. My grandfather bought the north 80 of that 160 in  1901 and then this south 80 where the house and the improvements were in  1906. And now it   s been in the family 100 years. I was born there and then  grew up there. Dad milked cows. When I got big enough to milk, I milked  before I went to school and milked after I got home.  Had to get up pretty early then?  Oh yes. And caught the bus early.  The lower picture is where he was born and raised.  And then in 1957, we bought the original home place off of my aunt and then  she held a life estate and a place to live and she lived in the old house. And  just kind of went on from there.  Well you had told us earlier a little bit what happened to the old parts of the  house when they dismantled it. Do you want to tell us a little bit on tape?  We gave the house away and they dismantled it. There was an old water  cistern underneath the house and the guy built a trough or a slide and all the  plaster off the house went into this cistern until it got full. And then he tore  the part of the house down that was usable and took it somewhere and built a  house and then the old oak part that they couldn   t use, a man from north of  Carney come down and took what he wanted out of it and we burnt the rest of  9  Finchum  James  Finchum  Joann  James  Finchum  James  Finchum  James  Finchum  James  it. And there   s still   my grandmother had a lot of flowers and a lot of garden  stuff, there   s still concrete flowerbeds over there; we never did take them up.  Oh there was a frame around the outside of it that was concrete, then there  was flowerbeds in here with this 4-inch wide concrete down in the ground  that partitioned the flowerbeds off and a walkway in between them.  What kind of flowers did she have?  Oh, she   ll have to answer that, I don   t know anything about flowers.  My guess is irises would be in there somewhere.  Mm-hmm.  And in the front yard of the old house, there were four huge cedar trees. I  assume they were planted early, I don   t know. But then they began to die in  later years and I destroyed them. The yard fence across the north side was a  cedar hedge and back in the early days they kept it trimmed and real neat and  then later on it grew up and the grandson didn   t like it so he destroyed them  too.  Well earlier you had said part of the old house was made into a chicken  house?  Yes, the kitchen off the original house, when they built onto it the last time,  they moved the kitchen out and used it for a chicken house. And it was a  single-walled, had 2 X 4 around the top, 2 X 4 around the middle, and one  around the bottom, and then it was sided with 1 X 12   s and the cracks  stripped with a 1 X 2. And that was about it, there wasn   t much insulation  there.  One of the other earlier pieces that   s still here is the windmill.  Yes, the windmill. It had to be here before 1904 because it   s in pictures that  we got that we know are in 1904. East of the house there was what they called  a duck house and my aunt always kept chickens in it, but apparently at one  time they must have had some ducks because they always called that the duck  house. It was nothing but a chicken house to me. Then there was a little  building on east of there that was kind of a hog shed, little old, old, real old  building.  Did you have a smokehouse?  Had  what  they called back in those days the root cellar. There was a  building over it and it   s still there; that probably could   ve been used for the  smokehouse, but I don   t know. But probably in the late    20s or early    30s they  10  Finchum  James  Joann  James  Finchum  James  Finchum  James  Finchum  James  Finchum  James  Finchum  James  Finchum  James  Joann  had what they called a Delco system for electricity. It was a 32-volt electrical  system and they had electric in the house and 32-volt irons and there was a  mixer and stuff you would have nowadays but it run off 32 volts. They would  start this little one-cylinder gasoline engine and tie a generator on the back of  it and it would charge these, oh best I remember they were probably 8 X 10  and probably 12 or 14 inch tall batteries. They had a glass case and it charged  these batteries and then they could shut the engine off and they   d have  electricity till the batteries got low.  How did they heat then using it?  Wood.  And cooked.  And cooked with wood back in the early days.  What about for ice or refrigeration?  Ice box. Just an old time ice box and I assume they delivered ice here. Now  back in the really early days they had an ice house at one time and they cut ice  out of the creeks or out of the water tanks and they put it in this ice house and  they had ice until it melted.  On the property?  On the property.  When you were young then you helped with the dairy.  Oh, yes.  And what would you do for fun?  Oh, went to school (Laughs)     Were you allowed free reign on the property to go wherever you wanted to  go?  Oh yes, oh yes.  And you never got lost?  Oh, no.  He doesn   t like water so he never went to the creek.  11  James  Joann  James  Finchum  James  Joann  James  Finchum  James  Finchum  James  Finchum  James  Finchum  James  Well, I   d go to the creek and play in the creek.  I know, but not     If it got up over my knees it was too deep. (Laughter) And sure enough if it  went over my waist it was too deep.  Do you have brothers and sisters?  I   ve got two sisters and a brother. The young sister, I remember her pretty  much at home but the older sister I can barely remember when she was at  home and my brother, I don   t remember him being home. See he was born in     20 and then Lou was born two years later. And then Donelle was two years  later and then she   s eight years older than I am. And there was a set of twins  born stillborn between I and my younger sister. When was Mary Anne born?  After Lester I think.  And had a sister stillborn after my older brother.  All born at home, I   m assuming?  Yes. They were all born at home.  How close was the school then to your home?  My brothers and sisters all went to a little Lone Star school, it was just a half  mile south of here. But I went to Carney school all the time and that was four  miles from here.  Were you involved in 4-H that early on?  Oh, we didn   t have anything like 4-H. I played basketball. I don   t ever  remember playing much baseball. I remember the folks saying back in the  real early days that the neighbors in the summertime gathered here and they  had a little field on the back side of the place and they   d gather here on I  suppose Sunday afternoon and play ball, neighbors and people in the  community.  That would be nice. So on Sunday afternoons it was mostly like that?  Oh on Sunday afternoon, when I was growing up, just whatever a kid does on  Sunday afternoon ,you know. Back then there wasn   t any TV or anything, so  I   m sure we probably visited some with neighbors and I don   t remember  going much of anywhere.  12  Finchum  James  Finchum  James  Finchum  James  Finchum  James  Finchum  James  Joann  Finchum  Joann  Finchum  James  Joann  James  Finchum  James  Do you remember any home remedies?  Oh mostly just Vick   s, and castor oil.  What was castor oil used for?  Well if you got bound up, it   d sure take care of that. (Laughter)  Just checking.  It   d clean you up.  What about for bee stings and things like that? Did they do anything in  particular for those?  Oh all I remember is just hurt and go on. (Laughs)  Well you   re lucky. In my day it was tobacco juice. My dad would slap on  tobacco juice.  See, none of the family that I ever remember used any tobacco. And I   m sure  my aunt had some home remedies for things but I don   t remember. But all I  remember is if you got stung, it just hurt like crazy and you got over it after  awhile.  My mother used sand on it.  And that worked? Or seemed to?  Mm-hmm.  Did they do any quilting?  Oh yes, my aunt and my grandmother did quite a lot of it. And Mother used to  crochet a lot and     And they   d have quilting at the church.  And they had quilting at the churches. And I guess Grandmother and Aunt  Flora did a lot of crocheting too, didn   t they? And of course Mother made the  girls    clothes when I was growing up.  And where would she have gotten her fabric? From the nearest town?  Probably.  13  Joann  Finchum  James  Finchum  James  Finchum  James  Finchum  James  Finchum  James  Finchum  Joann  James  Finchum  James  Feed sacks.  Feed sacks.  A lot of it was feed sacks because I can remember when Dad would go to buy  chicken feed, he   d always ask Mother,    Well what print?    Or she   d go along  and she got the kind of printed sack that she wanted, even if it was at the  bottom of the stack. And I   m sure that most of their clothes were made out of  it. And then I   m sure she bought fabric at the stores, you know.  And where would they go to shop to do things like that?  Carney.  Carney. It was bigger than it is now?  Well, yes. Did you go through the main part of town?  I don   t know if we did or not.  You just come down the highway?  Yes.  That   s not Carney.  Okay, we   ll go through town on the way back.  There   s nothing up there.  There   s nothing up there, it   s about all fell down. But there was a grocery  store there and a feed store and the feed store bought cream and eggs and I  assume the grocery store even bought eggs. But at one time there were three  cotton gins at Carney. And the railroad went through there. And stopped the  train there, used to be a depot there, a big old depot house that I suppose the  depot agent lived in.  So would they just take their dairy products as far as there?  Now the milk, in the real early days I don   t know how they handled it, but  later on they gathered the milk every morning and hauled it to Highway 66 in  an old pickup and a truck picked it up. And then later years, the milk was put  in 10-gallon cans, which it was back then too, but it was put in 10-gallon cans  and they pumped water into a concrete vat to cool the milk, and the milk truck  run once a day and picked it up. Then in later years they had a little, it was a  14  Finchum  James  Finchum  James  Finchum  Joann  Finchum  James  Joann  James  Joann  James  Joann  James  water tank with a little cooling unit on it and it cooled the milk down to  whatever, before it would freeze and the milk truck picked it up every day.  And watermelons were sure good, you   d take a watermelon and dump it in  that old milk cooler tank and they   d get real cold, then you   d cut it.  Sounds good.  We   ve been through the dairy from milking by hand and separating cream off  of it or putting it in 10-gallon cans, to bucket type milkers that you hung on a  cow   s back and put on a cow and then poured the milk into the cans, to a  pipeline milker, went into a stainless steel bowl tank, and even up to where  we had automatic take-offs that took the milkers off the cows when they got  through. We   ve been through the whole thing.  Do you still have dairy cows?  No. We quit ten years ago. Sold the dairy cows ten years ago and went to  beef.  So do you miss having fresh milk?  No.  Or ice cream or butter or whatever?  My grandparents, they made cottage cheese and, of course, churned our own  butter     And buttermilk.     and buttermilk. Now Mother, I can remember her churning butter and  making cottage cheese. But my aunt was famous for the cottage cheese, she  had one old cow. The old cow, she never did get her bred back and milked her  for so many years and finally the old milk got to where you couldn   t hardly  eat the cottage cheese, it got rank. (Laughter) I remember she   d bring that  cottage cheese over to the house because she lived across the  way  and I  think she fed it to the chickens. (Laughs) It was rank. But bless her heart,  she   d done that all her life.  And she sold eggs.  We have a book of her records she kept.  In 1943.  From 1943, we have them. She   s been a week or so digging this stuff up.  15  Joann  Finchum  James  Finchum  James  Finchum  James  Finchum  James  Finchum  James  Finchum  James  Finchum  James  Finchum  (Laughter)  But this is what some of the prices and things that she   d     You can actually read the writing, too. And she did this?  No, that was my aunt.  It wasn   t an uncle.  No, that was my aunt. She was the one that never did marry.  In good shape, too. 1944. So she would   ve been here through the Depression  years then.  Oh, yes. They never did talk much about the Depression outside of things  were rough, you know. But they never did really say much about the  hardships or what they really went through. But apparently they made it  through the Depression without any help from anyone.  Living on a farm, having your own food helped with a good chunk of that I   d  say.  Oh, yes. And I think Granddad Lewis, him and nine other men started the  town of Carney. They basically put up whatever they did back then to  establish the town of Carney.  Had a post office early on then?  They have one yet. Carney still has a post office. My dad   s first tractor was a  1939 and we   ve had them ever since.  Well, 1939 was during the Depression years too. So I wonder how he  managed to pay for one. Any idea?  Don   t know.  Sold a lot of dairy or picked a lot of cotton, huh?  Dad grew cotton, but he had a colored guy that chopped the cotton, picked the  cotton. Dad planted it and cultivated it, the colored man chopped it, the  colored man picked it. Dad hauled it to the gin. And some kind of a share  crop, I have no idea. But that   s how he got the cotton picked.  You didn   t have to pick any yourself?  16  James  Finchum  James  Nykolaiszyn  James  Finchum  James  Joann  James  Finchum  James  Finchum  Joann  James  No. I remember one time as a kid   I liked this old colored guy real well, he  was real nice, and he brought an extra cotton sack and I went down there and  picked a little bit. I was just a spoiled kid, that wasn   t for me. I   d rather do  other things  (Laughs)  Rather go back and milk the cow?  Yes, cotton would make your fingers sore.  Do you remember the first time you drove a tractor?  Oh, no, not really. Probably in the middle to late    40s. I can   t hardly  remember when I didn   t, because after Dad got rid of that first old tractor in     43 or    44   when was the war over with?     44,    45.     44. He got the first International tractor that came into Chandler, new. He   d  had this first old Farmall tractor and then he got this new one after the war,  after he had his name on the list for it for awhile. It didn   t work out too good.  A man offered him some profit, so he sold it to him and he went and bought a  used Moline tractor   that was in the late    30s. We used that for several years  and then he bought another new one like the one   it was an H Farmall   he  bought another new one like that and it was all right. But oh, I don   t know  how old I was, probably 13, 14 years old maybe. Let   s see, Dad bought that  Farmall C in    49, so I   d have been about 14 years old, I guess. I took that  tractor and Dad did a lot of custom hay and I could hay all over this country  on my own. I took that tractor and went from  one  farm to another and cut  hay for people.  They always fixed a large lunch for them.  Yes, we cut mostly native grass, prairie grass, and you   d go put these people   s  hay up and the women always fixed big meals. Fried chicken, all the iced tea  you could drink, mashed potatoes and corn and gravy, always pie and you  were Sunday fed, you know. And that was all I remember that about it.  Would that be your payment or would you actually get paid a little?  Dad collected for it.  You did the work, he got the money?  He always had money though in his pocket.  Dad was pretty generous. When I was, probably, a freshman in high school or  17  Joann  James  Finchum  James  Joann  Finchum  Nykolaiszyn  Joann  James  Joann  Nykolaiszyn  Joann  something one of the guys  who  worked in a bank had a little dairy up here  south of Carney and in the winter time he fed his cows in a barn. On Friday  afternoon and Saturday I   d haul the manure and hay and stuff out of the barn  and spread it for him. I made 60-65 cents an hour and was glad to get it. Some  of the kids didn   t have any money in their pocket and I always had, I did not  have much but I had money in my pocket. I can remember when Coke was a  nickel and 15, 20 cents for a hamburger or a grilled cheese sandwich.  Tell them about the raise that you wanted. (Laughs)  Oh, I asked this banker one day if he couldn   t give me a raise and he said,    If  you don   t want to do it for that 65 cents an hour, I   ve got a man with a family  that will take your job.    I said,    Well, forget that,    I didn   t want a raise near  as bad as I thought I did. (Laughter) It was a lot of work, but you know I was  used to that because I had to do it at home.  So where was the closest picture show then, if you had a little bit of money?  Carney. Carney had a picture show and it was on Saturday night. They  showed it on the side of the gymnasium and sometimes they had a tent up  there and if they didn   t, you   d just sit out there in chairs on the ground. Or  you could drive a vehicle down there and sit in it. I don   t know how long, that  was before you  Joann  came here even in the late    40s.  Yes, but that   s where we met, at the picture show.  Well, might as well ask your question then, Julie.  Well, that question always gets me in trouble. How did you meet your wife?  At the picture show. (Laughter)  I   ll let her tell that.  I came here with my parents in    49 and we bought a farm from his uncle, so  he was just around. But we went to the picture show, or a girlfriend and I did,  and we walked up to a little drugstore and it started to rain. He was standing  there and we were talking about setting out and getting rained on. He said,     Well, the pickup   s parked down there, just go down and get in it,    so we did.  So he came and got in and the girl got out and I stayed in there and that   s  where it all got started.  Why did your family move to this part of Oklahoma?  My dad liked the cemetery. (Laughs) That was the calling card, the cemetery   He thought that was the prettiest cemetery he had ever seen and he said that   s  18  Finchum  Joann  James  Finchum  James  Finchum  Joann  James  Finchum  James  Joann  James  Finchum  James  Finchum  where he wanted to be buried, so he bought the farm. (Laughter)  Is it still the prettiest one around?  Yes. You probably passed it just north of Carney.  Just north of Carney. Did you come from the south or the north?  We came down 177 and turned on 870.  From Stillwater, yes. You came right by the Carney cemetery.  Well we   ll pay attention going back. I noticed it says in here that Louis  Pickett had something to do with the cemetery.  He   s on that cemetery board. (Laughs) His dad was and then he took his dad   s  place.  Granddad, I don   t know, I guess he was on the cemetery board and Dad was  on the cemetery board and then when he died, I inherited it. So I don   t really  do anything up there but I do go to the meetings some to pass my opinion, for  whatever that is.  And are your family members there?  Yes. Let   s see, my grandparents are there and the stillborn brothers and sisters  are there and my parents are there. And now my brother and sister are both  buried west of Oklahoma City with their spouses. We had one four-space lot  up there and a few years ago it was getting crowded up in that part where our  spaces were and they didn   t join in any of our family and so we increased the  cemetery by four acres and so I told her I was going to sell those four spaces  and I was going to buy 16 spaces. She told me I didn   t need 16 spaces.  I said,    What are we going to do with 16 spaces?    So he got 12.  We have 12 spaces up there and any of the family that wants to use them,  that   s what they   re there for.  Is it attached to a church?  No. The only thing there is up there is two bathrooms and a little tool house.  And then what do you call that deal up there where they have their little  speeches if they have any? Kind of a podium thing. And then we put some  stone up there that has all the veterans that are buried, their names.  From Carney?  19  James  Finchum  James  Nykolaiszyn  Joann  Nykolaiszyn  Joann  James  Joann  Finchum  James  Finchum  James  You know, that were buried there. Anyone that was in the service that   s  deceased and buried there, has their name on it.  That   s nice.  And we still see that it gets taken care of. They used to send out dues,  everybody that had a lot there got billed for dues to keep up the cemetery.  Well, it got to where it didn   t work so now when they sell a lot they collect  what they call perpetual care and it   s put into a certificate of deposit and  that   s what we pay the bills on and low-interest, it   s pretty thin sometimes.  And then the original cemetery, royalty came with it and they drilled a well  right next to it so the last few years we   ve had a little oil income for the  cemetery and that   s helped tremendously. But now oil and gas is cheap and  production goes down so we   re back to kind of square one, you know.  Well, you told us a little bit about how you met. Tell us how long you   ve been  married and a little bit about your kids, your grandkids.  We   ve been married 56 years. We have three daughters, eight grandchildren  and twelve great-grands.  And do any of them visit the farm regularly and help out?  Grandsons.  We   ve got two grandsons. Dustin that just left here, he roughnecks one week  and he works here part of the next week, the week he   s off. He works seven  12-hour days for an oil company.  Janet  daughter  was our helper in the dairy. She would come down several  times a week and milk at night. We would get to take vacations and she  would milk. Our oldest grandson would help feed and they did chores so we  could go.  So if I   ve counted right, there   s five generations then? Your grandfather, your  father, you, your children, and then your grandson.  Yes.  That   s pretty impressive.  The grandson that helps us now roughnecks seven days and then the seven  days he   s off. He works here basically four and a half, five days. And then  one of the older grandsons, he worked for us through high school and through  college     20  Joann  James  Joann  James  Finchum  James  Joann  James  Finchum  James  Joann  James  OSU.  Then he got a real job and he comes on weekends around here some when he  doesn   t have things to do. And our youngest daughter, Janet, she for years  milked at night several nights a week until she went to having grandkids and  had to babysit.  Well, she would bring Macey with her.  But then when we sold the cows, she just comes down and helps once in  awhile when we need her.  So what does the farm do now currently?  We run beef cattle and grow some wheat and some alfalfa and some barley  for grain and basically we feed what we grow. We still have the little  stationary mill that we fed the dairy cows with so we grow barley and then I   ll  buy whatever else we need in feed and make our own feed. We put up our  own hay basically, as long as we can find enough to put up. If we don   t, we  buy some hay.  He worked for Lincoln County for 15 years and then we dairied and he  farmed. Then in    69 he quit and we added a few cows to the line so he   s never  worked off the farm.  Since then.  About how many cows are we talking about? Just roughly?  175 head of mother cows   well there   s a few more than that now, but about  175 head of mother cows. Then we own some other land and we plant quite a  little bit of wheat for hay. We pasture this wheat in the wintertime either the  cows or we keep some of the calves over and run them on wheat in the  wintertime and then sell them after the first year.  But the dairy cows though, we milked almost 100.  We milked about a maximum of 100, up to 100. And then all the feed we  could raise with the land we had and bought quite a little bit of grain and hay  out of down around Jones, Oklahoma and when they didn   t feed, the hay  came in from western Kansas that we didn   t grow. We raised all of our heifers  and artificially bred all the cows, I did that. We raise the steer calves basically  up to about 500 to 700 pounds and then sell them. And we   ve had a few beef  cattle all along.  21  Finchum  James  Finchum  James  Joann  James  Finchum  James  Finchum  James  Finchum  James  And how do they get to market now?  In a stock trailer we haul. We haul them to Oklahoma City. Basically the  cattle go to Oklahoma City and go through the National Stockyards. We   ve  had a time or two a local person here grouped cattle and sent them to a feed  lot and we   ve sold some to him. Once in awhile we   ll sell a few to a local sale  barn but not very many. Basically everything goes to the City. And the  grandsons help me work the cows, vaccinate them and worm them.  So a typical day now is what?  I usually leave the house even now at 7:30 in the morning. I come back and  eat lunch then depending on what   s going on after that, but in the summertime  sometimes after dark.  When we were dairying though, our alarm went off at 3:30.  Seven days a week.  And how early would you get to go to bed if you get up that early?  Oh, nine or ten    o clock. But back a few years there we had some high school  kids that come down and milked some at night. They were aggravating. The  last one quit and Janet asked me what I was going to do and I said,    We   ll just  milk and do it.    And she said,    Well, I   ll come down.    And they always come  home on Sunday night. Janet and her husband and our middle daughter are  here almost every Sunday night. She said,    Well, I   ll just come milk.    And I  said,    Well, okay.    And I thought, I can remember when you were at home.  (Laughter) Well she helped when she was home. She fed calves and did some  things. But I thought okay. So one night, Sunday night she came and she  brought her clothes to go to the barn. I went down there with her and spent  about 30 or 40 minutes and I just walked out. And she took over. When she  milked I came in from the field and fed the cows and normally fed the calves  and then I   d take her place and give her a few minutes break where she   d  come to the house or something and then she   d finish up. And several years  there she milked four or five nights a week.  Are we talking about hand-milking?  No. That was after we had the pipeline and it was fully automatic.  It would still take awhile though.  Yes, when we were milking up close to 100, it   d take three and a half, four  hours twice a day best I remember, but it went straight from the cow to the  tank.  22  Joann  James  Joann  James  Finchum  Joann  James  Nykolaiszyn  James  Finchum  James  Finchum  James  Finchum  James  Finchum  They picked it up, some days it was everyday but most usually it was every  other day. And we have all of the production from the first day to the last day,  every pound, the price of the milk, the butter fat, the whole thing.  What it brought. She   s kept that record from the day we started milking here.  Until 1967, we milked on the other farm. And in 1967, we already owned part  of the cows and so we bought Dad   s part and he quit and we moved the cows  over here and built the dairy barn.  Yes, the milk check started in our name the first day of December of    67.  She   s got every day   s production and basically how many cows we milked at  that time.  Almost 30 years worth then.  It was over 30.  She   s got it in a little book. Show it to them if you want to.  That   s a lot of work.  Oh, she   d write notes in there of what the weather was and how hot  sometimes. Not every day but you know, a few days how hot it was or how  cold it was or how many cows we had with mastitis.  Well did you name some of the cows or were they just     The ones I called a name you don   t want to hear. (Laughter)  You didn   t get too attached to them, huh?  Well, yes some of them. I probably didn   t do as good a job culling cows as I  should have.  Come time to do your taxes I guess some of this would help too.  We kept the cows numbered, that   s the way we identified the cows. At the  time we sold them we had about a 65 pound herd average a day. That   s pretty  good, especially for twice a day milking. But we used artificial breeding since  I guess about    72 and we kind of mated the cows to the sire and continually  tried to upgrade the herd. Sometimes it didn   t always work, but you know, we  tried.  You kept track of generations of cows then?  23  James  Joann  Finchum  James  Joann  Nykolaiszyn  Joann  Finchum  James  Joann  Finchum  James  Well, we really didn   t keep anything.  This is our first, in    67 that was our first. The price of milk.  So over 30 years there   s some change in the amount per?  Oh yes. Yes, we started out probably I don   t know, you could go back and see  what our herd average was back then but I   d say 40 pounds and over the years  run it up to 65.  This was the last month that we milked, April of    99.  So how long would it take you to keep the books on a normal day?  I don   t know, I just worked on them. I like to do things like that.  It was a team effort all the time. So you didn   t get too many vacations.  Well, yes we took a vacation about every year. Before when the kids were  younger, my dad would come over and milk and I   d get our neighbor to help  him. We were never gone very long, two or three, four days, you know. And  then after the kids got older, then they would   see Janet and this older  grandson, five or six days and they   d get tired of it you know. But I   d call  home twice a day and Michael, our grandson, just like this one over here, he   s  mechanically minded enough if they were having problems I could tell them  pretty much how to fix it. Of course, Janet took care of the milking and all of  that and Michael was around to do the feeding and he   d help her clean up and  keep feed ground for them and do whatever had to be done. But four, five, six  days and they   d get ready to see us again.  He was ready to come home, too.  Did you have a dog that would herd them?  Oh, we   ve got an old dog down here now, an old border collie dog. She liked  to work the cows. And then the one before her, an old collie dog came here  and you could try to run him off, but he was just an old collie dog. He   d just  hunker down and wouldn   t do anything. He got to be quite a bit of help. I was  getting some hay out of the barn here one day and the cattle kind of ganged  up around the truck and, of course, I was always afraid they were going to  bend it or bump it and a cow stepped on this old dog   s foot and made him  mad. And from then on, he   d keep the cattle away from the truck. He   d go  back in the barn and they didn   t come close to that truck, he   d run them away.  (Laughter) He was a pretty good buddy. But that   s the only two dogs I  remember that was worth anything.  24  Finchum  James  Finchum  James  Joann  James  Finchum  James  Finchum  Joann  James  Joann  Finchum  James  Joann  Finchum  When you think of dairy cows, you think of cats. So did you have?  Oh.  Evidently.  Oh lots. At times there, we had probably 20, 30 cats around here. (Laughter)  There were just cats everywhere, you know. But now we can   t keep any and  the two or three we got, you can   t get within a 100 feet of them.  Well, we   re not supposed to feed cats milk, but we always did.  We always had fresh cow milk that we fed to the calves and of course you  had some to pour out and the cats drank that and you always had some treated  cows and if you didn   t need that milk for the calves it got poured out. Cows  with mastitis, you   d have to treat them with antibiotics and you couldn   t use  the milk so it was just to be destroyed.  How close was the closest vet?  Chandler, about nine miles. And we used to use the vet quite a little bit, but  any more they won   t come out. They won   t come out to you. And the one in  Chandler that we used for so many years, he   s went to small animal and he  don   t even want you to bring them to him. Now there   s one in Perkins that  you can haul cattle to, but they want you to bring them to them. They don   t  want to come out. So you learn to do most of it yourself.  What do you think has been the biggest change in farming, in what you do?  Equipment.  Probably the equipment. We went from tractors with no cabs to small tractors,  put in lots and lots of hours on them, and to bigger tractors, cabs, air  conditioners     Windshield wipers.  Radio?  Radio.  CD player.  Seriously?  25  James  Finchum  James  Finchum  James  Joann  James  Finchum  James  Finchum  James  Seriously. We own one tractor that doesn   t have a cab on it. The combine has  a cab on it, air conditioner in it, what we cut our hay with, cab and air  conditioner. And if the air conditioner goes out, you   re broke down.  (Laughter) Because you cannot believe how hot it is in one of them cabs on a  90 or 100 degree day with that glass and that sun shining in there. It   s  unbearably hot.  And the windows won   t roll down?  Well, they have little windows that open.  But not much.  But they just open about this wide. And if you open the door to get air in  there, it   s a dirt trap. Dirt falls in there and you can   t see, you can   t breathe,  you can   t   it   s miserable. We run a tractor a little while during a day if the air  conditioner goes out, but you don   t run it long. It   s just too hot in there.  I couldn   t understand why he bought a tractor with windshield wipers. I said,     If it   s raining enough to use the windshield wipers, you shouldn   t even be in  the field      Why they put them on there I don   t know, but they do. Well sometimes you  rake that dirt off of it.  For fog in the morning maybe?  Well either that or you wipe the dirt off the windshield with the windshield  wiper.  With the combine do you participate in a ring?  No. Now back in the early days, when they used a thrashing machine, I don   t  know about Granddad but I   m sure he did. Dad didn   t own a thrashing  machine but when they came to thrash the grain, and at that time they used  horses and wagons to pick up the   they had a deal that bound the grain in a  bundle, they picked it up out of the field, hauled it to the thrashing machine.  All the neighbors gathered together and they helped each other because the  thrashing machine just came through the country. I guess you would call it a  thrashing ring and they helped each other. After the straw went through the  thrashing machine, I can remember the great big piles   to me then they were  huge, piles of straw   and Dad would let the cows run to the piles of straw in  the wintertime and they   d bed down around the straw pile and they   d eat little  holes in the straw. And by spring that straw was pretty well gone. I don   t  remember how many helped when they done that. But I can remember when  Dad got his first combine. It was tractor pulled and I was old enough he  26  Finchum  James  Finchum  James  Finchum  James  Finchum  James  Finchum  James  Finchum  James  Finchum  James   would  run the combine and I scooped the grain. We took it to a granary and  scooped it off of a pickup into the granary. And he was always mad or a little  aggravated if I didn   t get it scooped off and get back before he got another bin  full.  Where was the closest granary, Carney?  No, we put it in home storage. And then if he had wheat to sell, then we  hauled it to Wellston in a pickup. Them days we didn   t have a truck, we just  hauled it in the pickup. And you   d take a pickup load of wheat down there  and they   d unload it and you   d come back and get another one. And if he had  to shut down between loads he   d just shut down.  How many loads a day then, roughly?  Oh, I don   t know, probably three or four, five loads a day cause he always  had to milk of a morning and wait till the dew went off and he had to quit  early enough to go milk again that evening. So you know, and then lot of the  time they   d take a load in after they milked, have it on a pickup and take it in  after they milked.  And what was the water source for the farm?  Wells.  Wells. Ponds?  Ponds. Well, back in the early days they didn   t have any ponds. Cattle were  all watered out of the well. But now guess we   ve got ponds in every pasture.  So was there a creek on the property?  Yes, not on this property but on the other, the one down across the road here,  Bell Cow Creek.  We saw that. Interesting name, any idea how they came up with it?  I don   t have any idea. Bell Cow Creek and now there   s a Bell Cow Lake on  that creek down by Chandler. But you know where the other farm is?  We saw it coming in.  Now Michael, the grandson that helped us for a long time, he has a newer  house over here on this lake road, it   s the second house from 177 on the north  side of the road. Pretty nice if you noticed; he lives on the corner of that  place. After Mother died, this house here was over there where the trailer  27  Finchum  James  Joann  James  Finchum  Nykolaiszyn  Joann  James  Finchum  James  house is. You saw the trailer house. It was over there and oh we had people  that wanted to rent it. People wanted to live in it and I wouldn   t ever let them.  Set there for a couple of years. A guy come by one day and offered me some  money for it and I said,    Move it.    And then shortly after that, his mother and  stepdad lived in Carney, and they were going to move to Guthrie and he said,     Granddad, I can   t live in Guthrie and go to school in Stillwater or Edmond  and help too.    And I said,    Well, we   ll buy a trailer house.    The well was still  there and the sewer and all was still there so I said,    We   ll just buy a trailer  house, put it over and you can live in it.    So that   s how come the trailer house  is over there. Now we call it the weaning house.  You want me to ask why?  Well, get them out of their parent   s house. So Michael lived over there until a  couple years after he got married. And then Dustin here     When Michael moved out, he moved in.  Michael moved out, Dustin moved in. Well and then Dusty moved out July of  last year, so it set over empty until Christmas Eve and Janet   s daughter and  son-in-law have got a big wide double trailer over here on another farm we  own and Christmas Eve they had a fire and done some damage and smoked  up the house awful bad. And so they had to have a place to live and they   re  living over there now until they get this one where they can live, move back  in it. So I guess you   d call it the weaning house. (Laughter) Wean them away  from their parents   But not too far from home.  Well what are some of the other structures now on the property that have  been added since the early days?  The shop.  The shop and a machine shed down here and two hay barns and a dairy barn,  two calf sheds, and one barn is tore down and re-built. And grain bins and a  house. We   ve built all of them, or built them or had them built since we   ve  been there.  And you   d get your supplies from?  Just here and there, whoever   s got the best deal. There were two barns built  out of a little lumber yard over at Tryon back several years ago. And I  suppose this machine shed was probably built out off the lumber yard over at  Tryon. This house was a rollaway house; it was built in Shawnee, the basic  part of the house, the first part of it, was built in Shawnee. After our house  28  Joann  James  Joann  James  Joann  Finchum  James  Joann  James  Joann  Finchum  James  Finchum  James  burnt, we needed a place to live right then.  We stayed in the two-story house with his aunt.  We moved it up here and it was sheet rocked and wired and the cabinets were  built and we plumbed it and tape embedded the sheet rock. At that time it had  hard wood floors in it, finished the floors, but it was a complete house and  then moved in it. Since then it   s been built onto three times. We built the  living room where you came in. First we built a ten by ten utility room for the  washer and dryer and stuff. And then later on we built the living area and  changed the kitchen and   well we changed the old living room into a  bedroom and a bathroom. And then we built the kitchen on later, the kitchen  now, and added on another eight foot onto the utility room. And it was built  on in    69?  The kitchen was    79 cause that   s when Cherri had her wreck.     79. And I don   t remember when we built that living room on. But we put this  stone on the house when we built onto it the second time. And then when we  built the kitchen on, then we took the stone off the back of it and I found  enough to match it up. It   s a man-made stone, but they don   t make it  anymore. It was what they called Intstone. I think the company went broke.  Our kitchen was in where the dining room was and after the girls all got  married and left home, it wasn   t large enough for everyone so then we built  on this kitchen in there and so guess where everybody comes   the kitchen.  (Laughs) That   s a good thing. So what do you foresee for the next hundred  years for this property? Five generations, you   ve got to do five more.  It   ll probably get split up in little pieces. Hopefully these two quarters that  have been in the family for a hundred years will stay in the family.  That   s one of the requests.  That   ll be one of the requests. And the other land we own, it   s not so much.  We   ve got 1,088 acres.  Counting these two?  Counting these two quarters.  That   s a lot of property.  We   ve bought and sold a little bit of land over the years, probably should   ve  kept some of it but there was little profit in it so we needed a profit to make  29  Joann  James  Joann  James  Finchum  James  Finchum  James  this thing work. And there   s been some skinny years. But we   d like for this  place and that one over there, and then we own the one, 158 acres to the  quarter right south of this. And it kind of all groups in here. We   ve got a half  section on this side of the road, less the daughter and less the lady that used to  own that place. And then the grandson   s got eight acres off that quarter over  there. But we   d like for them to all stay within the family. And then the rest of  the land is   oh there   s 200 acres over east here and one granddaughter lives  on   she   s got acre and seven tenths off of 140 of that and then Janet   s  daughter   s got two acres on a place west of the highway. And then joining  this we   ve got 85 acres in this section across the road besides the 160 that it  probably kind of needs to stay in the family because that   s something that  Dad had and it matches up with this other two. It all joins either corners or  anyway it joins.  Where your dad had the Garret place, too.  Well and then we   ve got another 155 acres, well we own it all but 20. Got a  niece that owns 20 acres when Mother passed away. Anyway two sisters and  a brother inherited that 155 acres and then brother died and he left his to a  daughter and a son. Well the son had breast cancer and he come one day and  wanted to sell us his 20 acres so we bought it and then we bought both sisters     40 or 30-something acres. And then this one niece that still owns 20 acres   or  her part of the 155 acres. And it would be 160 but the railroad went up one  side of it and they got.  The Old Katy.  The Old Katy railroad went up the side of it.  Is the bed still there?  Yes. A guy got mad at me one night and hung up on me. He had the job of  selling the old right of way back to the farmers that owned the land. I thought  I made him a pretty decent offer on it and he kept after me to give him what  he wanted on it and I wouldn   t do it. I told him,    Well it   d cost more to build  a fence and put it back like it   s supposed to be than the land was worth.    He  got mad and hung up on me. Sold it to a guy that bought it for his son to hunt  on and they don   t do anything with it. It still costs more to build a fence on it  than it   s worth.  Speaking of fences, do you have all of it fenced? The entire thousand acres or  whatever?  All of it. It   s all fenced and most of it is cross-fenced and all the farmland is  fenced off separate where we can pasture it if we need to or if we want to or if  we farm it. Every bit of it   s fenced.  30  Finchum  James  Joann  James  Joann  James  Finchum  Joann  James  Finchum  James  Joann  James  Takes a while to check all of those then?  Oh, after 2007   s ice storm it was a nightmare.  Terrible.  I can   t even tell you what it cost to straighten the fences up after it because we  hired a guy. You got any idea how long David worked? Two or three months  and did nothing but cut limbs off of fences and patch the fence.  And then your dozer work.  And I   ve got, I don   t know   oh way over 400 hours with a dozer and a  tractor and stuff cleaning up these limbs. I burnt 11 or 12 brush piles the day  before yesterday that were still piled up from    07. And on this place south  here there   s one, two, three, four   I think there   s four big piles that are bigger  than this house of just limbs off these trees. And the property   s basically  cleared. We cleaned this place up over here where I was born, I guess part of  it now four times. Every time the wind blows, we get more limbs on the  ground. They hang in those trees and they blow out   I got so sick of hauling  brush.  You want to cut the trees down?  The pecan trees are the ones that had the most damage.  If it wasn   t for having some shade and I had a little bigger bull dozer I   d  knock them all down. And the longer I go and the more I think about it too,  there   s trees down there that you can   t     Probably as old as the farm.  Oh, they   re huge.  We had one good pecan crop. Two years before the ice storm.  We had a fair pecan crop before the ice storm and a guy was going to pick  them up commercially   he   s got all this equipment. They come out and shake  the trees and then pick them up mechanically and they haul them somewhere  and sort them and then later on down the road they bring you a check for half  of them. He was going to be there the next week and he came up the next  week after the ice storm and he said,    What can we do?    and I said,    There  ain   t nothing you can do. By the time I get the limbs cleaned up, there won   t  be any pecans.    We had a guy that cut a few limbs for wood and he said we  probably had over 500 ricks of pecan wood on the ground. The boys had  31  Finchum  James  Finchum  James  Finchum  James  Joann  Finchum  James  carried me around in that one tractor with a front-end loader on it and taken a  chainsaw and the ones that you could reach that are broke, cut them off. And  some of them I pulled out of the trees with just a dozer, chain up on top,  pulled them out of the trees. Some of the limbs were that big around. And it   s  a mess, it   s just a mess.  But I can   t spray the pastures and can   t fertilize them with the limbs laying  there, you   ve got to clean them up. This winter I started on a place way over  west and it doesn   t have many pecan trees on it but it was oaks and black  jacks and some of those   there   s places in there that you can   t walk through  the dead limbs to look for a cow. They   re just so thick that you can   t. I put a  100 hours in over there and cleaning up some of that and I just moved out the  other day. I get back over here and burn these brush piles. And I   d like to get  them burnt before I have to go doing other things.  Or before they have the no-burn ban.  See it hasn   t been fit all winter to burn, just too windy and too much dry grass  and finally this Tuesday I set these afire. There   s enough green grass out there  now that you know   and then when I burn them I keep the dozer there.  Just in case?  Well in case and then I round them up and I dig a hole and bury what   s left.  When the fire goes out I   ll dig a hole and bury what   s left. Cleans up nice  until the wind blows again. (Laughter) We had two guys pick up some limbs  down there at the trailer house the other day   what was that, the week before  last? And I noticed three limbs on the ground down there again. Just from the  week before last.  It seems to be getting worse, the wind does.  Oh, yeah. I don   t ever remember the wind blowing like it   s blowed the last  year. It   s awful. But it   s going to be awful hard for young people to take one  of these farms and do anything with them outside of just work somewhere and  do it in their spare time because land   s gotten so high and the profit margin is  so small and they can work off a farm and make so much more money than  they can ever think about making on this farm nowadays. It doesn   t look good  for agriculture for me. I mean, for the future in agriculture. I think they   ll just  have to part-time it and do whatever they can do.  He just had a new tractor delivered today.  A new toy?  Yes, I guess. I done it and now I still got mixed emotions about it. (Laughter)  32  Nykolaiszyn  James  Joann  James  Joann  James  Joann  James  Finchum  James  Did your father ever pass down some advice in terms of working in dairy or  farming or working the land?  Not a lot because I worked with him for so long and up until 1967 we farmed  together and milked together. He never did say much about outside of,     Whatever money you borrow and whatever you buy, you need to be able to  pay for it in a year.     And that   s what we do.  Don   t borrow more than you think you can pay for in a year. And there   s a  few times we didn   t follow his advice too good because a few times we owed  a whole lot of money and there wasn   t no way you could make that back in a  year.  But at first though.  But at first we pretty much stayed with that until we got where we felt like we  were safe enough to stick our neck out. (Laughs) But sometimes we   ve stuck  it way out there.  We bought a used vehicle and he sent me to the bank to borrow the money.  George Jonas said,    How long do you want to make the payments for?    And I  said,    Well, he said a year.    He said,    Do you know how much that payment  is going to be?    And I said,    Well that   s what he said.    He said,    If that   s  what Sonny said, that   s what Sonny meant.    And so we set it up for a year  and had it paid for before a year.  At that time I was working for the county and my salary was  213 a month  take home. Payment on that car   s  183 a month. I didn   t really figure it up  before I told her to do that. (Laughter) Something I don   t normally do, but I  didn   t really figure it up. She come home and said,    Do you know what the  payments are on that car?    It was a 1964 Dodge and we bought it, it had  10,000 miles on it. Pretty nice car for them days and I said,    Well, we   ll make  it.    And of course we had a milk check. At that time out here in this garage, at  night and when I didn   t have farming to do after the milking was done, I built  gates and corner posts and trailers and done a lot of welding out there. And it  worked, paid for it in a year. I don   t even remember whether sometimes I had  doubts that I was going to make it or not, I don   t remember. Just something  you do.  Do the math a little bit different next time.  Yes or think about it a little bit more. I don   t know. Most everything that  we   ve done   maybe not spent enough time thinking about it, but we kind of  had an idea where we were going. The tax man tells me that we ought to   the  33  Joann  James  Joann  James  Joann  James  Joann  James  Finchum  James  Joann  James  Joann  James  Joann  last few years the farm hasn   t made any money but I haven   t wanted it to. So I  guess     We   re no longer considered farmers though even though he spends all day  long on the farm, we   re not considered farmers.  Our other income   s higher than farm income. But I guess I   ve got this idea, I  don   t guess we   ve ever talked about it but anyway, I   ve got this idea that I  had my day and now I   m going to have some of these things I   ve wanted.  Like a new tractor.  We take a lot of trips.  My grandmother was born in Switzerland and she came over here when she  was seven years old, I think. Anyway, the house   this maybe doesn   t pertain  to anything but     Well your grandmother that came here is the one that was     Anyway the house she was born in and raised in her lifetime over there is still  standing. And the church is still standing. So I told her I wanted her and the  kids to go to Switzerland and so they got one of these tours and they went to  Germany, Switzerland, and Austria three years ago or four years ago.  Five.  Five years ago. So they went and saw it.  And you wouldn   t go?  Oh no, I don   t care about going nowhere.  We still have family that lives over there,  his grandmother   s  father   s  daughter.  She   s probably in her 80s and she has three sons and they still live in  Switzerland.  We visited with them two different afternoons and they took us to see the  castle. But he said it was too far, if anything happened on the farm he couldn   t  get back.  So I guess they enjoyed it.  Yes, we did.  34  Finchum  James  Finchum  James  Joann  James  Joann  Finchum  James  Joann  James  Joann  James  Joann  James  Joann  James  Joann  James  Joann  It   s your turn to go then if you   re not farming so much.  I don   t want to go.  Something about crossing that much water?  No. Well yes, I guess so. (Laughter) One time we took a little old cruise and  went to the Bahamas. I looked at all that water out there and I said,    That   s a  lot of water to drink to keep from drowning.     Cause he doesn   t swim. He doesn   t like water.  She used to accuse me of not filling the bathtub over half full, afraid I   d  drown. (Laughter)  He and I have been to Canada a couple times.  Don   t have to cross too much water to do that.  No, I don   t think it really bothers me crossing the water, but I just really don   t  have any desire to go.  He sends us on trips.  I don   t like to be gone over three or four days. Last year we were gone     Fourteen.  Fourteen days and I   ll tell you, you spend 14 days on a bus, that   s a long time.  We saw Niagara Falls and Cape Cod.  Oh yes, it was neat you know, I mean but     He   d rather be at home working.  She   s got it right.  When he was a boy and going to school, his teacher said that when he  wouldn   t pay attention in school and he   d be looking out the window, she  knew exactly where his mind was. It was helping his dad on the farm. That   s  all he   s ever done is farm.  And you can tell her what the teacher told me.  I don   t remember now.  35  James  Joann  Finchum  James  Finchum  James  Joann  James  Joann  James  Finchum  Joann  James  Joann  James  Joann  James  Joann  James  If I didn   t get an education, I   d never amount to anything.  So we don   t have an education, but I don   t think we     I think you   re doing just fine.  Neither one of us have a high school education.  Well, you   ve done great.  If I just had a little more nerve a time or two, I could   ve done a whole lot  more.  We just decided we wanted to get married and nobody could talk us out of it  and we got married. And 56 years later, well we   re still here. (Laughs)  I was 17.  Seventeen in August and we were married in September.  It wasn   t a have-to case.  And the rest is history.  He worked on the turnpike building bridges when it was first started.  The bridge across the turnpike, across 66 highway down here, I helped build  that.  Messed his finger up.  Two overpasses west of there and the overpass that they tore out and rebuilt  here a year or so ago if you   ve been down the turnpike. I helped build the one  that was originally there and the bridge across the creek right west of it.  And you were probably 19, 18?  Probably 18.  He   s worked. Working is his hobby. He doesn   t hunt, he doesn   t fish, he likes  to visit. But work.  I was just a laborer down there. We dug the trenches for those bridges in  those fields. You know how wide a square point shovel is? We dug those four  foot deep by hand back then with a square point shovel and a pick. I took her  brother   s back pocket off one day with a pick. We were all in this trench  36  Finchum  James  Finchum  Joann  James  Joann  James  Joann  James  digging and either he backed up or I got too far and took his back pocket off  his overalls with a pick. (Laughter)  Missed the skin I hope.  Yes. Didn   t even skin him. The old man that was foreman, he was mean.  He   d stand up there on a bank and the words he used, all he wanted to see was  a back end and elbows. He wanted you digging all the time. And we dug  those trenches and done a little   we unloaded freight car loads of 90 pound  sacks of cement onto an old truck and hauled them up and then we had a  mixer and we mixed up cement and poured all those bridges. It was work.  Labor intensive.  Tell them about your finger.  Oh, one morning the old truck didn   t have antifreeze in it and the radiator  leaked. And oh it was cold that morning. I filled the old truck up with water.  It had two water pumps on each side of the old engine. The old water pumps,  of course, would freeze and stick and I   d just take a pair of pliers and tap  them and they   d break loose. I had a pair of gloves on but some way that  finger got through the fan belt. I just went on. And an hour or so or two hours  or something  later , my hand began to get warm and that finger began to  tingle and it hurt. I took my glove off and that finger went through the fan belt  and just mashed it. It had already turned blue and black. Told the foreman, he  said,    Well you better go see about that.    Did you come get me?  I think you came home.  I came home and she took me down to the doctor there in Chandler and he  was a good doctor but he was an older man. He was messing with that finger  and he said,    Well that nail   s loose.    And about that time he put a pair of  them deals on it and clamped them on and jerked that fingernail out. If it  hadn   t hurt so bad I   d hit him. (Laughter) Honest to God I   d hit him. But it  finally healed up but it was part of   but he just jerked that thing, oh. If I live  to be a 100 I won   t forget that. But you know, if you ever had your hands get  so cold you couldn   t feel them. But it didn   t make them guys any difference  in how cold it was, we worked.  And when that was over, we moved to Clinton for two weeks to   well you  can tell them, about building a bridge over there.  Right on this side of Clinton on 66 they were going to build a bridge across  the river there right on the edge of Clinton. They promised me a 25 cent an  hour raise if I   d go to Clinton with them. And I think I was making 90 cents  or a dollar down there on the turnpike and so I thought well, that wouldn   t be  37  Joann  James  Joann  James  Finchum  James  Finchum  Joann  Nykolaiszyn  James  Joann  James  a bad deal, we   d just go to Clinton. I followed this construction worker. Well,  got out there and oh it rained and the weather was bad and we were back  home a time or two. I got my check and that raise wasn   t on there. I just went  to the house or went to the motel room or whatever we were staying in, pack  it up, we   re going home. And then later on they sent me my 25 cents an hour  or whatever it was.  And then that   s when we started the dairy business.  So I went back to helping Dad milk and oh, I went to work for Lincoln  County just shortly after that.     54.  In 1954 I went to work for Lincoln County. I first started off down there as  just a laborer, bridge hand, and drive a truck or do whatever. And then they  found out that I   d done a lot of farm work so they asked me one day if I  wanted to run a dozer. So I started running the dozer and then cleared a lot of  section line right of ways, take the timber off between the fence and the road.  And then later on, run a motor grater for several years or for a few years and  run a dozer too, just whatever they had for me to do.  Kind of a supplemental income for the farm.  So that first 15 years was the only supplemental income we   ve ever had. Oh  well several years away here we   ve had a little dab of oil income, but we   ve  basically tried to save that for retirement, or most of it, until the last few years  and spent some of it traveling and still saved some of it, paid some income  tax.  And bought your tractor.  Several of them.  Has the farm always had those mineral rights or just recently?  No, back in the    50s on this farm my aunt had all the mineral rights and they  struck some oil on it. She got to selling some of the mineral rights to the oil  companies and this person and that person. And then my dad put a stop to it.  He didn   t know she was doing that.  He didn   t know she was doing it. He said,    Don   t do that, keep the mineral  rights.    Well then she divided some of the mineral rights up between some of  the family. And then she originally gave us like two acres, wasn   t it? No. She  didn   t give us any but she gave some to one of my aunts and she gave us the  38  two acres, but it was all divided up between her sisters and my dad. And then  later on after she passed we got what she had left, it came back to the farm,  which wasn   t very much. Then when my folks passed away, I think they had  like 12 acres and it came back to the farm. Then that oil played out and later  on they released it and we picked up a little override. We gathered some  leases and picked up a little bit of an override. It didn   t amount to a whole lot  but then that well has been out there since 1985. We don   t have a lot of  minerals under it but we have some.  And then later on we owned some land over east here and we bought the  surface on this 80 back in the early    60s and there wasn   t any minerals that  came with it. The original owner married a lady and after she died he got the  minerals under this 72 acres of them. This lady got in poor health so she gave  the minerals to a couple down at Chandler to look after, to kind of help her  with her business and she gave them to her. Well the lady died and he asked  her daughter, the middle daughter, she works at an abstract and title company  in Chandler, he got a hold of her I guess one day and he asked if we would  like to buy the minerals under that 80 that he had inherited from this lady. So  he called and I said well yes, we   d buy them. He said he and his wife didn   t  have any family to leave them to either and they were pretty well-fixed  financially themselves and I guess they   re still living.  So he asked me if I   d buy them, well yes we   d buy them. But he wanted about  twice as much for them as what I wanted give and I just made him an offer of  half what he asked for them and it rocked on them for some time, I don   t  know. One night he called me and wanted to know if that mineral offer was  still good. And I said,    You   ll have to refresh my memory because I don   t  remember,    he said,    Well you told me that you   d give me so much for that  royalty.    And I said,    Well, I guess I never made an offer that I wouldn   t  stand behind.    So he said,    I want to sell it to you.       Okay,    I said,    get some  kind of a deal where we   ll have proof of ownership and our daughter will just  go to the abstract office down there when you get that done and the lawyer  okays it, and she   ll just give you a check for it.     So it all worked. And it went on for years, I don   t know how many years,  several years. And one day an oil company called and wanted to lease it and I  said,    Well what are you paying?    I guess I was one of the first ones in  contact and he said,    We pay  50 an acre.    Well that   ll pay for the royalty,  cause that   s what I give for it. So I leased it to him, well we got our money  back so we didn   t have anything in it. Well and then about three or four years  ago, they pooled that section of land and they drilled a well on it and so we  had that 72 acres royalty and the well was good. And then we bought another  80 in that section a few years before and the bank had foreclosed on 20 acres  over there. The banker lady called Joann one day and said,    I see you bought  an 80 there, would you buy this 20 acres that I foreclosed on?    Joann just  said,    Well yes, what do you want for it?    I don   t remember what she told  39  Joann  James  Joann  James  Joann  James  Joann  James  Joann  James  her, but anyway, she just bought it. And I came home that evening from doing  something and she said,    I bought you 15 acres,    and I said,    Where?     (Laughter)  Wasn   t a good deal.  She told me   well yeah, but it wound up to be a good deal. She told me and I  said,    Do you know you bought the worse 15 acres in this country?     (Laughter) I said,    It   s nothing but solid brush and the old boy that owned it  cut all of the timber off of it for wood.    I said,    There ain   t nothing over there  but sprouts.     I said,    Well it was next to us, though.     You know what the old saying is?    I don   t want to own the whole country, I  just own what joins me.    You probably heard that. So anyway, and when the  banker lady made out the deed, she failed to exclude the royalty. And she  probably didn   t know whether she had any or not because her husband was  deceased. Anyway, it was three or four, five acres royalty under that in that  same section so we got that. And then we never did do anything with that 15  acres, I never did even open the gate between the two properties. The old boy  that bought the five that had the house on it out of that 20 come by here one  day and said he wanted to buy that 15. I don   t remember what I priced it at  but     We made a profit though.  Almost double what we   d give for it. And he took it. But when we did, if  there were any mineral rights, we excluded them. So that went in on that so  that helped considerably. And then on this place, there   s no one that owns  very many acres. We   ve probably got   do we even have 20 acres now?  I have no idea.  But one of my sisters is deceased and she deeded two acres back to us. But on  where I was born and raised, back years ago or back in the    50s they drilled a  little gas well over and it produced for a few years for the folks. Dad sold 30  acres off of that home place and there   s 130 acres royalty still over there and  then there   s an 80 that corners it to the north and he had all the royalty on it.  So when the folks deceased, that royalty is all split between four of us. So we  wound up with 50-something each one.  53 I think.  Each one of the kids wound up with 53 and a third acres of royalty. But  there   s no production on it   well there   s a well over there but it isn   t any  40  Joann  James  Finchum  Joann  James  Joann  Finchum  James  Joann  James  good. They drilled one of these Hunton horizontals where they go down and  drill that horizontal.  I thought this was a straight hole.  Well now this one over here   s a straight hole but it   s no good. That 50-some  acres, a few cents a month. (Laughter) And they quit producing it now, it   s  not good enough, it won   t pay the electric bill. But you asked me what I see  of agriculture in the future   very bleak. Even the big boys right now are  having problems. They   ve come in here and bought up this land and give big  prices for it and some of it   s for sale again now and it won   t bring what they  paid for it. We   ve got a quarter lease across the highway over here that we  lease the farmland on. The lady inherited it and she sold that one quarter and  we   ve only got like I said the farmland. The hearsay is she got  1,750 an acre  for it. There   s no way you can farm that old place, 35 acres of farmland and  the pasture on it might pasture ten cows. We let the guy that   s got the pasture  in it, he pastures the fields in the summertime after we harvest the crop off of  them. That   s the only way it   ll pasture ten cows, and the old boy give  1,750  an acre for it. And the house is not   it   s just an old house and the old barn  ain   t worth pushing down, and no fences at all. How they can do that     they   re getting their money somewhere else. I mean they   re making their  money somewhere else.  They may have royalties, too.  He works for an oil company.  Well he is an oil company.  He   s the big wig in Mobil oil.  Seems like you almost have to have an economics degree to figure some of  this stuff out.  Janet   s husband works for ScissorTail Gas Company and our middle  daughter, she works at Abstract and Guaranty Company in Chandler and her  husband works for Mercury at Stillwater and they got within about that far of  him the other day. He   s been there since    83 and they laid everybody off  down to    84. They went from 700 employees down to 170. And the oldest  daughter lives at Guthrie and she   s     She   s Head Cashier and then she   s Senior Vice President at the First Bank in  Chandler.  And her husband   s been teaching school for a long time and he   s trying to  retire this year.  41  Joann  James  Finchum  James  Finchum  James  Finchum  James  Joann  James  Joann  James  She wants to build a new home on the farm where he was born and raised.  But she drives 90 miles a day.  And runs a bank. He teaches school and plays golf.  Well that he can do here.  Yes.  Might hit a tree or two.  Yes. Well, there   s a golf course over here north of Chandler that isn   t far for  him. But she says when he retires   and he   s retiring this year   she says  they   re going to move closer to work because I don   t guess she has intentions  of retiring. Well she can   t, she   s 55.  Have to go another ten years just for insurance if nothing else.  Probably so. And believe me that Medicare and Aetna whole thing, the  supplemental insurance is high.  For both of us, our insurance is over  700 a month. That   s with Medicare  and     It   s what Medicare takes out and then our supplement. We have  HealthChoice.  Cause he worked for the county and so we   re covered by state insurance.  When I worked for the county we had Blue Cross and Blue Shield and they  started this little retirement thing I think a year or two years before I quit and  they asked me when I quit if I wanted to draw my retirement. Well I didn   t  know whether I was going to make it dairying or not so   it didn   t amount to  much so I said,    Just forget it, just freeze it or whatever you do with it.    So it  went on here and I just, you might say, forgot about it. And when I got to be  60, I got a letter   well even before that, we got a letter that we were a vested  employee and we could have the state insurance at a fee. Well at that time, it  was really better than Blue Cross and Blue Shield and a little cheaper. I  thought,    Well, that   d be alright.    Well then they got caught with their hand  in the till down there about that time and insurance went up and benefits  probably went down some, but we just kept it cause if you ever get out of  state insurance, you can   t get back in. And then when I was 60, we got a letter  saying,    Vested employee, you have to start drawing your retirement.    So she  called up there and said,    Well can   t we put this off until 65 or so and will it  keep growing?       No, you start drawing now or you don   t draw.    So, we  42  Joann  Finchum  James  Finchum  James  Joann  James  Joann  James  Finchum  James  started drawing it.  He draws  305 a month.  Almost half of your insurance.  Yes. Well, they do pay  100 a month health insurance or that   s what they say.  And then there   s a death benefit in there of  5,000.  Aren   t you glad you told them just to hold it?  Well yes, because back then we didn   t make any money and I bet I didn   t  have  300 or  400 that I could   ve actually drawn out of it that time. I don   t  have any idea, but it couldn   t have been much because I don   t know when  they started that retirement thing and I don   t think we had any choice of  whether we elected to it, it   s just something that happens.  So you know, I just figured well just leave it there, I might have to go back to  work in six months, I didn   t know, you know. (Laughs) But I don   t think a  young person could take this thing and draw a salary out of it and live if you  give it to them. That   s how much profit there is in it.  Well machinery   s so expensive.  Yes, that tractor was  62,000. I traded one in that was an    01 model and got   27,000 and that wasn   t enough, but that   s another story. (Laughter) I didn   t  think that was enough, but now since the economy has got bad, on a lot of this  new stuff they haven   t lowered the price but they   ve got some incentives.  Like for one thing, you buy something new, you get a warranty on it for  whatever that   s worth and then they   ve got some free interest and this and  that, some little rebates, you know. And so that entices people to buy the new  instead of going and borrowing money and paying five or six or seven or  eight percent interest, they can buy a new one and it   s free for three or four or  five years versus paying less money for a used one and then paying interest  on it and not having any warranty.  Normally we just write a check for it, but on this one he     I said well what I used to pay for it wasn   t making hardly anything, but it was  better than nothing. I mean you know, cause they got zero interest for three  years. Or I guess you could add it to 42 months as much as they had it. So  anyway, I did it. (Laughter)  And how many times have you been on it since then?  I haven   t, I   ve been up in it one time. They delivered this morning and I  43  Finchum  James  Joann  James  Joann  Finchum  James  Finchum  Joann  Finchum  James  Joann  Finchum  Joann  haven   t     Oh okay, so you haven   t had time yet.  Grandson   s over installing the bail monitor for the round bailer and we   ve got  a spray rig that   s got a foam applicator device in it that you put the foam on  the right side or the left side, so it   s a marker. He   s installing that.  This is the first new tractor or the first tractor that has a child seat in it. We  have a little four year old great-grandson that lives on the corner of the home  place over there.  She kept him one day a week for a long time. Then he got to where he was  pretty much a handful so he goes to daycare every day. But when she kept  him, if she couldn   t get him to go to sleep I   d take him riding on the tractor  and when we got back he   d be asleep, give her a break. (Laughter)  We have some donkeys and when he was about six months old, he would take  him to the barn and he would carry him in one arm and two five-gallon  buckets of grain in the other arm and feed the calves down there and that  donkey, well he   d stop and let Zach pet the donkey.  Hopefully in a few years he   ll be sitting here telling stories.  His dad says he will own that farm over there one way or another.  That   d be six generations then.  He said that he would be a farmer if he could make the money on the farm  that he makes   he works for Chesapeake. He started out at Hertz, his degree  is in Accounting.  From OSU?  Yes. He went two years at Edmond and then he switched to OSU.  But it took longer than two years to get through though. He couldn   t decide  what he wanted to be when he grew up. (Laughter) But he has been,  Michael   s dad   his parents were divorced when he was small, so Granddad   s  his dad. So he   s over here every weekend, he doesn   t want us to pay him or  anything. He   s got to be at the farm every weekend.  And get a little home cooking too, huh?  Sandwiches at noon. (Laughter) Nope that   s all they get at noontime and I  don   t even fix it until they walk in the door. I used to fix meals at noon, it  44  James  Joann  James  Joann  James  Joann  Finchum  James  Joann  Finchum  James  Joann  James  Finchum  James  might be two or three hours later he would be in, or he would say,    I   m going  up to town and eat with so and so,    and there I   d already cooked. So I got  where it   s sandwiches and when they walk in the door I fix it. Now do I tell  the other story? (Laughs)  Go ahead, you   re the one that   s talking.  On Sunday, I had roast, the whole bit, I fixed it. I was nice, I fixed him a  plate. It was about 3:30 or so he came in and I said,    Are you ready to eat?        Mm-hmm, I   m hungry.    I took the plate out and showed it to him and then  threw it on the back porch. (Laughs) I said,    The only thing I hated about that,  it broke my plate.    (Laughter) So since then, it   s sandwiches. You remember  that?  Yes, I remember it. (Laughter) But if you   re way off over here and you lack  an hour or 30 or 40 minutes     Yes, but you were in the shop that day though.  Oh, I don   t remember what I was doing that day but all I remember is     Your plate going by  (Laughter)  And you had a pocket watch I   d say.  No, I don   t, just wear a wristwatch. I don   t have any excuses not taking it out  of my pocket.  Now he didn   t grow up that way. His Dad, no matter what he was doing, if he  was baling hay or anything, he would shut down and he would go and eat his  lunch.  Same time every day probably?  Same time every day.  Supper the same way. But he didn   t inherit that from his dad though.  I   m guilty, no way about it, I   m guilty.  If you   re in the middle of something you   re going to finish?  Especially back years ago, I had such a schedule that well, you just done it,  you know. So anyway, that put me to eating sandwiches, which is no  problem. I can see her part of it, but I hate to quit if I lack 15, 20, 30 minutes  or an hour and come in and eat then have to go back and finish that then come  45  Finchum  James  Joann  James  Finchum  James  Finchum  James  Joann  James  back and milk. But all the time that we dairied, we   d get up and eat breakfast  in the morning. I   d go to the barn, and she   d do her housework and do the  dishes and then she   d come take my place at the barn and milk while I went  and fed the calves and fed the cows and then we were both there to finish  when we got through milking, finish up and clean up, and then I went on to  the field or whatever I needed to do.  Real team effort.  And then at night, I think part of the time you   d start and I   d come in and feed  the calves   or she   d get the cows in for sure out of the pasture and get started  and then I   d come in and feed and milk and she   d come back to the house for  a little while or this or that and then we   d both finish up and then come to the  house and eat supper.  And I do all of our book work and whatever has to be done. I used to do all  the mowing and then my knees kind of played out. Used to I wouldn   t let  anyone mow the yard, even around the garage or up the road and down the  road, I just wouldn   t let them mow it. But then after I had knee surgery, it  didn   t matter. (Laughter)  I inherited a lawnmower, too.  Push or ride?  Oh I haven   t pushed a lawnmower in so many years. I don   t know how many  riding mowers we have, but we   ve got a little Kubota that   s got a 54-inch  deck on it, got a little diesel mower in it that we mow the yard with and mow  up and down the section lines and then all the other section lines around every  place we own. I try to keep them mowed at least a couple times a year, down  all the roads. Try to keep where it looks half decent.  So what are we keeping you from doing today while we   re doing this? What  would you typically be doing?  Messing with that tractor, getting it ready to   when this ground dries up,  we   ve got to start spraying weeds and putting on some fertilizer. Got to, as  soon as it dries up. And we should be putting up some wheat hay but it   s just  too wet. We   ve got this old dozer but I don   t do any custom work. I feed the  cows in the winter time and run it in my spare time and clean up our own  property and I don   t know which is     That   s his fun job. He likes to run the dozer.  I could set on that old thing hours and hours.  46  Joann  Finchum  Joann  James  Joann  James  Finchum  James  Finchum  James  Joann  James  Joann  James  Nykolaiszyn  James  Finchum  As I said, work   s his hobby. But he never did fish or hunt or go to the coffee  shop or     Just came home for sandwiches. (Laughter)  Oh, no, later years I meant, he goes since we   ve not dairied, why he   ll go up  town and get     I don   t go to the coffee shop though. I go by that Indian store and get a cup of  cappuccino or a pop once in awhile, some when I   m feeding.  And he   ll always bring me some cappuccino.  Yes.  From five cents to what? A cup now is what?  Oh,  1.49. Of course back then it was a little bottle and now a 20 ounce is   1.49 I think. I don   t drink Cokes any more. But oh used to, if she was busy  or something we   d go up town and eat at the caf  . Last year when we were  fixing these fences I   d take this guy that helped us up there, two or three of us  to go up there and eat three hamburgers and maybe drink three glasses of tea,  it   ll be  18,  19. And maybe Dusty if he goes, he   ll maybe have a  cheeseburger and cottage cheese or something like that and he   d run it up  almost  20. And you know, you just can   t     Can   t do that daily.  You just can   t do it.  I   m always writing things down, I don   t know why, I guess I just like to, but  in April of    69, gasoline was 24.9 cents and in 1986, diesel was 59 cents.  And it got up to almost  4, farm fuel.  You might tell them about fertilizer, how much it   s gone up.  Last year nitrogen fertilizer got up to over  800 a ton. And it   s down to  400  now, somewhere around  400 now. Several years ago it was  90, you know   80,  90.  How much do you use normally? Roughly.  Oh, I don   t know how many ton we use.  That   s not something you can get and store.  47  James  Finchum  James  Finchum  James  Joann  James  Finchum  James  Joann  James  Finchum  James  No, you can   t hardly store that. I thought about it for the last two or three  years and haven   t done it, but you can buy this liquid fertilizer by the semi-load  and store it in fiberglass tanks and we could use it that way off the farm  and probably save a little bit of money. It would save if it was delivered here  to the farm in semi-load lots. You would save going to the co-op or going  someplace and picking it up. You   d actually save that much and maybe a little  bit more.  Time and money both.  You   d save some time and money both, yes. But I didn   t do it a couple of  years ago because she   s got a nephew that I think the world of all of them but  he would   ve probably wanted to use a lot of it on his farms too and he would  probably want to use quite a little bit of it and I just don   t like to do all them  things and I sure enough couldn   t tell the boy no. (Laughs) And he   s a good  person. I might do that later on.  Get your tractor paid for first.  Yes. There   s a lot of expensive stuff down here. We   ve got one that   s, oh it  was new in    05 and we   ve got one old tractor that   s kind of my standby. If  everything else don   t work, it does. So we   ve just got four.  And they   re all different   no, we   ve got two of the same brand name.  Two Kubotas, a McCormick, and a Ford.  No John Deere.  No way.  He was a John Deere  man  and then     I   ve been stung so many times on John Deere. We used to have a lot of green  equipment around here but we don   t have any. Got a grain drill and a blade  and an old stump disk, an old disk we use on timber where we clear the  timber; that   s all the John Deere there is here anymore. Got mad at the dealer  and told him what he could do with it. Haven   t been back in there for years.  After you buy a new tractor and then 2,700 hours you and the dealership have  spent  14,000 on it, it makes you a little raw.  I   d say so.  And then they tell you that you   re the only one having trouble with them and  he   s sold 20-something of them that year. And everybody you talk to, that   s  all we got is problems. Of that series, we had one that was in the first 100  numbers on the serial number. They said that was the most tested tractor they  48  Finchum  James  Finchum  James  Finchum  had ever built. And the biggest piece of junk you ever saw. At 2,700 hours I   d  had all I could handle of it.  Well is there anything else we haven   t covered that you   d like to add? We   ve  covered quite a bit.  If you   ve got any questions I   ll try to answer them.  Thank you for having us today.  Thank you for coming.  It   s been fun.  -------  -------
