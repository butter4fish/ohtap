Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now, before we go into depth, there are five lightweight People magazine-ish type questions that management compels me to ask that only require a short answer.  The first one is--they're kind of like a warm up--the first one is do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: Do I have a favorite food?  Yes, I have a favorite food, and you want to know what it is?

Story_ID: 570137
Speaker 1: I'm going to ask you about your family history.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I'm going to ask about your mother's side of the family, and your father's [Elmo L. Moore, Sr.] side, but we'll start with your mother's side first.  Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: My mother's full time is Delma Mae Smith Moore, D-E-L-M-A, M-A-E, Smith, S-M-I-T-H, Moore, M double O R-E, M-O-O-R-E [Delma Smith Moore].
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: She, she was born--oh, what year was she born?  She was born August 29th, twenty-two years before I was born.
Speaker 1: Okay, so 1921, I guess?
Speaker 2: Nineteen twenty-one [1921].
Speaker 1: All right.  And where was she born?
Speaker 2: She was born in Portsmouth, Virginia.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what do you know about the ancestors on your mother's side?  How far back, first of all, can you trace them?  They go all the way back to slavery days or what?
Speaker 2: Well, my sister has, has been working on that now for several years.  And she's been able to trace it all the way back to about 1870.  And that's just prior to slavery, or just right into slavery, and now she is in the process of, of going to look at documents in that area, like Bibles and other historical documents, seeing if she can find who the slave owner was of our ancestors, and maybe trace it that way.  But she gets stuck once she gets to a certain point, so back to about 1870.
Speaker 1: Probably if she's going into slavery, it's back a little bit further than that 'cause we were free in 1870, so she's going back probably to the 18- I guess '50s [1850s] or '60s [1860s], I guess.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it might have been about 1860, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.  So, has she uncovered anything?
Speaker 2: Well, she's uncovered quite a bit regarding my mother, and my mother's side of the family.  And we have a family reunion every two years that involves the Smiths, the Epps [ph.], the Jenkins [ph.], and the Liebermans [ph.], who are all ancestors that have come, you know, over the years.  So, yeah, she's been able to find quite a bit.  She is--we call her the roots in the family.
Speaker 1: Well, are there any stories from that period of time?  I mean, do they know what some of your ancestors did, you know, what kind of work they did or what, are there any stories associated with what they were doing?
Speaker 2: I--she hasn't shared that with me if she's found anything like that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, do you have the general impression that they were farmers, or did they have any special skills or?
Speaker 2: I have a general impression from what she shared with me that they were probably farmers in that area, and working on farmland in that, in that area, sometimes working for people, probably white people at that time because they didn't own any property.  And I, I can remember back as, as with regards to my grandmother that's on the other side [Margaret Trotter Moore] and her sisters, and then, the woman that raised my mother, stories of them talking about how they had grown up on farms in that area, you know, and things like that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, is--so the family has a history--it's all around the Portsmouth area--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --really?  There's no other place that they talk about?
Speaker 2: Nope, not that I've, not that she's told me.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 570138
Speaker 1: Did you know your grandparents?
Speaker 2: I did not know my grandparents.  My mother's mother died when she was very young, probably at twelve years old, and my mother [Delma Smith Moore]--there were thirteen of them.  And my mother was, she was the third oldest child.  And so, she was the third oldest--she was the third oldest child, and she was the girl, so she ended up having to basically raise the younger children after her mother passed.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, that--
Speaker 2: And so--
Speaker 1: --did she have any stories to tell about that experience?
Speaker 2: Well, the--my mother did that for about two years, and then, before she met my father [Elmo L. Moore, Sr.], because she got married when she was fourteen years old.  And even after she and my dad got married, and she had her first child, she was still taking care of some of her younger siblings, my aunts and uncles at that time that were very young.  There were twins in the family.  There were two sets of twins that she had to care for, as well as the other children.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, she didn't have a--her childhood was kind of cut short, I guess, by trying to--
Speaker 2: Her childhood was cut very short.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, 'cause at fourteen, she was married, and she started having her family.
Speaker 1: She was taking care of the rest of her brothers and sisters at twelve, I guess?
Speaker 2: Taking care of the rest of her brothers and sisters at twelve.
Speaker 1: And married at fourteen?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  At--
Speaker 1: Now, did, was your father still around?
Speaker 2: Her father?
Speaker 1: Yeah, her father.
Speaker 2: I, you know, and I don't hear that much--I didn't hear my mother talking that much about the, her father, but I knew the father was in their lives.  I--she, I never heard her saying that much about it.  And I, I'm thinking that he must have passed before my grandmother did, so that, that's why she ended up having to take care of the children.  And I think during that, during those times, it wasn't that men totally left out of the lives of the women, but they weren't as involved in--her dad probably wasn't as, as involved in raising the family as her mother had been.
Speaker 1: So, you suppose she had other relatives that helped out maybe when she, after her mother passed?
Speaker 2: The--I have, I, I don't recall her talking about other relatives helping out.  It sounded to me, like my mother and her older brothers kind of had to fend for the family and take care of everyone.
Speaker 1: So, she had older brothers and then--
Speaker 2: She had a couple of older brothers 'cause she's like the third oldest child and, but she was the girl in the family, so I guess it just fell on her at the age of twelve to take care of those younger brothers and sisters.
Speaker 1: Yes, so she had to be the woman of the house, I guess?
Speaker 2: She had to be the woman of the house.
Speaker 1: Yeah, at age twelve, and they did the heavy farm work, I guess--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --her brothers, okay.  All right, now I understand.
Story_ID: 570139
Speaker 1: So, your mother [Delma Smith Moore] was married [to Elmo L. Moore, Sr.] at age fourteen?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And I know, from looking at the pictures, that she became a nurse.  Now--
Speaker 2: Yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) did it, did she, was she able to finish school before she got married or did she have to finish after?
Speaker 2: She, she didn't finish school, you know, before fourteen.  But when she started having children later on in her life when, when, I believe it was when I got up some size, I was the fourth child that she had, and her last child [Patricia Moore Cooper] was five years after me.  Before that, she had been having children every two years, and then I can remember being very young when I started to school [at Chestnut Street School; I.C. Norcom High School, Portsmouth, Virginia].  She started working, she started working in the laundry at the naval hospital [Naval Hospital Portsmouth; Naval Medical Center Portsmouth, Portsmouth, Virginia].  And then, and then, she went on and she learned how to do hair, so she became a at home beautician.  And then later on, she went back to school, when I was in junior high school [Crestwood High School, Chesapeake, Virginia], about junior high school, she went back and got her GED [General Educational Development].  And then, once she got her GED, she had been working at the naval hospital.  And so she had gotten to know doctors and nurses and people in that field while she was working in the laundromat over at the hospital.  And later on, she went, you know, she just went on and pursued a license in nursing and became an LPN nurse.
Speaker 1: Okay.  About what year did she get her degree as an LPN [licensed practical nurse]?
Speaker 2: I'm going to say it was 1959, '60 [1960].
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, okay, so she did, so did she retire as a nurse?  Did she work (unclear)?
Speaker 2: She did.  She retired as a nurse from the naval hospital in Portsmouth, Virginia, LPN nurse.  She was working in pediatrics--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --at the naval hospital.
Story_ID: 570140
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us.
Speaker 2: Elmo, E-L-M-O, Leonard, L-E-O-N-A-R-D, Moore, Sr. [Elmo L. Moore, Sr.].
Speaker 1: Okay.  His name is very popular now, you know, Elmo with 'Sesame Street' so (laughter) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yeah, that's right.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  And what is his date--
Speaker 2: You know, the, the, the craziest thing happened when I moved to Salt Lake City [Utah].  Met a very dear friend.  We're like sisters now, both AKAs [Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority], of course.  But she wasn't pregnant at the time and then, we would go skiing, and then, finally, one day, she said, "I'm going to have a baby."  So, she had a little girl.  And just out of the clear blue, she started calling this child Elmo.  I said, "Why did you call her Elmo?"  She doesn't know why, she just called her Elmo, but the child's name is not Elmo.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But that, that's was the nickname.  I thought that was kind of odd.
Speaker 1: That is odd.
Speaker 2: Yeah, but Elmo is a popular name now because of that toy animal.
Speaker 1: Yeah, on 'Sesame Street.'
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Who is actually the only black charac- well, it's, it's voiced by a black puppeteer, you know?
Speaker 2: Is it--Elmo is?
Speaker 1: Yeah, Kevin, Kevin [HistoryMaker Kevin Clash]--I can't think of his last name, but at any rate, but that's, yeah.  Well, let's see, and what is your father's date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Well, my dad is five years older than my mother [Delma Smith Moore], so she's '21 [1921].  So, five from '21 [1921], okay, so--
Speaker 1: Okay, 1916, I guess so--
Speaker 2: Something like that, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And my dad was born July 14th--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --in Portsmouth, Virginia.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what do you do know about his side of the family?  How far back can you trace them?
Speaker 2: Actually, I don't have a lot of information on him.  I knew his--his mother, my grandmother, because she helped to raise us.  So, I knew her very well.  And I, I knew that his, his father, we never met his father.  We knew our stepfather [sic. step-grandfather], but that's as far back as I, you know, I know it goes back to the Trotters, and my sister is studying that part of the history as well.
Speaker 1: So it goes back to a family--
Speaker 2: Trotters.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yes.  My grandmother's, my grandmother's maiden name was Trotter [Margaret Trotter Moore].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so, it goes back to the Trotters.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, is she related to the famous Trotters?  William Monroe Trotter and--
Speaker 2: I'm not sure.  We'll find out (laughter).
Speaker 1: All right, okay.  So, are there any stories from your father's side of the family about slavery or Reconstruction or?
Speaker 2: Nope.  All, all--I remember, my grandmother and her sisters, my grandmother worked at the naval hospital [Naval Hospital Portsmouth; Naval Medical Center Portsmouth, Portsmouth, Virginia], too, and I just remember her working there all my life.  She, she was a dietitian, and I remember her sisters, the two sisters that I knew, worked.  They actually were, were housekeepers or house cleaners.  And I remember going to work with her, her youngest sister sometimes to clean homes because she would go out, and she would ride a bus, and go out to some white folks' homes and clean the homes, or she would go out to buildings and clean buildings, but that's as, as much as I can remember.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But they didn't tell any stories about what life was like down there?  Did you get an impression from them what, you know, what it was like to live down there, you know, what the parameters were, what the scene was or?
Speaker 2: What I gathered from them was that it was a very tight little community.  They kind of lived all in the same sort of block, or within blocks of each other, in (unclear) type homes or little cottages.  I got an impression that life was tough that, that they had to work all the time.  They had to work hard and that on weekends was the time to relax.  On Friday nights, they would go out and they would get fish, so that they could have fish on Saturday and fish for breakfast on Sunday morning.  But I got, I got the impression that life was tough, that nothing was easy for them, that they had to work a lot.
Story_ID: 570141
Speaker 1: Now did your father [Elmo L. Moore, Sr.] ever talk about what his goals were and if he, you know, was satisfied with what he was doing or?  Now, he worked primarily as a farmer?  Is that true?  No--
Speaker 2: No, my dad, my dad--the work that I remember him doing was, he was in the [U.S.] Navy when I was younger.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I remember him leaving, leaving home to go and serve duty in the Navy and then coming home.  But then, when he got out of the Navy, he went to the naval shipyard [Norfolk Naval Shipyard, Portsmouth, Virginia], and he worked there as a foreman at the naval shipyard.  My dad--I got the impression that my dad expected more of himself than he was able to really get out of life before he passed away because I got the impression that he was quite intelligent, and that he had wanted to pursue other things in life.  But he ended up really just being a foreman.  As far as he could see, that was as far up as he could do in life, was to be that foreman at the naval shipyard, but that he really wanted more out of life.  He just couldn't have it.  And so, one of the things I remember him and my mother [Delma Smith Moore] saying was that it was important for us to go on, and go to school and not complain because they wanted more for us out of life than they had gotten for themselves.  And my mother would often say, "You have to be careful out there.  You don't want to start your family too soon."  You know, because it, it was hard on her to go back and get her high school diploma, rather than get it when, you know, before she got married at fourteen.  So, she always impressed upon us to, to do that first, and then think about moving on with your life.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, now did your father have a chance to finish school before he went to the Navy?  Now, that was World War II [WWII], right?  That--was he drafted into World War II or did he join, or what happened?
Speaker 2: I think he signed up to go, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And he did finish high school.  He finished I.C. Norcom High School [High Street School; I.C. Norcom High School] in Portsmouth, Virginia, so he graduated from high school.  My mother was fourteen (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I'm sorry, I.C.--
Speaker 2: I.C. Norcom, N-O-R-C-O-M, N-O-R-C-O-M.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I, I period C period Norcom.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: In Portsmouth, Virginia.
Speaker 1: I.C. Norcom High School.  Now, do you know who I.C. Norcom [Israel Charles Norcom] was?  I imagine it's somebody black down there they named the school for, but I don't know.
Speaker 2: It must have been--I don't know.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, okay, so he finished high school before he went to the--
Speaker 2: He did.  He, he had finished high school by the time he and my mother got married.  And she was fourteen, he was nineteen--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --so he had already completed high school.
Story_ID: 570142
Speaker 1: Tell us something about how they met.  Now is there a story associated with how they met?  Did they tell a story?
Speaker 2: Let me think.  Well, my mother [Delma Smith Moore] wasn't supposed to be dating because she was way too young.  And my grandmother [Margaret Trotter Moore] would say to my dad [Elmo L. Moore, Sr.], "You leave that girl alone because, you know, she's just a girl.  You are, you finished high school [High Street School; I.C. Norcom High School, Portsmouth, Virginia], you're a young man, you leave that girl alone."  But they had to sneak around and see each other, and that's what happened.  And that's, that's how they met, you know, sneaking around in the neighborhood, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, so they didn't, he didn't heed their advice (laughter)?
Speaker 2: No, he didn't.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 570143
Speaker 1: Now when you think about your parents' personalities, their talents and dispositions, and--who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: I think I take a lot after my mother [Delma Smith Moore], some with my dad [Elmo L. Moore, Sr.], but I think I take most, most of my characteristics after my mother.  She was a very soft spoken woman, but she was a very determined person.  And I think that can be seen in the fact that she finished high school and got married so young, but yet, she went on and c- not high school, she, she finished high school after she had gotten married.  Then, she got married so young at age fourteen, but then, she persevered and went on and got her high school certificate by completing her GED [General Educational Development], and then went on to become a nurse.  I think, I think she had a determination to do something in her life, too.  And she was kind of reserved about hers.  My dad was a little more outspoken about where he wanted to go in life, but he never did get where he wanted to go.  And she kind of sat back and made a determination that she wanted to do something, and she did it.  And all the while, she did that while she was still raising her children.  And I think she just instilled in me, you do something with your life because if you don't, no one else is going to do it for you.  And I just, I think she had a, a quiet, strong spirit about her that some of it just rubbed off on me.
Story_ID: 570144
Speaker 1: Now, what is it that your dad [Elmo L. Moore, Sr.] wanted to do, you think, you know, that he didn't get a chance to do?
Speaker 2: I think my dad wanted to, I think he wanted to own a business, or he wanted to be a politician, or he wanted to be a lawyer, something like that because he, he talked a lot, and he knew that he was intelligent, but there was something that was holding him back from moving forward with his life.
Speaker 1: Did he talk about his experiences in the [U.S.] Navy?  Now, I, you know, we've interviewed a lot of people that were in the Navy during the war, or soldiers, too, and it wasn't easy, being in World War II [WWII].  Did he talk, ever talk what happened over there?  The Navy was supposed to be particularly tough 'cause you're at sea and, you know, and they were restricted on, you know, what black sailors can do and couldn't do.
Speaker 2: I think my dad did what he needed to do and kept out of trouble, but he was always glad to come home.  So I, I'm not sure that he truly enjoyed his experience in the Navy.  He never said that it was, it was the greatest thing in life for him.  I think he joined the Navy anticipating that this would take him to some other point in his life and help him to reach his dream, and it didn't.  He, he did end up getting out of the Navy, and when he got out of the Navy, that's when he went to the shipyard [Norfolk Naval Shipyard, Portsmouth, Virginia] and started working there.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  But he didn't have--there are no stories that you remember about what happened in the Navy or?
Speaker 2: Unh-uh.
Speaker 1: So, he didn't even talk about it (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Not that I--no, not that I can remember, unh-uh.
Speaker 1: Did he go very far away from the U.S., or did he stay around?
Speaker 2: He, he, he didn't go very far away.  He was in, oh, Michigan?  He wasn't, he was still, he was up north of where we lived [in Portsmouth, Virginia], but it wasn't out of the country.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Was it the Great Lakes naval training center [Naval Station Great Lakes, Lake County, Illinois]--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --on Lake Michigan, is that where?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Near Chicago [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: I remember that being one of the ones, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Story_ID: 570145
Speaker 1: Do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: Do I have an early--?
Speaker 1: Earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: My earliest childhood memory?  My earliest childhood memory is probably when we lived on 2nd Avenue [ph.] in Portsmouth, Virginia, which was just right around the corner from the, the ballpark.  And I believe that ballpark--well, it might be gone by now.  But my earliest memory was that we, we lived in this two story home.  And it was my mother [Delma Smith Moore], my father [Elmo L. Moore, Sr.], my brother [Elmo L. Moore, Jr.], my sister, the one that's the historian, and my older sister.  And my older sister spent a lot of time with my grandmother on my dad's side [Margaret Trotter Moore].  My grandmother on my dad's side--my aunt, was, was close to my oldest sister's age, and they spent a lot of time together.  But I remember my dad putting the, the kids that were home--that would be my sister, Margaret [Margaret Moore Davenport], my brother and me, putting us on his bicycle, and riding us on his bike--three people, along with the, the biker, taking us from our home on 2nd Avenue to my grandmother's house, and she lived on Effingham Street [Virginia State Route 141] in Portsmouth, Virginia.  So, when I, when I was able to walk it by himself, I thought that was quite a distance for a biker to take th- put three kids on, but he would take us around on his bike.  And that was one of the place he would transport us to.
Speaker 1: How was that done?  I mean, three, three kids on, and a--
Speaker 2: I--if I remember correctly, I remember there was a basket on the front, and I remember being placed in that basket a lot.  And then, I remember seeing people on the back of the bicycle, so I think there was a rack on the back where my brother and my sister could sit.  And then, my dad would, would, you know, be on the bike.  Now, that was before he got his first car that I can remember.  And the first car, I remember him having was this old Chrysler, this, it was a big car.  And then, after he got the Chrysler, then--we were still on 2nd Avenue, he would put us all in the car, and then he would drive us different places.  And one of the place, one of the furthest places we ever went was to Washington, D.C. in the Chrysler.  So, I mean, I have other little memories of early childhood.  You want to hear them?
Speaker 1: Well, yes.  Well, we always ask this question.  Well, you mentioned something interesting, though, the ballpark.  Was that a, was, what was the ballpark?  Was that like a--
Speaker 2: It was a baseball bar- ballpark.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It's a baseball field.  And I can remember walking over to the baseball field, and it had bars on the front of the baseball field.  And we were so small--we didn't have money to go in--but we were small, we could put our heads through the bars, turn our bodies around, and go in and watch the games.
Speaker 1: Now, were those the Negro Leagues playing there?  Or who was playing there, do you know?
Speaker 2: No, I don't remember seeing Negro Leagues.  I remember seeing white--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --white leagues, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: I, I also remember, I remember that ballpark.  And then, I remember we lived on 2nd Avenue, and our house was like the last house on 2nd Avenue before this wide open field.  And beyond that field was where white people lived, so the whites started that neighborhood on the other side of the field.  And I can remember my mother saying to us, "Don't go across that field.  You stay--you can play in the field, you can play at home, but don't go into the field."
Story_ID: 570146
Speaker 1: So, your mother [Delma Smith Moore] warned you about going across that field?
Speaker 2: "Go--don't go across that field," she would, she would say to us.  She said, "You, you may play out there--," because it was--they had some playground equipment, but I remember a lot of weeds being out there, too.  But there was an open space where we could go out and play ball, and then, we could play on the swings.  But she said, "Do not go beyond that field because then you'll be in territory where they don't want you."  And so, what would happen, we got to be friends with some of the white kids.  And so, what would happen, the kids would come over, the white kids would come over to the field where we were playing the ball and play with us.  And that's how we got to mix and mingle with white children at that time--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --because we weren't allowed to.
Speaker 1: So, they could come over, if they wanted to, but--
Speaker 2: They could come over to the field where we were, but they, they didn't come over to our neighborhood, and we didn't go over to their neighborhood.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: As a matter of fact, I never went through that neighborhood until probably after I had graduated from high school [Crestwood High School, Chesapeake, Virginia] and was in college [Virginia State College; Virginia State University, Petersburg, Virginia].  And when I came back, we had moved from that, from that area, but I wanted to see what it was like, so I drove, drove over that way.  Well, I had some--a friend to take me over that way to see what it was like.
Speaker 1: Now, was there a difference in the way the communities looked?
Speaker 2: There was a difference in the way the communities look, looked because the black side was the poor side.  And the white side was the green side, the richer looking side.  We were told when we were growing up to--when, when you would walk from the neighborhood to walk close to the homes.  Don't walk out towards the sidewalk.  You walk close to the buildings or closer to the homes.  By that time, the--when I was growing up, it was a city, so we, I didn't grow up on a farm.  I lived in a--Portsmouth [Virginia] for the--Portsmouth was a city by the time I came along.  And so, when we would leave 2nd Avenue [ph.] to, let's say, walk to school, or to walk to the grocery store, my mother would tell us, "You walk close to s- to the building.  Don't look at white people.  You keep your eyes turned.  You stay focused because you don't want to get in trouble."
Speaker 1: So, this is, you know, in the '40s [1940s], early '50s [1950s].
Speaker 2: This is the '40s [1940s], '50s [1950s].  And--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --I didn't understand it then, but I did as I got older.  This was Jim Crow.  And in that time, blacks had their places which, which my family--my, my grandmother on my dad's side [Margaret Trotter Moore], and my mom and my dad [Elmo L. Moore, Sr.] all were very aware of it.  So, they warned us not to go to certain places, not to walk in certain places.  When you get on the bus, you make sure you go all the way to the back of the bus.  Never sit in the front of the bus.  So, yeah, it was Jim Crow days.
Speaker 1: Did you have to enter the bus from the back door or did you--?
Speaker 2: No, you entered the bus from the front, and you go in and you put your money in, and then you walk to the back.  And you pass seats in, in the back, sometimes the back would be full.  People would be standing up, and there would be the seats in the front, but you couldn't dare sit in, in those seats in the front.  I mean, we were told, "Don't sit in the front of the bus.  You get on the bus, you look straight ahead, and you walk to the back of the bus.  If it's a seat, you sit down.  If it's not, you stand up but, but never are you to sit in the front of the bus."
Speaker 1: Now, did you ever see anybody get in trouble for doing the wrong thing?
Speaker 2: Sitting in the--?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: No, I, I cannot remember seeing anyone get in trouble for sitting in the wrong or doing the wrong thing.  But I can remember what, what part--maybe I'm going a little ahead of myself.  In terms of the bus, when I was, went to college, I would ride the Greyhound bus, and I'd just--I have things that I can tell you about that when I was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.  Well, we'll get to that--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --but when you were little, you never saw anybody really get in trouble?
Speaker 2: When I was little, I didn't see anybody get in trouble for doing anything.  I'm sure it was happening, but I didn't see it.
Story_ID: 570147
Speaker 1: Can you now describe, I guess, what your neighborhood [in Portsmouth, Virginia] looked like, and what were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: I can remember we lived in, like I said, the last house before the field started.  Well, just on, on the right side of our home, the man next door had a garden.  I think he owned the property.  He lived on our left, but on the right, he had a large garden area.  And I can remember us going out in that garden area, and getting tomatoes and eating tomatoes right off the vine.  I can remember the smell of hay in the, in the farmhouse 'cause he still had a little farm, like in his barn, I can remember the smell of hay.  Now, why he had hay, I, I don't remember.  Maybe it was just for some animals that he had, but I remember that part.  And I remember on the corner, going the other direction towards the ballpark, right on the corner from my house, was Mr. Mack's store.  And Mr. Mack [ph.] always had something on a little potbelly stove in his store that was always boiling, and we never could figure that out.  But the reason we went to Mr. Mack's store was to buy candy and gum 'cause it only cost a penny.  You could get maybe five pieces for a penny, and I can remember buying pickles.  He would have big, large jars of pickles, and you could buy a pickle for a nickel.  And then, you could take another penny or a nickel, and get some candy, candy canes or, or some kind of peppermint candy to put in the pickle.  So I remember that, and I also remember--
Speaker 1: So, they were doing that way back then, too?
Speaker 2: Way back then, they were doing that then.  I can also remember that we didn't have a television and TVs came out in the '50s [1950s], did they not?  In the '50s [1950s].  And so, the first TV that came out wasn't our TV.  It belonged to a neighbor that lived around the corner that had--I think there were two children that lived in the home probably close to my age.  And the parents would allow us, from our home, and a few other kids in our neighborhood, to come over to their home to watch TV, watch certain shows, like 'Howdy Doody' time ['The Howdy Doody Show'], you know, like 'Roy Rogers' ['The Roy Rogers Show'].  These were the television shows that we, we were watching about that time.  And then, I can remember when we finally did get a TV, there were shows that came on, like 'Amos 'n' Andy,' which I could not, I did not like 'Amos 'n' Andy.'  I remember bits and pieces of 'I Love Lucy'--didn't like that either.  And I, and I think the reason I didn't like 'em, because 'Amos 'n' Andy' people, they were doing hurtful things.  And the same thing with Lucy, she was always hurting herself.  My favorite shows to watch were shows, like 'Roy Rogers and Dale Evans' ['The Roy Rogers and Dale Evans Show'], and 'Howdy Doody,' and watching--with Mickey Mouse?
Speaker 1: 'The Mickey Mouse Club.'
Speaker 2: 'The Mickey Mouse Club,' that was a favorite because I think that was like a dream.  Everybody wanted to be like the singers on 'Mickey Mouse'--in 'The Mickey Mouse Club.'  So, those were the kinds of the things that I remembered.  I remember there was a cemetery not far from our home, and we, as kids, made ourselves afraid to walk by the cemetery.  So, when we got to the cemetery, we would cross, go across the street to walk on the other side of the street--never on the side of, where the cemetery was.
Speaker 1: So, you're saying, you, as kids, made yourselves afraid of--
Speaker 2: We made ourselves because--
Speaker 1: Were there--
Speaker 2: --the parents, our parents [Delma Smith Moore and Elmo L. Moore, Sr.] didn't tell us, "Don't walk near the cemetery."  But we, as kids, say--well, everyone over there is gone--dead.  We don't want to be over there.  You know how kids tell stories.
Speaker 1: Were there any ghost stories associated with--
Speaker 2: You know, my, my older sister, when my older sister used to come, 'cause she spend her time between my [paternal] grandmother's [Margaret Trotter Moore] house and our home on 2nd Avenue [ph.].  And when she used to come, I could remember there would be two or three of us in the bed.  And my older sister--we called her Peaches--would tell us stories.  And some of the stories were ghost stories, but then, some of the stories were pretty friendly stories.  She was a great storyteller, too.  So, I can remember that as a little kid.  I must have been, hm, five, six, seven, probably up to age eight or nine, we were in that house--
Speaker 1: Okay, now--
Speaker 2: --on 2nd Avenue.  And then, we moved.
Story_ID: 570148
Speaker 1: What kind of neighborhood did you move to--I mean, was it a bigger house or something or what?
Speaker 2: Well, it was--then, it was a new house [in Portsmouth, Virginia].  We moved from an older house to a newer house.  And we moved out--
Speaker 1: Now, what kind of homes did people have?  Did they have the--were those the shotgun kind of homes with the three rooms, or were they bigger or what, what kind?
Speaker 2: The house that we lived in on 2nd Avenue [ph.] I thought was a pretty big house, from what I can remember as a child.  It was, it had an upstairs and a downstairs.  So, I remember the staircase on the left as you walk in the front door.  On the right, there was the living room, then there was a dining area, you know, they called it a parlor then.  And then, the back of the house, there was a kitchen and you go upstairs.  There was a room, my mother [Delma Smith Moore] and father's [Elmo L. Moore, Sr.] bedroom, beyond the steps going that way.  And then, there was a room in the middle, which most of us slept in.  Then, there was another smaller room behind that, so the house had three bedrooms, and a bathroom.  So, I thought it was a pretty good size house.  But then, I was, you know, I was a kid running up and down the steps, sneaking down to open presents under the Christmas tree, you know, when we were told, "Don't come down those stairs."
Speaker 1: So, you not only looked, you opened them up (laughter)?
Speaker 2: Well, I don't think they were wrapped.  We could see, like we could see bicycles or dolls or trains or something because during those days, the parents would--you would go to bed.  And then, they would come out, and they would set everything out before, you know, before you came down the next morning.  So, I can remember tipping down the stairs with my cousin, and peeking and looking to see what we had.  We didn't get all the way down, but we could see the things before we got all the way down there.
Story_ID: 570149
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now, you mentioned earlier the trip to D.C. [Washington, D.C.].  How old were you when you, when your father [Elmo L. Moore, Sr.] took you all to Washington, and was that, that your first trip to D.C.?
Speaker 2: That was my first trip to D.C.  I don't know, I must have been maybe seven or eight, and I remember seeing things like the monument [Washington Monument] and the White House, the zoo, the Washington zoo [National Zoological Park; Smithsonian's National Zoo and Conservation Biology Institute], which, which was one of the main reasons we went, to go to the, to the zoo, and to see some places there, too.  Vaguely I can remember that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, it didn't make a big impression on you I gather that--
Speaker 2: Well, what made an impression on me was traveling along that highway, and thinking that I was going far away, and thinking that, that was a good life, a great life someplace that--.  I guess I was, that's what I probably took after my dad: dreaming, dreaming of something better.  And so when we would travel, I would see things getting better, yeah.
Story_ID: 570150
Speaker 1: You moved at age nine to a new house?  So--
Speaker 2: To a new house, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: It was a new--I think we were one of the first ones to move in on Bunche Boulevard in, in Victory Man- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now, was it named Bunche, like Ralph Bunche?
Speaker 2: Like Ralph, it was named after Ralph Bunche, Bunche Boulevard.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, this was a black development, new, okay.
Speaker 2: It's a black development.  It was called Victory Par- Victory Manor [Portsmouth, Virginia].
Speaker 1: Victory Manor?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: That sounds, sounds like somebody was--and trying--I mean, it sounds inspirational, the whole thing, Ralph Bunche Boulevard.  What were some of the other names of the streets?
Speaker 2: Oh.  Let's see, Victory Boulevard, Ralph Bunche, Theodore Roosevelt--so there was a Theodore Street [ph.], and there's a Roosevelt street [Roosevelt Boulevard].  Those are, those are the ones that come to mind right now, yep.
Speaker 1: Okay.  No streets named after any other black heroes, or?
Speaker 2: Not that I can think of right now (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, all right, all right.  So, so this is a new development.
Story_ID: 570151
Speaker 1: Now, I want to go back a minute and like, where did you start grade school?
Speaker 2: Oh, I'm glad you asked.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: When I was, before I started to school, my siblings were already going to school.  And I can remember sitting at home on 2nd Avenue [ph.] with my mother [Delma Smith Moore], with my face pressed against the window, wanting to go to school, too, but I was too young.  I was four, so I kept thinking when I turn five, I'll go to school, but I didn't go to school when I was five.  And if I can recall correctly, I was the only child that didn't go to kindergarten in my family, but everyone else went.  But I did go to school when I turned six.  And I went to first grade at Chestnut Street elementary school [Chestnut Street School, Portsmouth, Virginia], which was down by I.C. Norcom High School [High Street School; I.C. Norcom High School, Portsmouth, Virginia].  And I can remember the first day of school.  I had, I must have had a book bag or something similar to a book bag.  And when I got to this big school, for some reason, I put my book bag down, and then it just disappeared.  And I was just devastated, I was so devastated.  So, when I got in the classroom, I can remember my teacher, my first grade teacher was Mrs. Paige [ph.], a very tall woman, fair complexion, who wore a, that ball on top of her head.  And evidently, I remember her because she was so kind because I was so devastated 'cause my bag was gone, my books were gone.  And she took care of me.  She said, "Don't worry about it, you know, I'll get you another one."  And by the end of the day, I was calmer because she had calmed me down, and she'd given me--it must have been a notebook and pen or pencil, or something like that.  But she was my first and second grade teacher. Now, if I were to, if you would ask me about my third grade teacher, I can't remember her.  Fourth grade, I can't remember.  Sixth, I can.  But my first grade teacher--my first, second grade teacher, Mrs. Paige, I'll always remember her 'cause she was so kind.  Teachers impact children's lives.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, did you ever get your notebook--I mean, your book bag back?
Speaker 2: She gave me, she gave me something else to carry my books in.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And she gave a notebook and pencil and, you know, she took care of me.  So, so school for me that year after the first day, the first morning, school for me was great because I had Mrs. Paige.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, now, did you have a favorite subject at school?
Speaker 2: My favorite subject, I probably didn't venture into a favorite subject until I was about fourth or fifth grade and that would turn out to be music.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was, I was an artist for the school when I was in fifth and sixth grade, so probably I enjoyed art, visual art, and music was one of my favorites.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 570152
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) But there's a reason why the music was, um-hm.
Speaker 2: Okay, well, go ahead, yeah.
Speaker 1: Well, this was, this happened about fifth grade, fifth grade [at Southeastern Elementary School, Chesapeake, Virginia].  And Mr. Owens [ph.], another teacher, my music teacher, Mr. Owens--he wasn't my music teacher then.  He was searching for students to be in the band.  And so, he came to the classroom, and he asked the teacher to select some students to be in the band.  And I was raising my hand because I wanted to be in the band, but you know what?  The teacher wouldn't select me.  That's another detrimental moment for me in elementary school: I was not selected by that teacher.  And so, this time, I cried, and I went home.  And my mother [Delma Smith Moore] said to me, "What's wrong, what happened?"  And I said, "Well, I really wanted to be in the band, and teacher wouldn't, wouldn't select me, and Mr. Owens asked the teacher to select some students."  And she said, "You really want to be in the band?"  And I said, "Yes, I do, I really want to be in the band."  So, she went back to school with me the next day, and told the music teacher that I really wanted to be, you know, play an instrument in this band.  And he was thrilled that he had someone that really wanted to do it.  So, he went to the classroom that day and pointed me out and told the teacher, he said, "I want that daughter right there.  She wants to be in the band."  And so, at that point--
Speaker 2: "I want that daughter--," that was the language (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) "That daughter," that was--he--that--right.  He, and he was, and he was like a father to us, to the kids that were part of the band.  And so, from that moment on, Mr. Owens, a music teacher, became another significant teacher in my life.  First, it was Mrs. Paige [ph.], and now it's Mr. Owens because he, he took his time, he took time to come and get me from that classroom.  He asked me, he said, "Well, what do you want to play?"  He said, "Well, why don't we put you on the clarinet?"  I said, "Okay."  So, my dad [Elmo L. Moore, Sr.] got me one of these long silver clarinets, and I played it, played it, and played it, and my--eventually, they got me another kind of clarinet.  But I started playing when I was in the fifth grade, so by the time I was in the seventh grade, I was playing with the high school group because I perfected the instrument.  I really wanted to play.  Then, when I got to high school [Crestwood High School, Chesapeake, Virginia], I played with Norfolk State [Norfolk Branch, Virginia State College; Norfolk State University, Norfolk, Virginia], with the college group.
Speaker 2: So, you were a step ahead?
Speaker 1: I was a step ahead and, and music became my favorite subject.  Then I said that I wanted to go and--graduate from high school, and then I wanted to learn to teach music, like Mr. Owens, 'cause I wanted to one day teach at the same school where he was teaching at that time.  So, that's how music became my favorite thing.  And, art, probably eventually became a subject that I didn't like as well because as I said, I was the artist when I was in ele- in fourth grade, and fifth grade, and sixth grade, and getting good grades, A's in art.  But then, when I got to seventh grade--and my penmanship was very good--when I got to seventh grade, the teacher for some reason gave me a C in art, saying that I couldn't do it.  So, they can make you or break you.  So, then--
Speaker 2: So, that discouraged you from--
Speaker 1: That discouraged me from visual art.  It really did, but I stuck with the music piece of it.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I stuck with the music piece of it.
Story_ID: 570153
Speaker 1: Now, so you went to I guess Chestnut Street until--now did you have middle school, or did you go right to high school?
Speaker 2: No, I went to Chestnut Street School [I.C. Norcom High School, Portsmouth, Virginia].  And then, I went to, when, when the family moved [to Victory Manor, Portsmouth, Virginia], I went to--I think it was called South Elementary School [sic. Southeastern Elementary School], and that's, that was in Chesapeake [Virginia].  And then, I had to ride the school bus to school.  So, I went that--there for the balance of my elementary years.  And then when I went to, when I got to seventh grade and eighth grade, I was at Crestwood High School [Chesapeake, Virginia].  And Crestwood High School had a section for junior high school kids, seventh grade and eighth grade hallway for seventh and eighth grade students, so I was in the building, but I was in the junior high school section.  And then, I went to Crestwood High School for ninth, tenth, eleventh and twelfth grade.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, when you changed grade schools, it didn't affect your music instruction at all, or did it?  I mean--
Speaker 2: Well, actually, I didn't start the music until I got to South high school.
Speaker 1: Okay, so (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I mean, South--South elementary school.
Speaker 1: So the teacher that recruited you to play the clarinet, that was at South?
Speaker 2: At South elementary school.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, okay.  All right now, okay, so then, you went on to Crestwood High School and then--
Speaker 2: For--
Speaker 1: --finished up.
Story_ID: 570154
Speaker 1: Now, were you involved in high school clubs or anything, or did you run for office, student government, or?
Speaker 2: I was involved in the band.  I was involved in the choir.  I was involved in the business club.  I was, I was involved in the home ec club, home economics club.  As far as student body officer, I didn't run for a student body office, but I did run--I was a queen one year and that was my junior year in high school [Crestwood High School, Chesapeake, Virginia].
Speaker 1: Were you the prom queen, or what do they call it?
Speaker 2: No, I was a prom attendant, but I was the, I was the queen for my, for the music department.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, I got to be an attendant for the homecoming queen.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But, so, my, my involvement in high school was more in the music area, and that, that was my buy in because I wanted to be Mr. Owens [ph.].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: So, now did you get a chance to go to all the football games and that sort of thing, to play and?
Speaker 2: Went to all of the football games, played with the band, and all of the football games, went to all of the festivals.  As I said in high school, because I had worked so diligently on this instrument, I was able to play with the college group [at Norfolk Branch, Virginia State College; Norfolk State University, Norfolk, Virginia] in high school, ended up in first chair, starting first chair clarinetist in the eleventh grade, so by the, by the time I got to college [Virginia State College; Virginia State University, Petersburg, Virginia], I was, you know, I was ready to play with the college group as well.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, did you have a particular favorite kind of music that you played or?
Speaker 2: Then, I, I was really into--we did a lot of the marching songs.  We did a lot of the--what was contemporary classical music then for the concerts and for the festivals so--
Speaker 1: Like, what would you consider--I mean--
Speaker 2: Like Beethoven [Ludwig van Beethoven] and Brahms [Johannes Brahms].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  Tchaikovsky [Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky], John Philip Sousa on the, on the, for the band, for the marching pieces.  So, yep, those were, those were the days.
Speaker 1: Now, did you play any, any music by black composers, growing up in high school?
Speaker 2: Not that I recall, not that I recall.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: If I could go back and do it, I would.
Speaker 1: I was wondering.  Now, this is a black high school, right?  I mean, all the high schools, I guess, were black folks--that black folks attended were segregated in Virginia in those days.
Speaker 2: These were, these were segregated schools.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: But, but I--my thinking is, the teachers, although the teachers were black teachers, they were still being taught basically the white history which included white music.  So, I don't think there was a lot of emphasis placed on classical music by people of African descent, you know, it was just music at that time.
Story_ID: 570155
Speaker 1: Did they teach any black history in the school system in those days?
Speaker 2: Nope, no black history when I was growing up, unh-uh.
Speaker 1: Okay.  They never had (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Even in this black high school [Crestwood High School, Chesapeake, Virginia].
Speaker 1: --never had Negro History Week [Black History Month] or?
Speaker 2: Negro history week for us was all the time--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --because we were, you know, we would--there, there were no other kids, there were no other kids of color but black kids at our school that I recall, and definitely no white kids at our school.  We--I didn't realize that there was a major difference between what, what was going on at my school, and what was going on at other schools until I was older.  And then, I realized that our schools were the schools that were always getting the books that were beaten up, you know.  We didn't have the swimming pool.  We didn't know that the other schools did have swimming pools, so we thought it was okay the way, you know, things were going at our school.  When we played, when the football teams played rival teams, they played other black schools in that area.  When we traveled, we traveled to black schools.  When we would do a road trip, it was to black schools.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, you were playing like schools in Hampton Roads [Virginia] or Norfolk [Virginia] or--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --Newport News [Virginia] and--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, so when--are there any other teachers or mentors that come along during this time period?
Speaker 2: Not during this time period.  That was, for elementary school [Chestnut Street School; I.C. Norcom High School, Portsmouth, Virginia], it was Mrs. Paige [ph.], and for, for high school--for, for my upper elementary on through high school, it was Mr. Owens [ph.].  And then, after that, you know, I--when, when I became a teacher, I have a mentor that I can share with you.
Speaker 1: Okay.

Speaker 2: Now that's in Las Vegas [Nevada], right?
Speaker 1: That's in Las Vegas.
Speaker 2: That's in the '70s [1970s].

Speaker 1: Was popular music a big part of growing up, you know, stuff on the radio and Motown [Motown Records] or and that sort of thing (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Popular, popular music, yep, The Supremes, Michael Jackson--was it Michael Jackson?  No, Michael Jackson hadn't quite come out during my younger years, but The Supremes were there.  I remember my dad [Elmo L. Moore, Sr.] listening to a lot of blues.  I remember the 78 records [78 rpm record] that you had to play on the Victrola.  You don't remember that?  That's before your time (laughter).  So, I remember that, and I remember my mother [Delma Smith Moore] playing a lot of Christian music.  She played a lot on Mahalia Jackson when I was growing up.  And my dad played a lot of whatever was the honkytonk blues music during that time.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 570158
Speaker 1: You talked about television, but did you go to the movies much [in Portsmouth, Virginia]?
Speaker 2: Not too much.  We occasionally went to the movie theater, and when we would go to the movie theater, we were not allowed to sit in the downstairs.  We had to sit in the balcony.  There was--you'd go in the movie and then, there was a side door where you would walk upstairs, and you could go to the movie upstairs.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Because downstairs was for white folks.  Upstairs was for colored folks.
Speaker 1: Is that a reason why you didn't go that much, you think?
Speaker 2: Probably didn't go that much because we didn't have the money to go.  We were not a family that had a lot of money.  When--I remember going, but I remember going with my, my grandmother's daughter, my aunt, my dad's sister.  I remember going with her.  It seemed that my [paternal] grandmother [Margaret Trotter Moore] had a little more change than we had in our hou- household.  So, when we would go visit my grandmother, then my Aunt Bobbie [ph.] would take us to the movie, and it was just very rarely that we got to do that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Not, not a lot.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 570159
Speaker 1: Was church a big part of growing up?
Speaker 2: Church was a big part of growing up.  Church, the church that I went to and grew up in, and was baptized in, was Mount Calvary Baptist Church [Portsmouth, Virginia], and that was a church that my grandmother on my dad's side [Margaret Trotter Moore] was a member of.  And so, every Sunday morning, we would wake up.  We would have breakfast, and breakfast consisted of some kind of fish and rolls, probably something else, potatoes.  And then, we would go to Sunday school, and then we would go to eleven o'clock service.  And then, we would go to Baptist Training Union meeting for the children.  And then, we would go to an evening service.  So church was a big deal all day long on a Sunday.  And the way it was, if you didn't go to church--and my mother [Delma Smith Moore] had this rule--if you didn't go to church, you couldn't do anything else on Sunday.  That was it.
Speaker 1: But would you have time to do anything else (laughter)?
Speaker 2: No, we didn't realize that, you know, you really didn't.  Between, between eleven o'clock A.M. service and the, the BTU, there was a little break in there.  So what, we would go out, and we would walk around the neighborhood, you know, or we would, we would walk from my grandmother's house to the pastor's house because the pastor was a favorite person for the youth in the church.  And he invited us, you know, to come to his house and so--
Speaker 1: Now, what was his name and why was he such a favorite?
Speaker 2: His name was, was--all I remember is Reverend Hoard [ph.], Hoard.  I remember that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) H-O--
Speaker 2: --A-R-D.
Speaker 1: --O-A-R-D.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.  And he was a favorite person to, to me, what I can remember because he took time with, with the youth in the church.  Although when he baptized me, because I was crying so hard, he said, "I baptize my brother, George Gray--George Moore," instead of, "my sister, Joyce Moore [HistoryMaker Joyce Moore Gray]."  I remember that, but they got it right on my, on my certificate.  They did get that correct because he couldn't tell who I was 'cause I was all wrapped up, so he didn't know if it was a boy or a girl, and he baptized a young man.
Speaker 1: Now, they wrapped you up in a--
Speaker 2: Well, they put the--
Speaker 1: --linen or something or--
Speaker 2: Well, they put the, they put the white robe on you.  And then, they put, they put a white cloth on your head.  And then, they put a white bathing cla- cap on your head, so you're all covered up, you're all covered up all the way around, and from here all the way down, you were covered up.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now did you, were you baptized in the river or something or in the--
Speaker 2: We were--I was baptized in a pool.  We had a pool at the church that--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --that we were going to at Mount Calvary.  We had a pool there, and so the pool was in the f- it was in the, there were two sections in the church.  And one section was like a big hall, and the other section was the sanctuary.  Well, the pool was in the big hall section under the floor.  So, when it was time for baptisms, they would lift the floor up--we call it raising the floor--and then the pool, they had the pool just beneath that.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.  So, I was baptized in the pool.
Speaker 1: How old were you?
Speaker 2: I was eight years old--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --when I was baptized.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So we, we can forgive him, I guess, for not knowing (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Yeah.
Speaker 1: I guess.  All right.
Story_ID: 570160
Speaker 1: So, when you were a senior in high school [Crestwood High School, Chesapeake, Virginia].
Speaker 2: Senior in high school--
Speaker 1: Yeah, were you determined to be a music teacher at that point?  Had you, had you figured out that's what you wanted to do?
Speaker 2: Yes.  At--when, by the time I was a senior in high school, about ready to graduate, excuse me, I had figured out that, yes, I wanted to be a music teacher.  And I had shared that with Mr. Owens [ph.], and Mr. Owens had actually worked with me to get me some money to go to school.  I had some scholarships that he, he was able to get me, and then some, some student loans, and then, that was through Mr. Owens.  And then, my mother's [Delma Smith Moore]--she had a little neighborhood club.  It was like a flower club, and they came together, and they also gave me a scholarship, some scholarship money to go to school.  But I was determined that I wanted to be a music teacher, just like Mr. Owens.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so, I, I went to school to become a music teacher.
Story_ID: 570161
Speaker 1: Was it difficult to choose Virginia State [Virginia State College; Virginia State University, Petersburg, Virginia], or did it--was that the only, I mean, the best option, I guess?
Speaker 2: I think Virginia State, because I was able to get some money from Virginia State, some scholarship money from Virginia State.  The other option would have been Norfolk State [Norfolk Branch, Virginia State College; Norfolk State University, Norfolk, Virginia].  Norfolk State wasn't, didn't have a live on campus at that time.  And I did say to my, my mother [Delma Smith Moore] and my father [Elmo L. Moore, Sr.] that I really wanted to live on a campus, and they thought it was a good idea, too.  And Virginia State did, you know, working with Mr. Owens [ph.], Mr. Owens was able to get me some money to go to Virginia State in Petersburg [Virginia].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, now you graduated in high school in what year?
Speaker 2: I graduated from high school in 1961.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Crestwood High School [Chesapeake, Virginia].
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, you entered Virginia State I guess, the fall of '61 [1961]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I entered the fall of '61 [1961].
Speaker 1: Now, how did you like it?
Speaker 2: You know, it was a good experience my, my first year.  But, by the end of the year, I just was, as if I had had too much school.  And I said to my mother that I didn't want to go back at that point, not right then, and I wanted to go back another time.  And she just, in her quiet way, she said, you know, "You go on and stay in school, and get that education," she said, "because that's something no one can ever take away from you."
Speaker 1: Now, now what happened that you would be tired of school in your freshman year?  Now, this is supposed to be the most exciting part of school.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You go away from home for the first time.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: You're on this exciting new campus, you know, in another town.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And you were tired of it?
Speaker 2: I was tired of it.  At the end of my first year, I thought, I don't want to do this right now. I want to go out--.  I think another reason I was tired--I didn't have a lot of money.  I had a little scholarship money, but I really didn't have money to buy clothes, and to buy the other things that I saw other kids with.  And so, I thought maybe I needed to leave there, leave school, and go get a job, and earn a little extra money, and then go back to school.  And so, and school, for me my first year was tough, it was hard.  And I think a lot of kids probably experienced that, you know, leaving high school where you did fairly well.  And then, you go to college, and you're independent because I was living on campus.  I was independent, and then having to study even harder, but not making As like I wanted to.  I was getting a little discouraged with myself.  And my mother, you know, she just, she encouraged me to do this.  She said, "You can take care--you'll earn a living.  You'll be able to take care of yourself and your children if something ever--if you ever get married, and something happens to your husband, you'll be able to take care of yourself and your children."  She said that education is something no one can take from you.  And, evidently, that must have stuck with me.
Story_ID: 570162
Speaker 1: Then, another thing that happened with me during, even during my first year of college [Virginia State College; Virginia State University, Petersburg, Virginia].  I had--the head of our music department was Dr. Gatlin [F. Nathaniel Gatlin], and we called him Pops.  And so, Pops became a significant figure in my life, too, because I think these people began seeing things in me that I didn't see in myself.  He was a clarinetist and, and my major instrument was the clarinet as well.  And so, I had to go to him for my instructions, my private instructions on my instrument.  And also during my first year, I had, I got sick, and so, I had to go home for--I think, a month or two, something like that.  And I kind of missed out on my music part, but he s- he, he sought me out.  He called my mother [Delma Smith Moore], and he said, "I know she's been under the weather, but we'd really like--," spring was coming along.  He said, "I'd really like to have her come back and participate in the spring concert and go on tour with us."  And so, he--she, my mom said, "Well, we don't have any money for her to come right now."  And, and Pops said, "That's okay, she can come back, and she can stay with my family and me.  She can stay with us until she gets on this trip, and gets back on her feet, and back in school."  So, I, you know, I kind of had that stuff to live through.  But, but because of Dr. Gatlin--Pops is what we called him--I think that was another force that said, you can do this, you got to do it, and, you know, just pick up the pieces, and keep going, so I did.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: That put me a little behind in school, but I was still able to go on and, and do what I needed to do.  At that point after that, in my freshman year, I went home for a short period of time, then I went back to school for the summer, and the tuition was taken care of for the summer 'cause I had, you know, grant money and I had, still had some scholarship, so I was able to make it through the summer.  And then I just started working on campus.  And when I started working different jobs on campus that brought me in a little extra money to help with extra things on campus.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So, you didn't feel so bad about having, not having (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I didn't feel so bad about that.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: All right.
Story_ID: 570163
Speaker 1: When did you join AKA [Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority]?  Was that when you were in school or?
Speaker 2: No, when I was in school, my focus was on getting through school and, again, that was another issue with money, which I didn't have.  I did, I did go to a rush that the AKA had, AKAs had, and I knew that if I ever did join a sorority, that it would be AKA.  It wouldn't be one of the other sororities.  And so, I didn't join when I was on campus.  Number one, I didn't feel I had the time, and number two, I definitely didn't have the money to do it.  So, I joined the graduate chapter after I had finished school.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, so you weren't involved in AKA at Virginia State [Virginia State College; Virginia State University, Petersburg, Virginia] now as such, you know?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Who was the president then of Virginia State then?
Speaker 2: Who was then?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I don't remember [Robert Prentiss Daniel] (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, you don't have to, but I just thought I'd ask to see if you knew.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I mean, to see if, you know, there are any--
Speaker 2: I'm trying to think.  I remember my high school principal [at Crestwood High School, Chesapeake, Virginia], but the president of the college, I don't recall.
Speaker 1: He didn't really play any significant--
Speaker 2: Unh-uh.
Speaker 1: --you know, role down at the student level, I guess.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Well--
Speaker 2: My involvement in college was, again, still in music, in the music area.  I was involved in all of the bands, the--any band that they had, I was a part of, and learned how to play several different instruments.  And I was also involved in the choir as well.  The band, the orchestra, and the choirs--the bands, the orchestra, and the choirs at Virginia State, those were my extracurricular activities.
Story_ID: 570164
Speaker 1: Now, this is like the height of the Civil Rights Movement on the campuses, and they were doing the Freedom Rides at--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --in Nashville [Tennessee] and--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --sitting in in Greensboro [North Carolina].  And did the Civil Rights Movement come to Virginia State's campus [Virginia State College; Virginia State University, Petersburg, Virginia] and--
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, what we did, we did sit-ins in Petersburg, Virginia that was organized by student government and student--members of the student body were in groups, and we went down.  Some stayed outside and did the picketing.  And then some went inside of this particular restaurant, and I don't remember the name of it, and sat at the counter.  So, we actually did do, do sit-ins during that time.
Speaker 1: Now, what happened?  I mean, did they just give in immediately, or did they have you all arrested or what did, what happened?
Speaker 2: Well, we didn't get arrested.  (Laughter) I didn't get arrested.  Eventually, we did this for several months, it seemed, if I recall correctly, we did it for several months.  And then, eventually, the restaurant became a restaurant that was opened to everyone.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, eventually--
Speaker 2: Now, it wasn't just that restaurant.  It was also the movie theater, and it was also other restaurants in that area, the stores because there were some stores in Petersburg that blacks were not allowed to go in.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, ultimately--
Speaker 2: And it--
Speaker 1: --the sit-ins resulted in victory for--
Speaker 2: Right.  And then, something else happened when I was at Virginia State traveling back and forth from Portsmouth [Virginia] to, to Petersburg.  I would have to ride the Greyhound bus.  And so, when I got on the bus, it was still during that time when I, you had to sit on, in a certain part of the bus, so I would go to my seat on the bus.  And then, I can remember riding on the bus, and the bus stopping at these little towns where you get off the bus, and you can--bus, and you can go to the restroom, or go in and have food or whatever.  But blacks, again, or coloreds, were not allowed to drink out of certain water fountains.  We had a water fountain.  When you got off the bus, there would be two water fountains: one that was really dirty, and the other one was very clean.  The one that was very dirty would have "Colored Only" written over it.  The one that was very clean would have "White" for whites only written over it, or a sign posted over it.  The--there were restaurants.  There was a side for whites.  There was around the back for people of color, or coloreds is what they said.  The front side, the bus would park on the front side.  The glass windows, crystal clear, you could see in, and that's where the whites would go in.  They would go in and sit down and eat.  The blacks would have to go around the back, the windows totally--I can remember this--I mean, you couldn't even see in the windows.  They were so greasy and dirty.  Also, the restrooms, there were separate restrooms, or bathrooms or toilets.  And there was a white only, and there was one for the coloreds.  The, the one for the coloreds, filthy.  I don't know what the ones for the whites, but you can imagine it was probably clean.  So, I didn't know it then, but those were the Jim Crow days.  I was growing up in that, and a part of that.
Speaker 1: So, to you, it's just a normal everyday--
Speaker 2: It was normal, it was normal, but something in me was saying, this is not right.  And I really didn't go in the--I didn't go to the bathrooms after I saw it the first time.  I didn't go to the restaurants to eat.  I said I don't want to do that.  That's something not right about this.  And I did that until I was a senior in college, and then I didn't do it any longer.  And somewhere between that time, things began, during that time--it was probably about the time that we were doing the sit-ins when things were changing all along the line.
Speaker 1: So, was, is there a particular story about the Greyhound bus that you were going, you were going to tell us something happened?
Speaker 2: That's what I, that was my story--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --about the Greyhound bus, just remembering, you know, what it was like, going to the, riding the Greyhound bus, having to sit in a certain section with the, with the water fountains, and the restrooms or the toilets, and then the, the restaurants, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 570165
Speaker 1: So, now with all the sit-ins [in Petersburg, Virginia] and so forth, nobody got hurt or anything or was arrested or?
Speaker 2: The sit-ins, there, there were a group of students that were arrested.  I wasn't a part of that--the students that were arrested.  But there, I can remember that there were some kids that were, some students from the college [Virginia State College; Virginia State University, Petersburg, Virginia] that were arrested and taken to jail.
Speaker 1: Was there a general feeling of a movement in those days, you know, when you were in college, that, you know, and we look back on it, it's all the Civil Rights Movement days--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and--especially on the campuses.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Did you all feel, you kind of feel that you were a part of a movement there?
Speaker 2: I think that feeling came about probably when I was in high school [Crestwood High School, Chesapeake, Virginia].  And it stayed with me, you know, even when I was in college 'cause when I was in high school was when the, the Little Rock Nine, when the desegregation started, you know, taking place in the South.  And I can remember there were a select group of students from a high school that went from our high school to the white high school on the other side of town.  And so, these kids would have to get on the bus--at our school, they would come to our school, then they had to get on a separate bus, and then ride that bus over to the, to the white school.
Speaker 1: So, that was--
Speaker 2: That was in (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) that was an integration experiment there?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that was in the late '50s [1950s], maybe fifty--'58 [1958], or '59 [1959], '60 [1960], somewhere in there.
Speaker 1: Now, do you remember ever hearing of Vernon Johns, Reverend Vernon Johns?
Speaker 2: Vernon Johns?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I think he lived, I think his daughter [Barbara Johns] was one of the early people to integrate one of those Virginia, Tidewater schools.  I'm not, I don't think, I don't know if it's, I don't think it's Portsmouth [Virginia], but it was around there.  Vernon Johns was the pastor that preceded Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] in Birm- at Montgomery [Dexter Avenue Baptist Church; Dexter Avenue King Memorial Baptist Church, Montgomery, Alabama].
Speaker 2: Was he in Southampton, Virginia [Southampton County, Virginia] maybe?
Speaker 1: Southampton, I don't think it was Southampton.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Was he on the Maryland side of Virginia?
Speaker 1: Oh, I don't--
Speaker 2: You don't know, okay.
Speaker 1: I'm--now--
Speaker 2: Now, that one--
Speaker 1: --it's getting kind of fuzzy, but I know it was around in that Tidewater area that his daughter actually integrated one of those schools.  It's part of a group that did it, but there's been like a TV film made about Vernon Johns' life ['The Vernon Johns Story: The Road to Freedom']--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --I think, too, you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: He was a great orator.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But, at any rate, but, so you all were--the Montgomery Bus Boycott had already taken place.
Speaker 2: It had.
Speaker 1: The sit-ins are going on and--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The sit-ins are going on.  And the strange thing, '56 [1956] was the Rosa Parks sit- bus ride and sit-in, but even in '61 [1961], in '60 [1960]--let's see--'59 [1959] and '60 [1960], the buses were still de- not segregated--desegregated--were segregated in Portsmouth, even '58 [1958], '59 [1959].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: But did they eventually--
Speaker 2: They eventually, right.
Speaker 1: --integrated them?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: While you were in college?
Speaker 2: While I was in college.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Right.
Story_ID: 570166
Speaker 1: Were there any students or teachers that we would, that you think are worthy of talking about who were at Norfolk State then besides your music teacher?
Speaker 2: At Virginia State [Virginia State College; Virginia State University] in Petersburg [Virginia] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) At Virginia State, I'm sorry, yeah, at Petersburg, yeah.
Speaker 2: That Mr. Owens [ph.]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Mr. Owens was my music teacher in high school [Crestwood High School, Chesapeake, Virginia], and then, Dr. Gatlin [F. Nathaniel Gatlin] in college.
Speaker 1: Pops Gatlin, yeah, right, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Pops Gatlin, right, in college.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But nobody--any other teachers or anything that made an impression or that, you know?
Speaker 2: Unh-uh.  No.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So, so you're taking music education courses, right, basically?
Speaker 2: Right, I had to do my basics, you know, you have to get those out of the way, and then, lots of music classes, um-hm--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --to become a music teacher.
Speaker 1: Now, to become a music teacher, you have to master a number of different instruments, right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So, how many did you have to learn how to play and--
Speaker 2: Well, you have to, you have to learn to play your woodwinds and you have to learn to play your brass winds.  And then, you have your percussion 'cause I did band.  I also did the orchestra instruments, so I did the violin, the viola, the cello, and the bass.  Now, in terms of being proficient on all of those, I didn't be- I wasn't proficient.  But I knew how to, how to play each of them, and I knew how to teach people to play each of them.  The--I was proficient on the clarinet and all the woodwind instruments, but then I learned to play the brass wind instruments as well, starting with the trumpet, and the French horn, and the baritone horn, I learned to play those, and the tuba.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Now, did you, would, did the clarinet continue to be your favorite one?
Speaker 2: It was because that was the one I started on, yeah.  That's the one I did my recital on, you know, that was my major instrument, the clarinet.  And I probably would still be playing it today, except I gave it to a niece that went to college, and haven't seen it since (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.  This is the same metal clarinet that you--?
Speaker 2: No, 'cause my dad [Elmo L. Moore, Sr.]--when I, when I--he saw that I was interested in it, then he bought me a clarinet, a regular one, the, the wooden clarinet, you know, the pieces.  He bought me one of those, and then when I went to college, he knew that I was really serious.  That's when I got my newest clarinet, the one that I loaned to my niece that--and never to see it again.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you grad- when you were graduating from college, now this will be in '65 [1965], I guess?
Speaker 2: I graduated in '66 [1966]--
Speaker 1: Sixty-six [1966], okay, okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) because I got a little behind that year I was not doing too well.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 570167
Speaker 1: Nineteen sixty-six [1966].  Now what were your prospects?  Were you going to teach in the local schools or what?
Speaker 2: Well, what I, what I had planned to do was to actually go back to the Tidewater area [Virginia] and, eventually, you know, do some jobs in that area, and eventually teach at Crestwood High School [Chesapeake, Virginia] 'cause I wanted to replace Mr. Owens [ph.] when he retired, but I didn't.  During my senior year [at Virginia State College; Virginia State University, Petersburg, Virginia], I had, I had several telephone interviews just before I graduated, just before I got my degree.  And one was from a town in Virginia, a small town that I had never heard of.  One was in Ypsilanti, Michigan, and the other one was Las Vegas, Nevada.  And so, I said to my dad [Elmo L. Moore, Sr.], I said, "I want to go to the one that's furthest away, and I'll be back in a year."  And he said, "That's--," at home, we say (pronunciation) Nevada.  He said, "That's Nevada, and you won't be back in a year."  And he was right, so I took the offer in Las Vegas, and then I went, you know, went to Las Vegas to teach.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, so it was a teaching--
Speaker 2: It was a teaching--
Speaker 1: --of- okay.
Speaker 2: It was a teaching position.
Speaker 1: All right, okay.
Speaker 2: Right, and it was teaching band.  It was actually teaching music at an elementary school.  And they hadn't, never had a music program, so I had the task of putting together the full music program, so I did the, I did K through 6th [kindergarten to sixth grade] music at Jo Mackey Elementary School [Jo Mackey Academy of Leadership and Global Communication].
Speaker 1: Okay, it's Jo Mackey--
Speaker 2: Jo Mackey, M-A-C-K-E-Y.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, is this like an all-black school?
Speaker 2: It's an all-black school--
Speaker 1: In Las Vegas [North Las Vegas, Nevada], okay.
Speaker 2: --with some white teachers, right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: This was before--
Speaker 1: Now, what was--
Speaker 2: --integration.
Speaker 1: What do they call the black section in Las Vegas [Nevada] in those days?  They--
Speaker 2: West, West Las Vegas.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It's in West Las Vegas.
Speaker 1: Yeah, 'cause I've heard--
Speaker 2: And there were, there were six, six elementary schools, and Jo Mackey was one of them for the--they were neighborhood schools, so Jo Mackey was a neighborhood school.  So, my job was to set up the full music program in that school--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --which I did.
Speaker 1: Now, that seems like it would be a--you'd have a lot of interested students in Las Vegas from what I understand.  Now correct me if I'm wrong, but a lot, in those days, all the black entertainers, you know, had to stay, they stayed in West Las Vegas.  They came to town and they were, a lot of music around--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --that part of Las Vegas.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And I would imagine that would interest a lot of people in wanting to study music, and become a musician.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I think that probably did happen because people saw an opportunity, you know, for them, to, if they, if they played an instrument, or they got involved in music, they saw an opportunity to do other things right within that city.  So, yeah, it was.  It was of interest.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 570168
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, give us a kind of an idea of what black Las Vegas [Nevada] was like when you got out there in 1966.
Speaker 2: For, for me, it was, it was a great experience being at Jo Mackey Elementary School [Jo Mackey Academy of Leadership and Global Communication, North Las Vegas, Nevada] in that neighborhood.  The, the school was, it was like a, it was like a family center for families and for people that worked at the school.  And as I said, what I had to do was set up the full music program, so I designed a full music program, vocal and instrumental, for the school.  For the, for the lower grades, I had them involved in choirs, and taught all of the classes.  For the fourth grade, I had every fourth grade student playing the flutophone, so we had a flutophone band.  And then, for fifth and sixth grade, we had a fifth and sixth grade choir, and then we had a fifth and sixth grade band program.
Speaker 1: Now, the flutophone, that was like the re- is that the recorder?
Speaker 2: A recorder, it's the recorder.
Speaker 1: The recorder, yeah, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, flutophone recorder.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: I can remember parents were very supportive.  We had the entire school involved in, in what they call the Helldorado [Helldorado Days] parade.  That's, that's the Nevada Day in Las Vegas, so every year that was one of the major events that the entire school participated in.  And the, the Jo Mackey community came forward to help with that 'cause we would have to go out, we would have to take the students out on the street to practice what we were going to do for the parade.  And parents would come out in support.  I mean, very, very supportive parents.  But I--let's see, I think it was about my third or fourth year at Jo Mackey School, they decided in that area that they needed to desegregate the schools in the--in that area.  And so, remember I said there were six elementary schools that were neighborhood schools, K through 6th [kindergarten to sixth grade] for the kids that lived in that neighborhood.
Speaker 1: So, this is about 1970, 1969 or '70 [1970]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, this is 1966, '67 [1967], '68 [1968], you know, somewhere in there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so, what they did was they created, the school district [Clark County School District] created a program called the POSE program, Program of Social Enrichment.  And what they did was they bused kindergarten students--what was it--they bused out the kindergarten students up to--they bused out certain grades of students to go to white schools in other areas.  And kindergarten, I remember, 'cause we thought they were too young to have to leave.  And then, they started bringing in kids from, a few kids from the upper grades to call--to desegregate the schools.  And, at that point, I was moved from Jo Mackey.  And then, I began teaching at several different elementary schools, which included Manch Elementary [Jacob E. Manch Elementary School], it's a military school in Nellis [Las Vegas, Nevada].  I also stayed at Jo Mackey, and then one other elementary school, I believe it was Booker [Kermit R. Booker, Sr. Elementary School; Kermit R. Booker, Sr. Innovative Elementary School, Las Vegas, Nevada].
Speaker 1: Now, before we leave Jo Mackey, who, do you have any idea who Jo Mackey was?  He's probably somebody in the community, I would guess.  I don't know.
Speaker 2: I don't, but I do know this.  The principal at the, at that time, was another influential person in my life was H.P. Fitzgerald.  And H.P. Fitzgerald was the one that recruited me to teach at Jo Mackey.  He was the principal, and he now has a school named after him [H.P. Fitzgerald Elementary School, North Las Vegas, Nevada].  He's deceased, but he does have a school there named after him.  What I remember vaguely about Jo Mackey is that it was named after a person that was like a rancher or cowboy in that area, and it wasn't a black person, it was a white person.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, the neighborhood became black at one time, I guess, after they--
Speaker 2: They--the school was put there by the school district in the neighborhood and the neighborhood was already black.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and there was, there were six elementary schools in six different areas because all of West Las Vegas [Las Vegas, Nevada] was basically black.  I mean, it's probably changing some, but that section is still basically the same where, where you have Jo Mackey and Kit Carson [Kit Carson Elementary School; Kit Carson International Academy, Las Vegas, Nevada].  See, Kit Carson was another one that's a white person, but it was a school in that area.  Okay?
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Booker, Booker Elementary was named after a black man [Kermit R. Booker, Sr.].  And that's the only one I can remember that was in that area that's named after a black person.
Speaker 1: Now, when did you start attending the University of Nevada in Las Vegas, UNLV [University of Nevada, Las Vegas, Las Vegas, Nevada]?
Speaker 2: UNLV, I started that, let's see, see, probably about 1973, '73 [1973], '74 [1974] 'cause I completed my master's [degree] in '75 [1975] at UNLV.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And by then, I had, I also taught at junior high schools, and I co-taught at some of the high schools in Las Vegas as well.  So, by the time I got my master's I had, had a K-12 [kindergarten to twelfth grade] experience working at the elementary, the middle, the junior high, and the high school--
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) as a teacher.
Story_ID: 570169
Speaker 1: Did you meet any of the music stars in Las Vegas [Nevada]?
Speaker 2: I probably did, people coming through town, yeah.  Now and then we'd go out and see some people out, you know, coming into town on the Strip [Las Vegas Strip, Las Vegas, Nevada].  Or they would come over--there was a, there's a place on Bonanza [Road] that was a favorite spot for them to come [Moulin Rouge Hotel, Las Vegas, Nevada], so sometimes we'd get to meet different people that way.  Jimmy Smith, I remember Jimmy Smith.  I'm trying to think--that's all I can think of right now.
Speaker 1: Was [HistoryMaker] Nancy Wilson out there?
Speaker 2: Nancy Wilson, yeah, Nancy Wilson came.
Speaker 1: Dinah Washington, I guess or (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I didn't meet her personally--
Speaker 1: Huh?
Speaker 2: I didn't meet her personally, but she came, yeah.  Dinah Washington, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Yes.  I know Sammy Davis, Jr. was out, seemed to be out there.
Speaker 2: Sammy Davis, Jr., a lot, he was there a lot.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But did they come over to the Westside [Las Vegas, Nevada] and--?
Speaker 2: They would come over to the Westside or, occasionally, they might be out on the Strip.  We could go out there and see them on the Strip.  But most of the time, they came over to the Westside to that--it's a place on Bonanza, that was, you know, mainly for them that they would come to, and I can't think of the name of it now.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I know there's a fa- it's been written about as a place where, where--there's a black club, right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Where people, black entertainers would come and perform for the black community--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --who were--.  Now, was the black community basically banned from the Las Vegas clubs, you know?  When you were there, or had they started integrating?
Speaker 2: I don't, I don't think blacks were banned from--
Speaker 1: I know they were at one, one point.  That's why they had to entertain them on the Westside 'cause they couldn't do it, you know.
Speaker 2: Well, you know, and that's probably what was still going on without me knowing it.  I just know that I was in a situation where I was in the black neighborhood, I was a black, so I was able to go to these, to this club, and to see these people, and we did.  But you're probably right.  That's when they were actually banned from performing in other areas, other than what they came there exactly to do, like Sammy Davis, Jr., to perform at the Sahara Hotel [Sahara Hotel and Casino; SLS Las Vegas, Las Vegas, Nevada], and that's it.  But then, he spent time over with his own people at this, you know, jazz place on the Westside.
Story_ID: 570170
Speaker 1: You earned your M.A. in 1975.  Are there any stories about the University of Nevada, Las Vegas [Las Vegas, Nevada], that you have (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.  Yeah, I can remember--you see, keep in mind that until I got to Las Vegas [Nevada], integration was not a part of my life.  Basically, I went to elementary and high school, or junior high and high school [Crestwood High School, Chesapeake, Virginia], black schools.  Virginia State [Virginia State College; Virginia State University, Petersburg, Virginia], a black school [HBCU].  When I get, get to Nevada as a teacher, I'm still teaching black kids, a few white teachers on, in that school, but still mainly the black population.  Then, I start working at these elementary schools that have some white students, but these are children.  When I got to college, enrolled in college, and I, I was sitting in one of my classes one day and looked around, and I'm the only black seated there.  And the teacher turns out to be a racist.  The teacher started, started lecturing that way about blacks being insignificant, not being important figures.  The teacher started showing derogatory material in class and so--
Speaker 1: Like, well, be specific.  Can you remember any--any specific thing that--
Speaker 2: That he said?
Speaker 1: Yeah, or showed you--
Speaker 2: Or he showed?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: The materials that he showed were probably, you know--I took offense to them because they were, that he would show scenes of black people in the South, very poor, laborers on these farms.  This is the only kind of work that they can do, you know, this is the only kind of life that they can live.  And I just took offense to it and so, I did, I went to the professor.  I went to this, this person, and I told him that I was deeply offended by that.  And he explained to me in his terms that it was part of this sociology and his history of what he was doing in that class.  And I said, "There's another way that you can do it without, you know, putting, putting people of color, putting Negroes down, like you're doing."  And I said,  "I would hope that you would change--," I can't remember exactly the conversation but, "I would hope that you would change what you're doing in this class, not only because I'm here, but because you'll have other students coming along as well.  And up until this point, you've probably not had a black student in your class."  And he said, "Well, no, as a matter of fact, I haven't."  And I said, "One other thing, I want you to know that I'm not going to accept a poor grade out of this class; I'm going to accept the grade that I know I have earned in this class."
Speaker 1: What did he teach?  What was it?
Speaker 2: What did he say?
Speaker 1: What did he teach?  What class was it?
Speaker 2: It was, it was a history class and I can't remember exactly, you know, what it was, but it was something about history.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now, I was thinking it was music at first (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, it wasn't music.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know, I got my master's degree in curriculum and instruction, secondary level, so I kind of shifted away thinking and knowing that one day, I wanted to do what Mr. Fitzgerald [H.P. Fitzgerald] had done: become a school principal.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, I knew I had to kind of shift my role in terms of music and branch out a little bit.  And I had the teaching experience, so now, I wanted to, to work in another area, and one day become a school principal.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's what I wanted.
Speaker 1: Now, did you know any of the athletes on--there were some black athletes there in those days playing basketball, not, they may have been doing other things, too, but I know, I think Ricky Sobers, and Reggie Theus.  I don't know--were they--did you--?
Speaker 2: They weren't important to me (laughter)--
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: --during that time.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, so you earn your M.A. in 1975.  Now, so this qualified you to become a school administrator on some level, right?
Speaker 2: No, it didn't.
Speaker 1: It didn't, okay.
Speaker 2: I got my master's in curriculum instruction--curriculum and instruction, secondary level.  And then, what I did was, because I wanted to be eventually one day, become a principal, not, not knowing when it would happen.  I went back to school, took some additional hours, and got certified in school administration.  So, my degree was in--master's was in curriculum and instruction, and then my--I received certification in administration.
Story_ID: 570171
Speaker 1: So, I know at by 1980, you moved to Salt Lake City [Utah] now to--
Speaker 2: Nineteen eighty [1980]--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --moved to Salt Lake City.
Speaker 1: And was that to become a principal or?
Speaker 2: No, the reason I moved, Lloyd [Lloyd Gray] and I got married and he lived here.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so, what I did was I left Clark County School District and moved here.  And when I came, I didn't have a job at all, but I just took (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, tell us how you met Lloyd before we (laughter)--
Speaker 2: Oh, you want to know how I met Lloyd?  Well, Lloyd is, Lloyd's brother lives in, in Las Vegas [Nevada].  And Lloyd's brother was tight friends with my dear friend, a very good friend of mine, Inez [ph.].  And this particular day, Lloyd was visiting his brother.  He also came over to Inez's where I was visiting Inez.  And he walked in with his brother, Myron [ph.], and I said to my friend, I said, "Who is that?"  And she said, "That's Myron's brother."  And I said, "Wow, is he married?"  And she said, "Ah, I don't think so, or if he is, he's divorced or getting divorced or something."  I said, "Mm, I need to go and meet him."  So, they had walked to her den, her little family room.  So, I went back and I said, "Hi, I'm Joyce [HistoryMaker Joyce Moore Gray]."  And he says, "Hi, I'm Lloyd."  And the rest is history.  So, that's how I (laughter)--
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Okay.
Speaker 2: --that's how I met Lloyd.
Speaker 1: All it took was keen observation, huh?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Okay.
Speaker 2: So, that's how I met Lloyd.  And then, we just, you know, started hanging out, and he still lived in Salt Lake, so he would come and visit me in Las Vegas.  And, occasionally, I would come and see him in, in Salt Lake, and then we said, well, this is kind of crazy.
Speaker 1: How far away is it?
Speaker 2: It's about 499 miles that he had to travel.  And then, on one of my trips here, he proposed and I said, "Do you really think we need to do that?"  And he says, "Yes," so then, we got engaged.  And then shortly after that, maybe about five years after that, we were married.  So, we dated for about five years--off and on for about five years.
Speaker 1: That's a long way to go off and on for five years, yeah, 499 miles.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Highway love, 499, well, five hundred miles.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: Right.
Story_ID: 570172
Speaker 1: So, when you came here in 1980, how--well, how did you find Salt Lake City [Utah]?  Did you like it as well as Las Vegas [Nevada] or?
Speaker 2: When I first got here, I didn't like it because all of my friends were in Las Vegas and, you know, I had to start, basically, a whole new extended family because I didn't have family here.  I had Lloyd's people that were here--his mother and father were here, but and Lloyd [Gray's husband, Lloyd Gray] was here, but basically that was it.  So, I didn't like it as well, but I knew that I would be here for a while so I just, you know, I just took it in and said, I got to do what I got to do.  And the first thing I wanted to do was find a job.  So, I put reserva- resumes and applications out in districts that were close to where we were living at that time.  We were living over in West Valley [West Valley City, Utah], and I put out applications, and there were about five or six different districts.  And, and I finally received a call from a principal of a junior high school in Granite School District, West Lake Junior High School [West Valley City, Utah].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I--he invited me to have an interview with him, and I did.  The interview lasted for about two hours, but it ended up that I did get the job.  So, that's how I started my teaching right here in, in this area--
Speaker 1: Now, is this--
Speaker 2: West Lake Junior High.
Speaker 1: Is this at an integrated school or?
Speaker 2: Yes, it is.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, this is the first one.
Speaker 2: Yes.  This is the first one.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No, this is not the first integrated school where I've taught.  Remember, I left--when Jo Mackey [Jo Mackey Elementary School; Jo Mackey Academy of Leadership and Global Communication, North Las Vegas, Nevada] was infused into that POSE, Program of Social Enrichment, for the purpose of desegregating the schools, then I, I started going to schools that were mixed.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Remember Manch [Jacob E. Manch Elementary School], which is a military school in Nellis [Las Vegas, Nevada], a military school.
Speaker 1: That was, that was like--
Speaker 2: Those were elementary schools.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then I also taught, I taught at several junior high schools that had mixed populations.  So, once they went in, and they desegregated those schools, they've never gone back to having all neighborhood African American schools or black schools in Las Vegas.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: But here in Salt Lake City, this was an integrated school, West Lake Junior High School?
Speaker 2: It was an integrated school--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --right, predominantly white.
Speaker 1: Now, were you their first black teacher?
Speaker 2: Hm, you know, I'm not sure about that.  I've never had that to come up before.  I could very well have been the first black teacher at that school.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You don't remember another one there at the--
Speaker 2: There wasn't another one while I was there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No, there wasn't another black teacher.
Speaker 1: You definitely were the only there when you--
Speaker 2: I was the only one there when I was there, right.
Speaker 1: Now, is that a difficult situation to be in?
Speaker 2: As the only--?  You know, it is, but it isn't because, for me, I started focusing on what I needed to do.  And I was hired to be the teacher at that school.  The majority of the students that I taught were white.  People on the faculty were white.  They were not--they were not rude or abusive to me when I was teaching, so that didn't, you know, the issue of race didn't become a problem.  It did later on, but not at this particular time in my life.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, you were treated fairly well there in--
Speaker 2: At West Lake, yes, I was (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, all right.  So, how long were you at West Lake?
Speaker 2: Just for a year.
Story_ID: 570173
Speaker 1: And then at the end of that year [at West Lake Junior High School, West Valley City, Utah], there was an opening at the Granite School District office.  It was in the multicultural center and it was for the multi- multicultural coordinator for the school district.  And so, I applied for that job and I got that one.  So, I went to work in the center and I did that for two years.  And towards the end of my second year--or the second semester of my second year, I was asked to go out and to be an interim assistant at a junior high school in that same district.  So, so, when I came here, I had my administrative certification already.  So, I was asked to go if--Ted Peterson asked me to go in to the school that I went in to be the interim assistant principal at that school.
Speaker 2: So, this is in '82 [1982]?
Speaker 1: Hm, must have been in '82 [1982].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: No, '83 [1983].
Speaker 2: Eighty-three [1983], okay.  So, you were interim assistant principal.
Speaker 1: Nineteen eighty-three [1983] throughout the rest of that year.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So, I know in eight- '84 [1984], you were hired as principal of Arcadia [Arcadia Elementary School, Salt Lake City, Utah]?
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Right.  Okay.
Speaker 1: Right.  At one point, I was working, I was the coordinator still at the district office.  I was also working as an assistant principal at the junior high school, and then towards the end of that year, I applied for a principalship.  And so, by the next year, I was principal of Arcadia Elementary School--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Eighty-four [1984].
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: In 1984.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So, were you the first--well, you probably were the first black principal, I guess of--?
Speaker 1: The--I was the first black principal of that school, the first black principal in the State of Utah--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --in the state, in 1984.
Story_ID: 570174
Speaker 1: Now here's where the story starts.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Okay.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: Go ahead (laughter).
Speaker 1: Well, in this situation, now that I'm the person that's in charge of the school [Arcadia Elementary School, Salt Lake City, Utah], it's a little bit different than being a teacher.  So, I mean, the race--racists began to surface in the community and at the school, from the teachers, from the students, and from the parents.  And it was, it was difficult that first year because, first of all, parents were looking at me and saying, "Is she qualified to be at the school?  Does she really have the credentials?  We want to see her creden- ."  They actually said this to my assistant superintendent: "We want to see her credentials."  And then, there were a group of parents that were very, very racist.  Some of them pulled their kids out of the school, went to other schools, but yet they still had--they were noisy enough to create havoc in the school that I was in.  There were students that actually called me a nigger.  There were parents that actually called me nigger.  And it was, it was not a happy time.  I was at that school for six years, and it probably took three good years to really, you know, get myself situated in that school.
Speaker 2: How did you handle, you know, that, the name calling and that sort of thing?
Speaker 1: I think I handled it--I had a, I had a secretary, a white lady was my secretary, but very supportive of me and she was always there for me.  I had, I had people at my church [New Pilgrim Baptist Church, Salt Lake City, Utah], and I had Lloyd [Gray's husband, Lloyd Gray] that I would talk to.  The way I handled it, I knew that I had to do a good job, and I knew I had to always do what was best for the children.  And so, what I would do is I would put my focus on doing what was best for the kids.  Because parents wanted to come after me, and say that I wasn't doing what was best for the kids, you know, that I was misusing funds, that I was assigning students to the wrong teachers or just--.  But I knew, and so I just kept focusing on what I knew was right.  But the other--I think the strongest thing that came out that my first or second year, was the fact that it was, this was a small group, the racist group, the people that were basically trying to get me out of the school.  They, they had gone to the school board and everything, but there was a silent majority out there that really supported what I was doing.  And what they did was they came together, and they put together a manual of support letters that were given to the board of education saying that they wanted me in the school and that, you know, they didn't represent the minority; they represented the large majority.  And that was probably my salvation in terms of--.  And it turned out to be a good situation.  I mean, by my third, my, my fourth, fifth, and sixth year, I didn't want to move.  The parents didn't want me out.  The teachers that were still there with me didn't want me gone, and the students loved me, so I didn't want to go.  But in that district [Granite School District] at that time, they make changes every six to eight years.  And my sixth year was up, so the school board made--put me in another assignment at another school.  But, yeah, that was, that was a pretty rough time.
Story_ID: 570175
Speaker 1: I was wondering if you had any preparation for that kind of thing.  Did you anticipate it at all, or did anybody try to warn you about what might happen or?
Speaker 2: Nope, nope, there was no warning.  It just came full force.  There was no preparation and I don't even know if they, if anyone knew how to prepare, prepare the community for a black woman coming in to be principal of their school, or prepare the school [Arcadia Elementary School, Salt Lake City, Utah].  Now what, what the people at the school and what the people at, in the community wanted to do, they wanted me to change who I was in order to be their principal.  And changing who I was meant giving parents what they wanted, each parent, giving teachers what they wanted, whether they were right or wrong, buying into that system.  I had, I had one person to say to me--because I, you know, I didn't get angry with them.  I didn't curse anyone out.  I just did my job, and I did it well, and I did my homework, and I was very firm in what I believed.  And I had one person to say to me one time, "You're such a good person, you should be a Mormon."  So, I said, "Are you saying that only Mormons, or people that are LDS [The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints] can be good people?"  "Well, I really didn't mean that way."  I said, "Well, that's how it came off."  I'm not Mormon.  I'm Baptist, you know, and I'm a person.  I'm who I am, and I can't change that.  The assistant superintendent said to me one time, "What can I do to help you?"  I said, "Well, you've got to support who I am, and what I'm doing."  And I said, "You can't change me.  I'm a black woman, an African American woman; you can't change that.  It's what it is, it's who I am.  And you have to, you know, you have to respect that.  That's the only thing you can do to help me.  Support the work that I do, you know, don't let my race or my gender interfere with what I'm doing professionally."

Story_ID: 570177
Speaker 1: So, we got to you, I think, about 1990, you've got, after six years, you were reassigned to another school?
Speaker 2: Yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And by this time, things have worked out, you said?  Or people were pretty much--
Speaker 2: Well, by this time, I mean, my reputation for being a good principal, a great principal, was in place.  And I didn't have, as--I didn't have the same things that I dealt with my first and second years, I didn't have to deal with that at the school any longer.  A few teachers had, had been moved on to other places, and a few had chosen to be moved, and a couple had to be moved.  And so, then it was time to be assigned to another school.  So, I was assigned to Roosevelt Elementary School [Salt Lake City, Utah] in the same district [Granite School District], smaller school.  And I was in that school for two years, and did not encounter anything similar to what I encountered at Arcadia Elementary School [Salt Lake City, Utah].
Speaker 1: Now, what, by this time, were there other black principals or administrators--
Speaker 2: Nope.
Speaker 1: You still were the only one?
Speaker 2: Still--there were other administrators--
Speaker 1: Um-hm, but no--
Speaker 2: --but not principals.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, yeah, by this time--let me see.  Yes, by this time, I was still the only African American principal in the state.  But soon after that, I think about my second year at Roosevelt Elementary School, there was, there were a couple of, there was another one assigned to a junior high school in the same district.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So, how was--the experience at Roosevelt was better than, much better.
Speaker 2: The experience at Roosevelt was nothing like the experience at Arcadia.  And I, I think it was because my reputation preceded itself, and that pe- they probably, the community and the teachers and everyone probably checked with the people at Arcadia to see, hey, how did this person do?  Is this what we want?  And, as a matter of fact, they embraced my coming to Roosevelt Elementary School as they were embracing my being at Arcadia Elementary School towards the latter part of my being there.  But the first part, you know, the, those few people really did keep, keep things stirred up.
Speaker 1: Were there certain major accomplishments at Arcadia that they would have heard about that made them embrace you?
Speaker 2: Well, yes, they--I mean, academically, the school had gone to another level in terms of test scores, and they were maintaining.  There were, there were people that wanted to bring their students there to the school because I was there, which was a good thing.  And these were black people, as well as white people, that wanted their kids to come to that school.  We had also been in line to become a Blue Ribbon School [National Blue Ribbon School of Excellence].  We didn't make it that year, but it was, we were in line to come a national school of recognition by the U.S. Department of Education.  We had also received a couple of other awards as a school and, yeah, some things had--good things had happened at the school since--
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So, so you were at Roosevelt for two years in (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I was--
Speaker 1: --nineteen ninety [1990] to 1992?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 570178
Speaker 1: And then, where did you go after Roosevelt [Roosevelt Elementary School, Salt Lake City, Utah]?
Speaker 2: Okay.  At, towards the end of my second year at Roosevelt, I received a call from--I think it was an assistant superintendent in Salt Lake City School District.  See, Roosevelt and Arcadia [Arcadia Elementary School, Salt Lake City, Utah] are in Granite School District.  Salt Lake City School District is a sister district just next door.  So, I received a call from an assistant superintendent in Salt Lake City School District asking if I would consider applying for a principalship at a junior high school in Salt Lake City School District.  And that school was Clayton el- Clayton Junior High School [Clayton Middle School, Salt Lake City, Utah], and so I did.  I, I went in and I applied for that principalship, but I didn't get that school.  And so, I basically made a decision to go back to Roosevelt.  It would be okay if I stayed there.  Things were going well.  And then, maybe a month or so later, I received a call from that same individual asking if I--saying that a job had opened up at another junior high school.  Would I apply?  And so, I did.  And that's when I got to go to Bryant Intermediate School.  Now, it's called Bryant Middle School in Salt Lake district, and I went there and I was there for four years.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, here are some of the things--I have a list of some things that our staff pulled together that you did at Bryant.  You instituted Saturday classes for students who played hooky?  Did you (laughter)--
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Yeah.  At, okay, at, at Bryant, all--each of my schools, what I had to do was I had to go in and the first thing we had to do was get the school management under control.  So, we started with a school wide concept of school wide management, which meant that as a school, we had to have a school wide plan, and every teacher had to have a plan.  So, I did that at every school that I've gone in, and I did it at Bryant as well.  And one of the consequences for students, you know, at a certain level was that they had to have Saturday school.  And that was, that was because of the students--we did this in terms of the attendance.  When students would come to school tardy X number of times, they had to go to Saturday school.  And Saturday school would operate from 8:30 A.M. until twelve noon, the Saturday school.  And during that time, they actually went to three different sessions and they worked on character education.  So, we had, we had curriculum that dealt with character building in each of the classes that they had to rotate through (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.  So, it wasn't the regular curriculum, but they worked on how to be at school on time and how to, come, stay in school, and that sort of thing.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  Um-hm.  Now, the, the assignments that they had, a lot of times dealt with math, dealt with reading and, and writing, as well as sometimes they had to do some social studies in those--.  So, there was an infusion of the regular curriculum, but mainly, it was to build character with these students.  So, we did the Saturday school.  We did, we had a high school graduation program that ran out of Bryant.  This was, this was also the school that received a Blue Ribbon while I was there.  That's that school of excellence award [National Blue Ribbon School of Excellence].
Speaker 1: So, this is Bryant that got the Blue Ribbon?
Speaker 2: That's Bryant.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: All right.  So, there's a lot of information that says here that you instituted the Saturday school, that you created a music program that produced two bands and an orchestra.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  The music program had kind of died down at, at Bryant.  And so, we got a new music teacher in--we got two new music teachers in.  The vocal music program was very strong, but the instrumental music program had died down a little.  And so, we brought in a teacher that basically started building that instrumental music program again.  And the--we actually didn't hire an orchestra teacher.  The band teacher's wife was an orchestra person, so she volunteered to come in and get the orchestra going again, too, yeah.  So, we ended up having several bands, including the jazz band, and the concert band, and an orchestra--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --while I was there.
Speaker 1: Did you get a chance to get personally involved in the band or the orchestra?
Speaker 2: I did.  I, I played with the group a couple of times, and with the choir, I directed the choir on several occasions.  We had the choir to come and visit our church, and they rendered some music during the regular service.  And this was, this was a neat experience for these kids because most of them were LDS children that had never been outside of their LDS church.  And so, it was a good experience for them to come to, to the church that I belonged to, New Pilgrim Baptist Church [Salt Lake City, Utah], and actually be a part of the service.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: LDS meaning The Church of the Latter-day Saints [The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints], right?  The Mormons--
Speaker 2: Yes, that--Mormons, right.
Speaker 1: The Mormon church.
Speaker 2: Most of those children belonged to that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now you added adult education?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Now, how important was that to what you were doing there?  I mean--
Speaker 2: What we did was we created a community center at the school.  And adult education was, was one of the, one of the programs that we ran out of community education, or community center.  And this offered adults an opportunity if they hadn't finished high school to come in and to work through and to get a high school diploma.  So, that's the adult education piece that we had.  We also did programs for--to service the community, like we offered classes for, getting the food handlers permit 'cause people needed to get jobs.  We offered classes where Spanish speakers could come in and learn to speak English, so English as a second language, we offered those as well.
Story_ID: 570179
Speaker 1: Okay, this is the Blue Ribbon School now.  Tell us about the Blue Ribbon process [National Blue Ribbon Schools Program].  Who awards the blue ribbons, and what does it mean?
Speaker 2: First of all, you have to be nominated by the state, so we were nominated by the state office of education [Utah State Board of Education].  And then, after it goes to the state, then it goes to a national committee to make a determination if they're going to send out representatives to really take a look at the school inside and out.  They looked at every program.  They looked at before school programs, after school, regular ed [regular education] programs.  They went through all of the classrooms.  They, they went through the entire school.  They had interviews with teachers, with parents, with students, with district people, with school administrators and, basically, they turned the school inside and out.  They look at test scores over a period of time to see if there's been, you know, if--what the test scores are doing.  Are they, are they remaining the same, or are they going down?  Are they going up?  So, they took a look at that and they, they look at everything.  And they put it on a grid to determine if the school is quality for a Blue Ribbon School of Excellence award [National Blue Ribbon School of Excellence].
Speaker 1: Now, who gives the Blue Ribbon?
Speaker 2: The U.S. Department of Education.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, that's right, U.S. Department of Education.
Speaker 2: So, after we have that process of having someone from the national office come in--from the Department of Education come in and do this look the school over inside and out for two days, then the recommendation is made that the school become a Blue Ribbon school.  And that's what happened with us.  And then, so I took a team of people and we went to Washington, D.C. where we received the, the award.
Speaker 1: Now, the award was presented in 1996, right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And President Bill Clinton [President William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton] was in office then?
Speaker 2: President Bill Clinton, we had a chance to meet President Clinton and the--Riley, Richard Riley?  Department of Education.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So that was a, that was a big event, that was an exciting time for Bryant [Bryant Intermediate School; Bryant Middle School, Salt Lake City, Utah].
Speaker 1: So, these are schools from every state in the union present?
Speaker 2: Yes.  And I have to say that our school was the only school in the state that year.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, schools--if a school is in a particular state and didn't make the grade, they didn't, they weren't there (laughter), right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So, you had to be a certain quality--
Speaker 2: There were others--
Speaker 1: --not just from, not just the best in the state, but the--
Speaker 2: Right.  You, yeah, you have to be of certain--.  There could have been more schools to make it, but they didn't pass the test, so to speak, when it was time to, you know, to do all that that you have to do to pass the test, which means taking a look at, making sure those test scores have gone up, you know.  What kind of curriculum are you using?  Are you meeting the needs of all kids at all levels?  What are you doing?  You, you might not be meeting them, but what are you doing to assure that you will be meeting the needs of all of your students?  How's your attendance records?  What's happening with those tardies?  See, that's why Saturday school came in handy.  Those kids learned that they had to be to school on time.
Speaker 1: So, I know in Chicago [Illinois], they have a series of magnet schools and such that really group all the smartest kids together--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and put them in schools.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Now, this is, you didn't have that kind of situation here?
Speaker 2: No, this was, this was a traditional middle school.  We have schools like that in the state, but this school was not a school of that nature.  We di- they--we didn't have a magnet program per se, but we had people that wanted their kids to come to the school because it was a good school.  It was a school that I mean, dil- did well academically.  Did all of the kids reach the top?  No, but did we have programs for them?  Yes, we did.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So, was there open enrollment like a parent said, if I wanted my kid go to Bryant, and he was in another school district, I guess, in that neighborhood, could I send him to Bryant?
Speaker 2: Right, yes.  And that started about my second year.  They had the open enrollment.  Actually, it was a state thing that came about, the open enrollment.  So, there's a block of time from January through March, the end of February, that they had a time to, to apply to come to the school.  And that's only if you have space, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Well, this is a big, this is a big deal to be, you know, a Blue Ribbon (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, it is--
Speaker 1: --nominated school, 1996.
Story_ID: 570180
Speaker 1: In the time, just before you went to D.C. [Washington, D.C.] to accept the award, you enrolled in a doctoral program at University of Utah [Salt Lake City, Utah], right?
Speaker 2: Yes, got to be crazy, huh (laughter)?
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes, I enrolled in the doctorate program at University of Utah, applied for it, and was accepted.  And so then, I became a student, a doctoral student, at the University of Utah.  And that was--what, about my third year at Bryant [Bryant Intermediate School; Bryant Middle School, Salt Lake City, Utah]?  My third year there.
Speaker 1: So, this--
Speaker 2: And then, interestingly enough, here I am in the doctorate program.  And an opening comes along at West High School [Salt Lake City, Utah].  Well, there's a story behind that, too.
Speaker 1: Well, what's that story?  I mean, does it--
Speaker 2: Well, that, that story--
Speaker 1: --'cause you're getting awards.  (Unclear) you're getting awards.  The YMCA [Young Men's Christian Association] gave you an award.  Probably other people are giving you awards.  A lot of recognition, you go to Blue Ribbon [National Blue Ribbon School of Excellence], and meet Clinton [President William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton] and all that, and you're already in the doctoral program.  That doesn't hurt you in the doctoral program and be winning awards, does it?  I mean, all, you know, and that sort of thing.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: But then, then you got offered this position at West--
Speaker 2: At West High School.
Speaker 1: --West High School in '96 [1996].
Speaker 2: And there were a lot of awards that came along, you know, on my journey.  There were some others that came along when I got to West, but West was a school that was in trouble.  West High School had had several principals over--I'd say four or five years.  The, the situation at West, they were in the middle of a lawsuit with, over, over--it was the Rachel Bauchman case [Bauchman v. West High School].  I don't know if you remember that--
Speaker 1: What happened?
Speaker 2: --out, out of Utah.
Speaker 1: Can you tell us what happened?
Speaker 2: Well, it was a Jewish girl that was in the choir who objected to, to the teacher [Richard Torgerson] having the students sing a particular song that referenced God and religion that she didn't appreciate.  And so, for that reason, it ended up being a court case, a situation that had to go to court.  And, basically, the teacher was told that the students couldn't sing that song at graduation anymore at that time.  And that, that year, the year before I got there, they--I think it was the year before I got there--they did, they did the graduation, and the students sang the song anyway.  And when the students started singing the song, people got up out of the audience and walked out of Abravanel Hall [Salt Lake City, Utah].  Many of them did.  And then, there were students that were in the choir that turned their backs, while others continued to sing the song.  So, it did, it ended up going to court.  I wasn't a part of, of the, the lawsuit itself, but I did have to testify, you know, about some things that were going on at school when I got there.
Story_ID: 570181
Speaker 1: So, when I got there, when the opening came along, the principal that had been there, had resigned for health reasons, he said.  And so, they had brought in an interim principal, someone that had been a principal there before, and this person was serving as the principal.  I came in, I interviewed for the job probably March.  So, I was still the principal at Bryant [Bryant Intermediate School; Bryant Middle School, Salt Lake City, Utah], and accepted the position probably March, April--late March, April, so I had an opportunity to devise a plan of how I was going to go in and do what I could do.  And so, that's what I, I started doing, but the principal before me had resigned.  Interim came in, so the school was kind of in turmoil.  You had, you had feuds going on between teachers.  You had feuding going on with the teachers and the parents.  The neighborhood was in an uproar.  It was, it was not a pretty thing.  And, and besides that, the school, in terms of the kids, were out of control.  The kids were in the halls all day long, not in classes.  They were making out in the halls.  The place had garbage--it has four levels.  Their lunchtime, you would think you had a cafeteria on every floor.  There was trash all over the building.  It was, it was not good.
Speaker 2: What's the first thing you do to solve that kind of problem?
Speaker 1: Well--
Speaker 2: The order problem, I guess and--
Speaker 1: The order problem?  Well, for me, I had to get people to recognize that there was a problem 'cause I knew I couldn't go in and singlehandedly clean up that school; I needed people to work with me on that.  Did I have everyone to work with me?  No.  Were there people fighting?  Yes.  But the majority of the people wanted, wanted the school, you know, they wanted a good school.  The one thing about West: West was, and it still is, it's a magnet school for the International Baccalaureate program, which is a really good program for students.  And so, there were people wanting to send their kids from across the state to the school 'cause it was the only IB school in the state.  And so, we needed to clean that up, so that we could, you know, keep that reputation of people wanting to, to come bring their, have their students come to West High School [Salt Lake City, Utah].  So, the first thing I knew I had to do was I had to build some allies.  And so, I took time to meet with every teacher individually, and then I took time to go out into the community working through the community council and the PTSA [Parent Teacher Student Association].  I set up cottage meetings out in the community where I could go out, and people could talk with me face to face, ask questions, you know, I would tell them goals that, you know, I had for the school, and what plans we had.  And then, they could ask me questions so that they could get to know me and trust me.  And I think that helped tremendously having those individual meetings with teachers, having the meetings with the parents out in the community, and then also meeting with groups of students, starting with the student government, and then other groups of students.  And then, I set myself up for lunchtime meetings with kids that wanted to come in, and talk with me.  I would go to a particular area where they could just come in, and just ask questions.  And so the first thing we all recognized was we've got to get these kids in classes, you know.  So, the management, the school wide management program needed to have a focus and needed--everyone needed to come together on that.  And so, the--I had, I was quite familiar with school wide management and the program that I need- that we needed to put in place.  So, I expressed that to them how we could do that.  We had, we had the president of the company that I work for now, the consulting company [Simmons Associates - The Education Company], we had him [Bert Simmons] to come in and train the entire faculty.  And then from that, not only did we have him to come in one time, but we had him as a consultant to continuously work in the school.  And we also had him working along with the feeder schools, our two main junior high schools, which one was Bryant, and the other one was Northwest [Northwest Intermediate School; Northwest Middle School, South Lake City, Utah].  And then, the feeder elementary schools, we also had him working with those schools as well.  So, that helped, you know, to build that management base to the point that students began to recognize that we had a plan, and we had expectations for them.  And those expectations didn't include hanging out in the halls, and making out in the halls.  For me, visibility was very, very important for the kids to get to know me, for the parents to see me, get to know me, for the teachers to know that I was there to support them.  And so, that's the focus I took when I went into that school.
Story_ID: 570182
Speaker 1: So you were there in, you were at West High School [Salt Lake City, Utah]--
Speaker 2: For seven years.
Speaker 1: Seven years, okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: That's until 2002, I guess, right?  I think, is that, oh, yeah--
Speaker 2: Hm, 2003.
Speaker 1: Two thousand three [2003], okay.
Speaker 2: Ninety-six [1996], '97 [1997] to 2003. Okay.
Speaker 1: Yes.  West High School, it's a great school--
Speaker 2: All right.  Okay.  What--
Speaker 1: --great kids.
Speaker 2: Now what's the I CARE program?
Speaker 1: The I CARE program?  That was the care to education program that really started when I was at Bryant [Bryant Intermediate School; Bryant Middle School, Salt Lake City, Utah].  And the acronym I CARE means integrity, it's compassion, action, responsibility or respect, and excellence.  And it was a care to education program that was put together by the principal--by the principal at one of the feeder elementary schools, the then acting principal at West High School, and I was principal at Bryant when we put that together, but we carried that from the elementary to the high school.  And it's a character building program.  It's a lot of the information that the students had when they were in Saturday school, plus infused throughout curriculum in the entire school.
Story_ID: 570183
Speaker 1: Did you have many black students at West High School [Salt Lake City, Utah]?
Speaker 2: Not many, but we had some.  We had a lot more at West than I had at my middle school or my elementary schools.  It's about--let me see--I would say, probably about 20 percent when I started there, black students.  The largest minority group at West, and it continues to be, is the Spanish speaking group.  That's the largest population, but the other one is growing--it has been growing over years is Polynesian.  And at West, I might mention that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So mostly Samoans, is it?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Yeah.
Speaker 2: Tongans and Samoans, but I might mention that at West, when I was there, there were forty-seven different languages spoken at the school.  So, it's definitely a multicultural school, and it's--West was also, is also the oldest high school in the state.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So it, is it actually the oldest facility?  Or just I mean, the oldest continuous high school?
Speaker 2: The oldest continuous high school in the state, right, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.  But it's not in the same old building that it (laughter)--?
Speaker 2: Oh, no.
Speaker 1: Or is it?  Okay--
Speaker 2: It's not the same old building.
Speaker 1: All right.  Okay.
Story_ID: 570184
Speaker 1: So, you received your Ed.D. from University of Utah [Salt Lake City, Utah] in what year?
Speaker 2: In--let's see, I finished my course work in 2000, graduated in March in 2001?
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So, it took a while with all the activity and stuff, I guess.
Speaker 2: Well, yeah, it did, it did, and then, it takes a while to get that research, too.
Speaker 1: Now, the--
Speaker 2: And, you probably want to know, at any points, did I think, I, I don't want to do this, I can't do this.  There were.  But then, that something, that something that's in me, just as my mother [Delma Smith Moore] said to me, "You can do this, you will do this," and I did.  I just stuck with it, not looking at, not looking at it as I'm going through, just going through it, and getting it done.
Speaker 1: Now, what was your dissertation about?
Speaker 2: The socialization of African American principals in predominantly Euro-American schools.  I wanted to find out how I did it.  And, and so, I looked at--my research is on, is actually--my study actually was on five African American principals.  And in my research, at the beginning of my research, I actually tell my story, and how I was socialized my first year [as the principal of Arcadia Elementary School, Salt Lake City, Utah]; the socialization.  So, with these principals, I looked at their, how, how they did it, what happened to them, their first year as principals in these predominantly Euro-American schools.
Story_ID: 570185
Speaker 1: Let me go--let me go back to West High School [Salt Lake City, Utah] for another (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 1: --minute.  But, you had--West High School had Utah's largest high school foreign language enrollments.  You just, I think we just alluded to that, but not like that, had a, has a renowned International Baccalaureate program, had the highest percentage of National Merit [National Merit Scholarship Program] finalists.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Now, that's important, so would you say when you were there and, well, it seems that West High was supposed to be the, the, the high school--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --in Salt Lake City [Utah], the, the most important high school?
Speaker 2: Well, the magnet program, the International Baccalaureate program, is the program that drew parents and students to that school.  But the other part, many of the, the highest scholars were the kids that are part of the IB program, but some of the kids came to West because they wanted to be there.  They, they just, they wanted to be at West High School.  The school has a lot of history and tradition.
Story_ID: 570186
Speaker 1: Okay, the traditions and history of West High School [Salt Lake City, Utah].
Speaker 2: A lot of the students that attend West had parents, and their parents, and their parents that attended the school.  And so, there's history with the sports teams, the football, basketball, you know, the track.  It's history with that, people that played, and so, they want their kids to be there as well, but then, we have that magnet program.  Not only did they have the magnet program for the International Baccalaureate, but there's a special program for seventh and eighth grade students.  It's a magnet program.  We call it, they call it--we, when I was there--the extended learning program.  It's a gifted program for seventh and eighth grade students.  So, there are about 180 seventh and eighth grade students that get an opportunity to go there.  So, that's another way to, you know, get students in the school.  But the main, the main reason the, the kids that probably are in that National Merit [National Merit Scholarship Program] category are there is because of the International Baccalaureate program.  But then, there are a lot of kids that are involved in the honors classes as well, you know, advanced placement in honors classes, too.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, is this--is West High School the school that some of the more famous Utah residents would have attended if they were, you know--
Speaker 2: Uh--
Speaker 1: --your senators and congressmen, and governors, and?
Speaker 2: Yes.  And one such person--I don't think you have him on your list is Duane Bourdeaux.  He was a state representative for several years here in the state and he went, he attended that school.  Another one you will interview is Judge Robertson [HistoryMaker Shauna Graves-Robertson] attended that school, and her mother [Augustine Coleman Morgan] attended that school.  My mother-in-law attended that school.  So it does, you know, it has quite a bit of history.
Story_ID: 570187
Speaker 1: So, you were there until 2002 (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Three [2003].
Speaker 1: Two thousand three [2003], I'm sorry.  Well, now, did you retire after that or did you--
Speaker 2: I--no, when, in 2003, superintendent [McKell Withers] asked me would I consider going to be the director for career and technical education for the district?  And so, I accepted that position.  It's CTE director in Salt Lake City School District.  And then, I was there for two years, I did that for two years, and then, I retired in 2005.  And the day that I actually made my final decision to sign the paperwork and retire, I received a call from Bert Simmons saying--just, just to chitchat.  He's the one that's over the behavior management program that I spoke of earlier.  He's the president of the company.  And I said, "Well, guess what, Bert?"  I said, "I just retired from the district."  And he said, "Well, good, now you can come work for us full time."  So, that's how I got into the consulting piece of it with Bert.
Speaker 1: So, what's the group called?  Is it--
Speaker 2: The--it's a behavior management program.  The group?
Speaker 1: I mean, the organization that--
Speaker 2: Okay, it's--
Speaker 1: --Bert Simmons runs?
Speaker 2: --Bert Simmons Associates [Simmons Associates - The Education Company].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But then, I also have my own company, which is called Jam G, J-A-M, big G, Consulting [Jam G Consulting, Inc., Salt Lake City, Utah].  So, I work for Bert's company, and then I do work for myself as well in terms of consulting--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --which, which is budding, you know, it's just growing--my company is.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 570188
Speaker 1: Oh, I forgot to mention, in 1999, you received the Principal of the Year Award?
Speaker 2: Yes, we forgot that one, huh (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) It's one of the, yeah, that's given by the Salt Lake City [Utah] school board?
Speaker 2: The state, it's a state award.
Speaker 1: State, okay.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Okay.  And I received that for the state.  I was Utah Principal of the Year in 1999, and in line for the National Principal of the Year, attended the, the conference where they announced the National Principal of the Year, but didn't get that one.  But I was the state principal of the year--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --which you have to be nominated for, and then selected.
Speaker 1: Now, you were also the--honored by the National Conference for Community and Justice--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --in 2002.
Speaker 2: NCCJ in 2002.  That--at our, at West High School [Salt Lake City, Utah], we were involved with a program that was sponsored by NCCJ.  It was called the ANYTOWN program.  And what it was, we had students, and we had students that would go to a camp for, for three or four days or for a week long.  And they would just really learn to understand differences and injustices.  And then, so these kids that attended this ANY- these ANYTOWN camps were very influential when they came back to school and keeping the school at peace, and not at war, and having the groups.  Because the school was so diverse these kids had to learn to get along together.  And so, this helped.  That was the ANYTOWN program, and so I worked closely with the executive director, or the president of that company to get that program at our school.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, you also received the Rosa Parks Award from the NAACP [NAACP Salt Lake Branch, Salt Lake City, Utah] in 2002.
Speaker 2: In 2002, yes, I did.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Rosa Parks Award from the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People].  That was quite an honor to, to be given an award in honor of someone like Rosa Parks, so I was very appreciative and humbled to receive that award.
Story_ID: 570189
Speaker 1: Now you're charter president for the Utah Alliance of Black School Educators.  Now, this must have occurred I suppose in the '80s [1980s] or something way back (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, way back, yeah, it did.
Speaker 1: Way back in, okay--
Speaker 2: We--
Speaker 1: --about when, do you have a guess as when this happened 'cause I know all the black organizations were formed, associations at one point?
Speaker 2: I'm going to say around 1986, somewhere about, we formed a chapter here.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And this was after having attended the NABSE conference.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then we formed our alliance here and, yes, I was a, a charter member of that group--
Speaker 1: Okay so it's affiliated with the national association of black school educators [National Alliance of Black School Educators]?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And when we came on board, Chuck Moody [HistoryMaker Charles D. Moody, Sr.] actually came out here and was with us for--Chuck and, and Chris [ph.] were here with us for a couple of days as we put this all together.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Yeah Charles Moody, who now lives in Las Vegas [Nevada]?
Speaker 2: Who now lives in Las Vegas.  Right.
Speaker 1: Yeah, from Michigan, University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And let's see, and you hold memberships in the UASSP, the NASSP, and the University of Utah chapter of Phi Delta Kappa [Phi Delta Kappa Fraternity].
Speaker 2: And others--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and other organizations.  UASSP and NASSP were the school--the National Association for Secondary School Principals [sic. National Association of Secondary School Principals], and the UASSP was the Utah Association for Secondary School Principals [sic. Utah Association of Secondary School Principals].
Speaker 1: Okay.  And you've been a member of New Pilgrim Baptist Church [Salt Lake City, Utah].  Have you been, you know, since you've come to, has this been your home church since you've been here in Utah (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, that's my home church, New Pilgrim Baptist Church is my home church.
Story_ID: 570190
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Could I mention one other organization--
Speaker 2: Oh, sure.  Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: --that you, you evidently don't have.  And that's our local chapter of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority; that's Upsilon Beta Omega Chapter.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And that chapter was chartered in 1994.  And I'm a charter member of that organization, that group, Upsilon Beta Omega Chapter of Alpha Kappa Alpha.
Speaker 2: Okay.  And that's--now, you joined, you know, some years after college [Virginia State College; Virginia State University, Petersburg, Virginia].
Speaker 1: Yes, I--
Speaker 2: So, so--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  I joined in, in, I joined the graduate chapter in Las Vegas [Nevada] in 1980, just before I came to Salt Lake City [Utah].  And that, you know, I just didn't have the time or the money to join an undergraduate chapter, but I became a member of Alpha Kappa Alpha in 1980--1981, I'm sorry, 1981, and have, I've been a member since.  And so, when we came here, we didn't have--when I came here, we didn't have a chapter and we started meeting as an interest group because AKAs come together sooner or later, in some kind of way.  So, there were about eight or ten of us that would meet periodically, formed an interest group, and then we proceeded with doing what we needed to do to be chartered.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: So, this kind of speaks to the AKA being more than just a social organization for undergraduate college girls to--
Speaker 1: Absolutely.
Speaker 2: --being more of a service organization.  So, I hear a lot of people say they joined grad chapters of the--or are active, very active in those chapters.
Speaker 1: Right, because of that focus on service and helping others and I mean, it's, it's really great.  Right now, I'm the president of our local chapter and we do a number of things throughout the year.  Our goal this year is to--when we finish our programs, we want to have, we will have had at least one hundred programs that we have done in our community by the end of this boule year because this is centennial year for Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, one hundred years, so we want to do one hundred programs.  And we're pretty close to it.  We have probably close to seventy programs that we've already put in place.  And this is service for the community, that's the neat thing about it.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And scholarships, you know, helping others.
Story_ID: 570191
Speaker 1: Just ask you one more question about education before we--I go into some of the philosophical questions to tie up the interview.  But being--is diversity or--tell us a little about the dynamics of diversity, I guess, in Utah, you know, we talk about some of the racial groups that are here, and is it, was it harder to, you think it's, is it harder to operate as, you know, when you're such a small minority, you know, a state like Utah?
Speaker 2: It, it really isn't as long as you know--you remember who you are, and know that the struggle continues no matter where you are that, as a black person, you, you know, always have to be prepared and you always have to do what you know is the right thing to do.  And I think the, the greatest part in terms of racism that I felt, I expressed earlier was when I served as principal of my first school [Arcadia Elementary School, Salt Lake City, Utah] because that was such a new experience for everyone.  It was new for me, it was new for the community, it was new for the students, new for the teachers.  Diversity, I think here, people began to embrace it more.  Diversity itself.  For example, at our church [New Pilgrim Baptist Church, Salt Lake City, Utah], we have several different nations that are represented, probably over thirty, and that's embraced because the church now has a strong focus on multiculturalism.  And the same thing, a similar type thing happened in the schools that I've been in, especially at West High School [Salt Lake City, Utah].  But I think it's important that people, that our young folks understand who they are and feel good about who they are, and be strong about who they are, and don't let anyone change who they are, you know, because I think, as a race, we have a lot to be proud of.
Story_ID: 570192
Speaker 1: Do you have a certain philosophy of education that would--that's--well, what is your philosophy of education?
Speaker 2: In terms of education, first of all, I believe that every student can learn.  And I think it's important that everyone works together to do the best for every student and to keep the expectations high.  In terms of learning, some kids learn a little bit slower than others.  Some kids move on very, very well alone.  Some kids need a lot of support--some don't, but it's important for us to be there for every student because every student can get it.  It might take a little bit longer for some, but they can get it and we should never give up on them.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: These kids are our future.  We can never give up on them.
Speaker 1: Now, who do you read or who would you recommend to other black educators to read and to, you know, be informed by, I guess, today?
Speaker 2: One of the, one of the writers that I like because of her flare on multiculturalism and understanding black children is Lisa Delpit, 'Other People's Children' ['Other People's Children: Cultural Conflict in the Classroom'].  That was one of my favorite books to read.  Right now, I'm, in terms of social reading, I read a lot of different things from the book club that I'm in, you know.  I will--we're getting to read one of Easy Rawlins' [Ezekiel "Easy" Rawlins] books.  You're familiar, familiar with him?  I don't know.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Walter Mosley's, Easy Rawlins here (unclear).
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  Um-hm.  Walter Mosley.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Story_ID: 570193
Speaker 1: We always ask this question: what are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: My concern is that we still have kids--students, children--that are not receiving what they should receive in terms of their educational foundation.  They're not, they're not, it's not there.  My concern is that we need to make sure we have the teachers in place because that's where it is--in the classroom with the kids, the kid, the teachers that believe in these students, the teachers that will motivate them, that will push them to the next level.  My other concern is that the, the parental support.  Parents are very busy people, but parents have to recognize the fact that they're the most significant people in their children's lives and be there for them and be in support of what goes on at the school.  I'm, I'm concerned about these children that are just being to raise themselves without parental support, without the support of the schools, without the support of the educational system.  That is a, that's a concern for me.
Story_ID: 570194
Speaker 1: When you look back on everything you've done to this point, is there any major thing that you would do differently if you could?
Speaker 2: What would I do differently?  Hm, I probably would have completed my doctorate degree sooner and I probably, if I had completed my doctorate degree sooner, would have maybe continued my dream at that point of becoming a school superintendent.  It's not completely gone, but I think I had a little more energy and time had I--I would have had I done it sooner so.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I mean, I'm not disappointed in what I've done, but if I were to do something differently, I would have gotten my doctorate degree sooner.
Story_ID: 570195
Speaker 1: Likewise, if you look back at your career to this point, what, today, would you consider to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: My legacy is probably in education, coming in as the first African American principal in the state [Utah], mentoring and helping other principals to come in to the various districts.  I believe that's my legacy.  My legacy is working in the educational arena with children and with other school administrators.
Story_ID: 570196
Speaker 1: Tell us a little bit about your family.  We talked about how you met your husband.
Speaker 2: Yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Do you have any children?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Lloyd [Lloyd Gray] and I have three kids, three children.  I was married before [to Billy Suggs] and I have a son.  His name is Bevan [Bevan Suggs]--we have a son, his name is Bevan.  And then, we have two girls, Dwala [Dwala Gray Toombs] and Denise [Denise Gray Howard].  And between the three children, we have eight grandchildren with the oldest one being fourteen and the youngest one being five.
Story_ID: 570197
Speaker 1: Is there anything I haven't asked you that we need to talk about before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: I don't think so.  I can't think of anything right now.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: All right, so without any hesitation (laughter), the last question is ma'am--it's similar to legacy, but a little different.  How would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: I would like to be remembered as an educator, as an individual who cared about people, who cared about children, who cared about the education of the children, of every child that comes into this world, that they receive what is best for them in terms of their education.
Story_ID: 570198
