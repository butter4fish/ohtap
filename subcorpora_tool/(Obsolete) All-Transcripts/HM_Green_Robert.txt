Speaker 1: All right.  My name is Larry Crowe.  I'm interviewer today for The HistoryMakers.  Our videographer is Matthew Hickey.  Observing is [HistoryMaker] Paul Brock.  Sir, could you please state your name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Robert L. Green, G-R-E-E-N.
Speaker 1: And what is your date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: 11/23/33 [November 23, 1933], I was born in Detroit, Michigan.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, sir, what is your occupation?
Speaker 2: University administrator, professor, researcher, and emeritus.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, all my life has been in the university world.
Speaker 1: And, all right.  And primarily, you're involved in education and psychology, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  My training is in educational psychology.  I've expanded it, and much of my research over the years has involved issues such as poverty, race, social class factors that affect a large segment of the American population.  Initially, my early research was based upon the status of African Americans.  It expanded to looking at the status and disadvantage that all minorities are faced with in our society.
Speaker 1: All right.  And, sir, what is today's date?
Speaker 2: Today's date is September 29th, I believe.
Speaker 1: Thirty, I think it's the 30th, yeah.
Speaker 2: I believe it's September 30th, yeah, September 30th, 2004.
Speaker 1: All right.  And where are we at the present time?
Speaker 2: We're in Las Vegas, Nevada, Doubletree Hotel, for the interview.
Story_ID: 203624
Speaker 1: All right. Now, before we go into depth, there are five lightweight questions we always ask as sort of a warm-up, and they just require a short answer.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: First one is, sir, what is your favorite food?
Speaker 2: It's a shame, but it's probably pound cake and vanilla Haagen-Dazs ice cream, both which are bad for me.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Now, do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Probably gray, gray and--I have two--gray and blue.
Speaker 1: Okay.  A favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Thanksgiving.
Speaker 1: A favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Anywhere where there's a beach and tennis courts.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Probably a day at a time--take it a day at a time, whatever the circumstances are--just, you can handle it if you take it a day at a time.
Story_ID: 203625
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, I'm going to ask you about your family history now.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: I'm going to ask you about your mother's side of the family and your father's [Thomas J. Green] side of the family.  And I'll start with your mother's side.  Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Alberta Batrice Vinson Green, Alberta, A-L-B-E-R-T-A, Batrice, B-A-T-R-I-C-E, Vinson, V-I-N-S-O-N, Green, G-R-E-E-N.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: She was born Christmas day of 1900, December 25th, 1900.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And where was she born?
Speaker 2: Jones County, Georgia, Haddocks--a place called Haddocks Station [Haddock, Georgia] at the time.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Now, what do you know about your mother's side of the family?  How, how far back can you trace the ancestors on that side of the family?
Speaker 2: Probably to her mother [Emma Vinson] and her grandmother who was a full-blooded Cherokee Indian [Native American].  Her mother was born as slavery was ended.  Her mother, as I recall, her--my grandmother, whom I recall--had, did not have a lot of recollection of slavery, but did live on a plantation in Jones County which is, I think, twenty miles south of Milledgeville, Georgia.  She had an upbringing that was very warm and supportive in the family, but not a lot of knowledge of other societal circumstances that affected her and others at the time.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, your grandmother was born--she was born during slavery--was a child when slavery was--
Speaker 2: There's very much--maybe five or six years of age--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --the same as my grandfather.  I recall--that I recall.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But they didn't talk about it much or--
Speaker 2: Not a lot.  She talked about circumstances that she encountered as a young woman in Jones County--the discrimination, the separation, being able to recall the disparities between blacks and whites, and the harshness of those disparities in Georgia.
Speaker 1: Now, did she have any stories about, that you recall that, about any of that?
Speaker 2: Not really.  There's not a lot of oral history centered around her.  I have more oral history about my father's side of the family, but not so much my grandmother's side of the family.  What I recall about her, I got from my mother, but my grandmother died--I think in 1942, '42 [1942] or '43 [1943].  I was about nine or ten years of age at the time.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, is there a story about your great-grandmother who was a Cherokee?  Was there any related, any stories?
Speaker 2: Other than the fact that there was a lot of contact between slaves, African slaves, and Indians during that time. Some black slaves would escape, I was told that, and end up living up with Indian families.  And I'm not sure of the details of this particular situation, but and--for some reason, her--my grandmother's mother was an Indian and some way that was--it was a set of relationships that led to her birth, so she had Indian blood in her and--as did my mother.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now, did you know your grandfather on the other side?
Speaker 2: I didn't know, know him.  He--her husband, I know that he was a carpenter, a very efficient man.  I saw the home that he built from the ground up.  I saw that home when I was about thirty-two years of age.  When I went to work for [Reverend Dr.] Martin [Luther] King [Jr.] in Atlanta [Georgia], I just left one day with my mother, and I saw the site.  I know he was a carpenter, a very skilled carpenter, who built a home from the ground up.  He moved to Detroit [Michigan] and, and did some carpentry work there, but I believe he also worked somewhat in the factory there as well.  But he--and I do recall that he died of diabetes.  There was a history of diabetes on that side, my mother's side of the family, and he died of diabetes.  But I--he died before I was born.  I was born in '33 [1933].  It seems, though, he died in 1926, '25 [1925] or '26 [1926].
Story_ID: 203626
Speaker 1: Now, did your mother [Alberta Vinson Green] have--talk about growing up?  Did she talk about, you know, what life was like for her in Georgia, or did she actually grow up in Georgia?
Speaker 2: She grew up in Georgia.  As for some reason, I don't know why, my mother was able to leave Jones County [Georgia].  And, and her parents got her in a boarding school for black girls near Macon [Georgia] and--
Speaker 1: Do you know the name of it?
Speaker 2: No, no, I don't.  And I'm right now working on family history.  And that's some history that I need to try to unearth.  And my, the family, I have a family--we call her the family historian--my sister, Naomi [Green], has a lot of that information, and she has a lot of notes that my mother kept.  My mother kept good records of what was going on.  And I know that and I know where they are.  They're in a trunk in my sister's home in Detroit [Michigan], and I have not had access to those--not by design, it's just that I have not asked to have access to those.  But a lot of that history, I think might be there.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, she had a chance to go to this boarding school?
Speaker 2: Yeah, my mother probably completed the ninth grade which, in those days, was unusual.  And my dad [Thomas J. Green] was trying to court her in and out of that boarding school and, finally, convinced her to leave, and married her.  And she, so they were married when she was sixteen years of age, and my father was twenty-one.
Speaker 1: Now, did your mother ever have a chance to go back to school and do any more--
Speaker 2: Never--no.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Never did--and she had children.  My mother had fourteen deliveries--nine lived.  But education became kind of a focal point.  I said the addiction in our family was education.  Everyone had to have some sort of education and that kind of has extended over the years.  My mother played a key role in that as did my dad.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, did your mother have any other occupation other than being a housewife at home?
Speaker 2: She was--had babies and was a homemaker, and she didn't--never worked out of the home.  She took in wash, clothing from prominent families.  And my mother also had a kind of a little employment agency in which other black women would come to her, and she met whites who brought laundry to her, and my mother would assign them to work for these folk--I think I recall $2.50, $2.50 a day.  For some reason I remember that.  I think my mother got a quarter of it-twenty-five cents, something like that.  My mother did that.  My mother became very active in the Church of God in Christ, and organized a clothing collection program that became national, and they would send trunks of clothing to Haiti years ago.  And I remembered very well because I used to just feel so awful when I would see our basement filled with clothing because I knew my mother would eventually get these cartons, and fill them with clothing and trunks.  And my brothers and myself, we had to get those out of the basement on a truck to the old Michigan Central train station [Michigan Central Station, Detroit, Michigan].  And this clothing, the clothing was bound for Haiti.  My mother set up a national clothing drive to send clothing to disenfranchised and poor Haitians.  And that was a part of the Church of God in Christ, part of that movement.  My mother got that program started.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, she did, she was involved in three major activities--raising children; two, very active in the Church of God in Christ and with the clothing drive; and also, she had her own employment agency.
Speaker 1: She had three things going on there.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  So, she had, my mother had a very busy life.
Speaker 1: Now, do you have any idea--I know you were young then, but do you have any idea of what the connection was between the Church of God in Christ and Haiti?  Did they have a mission there?
Speaker 2: They had a mission there.  As a matter of fact, my brother [Havious V. Green], who is a very successful Church of God in Christ pastor in Detroit, he built, they recently built--I think, a hospital in Haiti, a small one, but I think there was one completed recently.  And my brother has made several trips to Haiti, and so there's been a Church of God in Christ Haitian mission for quite some time.  And my brother's church, the Antioch Church of God in Christ in Detroit, has played a major role in that respect.
Story_ID: 203627
Speaker 1: You said your parents [Alberta Vinson Green and Thomas J. Green] met when she was in school.  Is there a story associated with how they met?
Speaker 2: My dad often said that they were on nearby plantations.  My dad grew up on a plantation, too, in which they were sharecroppers, basically sharecroppers.  And so, my dad got to know her because of the proximity of the plantation.  And he said he always knew that this is the woman that he wanted to marry, but, of course, there were restrictions.  I think her going to the boarding school was an effort on the part of her mother and father to make sure that they were not together so early.  But they ended up being--so my dad might have started courting her as early as thirteen or fourteen.  And at sixteen, sixteen, they were married.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Thomas James Green, Thomas J. Green.  His official legal name, Thomas J. Green, but "J" was for James.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: He was born in 1895--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and I believe the date of birth is either July 12th or 14th, one or the other.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And was he born in the same place?
Speaker 2: Yes, um-hm, Haddock Station [Haddock, Georgia]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --Jones County [Georgia].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, from what I understand, is the name Green is--harkens back to a slave owner?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  They were--the slave owner's name was Greenberg [ph.].  And a lot of this, I'm trying to verify because I'm working on a family biography.  And my--what my dad did, or what my dad's father [Thomas Green] did, he was seven years, six or seven years of age when slavery ended when they became "so-called free slaves," free people, they dropped the -berg and, and kept the Green.  And many slaves did that.  Some slaves kept, you know, I have a good friend by the name of Jose Bernstein [ph.].  He told me that his family lived on a plantation, but they kept the name and a lot--most slaves did that.  And then, my--in our circu- situation, my grandfather dropped that--the, -berg off and so we were Greens.
Speaker 1: Okay.  This raises sort of an interesting scenario.  I really haven't heard before, although I know it exists, but these are Jewish slave masters, I would assume with Greenberg, and you know.
Speaker 2: Oh, sure.  Well, you know, there was a conference about twelve or thirteen years ago in which black and Jewish historians--black Americans and Jewish American historians came together.  And that was an acknowledgment of the role that Jews played in the slave trade.  Arabs, and Jews, believe or not, were the major money changers during the slave phase, especially in places like Cape Coast [Ghana], where I've been, in Ghana, which is a major slave port.  They were money changers, and Jews had slaves.  That's a part of American history that historians have not written about.  It's a sensitive issue, and it relates today--black Jewish relations.  And so, it's an envelope that academically hasn't been pushed, so to speak.  But there is an acknowledgement that, yes, Jews played a role.  They were slave owners--some--and especially in the South and, too, they were involved in various forms of being a part of the oppressive system.  You know, when you look at Rich's department store in Atlanta [Georgia], which had the same practices as any other store owned by non-Jews, so they--it--that's a part of history that even black historians have treaded on lightly because it's a sensitive topic and there's always a fear of offending the Jewish community, but there is good documentation, yes, that Jews were slave owners, that they were part of the money trade that led to keeping slavery--keeping slaves moving back and forth from Africa to the United States.
Story_ID: 203628
Speaker 1: Okay.  Are there any stories about the Greenbergs [ph.] that are passed down through history?
Speaker 2: I--very--I can remember my dad [Thomas J. Green] was more of an oral historian.  His dad [Thomas Green] told him that Greenberg, the Greenbergs treated the slaves fairly well, in terms of clothing.  When they say, "good treatment," typically, they're talking about clothing, food, and a place to sleep, that they were not oppressive slave owners in that respect, and that there was no resistance to allowing them to leave the plantation once slavery ended.  And that was sometimes a major issue.  When slavery ended, slave owners didn't want slaves to leave because of the economy and the impact on their own livelihood.  So, that was a big issue, but in this particular instance from what I recall, the Greenbergs did not press slaves to stay there.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Are there any other stories about slavery or your ancestors that have come down through the family?
Speaker 2: More of the stories center around my dad, not so--well, my father, my grandfather, Tom, who was also Thomas Green, was the primary caretaker for the family.  But it was back and forth because he had a second family, and I'm just learning about that now. So he spent half the year with my grandmother [Matilda Green], and they had fourteen children.  And then he had another family nearby that he spent half the year with, in which I believe he fathered six children.  So, it came to a point that my dad ended up being the major caretaker in the family, and he negotiated with the landowner.  He negotiated with the sisters and brothers to get them to work on the farm on the land, picking the cotton.  And so, my dad became almost like a father to many of his younger, and older siblings, who didn't have the business foresight than my dad had.  My dad was, you know, quite an entrepreneur in terms of making ends meet.  He knew how to make ends meet, and to make money, and not only as a pastor in a small church in Detroit [Michigan], but also the things he did other than that.  So, I do recall the stories about my grandfather not being and a real attentive parent, a parent.  And my dad emerged as a strong person in the family with the fourteen children.
Speaker 1: You know, that's a lot of responsibility with--
Speaker 2: And he ended up fathering nine of his--fourteen, well, fourteen were born, nine lived.  And my dad was just a strong man and took care of his nine kids in a very strong way.
Speaker 1: Now what you describe is not--I've heard stories like that before of the men and those situations having more than one family--
Speaker 2: Multiple families, um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and then he's like sharecropping, too.  That's really a--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And I, and the thing is, I do recall that he had a sister in Benton Harbor--a half-sister in Benton Harbor, Michigan from the other family that would call Christmas, on Christmas day, when we were there, and would often be tearful on, on the phone.  My dad also--that family also had relatives on the East Coast in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], I understand, that we never met, of course.  Once my dad, once as we--my dad began to establish himself in Detroit with the family, he kind of separated himself from that family, and focused on his family.  My daddy even, kind in a way, separated himself from brothers and sisters to a great extent, to make sure he could focus full-time on raising the nine of us that lived.
Story_ID: 203629
Speaker 1: When did he [Green's father, Thomas J. Green] decide to move to Detroit [Michigan] and how did that take place?  And I think that there's a--since I had the benefit of this other interview (laughter)--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: There's some stories about your father's early development that we don't want to miss, too, about his desire to go to school and some other things.
Speaker 2: Now, my dad, starting at third grade--his father [Thomas Green] tried to get him to leave school and work the fields, which mean third grade, my dad might have been ten or eleven years of age in the South.  My dad begged to go to school and each year, they would allow him to do an extra year.  Finally, after my father had finished the sixth grade, they forced him to, to really devote full time to the fields.  So, my, my dad, who was just a tremendous reader, a good, good mathematician, acquired those skills--maybe, if he didn't acquire them in school, he acquired them pretty much on his own.  And so, then he, when he emerged as the primary care person, caregiver for the family, that lasted until he was probably seventeen, eighteen years of age.  There was a story of him leaving, like a lot of blacks did the South, going north, making money, sending money back, getting brothers and sisters out of the South to the North.  My dad played that role.  My father went to work for Henry Ford.  He was one of the early persons who went to work for Henry Ford at the Ford Motor Car Company [sic. Ford Motor Company, Dearborn, Michigan] for five dollars a day.  And that was a lot of money at that time.  And when he--on one of his return trips to the South to visit, my dad--I think I might have told that story before--was almost lynched.  He worked for a man by the name of Mr. Rose--Jay Rose.  I have a picture of his store.  I think the store is still standing at Haddocks Station [Haddock, Georgia].  My dad was well-known in the county because he was a hard worker and an entrepreneur, and he used to work for Mr. Rose in the store.  My dad, when he was home on a visit, and Rose sent for him.  And when my dad entered the store, he said, there were about nineteen or twenty white men from very young, to middle age, to old, in the store.  As my dad walked in, and Rose closed the door, and had my father in the middle.  Then, Rose said, "Tom," said, "I'm glad to see you back here," said, "How are you? How do you like your work in Detroit?"  My dad was thinking fast.  And my dad said, "Well, I enjoy making the money, but I really miss not being here."  And he said, "Well, Tom, do you ride the street cars or--in Detroit?"  My dad said, "Yes."  He said, "Do you sit next to white people on the street cars?"  My dad said, "No, I don't.  I always go to the back and sit in the back, because I was raised that way, and I haven't changed."  He said, "When you see white people and speak to them, do you say, 'Mr.' and 'Mrs.' and 'yes, ma'am' and 'yes, sir'?"  My dad said, "Always--whenever I speak to a white man, I say-- I state clearly, 'yes, sir,' 'no, sir,' 'Mr.' and 'Mrs.' And I never speak to white women unless they speak to me first, asking for service."  And my dad said when he made that statement, Mr. Rose turned and said to the men in the store--said, "You see, men, I told you, Tom is still okay."  And all the white men left the store.  And so, my dad said that there--they had it staged, so that if he had made the wrong statements, he would have been lynched.  And my dad was fairly sure of this because my dad saw a lynching.  He didn't see the actual lynching.  He saw the aftermath of the lynching--one of his close friends was lynched when my dad was fourteen years of age because he did not get out of the path of a white man quickly enough, because they though he was uppity, so he was lynched.  And after he was lynched, they dragged his body down to the ice house where my dad worked, and left his body at the--made the blacks leave--keep their body at the ice house where they all had to go to get ice for two days.  And then, finally, they allowed them to take the body away.  My dad worked at the ice house for seventy-five cents a day.  So, he had experiences as a young man that were driving forces in him making the decision to leave the South, so he left the South--
Story_ID: 203630
Speaker 1: This is about--this incident, this lynching incident would have been about 1910--I guess, or so?
Speaker 2: Let's see, my dad [Thomas J. Green] was born in '95 [1895]--
Speaker 1: Yeah, then about 1910 if he was about fourteen--1909?
Speaker 2: He was about fourteen, yeah, I think he told me he was fourteen years of age.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And that's a story that I've captured in my writings and I want to make sure that becomes a part of the family history--
Speaker 1: So this is at--
Speaker 2: --so others know about it.
Speaker 1: --yeah, this was at the height of lynching and terror in the South really?
Speaker 2: Yeah, um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: Yeah, it, it was.  And so, that made an impact on my dad.  And it's interesting, my dad did not tell us and me about that lynching until I was about forty years of age.  And I was visiting him in Detroit [Michigan] and by that time, I had a Ph.D.  I was at a university doing research and thinking that I'm important.  And I said, "Dad, why did you not tell me about--and all of us--about that lynching?" which made, obviously made such an impact on him because when he described it, he was kind of trembling.  My dad at that time, must have been maybe 70-some, 70--he died at 83, 84--83, so he might have been approaching 80.  He said, "Well, the reason I didn't tell you all, especially the boys, about the lynching is because I didn't want you to grow up hating white people."  That was his--that was his--just very blunt and very categorical.  He was very categorical about his statement-"I didn't want you to grow up hating white people."  And so, there were other stories, he said.  He could have--I could have shared with you.  But he said, "Why should I have done that?"  I said, "Dad, you should have done it for historical purposes."  He said, and he looked at me in the face, he said, "I just didn't want you to grow up hating white people."  That's all he would say.
Story_ID: 203631
Speaker 1: When he [Green's father, Thomas J. Green] came North to work, he went to Detroit [Michigan], right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he worked there for several years.
Speaker 1: He worked in a--for Henry Ford.
Speaker 2: And then my dad was drafted.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And so, he was drafted out of the South, and he went to Europe.  He was stationed in France, in fought France for fourteen months [during World War I, WWI].  And then, he came back to the United States.  And my history here is not as sharp as it will be, as I continue my work and research on the family.  But I think that there might have been the birth of at least a child or two--my older sister and oldest brother--prior to him going to Europe, but he was drafted and sent with an all-black regiment to Europe.  And they were there for fourteen months and they fought the Germans in France.
Speaker 1: Now, he, he would have been in his early or mid-twenties then--I guess, right?
Speaker 2: About, maybe, twenty-two or so.
Speaker 1: Twenty-three, yeah.
Speaker 2: I have a picture of him in the [U.S.] military uniform, and a picture of my mother [Alberta Vinson Green].  And she, at the time, was about sixteen or seventeen years of age.
Speaker 1: Now, when they got married when she was--
Speaker 2: Sixteen, so--
Speaker 1: Sixteen, yeah.
Speaker 2: --what year would that have been?  She was born--
Speaker 1: 1900--
Speaker 2: --1916.
Speaker 1: --yeah, okay.
Speaker 2: 'Cause she was born in 19-, the (unclear) day 1916, yeah, she was sixteen years old.
Speaker 1: So, so he's--
Speaker 2: And, in those days, you wrote it in the Bible.  They didn't always give you birth certificates, so we have a record of that, that she was sixteen years of age.  I have a picture, and I think on the picture, it says 1916 of my mom and dad together.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now, did he talk about the war, or any of his experiences in the war?
Speaker 2: He, he did--not, not in detail.  My dad was more focused on what happened, the conditions that facilitated his growing up, and the impact of that.  The things I remember about the war, I remember my dad spoke French (laughter).  He had a lot of French--I was amazed--French was my major in college [Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan] at the Ph.D. level, and I was amazed at how much of the language my dad acquired--and remembered, and he picked a lot--and he picked it up there while he was stationed in France.  And he talked about--the officers were white.  All the officers were white, non-commissioned [officer (NCO)] and commissioned officers [CO], were white.  And all the troops were black.  And he didn't talk a lot about the conflict.  Whether he saw direct action or not, I don't know, but there was direct action.  And I would imagine he was a part of it, but he was able to make it back to the [United] States [of America].  And he often talked about how--that's how the first impression I had about the conflict that faced blacks, especially black men who would fight abroad for America, and come back to the South, or to America, and be treated as they were treated, in a very difficult way.  For example, my dad said he never wore his uniform once he returned to the South, and even Detroit [Michigan] because black soldiers were targets.  If a black soldier, my dad would tell me, would travel South with his uniform on, whites would assume he was uppity.
Story_ID: 203632
Speaker 1: You were talking about black soldiers coming over with their [military] uniforms and being kind of afraid to wear their uniforms because of the--
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's--but I heard that first from my dad [Thomas J. Green] that he would never wear his uniform, either in the South when he returned from the war [World War I, WWI] to, to visit, or to northern, in the North in Detroit [Michigan], because black soldiers, ex-soldiers were targets.  There was the assumption that one, you've been abroad.  Two, you were treated like somewhat of a man while you're in the [U.S.] military, and we want to make sure that we keep you in your place.  So, my dad knew that, and that was verified by an incident that I think occurred about 1946.  I recall reading about it as a kid in which a black [U.S.] Army soldier returning to the [United] States [of America] to the South--I can't recall the state--I think it was North Carolina--was lynched by a white mob because he had the audacity to wear the uniform of the United States of America as a soldier, even though he was a bona fide soldier, in the U.S. military, U.S. Army.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And so, that, I remember.  So, my dad would give us a lot of that history and to allow us to understand that you are black in America and you need to know that.  My dad ditched some of that.  My mother [Alberta Vinson Green] did more of that.  My mother was more of a militant person than my dad.  My dad was always the kind of person that would try to mediate, negotiate, and a lot of this--how a lot of black men survived.  But my mother was more outspoken about racism and discrimination than my dad was in a lot of respects.

Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, did your father [Thomas J. Green] come back to Detroit [Michigan] when, after the war [World War I, WWI], or did he--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I believe he came back to Detroit, went to work in the [Ford Motor Company] plants, but he visited back and forth.  My dad wanted his first three children--for some reason, I don't understand why.  I think I know why--to be born in the South, because my mother's mother [Emma Vinson] was there.  So, I think the first three were born in the South, and then brought to Detroit.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, your mother [Alberta Vinson Green] lived in the South until--did she basically live in, in Georgia?
Speaker 2: When my dad was in the [U.S.] military, he was--she was in the South with her, with her family.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: All right.  So, but after the war--
Speaker 2: That we were basically--
Speaker 1: --settled back then.
Speaker 2: --we relocated to Detroit.  My family relocated to Detroit.
Story_ID: 203634
Speaker 1: All right.  Now, can you tell me, what neighborhood did your family live in, in Detroit [Michigan]?  Was it the same one all the time, or did it change?
Speaker 2: North End, the north part, and they call it, the North End of the Detroit--I could remember the address, 13078 Greeley Street in Detroit, where the Chrysler plant is located.  That's where we--my parents [Thomas J. Green and Alberta Vinson Green] lived until I was probably six or seven years of age.  And we were all born at home because I was born in the house, I was born in that house.  My parents then moved to 648 Rosedale [Court] between Oakland [Avenue] and Brush [Street].  And I remember that very well because when we moved in the house, blacks were just beginning to integrate that neighborhood, and we were stoned.  White--I can recall a white mob outside of the house, rocking the house, stoning the house.  And one night, my dad slipped out of the house, got to Toledo, Ohio, and obtained his dad's [Thomas Green] shotgun that my, my--his brother had, drove back to Detroit.  And I remember my dad at, I think, one time, firing over the head of a mob outside of our house.  My brother, Richard [Green], was a baby, and a rock landed in the crib with him, and that's when dad fired out.  After that, we received better police protection.  The mayor at the time was [Edward J.] Jeffries [Jr.], Mayor Jeffries in Detroit, who was there even--I think he was the mayor at the time, might have been--I'm not sure on that.  So, better strike that.  But, anyway, it was not until my dad fired over the head of the mob outside of the house that we begin to receive some strong police protection.
Speaker 1: Now, this is, about what year is this?  How old were you then?
Speaker 2: I was--my brother, Richard, was a baby.  Let's see, I was born in '33 [1933].  Richard was born in '37 [1937], so this had to be about '39 [1939], 'cause we were in that house '38 [1938], '39 [1939].  We were in that house because my brother was--I remember me and my brother being drafted out of that house into the war [World War II, WWII]--my oldest brother.
Speaker 1: Now, this is if I'm--correct me if I'm wrong here--but this is like a tense time in Detroit in terms of racial issues.  Isn't this about the time of the Dr. Ossian Sweet incident [Sweet Trials]?
Speaker 2: That had already occurred, I think, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And the--
Speaker 1: He was defending his home against the same kind of thing: a mob action against his home, throwing rocks at his house, breaking his house, knocking his windows out. Yes, um-hm, um-hm.  My dad didn't shoot anyone. He shot over the mob.  My dad was quite a marksman because he hunted a lot as a kid like--as a lot of black men did.  And there were just a lot of incidents early on in the South that created marksmanship.
Speaker 2: You've heard of [HistoryMaker] Berry Gordy in Motown?  My dad said the Gordy family were known as the best marksman around.  They were, right, they grew up in the same plantation area as my parents.  And there were a lot of boys.  And my dad said, "Whites used to say that the Gordys are crazy--'Don't bother the Gordy family.'"  When whites were afraid that you would retaliate, they would say, "Well, you're not rational, you're crazy."  And so, there was very little effort to intimidate the Gordy family because my dad said all the boys were marksmen, could shoot, and it was a large family and that's verified by an experience I recall when I was about fifteen or sixteen, Berry Gordy's uncle's son was chased by the police for some reason in Detroit.  Now, Jeffries was the mayor at the time.  And he ran home.  Two white officers went into the house, handcuffed him, and dragged him down the stairs.  As they were about to put him in the car, his dad fired one time, and killed an officer.  This is a true--this is a factual story--I remember that story.  And there was a trial and he ended up--I think he was sentenced to Jackson [State] Prison [Michigan State Prison, Jackson, Michigan] for a number of years, not for life, and he eventually got out.  But my dad--I remember that story because my dad always talked about the Gordy family as Berry Gordy, Sr.'s family, as a family that was known in the South that whites were fearful of.  And this was, there were circumstances in which, when there were large families with large numbers of men in it, whites tended--who were aggressive--whites tended to not too much intimidate them because they knew if there was a confrontation, whites would likely die because in most cases when there were lynchings or murders of blacks, whites didn't die.  Whites never paid a price.  And it was blacks who would bear the brunt and the burden of the violence always, um-hm.  That's a part of my dad's recall and lecture about what circumstances were like.  And sometimes, I wonder whether my, or how fully and complete my dad shared those stories with us because, again, his philosophy was, "I didn't want you to grow up hating whites."
Story_ID: 203635
Speaker 1: What people don't understand, and I worked--as you know, I worked for [Reverend Dr.] Martin Luther King, Jr. for a period of time. Martin Luther King, Jr.'s greatest contribution was that he helped blacks deal with fear because fear, as I understood it, as my dad [Thomas J. Green] described it, fear was an ongoing part of your life--not fear for eating, but fear for living, the fear of survival, the fear of angering a white man.  You didn't dare anger a white woman because most of your contact was a white man.  If you angered a white woman, surely you would be lynched, but there was a fear of angering a white man.  So, survival, day-to-day survival in the South was a very serious matter for blacks, especially black men.  So, you were taught and, and your behavior was shaped and modified in such a way that you didn't do the wrong thing.  And that had a carry-over because I recall, as a kid, sometimes I would take the streetcar downtown to Detroit [Michigan] to pay a bill for my mother [Alberta Vinson Green] or father.  And my dad, my--I can remember my dad or my mom's final instruction--don't speak to a white man.  If they speak to you, don't speak to them--keep walking.  So, that had a carry-over to the kind of upbringing that I had as a kid.  And I recall being in downtown Detroit one day crossing the street, and the white policeman said to me, "Nigger, what are you doing downtown?"  And I'd remember what my parents said.  I just ignored him and kept walking, paid the bill, and got the streetcar back home.  So, it was that upbringing in the South that had an impact on how parents reared their kids.  Child-rearing was a very important part of the black community.  So that, that whole, King taught blacks how to deal with that fear that was so much a part of our lives, or part of our parents' lives--the fear of survival, and it allowed whites to deal with guilt.  And two of the serious psychological dynamics are fear and guilt.  Guilt can drive you to do irrational things.  It's like the man who sleeps with his wife's neighbor--I mean, the neighbor, the man who sleeps with his wife's--I mean, his neighbor's wife.  I had it reversed.  And you can do one of two things.  He can later apologize or make amends, mow the lawn, or he could start hating his neighbor because he did something to his neighbor.  There's a guilt--guilt can lead to hate, guilt can lead to remorse, and a form of repentance.
Story_ID: 203636
Speaker 1: Tell me, let's go back to when you were a little kid.  What's your first--do you have an earliest childhood memory?  What was the first thing that you remembered?
Speaker 2: Sure.  Well, the earliest childhood memories that I have was my mother [Alberta Vinson Green] home, at two, home working, sewing, my mother sewed everything.  And I had a tear in my little jacket and I asked her to sew the tear in my jacket.  That's one.  The other, I had my tonsils removed when I was probably--because I had a serious case of tonsillitis, and early, when I was probably three of our years of age.  And I recall my dad [Thomas J. Green] taking me to the hospital.  I remember the ether.  I remember, whatever the recovery room was at, at that time, and I remember my dad dressing me, taking me home.  And I could not--I have to check this--I could not have been more than three or four years of age.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Those are--that was an early memory.
Story_ID: 203637
Speaker 1: What were some of the sights and sounds and the smells of growing up in your neighborhood [in Detroit, Michigan]?
Speaker 2: Cooking.  We grew up in a basically, kind of a black-European community.  By that, there were, there were a few Czechs in the neighborhood.  Religiously, there were Jews in the neighborhood.  And it eventually became overwhelmingly black, which suggests to me that my, when my parents [Thomas J. Green and Alberta Vinson Green] moved in, they moved in into kind of an ethnic-based neighborhood.  I remember Jews, I remember Czechs, I remember Poles living in that community in the neighborhood.  And, eventually, I remember it becoming more and more black--right near the railroad tracks.  The railroad tracks came right through our community.  The sounds--sounds of milk trucks, of ice trucks.  Those days still had horse and wagons.  I can recall the, the stoppers that they, were used to the weight, to hold--make sure the horse didn't take off.  There was statutes bit--I remember that.  I, I have my dad's first ice hooks that I retrieved from my older sister.  I have my dad's lantern that he used.  My dad delivered ice as a young man, and later on delivered coal for Detroit City Ice & Fuel [Company].  So, I remember those sounds and smells.  Smells, usually cooking, and my mom was a good cook.  And my mom knew how to make ends meet in cooking.  So, those were some of the sounds, sights, and smells.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, the neighborhood you grew up in was different from Black Bottom in Detroit [Michigan].  It wasn't the same?
Speaker 2: It was out from Black Bottom, um-hm.  But it was--as I recall, it rapidly became a full black community.  I just remember that some of our neighbors were white.  We called them Europeans during that time.
Speaker 1: Okay.  It's interesting that they, that you remember the ethnicity of the different groups around--
Speaker 2: Uh-hm, Czechs, Poles, and members of the Jewish community.
Story_ID: 203638
Speaker 1: How would you describe yourself as a little kid?  Now, you were one of a large--one brother in a large family--
Speaker 2: There were five boys and four girls.  There were nine of us that lived.  I recall a girl being born after my youngest brother, who died when she--her name was Bernice [ph.], died when she was probably a few months old.  And, and see, I asked my dad [Thomas J. Green] about those deaths.  And I think today, those children would have lived.  The winters in Detroit [Michigan] were very severe, very cold.  And I had a sister, Julia May [ph.], who died of pneumonia, because of the severity of the winter.  And so, my dad described this, that after her death, the babies would sleep in the bed with them until they were old enough and strong enough to survive the strength of the winter, severity of the winter months.  And so, I think that maybe pneumonia probably played a role in the death of the other five.  Maybe premature births might have been a factor.  But there were nine of us that lived, and I was number seven of the nine.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, describe yourself as a little kid.  What kind of a little boy were you and what were you interested in?
Speaker 2: A very active kid.  My mother [Alberta Vinson Green] once told an interviewer, a person who was interviewing me when I was a young Ph.D., that I was the one kid that almost tore the crib down--didn't want to be in a crib, came out of the crib fighting, kicking, very active kid, very much curious, wanting to know, wanting to be with my dad.  My dad was a great storyteller.  My dad was a good musician.  He was a piano player and a guitar player, played in honky-tonks in the South, much to my mother's chagrin after they were married--to make extra money.  So, I was curious, wanting to know.  I was reading early, always wanting to read.  And I had a sister, one sister, for some reason, feed me books to read all through my career.  For example, I recall that when I was probably seven or eight years of age, my sister took me to the Davidson Library [ph.] to listen to a poet read his poems.  The poet's name was Langston Hughes.  And I remember him reading stories about Jim Crow, and describing how bad Jim Crow was.  And, at that time, I had difficulty understanding the meaning of Jim Crow, and I recall asking my sister, why was this Crow so bad?  Why was Jim Crow such a bad person?  And my sister tried to, tried to explain to me the symbolism of Jim Crow, and how Jim Crow was symbolic of race discrimination that blacks were faced.  But he signed the book and I know where that book is today.  I'm going to try to get my hands on it.  My sister's daughter has it, but I went with her that--it was on a Saturday or Sunday at the Davidson Library in Detroit, Michigan.  And so, the people who had information always intrigued me.  W.E.B. Du Bois, I went to hear him speak at Third Baptist Church [Detroit, Michigan] when my son, [R. Vincent] Vince [Green], was three, two years old, I mean.  Vince was a baby.  And I was intrigued by his comments about America and discrimination in America, and how, in many aspects, Europe was ahead of America in terms of its treatment of people of color.  But growing up, I always wanted to know, always wanted to read.  When I was eleven or twelve years of age, I had read both 'Native Son' and 'Black Boy' by Richard Wright.  Again, my sister, Lethia [Green], gave me those books to read.
Story_ID: 203639
Speaker 1: My dad [Thomas J. Green] was a Pentecostal minister, so when I used to travel south with him to the annual Church of God in Christ convention, so I saw discrimination firsthand in the South.  My mother [Alberta Vinson Green] would try to prevent having to seek food by cooking enough food to last us the trip from Detroit [Michigan] to Memphis, Tennessee to the annual Church of God in Christ meetings.  Sometimes, she'd run out of food.  And that's when I can recall my dad going to the back of restaurants, knocking on the kitchen door because in those days, most of the cooks were black. They were black.  And they--when we would knock on the door, they would see us.  They knew what the--the issue was food.  And sometimes they would, they would talk to the owner.  He would allow us to eat in the kitchen.  Sometime they would not--we'd have to take the food out, and eat in the car.  And sometimes, they wouldn't let the cooks give you any food at all.  And that was kind of rare because that was before the protest movement so, and blacks--that status was well-defined.  Growing up, I remember sometimes going with my dad into the black community, seeing the sheriff, and the sheriff always knew when you were out of town--ad out-of-towner. My dad, he knew the southern ways.  My dad knew how to smile and my dad knew how to say "Sir."  And so, we were trying to find the colored community, and the sheriff would direct us there.  And we would sometimes go there and get food--occasionally, maybe spend the night.  In those days, when you were traveling and blacks saw that you're travelers, they took good care of you.  I remember that.  I remember my dad being, always keeping money in his pocket, cash--because that was a route that a lot of the black ministers took.  And the sheriffs knew you were coming.  And I can recall one very specific, one very specific occasion in Tennessee--my dad being stopped by the sheriff.  And my dad was probably traveling through town maybe ten, fifteen miles per hour.  And he was--said, "Boy, you know you're speeding."  And my dad would say, "Yes, sir".  My dad said, "How much do you need?"  He said, "What can you give me?"  And my dad would give him five or ten dollars, and they'd let him go.  So, that was a pattern.  So, I saw this kind of activity growing up, which led me to begin early on, long before I had a Ph.D. and studied psychology, human behavior, to understand the corrupt aspect of America and how that, at the basic level--a local sheriff, shaking down a black minister from the North for five or ten dollars--how basic that is to the later corruption that we saw in America.  I won't talk about Enron [Corporation].
Story_ID: 203640
Speaker 1: Clearly, with activities in the South, and in Detroit [Michigan], and stories from your father [Thomas J. Green].  I mean, you're getting a real clear picture of what's--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, by the time I was twelve, thirteen years of age, I had a clear picture of what it meant to be--in a way, I was not your ordinary black kid because I travelled with my dad. I watched black preachers--many of them were geniuses--in terms of how they took care of and treated their congregation, and how the congregations took care of them.  By the time I was twelve, thirteen years of age, I had worked in an Italian barbershop on Oakton Street shining shoes.  I started working for Max Rosenbloom [ph.] delivery groceries when I was nine years of age in Detroit.  Forty-one [1941] or so, 1941 or so, '31 [1931], '33 [1933], '43 [1943], yeah, about '41 [1941], I was working for a store owner delivering groceries.  I delivered groceries. Italian barber shop and shined shoes in that barbershop, and overheard the language, overheard their views and thoughts about blacks because blacks and Italians lived--Catholic Italians.  It was a large Catholic parish in the area--lived in that area.  And I would hear comments they made about blacks.  And so, a lot of my informal education, which had a tremendous impact on my view of America, shaped my thinking.  And my response to [Reverend Dr.] Martin Luther King, Jr. when, at thirty years of age, twenty-nine or thirty years of age, I think or so, about thirty, he asked me to come work for him.  I was ready--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --because I knew America, from the standpoint of a kid growing up in Detroit, but also travelling to the South.  And I began to understand that northern segregation and discrimination in some respects were similar to that in the South.  And a lot of young blacks didn't understand that--saw the North as a place of freedom.  But my dad's work in a [Ford Motor Company] plant, and later on becoming a self-taught, self-made minister endorsed by the Church of God in Christ, having experiences like the drugstore on the corner of Woodward [Avenue] and Oines [ph.] when I was in high school [Northern High School, Detroit, Michigan], which would not serve us, knowing that the UAW [United Auto Workers Union] in 1942, because I read a lot, was about to pull its national convention out of Detroit because Detroit hotels would not house black delegates.  Those kinds of readings and personal experiences that I had at--in terms of the drugstore--allowed me to begin to understand that discrimination, and the maltreatment and mistreatment, of blacks and other minorities was throughout America.
Story_ID: 203641
Speaker 1: Now, tell us about grade school.  Now, what was the name of your grade school or did you--
Speaker 2: Dwyer, Dwyer Elementary School [Detroit, Michigan].
Speaker 1: Dwyer?  Did you go to--
Speaker 2: D-W-Y-E-R, um-hm.
Speaker 1: --did you go to that one the entire time in elementary school?
Speaker 2: Went from Dwyer to Moore School for Boys [Detroit, Michigan] for one year.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, there's a story there, too.  I know the Moore School for Boys--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, but let's start with Dwyer.  Now, you were at Dwyer from and to what--
Speaker 2: K-, maybe K through 5, kindergarten through fifth grade.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And you spent the sixth grade at Moore?
Speaker 2: I was there for one year.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Moore School for Boys.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, all right, well, tell us about your early education.  I mean, did you like school when you--
Speaker 2: I enjoyed school.  In a lot of ways, schooling, and my contact with boys in the neighborhood, and listening to them left me kind of--I hate to say it--but an angry little kid who controlled his anger.  I was not angry acting out--I controlled it--because, see, as a kid, we were not allowed to go to movies, or later on to dances, or anything like that because my dad's [Thomas J. Green] interpretation of the church was the church forbidded that.  So, I knew that there were kids in the neighborhood going to movies on Saturdays, and we couldn't go.  And they would talk about in school on Monday, and I found that embarrassing.  So, I had a friend by the name of Albert Terhune [ph.], my next door neighbor.  When he would go to the movie on Saturday, I would have him tell me in detail what the movie was about.  So, I went to school on Monday, I could laugh with the other kids.  But I was a good student, I was a good reader.  That was key because reading, even today, is a driving force in the kids' education.  And how did I get to the Moore School for Boys, for boys who were seen as difficult.  A teacher one day slapped me.
Speaker 1: Now, what was it about?  Why did she slap you?
Speaker 2: You know, I was at--I gave a lecture to a group of assistant principals in Detroit [Michigan] last week--about forty.  And they asked me, and I can't remember the answer to that.  But a teacher slapped me, and I had a book in my hand, and the book left my hand and hit her.  How that happened, I don't know, but I was sent to the principal's office and I was, in turn, transferred to Moore School for Boys.  I was there for the year, but I remember clearly being given a test.  It was a Stanford-Binet [Intelligence Scales].  How do I know it was a Stanford-Binet? Because I later trained on that test while working on my master's [degree].  A young white female gave me the Stanford-Binet test, and when I finished, she looked at me.  She said, "You don't belong here."  And I remember her asking me, what did my family do?  And at the time, my brother, Tom [Thomas Green, Jr.], was in medical school.  I mentioned that.  And I had an older brother at Wayne State [University, Detroit, Michigan].  I mentioned that.  And she shook her head and said, "You don't belong here."  And two months later, I was out of there.  That was toward the end of the school year (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now, was--
Story_ID: 203642
Speaker 1: Was Moore [School for Boys, Detroit, Michigan] like a boarding school?  Did you have to stay there?
Speaker 2: No, it was a public school.  They had two there--Jacoby [Day Treatment Center, Detroit, Michigan] for retarded boys, and Moore for acting out--
Speaker 1: Problem youth--
Speaker 2: --problem boys, and I was sent to Moore School and it was--
Speaker 1: The reason why I asked, a lot of schools for problem kids are boarding situations like, you know.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  It was a public school.
Speaker 1: That's what the thing, but it's, it wasn't, so you had a chance to go, you could go home--
Speaker 2: Yeah--
Speaker 1: --afterward, okay.
Speaker 2: --yeah, every day.  And, you know, you just caused me to reflect on something which I had forgotten.  Even before I went to Moore School, I must have had an acting-out problem because they had a classroom for boys only, within Dwyer [Elementary School, Detroit, Michigan], who were problem boys.  And it was never because of academic problems because I was always a fantastic reader and went to the citywide spelling bee and things like that.  But it was for--obviously, it was for acting-out behavior.  And I think, part of it came from the fact that I was aggressive, and our home was a very strict home.  You had to go to church, and you had to get the grades.  We went to church Tuesday nights, Wednesday nights, Friday nights, and all day Sunday, starting at Sunday school, ten o'clock to church at one to four, then dinner, then back.  They call it YPWW, Young People Willing Workers for the Lord and (unclear).  So, we were in church from ten o'clock Sunday to maybe midnight.  And we carried our homework to the church, and there was no excuse for not attending church.  I always tell the story--I'd say, "Dad [Thomas J. Green], I'm sick."  "Well, come to church, we're going to pray for you."  Or, "Dad, I'm tired."  "Well, come to church, you can sleep on the bench," which we slept on benches.  "I got homework."  "Bring your homework; you do it here."  So, it was always--everything centered around church, but that was no excuse for not doing well in school.  And all of my brothers and sisters were--they excelled academically.
Story_ID: 203643
Speaker 1: So, you were at this Moore School [for Boys, Detroit, Michigan] for a year--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and the teacher discovered that you really didn't belong there.  And, but you had to serve the balance of that year out there anyway?
Speaker 2: Year, it was towards the end of the year when this psychologist tested me.  I don't know why they administered an individual intelligence test to me, but they did.  And it was a Stanford-Binet [Intelligence Scales], because I recalled later on being trained on the Binet, and I remember the procedure and the contents of the test.  And then I left there, and I went to Sherrard Intermediate School [Sherrard Junior High School, Detroit, Michigan].  I was at Sherrard for--I guess, for two years or so.  And--
Speaker 1: How do you spell Sherrard?
Speaker 2: S-H-E-R-R-A-D [sic.]--still standing.  From Sherrard, I went to Northern High School [Detroit, Michigan] and spent three years at Northern High School, and four years--nine, grades nine through twelve.  First two years, I kind of didn't work that hard academically because I had outside jobs.  I would work at the bowling alley setting pins until midnight, get home at one, and up the next day going to school.  And so, that kind of--that was my freshman and sophomore years--that kind of tapered off my junior and senior years because I played football, participated in track, and I decided I wanted to go to college.  And I had older brothers in college and I was watching them.  So, my first two years in high school, I didn't do that well, but the last two years, I pointed primarily A's and Bs.  And, based on that, I was able to get into Wayne State [Wayne University; Wayne State University, Detroit, Michigan] part-time.  They wouldn't admit me as a regular student.
Speaker 1: Now, I want to go back (laughter).  We got speeding through, but we'll go back.  Now, you had a brother [Thomas Green, Jr.] in medical school when you were in grade school?
Speaker 2: Tom was in medical school '49 [1949] to '52 [1952], so he--I started high school in '40 [1940].  Let's see--I finished high, I finished high school--wait a minutes, let me get my years straight.  I finished high school in '52 [1952]--'49 [1949] to '52 [1952] in high school.  And he finished medical school, I think, in '52 [1952] or '53 [1953].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, there was an overlap then.
Speaker 1: Was there--
Speaker 2: So, maybe when I was at Sherrard, I said he--I had a brother in medical school.  He might have been pre-med then.  He might--he would have been pre-med then, but he was--he finished Meharry [Medical College, Nashville, Tennessee]--I believe, in '53 [1953], or did he finish in '49 [1949]?
Speaker 1: I guess, what I'm trying to get at is that you weren't at home that much with all this activity.  But you did, you had the benefit on some level, and I guess it depends on how much contact you had with them, of having brothers are really--
Speaker 2: I had a lot of time to have with my brothers.
Speaker 1: --in college, and this is like the first generation in your family to ever go to college.
Speaker 2: Yeah, right.  The--probably the brother I had the closest contact was my oldest one--my brother who's now yet alive, and a minister in Detroit [Michigan]--because he drove a coal truck for Detroit City Ice & Fuel [Company], drove one of my dad's [Thomas J. Green] trucks.  And I worked on a truck with him shoveling coal in the coal bins in northwest Detroit primarily or throughout the city.  And Havious [Green] was a good student.  He got his bachelor's [degree], master's [degree], and a specialist degree, and ended up teaching school in Detroit.

Speaker 1: There was another little interesting quirk in there.  My parents [Thomas J. Green and Alberta Vinson Green] never told us that we could not play sports, but they didn't support it, and they didn't encourage it.  But if we played, they didn't say you couldn't play.  So, I had two experiences.  I remember once being angry with my brother, John [Green].  I felt he had abused me in some way.  I mean, not abusive--that he had mistreated me.  And I saw his duffle bag and I opened it up, and there was a basketball uniform in it.  And I remember taking the basketball--Northwestern High School [Detroit College Preparatory High School at Northwestern, Detroit, Michigan] basketball uniform, and throwing it under the bed--taking out.  Later on, I found out that he was a varsity basketball player and I never knew that.  That was a kind of odd part of our family.  My brother, Havious [Green], was a 440-runner and a miler for Wayne State University [Wayne University; Detroit, Michigan].  How did I find out?  I was in Webster Center [sic. Webster Hall; Mackenzie Hall] at Wayne State one day when I was there as a part-time student, and I saw this picture of the track team on the wall.  I went up and looked at it.  I saw this black in it--it was my brother, Havious.  My brother, Havious, ran track in college.  I never saw him once run track.
Speaker 2: Were they afraid to talk about that at home or--
Speaker 1: You just didn't talk about it.  I was a football, varsity football player.  I remember my sister, Bertha [Green], came to a night game once.  My brother, John, who was in the [U.S.] Army--he was an Army officer--was home on leave.  He came home and watched half of a day game once.  They're the only family members I ever recall coming to a game.  So, you just did your thing sports-wise, but my parents never came to a sporting event that any of us participated in.  My brother, Tom--I don't know if he played any sports.  I know John was a varsity basketball player.  Havious was a track man and a good one at Wayne State.  He had won all kinds of honors.  I never knew that, never knew that.
Speaker 2: And--
Speaker 1: I knew he went to school at Wayne State.
Speaker 2: Now, how did you get involved in varsity football?  I mean, did you--I mean, with all the stuff you're doing as a kid, all the jobs and all that, going to church, how did you find time to play ball?
Speaker 1: Oh, by that time, okay, by the--I stopped going to church by the time I hit high school.  My dad had a philosophy.  My dad always thought it was important to work.  If you had a job, that was an excuse for not going to church.  So, I started working--maybe that was the driving force in working, so I didn't have to go to church.  And so, by that time that my church-going behavior had ceased pretty much by the time I hit high school.  I occasionally would go, but I worked. I worked and played sports.
Story_ID: 203645
Speaker 1: And your father [Thomas J. Green] was--now, he was an assistant pastor or the pastor--
Speaker 2: He was the pastor--
Speaker 1: --the pastor of his own church?
Speaker 2: --own church, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What was the name of the church?
Speaker 2: Church of God in Christ--I don't remember the first part of that, it was the Church of God in Christ.  His first church was at 5409 Hastings Street in Detroit [Michigan] in the black community not far from the Black Bottom.  He had a storefront church, 5409 Hastings.  I remember that.  It was across from the old Superior Laundry.  And then his second church, he bought a house and converted it into a church, and that was 1807 Garfield in Detroit.  And he was there until my brother [Havious V. Green] took over, and my brother started a church in Northwest Detroit, and he's built it.  And he has quite a church, a large church, and a private school facility at the same time in Detroit.
Speaker 1: That's Antioch (unclear)?
Speaker 2: That's Antioch Church of God in Christ.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Church of God.
Speaker 2: It's quite, it's quite a facility and it's growing.
Speaker 1: But that, that wasn't the name of your father's church?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was the Church of God in Christ.  I can't recall the first, the pre-name to it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, had--when you stopped going to church, now had you--and very few people admit to this (laughter), even if it's true, but had you sort of lost some--had religion kind of lost some of its luster to you at that point?
Speaker 2: Oh, it had completely lost its luster.  I--for a long time, I was very anti-church because of the fervor with which my parents were involved in church and in religion, which I now understand.  It was a way to deal with society, the way to deal with discrimination, and a host of other--and I would not go near a church.  And people who are very religious, I was very skeptical of them and especially--I remember as it stands out: Mormons, white.  I went to college with a lot of white males who were Mormons.  And so, I got, I got all the information I could read on the Mormon Church [Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints], like this counsellor, number one counsellor was a man by the name, Brown.  I remember Ezra Benson--[Ezra] Taft Benson, former [U.S.] Secretary of Agriculture, he was a major Mormon.  And I would read about the Mormon faith in order to show them how hypocritical it was because they would not admit blacks to the priesthood.  So, for a while, the--my view of organized religion was not a very good one because I felt that the organized church, especially the white church, was a very significant part of the misery facing black America, and justifying slavery, justifying discrimination later on, and segregation in American life.  I now understand the importance clearly.  Years ago, I wrote an article on being born black and raised in the church.  And I had begun to write about it.  I understood the necessity and the importance of the black church, and the important role they played in the African American community.  Politically, later on, [Reverend Dr.] Martin Luther King, Jr., that was his base, the black church and black ministers fighting segregation, discrimination in America, but it was a social place for blacks.  It was a place of comfort for the African American community--long before we became involved in fraternities and sororities and so forth.  So, yes, I admit that I was very skeptical, and organized religion didn't play a part in my life for some period of time.  But I looked at churches--I began to look at churches as political entities, which they were then, an entity that played a very major role in blacks becoming free.

Speaker 1: What position did you play in football?
Speaker 2: I was a center for a while and I played tackle--I was a tackle.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, you're a pretty good-sized guy then, you played--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I wrestled in college.  In college, I took--that's when I was tall and lean.  And I was wrestling--I was a heavyweight--I wasn't a heavy, heavyweight.  I was weighing about 225 pounds and I wrestled at San Francisco State [College; San Francisco State University, San Francisco, California] because that was a sport I could participate in without having a team--being involved in team practice.  And I took 3rd [place] in the Pacific Coast Conference [PCC] in 1954, '55 [1955], 1955.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I was a pretty good wrestler.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, you lettered in football, you said--
Speaker 2: In high school--
Speaker 1: High school and--
Speaker 2: --and Joe Verducci, who was the football coach, wanted me to go out for football.  He knew I played football in high school.  I told him I had to work--I was working then.  I worked my way all the way through college.  So, he said, "Well, what about wrestling?  You got strong legs."  He taught me how to wrestle. He was my wrestling coach.  He was a football coach and wrestling coach, and I was a pretty good wrestler because I didn't have to involve myself in team sports.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, at Northern [High School, Detroit, Michigan], did you get involved in some of the normal high school, or the, you know, proms and that kind of thing, the--
Speaker 2: No, no--
Speaker 1: --social activity?
Speaker 2: --I played football and I worked, and that was pretty much it.
Story_ID: 203647
Speaker 1: By the time I hit my junior year [at Northern High School, Detroit, Michigan], I was a good student. I was working.  I'd decided I wanted to go to college.
Speaker 2: Okay.  What turned you around?  What made you really focus?
Speaker 1: Brothers and sisters.  I had good role models.  I had two sisters who were nurses.  The other two sisters later on became teachers.  My oldest brother, a teacher; then a brother, a doctor; my brother, John [Green], [U.S.] military man, but he ended up getting a master's [degree], I think, in political science.  He did most of his time in the military as an officer--a colonel, lieutenant colonel.  So, I had older sibs who--I think they played a role.  And my dad's [Thomas J. Green] constant harping--my dad's focus was go to church and get an education.  And my father was a very practical man about religion.  I remember one night, there was a bishop--his name was Cole [ph.].  He preached a sermon at what they call a regional convention, and he said--his theme was you don't need education--you need Jesus, and he preached that.  Vivid memory in the car going home that night, my dad said, "I love the bishop, but he said something tonight I want to reflect on."  He said, "I disagree with the bishop."  He said, "You need Jesus, but you also need education, and education is just as important as Jesus."  That blew my mind.  My dad said that to me--I must have been maybe ten, eleven years of age, but that stuck in my mind.  And so, my father always stressed education, so I had siblings who were educated.  And I think maybe today in terms of grandchildren and great-grandchildren, I doubt if there are any families in American, white or black, that are as credentialed in terms of formal education, as my family and extended family.  I have one brother who has eight girls.  All eight of his girls have either a medical degree or a Ph.D. in a solid area.  I could go on.  I won't talk about it.  I have one son with a Ph.D., who's a space researcher; a son who's a lawyer; a son who's an M.B.A. on the financial side of the entertainment industry.  And they're just normal people in the family.  They don't stand out.  The whole history of the family is like that.  We're a highly educated family, the Green family, based out of Detroit [Michigan], and it's due to that foundation that my dad gave us.  But they also are very much into religion.  I mean, it goes all the way down to a very talented nephew, who just finished his degree at [University of] Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan] in secondary education and music.  He's going to California.  He's playing with Wynton Marsalis.  He plays violin, keyboard.  And so, it goes from music to science to the arts, arts and music, science, humanities. And I have a highly educated family and I won't go into detail.  It would take a while, but it started from Thomas [J.] Green, my dad, and his emphasis on education and religion.  Religion didn't have a total impact, but education did.
Story_ID: 203648
Speaker 1: Did you have any mentors in school?  Did anybody really, in high school [Northern High School, Detroit, Michigan], that really, or grade school, that really pushed you along other than the woman that gave you that test [Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scales] test at Moore [School for Boys, Detroit, Michigan]?
Speaker 2: No, that was a one-time, two-hour experience because she was not a mentor.  I can--I had mentors in college, but I didn't have any--my mentors in grade school or elementary school were sisters and brothers.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My sister, Lethia [Green], who constantly fed me reading material, she--when I wanted to know how babies were born, how did they get started?  My sister, Lethia, who then was a nurse, brought me a book and had me read it, which I could do, and then later on, answer questions that I had about that, about the birth process.  So, it was she--my sister, Lethia, would be a mentor.  My brother, Havious [Green], my oldest brother, was clearly a mentor of mine during the elementary, middle, and high school.  So, I saw what my siblings were doing.  And I was intrigued by the fact that my brother was in medical school--later on, was studying to be a doctor, and then later on, went to medical school [Meharry Medical College, Nashville, Tennessee].  That was rare in those days.  And so, it was a family that was kind of the driving force behind me.  Now, I was the first one to get a Ph.D. in the family.  There are others now who have gotten Ph.D.s, but I was the first one.  But there were others who were going to school, they went into other areas.  My brother went into medicine, and then in teaching, teaching and so forth.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, well, how did you--now, you're in Detroit [Michigan].  Northern High School in Detroit was a pretty good high school in those days?
Speaker 2: It was.  They had some of the same teachers, but they had low expectations for black kids.  And so, there was not a lot of encouragement from our teachers to go on to college, so Northern High School had basically a white teaching force who was there when the school was predominantly white.  And when that school became predominantly black and caught up in other forms of discrimination--busing in black kids from other parts of the city, to keep Northern a black school, and not allowing black kids to go to schools that were near them in Detroit as it did in the South.  They did it more in a more sophisticated way in the North.  Northern--my sister, for example, ended up being a foreign language teacher.  Today, she speaks Arabic, French, and Spanish.  Her high school teacher, who was a French teacher and Spanish teacher, who was my high school Spanish teacher, told her she would never teach a foreign language in the Detroit Public Schools, so don't bother to major in foreign languages.  And my sister ended up at Southwestern High School [Detroit, Michigan].  And she's today, even, she's--let's see, I'm seventy, she's seventy-three.  She's very fluent in Arabic, French, and Spanish.  She was told she'd never teach--and she taught foreign languages for years.  I was not--I can't recall a teacher that pushed me to go on to college.  That push came from my family.
Story_ID: 203649
Speaker 1: How did you conceive of going to San Francisco State [College; San Francisco State University, San Francisco, California]?  How did that happen from Detroit [Michigan]?
Speaker 2: My uncle sent me there.  His name is Sam, Uncle Sam--the [U.S.] military.  I was drafted in the [U.S.] Army and see--one of the many jobs I had, when I did my year and half at Wayne [State University; Wayne University, Detroit, Michigan], I took a test and ended up working at the Detroit city hospital.
Speaker 1: So you went to Wayne State first?
Speaker 2: Uh-hum.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, you really decided to go to Wayne State, so you were at Wayne State?  Okay.
Speaker 2: I was there for a year and a half as a part-time student working nights at the Detroit city and county hospital, but I worked on a psychiatric ward.  I worked on two--the psychiatric ward, the closed ward at night, and I worked in the emergency room.  Those are my two assigned, primary assignments during the--say, roughly year and a half that I was at Wayne.  I worked at the hospital at night, and went to school during the day.  And so, when I was drafted into the military, they needed my M.O. [military occupation].  They needed someone with a background of working in hospitals.  So, I escaped going to Korea [Korean War], and I was shipped to San Francisco [California].
Speaker 1: Now, what year is this when you're, you go to--
Speaker 2: I was drafted in '54 [1954].
Speaker 1: Fifty-four [1954], okay.
Speaker 2: And was out in '56 [1956], and so I did basic training at Fort Knox, Kentucky.  I had post-base training at Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio, Texas.  And that's when they made assignments, and I was sent to San Francisco to work at Letterman Army Hospital [Letterman Army Medical Center, San Francisco, California].  And I worked on the closed psychiatric ward for the balance of my time in the [U.S.] military.  And that's when I met my wife [Lettie Clement Green] and that's how--oh, how did I get to San Francisco State College?  I worked nights.  And it was nothing to do at night, but sleep, because I worked on a ward that housed criminal military offenders, men who had committed crimes, primarily in Korea: rape, murder, what have you.  They were shipped to the United States after their trial overseas, and they were kept there for observation and further screening before being sent to a military prison.  So, we had pretty severe patients there that was seen as severe offenders, and they were locked up a night.  There was nothing to do but sleep, so here I was awake during the day.  And I asked someone if I knew, asked someone if there was a college nearby.  They said, not only a college, but they have what is called, what it was called at that time, TI&E, Troop Information and Education.  I went over there.  I met a lady by the name of Mrs. Goldberg [ph.].  She said, she ran the TI&E, and she told me about San Francisco State.  I went out there and enrolled in school.  They bought my books.  They provided me with tutors and paid my tuition.  She had money.  And so, while I was in the Army there for the roughly twenty-two months, I completed about two years of college.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then I remained at San Francisco State, got my bachelor's degree, and my master's [degree] in psychology, and then went to Michigan State [University, East Lansing, Michigan] where I did my Ph.D.
Story_ID: 203650
Speaker 1: At San Francisco State [College; San Francisco State University, San Francisco, California], did you--was a--Bill Russell had left--
Speaker 2: He went to the University of San Francisco [San Francisco, California].
Speaker 1: He went to San Francisco, okay, different.
Speaker 2: Yeah, just slightly on the other side of town, not quite on the other side of town.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So--
Speaker 2: But it was a good school for black students.  We had--[HistoryMaker] Willie [L.] Brown was a classmate and former mayor of San Francisco [California]; Hiawatha Harris, a noted psychiatrist in Los Angeles [California].  We were all classmates.  When I started San Francisco State, the enrollment there is now about 22, 23,000--it was only eight or nine thousand students there.  I would say black students probably numbered about maybe 250, 300, but we all knew each other pretty much.  And so, you got to know people and more in a very close way because of the small numbers.  To me, it was a much healthier school as I look back than the University of California at Berkeley [Berkeley, California] which was very tough school.  Blacks had a difficult time there.  San Francisco State was a very comforting, good school.  And that's when I first--the seed was planted for me to get a Ph.D. Now, I did have some mentors--people who took me under their wings as an undergraduate and a master's [degree] student at San Francisco State College.
Speaker 1: Who were they?
Speaker 2: There were two:  [Dr.] Henry Clay Lindgren and [Dr.] Jules Grossman, believe it or not, both white males.  And I took a class with Henry Clay Lindgren, and I got the highest grade in his class.  He hired me as a junior or senior undergraduate research assistant, and I did a lot of library research for him.  He wrote a very--one of the best sellers, 'Introduction to Ed Psych' [sic. 'Educational Psychology in the Classroom'], Henry Clay Lindgren, and you'll--if you ever get a copy of it, you'll see my name in it as one of his research assistants.  And the experience with him allowed me to see a different side of life.  There were times--and he paid me as a--he had monies and he paid me for doing research for him.  And I recall that on several occasions, he was busy during the day, and I would go to his home at night in a very nice section near the campus, off Ocean Avenue.  And he had one child, and I was impressed by the home.  He had a baby grand piano and had all kinds of art, carpet--thick carpet.  He spent many of his summers in Europe.  His wife was always very courteous to me.  They would invite me in, have me sit.  And I would share my data and research with him, and he would allow me to look around his home.  And I had never seen a home like that in my life.  It was very--home very rich, with art and culture.  And daughter--a little daughter playing the piano, you know.  So, he, he was the first one to plant the seed.  He said, "You know, you're smart enough to get a Ph.D.".  It was Henry Clay Lindgren who told me that I could get a Ph.D.  I didn't know what a Ph.D. was.  And he said, get Hilgard's book, [Dr.] Ernest Hilgard's book, chapter thirteen, I believe it was, had a chapter in it: "How One Gets a Ph.D."  By that time--and I read the chapter--and they said, to get a Ph.D., you need to have math through calculus.  Well, I was always a terrible math student.  I said, "I could never could have a Ph.D.," and I mentioned that to Lindgren.  He said, "Don't pay any attention to that.  There's much more to getting a Ph.D. than having a math background."  He said, "You can write and you can read.  And you know how to quantify information and data."  So, Henry Clay Lindgren--and I've often thought, I should try to track his family to say thank you to his family.  I'm sure he's deceased because when I was twenty--1920, doing research for him, he had to be in his late fifties, maybe fifty, fifty-five, or so.  But that's one way of saying thank you.  I have often thought that a person like that--I ought to find his family and say thank you to them for the inspiration and the boost he gave me.  He was the one who said, "Bob Green [HistoryMaker Robert Green], you're smart enough to get a Ph.D."  And I was getting good grades.  I, I had good grades and I was getting A's, and I was doing well in psychology.  And Jules Grossman was my advisor, and he and Lindgren--I'm sure they now, as I look back at it, communicated, because they were close.  And he was the other person who supported me at San Francisco State.
Story_ID: 203651
Speaker 1: So, when I finished [San Francisco] State [College; San Francisco State University, San Francisco, California] and when I was about to complete my master's [degree]--I got a master's in school psychology.  I thought I would work for one or two years, and then maybe go to UC Berkeley [University of California Berkeley, Berkeley, California] and get a Ph.D., but I had a very interesting experience.  I was the first black in California to get what they call a pupil personnel services credential, which certified me as a school psychologist, by the State of California.  I was the first black in the State of California to get that degree and to get the certification.  I must have applied to probably fifteen or twenty school districts--I don't know the exact number around the State of California--for a job--and there were openings--as a school psychologist, including the Oakland California School District [sic. Oakland Unified School District] where I did my internship.  And I was told that there were--oh, I first applied for the Oakland job.  And there was a lady by the name of Mary Bradley [ph.]--she was my supervisor.  She told me that the job had been filled--the opening.  Phyllis Regis [ph.], a white female, who was a classmate of mine, told me a month later, "[HistoryMaker] Bob [Robert Green], the job is still open.  Mary Bradley offered me the job."  I went back to Mary Bradley.  She said, "No, the job is not open. It's closed."  Phyllis Regis turned her down and went to Europe and skied for the balance of the year.  She was from a wealthy family.  And I knew then I needed a job, so I remembered driving to San Diego [California] for a job interview, because what I stopped doing--I stopped sending my picture in when I knew what was going on.  And I would tell them, I didn't have a picture, I was getting one done, but I'd get the interview without the picture.  And I would go in, and they would see I was black, and I couldn't get the job.  San Diego [California], San Francisco [California] unified school district, the Oakland [California] school district, Berkeley [California] school district--probably fifteen school districts all turned me down.  So, I said, "I need a job."  So, I said, "I know what I'll do.  I'll continue to go to school," so I applied to Michigan State [University, East Lansing, Michigan], the University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan], and Wayne State [University, Detroit, Michigan] because they were near my home, and the University of Arizona [Tucson, Arizona].  And I was admitted to four schools.  One school put me on the wait list--that was the University of Michigan.  But I saw the housing at Michigan State and it was brand new, good housing, so I selected Michigan State because it was near home.  So, I always say that maybe I wouldn't have gotten a Ph.D.  Maybe that was one of the benefits of discrimination, that--I might have eventually got one at Berkeley.  I don't know.  Berkeley was a tough school at that time, but Michigan State accepted me, and to the Ph.D. program, and I got a Ph.D. in two and a half years.
Speaker 2: So, it was 1963 when you got a Ph.D.
Speaker 1: I finished in December of '62 [1962].  The degree was awarded in March of '63 [1963], yes.
Speaker 2: Okay.  And you got the master's from San Francisco State?
Speaker 1: Both bachelor's [degree] and master's.
Story_ID: 203652
Speaker 1: How did you meet your wife [Lettie Clement Green]?  We need to get into that.
Speaker 2: I was--my wife tells me that she was at San Francisco State [College; San Francisco State University, San Francisco, California] as a student.  She transferred to nursing school at Mt. Zion Hospital [UCSF Medical Center at Mount Zion] in San Francisco [California].  And she came out to visit her friends on the day she had off, and she asked them if there was anybody--any guys, new guys on campus.  And she said, I was walking across the campus, and the girl said, "That guy right there, he's new," and that was me.  And, actually, it was my brother-in-law who worked--he was in the [U.S.] military, he worked nights with me.  My wife needed a date and he said, "I know a guy who's a nice guy," and he introduced the two of us.  And she later on told me I was the same guy she saw walking across campus.  And she was the only one I ever really dated and because--well, I always worked, didn't have a girl, liked girls, but didn't really have a girlfriend because I worked.  And her family took a liking to me.  They thought I was a nice guy.  And they would have me over and feed me, and her father would call me "Son," and I didn't realize that was a short for son-in-law.  And so, we ended up going together and getting married, um-hm.  It was just like that--it, it was--and we've been married forty-eight, going on forty-nine years.  She's a nurse, and she's the mother of my three sons, and we've been close for all those years.  And she--we, I did not want my wife to work.  I wanted her--and which is really--was a chauvinistic attitude, which I candidly today admit on camera, but I wanted my wife and I wanted my sons to have the kind of secure home that I didn't always feel.  My dad [Thomas J. Green] was a good provider in terms of food, protecting the family, but you never felt just secure there because you had to work, you had to do this.  There were these conditions and I didn't want those conditions on my three sons.

Speaker 1: It was Yellow Cab [Co.].
Speaker 2: Yellow Cab, all right.
Speaker 1: I was the first African American to hit the streets driving a Yellow Cab in San Francisco [California].  There was a boycott--the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] was boycotting Yellow Cab.  And a man by the name of Granville Jackson [ph.] at the time was instrumental in the leadership because Yellow Cab would not hire blacks.  Well, the two blacks I was close at the time was [HistoryMaker] Willie [L.] Brown who was--I think a first or second year law student at [University of California] Hastings [College of the Law, San Francisco, California], the University of California law school, and Lewis Davis [ph.], who was my college roommate, who had a college degree from Huston-Tillotson College [Huston-Tillotson University, Austin, Texas] in the--science.  There was also one in San Francisco State [College; San Francisco State University, San Francisco, California]--taking additional science courses to become a doctor.  The three of us agreed to be the front people for the NAACP to apply for the job.  So, we went down and applied for a job at Yellow Cab, and they gave us a test.  It was something like a ten item, verbal test--easy, easy test that any fifth grader could pass.  Willie Brown, who was a law student at [University of California] Berkeley [Berkeley, California]; I was an undergrad excellent student at San Francisco State; Lewis Davis--all three of us flunked the test--a ten item, verbal test like apple, orange, and pear, and a truck are clustered together--what doesn't belong there?  The truck doesn't belong there.  And we flunked that test.  So, we protested, took the test again, and we passed it.  They tell us we'd finally passed it.  So, then they sent us to the union hall, and the union wouldn't take us in, so it was the union.  And, finally, after the boycott caved in, they hired Willie Brown, Lewis Davis, and myself.  Willie never drove because he didn't have to do anything to do with driving a Yellow Cab.  Louis Davis took the night shift, and I took the afternoon shift, so I was the first black to hit the streets.  And then, eventually, we both ended driving afternoon and nights.  And it was quite an experience for me, too, seeing the streets at night, seeing the streets of San Francisco at night, which was even then a very much a tourist town.  And whites would have--I'd meet, I would meet all kinds of whites.  But one thing that experience taught one is that the white community, like the black community, and all communities are very diverse.  You find very open-minded--I ran into hostility because I was black, and I ran into great support.  For example, I remember one night picking up a medical doctor who had--was in San Francisco on a vacation with his wife and three or four kids.  He needed some medicine for a kid.  And I drove--I knew where a pharmacy, all-night pharmacy was.  I drove him to the pharmacy, he got the medicine, drove him back to the hotel.  He gave me, and he found out I was a student, and he talked to me.  He--I think he gave me a thirty dollar tip.  I mean, thirty dollars, in those days, that was just unbelievable.  I always carried my books on the seat of my cab, and when the bars were closed at two in the morning, you'd be busy till about three.  Well, you'd have a lull from three to five until people would be getting cabs to go to work the next morning.  And people would see books, as many a white and sometimes blacks, but mostly whites, would see those books and ask me if I was a student.  I'd say, "Yes."  "Oh, you're going to school?"  "Yes."  "Are you married?"  "Yes, I'm married, I have a little boy."  That always led to a nice tip.  And then, there were whites who wouldn't get in your cab because you were black.  I remember one night pulling up to the [Westin] St. Francis Hotel [San Francisco], and two women who were about to get in my cab.  And one looked in and say, "He's black, we can't, he's colored, we can't get in."  The other one say, "He looks okay--let's get in."  You know, things like that so it, it allowed me to understand that there's diversity in communities.  You can't lump all people together.  And so, the cab experience was very educational for me, very educational, and the tips were good.  I would leave home some nights--my wife [Lettie Clement Green] would scrape up a dollar's worth of change for me to make change for the first cab.  And I might come home with fifteen, twenty dollars in tips.  Well, that would buy groceries for us.  So, I drove a taxi in San Francisco.  I delivered--I drove an egg truck, too, for a period of time.  I delivered eggs up and down Market Street.  So, wherever there was a job, I would go and work.  I worked for my brother-in-law who cleaned bars.  He was a janitor at a janitorial service.  I mentioned I delivered eggs.  Oh, I worked at juvenile court for a while as, as a--they call it group counsel.  We were really orderlies, kept the boys on line in--I mean, in tow in San Francisco.  I had a variety of jobs, but the taxi cab job was the most significant one.

Speaker 1: Story about my wife [Lettie Clement Green]: my wife had an interesting experience when she was a senior nursing student at Mt. Zion Hospital [UCSF Medical Center at Mount Zion] in San Francisco [California].  She was on duty one afternoon, and she was working in the newborn baby section of Mt. Zion Hospital.  And while on duty, she noticed a lady walking by in a hurry that appeared to have a baby in her arms, and my wife got a good look at her face.  And the lady left the floor and left the hospital.  Turned out the baby [Robert Marcus] was the son of Dr. [Sanford] Marcus, a prominent San Francisco physician, who was on staff at Mt. Zion Hospital.  And that was the Marcus baby, the famous Marcus baby kidnapping.  And it was my wife's description--it was--my wife was on duty.  It was her description of the baby that allowed the detectives and the police to finally locate the woman [Betty Jean Benedicto] and the baby after two or three days.  And my wife's picture was on the front page of either the San Francisco Chronicle--probably both--and the San Francisco Examiner with her telling her story.  My wife, I believe, felt very badly about it, felt that she was probably responsible for not stopping the lady even though it happened so fast she really didn't realize what was going on, and that was the story that she didn't want me to talk about for years.  But I felt that, that was another part of the strength of my wife, Lettie, as a person in raising my three sons--the fact that she was able to stand strong during that experience.  And her steady, careful, descriptive behavior led to the capture of the lady.  I would guess if the Marcus baby is still alive, he is probably about fifty-five or so years of age.

Speaker 1: You went to Michigan State [University, East Lansing, Michigan] in 19--
Speaker 2: I was there from '60 [1960] to '63 [1963] as a [doctoral] student.
Speaker 1: As a student, okay.
Speaker 2: So, to December '62 [1962]--'63 [1963], I went on the faculty at Michigan State.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what was your experience like at Michigan State?  You said that the living facility was one of the attractions--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --at Michigan State, but what other--
Speaker 2: I had the support as a graduate student.  I had great opportunities to teach.  I had good teachers, good instructors, and good support.  The town itself was very discriminating.  You knew that in East Lansing [Michigan], there was some forms of discrimination.  I learned more about it after I finished my Ph.D., in our efforts to buy a home, but the campus was a fairly safe, fairly secure place.  There was some discrimination on campus.  For example, in the [student] union building where they had a barber cutting hair, blacks couldn't get a haircut.  I don't think blacks really wanted the barber to cut their hair after one experience.  But the campus, considering the times, was a fairly comfortable place.  There were forms of discrimination that did exist, however, and especially stronger forms of discrimination that existed in the town of East Lansing.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, you finished your Ph.D. in '60--well, you got (unclear) in '63 [1963], but you finished in '62 [1962]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And I have a note here that you worked for U.S. (unclear) in Chicago [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: I was a consultant to the government and the government program was--there was a program based in Chicago that I served as an evaluator of.  The other--and there were two other Chicago experiences I had.  I was an expert for the Chicago School Board [sic. Chicago Board of Education] and really worked for Judge Schwartz [ph.], Judge Schwartz, during that desegregation case there.  And then, I provided the leadership for the building of an educational structure of a set of components related to the desegregation plan.  In other words, along--
Speaker 1: In Chicago, now, this is, this relates, this goes back to the Willis Wagon controversy and all that in Chicago where they were trying to get, they were trying to get better school facilities for black children in the--
Speaker 2: Yes, and it was during the desegregation days.  And there was a community called the Bogan [Chicago, Illinois] community that was very resistant to desegregation and led the fight against it.  But I was brought in by the school district with the approval of the court to develop an educational component plan to be associated with the busing program.  That was one experience.  The second experience--third experience I had with the City of Chicago--after I left [Reverend] Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] formally to return to Michigan State, he asked me if I would try to design a reading program for disadvantaged blacks in the South Side of Chicago, I believe--
Speaker 1: West Side probably.
Speaker 2: --West, West Side.
Speaker 1: That's where he stayed when he was--
Speaker 2: The West Side of Chicago, I'm sorry.  And I can't, offhand, quickly think of the name of the community.  I wrote a proposal that was funded by the federal government to set up a reading tutorial program in the City of Chicago.  And I have a picture, which I'll show you, of me attending a conference with Dr. King in which he announced the funding of the program.  Mayor [Richard J.] Daley, who did not want Dr. King in Chicago, found out about it--put pressure on [President] Lyndon Baines Johnson.  And Lyndon Baines Johnson directed the Office of Education [sic. U.S. Department of Education] to cancel that program.  So, the reading program was cancelled politically.  I did get it started.  I had people working with me in Chicago, but the money dried up quickly.
Speaker 1: That's really stunning.  It sounds like, you know, it sounds like some of that, you know--
Speaker 2: Mayor Daley, Daley, Sr.--
Speaker 1: Like what happened but--
Speaker 2: --was a very powerful man in the Democratic Party, much more so than--he was a power-broker--than his son [Mayor Richard M. Daley] is today as Mayor of Chicago.  And he picked up the phone on a weekend and called the president of the United States, who directed the head of the office of education in Washington, D.C. to cancel that program--it was cancelled on Monday.  And I was a part of that.
Speaker 1: That's (unclear), yeah.
Speaker 2: And I have records on that.
Story_ID: 203656
Speaker 1: Let me backtrack a little bit to Michigan State [University, East Lansing, Michigan].  Now, did you have any, in terms of working on your Ph.D. over there, did you have--was there a particular mentor over there or anyone who was like a--
Speaker 2: Probably the closest academic mentor I had was a man by the name of [Dr.] William [W.] Farquhar.  He was my major advisor, F-U-Q-U-H-A-R.  And Farquhar, F-A-R-Q-U-H-A-R, Bill Farquhar was my major professor.  And he was a mentor, and we worked closely together during my Ph.D.  We published an article together after I completed my Ph.D.  And then my career kind of took off because, you know, being one of maybe three blacks on the faculty at Michigan State, I was well-known.  The students knew me, students came to me.  And my career took off.  And primarily in terms of writing in my field, but also it took a slightly different, and went in two different directions.  There was discrimination in town.  And blacks couldn't buy a home in town, so I became very much a serious part of the effort to desegregate East Lansing [Michigan].  I filed suit against realtors in East Lansing and one made a case.  My lawyer, who worked for the state civil rights commission [Michigan Civil Rights Commission], is now a prominent U.S. Senator.  His name is Senator [Carl] Levin from Michigan.  He was, at that time, a lawyer with the civil rights commission.  And he became my attorney, defended me, and won his first major case with the commission, suing a realtor in East Lansing, Michigan.  So, he played a role in opening up that town, but East Lansing was a very discriminating community.  [HistoryMaker] Ernie [Ernest] Green, out of Washington, D.C. with Lehman Brothers, he and I were--I was slightly ahead of him as a student--but he was also involved with the campus NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] in their fight to desegregate the campus--I mean the community.
Speaker 1: Now, he was one of the original Little Rock Nine, right?
Speaker 2: One of the Little Rock Nine, right, from [Little Rock] Central High School [Little Rock, Arkansas].  And, as a matter of fact, even today, we're close friends.  But so, in a way, I was a strong young professor academically, writing articles.  I started on completing my first book.  But at the same time, I became known locally, and then nationally because of my efforts to lead to end discrimination in East Lansing.  Added to that, I organized, with the support of two of my colleagues, a proposed boycott of the Big Ten Athletic Association because they would not hire any black officials.  And it was our proposed boycott which led to the first hiring of officials in the Big Ten.  Ryan Kissner [ph.], who was working for Jet magazine at the time, covered that in detail.  But the record will show that it was our leadership that led to the hiring of the first athletic officials in major college basketball, which later on began to have an impact on professional sports as well.
Speaker 1: What year was that, that you all got the boycott to place--
Speaker 2: Probably about '72 [1972].
Speaker 1: Seventy-two [1972], okay.  That's a little bit further down.
Speaker 2: Wayne Duke was a Big Ten, Wayne Duke was a Big Ten commissioner at the time.  And I got some blackout lists from Michigan State, from Indiana [University, Bloomington, Indiana], from [University of] Illinois [Urbana-Champaign, Illinois], from [University of] Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan], to go to Chicago [Illinois] with me.  And we said, "If there's not Big Ten officials at the opening of ball--football in the fall," fall of, I think it was '70 [1970], '72 [1972], I said, "the black athletes are going to walk off the field and not play."  They didn't take a chance.  And so, they ended up, as I remember, we had one official, black official, at the game at Michigan State.  So, those were some very tense, difficult times.  So, wherever I found--and I published an article on that--wherever I found discrimination, and when I was able to do so, I would--I confronted it, and begin to write about it.  So, you'll see, if you look at my long, the long version of my resume, you'll see that my books, my articles, and referee journals all center on some form of race, class--or class discrimination, or ways to end it.
Story_ID: 203657
Speaker 1: What was your dissertation about? And (unclear)--
Speaker 2: It was a dissertation on motivation, achievement motivation.  I tested out the efficacy of an instrument to predict how black students, boys and girls, would achieve in high school.  The predictive validity of this instrument was tested.  And I found that the strongest single predictor of how a kid would do in high school for black males was self-concept--how they viewed themselves.  The strongest predictive for black females was their achievement test scores and self-concept.  The black males was primarily self-image.
Speaker 1: Now, did you--having spent time in the [San Francisco] Bay Area [San Francisco, California], did you have any contact there with [HistoryMaker Dr.] Price Cobbs or William [Ezra] Greer and--
Speaker 2: They were all not known then and probably just a few years older than me.  The most prominent person I had contact was [Dr.] Carlton [B.] Goodlett.  My wife was his nurse for a period of time.
Speaker 1: He's a newspaperman of the--yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he owned the Sun-Reporter.  And he gave me gas money to get back to Michigan, Michigan, because my wife [Lettie Clement Green] worked for him for about three years.  He was a strong political leader and an outstanding scholar.  Carlton Goodlett did his Ph.D. under Toles [ph.], T-O-L-E-S, one of the most outstanding experimental psychologists in the academic world nationally and internationally.  And if my memory serves me correctly, Carlton Goodlett finished his Ph.D. at twenty or twenty-one, and then went down to Meharry [Medical College, Nashville, Tennessee] and got his M.D., but he also taught psychology over at Fisk [University, Nashville, Tennessee]   while working on his Ph.D.  So, he was a motivating factor, but he knew I had an interest in psychology.  He pushed me to go out and get my Ph.D.  He was an influence in my life.  And Kenneth [B.] Clark was also an influence in my life about getting the Ph.D.  But Carlton Goodlett helped when I--just as I was leaving to drive out of the city, I think he gave me two hundred dollars for gas, and had me stop off in Omaha, Nebraska and spend a night with his dad.  He was--Carlton Goodlett was a strong motivating force.  Price Cobbs and Greer, those men had not really reached any prominent level at all at that time.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: And I did not know them.
Speaker 1: And [HistoryMaker] Nathan Hare wasn't out there at that time?
Speaker 2: No, he was much later.
Story_ID: 203658
Speaker 1: See, when I finished my Ph.D. in psychology, it's educational psychology in the spring of--was awarded spring '63 [1963].  You could count the black psychologists on your hands, probably maybe nationally ten, fifteen--at most, twenty probably.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now, I wanted--is it time to talk about [Reverend] Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] and how you got involved with SCLC [Southern Christian Leadership Conference]?
Speaker 1: Sure.
Speaker 2: You have not had--had you been--I--well, I suppose you had been following the Civil Rights Movement and knew--were well aware of what is--
Speaker 1: Oh, yes, I--the--I remember two distinct days.  I remember May 17th, 1954, the day of the [Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954] [U.S.] Supreme Court decision, I was working on that closed psychiatric ward, when it was flashed on TV in San Francisco [California].  And Lindsay Thompson [ph.], a white male from Georgia, told me the schools would never be integrated in America, and looked like he's just about right, 'cause we've gone through the cycle and re-segregated again.  I remember that.  I also remember watching Dr. King lead protest marchers in Alabama.  I watched the news religiously every day.  I was following that.  I met him in 1955.  In 1955, the National NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] had its convention in San Francisco and Dr. King was the keynote speaker.  I was driving my Yellow Cab that night and, in those days, we have to wear uniforms and caps.  We had jackets and caps.  He was speaking at the Civic Center [San Francisco California] and I, and I parked my cab in back of the Civic Center, took off my cap and my jacket, walked in, and sat just as he got up to speak.  And I was spellbound.  When he finished speaking, I worked my way through the audience, and I remembered bumping past Mahalia Jackson.  And I went up to him and I got in his face and I shook his hand.  I said, "Dr. King, I'm so proud of you.  My name is [HistoryMaker] Bob [Robert] Green."  And I went out and got in the cab and kept driving.  Two months later, I heard that he was speaking at a breakfast in Berkeley, California to a group of Alphas.  And I was a member of the [Alpha Phi Alpha] Fraternity, so I got myself a ticket, and I went to that breakfast meeting where he spoke.  And I went up to him--he looked at me, and I shook his hand again, and I said, "I heard you at the Civic Center speak at the NAACP Convention.  My name is Bob Green."  Michigan State [University, East Lansing, University], we were organizing various, various movements to raise money for the South and to support Martin Luther King, Jr.  And we finally decided we wanted to do a summer program at one of the southern schools.  We picked Rust College in Holly Springs, Mississippi.  And I think we picked Rust because I knew, had known a Dr. [William A.] McMillan, and I knew how segregated Rust College was.  So--I mean, how the community on Rust was segregated.
Speaker 2: Holly Springs, yeah.
Speaker 1: So someone said, "Why don't we get Martin Luther King, Jr. as a speaker?"  He--this is shortly after the Selma movement, Selma, Alabama movement [Selma to Montgomery Marches].  And I was asked to contact him, so I called down there and just so happened, there was a young lady who answered the phone whom I went to college with.  Her name was Edwina Smith, and she did help do a lot of Dr. King's bookings.  And she arranged for him to come to Michigan State and speak.  That was probably 1957, maybe '6 [1956].  I went to work for him in '56 [1956].  So, it might have been 1965--I don't think my year is right.  Did I say '50 [1950]?  It wasn't '50 [1950].
Speaker 2: Yeah, you said '65 [1965].
Speaker 1: Yeah.  It was '65 [1965].
Speaker 2: This was after Selma, you say?
Speaker 1: Yeah, Selma had occurred.
Speaker 2: Okay, yeah.
Speaker 1: And went to check--
Speaker 2: This was after they marched from Selma to Montgomery [Alabama]?
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, we have to check those dates.
Story_ID: 203659
Speaker 1: I arranged for him [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] to come and speak at Michigan State [University, East Lansing, Michigan].  And I remember I brought him to the office.  He had a sore throat, he was tired.  And a man by the name of--a young man, Bernard Lee, was with him.  He spoke to a packed audience.  And when he finished speaking, he said, "You know what?"  He had spent--I had spent most of the afternoon with him.  He said, "Have you ever thought about leaving the university, just for a short time, getting a good experience working in the South?"  I said, "Not really, but," I said, "I'd love to work for you."  He said, "Why don't you come and work for me?"  And he left it.  And I received a call about a month later from a man by the name, known by the name of Andrew Jackson Young [HistoryMaker Andrew Young], who later became an ambassador, a congressman, and mayor.  He called me and asked me to drop--consider coming to Atlanta [Georgia] to work, if I was ever in the South, drop by to visit with him.  Well, I had just gotten a small contract for forty-five hundred dollars from the federal government to identify possible Job Corps camps in Georgia, Alabama, and Florida.  And I made sure I went through Atlanta.  And I went through Atlanta and I had dinner with Andrew Young at his home on Chickamauga [Lake, Tennessee], and he formally pushed me again to come work for Dr. King.  And I met Dr. King on that trip again.  And so, I asked Dr. King to write me a letter so I'd have something to show to the university.  So, he wrote me a letter asking me to consider leaving Michigan State, taking leave--not to quit my job--to work with him for a year or two.  I, in turn, took the letter to Dr. John [A.] Hannah, our president, who was head of the U.S. Civil Rights Commission at the time.  And Dr. Hannah didn't want me to leave.  It just so happens that Roy Wilkins was brought to campus to speak by Dr. Hannah.  And I sat in the front row, and when Roy Wilkins finished speaking and the program was concluded, Dr. Hannah came off the stage, grabbed me by my hand, pulled me up on the stage, and said to Roy Wilkins, "Mr. Wilkins, this young man has been offered a job by Martin Luther King, Jr."  And I said, "It was just for a short time"--said, "tell him that his place is here."  And Roy Wilkins--I'll never forget--he said to me, "Young man, you should stay here at Michigan State University, and keep teaching these white kids that race really isn't important.  You don't need to work for Martin Luther King, Jr."  Well, I made up my own mind.  I went to work for Dr. King, and it was the best decision I've ever made in my life.  And it had a permanent and lasting effect on my view of the world, my view on the diverse, diversity of people, diversity of groups, of people, the impact of poverty, politics, people I met, like Fannie Lou Hamer, who took us to see the plantation that she worked on: experiences I never would have had.
Story_ID: 203660
Speaker 1: When I returned with [Reverend] Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.]'s blessings to Michigan State [University, East Lansing, Michigan], I continued to work with him part-time, free of charge, I would have organized events, fundraisers, I would go South in March with him, even after I had left and returned to the university.  I was a principle person in the [James] Meredith March Against Fear.  I provided the leadership, along with Hosea Williams, for SCLC [Southern Christian Leadership Conference].  There was Herb Callender [Herbert Callender] of CORE [Congress of Racial Equality]--I meant, sorry, I provided the leadership for SCLC--did I say the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]?
Speaker 2: No, SCLC.
Speaker 1: SCLC, okay.  The NAACP didn't participate in the March Against Fear.  There was some disagreement with King and Roy Wilkins at the time.  The Urban League, under Whitney Young, did participate, but it was primarily myself; Herb Callender, of course; Stokely Carmichael [Kwame Ture]; and Hosea Williams that provided the leadership for that march.  We marched from Hernando, Mississippi where Meredith was shot to Jackson [Mississippi].  It was about--
Speaker 2: This was the march that occurred after Meredith had been shot at the other march, right?
Speaker 1: This was the march after he had gone to Ole Miss [University of Mississippi, Oxford, Mississippi], and he graduated from Ole Miss, and he began to lecture on fear in Mississippi.  And he said, "I'm going to demonstrate that you need not be afraid of Mississippi.  I'm going to march from the edge of Mississippi, as you leave from Memphis [Tennessee] going into Mississippi to Jackson [Mississippi]."  He was shot in Hernando.
Speaker 2: Okay, so he was shot on that march, the March Against Fear?
Speaker 1: He was shot on the march; he was shot on that march.  And it was at that time that Dr. King said we need to pick the march up and complete it.  King did provide that kind of leadership and, you know, along the way, there was different philosophy, different philosophies--non-violence on the part of King.
Speaker 2: Were you near James Meredith when he was shot in--
Speaker 1: No, when he was shot, I was--we were in a staff meeting in Atlanta [Georgia].  Dr. King had us--I think it was a Monday staff meeting or a weekly staff meeting, and someone came in and said that Meredith was shot.  Dr. King said we need to get over to see him right away.  So, I went on a plane with Dr. King, Andy Young [HistoryMaker Andrew Young], and Hosea Williams, and [HistoryMaker Reverend] James Bevel.  We all went to the hospital and visited Meredith.  And Dr. King told James Meredith that we would pick the march up, that SCLC would pick the march up.  He invited CORE to join, and the Urban League to join, and the NAACP to join.  And the NAACP was the only organization that refused to formally participate in that march.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So, my work with Dr. King was very rich and very rewarding.  It, it allowed me to understand the politics of race, the insanity of race, the psychology of race.  It allowed me to understand that race was a significant product of every institution of American life, the church, our public schools, our private schools, colleges, and universities.  I began to understand that there was no aspect of American life in which race had not manifested itself, and was, and not intertwined with, including families, neighborhoods, and communities, government.
Story_ID: 203661
Speaker 1: You were talking about all the--what you learned about American race working with [Reverend] Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.].  But I know there are a couple--there's one incident that I heard about where you were in a car with Dr. King, and Bernard Lee, and I think, [HistoryMaker] Andrew Young?
Speaker 2: James Belk.  That was in--
Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker Reverend] James Bevel?
Speaker 2: Belk--
Speaker 1: Belk.
Speaker 2: James Belk owned the gas station.
Speaker 1: Right.  Well, tell that story from the beginning.
Speaker 2: We were in a car--and was it Grenada [Mississippi] or Natchez [Mississippi]?
Speaker 1: What year is it, too?  Let's give us a perspective?
Speaker 2: That was the year I returned to Michigan State [University, East Lansing, Michigan] or that was in '66 [1966]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --fall, and I was (unclear)--so I mean fall of '66 [1966].  We were--it was the opening of school, and we were there to assist parents in staying strong under the segregation of those schools.  And I believe it was Natchez--it was Natchez or Grenada.  I've got it in my notes--Natchez.  And we pulled up to a Texaco station.  Dr. King--in the front of the car was Coretta [Scott] King's cousin, Obie [ph.] was driving--not Obie--well, anyway, Coretta King's cousin was driving.  And Dr. King was on the right side, front seat.  In the back was Andrew Young, myself, and Bernard Lee who had travelled with Dr. King.  And we always tried to get Dr. King to sit in the back of the car in the middle where he'd have more protection.  And he would never, never do that.  And so, we pull up to the light, and--it was Grenada.  James Belk, owner of the gas station, saw Dr. King.  He was pumping gas.  He stopped pumping gas.  He walked up to the car, pulled out his pistol, and put it up to Dr. King's temple.  Why Bernard, why the driver, Obie--Obie was his name--didn't take off--I don't know--but everybody froze.  He said, "Martin Luther King, Jr., you so and so, and so and so, I'm going to blow your f-ing brains out."  Dr. King very calmly turned to him and said, "Brother, I love you."  And that pistol came down.  Well, of course, we all were at--probably had heart attacks in all four chambers, and we were pretty put out.  See, it was-"Dr. King, we told you, you should ride in the back, you should ride in the back of the car.  Look what happened."  He very calmly turned to us and said, "Look, [President] John Fitzgerald [Kennedy] had the [U.S.] Army, the [U.S.] Navy, the [U.S.] Air Force, the [U.S.] Coast Guard, and the Secret Service, and they assassinated him.  When they're ready for me and my time comes, I'm gone." I remember that incident.  That was his response.  The other thing that I remember was a meeting of the [Mississippi] Freedom Democratic Party [MFDP] in Chicago [Illinois] where Dr. King spoke.  We were on our way to Washington, D.C. where he gave the keynote address at the American Psychological Association's [APA] meeting.  He had been invited by [Dr.] Kenneth [B.] Clark and Tom Petty who would speak there, and I was traveling with him.  And, matter of fact, my wife [Lettie Clement Green] was with us during that time.  And there was a lot of shouting at Dr. King by so-called liberals, liberal blacks, and radical blacks, and liberal whites that non-violence is not going to work and why are you pressing non-violence on us?  We need to, you know, be more militant in our stance against segregation.  Some, some even talked about taking up arms against segregation in America, which came to have nothing to do with.  And the next day--I mean, they shouted him down and it was, he was visibly annoyed by it, not shaking fearful.  In the plane the next day on our way to Washington, D.C., he said, and I heard him say this to Andy Young and myself, "There's really only one place I really feel comfortable speaking today.  And we said where?"  He said, "In the black church in the South," and that's where he was assassinated while getting ready to go speak at a black church in the South.  He was going to speak at the Church of God in Christ [Mason] Temple in Memphis [Tennessee].  That's where he was shot.  So, King had--he was never afraid, but there was a growing awareness that he could be a target for assassination and we all worried about it.
Story_ID: 203662
Speaker 1: Did he [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] seem worried himself about-I mean, you--
Speaker 2: Not, not, not fearful to the extent--I think the thing that worried King was the constant harassment that he received from the FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation] and, namely, J. Edgar Hoover.  It was well-known that J. Edgar Hoover had tremendous hatred, hatred for King.  There's a famous picture, John Fitzgerald and Kennedy standing-[President] John Fitzgerald Kennedy standing in the [White House] Rose Garden [Washington, D.C.] almost nose to nose talking.  What happened, there was a meeting at the White House in which King, Andy Young [HistoryMaker Andrew Young], Bernard Lee, and [HistoryMaker Reverend] Walter Fauntroy went with Martin Luther King, Jr. to press Kennedy to push for a greater political effort to end discrimination, maybe a public accommodations act in the South.  And Kennedy didn't feel he could get it through.  He kept asking for more time from Dr. King--never said no.  I just need more time, more strength politically, to get a public accommodations act, and a voting rights act passed.  When the meeting ended, Andy Young told me the story.  The president, President Kennedy, said I want to speak to you privately.  So, they went out into the back, to the Rose Garden, and there's this famous picture of the two of them standing together talking.  And they talked for about fifteen minutes.  When it ended and they were in a car heading back to the apartment that they were staying at in Washington, D.C., Andy Young and Walter Fauntroy asked him, asked Dr. King, "What was all that about?"  He said, "Oh, don't worry"-said, "it was the president telling me about J. Edgar Hoover and telling me to watch my step, that Hoover was watching me, and that he was not feeling favorably towards me."  In other words, he was not his friend.  He said, "Watch your behavior, watch Hoover."  And we know the story.  When Andy Young was in [U.S.] Congress, I was in his office one day, and Andy had a stack of boxes yea high.  It was the FBI file on Dr. King, probably as much as he could get.  I spent that day in that office going through the file.  They harassed him, they watched him.  As a matter of fact, they made up lies on him.  They did the same with Andrew Jackson Young.  Andy Young probably has never told this incident publicly, and I hope he won't mind me saying it, but Andy shared with me the fact that he and Jean [Childs] Young, his wife at the time--Jean is now deceased--were on a trip in New York.  Well, the FBI sent her a letter, sent her, rather, a hotel bill with Andrew Young's signature on it, showing that he had stayed in the hotel with a woman in Atlanta [Georgia]--sent it to Jean.  Jean looked at it, and she looked at the date.  And the date that they had on the letter--they hadn't done their homework--she and Andy were in New York.  The FBI agent who perpetuated that act later on left the FBI, and went to Andy Young and apologized.  And Andrew Young--if you haven't written about this, please forgive me for talking about it because you did share it with me.  And he told me of another story, which I'm going to write about, in which they had been in--I think, Alabama, demonstrating, organizing, and Dr. King came home.  And Coretta Scott King was playing a tape.  And when he came in the house, she, she turned the tape off.  He said, well, play it--I want to hear it.  And they had contrived the tape--the FBI had, of Dr. King at the Century Plaza Hotel in Los Angeles [California] with some women, which never happened, which never, never happened.  So, the FBI harassed Dr. King.  They made up lies on him.  They went to [President] Lyndon Baines Johnson and shared all kinds of misinformation about Dr. King, held meetings with newspaper reporters.  In those days, reporters just wouldn't print any and everything because there was a lot to print about John Fitzgerald Kennedy that they never wrote about.  They never wrote about Hoover's life, and the other side of his sexual orientation, which the newspapers never wrote about.  So, a lot of that never became public, but King was hounded and harassed by the FBI, and amends need to be made to the family just for that.  That's why everyone was so concerned about the role that the FBI played in not defending Dr. King--what, and what also set the stage for his assassination.

Speaker 1: Tell me, where were you when [Reverend] Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] was assassinated?
Speaker 2: We were going out to dinner.  Our neighbor--the neighbors had invited us to dinner.  I received a call from either Hosea Williams or [HistoryMaker] Andrew Young--might have been Hosea, because Hosea and I worked in the marches together, organizing the marches--called me and asked me if I would come to Memphis [Tennessee] because Dr. King had decided to return to Memphis for another march after the--they had some violence during one of the protest movements in which kids broke windows and more of the nonviolent element in the black community was--they were fearful it was beginning to take the march, pardon me, to take the march over.  And they asked me, as one of--as a person who was the veteran of the [James] Meredith March [Against Fear] and with a calm head--would I come down and help in the marches?  I said, "Well, I can't come down for the night"--that was the night Dr. King was assassinated-"for that march, but I'll come down the following day."  And, of course, Dr. King was assassinated.  When he was assassinated, I was shaving, getting ready to go out that evening with my wife [Lettie Clement Green] for dinner.  And we had a babysitter coming into the house, which I cancelled because immediately our house was filled with about fifty to a hundred students from Michigan State [University, East Lansing, Michigan] who walked from the campus; we lived close to the campus then--and packed our home, who were, you know, upset about Dr. King's death and wanted to know what could they do.  Of course, then, I decided to stay on the campus because there was a great deal of unrest--not just nationally, but on college campuses, and a very strong anti-white mood just swept the black students we had on campus.  So, I had a lot of work to do talking with them, the meaning of his death, and, and so forth.  And I have a picture at home that I'll show you tomorrow in which we led a protest march on campus the next day.
Speaker 1: Now, was the David Walker Center there on campus then or was that--
Speaker 2: The David--no, it wasn't there then.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that has since been closed at Michigan State.  But I, at the time, of King's assassination, I was a young professor; I was associate professor at Michigan State.  That was just before I think I became director of the Center for Urban Affairs and later on, became a dean at Michigan State.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But it's interesting that I was in that house when King was assassinated.  And so, I went down for the funeral, and there was a meeting organized by a guy by the name of William vanden Heuvel who worked for Bobby Kennedy [Senator Robert F. Kennedy].  And that night, for the funeral, I was in a meeting with Bobby Kennedy, Bill vanden Heuvel, Andrew Young, [HistoryMaker] Harry Belafonte, Hosea Williams, [HistoryMaker Reverend] James Bevel.  And we, we talked about the meaning of King's death.  And Bobby Kennedy said, well, look, I will be in Lansing [Michigan]--I'd met him through vanden Heuvel, and he knew I was from Michigan State.  "In about two weeks, I'd like to talk with you to see what we can do in terms of bringing blacks and whites together more closely."  Bobby had announced he was--Bobby Kennedy had announced he was going to run for president, and I'd like to see you.  And so, I have this famous picture of when he came to Lansing, of he and I standing face-to-face talking about King's death.  And I was playing a role with Andrew Young in setting up a follow-up meeting with Bobby Kennedy.  And he was assassinated about a week later in Los Angeles [California].  So, you had, you know, two key assassinations in a period of I guess, maybe a month and a half or so, a month, a month and a half or so.

Speaker 1: There are so many interesting figures in the Civil Rights Movement.  And some of the--a lot of the progress had to do with people playing against type or going against the grain of things that were expected with [Reverend] Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] himself.  We got figures like [HistoryMaker Reverend] James Bevel, and Hosea Williams, and other people.  I mean, what does a psychologist--I mean, can you, I mean, how did--I know there's--for instance, there's the march from, like the first march across Edmund Pettus Bridge [Selma, Alabama].
Speaker 2: Uh-hum.
Speaker 1: And they talk about how it was basically against the orders of SCLC [Southern Christian Leadership Conference].  The march just kind of took place--
Speaker 2: Uh-hum.
Speaker 1: --and then they, then the people just got with it after the--all the brutality and all that.
Speaker 2: It took off.
Speaker 1: I mean, what--[HistoryMaker] Dick Gregory talked about the psychological impact watching people beaten, and what you--I mean, as a psychologist, what do you make of some of the people and the situations that we were in, in those days?
Speaker 2: And I think people forget the important role that a lot of women played in this, like Septima [Poinsette] Clark, being one; [HistoryMaker] Marian Wright Edelman who played a legal role, who headed the Children's Defense Fund today; or Dorothy Cotton; or Fannie Lou Hamer, a very strong women, too.  For many, I often thought about it from a male standpoint.  I think their participation, as a psychologist, was a struggle to survive as a man, and to maintain that manhood.  That, that piece was central to seeing the brute force, overtly the brute force, that was used against blacks.  And in those days, it was brute force.  Just a few years ago, as I tell my students at Michigan State [University, East Lansing, Michigan], my young students today, who are yet undergraduates, they can't believe the things that happened to blacks.  It happened to their parents.  A lot of the parents don't talk about it.  But I think the syndrome of manhood, and the struggle to maintain that manhood, and to maintain their dignity, and a sense to see that they could really grab it and hang on to it, was by acting against that kind of discrimination, knowing that they could lose their lives.  King always knew he could die and, sure, he would say it in one of his speeches-"I, sure, I'd like to live a long time", but he said living is not worth living if you can't be a man.  He--those, those are not his terms--that's basically what Dr. King said.  Stokely Carmichael [Kwame Ture], Hosea Williams--racism energized them.  Racial discrimination in it--some people would drive them away and cause them to cower, they were a coward, they were afraid.  But to--as I look at a Andy Young or [HistoryMaker] Andrew Young, Hosea Williams, a Stokely Carmichael, a Herb Callender of CORE [Congress of Racial Equality], and I watch these men up close.  Race discrimination and the affront energized them, like when we were tear-gassed in--outside of Jackson, Mississippi.  And we were all crawling around on the ground trying to find our way through the tear gas.  When we got back to the school where we were assembling, prior to the discrimination, it actually energized Dr. King.  He gave one of his best talks, that wasn't recorded, about racism.  By the way, some of the best sermons and speeches and talks that Dr. King gave were not recorded.  I remember on a voter registration drive in Alabama, I was with him one weekend.  He spoke at about fifteen little churches, these little stump churches, in countrysides of Alabama and the little small towns of Alabama. They were the best sermons he ever preached.  He was actually practicing for that big speech ['I Have A Dream']--I would always say that he gave in Washington, D.C.--no, that had already occurred.  So, he wasn't practicing for that.  But Dr. King, some of the most monumental sermons he ever gave weren't recorded.  So, but coming back to your point, for it wasn't--the brutality didn't cause him to become fearful and to run and to be called, be called by it--it energized them.  And I never really thought about it.  They would come back and fight racism in a much more forceful way.  So, racism had an energizing effect.
Story_ID: 203665
Speaker 1: We interviewed [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr.] C.T. Vivian in--
Speaker 2: I know C.T. very well.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  And he was actually walking us through himself on the Dallas County Courthouse [Dallas County, Alabama] steps being hit in the mouth by--is it, uh--
Speaker 2: By the sheriff--
Speaker 1: Yeah, Clark, wasn't it Jim Clark?
Speaker 2: Jim Clark, Jim Clark.
Speaker 1: Clark, yeah.  And he talked about seeing a billy--he knew he was agitating himself towards that kind of attack, and when the billy club was coming, he says he saw it and he said, this voice came out of this guy.  It was a voice of a man he knew in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] who said, "Don't let him hit you between the eyes," (laughter), "let him hit you in the mouth, rather, because you can be killed if you get hit between--"
Speaker 2: Right between the eyes, right.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  So, he raises up on his toes to get hit, you know, in the mouth, rather than between the eyes with the thing.
Speaker 2: I can believe that.
Speaker 1: He falls down.  He gets up and he's arrested.  That's what he said--he wanted to be arrested because then they would have a case.  But he's a man that says he doesn't drive any slower than ninety, one hundred miles an hour on the highway.  I mean, he's not a meek man by any means, you know.  But he had, you know, but, you know--
Speaker 2: Well, yeah, I know.
Speaker 1: As a psychologist, what do you make of somebody who would let himself get hit like that for a cause, and then he drives, you know, you miss--it's a different kind of mentality, I think.
Speaker 2: Well, well, what happens when you--he--the greater cause was to take the blow which had a galvanizing effect back at Brown's Chapel [Brown Chapel African Methodist Episcopal Church, Selma, Alabama].  When they went back to church, Brown's Chapel, everyone knew he had been hit.  So, he took the blow in a deliberate, calculated way, and if--even if he had been able to strike back, to say I will not strike back.  But when that happens to you, that anger has to, in some way, be released.  He released it as with speed.  Others release it with alcohol and that's a story.  That's a whole new set of stories that are part of the Civil Rights Movement--the number of people who had to struggle--some fell victim to it-who had to struggle with alcoholism as a way to deal with that kind of tension.  Some retreated to the church.  I look at myself, and the forms of discrimination that I've been faced with in my seventy years, and I think the driven behavior that I have and the work that I yet do--like my wife [Lettie Clement Green] says to me, you're busier today than you were at Michigan State [University, East Lansing, Michigan] as a dean.  And I think part of it is because I'm older and people think I know a lot, so I get a lot of calls and I know a lot of people.  But I think the driven behavior is because sometimes I don't do what I need to do, but sit down and reflect.  There's a book, 'Mississippi Notebook,' [Nicholas von Hoffman] written by the famous journalist--what's his name?  He was on the Mississippi March, the [James] Meredith March [Against Fear], with us.  He sent me a copy of--I'll think of his name in the minute--he sent me a copy of his book twenty-five years ago.  Do you know what?  I read that book for the first time Sunday because there were things I didn't want to--and I tell you, it wasn't easy reading, but I read it Sunday.  I went through it in an hour and a half and read that book.  So, but when you take a blow like C.T. did, that anger has to be released in some way.  And C.T., I know C.T. well and his wife.  He was not the one to go home and beat his kids or beat his wife, or not the one--C.T. is one of the most decent, as you will recall, nicest person, but he's tight, too.  C.T. is tight, but he has, C.T. has what I call very controlled anger.  You can see it in him, and but it never is directed to hurt a person.
Story_ID: 203666
Speaker 1: I'll tell you another person who has controlled their anger well and is very outgoing and smooth about it, and overtly calm about it--is [HistoryMaker] Andrew Young.  In St. Augustine, Florida, Andy Young was severely beaten, severely, too, one of the worst beatings a person has taken in the Civil Rights Movement.  Andy Young and the other was Harry Boyte, a white male who worked with the movement.  Andy Young never told me about that beating.  He--do you know who told me about the beating?  Dorothy Cotton told me about the beating that Andy--now, Andy talked about the beating that Annell Ponder took.  Annell Ponder was another person who worked for [Reverend] Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.], and she was arrested in Mississippi.  And the jail, and they tried to get Annell Ponder--the sheriffs tried to make them say, "Yes, sir," to them, and "no, sir," to them, and she wouldn't say it.  They beat her severely. She didn't die.  They put a call in to--Dorothy Cotton, Andy Young, and the guy who used to be the staff director for SCLC [Southern Christian Leadership Conference]--I'll think of his name in a minute--the three of them got in the car and drove from Atlanta [Georgia] over to Mississippi to get Annell out of jail.  Dorothy Cotton, who is a strong disciple of King, told me that when Annell Ponder came out, they had beaten her so badly in the face that she hardly recognized her.  And Dorothy Cotton said, the sheriffs looked at her, two sheriffs, deputy sheriffs had beat her--looked at Dorothy and smiled--said, "Here she is, you can have her."  And Dorothy Cotton said, "That was the only time in my life that I think, if I had a weapon, I would have been in trouble."  So, when you have experiences like that--Dorothy didn't go up to the deputy sheriffs and slapped them, and called them bad guys, and call them SOBs and MFs, but to see that happen, can have a scarring effect.  It's like kids who see their father beat their mom, and they stand there as little kids and cry.  That has a scarring effect, but they can't act against the dad because dad is an awesome guy.  He's big, he's tall, he's bigger than life.  Well, you put that--kids who grow up in families where the fathers beat mothers, they end up with a serious abuse issue in their lives if they don't receive treatment.  They themselves can end up beating, especially the boys, being abusers, too.  Well, you put that in the context of a Civil Rights Movement, where you constantly saw violence on a day-to-day basis.
Story_ID: 203667
Speaker 1: This is when the [James] Meredith March [Against Fear] in Mississippi, we were in--. The sheriff's name was Suggs Ingram.  I have a picture of Suggs Ingram.  I'll show it to you tomorrow--S-U-G-G-S.  He--there were white males standing across from the march who would put fish hooks in slingshots and fire them at, shoot them at us.  And I saw a fish hook go and hit a girl in her forehead and split her forehead, a little girl from--I think she was from Albany, Georgia.  That had an impact on me.  First impact was-"Was she hurt?"  Second impact was anger.  Third impact was fear.  And so what I did, I moved the line to the march across in front of a store owned by the wealthiest white guy in Natchez [Mississippi] or Grenada [Mississippi]--I'm getting them mixed up.  I have it at home.  And so, they no longer threw rocks at us, but I had to deal with that.  I had to deal with that when I returned to the university [Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan].  I had white friends who would never hurt anybody.  I had white friends who were liberal.  I had to deal with that.  I couldn't go back and say, you know, "the dirty SOB white man," when they, in fact, probably had never done it, they didn't hurt anyone of color.  I had to deal with Bob Follett [Robert J.R. Follett] of the Follett [Corporation] publishing company in Chicago [Illinois].  They published two of my books.  He was one--and still is yet today one of my close friends.  I had to deal with my students on campus, many who wanted to know why.  So, I had to put my feelings about those incidents as a professor, as a psychologist, as a witness to violence and brutality, as I saw it in the South--I had to put that in a certain context and deal with in a certain way in order that it would not affect my behavior, overt behavior, and my behavior to other people.  I had to talk to myself.  They say, talking to yourself is a sign of insanity.  Well, then, I was--because I had to talk to myself.  I had to sit alone and tell myself that all people are not bad people who are white.
Speaker 2: Sounds like some tough days there.  Yeah.  There's a--I know, there's even a website for SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee] veterans, you know.
Speaker 1: Uh-hum.
Speaker 2: And it's almost like reading the messages that come across, it's almost like a Vietnam War veteran describing incidents in the--
Speaker 1: You are constantly fearful of your life.  I, for the Meredith March, it was fearful.  There were some blacks who carried guns. [Reverend] Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] wouldn't allow us to carry weapons.  If you had a weapon on you, and he knew about it, you were out.  There's a picture, another picture--maybe [HistoryMaker] Paul Brock can help me find it--of me on the front page of the Atlanta Journal [Constitution].  When they failed to seat [HistoryMaker] Julian Bond--Julian Bond and I were close friends during that days, during that time.  He won a legislature seat in the State of Georgia representing his district, and he was an outspoken opponent of the Vietnam War, so the Georgia delegation refused to seat him.  The day they refused to give him a seat, I led a group of marchers up the steps trying to walk into--to crash really--the legislative assembly.  And a state, a group of state troopers were beating us with batons back down the stairs.  And I had a picket sign in my hand, and I put my picket sign up to block the blow, and the picture taken and was on the front page of the paper, and it looked like I was fighting the trooper when, in fact, I was trying to ward off a blow.  The next morning at home, I received a phone call.  It was Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.  He said, "[HistoryMaker] Bob [Robert Green]?"  I said, "Yes, sir"--I knew who he was.  I said, "Yes, sir."  And he said, "Do you still believe in nonviolence?"  I said, "Yes, sir."  He said, "What about that picture that was on, that's on"--it was either yesterday's or today's, I can't remember whether he called me that day or the next, the next day--Atlanta Journal Constitution?  I said, "Dr. King, I was not swinging at that state trooper.  I was defending, defending myself."  He said, "Okay."  He said, "I just wanted to make sure that you yet was committed to nonviolence."
Story_ID: 203668
Speaker 1: You mentioned James Meredith before--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and he's really taking a real kind of a strange turn according to some, I guess, in terms of his thinking these days.  What--how, do you have any analysis of that?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, I wouldn't want to comment on any one individual, but I think their--the severity of the movement, the intensity, the impact--first of all, to do what these people did took a very unusual personality to step out there and take that stance.  James Meredith wasn't just accidentally picked to deseg--Autherine Lucy to desegregate the University of Alabama [Tuscaloosa, Alabama].  These were very strong, unusual people, but sometimes even strong, unusual people can't, in the long run, weather the impact of severe racial discrimination--I mean, to have people spit on you.  That's probably the one of the low--worst indignities a person can suffer is to be spat on, to be physically beaten, to be rejected, to be continually told that you're worthless, both verbally, and in your efforts to try to enter an institution of higher learning in a nation where education is valued, to know that you can't use a public library in your town, even though you are a taxpayer, even though, once again, you're raised in a community in which, you know, the weight--another way to look at it, and this is a neat way to put it as a psychologist:  racism and racial discrimination is insane.  It has strong insanity components built into it, but yet we expect people to respond in a sane way.  Racism is illogical, but we expect the victim to be logical in their reasoning and their approach to life.  It's unreasonable, but yet we expect people--the victims of it--to be reasonable.  So, you have unreasonable behavior directed at people, insane behavior directed at people, illogical behaviors directed at people, and you expect them to be logical, reasonable, and sane.  It just doesn't fit. It doesn't always fit.  Some people make it fit.  Andy Young [HistoryMaker Andrew Young] has survived and has made it fit.  [HistoryMaker] Julian Bond, who has a major role with NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], has made it fit.  Julian has seen a lot in his young life, experienced a lot in his life in terms of racial discrimination.  But Fannie Lou Hamer, see the--I think, the veterans of old had something that--and I wouldn't call Julian an old veteran of old, because Julian Bond is not seventy-five, eighty years of age.  I would guess Julian is probably what--about sixty-two, sixty-three, at most.  He's a younger person.  The veterans of old had a faith and a belief in God, and an involvement and religion that sheltered them, and protected them, and protected their ego or, better yet, protected their superego and their ego.  But the younger generation does not have that same kind of belief system and involvement and faith in a higher power or higher order or a God, so to speak.
Speaker 1: You're talking about the younger generation of the Civil Rights Movement, the SNCC activists [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee], and so?
Speaker 2: Yeah, those who came, uh-hum, sure.  They didn't quite have it as the older adults had it.  They had religion to shelter and protect them from the wrath of behavior and its impact because racial discrimination was vengeful.  It was directed at people in a vengeful way, hateful way.  And the wrath of the white community was constantly upon blacks, for those who practiced discrimination.  And that's all we saw.  We didn't see--many blacks didn't see the good whites, the whites of goodwill, those who were passive, who did nothing, who, even those who disapproved of it, and some actively disapproved of it, but you didn't see those people.  You typically came in contact with those who were in the daily practice of being vengeful and discriminatory, and, you know, it had its impact on many generations and those who survived, survived through church, religion, and through education.  My dad's [Thomas J. Green] wrong.  My dad said that, my dad used to argue with us, "The only way to overcome the wrath of the white community is to get an education and stay close to God. You got two forms of protection.  That's all you've got."  That was my dad's instruction.

Speaker 1: (HISTORYMAKER PAUL BROCK):  Did he mean the younger kids who were with SCLC [Southern Christian Leadership Conference] and SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee].  And I'm not sure--he said yes--I'm not sure he meant yes.  Or did you mean the kids of today?
Speaker 2: No, I'm referring to the young people of today.
Speaker 1: (HISTORYMAKER PAUL BROCK):  Right.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah, young people of today.  But the older generation, even those older than, say, a [HistoryMaker] Julian Bond, those who, for example, if [Reverend] Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] was alive today, he'd be seventy-eight, I guess.  Is that right?  He died at thirty-nine in '68 [1968], so he'd be in his late seventies.
Speaker 2: He was born in '29 [1929], yeah.
Speaker 1: And Dr. King was young when he was killed, assassinated.  He was assassinated when he was thirty-nine years of age--he was young.  Oh, the Fannie Lou Hamer--that generation older than King by maybe ten, fifteen years.  They were deeply, deeply involved in their religious faith and their religious practice.  And that, that's reflected in the songs they sing during the movement that were basically religiously based.  They believed that a higher power named God in the final analysis would deliver them from the wrath and evils, practices visited upon them by the white community.  The younger generation felt less of that.
Speaker 2: Yeah, but, well, not all of them have done that badly though.  I mean, there's some that--well, there's some of the younger generation, like who have really suffering some psychological damage, but there are some that seemed to have gone on and done well.
Speaker 1: Yeah, sure, that's right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, [Robert Parris Moses] Bob Moses just won a MacArthur [Fellowship, "Genius Grant"] award the other day--
Speaker 1: That's right--
Speaker 2: --and seems to be doing pretty good, though--
Speaker 1: --the Algebra Project.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he feels all this deeply, I'm sure.
Speaker 1: Sure.
Speaker 2: And, you know, so did Julian Bond and probably some of the younger people that were--
Speaker 1: And it could be, too, that some people were more sheltered growing up.  You pick out two people.  Look at the kind of family from--that Julian Bond was from--Horace Mann Bond, Ph.D., a great deal of upper middle class.  I mean, who, how many blacks had Ph.D.s in their families at that time?  Or [HistoryMaker Andrew Young] Andy Young's father [Andrew Jackson Young, Sr.] was a dentist in New Orleans [Louisiana], very successful dentist.  Andy, Andy was not beaten on the streets as a kid.  Andy had a good sense--but more important, I think people who survived are those who have a good sense of who they are, and what they are, and what they can become, and what they can overcome--who they are, what they are, what they can become, or what they can overcome.  And, for example, in our family, we were always taught that if you get an education and stay close to the church, you can overcome.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Now, I did one for sure--I got the education.  I was somewhat close to the church--not totally, but I always felt that there has very little that I could not conquer if I worked hard enough, and worked smart enough, and had the support of others.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So, I never assumed that anything I've done, I did it on my own.  That is completely untrue.

Speaker 1: Now, from '68 [1968] on--correct me if I'm wrong, I guess, most of your activities are at Michigan State [University, East Lansing, Michigan], right, and as of--
Speaker 2: Michigan State in '68 [1968] till '83 [1983].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I went to Washington, D.C. to serve as president of the University of the District of Columbia [Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 1: Now, you became a dean at Michigan State in '73 [1973]--
Speaker 2: Seventy-three [1973]--
Speaker 1: --in '73 [1973], right.
Speaker 2: --to '82 [1982].
Speaker 1: Yeah, to '82 [1982].  The--
Speaker 2: Seventy-two [1972], I guess in '72 [1972] I was named dean--
Speaker 1: Yeah, of the Center for Urban Affairs, right, director, yeah.
Speaker 2: I was director there of the Center for Urban Affairs and dean of the College of Urban Development [Urban Affairs Program], at Michigan State.
Speaker 1: Now, what were you goals at the Center for Urban Affairs?
Speaker 2: In the--in that program?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: To--at the Center for Urban Affairs, to collect information and data to assist in overcoming various forms of societal discrimination.  For example, over that period of time, I became the chief expert witness for the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] national office of more than twenty-two major desegregation cases.  Well, a lot of the background and research was done under my leadership through the Center for Urban Affairs.  Later on, as dean of the College of Urban Development, our goal was to train students to work primarily in urban areas, to help people overcome their condition as a discriminated-against minority in an urban community.  And that's what we did at Michigan State.
Story_ID: 203671
Speaker 1: Left there [Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan] went to Washington, D.C.  From there, on to Cleveland [Ohio] where I was at Cuyahoga Community College [Cleveland, Ohio] for a while.
Speaker 2: Okay.  I just--I don't want to run over anything, but why did you--how did you end up at University of the District of Columbia [UDC, Washington, D.C.] as president?  Now, there's a story there, I guess, about that.
Speaker 1: I never really wanted to be a college president.  There was a man by the name of Ron, who later on became secretary of commerce, who was killed in a plane accident in Europe.  I had met Ron Brown during his work with the Urban League, and my wife [Lettie Clement Green] was very active with the [National] Urban League and I, from time to time, worked with the Urban League.  He came to Michigan State and interviewed me, and interviewed--he said he had heard about my background, got my resume, which had a number of listings, books, articles, and he approached me about coming to Washington, D.C., and I turned him down.  He went back to Washington.  They hired the president of the Chicago State University [Chicago, Illinois] and brought him to UDC.  He ran into some political problems.  It was a tough institution politically.  It was a blend of four institutions in Washington into one.  Politics were severe.  He lasted nine months and he left.  Ron Brown called me.  He contacted me again.  I went to Washington.  I said, "Why not give it a try?"  And although I have always not wanted to be tied down to answering to a board, especially a political board, and I said yes.  And I was there for two years, and did what I could to improve the institution at every level.  And Ron was chairman of my board, and a good man.  And I left, and went to Cleveland State University [Cleveland, Ohio] for a while, Case Western Reserve [University, Cleveland, Ohio].  One of my former students was president of Cuyahoga Community College.  I helped him for a while.  And then Michigan State made me an offer to come back-
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --and I returned to the university.
Story_ID: 203672
Speaker 1: You returned to Michigan State [University, East Lansing, Michigan] in--
Speaker 2: Let's see, eight years ago maybe?
Speaker 1: Yeah, '96 [1996], I guess it was.
Speaker 2: Ninety-six [1996], about that time.
Speaker 1: That's, yeah, that's what I have here.  Okay, now, and you've been engaged in the last, past few years, in researching Detroit Public Schools right here, and trying to--I guess, untangle what had become a kind of a bad situation in Detroit Public Schools, right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  The school was since--it was taken over by the state.  The state, in turn, turned it over to the mayor--the Mayor Dennis Archer, at the time.  And they embarked on what they call a school reformed plan under Act 10, a legislative act, to improve the Detroit [Michigan] schools.  And they were mandated to come up with a school improvement plan and to implement it.  I was given a grant by the Skillman Foundation and New Detroit [Inc.].  The grant was given to the Skillman Foundation.  I was commissioned by New Detroit to head that study up, and for the last three years, I've been involved in evaluating the impact of school reform in the City of Detroit.  But also, I've been helping the Dallas Independent School District in Dallas, Texas evaluate the impact of their court order in the aftermath of being released from that court order.  So, much of my work in writing over the last several years of related school reform.  And I have a book out now, a publication out now, 'Teacher Expectations and Student Achievement' ['ExpectA+ions (How Teacher Expectations Can Increase Student Achievement and Assist in Closing the Achievement Gap)'].  You'll get a copy of it tomorrow.  And that was recently published in June by McGraw Hill [Education], and it's being used in school districts around the country.  It's a guide to providing support for teachers, instructions for teachers, to hold high expectations for students' success.  So, much of my writing and research has been related to school reform in the last several years.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But now, I'm looking at ways to do a biography on myself and my wife's [Lettie Clement Green] family, my family and my wife's family.  But also, there's a lot I've seen and know about the Civil Rights Movement, that hasn't been really written and the stories have not been told, and I plan to get to that eventually.  That's why I'm not going to retire.  So, I think the best person alive, and has been for a long time--the authentic book on the civil rights movement without question is Andrew Jackson Young [HistoryMaker Andrew Young].  If one could ever motivate him to do it, he could do it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What's the best book that's out here now?  What are your, what are some of the better books you think about the Civil Rights Movement that exist now?
Speaker 2: Well, I won't single out any, anyone.  There have been a number of writers.  I think the Stanford University [Stanford, California] series ['The Papers of Martin Luther King, Jr.,' Clayborne Carson] on [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther] King [Jr.], commissioned by Coretta Scott King, is the best written and most authentic piece on Dr. King and his role in the Civil Rights Movement, which captures much of the Civil Rights Movement at the same time--the young professor at Stanford--I'm blocking on his name [HistoryMaker Clayborne Carson], I will recall it in a minute--authored that series, and it wasn't written for glamour or for sale, but it was, it was a very authentic piece, and I have a copy of it at home, and the author's name, for the moment, escapes me.  And when we get together tomorrow, I'll give you--share that with you.  I think that's the most authentic, Taylor Branch ['The King Years: Historic Moments in the Civil Rights Movement'], and others have written, but that piece is the most authentic piece, I think.
Story_ID: 203673
Speaker 1: Is there anything that you think that people--is there any one thing or couple of things that you think that most people need to know about the Civil Rights Movement that they don't know now?
Speaker 2: I think that one should--I believe and should remember--that it was the most important and authentic rebellion against societal conditions that had an impact on the order of this nation to ever occur.  I can't think of any, other than maybe the Civil War, that great conflict, which led to the freeing of slaves, but past the Civil War, it had to be the Civil Rights Movement, the one movement really initiated by the actions of Rosa Parks.  That had an impact on--that led to Title I, [Title] II, [Title] III, [Title] IV, and really led to much of what we see as a change in the social order today in contrast to what it was pre-, pre-Brown [v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954], pre-'54 [1954].  But when Rosa Parks refused to go to the back of the bus, that started the revolution that [Reverend] Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.], due to his wisdom and strength, courage, leadership, and his ability to speak, and galvanize the poor people together, was able to take advantage of, and provide leadership for.  So, I would say that movement and, and the fact that it changed the social order of America, it changed the thinking and attitudes of people.  You know, first you change the behavior, and after you change behavior, often attitude--sometimes attitudes will change. Not always, but often, you know, attitudes will change.  So, I would say, that what people ought to remember--if it had not been for that movement, waiting for people to make up their minds that segregation and discrimination should end, we might not be far along today in contrast to what we were in 1952, '53 [1953] when I finished high school [Northern High School, Detroit, Michigan].  So that's important.  I think, secondly, it provided people with a courage to challenge systems.  Dr. King and the movement, along with the support of the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], CORE [Congress of Racial Equality], and other, the Urban League: they challenged systems.  Little people challenged big systems, and they succeeded, and that's a prototype today for the suit against Walmart [Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 2011].  Women who sued Walmart, little women--I mean, people, when I say little, in terms of what we perceive as prominence--attack that system, you know, in terms of discrimination--the Denny's case [U.S. v. Flagstar Corporation and Ridgeway v. Flagstar Corporation, 1994], the Cracker Barrel case [United States of America v. Cracker Barrel Old Country Store, Inc., 2004], all of those in some way have their genesis or their roots in what the movement provided in terms of leadership.
Story_ID: 203674
Speaker 1: After '68 [1968], there's a more, sort of black students on campus at Michigan State [University, East Lansing, Michigan], and black people in urban centers of the North, especially, had a more militant attitude around racial discrimination and such.  And is that what inspired the fact that the David Walker Center [Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan] came into being, named after the firebrand of the nineteenth century, David Walker called for black folks to take up arms.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: He was also a victim of assassination, you know, shortly after he did that.  But is there, did you have--how did you approach, you know, this changing militancy on campus and so forth?
Speaker 2: My view was that whatever it takes to continue to change in a permanent way the social order that was embedded in various forms of racial discrimination, whatever it takes--short of violence.  I've never condoned or endorsed the notion of violence at any level.  Whatever it takes, let it be, as long as it's defined, it's targeted at an institution, and it's going to have some impact on the lives of people who are victims of that system or that institution.  So, militant students didn't bother me.  The students would come by my house at night and sit and debate, and talk with me at length about nonviolence and [Reverend] Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.], the importance of King versus Stokely Carmichael [Kwame Ture].  And I said, really, they were pursuing the same goals.  Later on, Mandela, to me, Nelson Mandela, internationally reflected the importance of nonviolence.  Prior to going to Robben Island [Prison, Robben Island, South Africa], the twenty-seven years he spent there [sic.], which is a significant part of his life, his aftermath in terms of the leadership of this country--he had a militant voice, but it's--what's militant?  Militant in that he speaks against the corporate interests of America?  That he speaks against the war in Iraq [Iraq War] today and the use of power by countries like Great Britain and France and Russia, in the past, to dominate and manipulate and control other entities?  That's the most militant--when we say people are angry and militant, what we typically mean in American life is that they challenge the American order which has provided leadership, I think, for the world in terms of colonial powers--the way we got the Panama Canal [Panama]. You know, so what is militarism?  I think when people talk the militarism--militancy is a better word.  When they talk about the militant students of the '60s [1960s] and '70s [1970s], they said they were talking about young people who spoke out against the social order in America which manifested itself, not only in the United States, but throughout the world.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: As--and it's being reflected today in Iraq, in our policy in Iraq.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Which Dr. King would have spoken against and been vilified for speaking against, as he was vilified for speaking out against the war in Vietnam [Vietnam War].  Even at the presidential race, [John] Kerry and [John] Edwards and [President George Walker] Bush all not--Bush is saying, "I didn't make a mistake.  I would--I did something about Saddam [Hussein]."  Kerry, it was the same: "We would have done something about Saddam, too, but in a different way."  Well, you know, what does it say?  What are they saying to people? That America has a right to judge people around the world, you know, and it's when we here in--America has many issues that are not yet resolved, that are culturally embedded in violence in this country.
Story_ID: 203675
Speaker 1: Do you think that [Reverend] Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] would enjoy the same status if he were still alive as he has, you know, since he's been a--
Speaker 2: In death?
Speaker 1: --or even be--do you think he's really remembered in the right way now?
Speaker 2: I think, in terms of King's courage, his leadership, his belief in the freedom and liberation of all people, he's remembered in the proper light.  When they see King as some--my high school kids have all he did was lead marches and sing 'We Shall Overcome.'  I said, no, King met with senators. He played very strong political role in American life.  King met on Capitol Hill [Washington, D.C.].  He met with senators.  He met with moneyed whites to try to get them to use their money and influence to end the race discrimination order in America.  The part--that's the part of King that's not clearly reflected on.  If he was--if he had lived, I think he would have grown in prominence.  I think the effort on the part of J. Edgar Hoover and the right wing order of America--and I don't say that in a kind of wild, irrational way because there was a right wing order and a southern order, some living in the North, too, who would have liked to have put King away.  If James Earl Ray had not assassinated King, I doubt that he would have lived much longer anyway because he was too much of a threat to the American order.  And when he had that famous meeting January--I think it was near his birthday in Atlanta [Georgia], January of 19-, he was assassinated in '68 [1968]--might have been that January in which he organized the first big Poor People's Organizing [Campaign] Committee [of 100] meeting in Atlanta [Georgia], which I attended.  And you had Native Americans there, you had whites, liberal whites, poor whites, upper middle income whites--it was at Ebenezer Baptist Church [Atlanta, Georgia]--blacks, Hispanics--Cesar Chavez's people were there.  When Hoover knew, as Hoover monitored that meeting, because he monitored all King's meetings, and the nation saw what King was about--pulling together a poor people's march in the context of the war against poverty, that was a very threatening thing.  I think King would have pulled that off, bridging the gap--because racial lines and class lines--to deal with a common enemy called poverty.  That would have been a monumental contribution.  King was never allowed to, to pull that off.  He was assassinated, I think, that April [1968].  So, those who led the march, namely, Ralph [D.] Abernathy, did not have the strength in others, the know-how, the wherewithal, the wisdom, and the ability to organize as King had the amazing ability to do to make that march a success.
Story_ID: 203676
Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: I am concerned about our youth, especially black, young black males, and our families, the tight knitness that's needed in our families' life and family structure.  Not all black families, not all black youth--we have what we call in statistics, a bimodal distribution.  We have a group of black males over here who do poorly, who drop out of school, who end up on a corner dealing in illegal kinds of traffic.  And we know that in the population that when you drop out of school, and you are standing on a street corner, unemployed, you are a candidate for San Quentin [State Prison] in [San Quentin] California, Jackson [State] Prison in [Jackson] Michigan, Lorton [Reformatory] in [Washington] D.C., and I don't know the one in Chicago [Illinois]--
Speaker 1: Stateville [Correctional Center, Crest Hill, Illinois] or--
Speaker 2: Stateville in Chicago [sic.], you're a candidate, so that's one distribution.  Then over here, you have another distribution of young men who are African American.  They're smaller in number who are doing superbly well.  They're at the Michigan States [Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan], the University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan], Chicago States [Chicago State University, Chicago, Illinois], University of Illinois, Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts], Yale [University, New Haven, Connecticut], who are doing well, who are going on, who will achieve an American life.  But that population of young black men are much smaller than the larger population there.  Secondly, I think, you know, we can learn from other communities, as an African American community.  And I think the community that has struggled to maintain its commitment to its culture and to education is the Asian community, particularly the Japanese, Chinese community, and now, the Vietnamese community as we see it growing in the United States, especially in places like Texas.  The key there is family life, and they let nothing threaten family life and their pursuit of an education, and to bring family--pull families up, and I think that is the challenge.  We have--and again, we have the bimodal distribution.  We have African American families that are indeed strong and overcome many, many obstacles and provide many opportunities for the young people to succeed.  But we also have on that other distribution, African American families that are continually caught in the cycle of poverty and despair.  And those of us who had the fortune, good fortune to make a living, to raise our kids, to keep our sons out of jail, to keep them on track, keep our daughters out of the cycle of having babies--we owe it to that community to work with it--not to give to it, but to support it and to find ways to overcome those conditions that are destabilizing in a continuing way to those--to that community.  And I see myself as a part of that community.  I've never extracted myself from the poor poverty-based community.  Sure, I make enough money to eat every day.  My sons are employed.  We don't have to worry about the next meal, but in a way, I worry about people who have to worry about the next meal.  It's like I don't have a next meal.  So, the obligation--I think, I was, I was just telling my good friend, [HistoryMaker] Paul Brock, in some way we need to call together another national meeting called by blacks--not a march on Washington [D.C.], black men marching on Washington, but to bring together a combination of ministers, social scientists, welfare workers, and indigenous community people who're poor--to work together to see what we can do to uplift our communities, because that cycle of poverty, a cycle of violence, a cycle of prison life, is devastating in certain segments of our community.  And when, if we take the State of California--I don't know why people always think of California as the most liberal state in the union, and which it is not.  San Francisco [California], like--a city where I lived for eight years, I know it like the back of my hand; where my wife [Lettie Clement Green] was raised, in Chinatown, San Francisco.  The Berkeley, California school system, Sacramento [California] system, the San Francisco United [School District] school system, the Los Angeles Unified School District--for black men, they are breeding grounds for prison life.  California has more black men in state, local, state, city jails, state, local and federal prisons proportionately than any other state in the union.  Check the Sentencing Project in Washington, D.C.  Check their data.  California, sunny California, proportionately out-strips the State of Illinois and the State of Michigan, two states we know well.
Story_ID: 203677
Speaker 1: We had not mentioned the Association of Black Psychologists [ABPsi].  We need to talk about that.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: You were one of the founders of the Association of Black Psychologists?
Speaker 2: I was one of the co-founders, along with Charles Thomas, who's now deceased, and [Robert Williams] Bob Williams.  In the first year of the Association of Black Psychologists, we were formed in San Francisco [California]--I believe in 1968 at the summer--September meeting after the assassination of [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther] King [Jr.].  And Charles Thomas and I co-chaired it for the first year, and Bob Williams was a manager of the second year.  We wanted to bring together the black psychologists who were working as professionals around the country to begin to address the issues of race discrimination and its impact on individuals, families, and communities.  That was our goal.  And we felt that we had a unique view, which we did have, of the problem in black communities, and also the issue of white racism as was being generated in the white community and, in turn, impacting on the black community.  And so, we formed as a group during that period of time to address education issues, employment issues, health issues, police brutality issues at that time.  And some of us would practice our trade more so in terms of our field.  For example, I became the lead expert for the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] and school desegregation cases.  There were some who became experts on discrimination in the field of health.  Bob Williams' language discrimination ends in the context of schools, Washington University in St. Louis, [St. Louis] Missouri.  So, we played different roles but, collectively, we wanted to use our training and experience to address the issue of mass discrimination and its impact on the African American community.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now black psychologists know they--as I remember as a student, you know, reading the works of [HistoryMaker Dr.] Price Cobbs and William Greer--
Speaker 2: Uh-hum, uh-hum.
Speaker 1: --and, you know, reading the articles of Dr. Bobby E. Wright in Chicago [Illinois] and others.  I mean, black psychologists were really, were stepping up to the--
Speaker 2: To the plate, uh-hum, they sure were, absolutely.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And I think, collectively, they played a good role nationally, and they're yet meeting.  There's a major meeting at Michigan State [University, East Lansing, Michigan] tomorrow.  [Joseph White] Joe White, who encouraged me to come on, to get my Ph.D. at Michigan State, was the first black to get a Ph.D. in psychology at Michigan State.  That was in 19-, let's see, I finished in '62 [1962].  That was in '61 [1961], and a very prominent person.  And they are addressing a series of issues yet tomorrow in East Lansing [Michigan].  Psychologists are coming together to discuss the lingering issues, the serious issues that affect the mental health of the African American community.
Story_ID: 203678
Speaker 1: Prior to the late '60s [1960s], we had the National Medical Association [NMA] and the black lawyers that organized themselves on some level, but after '68 [1968], you see a lot of the black professionals organize themselves in groups that--
Speaker 2: [National Association of] Black Social Workers [NABSW]--
Speaker 1: --National Black Police Association [NBPA] started.
Speaker 2: Social Workers.
Speaker 1: Black Social Workers.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: You even had the African--the black historians and the African Studies Association [ASA] organize themselves into the African Heritage Studies Association [AHSA] is--so all the, all this--
Speaker 2: Black Firefighters Association [International Association of Black Professional Firefighters]--
Speaker 1: Exactly, exactly.
Speaker 2: --just met in Las Vegas [Nevada] about a year ago.
Speaker 1: And we'd almost go all along--nurses, teachers, you know, all these organizations are formed, professional organizations.
Speaker 2: All had basically get the same goal: "How do we unite to end the evil forces of discrimination that affect our profession and the larger black community?"  They all had a common goal.  That would be the best way to put it.  "How do we unite to end the serious and insidious discrimination that face us in our profession, one, and the society of the black community as a whole?"
Speaker 1: Yes, some might argue-and, I mean, it's not gonna be me, but--well, "Why couldn't you all do that in the regular, the American Psychological Association [APA], and that sort of thing instead of why do you have to form a black one?"
Speaker 2: Because take the American Psychological Association.  They would entrap you into the belief that things aren't not as serious as African American psychologists, at that time, and even today, see discrimination.  Secondly, approach is to ending that discrimination would differ.  You would find conservative writers in the white community describing, getting one to try to understand why people practice race discrimination, and would have even a different view of its impact on the African American community.  Whereby African American psychologists had one basic philosophy: discrimination is bad, and let's end it. No excuses.  Whatever it takes, let's end it.  And that was a unified approach among black psychologists, and their writings reflected it.  My writings reflect that.  There is no justification for the abuse of a person, the mistreatment of a person, the damning of a person's psychic.  There's no excuse for it, and therapy is not the approach to undo it. (Laughter) So, I tell blacks who go to psychology--I mean, go to therapy, maybe we all need to sit around and talk about the things that affect us, but I believe in group therapy.  Let's do it as a group, because there are so many commonalities.  I'll give you an example.  I belong to a black male professional group, a highly educated group called Sigma Pi Phi, and they have what they call Boules around the country.  In the Lansing, Michigan Boule, subordinate Boule, there are probably maybe thirty-five men.  One night, we--I got, I was at the meeting early, and there were about twelve of us standing around waiting for the rest of the members to assemble.  These are highly educated black men--M.D.s, lawyers, Ph.D.s in the group, twelve of us, and I tried this.  I said, "Look, how do we go around this group"--we're standing in a circle--I said, "I bet each one of you has faced at least one issue of discrimination in your life that you'll never forget."  That was a mind blower.  That session lasted about thirty minutes before the meeting started, and the stories they told could make for the writing of a book.  So, even blacks who you say, well, they're highly standing, they have a master's degree or a Ph.D., they're a lawyer.  They really don't know--they do know.  All--any black has gone through the system of education in America, the neighborhood system, the riding the bus system, the shopping system, the getting on the elevator system if there's a white male on there (laughter), white female on the elevator grabbing a purse, people tightening up when they see you in stores shopping in certain sections of the stores.  Anyone who's gone through that, and most all blacks have gone through it, they have a common thread, and a common set of experiences that they'll never forget.
Story_ID: 203679
Speaker 1: So, why not work within traditional organizations?  I would say that the--even whites of goodwill, who are good people, decent people--that there is a line in terms of their ability to understand the nuances of racial discrimination--just the way people look at you, the difference between a person that looks at you in a crowd with a smile, and some who look at you with a sneer.  I ride airplanes a lot, and because I've flown so much, I typically fly in the front.  When you sit down, the body language of people--some people are very friendly, outgoing, how are you, what are you, and so forth, and others react as if they want to move.  So, so you go through all that, you go through that process.  And, again, it comes back to my other point--yes, it exists.  It's different within communities, and the nuances are something that only those, like Native Americans, Hispanics, you know, I can't describe how it feels to grow up being a Mexican in Laredo, Texas, or in Dallas [Texas].  But I can describe how it feels growing up as an African American in those same communities, and the same with our professional organizations.  White psychologists--that's why I talk about therapy.  They can understand.  They may be able to understand pain, but they have difficulty understanding the unique pain that people of particular groups suffer.  Women in our society--I, you know, I had a lot of female graduate students, and I was in the counter group session with a group of my female students years ago, and just the way men look at them can be harassing.  I never thought of that--a look?  Oh, sure, a man could look at you a certain way walking down the street.  So, I'm very careful about how I look at women, how I make sure I always keep eye contact with them.  That's because of a training session I went through with my students some twenty, twenty-five years ago.  I don't look down or mid-way.  I keep eye contact--always with women because I learned from the experience of others who shared it with me, that that can be a form of harassment, especially in, in the work situation.  So, there are unique things that happen to people because of gender, by race, by age, and by social class.  And those unique experiences cannot always--the depth of those feelings--cannot always be understood and experienced by others, and I don't expect that.  I don't expect a white male to understand how I feel about reparations, you know.  I taught a class at Michigan State [University, East Lansing, Michigan] about two years ago, and a white male in the class--and the class was predominantly white--as all the classes at Michigan State, asked me-"I have never discriminated against a person in my life.  Why should I have to pay for it?  Maybe my father did." (Laughter) And that's not always an easy question to answer, and my response is, "The benefits that your father received of being white laid the foundation for you to be at Michigan State, so it's not that you, individually, did anything, but your dads, collectively, and their behavior could build the foundation for reparations."  And I know that's, that's a hot topic, you know, reparations.  Indians have received it.  Germany is now paying reparations to Jews who worked in factories and corporations, IBM, BMW, Mercedes [Benz], for free, free labor--you don't talk about reparations there.  Even the Jewish--the wealthy Jewish community itself, is paying out reparations for poor Jews and payin--paying out money to support Jews, not reparations.  And so, you know, those unique experiences and unique views aren't shared by--I don't know any white psychologists that would agree with me on reparations.  I think that Michigan State University ought to pay reparations to myself and other faculty members who were on the faculty early, due to the discrimination that we face in the Town of East Lansing that the university did nothing about, and refused to do anything about, and the discrimination that we saw black students faced with at Michigan State--being put in separate dorm rooms, being asked to move when whites--and I saw that, or when it was Mississippi State [University, Starkville, Mississippi] or the University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan]--the University of Mississippi State.  It was Mississippi State, years ago, brought a football team to Michigan State, to play Michigan State.  And the coach at Mississippi State went to President [John] Hannah and said, "Look, if any black ball players play, the game won't be played."  He pulled all the black ball players--this is before I came to Michigan State, but I know about it.  I came to Michigan State in '60 [1960].  This is about '50 [1950], '51 [1951].  Now Mississippi State has a black coach.  Times have changed.  So, your unique experiences and your unique views in life can shape your thinking about the solution.  And the solution that you may arrive at may not the same that others who are not a part of that group would live with, and even some within the group.

Speaker 1: When you look back on all the things that you've done, is there any major thing that you would do differently now?
Speaker 2: I'm not so sure.  I probably--the Washington, D.C. experience [at University of the District of Columbia, Washington, D.C.] was a good one, but I second guessed myself.  I was not a good college president--I'll tell you why.  I'm an easy "Yes," and a college president has to be a tough "No."  I had, I was at Michigan State University [East Lansing, Michigan] as dean, in which I did whatever it took to make sure black kids got through that institution with a bachelor's degree, a master's [degree], or a Ph.D., or later on, an M.D., now a law degree, or a Ph.D., whatever it took, and I found different ways to get them money, finance them, and I was good at that.  I very seldom would say no to a student.  I found it very hard to, as dean, to put students out of school.  They'd always say, "See Dean [HistoryMaker Robert] Green," you'd get another chance.  I always gave people another chance, and I think a lot of that was related to my upbringing and my dad's [Thomas J. Green] upbringing with us in the church.  A college university president has to be tough, make tough decisions, and know when to cut.  And I had difficulty knowing, even when I knew someone should be cut.  I had a hard time putting somebody on the unemployment line, or sending them out without a job.  So, that was probably not the best, but probably the most place where I was most productive was when I had a major budget, had grant money, and was producing students--bachelor's, master's [degree], Ph.D. students.  And I did that in a phenomenal way at Michigan State and came back and started the process all over again.  Of course, times were different, and money was different.  But and I can't think of hardly--I think the decision to go with [Reverend] Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] was one of the best decisions I made.  The decision to marry my wife [Lettie Clement Green] at the time I did was an excellent decision.  We stayed together forty-eight years, not because of how great I am, but how strong and insightful she has been over the years.  Growing up, I think, at seventy, and not being an angry old man feels good.  I'm not a satisfied old man, there are a lot of conditions I'm going to work, in my remaining years, to see change.  There's more writing I want to do.  But I think in the scheme of things, I've had a good and productive life--not always enjoyable, but a good and productive life.

Speaker 1: What things would you consider as your legacy at this point?
Speaker 2: The students I'm leaving behind.  I have students who are college presidents, who are deans.  See, the vice-president at Starbucks, Wanda Herndon, one of my students.  I always say I helped raise Wanda.  She's senior vice president of Starbucks.  Sandra Bulger came to Michigan State [University, East Lansing, Michigan] as a sixteen-year-old skinny black kid.  She is now director of taxes, nationally and internationally, for General Motors, got a degree in accounting from Michigan State, went to the University of Michigan Law School [Ann Arbor, Michigan], C.P.A. [license], and a master's [degree] in taxation.  She's one of my students.  Rod Gillian [sic. Rod Gillun], vice president of General Motors today, is one of my students.  I could go on and on.  I think my legacy is the fact that I did use the resources that I had in an honest way to make sure that African American students first had a chance to make it.  And I have them seen them grow and develop.  Charles [H.] Beady [Jr.], president in the Piney Woods [Country Life] School [Piney Woods, Mississippi], eighteen-year-old freshman student at Michigan State--saw him get three degrees, worked for me at Michigan State.  I kept him there when he was threatening to drop out of school, and to see what he's done with the Piney Woods School in Mississippi.
Speaker 1: Now, that's a phenomenal story and a spin on a school that started near the turn of the century, I guess.
Speaker 2: Yes, it did.
Speaker 1: And it meant a lot to--
Speaker 2: African Americans--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --communities, families all over the country.
Speaker 1: Yeah, especially in the Piney Woods in those days when there was no education.
Speaker 2: None, none.
Speaker 1: Yeah, so it was a boarding school and--
Speaker 2: Mr. [Laurence C.] Jones did a phenomenal job--out of Iowa--gave that school--started, and, you know, so I could go on.  I think--so my legacy would be using the talent that I had, the position that I had.  I think my position and, you know, you're critical of an institution.  I said, Michigan State ought to pay reparations.  The one thing that I can say about Michigan State University, which makes it really a great institution--they provided myself and others an opportunity to create opportunities for other African American young men and women.  They did that--Magic Johnson being one--Magic created his own opportunity with his ability.  No one created it for him, but he's a Michigan State grad.  But I look at [Dr.] Walter [C.] Farrell [Jr.], distinguished professor at University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill [Chapel Hill, North Carolina], one of my students, and the remarkable work that he's doing today.  And my legacy, again, would be the fact that I honestly and judiciously used every strength.  And you can find students of mine around the country--I used every piece of strength in my body to make sure that my kids got through school, were well-trained, and left them with the mindset that when they left, they had an obligation to bring others along with them, so, you know, the top, the visible people like the Wanda Herndons and the Rod Gillians and the Sandra Bulger, B-U-L-G-E-R, Sandra.  She's today--I mean, she does--she's the number one tax person for General Motors.  And she can't be more than forty-eight years of age, maybe fifty, maybe fifty.  Her husband is in the number one law firm--Harold Bulger in Detroit [Michigan].  So, I will see all those students on the 14th and 15th of October of this year in which I will receive the university's distinguished alumni award and my students will come in from around the country.  So, my legacy would be that, and the fact that I gave my sons and pushed my sons to be the best that they could be as young African American men in our society.  And I think that's going to be my legacy.

Speaker 1: There's one more milestone that our friend, [HistoryMaker] Paul Brock, was telling me about.  And that's you are the chairman of the board for Piney Woods [Country Life School, Piney Woods, Mississippi].  You're the first black chairman of the board for--or African American chairman (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes. And I will chair my first meeting in October.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: By the name, chairman of the board, and I see that as a highlight of my life and career because I love Piney Woods.  I love the work that it does.  And I'm now at an age and I know people that I can bring to bear on Piney Woods to help it from a financial standpoint.  And I keep, I've mentioned Andy Young's [HistoryMaker Andrew Young] name twenty times today.  Andy Young is the most connected black in America--can't think of one better connected with the white money and the black money community, and he's committed himself to help raise money for the Piney Woods School, and I'm working--he's--he and I are working together.  Now, we're very close.  I have another very close friend, Willie Herenton [W. W. Herenton], mayor of the City of Memphis [Tennessee], who is another supporter of the school.  So, the people that I've known over the years--I'm going to bring them together collectively, and we'll ask Paul Brock to help from a communications standpoint, to help us make sure that school gets back on a solid financial footing; remains on a solid financial footing.  But I do love the Piney Woods School.

Speaker 1: Did your mother [Alberta Vinson Green] and father [Thomas J. Green] get a chance to see you become successful, and what do they think about your career?
Speaker 2: Yes, they lived to see me become--let's see, my mother died--father died in '68 [1968].  My mother died in '69 [1969].  So, they did not see me become dean, but they saw me get a Ph.D.  They saw me become--they observed my development into becoming an author.  One of my best books, '[The Urban Challenge:] Poverty and Race' [Robert L. Green] was published when they were alive.  I brought my mother to Washington, D.C. with me at the time.  I had a major book reception, and my mother was just as proud as she could be.  And she came back and told my dad about it.  He wasn't able to travel with us to Washington.  So, they did see me become successful in life.  They--see, my dad died in January of '68 [1968].  [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther] King [Jr.] was assassinated in April of '68 [1968].  But they saw me work for Martin Luther King, Jr.  My mother met Dr. King, my dad never did, and met Coretta Scott King, both my father and mother, on several, several occasions.  Interesting story when my mother helped us when we moved to Atlanta [Georgia], because she took us down to the home site [Haddock Station; Haddock, Georgia], see the house that her dad had built.  And I--she wanted to go to a Church of God in Christ that Sunday when we got returned.  I said, "No, mom, we're going to Ebenezer [Baptist] Church [Atlanta, Georgia].  Dr. King is going to preach Sunday."  He preached every other Sunday.  And she said, "I don't want to hear Dr. King.  I want to have--hear a good, good fiery sermon."  And I said, "Mom, you're going to enjoy the sermon.  You're going to church with me Sunday."  She said, "Oh, I don't want, I want--" So, that next day at staff meeting, I said, "Dr. King," I said, "you have really got to preach Sunday.  I'm bringing my mother to church, and she said only the Church of God in Christ Holiness preacher can preach.  The Baptist preachers can't teach."  And he laughed.  So, that Sunday, we sat in about the fourth row with Coretta Scott King.  And Dr. King preached one of the best sermons ever--not because of the challenge that I tossed out there, but because of his mood at the time.  And he preached on faith and how faith can be the bedrock of the foundation, the social change in America.  You got to have faith in yourself and faith in others.  And he gave, during his sermon, the story of the little boy who had faith.  He--a little old lady walked down the street.  You might have heard this story--and saw this boy holding a string.  But she didn't say, she, she couldn't see what was at the end of the string.  It was a balloon.  So, she said, "Little boy, what are you doing there, holding that string straight up?"  He said, "Because there's a balloon up there."  She said, "How do you know?"  He said, "Because I can feel the tug."  And he said, "We have got to have a tug of faith in our hearts."  And he went on to preach the sermon about faith.  And when he finished, the church was packed that Sunday.  He got a standing ovation, including my mom, and he came over to me and said, "Bob [HistoryMaker Robert Green], how did I do?"  I said, "You did great."

Speaker 1: Is there anything we haven't asked you about that you--now, you've got, you have children, right, you have--
Speaker 2: I have three sons.
Speaker 1: Three sons.
Speaker 2: My oldest son, Vince [R. Vincent Green], is a family law and criminal attorney in Lansing, Michigan, and he has become one of the most noted attorneys in that area.  And he is now doing some collaborative work with the Johnnie Cochran firm.  And Johnnie Cochran is bringing all of his lawyers out to Las Vegas [Nevada] the 9th, 10th, and 11th.  So, his career has done well.  My middle son, Kurt [M. Green], is on the financial side of the entertainment industry, and his strength is royalties.  He's developed a royalty system in which he can track money to make sure that artists are not--no one is discriminated against or cheated really.  My youngest son, Kevin [K. Green], has a Ph.D. in electrical engineering.  And he's in remote sensing, and don't ask me what that means.  I asked him just the other day, "What does that, what does he do--well, what are you doing?  What do you do?"  He's on it with a team of people, a small team in which from the air, thirty-five, forty thousand feet in the air, they could monitor anything on the ground.  They call it remote distance sensing--sensing what's on the ground.  They're working on that system now.  And so, he goes to [U.S.] Air Force bases in Florida and elsewhere.  They do night flights, day flights, and he's the only African American in the world doing what he's doing.  He's a sharp kid.  So, all three of my sons have achieved.  They've gone to the following schools; Michigan State [University, East Lansing, Michigan], [University of] Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan], Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts], University of South Florida [Tampa, Florida], and [George] Washington University in Washington, D.C.  So, I've paid a lot of tuition and they earned a lot of it through scholarships, academic scholarships, and their own hard work.  So, I've been blessed with three, good, fine, young men that my wife gave birth to and helped me raise.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now is there anything we haven't asked you about that you want to raise that you can think of that--
Speaker 2: I think, you know, family life is important and my wife [Lettie Clement Green] helped me create a good family.  I'd like to talk just for a moment about the important role that Coretta Scott King has played and her family.  The Kennedy family has been devastated by death, and the King family felt the wrath of death.  [Reverend Dr.] Martin Luther King, Jr. was assassinated.  His mother [Alberta Williams King] was playing the organ in church on Sunday, and a deranged man shot her and killed her.  Her husband [Reverend Martin Luther King, Sr.] saw it--Daddy King saw it.  [Alread Daniel Williams King] A.D., Martin's brother, drowned.  Darlene, A.D.'s daughter, was out jogging in Atlanta [Georgia] one day and regurgitated and choked to death.  In the context of all of that, Coretta King has done a remarkable job keeping her four kids together and raising them, and to becoming outstanding citizens.  Yolanda [King], the oldest; Martin [Luther King, III]; then Dexter [Scott King], the boy--and a young man, I should say now; and Bernice [King]--all, they're educated kids, smart kids, all doing well, and I don't say that because she's a family friend.  But I saw her kids grow up after the death of her husband.  And from time to time, they would spent time with our, my boys.  When I would go skiing in northern Michigan, I'd take at least three of her kids with us, three of her youngsters with us.  Tennis camps in Colorado and California, they went with us, horseback riding in California.  Whenever I could do anything, I played a supportive role.  It was Coretta Scott King who did a monumental job of keeping monies coming in through speaking engagements, and building The [Martin Luther] King Center [for Nonviolent Social Change, Atlanta, Georgia] with the help of Henry Ford and Coleman Young and the former CEO of Coca-Cola [sic. president Robert Woodruff].  She did a remarkable job--

Speaker 1: Sir, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: I would like to be remembered as a person who did all he could possibly do within the context of my experience, wisdom over the years, to make sure that I improved, in some way, the path for African Americans especially, and other minority groups, to get a good education because I believe education is the best and most effective way to deal with inequality by design.  Inequality as we see it in American life didn't happen haphazardly by chance. It was done by design.  [Dr. Claude S.] Fischer and a group of sociologists, out of the University of California at Berkeley [Berkeley, California], wrote a book, 'Inequality by Design[: Cracking the Bell Curve Myth].'  In it they lay out in a careful, detailed way how policies and practices were put in place to deliberately put people at a disadvantage.  I would like to think my career led to ways in which inequality by design could be eliminated, and equality by design put in place.  That's how I would like to be remembered--one who improved the path for education for African Americans first and other minorities in order to improve their condition in life, and to go back and improve conditions in that community, see me as a strong educator who believed in using education as a force to change society.

Going back to the back, right, far right, my brother, John Green; my brother, Thomas Green; my brother, Havious Green; my sister, Lethia Green; and my sister, Naomi Green.  It's a family photo with--taken about 1941 or '2 [1942] in Detroit, Michigan.  I think, I think, it was '41 [1941] 'cause it was a portrait taken just before my brother, Havious, went into the [U.S.] Army, World War II [WWII].  I'm not sure whether that picture was taken in Detroit [Michigan] or in [Haddock Station; Haddock] Georgia at the home site, but that's my mother, fifteen years of age, in 1915.  And my dad, who was--it's 1918--my dad was probably twenty-two or twenty-three years of age.  I believe he had just returned from France where he fought during World War II, or was on his way there.
Speaker 2: What World (unclear)?
Speaker 1: World War I [WWI], I'm sorry, World War I, it was, um-hm--thanks for the correction.
Speaker 2: My buddy, Suggs Ingram.

Speaker 2: Like, okay, you can see what he's doing in the monitor where he gets framed up in the (unclear).
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  (Unclear).  Are you ready?
Speaker 2: Okay.  Suggs Ingram, sheriff, in Grenada, Mississippi.  We had led a protest march that night against discrimination against blacks, namely, the denial of the right to vote in Grenada.  Suggs knew me because I had hung the Jefferson--the American flag on the Jefferson Davis Monument [ph.] prior to that.  And that was--and made every newspaper in the country, including the New York Times, so they were ready for me.  So, when I came back, I had returned to Michigan State [University, East Lansing, Michigan], but [Reverend] Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] asked me to come back and help organize a protest march about voting rights.  So, I came back, organized the march.  Hosea [Williams] and I were together that night and we were marching near the Jefferson Davis Monument again.  And there must have been, we must have had maybe three to four hundred people in the march.  And young white men, Mississippians, had fish hooks that they put in slingshots--were shooting fish hooks at us.  And one fish hook hit a pretty little black girl from Albany, Georgia in her forehead, and split her forehead.  So, when that happened, I pulled the whole crowd around this furniture store.  It was in the country furniture store and kind of like the town square.  And that store was owned by the richest white man in the area.  And I knew that if I got the marchers up against that plate glass, those plate glass windows, they would stop firing rocks--throwing rocks and bricks at us, and shooting fish hooks at us.  And Suggs Ingram came up to him and said, "Why, why are you creating confusion down here?  Why don't you go back up North?"  I said "Look," I said, "the only reason you're not beating me with that club is because the cameras are on me."  And I said, "Because you're basically a coward," and I called him a coward.  And I knew he wanted to hit me--he wanted to hit me so bad, but you had--CBS was there.  NBC, they, they knew about the march, so I wasn't hit that night.  Below, this is a strategy session in the home of George Washington [Lee] in Canton, Mississippi.  From left is [Reverend] C.K. Steele [Charles Kenzie Steele]--I think he was from Tallahassee [Florida]; [Reverend] Ralph [D.] Abernathy [Sr.]; [Reverend] Bernard Lee, who travelled with Dr. King; Andy Young [HistoryMaker Andrew Young]; myself; Martin Luther King.  The name of the other two men--they escape me now--but they were civil rights workers, tremendous organizers, and Stokely Carmichael [Kwame Ture].  We had been marching in Canton, protesting again the inability of blacks to vote there.  We were tear-gassed that night.  And that was the strategy session we were holding the next day because there was a high level of tension, irritation.  And the Black Power, so-called Black Power Movement, led by Willie Ricks [Mukasa Dada] at that time, was beginning to manifest itself in the march.  And Dr. King was concerned about that, so that was a strategy session.  Here, there's myself to the left.  That's my son, Kevin [K. Green], the youngest son, Kevin, who's a Ph.D. in engineering now.  And that's my dad and my brother, Tom, the medical doctor in the family.  That was taken probably when Kevin was about five years old, and he's forty, so about thirty-five years ago.  The picture here, Martin Luther King, Jr., myself, and Bernard Lee behind me, was announcing a press conference.  That's the press conference I talked about when we got the grant in Chicago [Illinois] to do the literacy training program that--

To the left and right, [Dr.] Walter Adams, a former professor--he's now deceased--at Michigan State and president of Michigan State University.  He was the fourteenth president of the university.  My wife, Lettie [Clement Green], and my good friend, Maynard Jackson, who made many visits to Michigan State to, to tutor, to inspire, and to mentor students at Michigan State University--a good friend of mine.  The great [HistoryMaker] Mr. [Reverend] Jesse [L.] Jackson and Robert L. Green.  I was the president of the University of the District of Columbia in Washington [D.C.] about '83, [1983], '84 [1984].  And Jesse Jackson was announcing his run for the White House [Washington, D.C.] to become president of the United States.  Mayor [Walter] Washington, mayor of Washington, D.C.; Coretta Scott King; Robert J.R. Follett; and myself.  That was when, that was at a book celebration event in Washington, D.C. in which I did a major book signing.  And my book, 'The Urban Challenge: Poverty and Race' [Robert L. Green] was introduced to the national community.  Probably two years after the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr., each year, I would hold what we called the Martin Luther King address at Michigan State, and that year Coretta King spoke.  And it's a press conference with Andrew Young who looks like a little boy, and I need to show him that picture--Coretta Scott King and myself at Michigan State University.  Let's see, King was assassinated in '68 [1968].  That might have been '69 [1969] or '70 [1970], maybe '70 [1970].

Speaker 2: How do you recognize them after the (unclear)?
Speaker 1: Esther [Gordy] Edwards, [HistoryMaker] Berry Gordy's sister; Stevie Wonder; and myself.  Esther Edwards was the one who first picked up Stevie Wonder when he was nine or ten years of age, and actually was the person who travelled with him, and even she bathed him, combed his hair.  She said, oiled him--did everything for him.  And so, when he found out, she invited him to attend an event at The Martin Luther King [Jr.] Center [for Nonviolent Social Change] in Atlanta [Georgia], and she, of course, came.  And I was one of the first ones to invite Stevie Wonder to perform.  He did 'Fingertips' at Michigan State when he was about twelve, and so we were kind of reminiscing about that, and that picture was taken.  This is when I hung that flag in, excuse me--
Speaker 2: That's Grenada, Mississippi, right?
Speaker 1: Yeah, in Grenada, on the Jefferson Davis statute.  And that's what Suggs, Suggs Ingram was for--that would never happen again.  He--Suggs Ingram, Ingram was the sheriff at that time.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  So you didn't want to associate Grenada, Mississippi with the United States of America (laughter)?
Speaker 1: Yeah, I--when I, when I hung that flag up there and I said, "Jefferson Davis will never rise again--we are American."  The mob that cheered the whites went crazy. They went bonkers.  That made every newspaper in the country.

Speaker 1: That was at the, another King event at Michigan State [University, East Lansing, Michigan], probably about 1972.  And so many pictures of Mrs. [Coretta Scott] King.  When Mrs. King again, when [Reverend] Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] was assassinated, as I said yesterday, my wife [Lettie Clement Green] and her even bonded more closely.  And their kids spent a lot of time in our home with our kids, and so she, in turn, would often come to Michigan State University, as our guests.  That picture was taken in my office about 1972, '73 [1973].  I was pondering the Big Ten Athletic discrimination system against athletic officials.  And a young man who worked for me--I think his name was Jason Levet [ph.]--came by my office.  And I was in that kind of pose, and he just snapped a picture, and it turned out to be one of my favorite pictures.  I was young, thin, and handsome then--had hair on my head, never thought I would get old.  Let's--guys, you got to remember you are going to get old one day.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  I think I'm getting there (unclear), to tell the truth.
Speaker 1: Martin Luther King, Jr. invited [Senator Robert F. Kennedy] Bobby Kennedy--I meant, [Senator Edward M.] Ted Kennedy, believe it or not, that is Ted, yeah, looks like Bobby, doesn't he?  That's Ted Kennedy.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Sure is.
Speaker 1: Invited Ted Kennedy to address the SCLC [Southern Christian Leadership Conference] convention in Mississippi.  I think it was in 1964 or '65 [1965].  It had to be after the Public Accommodations Act, so it was '66 [1966], yeah.  It was at the Heidelberg Hotel [Hotel Heidelberg] in Jackson [Mississippi] and we integrated the Heidelberg Hotel.  Left to right is [HistoryMaker Reverend] Walter Fauntroy; Coretta King; Martin Luther King; Ted Kennedy; and [James] Charles Evers; and myself in back of Charles Evers.  And to my knowledge, a buddy of mine took that picture.  I don't know if anyone else has that picture--that's a rare picture.  That was in Jackson, Mississippi at the airport in 1966.  That's my wife's favorite picture.  Hey, Lettie--
Speaker 2: LETTIE GREEN:  Yes.
Speaker 1: Come here.  I want you to see the picture--they're shooting the one that, which you told you loved me and would never leave me.  And whenever my wife would threaten to leave me, I would always bring that picture out and show, show it to her, which has been many, many times.  So, if you hurry up, I'll let you see it.  Stand right over there.  You can't get in front of the camera.
Speaker 2: LETTIE GREEN:  Um-hm.
Speaker 1: That's the picture--when we took it, you said, "I love you; I love you; I'll never leave you."
Speaker 2: LETTIE GREEN:  Oh, dear.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  (Laughter).
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  You're okay?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.
Speaker 2: Coretta King, as I said, was always a very dear friend of Lettie's and myself.  And she wanted to get to meet Henry Ford [II].  And she wanted to know how--in a board meeting--how, how can I get to Henry Ford?  I said, look, I know how I can get you to Henry Ford.  I said, [Clifton R. Wharton, Jr.] Cliff Wharton, who was the president at Michigan State, the first black president, is on Ford's [Ford Motor Company] board.  I'll, I know he'll arrange for you to meet, personally, Henry Ford.  So, I got back to Michigan State.  We had a board meeting in Atlanta.  I went over to Cliff Wharton's office.  I said, "I need a big favor."  I pulled him aside in his office--just the two of us.  I said, "I want you to introduce Coretta King to Henry Ford.  I want to raise some money for The [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] Center [for Nonviolent Social Change, Atlanta, Georgia]."  And he said, "[HistoryMaker] Bob [Robert Green], Henry Ford just committed to help me raise money to build the Wharton Center [for Performing Arts] at Michigan State--I can't go back to him."  I was downhearted, didn't know what to do, and then Coleman Young hit my mind.  I got in my car, drove to Detroit [Michigan], and I told Coleman Young what I wanted.  And Coleman Young set that meeting up.  That's in his home in Detroit in 1978.  That's Martin Luther King, Jr.'s father; that's Henry Ford; that's Coretta King; Coleman Young; and myself.  Had a very interesting experience.  When the meeting ended, we--he had a security guy with him, of course.  We walked--Coleman Young walked him to the door, and I asked Coleman Young, "Could I walk him to the car?"  I walked Henry Ford to the car, and I told him that my dad [Thomas J. Green], how my dad left the South, and went to work for his father [Henry Ford] at five dollars a day.  He was impressed and that's how, that's just a little aside, but to Henry Ford--promised a million [dollars].  He ended up giving and raising about ten to twelve million for Coretta King.  They just really embraced each other in terms of, of respect, respect.
Speaker 1: And this is Henry Ford III, isn't it or--
Speaker 2: That's Henry Ford II.
Speaker 1: The II?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: That's not the original Henry Ford?  That's the--
Speaker 2: That's the old man who founded the company--that's his son.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: That is the man.  He is the one that really--
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  I still just--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  --want to keep it (unclear).
Speaker 2: Lettie.  That's Seaga, the Prime Minister of Jamaica.
Speaker 1: Edward Seaga.
Speaker 2: He invited Coretta King down to Jamaica just to relax and have fun.  And she asked my wife to go with her.  Well, she and my wife, and another person, Doris--I believe it was Doris Ford.  The three of them went down.  And they were there for about ten days, about seven or ten days.  I joined them on the third day.  And that's Coretta King and Seaga at Dunn's [River] Falls [Ocho Rios, Jamaica]--I believe it was, another ocean place.  And Seaga and some of his staff people there with Mrs. King.  I don't know that she's been to Jamaica since that time, but she and Seaga were good friends.  That's it.  Oh, again, that's myself; my wife, Lettie, in the middle; and Coretta Scott King on the beach of, the beaches of Jamaica.  The day is Yazoo [City], Mississippi.  That was during the [James] Meredith March [Against Fear] and that was a stop in Yazoo.  And we were rallying the crowd to stay together.  That was July--that's the date, July 19th, 1966, Yazoo, Mississippi.  That's me pointing.  That's--God, I don't know his name.  He's a very prominent civil rights organizer--I'm blocking on his name.  [HistoryMaker Andrew Young] Andy Young just mentioned his name to me the other day and I just can't, can't recall his name, sorry.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Oh, that's H. Von Watkins [ph.] who was on the board; Leonard Goldstein; to his right would be Murray Pate.  Who's that next to Murray Pate?  Murray Pate--well, it's Murray Pate [ph.], H. Von Watkins.  Then, that was, that's Ernest Taylor [ph.] and Dr. Brauner [ph.] from Alaska.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Do you want me to call out (unclear)?
Speaker 2: That was, again, the Meredith March in Jackson, Mississippi, I believe.  There's Andrew Young and Martin Luther King, Jr., the principals on that, so that would have been about 1966, okay.  Dr. King, on the Meredith March, taking a break, and conversing with civil rights workers from, throughout the country.  Actually, that--whenever there was a big march like that, they attracted marches from throughout the world.  People come from India and everywhere to march.  Okay.  That one, I did.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.
Speaker 2: That was Dr. King's funeral and his casket.  And there, I'm in the middle.  I'm trying to see--
Speaker 1: (Unclear) on that (unclear)?
Speaker 2: I'm trying to see from--
Speaker 1: And that one.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Yeah, you were able to see--
Speaker 1: I'm blocking on his name.  It's Reverend [Dr. Frederick G. Sampson] Fred Sampson, the second from the left.
Speaker 2: (Unclear) Sampson--
Speaker 1: Al Sampson--
Speaker 2: --from Chicago [Illinois]?
Speaker 1: Yeah, um-hm, and myself, and those are the names that I remember right now, uh-hum.  See, how good Andy would know all the--
Speaker 2: What about the top one?  Can you (unclear) on that?
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Oh, we have here--
Speaker 2: Oh, that was at the funeral.  Mahalia Jackson was singing.  That was at that--after the funeral ended, we all marched over to the Morehouse, and we had a little ceremony at Morehouse College [Atlanta, Georgia].  And that's when Mahalia Jackson singing.  I think that's John Doar up top so--
Speaker 1: From the Justice Department [sic. U.S. Department of Justice].
Speaker 2: Um-hm, from the justice department.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  And to the right, maybe get closer to those people to the right.  I don't know who they are.  I think they're probably significant since they're up there.
Speaker 2: Well, there's Andy Young.  (Unclear) there's Andy Young there, leaning over and reaching over.  Again, it looks a little like John Doar up at the top, but the other one, for sure, um-hm.  Dr. [Benjamin] Mays gave the eulogy of his life.
Speaker 1: I think we--that one, and there's the one of Dr. King being arrested.
Speaker 2: Well, that's one that's in a lot of civil rights (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: Yeah, no, no. Not at all.
Story_ID: 203688
Speaker 1: That was during the days of apartheid in Johannesburg, South Africa.  It must have been maybe 1972, '73 [1973].  I'll look to see if there's a date on it because Arthur Ashe was invited to play in a tennis tournament in South Africa.  And he thought it was a chance to integrate Ellis [Park] Stadium [Johannesburg, South Africa] to make a little small impact on segregation in South Africa, and also to meet Nelson Mandela.  So, he has Diggs, Congressman [Charles] Diggs of Michigan, to go with him.  Diggs agreed to go, but then pressure was put on him by the other few remaining black political people to not go to South Africa because of the boycotts that were ongoing at the time.  So, he came to me in Washington [D.C]--I mean in New York (unclear) and said, "[HistoryMaker] Bob [Robert Green], who do you think will go with me?"  He said, "Why don't you go?"  I said, "I know just who will go--it's [HistoryMaker] Andy Young [Andrew Young].  He's courageous, he'll go."  So, I asked Andy to go and he agreed.  You know, we went to South Africa, and he played in the tennis tournament, lost in the finals to Jim McConnell [sic. Jimmy Connors], but we integrated Ellis Stadium for the first time.  He was the first black, first person of color to play in a major sporting events in the stadium.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.
Speaker 1: That is my beloved wife, Lettie [Clement Green]--marriage, August 10th, 1954, San Francisco, California at the church.  The minister's name was Reverend Osborne [ph.].  That's my first born, R. Vincent Green, noted attorney in Lansing, Michigan; undergraduate, University of Colorado [Boulder, Colorado]; law degree, University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan].
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.
Speaker 1: Uhh, terrible.  [HistoryMaker] Willie [L.] Brown, mayor, former mayor of San Francisco, had the audacity to date my wife.  I had--that night, I was in the [U.S.] military, so it had to be about 1955, stationed at the Presidio of San Francisco, and my wife had a formal dance.  She wanted me to take her to the dance.  I had duty assigned that night and couldn't get off.  So, I asked my friend, Willie Brown, who, at that time, probably was a senior at, at San Francisco State College [San Francisco State University, San Francisco, California] if he'd take Lettie to the dance for me--and he did.  So, that's Willie Brown, who later became mayor of San Francisco and assemblyman for the State of California.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.  And that's it.
Speaker 1: And that was out of print, so that I really want that highlighted.  That's imprint.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.
Speaker 1: My first major college text, 'The Urban Challenge: Poverty and Race' [Robert L. Green] published in 1977--at one time used in about seventy-five to eighty universities and colleges around the country.  That's it--published by Follett [Corporation].
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.
Speaker 1: Foreword by Andrew Young and Coretta Scott King.  That publication there is 'ExpectA+ions: (How Student Expectations Can Increase Student Achievement and Assist in Closing the Achievement Gap),' [Robert L. Green] published by McGraw-Hill [Education] in June of 2004.  And it is selling well and making an impact in school districts around the country.
