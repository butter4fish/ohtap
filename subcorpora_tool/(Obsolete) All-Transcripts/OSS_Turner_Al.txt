 Larson Today is October 21, 2014. My name is Mary Larson, and we are here at the  Oklahoma Territorial Museum today with Dr. Alvin Turner. Thank you so  much for being here with us today. I was wondering if you could start by  talking about your upbringing, a little bit about where you were born and  raised.  Turner I was born in Guthrie. We   re in the library portion of the Oklahoma  Territorial Museum, and this was one of my favorite places as a child. My  parents moved out of Guthrie when I was about five to Oklahoma City, but I  returned here for most of my summers until my late teens. I spent a lot of  time in this library and thought Guthrie was the place. I loved it a lot. I  always claimed Guthrie more than Oklahoma City, though. All my public  schooling was Oklahoma City. My parents moved to the City in    47, I think,  maybe    48, after Dad came back from service in the Second World War.  They lived in rental property in southeast Oklahoma City, and there   s a  connection there that   s kind of interesting.  Then moved out to Will Rogers Field while their home was being built on  Southwest 48th, across the street from where U. S. Grant  School  would be  built. That   s where, you know, where I really grew up was in that particular  location on Southwest 48th. A sidebar story here that   s kind of curious is  I   ve just recently taken a small congregation in southwest Oklahoma City,  which is the successor church to the three different Presbyterian churches in  south Oklahoma City, Capitol Hill area and so forth. One of the members  there owned property across the street from where my parents first rented  and knew all the people that I remember from that time when we moved to  the city there on Southeast 22nd Street.  Larson Isn   t that something?  Turner Small world.  5  Larson What did your family do for a living once you go there?  Turner Dad, at that time was a route delivery man for Meadow Gold Milk and  initially drove a horse-drawn wagon and was hired when Meadow Gold got  into servicing grocery stores and restaurants with ice cream. He was the  person who did that for them and did all of Oklahoma City. One of the best  times I had growing up was working with him on weekends, on Saturdays,  and then again in summers when I wasn   t in Guthrie. It   s probably the  closest times I had with my dad, but also I really think I learned to work and  learned to love sorting things and so forth and loved ice cream until lactose  intolerance caught up with me. (Laughter)  Larson How old were you when you first started going on rounds with your dad?  Turner I think seven or eight, somewhere like that. I actually became pretty helpful  to him. I could crawl up in the back of the truck pretty easy, easier than he  could.  Larson You lived in Oklahoma City, and where did you go to school then?  Turner Well, I went to, I started at Willard, which is in southeast Oklahoma City,  and then Will Rogers. Then in the second grade we moved to the house on  Southwest 48th. I had kindergarten at Willard, and first grade at Will Rogers,  then second grade at Millard Fillmore, where I finished elementary school.  Then at that time U. S. Grant had junior high, so I went all the way through  junior high and high school at U. S. Grant across the street.  Larson What was it like having to   you know, you moved schools right in a row  when you were first getting into school. Did that make a difference to you at  the time?  Turner No, I don   t associate any   I don   t have any recall of it being a problem or  anything. I remember the place on Southeast 22nd better than I do the one at  Will Rogers. We were there somewhat longer, but I had a friend there. I   ve  always kind of done   I   ve always been ready to do something different,  anyway, so I suspect that was true then, as well.  Larson Sense of adventure. Where did you   okay, you went to Willard then Will  Rogers, and then   .  Turner Then, Millard Fillmore.  Larson What was that school like? I mean, how big was it?  Turner You know, that we had two classes   . I don   t think there   s any  differentiation between them in terms of quality, but there was two groups  6  of students in each grade level. I don   t know what that meant, roughly three  hundred and fifty students, something like that, maybe a little larger than  that because the class sizes were maybe larger than we might think of. The  thing I remember about that more than anything else is that Oklahoma City  was exploding in that period of time in terms of population and so forth. I  never attended a school that wasn   t in the process of adding on buildings.  For instance, at least two of the years I was at Millard Fillmore, we were in  converted Army barracks, and when they built Grant, even after they built it,  they were using converted barracks and other prefabricated buildings in  order to accommodate the surge of population that was taking place.  That also had the other memory I had. This is their fault, my fault, your  fault, you know. Nobody   s talking about fault here. The public schools of  Oklahoma City were under a tremendous amount of pressure, I think,  finding teachers, so my experience with teachers was mixed. As I say, that  was one of those things that was the system, but it   s not only the people who  were questionably qualified. I did not fit into that environment. I think  what   s happening is that that infusion of population, its rural values coming  into a different setting and didn   t quite fit in the urban expectation. There  was those kinds of conflicts built in. I just have never fit very well into  anything that restrained me for very long.  I   m ADD, and they didn   t know that then. I   m not sure I had a name for it,  but I was very restless. Some of my teachers learned to   . Like one year,  one of the more problematic years I had at Millard Fillmore was they finally  decided that they   d let me go down and do the attendance records in the  afternoon and so forth. Then another time, I had a teacher that just finally  started bringing in books and letting me go over in the corner and read all  day. I was basically starting to have real problems fitting into that life. In  some respects, it got worse. I   ve always said that if there was a special hell  designed for me it would consist of high school. (Laughter) I was not a  happy camper in public schools.  Larson Did you have any teachers who did light a spark for you?  Turner I had teachers that I liked. I don   t think of any of them as really   . Maybe  one kind of embodied a, I   m going to say two, kind of embodied a scholarly  quality that I at least leaned toward. One of them was Jim Cox, who taught  history at Grant, and the other was Marvin York, who taught English.  Marvin subsequently had a career in the Oklahoma State Senate. He was  working on his law degree, in fact, when he was teaching English at Grant. I  was impressed by Marvin. There was a qualitative difference in those two  people that I was drawn to. Otherwise, I just basically   they were who they  were. Sometimes that meant that I had problem with them, but I didn   t think  that was their fault, necessarily. (Laughs)  7  Larson Was that influx into the public school system and into Oklahoma City, was  that a result of the post-war   .  Turner Sure, sure, post-war population shifts and so forth. In fact, it had been taking  place during the war with wartime industry and stuff. I can remember, for  instance again with Dad in the early   50s, one time for some reason he took  a truckload of ice cream out, maybe to Clinton or someplace like that. We  went out very early in the morning. Going out there, it was a steady line of  traffic on Route 66 of people coming to work in Oklahoma City. Well,  within a few years, those people had moved to Oklahoma City. I mean, there  was still some that commuted, but very quickly that started to change.  Larson Do you think the drought in the   50s, especially in the western part of the  state, had anything to do with that?  Turner You know, I don   t know. The   50s drought was worse than the one of the    30s, but I don   t think, I   ve never thought about it, how much this location  had had. Of course, it   s hard to pinpoint it because the pattern has been so  widespread. It   s just been exponential by years almost, in terms of the  number of people who are flushing out of agriculture, so there   s all kinds of  influences, including better highways.  Larson Now, when you were in high school, were you involved in any activities  or   .  Turner I went out for football, and I wasn   t any good at it. I just wasn   t any good at  it. I was in the junior-senior play. Basically, I worked. I was a paperboy, that  sort of stuff.  Larson That kept you plenty busy.  Turner Yeah.  Larson What are your most vivid memories from your high school years? You said  if there was a special hell for each person, yours would probably be high  school, so maybe this isn   t the question to ask.  Turner That   s interesting. I don   t have any really vivid memories from that period  of time. I just kind of let it wash away. Although, one of the three biggest  surprises of my adult life is that after the fiftieth class reunion, a group  decided they   d start meeting regularly and eat breakfast one Monday a  month in south Oklahoma City. I   ve joined that group and kind of enjoyed  being around them. Some of those people, of course, I   ve known since  Millard Fillmore. There   s still a bond with my classmates and stuff, but I  didn   t like it.  8  Larson What did you do after high school?  Turner I worked a year. I did things like, well, actually, two different things. I  worked up in Ponca City and worked on grain elevator repair for a while.  Then I did a summer at OBU  Oklahoma Baptist University  and got   then  joined the army and spent three years in the service. Good investment.  Larson Where were you with the Army, I mean, in terms of basic   .  Turner I spent most of my time at Fort Huachuca Arizona in southern Arizona and  then a year in Korea. Army turned out to be a very good investment. I often  say that it was, (and I think this was a common experience for a lot of  people) it was an opportunity to grow up, but it was also, provided two other  benefits. One of them was pretty obvious, and that is the GI Bill because I  left service right after the Vietnam declaration was made, the Gulf of Tonkin  Resolution. That put me in under GI Bill benefits that kicked in part of the  way through my college work. That was very helpful. As a matter of fact,  what it meant was that I was able to do a lot more, quicker. The other thing  is that   I don   t think anybody   s ever understood when I tell them this, but  I   ll tell you that anyway. The Army was three years in which nobody was  messing with my head, in which I was able to just pretty much think things  out and kind of decide. I didn   t understand how social relationships worked  very well. I just didn   t know how to fit in. I just really sat down and kind of  thought through some things and thought,    Okay, well, here   s what you do  in those instances.    I came out kind of better prepared to fit into the world  than I was.  Larson What was your time in Korea like?  Turner You know, it was just basically a routine job but in a different place. Of  course, I was there in    63,    64, at which time you could still see visible  evidence of the war. In fact, the compound I stationed at was pretty close to  one of the really heavy battles. In that period of time, for instance, there was  real penalties on chopping down any trees, on cutting lumber and so forth  because the trees had been destroyed by the war. I was very impressed with  the Korean people, the hard work and that sort of thing. I remember a  number of the US forces in that period then, as well as now, worked with  KATUSA, which is the Korean Augmentation of the United States Army.  Many of them would talk about that they had been raised by people that   .  Literally what would happen is the destruction of the war. Then people  would just gather up children and raise them as their own. That   s one of the  few places I   d like to go back to that I haven   t.  Larson What was that like, coming from Guthrie and Oklahoma City? Was that  your first experience with a really different culture, or was the Army your  first experience with a really different culture?  9  Turner I think that was not the first with that different of culture, but   . That   s an  interesting question because I don   t think of myself as just being that much  in awe of it or anything. It was different. I wanted to learn about it and see  what they were doing and how they were different and so forth. I think in  some respects I was prepared for a bigger world than that sketch I   ve given  you might have   and it came from two different things. My family took  trips with my grandparents. The ones who lived here in Guthrie and my  folks would get together once a year and pool their resources. We would  travel to my mother   s older sister   s residence, which, in the early   50s was  in Grand Marais, Minnesota, which is on the far reaches of the north shore  of Lake Superior. I still think God lives there. (Laughter) I had the exposure  to that kind of very different world and cultural differences, as well. I mean,  this is north woods culture, still wood-burning stoves. Of course, I grew up  around some of that in rural Oklahoma, as well. Then they moved to Naples,  Florida, so I had that kind of diversity of experience. I can remember  traveling with the parents, and then one time on a bus trip through the Deep  South and just being   . That was a different culture. That was a different  world, and interestingly enough it was one that threatened me a lot more, in  terms of just trying to get my head around it, than Korea did.  Larson That   s interesting. You said you had a chance to think things through when  you were in the Army. What conclusions did you come to? I mean, what did,  what was your plan getting out?  Turner My plan was to find a woman. (Laughs)  Larson That goes to that part of the story.  Turner I had a list. (Laughter) I really did. I thought, what is it that   . I had dated a  girl in high school. In some respects, she brought me out of that kind of shell  that I   d formed. We are still friends. She   s one of those people that I owe a  real debt to. She kind of had a, I think of it as (what do you call it) a rescue  for men. (Laughs) There were three or four of us that she rescued. She,  incidentally, is still the director for Habitat  for Humanity  of Oklahoma  County. Her name now is Fenton. No, it   s not. It   s Gilliland. Fenton died.  Anyway, I sat down, and I thought that, you know, being around Ann, I  thought,    I definitely need a woman in my life.    I made a list of the qualities  that I wanted and what I didn   t want to mess with. I convinced myself that I  wasn   t totally unattractive. I proceeded on those assumptions and got lucky.  Larson Was this right after you got out of military?  Turner Yeah. When I got out of the service, I got out early to go back to college.  Started at Central State  University of Central Oklahoma  and dated some. I  10  think I met Carmelita probably within that first year, and we started dating  the second semester I was at Central State.  Larson How did you two meet?  Turner At the BSU, Baptist Student Union, at Central State, which was a unique  institution in that place and time. BSUs, of course, were ubiquitous in  Oklahoma, and even more so later. Although, they   ve folded them up quite a  bit in the last few years. We had an advisor there by the name of Whit field   Marks, who was the chairman of the physics department at Central at that  time. Whit   s still alive. Whit was   but also Gene McBride, who was the  leader, and Jeanie, his wife, they were very bright and open, encouraging  people. It was a different quality of fellowship. Whit, for instance, was  probably the seminal influence that urged me to take that critical, academic  skills and so forth and apply them to study a Bible and related issues and  concerns. That would be one of those other people on my short list of  people. That   s the reason I wrote the L. W. Marks biography because Marks  was Whit   s namesake and grandfather.  Larson Well, we   ll get back to that one later in the interview. When you came out of  the service, your main plan was     Turner Just to get a degree. I didn   t know what I wanted to do, and I didn   t know  what I wanted to study. I have this tendency to not do that systematic  analysis. I kind of plow along, and then I   ll occasionally sit down.  Sometimes people have to ask me a question, and then I   ll figure out what I  want to do. I knew that I wanted to do something professional, and I knew I  didn   t want to be a preacher. In the Baptist culture that I grew up in, any  bright kid who had some gift of speaking, they thought of us as preacher  boys. I tried a lot of that, but I realized what I was doing was imitative in  some way or another, not authentic, so I didn   t do it. I knew that that wasn   t  it, although I still tried some of that.  I just didn   t know what I could do, so I thought about teaching, which was  the one profession I   d had something to do with. I still didn   t know what. I  was drawn to three areas of study, four, actually: political science, English,  (the literature) history, and humanities. I got to the eightieth hour or so when  I enrolled, and they said I had to declare a major. At that point, I analyzed  the situation.    You couldn   t get a degree in humanities. You get a degree in  English, you   re going to grade English papers, eighth grade.    Political  science, there were other barriers, so I chose history and focused on it. I  wound up with a history degree and an English minor and enough hours, and  took all the humanities they offered and all the political science, enough  hours almost for a degree in political science, too.  11  Larson We were fortunate you ended up on the path you did. (Laughs) Might have  gone another way.  Turner In more ways than one. History really fit that need for change and different  ways of approaching things and so forth much more than any other thing  that I was interested in. The other area that I was drawn to, if I   d have  known that it was out there, it would have been a temptation. I did not  understand that there was an academic area study called religion. I thought  of it in terms of   this sounds like I grew up in a pumpkin patch or  something. (Laughs) In southwest Oklahoma City, by and large, and to some  extent kind of an anti-social kid, anyway, there just was not a whole lot of  modeling going on. I knew  four  professions: medicine, law,   ministry,  and teaching. I   ve always been drawn to two of those. Law was the other  one that I was somewhat drawn in. That was in the cards as a possibility.  I   m glad I didn   t do that, either. Anyway, I would have been interested in  studying religion, but I   m glad I didn   t go there, too.  Larson Where did you live when you were in college?  Turner In Edmond. The first semester, I commuted from my folks    place. Then I got  an apartment or a room that I shared with a guy. In fact, moved him out to  move Carmelita in whenever we got married.  Larson When did you folks get married?  Turner We got married in December of 1965. We got impatient.  Larson Well, that probably, being married in college gave you a different, probably  gave you a different lens on things than if you   d been going through as the  standard undergrad, but having been in the military, you probably had a  different lens on things, anyway.  Turner The other thing is I worked full-time. I remember I told them that I wouldn   t  wear a beanie, and I wouldn   t. (Laughs) Nobody wanted to try to put one on  me. I was fierce-looking in that period of time. I   ve got to tell a story. After  Carmelita and I were married, one time some occasion came up, and I pulled  out my student ID. She looked at it, and she blushed. I said,    What was that  about?    She said,    I remember you.    (Laughs) She had been the assistant to  the photographer who took the IDs, and she was supposed to tell me to take  off my sunglasses. I was so fierce-looking that she wouldn   t tell me that I  was supposed to take off my sunglasses. I worked full-time at a machine  shop in Oklahoma City and then at different other jobs all the way through  my undergraduate work.  Larson Did that make it tough trying to get the courses you want scheduled?  12  Turner No, no. To some extent until well in my forties, I always had more energy  than I knew what to do with. It didn   t work as well in graduate school, but I  needed a lot of framing of my time and energy. If I was working forty hours  a week, that meant that I would focus when I needed to to get to my studies  and so forth. It worked pretty well for me.  Larson I know a lot of people who it   s taken much longer than that to figure out  what it is they need to do to structure their time and get themselves   . For  some people, it takes a lot longer to kind of identify how we work best.  Turner You know, it   s funny. I didn   t know. That was not a strategy. That was just  my way of plowing through things, but it turned out to be the right way to  do it.  Larson Well, what about grad school? Once you were done as an undergrad, did  you know what   .  Turner Well, we went to Kansas City and spent two years in Kansas City Public  Schools: one year teaching English and the other teaching social studies. I  learned that I was not a public school teacher, and really was not. It was an  important experience, though, in other respects in that I spent those two  years in inner city schools, not a total disaster but certainly not a  comfortable one, either. I think that it was important in terms of gaining  some sympathies toward that particular, those circumstances. During that  time, I finished my master   s at Central Missouri State, and then began  thinking about graduate school   about doctoral work. I guess at some point  in there, I decided that I wanted to try to teach college. That had to be it, but  I don   t remember that being the conclusion. I originally wanted to go to  Kansas State, which had an American Studies program. No, I   m getting this  wrong.  I wanted to go to Kansas University, which had an American Studies  program, but they had a backlog, a backlist. Then I looked at Kansas State,  and I looked at Oklahoma State and came to Oklahoma State. Part of the  reason I came to Oklahoma State was because the chairman there was  Homer Knight at that time. I came in and introduced myself and was  visiting. Homer noticed that I had a pipe and shared some of his tobacco  with me. We sat there and smoked and talked. It was kind of a cool place. I  liked Homer. He was a good man. In contrast, when I had done my  undergraduate work at Central State, I looked at graduate school for a while  at that point. Dick Peters, who was one of the best teachers I ever had at  Central State, taught European History. Dick encouraged me to apply at OU  and sent me down with a letter of reference and so forth. They kind of told  me,    Yeah, you can come here if you want to. We don   t care, really.     (Laughs) I got a different impression, totally, from Homer.  13  Larson It sounds like it. I   m sure you had been to the campus there before.  Turner OSU? No, never had.  Larson No? What were your first impressions?  Turner You know, I liked the cookies in the Student Union. They had great oatmeal  cookies. I loved the library there. That library, even to this day   of course,  living where I do now, I do more research with the OU library. What I enjoy  at OU library is what I liked about the OSU, as well, was the stacks and that  sort of stuff, and just the size and scope of it. There   s something that   I like  being surrounded by books. I just go through and read shelves in reasonable  approximate areas of interest and so forth. In fact, I got to tell you that when  I did comps at OSU, (this is getting ahead of the story) my graduate advisor,  he knew me pretty well. He said,    What I want you to do is I want you to  make a list of the books that you   re familiar with, that are most likely to  show up in your comprehensive exams in the areas, and if you can   t identify  the major thesis and some of the principal arguments of the books, I want  you to go and pull those books and no others. Don   t get started on anything  else. Focus.    (Laughter) I did, and it was good advice.  Larson What was the History Department like when you got there? You mentioned  Homer Knight.  Turner Yeah, that   s the last thing I really had to do with Homer. Homer   s kind of a  grandfather in the background and shepherding. It   s a very congenial  department. I never felt like I was, you know, the   and this was a particular  person at OU. I   m not bad-mouthing them. The particular person that I dealt  with at OU, he really didn   t want to mess with students. I never got that  from any of the people at OSU. I think, by and large they had bought into a  mission. In that period of time was right when that doctoral program began.  I think I came in   I don   t know when it came in, but probably the late   60s.  I came in in    70, so it had just really gotten started. There was maybe one or  two classes ahead of me. They were excited about it and believed in what  they were doing. This was a real time of   . History as a discipline was  flowering at that particular point, and everybody, I think, was happy to be a  part of that.  Larson Were there particular professors that you remember especially?  Turner Well, Odie Faulk became the chair after Homer retired, and Odie is one of  those very memorable people who did an incredible amount of good for that  department, an incredible amount of good for most of the students, and an  incredible amount of harm in the process. I think of Odie as a Nixon  character, psychologically as well as the impact of his policies. He was a  gifted guy, a good narrative historian, and that   s the distinction I want to  14  come back to in a minute. He was still at war. He never was comfortable in  his own person or in his relationship to his profession. He was important to  us in encouraging us to write, and in some instances teaching us to write. I  think that everybody who went through in some way or another was  impacted by that. Odie was not on my graduate committee, for instance, but  nevertheless was one of the major influences for me. I said he wasn   t.  Anyway, he might have been on my committee. I don   t remember that. I   ll  have to think about that a minute.  The other person who made that department work and who gave us all  careers was LeRoy Fischer. I dreaded taking classes from LeRoy because he  was very systematic. You did everything on a weekly schedule, and   I  didn   t do it. (Laughs) I made a B for one of LeRoy   s classes that I took  because I wouldn   t read on his schedule. He was, nevertheless, not in the  classroom but just in terms of the modeling of and the encouragement and  the provision of some of the writing projects   . The first article, I guess, that  I had published was an issue that LeRoy put together for the Journal of the  West and using students from his seminar to do that. Leroy, of course, was  just the key figure. You can   t move Odie out of that equation. For the others  who went on to become something in the state history, the one person from  those that I was associated with, out of all the people came through OSU,  there   s only one who would be recognized at the AHA  American History  Association  or comparable national organization. That   s Gary Moulton.  Do you know Gary? He did the Lewis and Clark papers. Anyway, Fischer,  again, is the key there for Gary. Now, Gary might talk about somebody else,  as well, but I think he would certainly acknowledge that. LeRoy is the key to  Kenny Franks and Bob Blackburn, Paul Lambert. I don   t know where he fits  with Kenny Brown. Those three that I just named, in some respects,  represent the real core of the impact of the OSU Department of History on  Oklahoma history. I got to tell you my favorite LeRoy story. This one needs  to be recorded somewhere. LeRoy was different. One time in class, for  instance, he couldn   t decide which ones he would grade first, so he threw  them out   threw out the stack of papers. Then went and sorted them   .  He   d do weird things like that. That might have been the instance that  triggered it, but there was a group of us sitting around the graduate student  area. We were talking.  We wondered if LeRoy was senile, at which point I think it was Norbert  Mahnken, stuck his head in the room. We thought,    Oh, we burned our  bridges now.    Mahnken said,    I heard what you guys are talking about. I  want to tell you that LeRoy is not getting senile. LeRoy has always acted  senile.    (Laughs) That may be a slight version of it, but in effect that was  what he said. For me, Mahnken, he was my graduate advisor. I   m one of two  PhDs that Norbert produced. The other one is Tom Isern, who is the other  person other than Gary Moulton who might be recognized outside of  15  Oklahoma. Now, I say that. I had quite a bit of interface with scholars in  Kansas and Texas. I   m sure Bob is known as the historical society director  outside the state, but as historians, by and large most of us have been  primarily defined by Oklahoma topics and connections.  Larson Do you think that was the case with most of the faculty members who were  there at the time? Was that a departmental focus?  Turner I don   t know, and I don   t know what they were working on. I know that  many of them wound up doing Oklahoma stuff. LeRoy definitely did. That  was his focus. Even Doug Hale eventually did some Oklahoma materials  and some Western materials. He did that thing on Texas cavalry or  something. In some respects, Doug was going back to his roots when he did  that. Michael Smith did The Mexicans in Oklahoma with the Oklahoma  Image series. I think that there was a lot of that but not completely. I don   t  know that   Joe Stout was actually one of the first, maybe the first person to  come through the OSU doctoral program and then came back as faculty. I  don   t know that Joe ever did anything on Oklahoma. On the other hand, I   m  not a good person on these topics other than the three or four I   ve been  talking about because I don   t have a sense of what they were doing, what  they   ve done. I   m not a r  sum   reader. There certainly was a strong pressure  there. That, in fact, had been the rationale for the creation of the doctoral  program at OSU was that it would fill state needs. It   s certainly done that.  Larson Do you think there was more of a public history emphasis, or was public  history not quite public history?  Turner You know, I didn   t hear about public history until long after I   d become  one. (Laughs) In fact, I   d read about it and didn   t quite attach that to me, but  Sally Soule introduced me one time as a public historian. I thought,    Well,  that fits,    because that is kind of the niche that I   d filled out there in the  community at large. I don   t think that was the sense of it. I think that the  Oklahoma Historical Society (OHS) and the Oklahoma Heritage Association  provided that framework for Bob, Kenny, and Paul Lambert. I guess that  would be a connectedness there, but I don   t think that was the intent of the  program. I may be misguided there. I think most of us initially thought about  college careers, but then LeRoy was very influential in those appointments,  as well.  Larson I wanted to go back to something you mentioned earlier. You mentioned  Odie Faulk and his role as a narrative historian. Do you want to talk about  that?  Turner I will. I want to make one other qualification about Odie. The other thing  that Odie did a superb job of was Odie went out and worked the field. I will  almost guarantee you that he was the only history department chair in ten  16  states of his generation who was out meeting with junior college faculties  and that sort of stuff. As a result, I think that that was kind of the seed work  that got me my first position. By the time I got out, the academic market had  just absolutely deteriorated. I mean, it was dead. Odie was still able to find  some places for us. I wanted to focus on that distinction as well because I  think it   s an important one. I think narrative history is very important. I   m  not deprecating it, but there is a difference between narrative and  interpretive historians. By and large, most of the ones who came out of OSU  are narrative historians probably because of the Faulk influence, but also  Fischer is primarily oriented that way, perhaps less so than Odie, even. I  don   t fit that for a number of reasons, but I don   t. Bob Blackburn doesn   t,  either, completely.  Bob   s got a pretty strong interpretive bent to him as well. I mean, any of  them do it. It   s just their basic orientation. Gary obviously does. I think that  the orientation has been more of a   . That may be what Oklahoma history  has called for. The first article that I published after that one in the Journal  of the West, that special edition LeRoy edited, was one for Prairie Lore,  which is a little regional publication in southwest Oklahoma. I did an article  on Humphreys, Oklahoma, which is where I was preaching at a little Baptist  church there. I got to close that one down for them. Just did a little historical  sketch of Humphreys and sent it off to Prairie Lore. He was happy to get it,  (I think his name was Hugh Corwin) he said, but he wanted    more history.     I thought,    What in the world does he want?    I went and looked at some of  the articles, and what he wanted is more names. I think that that is the  expectation of regional and local history, and therefore a pretty good  argument against my argument about the importance of local history in  terms of the larger narrative.  Larson That   s something we   ll actually get back to later on. How do you think, you  talked a little bit about this, but how do you think the department at OSU,  besides just personalities, compared to other programs in the state at the  time?  Turner I think that it was different in terms of its orientation. I think, by and large, it  was preparing people for Oklahoma work. That may have meant that it was  public history, whereas the folks at   . One of my best friends, in fact, would  confirm this, was really discouraged from going to work at a junior college.  We weren   t. I think that that   s a different orientation, you know, more of a  working man   s historian maybe, whereas OU was posturing that,    We want  to get you to the next here,    or something like that.  Larson Do you think that had to do a little bit with maybe the national sense at the  time?  Turner I think so.  17  Larson There was a little more of that history from the bottom up.  Turner Well, I think history from the bottom up was more what   s happening at OSU  because it   s new and it can do it, although it wasn   t really thought of that  way at that point, whereas OU   s still going to be more hidebound by what it  had been before. In fact, OU in that period of time in the history department  and soon to be OU Press, even, and certainly in the art department, is out  with the old and in with the new. This is the period of time in which the  Jacobson legacy at OU   s being kind of covered up. In fact, I worked later  with the Oklahoma Museums Association with Sam Olkinetsky, who is a  modern artist and director of the museum. They were consciously covering  the, or moving away from the legacy of Oscar Jacobson, who had been a  regionalist. Similarly, the history department was trying to get rid of the  image of E. E. Dale. As a result, Arrell Gibson was never at home at OU.  Partly, that   s his fault. Usually if people are at odds, it   s their fault as well as  somebody else   s. They would   ve just as soon had somebody maybe a little  less prominent and certainly a little less regional than Arrell was.  Larson I think in grad school all of us end up reading something that changes  entirely how we think about what we do. Was there something like that for  you in grad school?  Turner You know, I don   t think it was in grad school. I think that the reading that I  did that really changed the way in which I was thinking about history was in  preparation for a class I taught. When I started teaching down at Altus,  Central State tried a program at Altus Air Force Base, and they offered some  upper division courses. I taught one for them called Great Men in American  History, which is a delightful title in terms of today   s sensibilities. I read a  series of biographies, and I realized that in some respects I felt I was reading  the kind of history that I was most interested in reading. That   s interesting  because I have that interpretive bent. I just felt like that the life narrative  allowed me to understand the larger picture that I was really after. I read  widely. At that time, I was reading probably ten books a week. I was  fascinated with all of the major historians of that period, but none of them  drew me like those biographies did. Verner Crane and  Edmund  Morgan,  life of  John  Winthrop, that   s still one of the books that   . Interestingly  enough, I   ve talked to, I said that one time to David Levy at OU and Davis  Joyce, who is an OU graduate. Davis is a friend of mine, my best friend. I  said something about that, and they all hit on that as well, said,    Oh, wow.     That was a very influential book for them, as well.  Larson I guess this is jumping ahead just a little bit, but when you did your work on  L. W. Marks, was that sort of a similar approach to reflect other things that  were going on historically through a life history?  18  Turner Exactly, exactly, right. Yeah, I couldn   t have written,    He did this this  Sunday and this that next Sunday.    I didn   t want to do that.  Larson Let   s talk a little bit, I guess, about what you did after you finished your  coursework at OSU.  Turner I left before I finished the doctorate, and financial pressure was the major  reason. In fact, I tried in   72 to leave because I   d finished virtually all my  coursework at that point. That   s when the job market crashed. I sent out four  hundred letters and didn   t get an interview. At that point, I was exploring all  kinds of things. I looked at full-time ministry, and I looked at selling stock.  Boy, it was a scary time. I came back for another year. The GI Bill ran out in  that period, but I was working and going to school and doing some things.  Carmelita had to work that last year in order for us to pull that one together,  and we had two babies in that period of time. (Laughs) That   s a story that  might as well be mentioned here, too.  Larson Yep, time to bring the kids in.  Turner We adopted Megan, and nine months and five days later, Nathan arrived.  (Laughs) We had those in graduate school. She worked that last year. She  worked at the library for a semester. I forgot where that question was going.  I went down to Altus for four years at what was then Altus Junior College,  which became Western Oklahoma State College. Spent four years there.  Homer Knight did me a great service, but he also said something one time  that was probably the worst thing that could have ever been said to me. He  said,    Nobody tells a historian what to do.    I alienated a lot of people at  Altus. They were wrong and I was right, but I didn   t do it right. Had a  chairman there one time tell me that I was teaching philosophy rather than  history. I asked him why he thought what he was doing was teaching when  what he was doing was, you know, they could follow him with the  underlining from the last semester in the books. Some reason or another, he  took offense at that. (Laughs)  We had a president at that period of time who literally was threatened by  doctoral people. He discouraged us from pursuing it any further. I don   t  know why he agreed to hire me in the first place, and a few others in that  period of time. Virtually all of us left. There was a core of us young Turks,  all of us thinking we wanted to have governance. That was the participation  in governance. That was the movement of the hour, which was the stupidest  thing that faculty have ever wanted to do. You look at the bane of faculty  existence for the next forty years in higher education. It is committee work  and that kind of thing. We were all saying,    Oh, yeah, we need to be more  participatory.    Dumb. Carmelita didn   t like Altus, either. Although, in some  respects, I maintained a strong Altus connection. A lot of the work, lectures,  and humanities work and so forth could be connected to Altus. My current  19  research project is Altus-rooted as well. I   m looking at old Greer County.  Four years teaching at Altus Junior College, during which time it became  Western Oklahoma State College.  In some respects, the Altus experience was another of those very important  ones because it   s where I first got associated with the work of the Oklahoma  Humanities Council (OHC). Actually, there   s two stories around this theme.  I was suspicious of the Oklahoma Humanities Council to start with because  they had at that time, still do have, the Shortgrass Arts and Humanities  Council. The director came to me and asked me if I   d be their academic  humanist for a project. I said,    Well, I   m not a humanist,    and I   m not.  (Laughs) She understood what I was saying and said,    We   re talking about a  humanities scholar.    I said,    Oh, okay, I   ll be happy to do that.    That  confusion is one that still has handicapped the humanities all along. It   s  equivalent to what I have to   I always apologize anytime some of my  family or friends visit me in a Presbyterian congregation. I tell them in the  Apostles    Creed that we talk about the Holy Catholic church that we   re not  talking about the Roman Catholic church, the humanist term.  Anyway, I became involved with a number of programs with Shortgrass  Arts and Humanities Council, and then eventually started writing grants. In  fact, the project that took me away from Altus was a statewide project of the  state department, Oklahoma Department of Libraries (ODL). It   s called  Gaylord Sirs, which was to plant programs in libraries across the state of  Oklahoma. I worked on that. That was one of the opportunities, one of the  things that I worked on the last year I was at Altus, by which time I decided  it   s time for me to leave there. Ultimately, I wound up being on, I think I  was either a part of or wrote sixty different grants for the Oklahoma  Humanities Council and would serve on that board. Too, we   ll need to talk  more about that when we talk about the Oklahoma Museums Association  (OMA). In fact, the job that I    had    when I left Altus that I thought would  be a transition for me to get into something else, I just left, which is stupid,  but I did it.  I had a summer grant to do a series of humanities programs in Woodward. A  group in Woodward, the Four Ws: Women Who Want to be Women,  associated with a local Church of Christ, spooked the Woodward librarian,  saying,    We don   t want this godless humanism in our community.    I met  with that group and convinced them that I was not a godless humanist, but  by that time the librarian was spooked. We did not complete the program,  and I wound up cleaning apartments that summer. In fact, I asked for an  afternoon off from cleaning apartments in Norman. We lived in Noble; we   d  moved to Noble. The manager asked me what I needed it off for, and I said,     To go get my PhD.    (Laughs) We went to Stillwater and got my doctorate  and went back to cleaning apartments. I   ve been back to Altus a lot and  20  continued to do humanities programs and research projects at the museum  there, and, as I say, I   m currently working on Greer County.  Larson We can talk a little bit more about that once we get a little further along.  From your CV, it looks like you might have started working on the  Oklahoma Image Project about the time you were finishing your doctorate.  Turner What happened was Kathy Hale at the Southern Prairie Library System and  I came up with a project that we thought would carry us over, that, in fact,  would create a job for me after I left Altus. That wasn   t the reason we did it.  We wanted to do Oklahoma Image, in which we wanted to explore the  overall image of the state, how it perceives itself, how it is perceived abroad,  and similar kinds of things. We got a grant from OHC to do that. That didn   t  kick in until September, so that   s the reason I was cleaning apartments in the  summer and had hoped to be doing humanities programming in Woodward.  What happened with that was I probably didn   t present it well. Anyway, we  had a meeting with the director of the ODL and the board there. I think that  they went out real quickly and got Ann Morgan to come in because they  wanted to go after an NEH  National Endowment for the Humanities  grant  to do Oklahoma Image and thought that she would be better connected to do  that.  I agreed with that. She definitely was better connected. I became assistant  project director for Oklahoma Image, which did not work well for a lot of  reasons. During that time, I did do one project for the Image, and that is that  I went around and studied regional archival collections in libraries and state  repositories and that sort of thing and defined them roughly in that. At the  end of that year, close to the end of that semester of work, during which  time they were waiting for the NEH approval for the Oklahoma Image grant,  I went to work for the Oklahoma Museums Association. Now, Oklahoma  Image, I think made a major contribution to Oklahoma. I think the ten series  on different ethnic groups in Oklahoma and is an important contribution. I  think that the exhibit, this was not the project I would have wanted.  I still think that the exhibit was a good example of something that was an  awful lot of work and an awful lot of cost that really didn   t have much to  address what I think is still to some extent a concern in Oklahoma. That is  the way in which we see ourselves and the way in which we present  ourselves to others. I don   t think that there would have been a project that  could have done anything to address that, actually, but I think we could have  done something different than  what was done . Nevertheless, I think  Oklahoma Image did do some good things. The Oklahoma Image materials  guide that Anne put together was helpful to a lot of people, as well.  Anyway, then I went to work for the Oklahoma Museums Association.  21  Larson Now, that was fairly soon after   I mean, you were the executive director,  and that was not too long after they were formed.  Turner Yeah, they had been   that   s not quite right. The Oklahoma Museums  Association had been in existence for years, but they had gotten an NEH  grant to hire a professional. There were five states at that point that were   it  was a project to see what would happen if they got professionals. They hired  a woman by the name of Robin Tryloff, who had been the director for, I  think, two and a half years roughly, maybe two years. I   m not sure of my  chronology on this. Robin left, at which point the board was going through a  crisis in that they deposed the previous chairman and elected Sam  Olkinetsky as chairman of the Oklahoma Museums Association. They also  were trying to clean up the paperwork on the grant and so forth, and they  needed somebody who could devote to that. I was hired to do that. The  assumption was that it wasn   t going to work, that the professional, they  couldn   t find a way to engender the support that the NEH grant expected  they would.  Texas had been able to generate its support for continuity. Oklahoma had  not. I told them I thought we could, and what I had in mind worked.  Somebody else might have a different interpretation, but I don   t think so. I  think I really showed them how to save the professional wing of the  Oklahoma Museums Association. That is, we went after grants. We did two  blockbuster grants in that period of time. We did the Will Rogers traveling  exhibit, in which we took materials pertaining to Will Rogers    centennial.  This would have been    79, the centennial of his birthday. Took materials and  loaded them up in the back of a truck and created an exhibit in the back of a  semi-trailer and hauled it all over the state of Oklahoma. I don   t remember  the numbers, but, you know, certainly probably close to a hundred thousand  people went through that exhibit. The Humanities Council was more than  pleased with the results of that.  Then the next year, Mary Ann Anders had a brainstorm, wanted to do folk  art in Oklahoma. We pulled together a grant to do that and had a statewide  exhibit on that, as well, but limited showing. I think it only showed at what  was then the Oklahoma Art Center. Then a small publication out of that, by  which time I had run out of ideas and didn   t have a   . I   m a much better  idea person than I am an implementer. I couldn   t find anything to really  keep myself busy with OMA. I liked traveling around and visiting museums  and stuff, but I didn   t feel like that was really working. Anyway, to make a  long story short, I got an offer from the Historical Society and left. Now, I   ll  qualify and tell you that I really do think that I got OMA on track. It almost  died after I left. Fortunately, they then hired Carolyn Pool, and she   s the one  who really made that organization into a top-notch professional  organization.  22  Larson How long were you in that position?  Turner A little less than two years.  Larson Then you ended up going over to OHS. What was your role there?  Turner I was hired as director of museums and sites. I brought the same orientation  there that I had at OMA, which was problematic in some respects. That is  that I had visions, but I was not the kind of administrator needed for the day-to-  day tasks of the supervision and so forth. In that day and time, for  instance, I   d been director there for three months when I went out to the  Panhandle on some business and visited with what was then one of the  museums. They didn   t know that I   d been made director there. I was able to  address a lot of those kinds of concerns. I think that I gave them some good  planning documents. The Oklahoma Historical Society at that point had  been shaped by some early historical goals, which in some respect were  right for the time, but, for instance, the old motto of the collection policy of  the state museum, as opposed to all of them is    Bring it on in. If the future  doesn   t want it, the future can throw it away.    There was a lot of that kind of  mentality there.  There were dozens of museums that had been created without a clear  purpose because they were in a particular senator or representative   s district.  He wanted it, and they got it. I was able to address some of those things, and  I also tried to create a budget. There was some criminal behavior at the  Oklahoma Historical Society in those years. Some important collections  were diverted from   gifts that were intended to go to the Historical Society  that went to private collections. There were a lot of those kinds of issues.  There were problems of other kinds. You tell me later how much I need to  talk about this. I did not directly interface with those, but I think I was  perceived rightly as a threat to those interests. I was rightly connected with  the one who really was a threat to those interests, which was Glenn Jordan,  who was director at that time. Glenn, I think in some respects had some of  the same characteristics I do as an administrator, and that is that he needed a  lot of help to take care of the business and didn   t always get it, alienated his  board, and was eventually fired.  He had hired me, during which time I had made a couple of enemies,  including with the one who would become the director, who felt like I   d  taken the position that he should have gotten. I want to come back to two  things that to my mind, three   . One is I created what I thought was a  systematic means for evaluating the museums of the state. That   s one of the  few documents that I   ve written that I can   t find, and I know why I can   t  find it because when they began reorganizing the museums in the   80s,  Danney Goble borrowed that report from me and lost it. (Laughs)  Essentially, what I argued was that we needed to define that there were  23  certain institutions in the state of Oklahoma or certain places in the state of  Oklahoma that had to be preserved, the Sequoyah Cabin, the  George   Murrell mansion, a few things of that nature. Then we need to think in terms  of the history of the state, that we need to think that you have these themes  and these regions and so forth, and we need to have museums that  perpetuate that. In effect, we are creating a hierarchy. One of the results of  that was is that I  was accused of  cast ing  aspersions.  I didn   t really. I just said that it was a low priority on the Oklahoma  Publishing Museum here in Guthrie, which put me at odds with some very  potent folks. I called it a white elephant, and it has proven that for decades.  The Oklahoma Historical Society has spent more money on that particular  facility than any other, and probably had thirty visitors. That   s a little bit of a  hyperbole there, but it just was not a good investment in terms of the cost  that it would be to maintain it and the interest. People were not interested in  a publishing museum. It did not have that kind of absolute historical merit  that you said,    Well, you got to defend it whether they   re interested or not.     That kind of thing put me at odds with lots of some potent folks. The other  thing, I remember two things in which   . At board meetings I was  questioned about something. I recommended that we share the painting that  we had   . There was an international exhibit that wanted it for circulation,  and I recommended that we share it.  They said,    Is there risk?    I said,    Of course there   s risk. These are the  ultimate in professions. They   re going to do this.    Well, I was later told that  they just couldn   t understand why I   d recommended that and that I   d  presented it arrogantly. Maybe I had. The other thing was, though   this is  one that still tickles me. It gives you an idea of how important the work Bob  Blackburn did at the Oklahoma Historical Society because Bob   s the one  who really managed to get that organization professionalized throughout. I  presented a proposal that the museums inside the budgeting should be based  upon a projection of   . I   d gone back, and I   d looked at at our expenses in  certain categories for years. I said,    We need assume that this year we   ll  have an air conditioner that goes out and that we need to stop being  constantly worried about where that   s going to come from. We need to set  aside money for these kinds of categories within a budget.     Well, I literally got raked over the coals because they were accusing me of  wanting to go out and tear up air conditioners or something. Fortunately, or  unfortunately, I was contacted by a person at Elk City who wanted to build a  museum, an oil museum. The Anadarko basin was flourishing, and he had  money to burn and had commitments from two major sources of oil revenue  to build an oil museum. He asked me if I   d do it and said that they had a  million-dollar pledge, an endowment to get started planning, so I left the  Historical Society. We were living in Guthrie at the time. Wrote up a  proposal for a museum. Traveled to Midland-Odessa and did that and got  24  caught by the Penn Square. Then I ran a rural water district for a year and  then got hired at El Reno.  Larson For folks who don   t have the background on what happened with all of that,  can you talk a little bit about   .  Turner Yeah, Penn Square?  Larson Yeah, for future listeners.  Turner Well, my secretary at Oklahoma Museums Association, I   m still in touch  with her. The last year, while I was at the Historical Society, her boyfriend  told me he had this business idea of setting up a roustabout. I said,    Well,  don   t do that. It   s a bubble. It   s going to crash.    What had happened, of  course, is they   d found natural gas in deep-well drilling and pools that had  previously been untapped. There was a real boom in western Oklahoma,  which   . Let me talk about the problems there in a minute. In any case, the  boom, like many oil booms began, got a boom psychology. Rather than  making investments, people were betting on the come. What happened was  that Penn Square was passing loans on up clear to Chicago and making all  kinds of crazy loans, and it just crashed.  It was a bubble, and it crashed, as I   d told Larry  secretary   s boyfriend , but  not smart enough to follow my own advice and went to work for the people  who were going to pull out once it crashed. That was a disaster in western  Oklahoma. I suspect, if you look at   . As I said, you had that precipitous  decline from World War II to the present in terms of people moving off the  farms and consolidation and so forth. You look at the spike in that pattern; it  was after the oil boom. What happened is a lot of those guys got oil money  and went out and bought more land, and land values were being inflated.  They wound up with high debt and no way they were ever going to get it  back. A lot of farmers went bankrupt, richer than they   d ever been in their  life for a year, and then bankrupt.  Larson Well, this was coming into the beginnings of the farm crisis nationally,  anyway, even without the boom.  Turner Exactly. That   s interesting because to some extent, that   s kind of what  happens with a lot of the particular Oklahoma crises, including the Dust  Bowl. It   s part of a larger picture, as well. Then it specifically impacts in  Oklahoma.  Larson Now, just talking about some of these earlier positions that you had, you  know, once you had your dissertation, well, once you   d finished your grad  courses, what impact would you say those jobs earlier in your career had on  you and how you thought about things going forward?  25  Turner They were important in terms of an orientation to content and so forth. I did  a lot of research while I was in those positions, and the folk art interest is  one that I continued with and still have kind of connections there. It   s just  kind of become a part of my life. I think that they also, though, ultimately  represented the decision to finally grow up. I decided that there was ways to  be right and differ without leaving a good job (Laughs) or without having  another one. I was bound and determined to stay at the next job that I got  when I got one. I got hired at El Reno, and I did. Fortunately, I was able to  get out of it. (Laughs) I was able to get another job, but I didn   t just walk off  from it. I promised myself that I wasn   t going to do that anymore. This  sounds silly, but what that decision really meant as a person was that I was  willing to accept conflict. To this day, my basic strategy is if there   s a  conflict going on, I prefer to leave. I don   t want to mess with it. What I  would do at Altus or at the Historical Society and whatever else, if there was  a problem, I   d just leave and let them worry about it. I finally decided if I  had a problem, I was just going to have to deal with it, have to confront it,  and did so with some success.  Larson I was thinking, at some point, you know, if you just look at your CV without  knowing what you actually do and have done, when you went back to the  academic side of the house in 1982, it almost looks like there   s a shift, you  know, from working directly in public scholarship to going back to  academics. Did that signal a shift for you, or did you still see yourself  working in public forms of history?  Turner It definitely signaled a shift, and part of it was that I had realized that     when the oil museum fiasco hit, I had some opportunities to do some grant  writing. I just did not want to be under that pressure. Furthermore, there was  a kind of Al Turner integrity issue there. I didn   t want to write grants just to  write grants, you know, that kind of thing. I didn   t want to do that, and I  couldn   t find other museum work. By that time, I   d also realized that I had a  very particular set of skills that didn   t always fit a lot of needs and that even  if I found another museum job, I   d probably be bored in a week. There was  a lot of shifts there, but it did not mean the leaving of the public stuff. I  continued to speak and do grants and all that other kind of stuff. One of the  reasons I did was because by that time I had decided that it was important  and I valued it and I made a little bit. I also thought that that might be the  way by which I would get to another university. The writing was pushed  along for the same reasons, and partly because it was something to do. As  Don Green said,    Most of us who keep writing do so for our own sanity.     Larson Could you talk about the progression of your career then? You ended up in  El Reno at Redlands  Community College .  26  Turner At Redlands. There was kind of an almost interfamilial thing there, a  network. I met Duane Anderson, who at that time was the history teacher  who would soon become director of community service at El Reno Junior  College and on the Oklahoma Humanities Council board. We had an affinity  then. Still do. Duane and I are still friends. Duane kind of interceded for me  when he took the community services job. I interviewed with Ron Garner,  and Ron, of course, asked me about what happened at Altus. I told him, to a  great extent. I told him it was my problem, and I had grown up. He believed  me. I still appreciate that. Then Bill Cole said,    Fine,    too. Bill Cole and  Duane and, to a lesser extent, Ron and I became kind of friends. Then later  while we were there, Bill hired Harrel Kennedy. We became kind of a  quartet on a lot of stuff, did a lot of things together. I was faculty, and they  were administrators. Duane and I were friends. There wasn   t an  administrative barrier between us.  I wasn   t a buddy with Harrel until after that. I never became one with Cole.  Cole would be one of those other people that would be vitally important to  my life. Bill Cole was one of those people that if he   he   d kind of adopt  you, and once he did, he was going to take care of you. He took care of me  pretty good. I stayed at El Reno and eventually became chair there for the  social sciences umbrella. By the fifth or sixth year, I was already, (I spent  ten years there) I was really having problems. I can   t handle very much  repetition. I don   t even like to give the same talk more than once or twice. I  started teaching. I   d teach everything. I taught some humanities classes, and  I loved teaching sociology. Teaching sociology was part of my original  assignment there. It was a very important one because it was another of  those areas which I began to think a little wider again. I   d taken some  sociology work at Warrensburg  Missouri , consciously preparing myself  for the possibility of maybe needing to teach something other than history.  Teaching it was really, I liked what it did to the way I think about things. I  was really desperate and trying to find some way to teach things. I had  taught history every which way you could teach it. The writing and the  projects were a way to kind of take some of that pressure off, too. It allowed  me to keep from going brain-dead, as I thought of it. That   s a way a lot of  people   I know Bill Corbett definitely thought that. That   s another story.  Jim Fowler was my best friend out of graduate school, and he was at  Seminole Junior College. I don   t think Jim ever went brain-dead from the  repetition and so forth, but on the other hand, he kind of died as a scholar  there. One of the things that happened in Oklahoma higher education as a  result, I think, of the Odie factor and the OSU factor was that a lot of us did  wind up at junior colleges for a period of time and by and large were out of  pocket. Essentially, what they   ve done since that point is to hire people who  do not have that doctorate.  27  They backtrack to what position they were at before. It   s probably working  better for them in some respects, but I   m qualifying that a little bit. I think  actually there were a number of us who (myself, Bill Corbett, but also  Danney Goble) were originally junior college faculty who eventually broke  out of the junior college mold. I thought I could write my way out or project  my way out. I finally realized that in some respects I was threatening to the  model and decided that I was going to have to administer my way out. The  OSU connection was really what made that work. They had a dean   s  position at Northwestern  State University . Tim Zwink and I (he was the  VP there) had never been close, but we knew each other. I had good  recommendations, and I   d done some good work at El Reno and managed to  persuade them I could be a dean. That was the next step.  Larson You administered your way out. Now, at the time you were doing all this,  you folks had been living in Guthrie for a while. Were you commuting to El  Reno?  Turner The first year at El Reno, I commuted from Guthrie. That was also the year  that my dad died. I taught a night class one night a week, and I spent that  night in Oklahoma City with my mother. Then the next year, we moved to  El Reno. El Reno just about wiped us out financially because of the oil  boom again. We bought, in    81 or    82, a house at 11 percent interest. When  we sold that house, we had to come up with five thousand dollars cash after  never missing a payment for ten years. We had to come up with cash to get  out from under it. That put the Turner financial plan a few steps behind,  (Laughs) but we recovered some it in Alva.  Larson You went to Northwestern State, and that would have been    92?  Turner Ninety-one to ninety-six.  Larson What was your role there?  Turner I was a dean. In reality, at Northwestern I was both more of dean than I  would be at East Central and less. At Northwestern, I taught a minimum of  nine hours a semester, which meant that if you   re going to be conscientious  in your class responsibilities that you are not going to have a whole lot of  time for administration, certainly not a full-time administrative job. I also  did that and student-teacher supervision, which meant that   . By that point,  I was getting old enough that I was beginning to occasionally go to the  energy well and not find an abundant resource. (Laughs) I was exhausting  myself trying to do all that, but also I was still trying to avoid conflict. There  was some instances in which I should have drawn some lines there that I  didn   t. I think I was, at best, a mixed success as a dean there. I did some  things that got them their schedules a little more systematic and that sort of  stuff.  28  The president was not an academic by any stretch of the imagination. I think  if they would stay there from eight to five, (I mean that: eight to five) he  didn   t care what went on otherwise. Tim fought a battle against that and  with some degree of success. He was trying to get some attention to  academics and rigor and those kinds of things. There was a little bit of a  struggle there. Joe Struckle was, he was a mess. You   d tell him things like     he   d called me in one time about a faculty member and said,    I saw him  downtown at three o   clock in the afternoon. We can   t have him downtown  at three o   clock in the afternoon.    I said,    He was down making a speech to  the city.       Well, okay, but tell him not to, that he can   t   .    He worried  about that. That was his ultimate standard of   . Then you   d have people  teach night classes or drive to teaching classes at Enid. He just obsessed  about stuff like that. Anyway, he was a hard man to work for. (Laughs)  By that time, I   d decided that, and I was able to   even though I wasn   t  willing to confront my faculty as much, I   d occasionally stand up to  Struckle. I think I was in the process of adjusting to those things at Alva,  even with one real mistake I   d made in hiring and not being able to get off  of it. An opening came at Ada, which Duane Anderson was now vice  president at Ada. Bill Cole was president  as he had been  at El Reno. In  fact, the old boys    network had established there and became known as the  El Reno Mafia. (Laughter) That was Cole, Anderson, and Kennedy. Harrel  was the vice president for development at Ada. They decided by    96 that  they could handle one more El Reno product, maybe. They had an opening  for a dean. I originally went down to talk to Duane about being his associate  vice president and at that point was looking at, I was close to vested in  Oklahoma.  I was thinking about taking my  retirement  at Oklahoma and going to  Kansas or someplace like that and looking at presidencies and so forth. I  really decided that,    Wait a minute, Alvin. You   ve learned that you   re not  an administrator.    When Duane asked me to consider that, I told him, I said,     You know, this is  as  an assistant to you,    and Duane is, as I said, the most  talented administrator I   ve ever seen. I still don   t know how he gets all done  that he does without burning out. I said,    By definition, anything you need  help with is going to be taken care of, this detail or that detail. I   m not good  at details.    What he did was he hired the dean to do that job, and then me to  become the dean. That   s not quite the way it worked, but it   s essentially  what worked down. I think I was a very good dean at East Central. I didn   t  have to teach as much. My teaching load was reduced, so I was able to  concentrate on some administration.  Larson That   s a tough gig, trying to teach three courses a semester, at least, and  still be dean.  29  Turner Right. Struckle didn   t want to be accused of not getting work out of his  people. (Laughter) That   s the resources of the small colleges, too, and that   s  another whole story, the issues of what we expect out of regional  universities and junior college and those kind of things. I   ll speak to that at  some point if somebody ever wants me to. I think I was a good dean at East  Central because I was able to work with my faculty, and I had their respect,  and I gave them mine. We got most of what needed to be done. I hated  administration. I really did not like it.  Larson Yet, you did a lot of it over the years.  Turner The other side of that story, though, see, by this point, I   d also burned out in  the classroom. I burned out at El Reno. I didn   t realize it as much. I thought  I was burned out on the subject. Even when I was doing other kinds of  teaching, I just didn   t want to mess with students anymore. Students were  changing. As much as I want, I had promised myself and my family and  God and everything else that I would stay at El Reno. What really allowed  me to do that was an infusion of women in the   80s who were coming back  to higher education. They turned out to be the kind of students that  encouraged me to teach. In fact, when I think about, you know, college  faculty, like, to think about their legacy in terms of their students, I tend to  think of some of those women that came through El Reno junior college.  Larson What other changes have you seen across your career in terms of the  students coming in? Have you seen other either demographic changes or  changes in preparation?  Turner Oh, yeah, but it is not academic preparation as much as it is attitudinal.  Anybody who went through higher education in the past knows instances in  which people said, they threw down their book and said they were never  going to read another one and that was the first one they   d ever read. They  got through with their gentleman Cs and those kinds of things. I   m not  saying that it was all perfect in the past, but there was a respect for learning  and demands and rigor and those things that is just not there anymore in the  contemporary populace. They   re not going to do it. In fairness to them, it  may be that they are representative of one of those paradigm shifts in which  we reconfigure knowledge, in which we redefine knowledge. When books  came out, there were people who were worried that civilization was going to  hell in a handbasket because people weren   t memorizing sources anymore.  The kind of knowledge that we value may not be, but it is not valued. It may  not have a future, but it   s certainly not valued by our students. I think, as  well, speaking as a working-class kid who went to higher education, first  generation, my dad had not finished high school, and most of his family had  not. I think that   we saw education as an economic opportunity but also  something beyond. By and large, I did not see that in the first-generation  30  students I was encountering at Ada and at Alva. They saw it as an economic  ticket if anything, and that was   . I don   t think they thought about  themselves changing and the effects of education and so forth.  Larson Have you seen a difference in the orientation of what you have to teach in a  class? By that I mean as you were getting further on in your career, did you  find differences in student preparation where you   d end up having to teach  critical thinking more than you used to, or research or citations, you know,  or even writing?  Turner Oh, yeah, and plus defensiveness when you try to correct writing or  something. If you need me to address that further, I will, but I want to hit on  something else that that triggered. I think that it, again, in fairness to  contemporary audiences, we had a canon. We had a master narrative for  history. We had a coherent narrative. I know it, all of its flaws and all of  those kinds of thing. If you took a college history class, you could expect to  learn an umbrella of knowledge that covered a lot of bases and gave you a  critical understanding of the American past. If you took it one period, you   d  get one critical understanding, but you still had a comprehensive vision. You  could know what books to read in order to be considered among the literate  and the well-read. Today, it   s a crapshoot. There is no canon. There is, but  we won   t admit it, and the standards by which we measure knowledge are  not critical. They are topical. It   s an uncertain trumpet that   s being blown in  higher education.  I think faculties have changed, as well. Some of that is demographics.  Again, my generation and my peers that I talk to, we all had a sense of  mission, and I don   t sense that among contemporaries. I don   t. I   m  sympathetic to them, but I don   t sense that. Then they have that burden of  meetings and advisement and all those other kinds of things, plus the  expectation and the undervalue that they will be all those things. They   ve  got to do some classroom work and do some research, too, in order to stay at  the   . Somewhere or another, higher education as well as public education  fits that dictum   one of the few that I can remember that says every reform,  however necessary, will by weak minds be carried to an excess which will in  and of itself require additional reform. I think we   re there. I think I was  blessed to be a part of higher education when I was, both as a student and as  a member, but it   s not that anymore.  Larson Well, I think now might be a good time to switch to talking, moving from  talking about the actual positions you   ve held to some of the important  publications and projects you   ve been involved with. Do you want to start  that now, or do you want to wait until the next time or push ahead?  Turner I will be willing to push ahead. I   m fine. I   ll just drink another glass of  water.  31  Larson We shall carry on for a bit. There are a few that I   d like to ask you about in  terms of publications and projects, but these may be entirely different from  the ones that you feel are the most important. Once I   m done picking your  brain about the first group, we can turn it around and talk about the ones  that you think are really seminal to you. Because the exhibit at the OSU  Library, the Dust, Drought, and Dreams Gone Dry exhibit is in both of our  minds right now because of the talk you   re giving next week, your work  editing Caroline Henderson   s Letters from the Dust Bowl is kind of in the  forefront. Could you talk a bit about how you managed to get involved with  that project?  Turner That flowed from another project.  Larson They all do sooner or later.  Turner That one flowed from my annotation of these self-published  autobiographical accounts and so forth. I read Eli Jaffe   s Oklahoma Odyssey  in which he talked about spending time with Caroline Henderson and  mentioned that he had written to her for a while. I subsequently met Eli and  helped him place his papers in the Western History Collection at the  University of Oklahoma and secured his permission to use his letters. He  had some of hers, so I thought,    Oh, this is a little article here.    Then I  thought a little wider and thought,    Well, I wonder if there   s more letters out  there.    In fact, one of my old Altus, (he   s actually not Altus proper) Jackson  County connections, I was talking about it to him one time. He said,    I know  who that lady was. My mother wrote her.    She apparently had  correspondents all over the place. I found a little trove of letters and then  thought,    I wonder if family have them,    at which point I made my initial  contact with the daughter, or tried to make it and couldn   t get ahold of her  and gave up on that. Everyone said she   s kind of cranky, and she was. So  was Caroline. (Laughs)  I gave one more try, and then I contacted Eleanor   s (Caroline   s daughter)  son, who was an academic himself, thinking maybe we spoke a common  language. We did, and he said,    Call Mother. She talks by the phone.    I  called her, and she said,    Well, yeah. I   ve got a basement full of them.     (Laughs) She had every letter that Caroline had written her in her lifetime  and had them in boxes in the basement of her home in Amherstburg,  Ontario, where she had retired after a career in medicine. I flew to Detroit. I  had a friend up there, in fact, a friend that I   d met back in the museum days.  She had been the regional coordinator for the Michigan Museums  Association, which didn   t make it, and is now an artist. Dolores loaned me  her van. I went to Amherstburg and picked up the papers and brought them  through and flew them home. Carmelita and I sat in the garage and sorted  32  them because they needed to be fumigated and so forth. Carmelita got a  severe case of bronchitis, but we sorted them and then started at it.  Larson How long did that end up taking, the whole project from stem to stern,  would you say?  Turner You know, about four years.  Larson I actually would have thought it might have been longer because that was a  huge undertaking.  Turner Yeah, yeah. Well, it was one that occupied me for a good amount of time. I  enjoyed it. I started it at Alva, actually. The first steps of it were in Alva. We  picked up the letters after we moved to Ada. I   ve been delighted with that  book. It   s still in print, and that   s unusual for an academic book. (Laughs)  It   s been in print now for thirteen years, I guess, something like that, and it   s  still selling. It wouldn   t be in print if it weren   t still selling. That   s been one  of those defining projects. In some respects, I can   t let go of it. A couple of  years ago, I was really ready to. Again, this repetition business, I had  lectured about Caroline all over the state, and I was tired of talking about it.  Then I got kind of revitalized with the exhibit and with the Dust Bowl  presentation, the Ken Burns project, which I think you know that I had some  objections to that. I was involved in it because they incorporated a lot of the  material from Caroline, but I disagreed fundamentally with the guilt trip. I  just think it   s wrong.  Larson Let   s talk about that. Pull that out a little bit.  Turner I argued perhaps a little wider than I needed to in the article in the recent  Chronicles of Oklahoma, but the essential problem is that the position that  they took was a hardline declensionist narrative about how everything was  destroyed by greed and capitalism and all those kinds of things. I   m  speaking to my congregation Sunday. No, I spoke to my congregation last  Sunday, and I told them that we think that capitalism has been one of the  great boons to mankind. It is, but it   s also a destructive force. I   m not  worried about arguing with Dr.  Donald  Worster on that point, but there   s  more to the narrative than that, including the fact that there have been worse  dust bowls in prehistory before humans ever had contact with the region. I  think that the Burns narrative at best simplified a very complex  development. Perhaps more problematic, I think that it perpetuated a  misunderstanding of both the political process but also the process by which  we get anything solved, but also the understanding of the regional problem. I  think that we have to address the problem of drought, and now water table  depletion. The narrative that they follow tends to say that, I don   t think  they   re dealing with that. Anyway, that was a little bit of an argument there.  33  Larson Well, for as long as some of his documentaries have been on subjects that at  least on the face would seem to be considerably more shallow, it was very  short for a Ken Burns documentary at four hours.  Turner Yes, I think that   s it. Part of it was is that they didn   t want to deal with the  complexity of it. I said something while ago, that I   m sympathetic to a  documentary maker. Why? You need to tell a story, and if you do all of this     on the other hand    stuff, what you wind up with is incoherence. I think  that   s to some extent what   s happened to history. Nevertheless, I think that  you have a responsibility to your audience to say,    It   s not quite this  simple,    to at least pay attention to the Geoff Cunfer research and those  kinds of concerns.  Larson Back to the Caroline Henderson book, what was the most surprising thing  you discovered in the process of editing those letters?  Turner The most surprising thing was actually discovered after I had it published  and was talking about the book, and that is that one time it just dawned on  me that all of that I had grown up with, with the understanding of the Dust  Bowl and so forth talked about, its extremities, the hardships, the dust  clouds, those kinds of things. What I got to looking at from my own writing,  but nevertheless, what I got to looking at was not the peaks but the length,  the duration. Eighty storms like that a year as opposed to   . One giant  Norther is what people talk about, or one giant cloud, Black Sunday or  something like that, but eighty a year for years. You have a good year in  which there   s only forty, and some of those last three or four days. You  think,    How long does that go on?    The sheer wear and tear of that I think  was something that became more pressed upon me as I talked about the  book as opposed to putting it together.  Larson It   s interesting because we   ve talked a little bit about the interviews that  Jennifer  Paustenbaugh  and Steven Kite and Shelly Lemons did for the  Dust, Drought, and Dreams Gone Dry oral history project, the fact that  these people, when they were doing those interviews, were on the far side of  it. They were looking back in retrospect, but when you   re looking at the  Caroline Henderson letters, she   s in the middle of all of this. Besides the  timeline, of course, and knowing the outcome, what do you think some of the  inherent differences are with that?  Turner I think you capture a sense of the fear, that sense of   I mean, they don   t  know how it   s going to come out. In any narrative, from this point, you  know how it ends. They did not know how it was going to end. They had no  assurance that next year would not be worse, that they would be able to  survive. That is what comes out in that    up close and personal    kind of  history, which has a value of its own and a very important one.  34  Larson Do you think that Caroline Henderson ever really managed to get past that  year once the Dust Bowl was over?  Turner No, no, no. Every biographer suffers to some degree, I think, from  biographer   s disease, you know, which you fall in love with your subjects.  Caroline was a remarkable woman. You could see it in her writing. You  could see it in   she would even say things, that she missed the days of  forward-looking thoughts, that she had lost something fundamental in those  years. It was that sense of hope. That   s, in some respects, I think the worst  thing that can happen to a person. She definitely never completely reclaimed  that, and with some justification. She had learned that that land was not  going to be what she had hoped it to be.  Larson For you, what was your biggest takeaway from that project?  Turner You know, other than the kind of thing that I   ve been talking about, that  close view and so forth, I think that it affirmed what I   ve been saying here,  of the importance of that kind of a narrative, of not only   . I think those  kinds of narratives have two very important contributions to make. One of  them is as a part of the record of humanity. I think they also offer an  important corrective to the tendency of history to try and create theories that  correspond to some reality other than the one encountered with what Tom  Isern calls    boots on the ground.    When you look at those stories, then you  can explain it away if you want to, but at some point you   ve got to deal with  it. This is what these people thought. This is what they felt. Just one  illustration of that. I will guarantee you that you can find it in textbooks and  in college lectures to this day about the Jeffersonian vision was something  made up by a generation of historians and popularizers in the late nineteenth  century and so forth. Caroline Henderson believed in it. She wrote about it  expressly. That   s who she was. She was shaped by that. This is not  something that   s made up. It challenges this tendency of the academic mind  to explain things away in terms of some other brainwork and something.  Larson I think in some respects there   s a push towards, with research, there   s  always a push towards generalization     Turner Exactly.  Larson    and when you   re dealing with first-person accounts, you can see  sometimes the general and the specific. I guess this is a good jumping-off  point to talk a little bit about one of your more recent books on L. W. Marks  again. That   s another one of these histories that reflects some of its larger  context.  Turner I really appreciate your knowing that and pointing to it because I think that   s  what it contributes. In some respects, I wonder if it was a worthwhile  35  project. I did it because Whit asked me to. I do think that I tell a bigger story  there and one that   s significant to an understanding of Baptist work at the  time but also to a greater extent to church work at that time and the shaping  of Oklahoma. I think it meets those standards. I don   t know if that sold a  hundred copies. Well, it   s still in print because it   s print-on-demand now,  but it has not been especially well-received. It   s had a few good reviews.  Everybody who   s reviewed it has been positive toward it, except that we  didn   t include  many  footnotes, which was a decision that was arguable, but  most of the notes were from his diaries. Nobody has quarreled with the  interpretation or whatever else, but we had trouble giving away copies at the  Baptist Historical Society. (Laughs) Anyway, that   s another whole set of  stories.  Larson We   ll give you a chance to do a little teaser for it here. For those who  haven   t read it, I mean, what would you, what   s the importance of   .  Turner I think that it defines, tells you a number of stories. One is it talks about how  the ideas of progressivism shaped at least one minister   s career in a  denomination that is not usually associated with those values and so forth.  At the same time, his values and his orientations were very much a part of a  dynamic that is taking place in early Oklahoma among Baptists and among  others who are building institutions. I think that  was a  sense of  participation in something and a chance to do it and do it right, I think that   s  an interesting story. I think it   s an important part of the sense of what  Oklahoma is. I don   t develop that as much in that book, but I subsequently  have spoken on    the church comes to Oklahoma.    One of the things that I  learned in that is a different take on the way we think of our past is that  Oklahoma was not that heavily churched in its earliest years.  The churching takes place in the early twentieth century with, by and large,  Baptist and Methodist revivals and building of institutions that changed the  character of a lot of people who came in who may have had those  orientations to start with. It also led to that larger interpretive thing that I  apply to Oklahoma, the importance of settlement in terms of shaping the  state. Baptists and Methodists were able to respond to rapid change of  population because they don   t have to have all this institutional   . Bishop,  in the case of Methodists, says,    You guys go here.    The Baptists say,     John, come out of the corn patch and preach to us.    What you had was a  capacity to respond, whereas the ones who looked like they should have  taken over would have been the Presbyterians. They had more institutions  and more, you know, qualified ministers and so forth, but they could not put  people in the field as quickly. Episcopalians ran into the problem, as well.  Even Catholics to some extent couldn   t keep up with it.  36  Larson That   s interesting. As you were parsing through that, what was the most  exciting thing you learned with that? I mean, what did you uncover that you  hadn   t really thought about before?  Turner Well, I think that maybe it   s something I   ve thought about before, but I got  affirmed. One of the reasons that book has not been particularly well-received  in Baptist circles is I used a term that had a meaning that is  controversial. That   s    progressive,    and it meant one thing when Marks was  doing it. It means something else today. I addressed that, but the words don   t  matter. The title sticks out. That   s another way of saying that the issues that  Marks faced as a Baptist are those that I would ultimately face to some  extent as a person, as a Baptist. By the time I wrote that, I was a  Presbyterian, so I may have reflected some of that into that. I also  coauthored that history of the First Baptist Church with Bob Blackburn and  early on realized that through subsequent, fairly close association with  Herschel Hobbs that the Southern Baptist movement as I knew it was always  held together by a very fragile bond. There was always a tension between  the progressive element and the other whatever, however you define that.  Marks represented it to a certain extent. In a different way, Herschel Hobbs  did.  Larson Well, you   re not just an expert in prose but also poetry. I understand you  have a number of poetry works, number of poems and poetry work out there.  The one I think is most interesting because of its historic ties is    Hanging   Men .    How did that come about?  Turner It actually came about from some of the earlier poetry efforts and two  streams coming together. I   d always played with poetry when I was in  school. I wrote a lot of, I wrote sonnets and memorized sonnets thinking I  might be able to get a date. That   s high school days. I wrote a lot for  Carmelita in the early years, and she didn   t particularly care for poetry. I   d  always played around with it and done some doggerel occasionally. I did an  oral history project at Altus in the   80s, Southwest oral history project, in  which I interviewed, I don   t remember how many people, twenty maybe. I  thought about writing up articles, and I finally decided that I could tell some  of those stories better in verse. I compiled that into that first little chapbook I  put together. I don   t remember the name of it right now.     Waiting for  Rain     One of the stories I grew up with was the story of the Ada hanging.  My grandmother, who was one of the dominant influences in my life,  maternal grandmother, and her family lived in Ada at the time of the  hanging.  According to the family story, my uncle Alvin, for whom I   m named,  discovered the hanging. There   s a lot of evidence that supports that. You  know, everybody   s got their own story. I   ve never found the smoking gun  that says that, but there   s a lot of internal evidence that goes with that. I  37  grew up with the story and felt a kind of ownership for it. That   s not the  kind of thing that academics write about. That   s more popular, and I don   t  have those kinds of skills or that inclination, either. Although, I had done a  number of lectures on it for academic groups. Again, it just didn   t lend itself  to kind of   but I thought finally one time that,    Wait a minute. I could do  that in a poet narrative.    I read the poems of Robert Cooperman, who  created this character and tells stories with poetry. Then I got to thinking  about Spoon River Anthology and those kinds of things. That   s what I tried,  which enabled me to tell the story.  Larson One of the things I was thinking of, you know, in poetry, I think we   re often  trying to connect a little more on an emotional level than we are when we   re  writing history. How did that complicate the process for you, or did it  uncomplicate the process?  Turner That story, one way or another, was going to complicate itself because it  asks some real questions about justice, about executions, about long-term,  you know, the consequences of historical action and so forth. You ask every  other one,    What did I learn?    The story that came out of that that still  occasionally bothers me to think about is (and it   s reflected in one of the  poems) on one of the anniversaries of the hanging, (I think it   s 2009)  Herman Kirkwood, who pulled that together, asked me to come and do a  prayer for the   acknowledgment of the hundredth anniversary of it, and I  did. Subsequently, went out to eat with some of the other people who  showed up for it, among whom was a descendent of Joe Allen, one of the  men who was hung.  He would have been a grandson or great-grandson of Joe Allen and got very  emotional talking about how much that gathering had meant to him because  he   d heard people like Herman and myself talk about the arguments against  that and the fact that these men were not necessarily subject to hanging and  those kind of things, and how much it meant for him to have heard that but  how much he wished his father could have heard it, who had lived with the  stigma of that without knowing anything that much about it, not knowing  that there was another side to the story, or maybe not having any  confirmation of that, and how much that had rolled through a family for  three or four generations.  Larson Why don   t we stop here for today, if that   s okay     Turner That   s fine.  Larson    and then we can pick up later on.  Turner All right.  38  Larson Thank you again for doing this.  ------- End of October 21, 2014 interview -------  Larson Today is December 3, 2015, and my name is Mary Larson. I   m very happy  to be back here with Dr. Alvin Turner. Once again, we   re at the Territorial  Museum in Guthrie for this interview, and this is the second part of our  interview. One of the things we had left over from the last time, I was  wondering if you could talk a little bit about the Oklahoma Memoirs project.  Turner That project actually started when I took a detour in my career, one of them  pretty profitable professionally into the museum field, and that time I was  living here in Guthrie. I read a book by Orrin Burright. I can   t remember the  title of it right now  The Sun Rides High , but I was kind of intrigued with it  from the standpoint of realizing that there was a layer of detail and story that  was not part of the narrative of history that I knew for the Oklahoma past. I  just got interested. I started looking for others like that, and I wrote an article  after I   d read about sixty books of that. Wrote it for the Chronicles, and then  just followed it out over the years, ultimately getting over three hundred.  I   ve gotten close to that number that   s ready for that database that we   ve  been working on, and there   s another dozen or so that I keep thinking I   ll  run across. In fact, I found one of them today. It   s been a good project. I  think there   s going to be some things of value for people, a lot of good  stories, and I hope I flagged those for people.  For my own thinking, I really think, (this ultimately connects to another  topic that I   d flagged) I really think that I kind of got an understanding of  past as opposed to just what I saw with the Burright material, the detail, that  sort of stuff. I think the collective there gave me that kind of view that you  associate with the analysts who look at, you know, look at the flow of  history over generations and at a particular place and time. That concept  fascinates me in their writing, but it   s also one of the seminal ones in Walter  Prescott Webb   s writing, who   s a great influence on my thinking. It   s kind  of all come together around that, and I   m not sure I can define what it is. I  think it   s just kind of like a deep knowledge that the farmer has of his land.  He knows where the water will run and where it won   t run, and if he   s got a  cut, what   s the acre that he cuts out of it, and that sort of stuff.  Larson Where have you been in your search for sources, or, actually, where haven   t  you been? (Laughter)  Turner I   ve probably found half of them   . In the early years, what I   d do, we   ve  always kind of traveled around on one little project or another, and anytime I  was at a local library, I   d stop there and see what they had from their local  people. Local museums often have them. After the internet, of course,  there   s been a   . Although, again, they   re hard to define what it is you   re  39  looking for on a net search. I   ve just kind of compiled them. There   s a nice  collection of them at the Oklahoma Department of Libraries, the Oklahoma  collection. Of course, I probably put fifty of those in there. Anyway, I just  kind of piled them up as time went along, and whenever I found them, I   d  either sit down and read them or get myself a copy and take notes on them  and so forth. Although, if I were a systematic person, I could have done a lot  more because I   d read the things and take a couple of notes and then not pay  attention to them. Then whenever it came time to finally come to focusing  on the project, I had to go back and look at them a lot, especially for some of  the details you try to cite and so forth.  Larson How much do you think you want to continue to expand that?  Turner Probably not much. I think that I   ve pretty well gutted the genre. I would  like to see what might come out of a new generation, though, because most  of these were written by people who would be my mother   s, my  grandparents    age, and I   d like to see what my age people   . I   ve read some  of those, but I   d really like to see what   s going to be written by the next  generation, those people who come out of the Oklahoma experience and the  countercultural movement. I don   t know that it will occur because this may  very well be a statement that is characteristic of a generation and of a place  in time rather than something that   . I compared them in my thinking to  English working-class memoirs. I don   t even know if this is a word, but  they   re coming out of an aspirational culture and expectations. I don   t see  quite that same thing operating in emerging people today, coming out of the  working class.  Larson Do you think that the change you mentioned, the generational change and  the counterculture, do you think it might be a change to doing collective  statements and collective histories rather than individual ones?  Turner You know, it could. It might. Something else I   ve been thinking about on a  totally different plane, I think that there is a sense in which the   on the one  hand, in contemporary society we have this hyper-individualism as reflected  in the rights movement and defining theology and whatever else, but we  also, there   s a sense in which the past had of,    My life has meaning. I have  meaning.    I   m not sure that that   s as present, and, in fact, what I read about  contemporary people, I   m suggesting that they don   t think that about  themselves. You even see that in declining political participation.  Larson That   s interesting. I   ve been parsing something like that recently, too, so  I   . One of the other organizations   I was going to say projects, but it   s  actually an organization. You   ve been involved with so many of them over  the years, but the Oklahoma Humanities Council is one that you   ve been  very close to. Do you want to talk about how you first fell in with them and  how you   .  40  Turner You know, I actually interviewed for the assistant director   s job just before I  was hired to teach down at Altus at the junior college there, and they hired  Anita May, who became the director. I had that connection, but in  interviewing with Jim Vore, who was the director at that time and who went  on to work with NEH, I realized that in looking back on it, I didn   t know  what he was talking about. That was clarified when I got down to Altus.  Jane Oden, who was with the Shortgrass Arts and Humanities Council there,  tremendous lady, Tal   s wife, Jane asked me if I would be the scholarly  humanist on a program, and I said,    I   m not a humanist.    I saw that as an  anti-Christian position, and she clarified that they wanted somebody in the  humanities. I said,    Oh, okay.    That led to involvement in a number of  programs through the Shortgrass Arts and Humanities Council, at which  time the programs all had to be geared to a theme which was citizen values  and community decisions.  You would look at an issue, and then you   d bring the perspective of a  historian or some other academic in the humanities to that issue. I did a  number of those through Shortgrass and radiated out to other library-related  programs, and then the humanities changed to any humanities-based  program, which led to a lot of museum and other library projects. We would  look at, oh, the ones I think of that popped into my head, when I was  director of the Oklahoma Museums Association, we did a centennial exhibit  for Will Rogers    birthday and took a trailer-load of his artifacts and an  exhibit in the back of a semi-trailer and hauled around by a truck. Took it all  over the state of Oklahoma, and then we did another one on folk art in  Oklahoma. We did a lot of different programs. We did exhibits for the  Museum of the Western Prairie, for the  Plains Indians and Pioneer   Museum at Woodward. Many of those had humanities grants behind them.  Larson You received an award from the Oklahoma Humanities Council.  Turner Yes, I did, . The number of award to mine was the humanities award. A  couple of those projects got AASLH  American Association for State and  Local History  awards, too.  Larson Well, we had a few topics that we didn   t manage to cover last time, that you  wanted to discuss this time around.  Turner Let me come back to the Oklahoma Museums Association. I don   t know if I  talked about that in the last time. The big projects I developed was in a two-year  stint I was with the Oklahoma Museums Association. By that time, I  understood how that grant processes could work. We were able to do those.  The other thing that was important about that was it really represented a  kind of salvation of the Oklahoma Museums Association. When I came on  as director, they said,    We want you to come on, but we don   t think we   re  41  going to be able to pay you after three to six months.    I told them I thought I  could, in effect, subsidize through grant development and so forth. That   s  what we were able to do. At the same time, I realized that that was what I  had done and that was about all I could get done. I did not have the kinds of  skills or focus that would allow me to really take that organization to the  next level. I left in a really disastrous move, but I left anyway. Then a guy  came on, and he wasn   t able to do it. Then Carolyn Pool came on, and she  really built that organization to a first-class professional association and  museum association. It   s one of the best in the country.  Larson Well, you wanted to talk about Oklahoma outlaws, which I can   t wait to see  where this goes because it   s a great topic.  Turner I   ve approached this from a number of standpoints, and Hanging Men  addressed that. I think what really made me realize how off it was was a  comment by Dick Lowitt when I did a program on it for a group that he was  a part of. He said that he almost didn   t come because he didn   t like outlaws  but that he understood that I was doing something different. I had known  that, but I don   t think it was as strong in my mind. That was a few years ago,  and it   s gotten even more concentrated since then that outlawry is not an  academic subject, you know, that this is cops and robbers. Academics, by  and large, stay away from it. There   s a couple of big exceptions, notably  Richard Maxwell Brown, who   s one of my heroes, but by and large, this is  kind of popular history as opposed to academic history. There   s some good  reasons for that because you don   t have the reliable sources for this history  that you would have of others, and yet, I think that it represents a bit of  flawed thinking.  For instance, in the case of Oklahoma, it tells us some very important things  about our past, and one of the reasons it does is because in Oklahoma the  outlawry period and the period of contingent violence and so forth was  much longer and much more concentrated at times, whereas, let   s say  Montana or New Mexico or wherever else you have, there   s stories. The  Earps in Tombstone, you have a period there, and then it   s over with. It   s a  ten-, fifteen-year period, something like that. In Oklahoma, it is a fifty-year  period, and I think that has to have had an effect upon the state. I can   t help  but connect that to everything from the Creek orphan scandal to   . Well,  bootlegging, for instance, into the modern era, was a principal shaper of  local politics in Oklahoma. If we stay away from those topics, we   re really  not dealing with the character of the people and to some extent of its  institutions.  Larson It   s interesting because what you said just now about the length reminded  me of something you had said about what you realized in dealing with the  Caroline Henderson papers and just the sheer enormity and length of the  42  Dust Bowl era and how if you just hear about a couple of episodes you don   t  realize the full impact, and in the same way   .  Turner That may be a perspective, too, that comes out of those memoirs is realizing  that I haven   t gone back to them. I keep thinking I   ll do is go back through  the whole database and look for every reference to bootlegging, but it   s  prominent. There   s a sense in which I would argue that if the memoirs  represent a fair sample, that you go back through there and you   re going to  say bootlegging is a part of who Oklahomans were. It   s connected in every  person   s experience in the, let   s say, before the 1950s and up to the Second  World War. That then also links to such things as understanding the nature  of the state as a    pore    state. I said    pore    intentionally, not poor, because  we have been historically economically disadvantaged. It reflects in all sorts  of ways.  Larson You were talking about just now the study of outlawry as more popular  history versus academic history, and one of the things I think that   s changed  over the years is how public history has been accepted as academic history.  One of the things you wanted to touch on was the emphasis on or the  evolution maybe of public history in Oklahoma.  Turner I think what I really had in mind more than anything else was, (and I caught  that in that first interview as I mentioned Sally   s labeling me that way and I  had never thought of myself that way) I think that that has been probably  OSU   s unique niche. I think that you look at those of us who came through  that program in the   70s. Many of us have gone into aspects of public  history from Paul Lambert and Kenny Franks and Bob Blackburn and  myself and others, Glen Robertson. A lot of us did, as well as one foot in  higher education, but it   s continued. Jim Smallwood did a lot of work in that  area, and Bill Bryans has continued to do so.  I think that you also look at people like Mary Jane Ward, and Patty Laughlin  has moved over into it, as well. I think that that has been   and one of the  areas of historical work that I   ve never really done much on but that has  nevertheless pulled a lot of people into that public history realm has been  preservation efforts and so forth. There again, but I think that that has been a  uniquely OSU historical departmental, if you look at the people who have  done that over the last forty years, it   s been OSU people, by and large.  There   s exceptions to that, of course. I   m cheating here. I   m looking at  notes. I wanted to say one more thing about outlawry.  Larson Oh, sorry. Didn   t mean to get you off there.  Turner You didn   t. I just neglected to say it when we got to it. I said to an audience  one time   I was always trying to win what I thought of as the Danney  Goble award. Danney one time said something, a comment, about people in  43  southeastern Oklahoma would be happy if they got home with their Nehi  cola and a Moon Pie. I had this mythical award in my mind. I   d say these  things not really with that intention but with the hope that it would get me  that kind of attention because he got called out in the state legislature. I  remember speaking to a group of people in Watonga one time and saying  that the odds are if your family is rooted in this area and prosperous, it built  it on exploiting Indians.  I did offend some people, but I also had some people gave me one of those  knowing looks. The prominence of Native Americans in our culture and the  prominence of mining the Indians as Terry Wilson   s book on the Osages, I  think, talks about it as a part of our institutions from Robert Owen   s and  Angie Debo   s book. Also it became locally incorporated. It became almost  institutionalized, and I think that that, again, is a very important part of our  culture that is connected to this outlawry theme but also to Oklahoma  uniqueness, Oklahoma exceptionalism, maybe. (Laughs)  Larson Do you think that all ties in the general sense of scoundrelry, I guess, if  that   s a word, ties into the number of governors we   ve had impeached over  the years? (Laughs)  Turner Yeah, yeah, I think that it   s part of the turbulence. I do. The problem of local  history is the reverse of that national   . I   ll talk about it in a minute. The  problem of local history is if you   re not careful, you assume that this is  Oklahoman. You talk about gubernatorial scandals. Well, my all-time  favorite political commercial was one that came out of, I think it was out of  the late   70s or   80s, but it was the guy running against Duke, Edwards  against Duke in Louisiana.    Vote for the crook. It   s important.    I mean, you  know, you   ve got these kinds of scandals in every state, and yet there may  be a qualitative difference in Oklahoma. Some of that   s newness. Our  institutions are still comparatively newer than others.  Larson That   s true, too. This seems like a good time to touch on a topic that we  actually hit a little bit in the first interview, that we were going to come back  to in more depth, and that   s about your thoughts on local and regional  history and how that can serve to inform the larger narratives.  Turner I think the point that I   ve built my case around, its name is legion. That is  the cause of the Civil War. However you look at the Civil War, the causes of  the Civil War can be understood as what leads to the beginning of conflict.  Well, there   s not much argument about that. This is the trigger point that  we   re looking at. If we look at acts of war, there are acts of war occurring  from Confederate states to American territory. Even if you discount the  appropriation of federal property in these southern states that are seceding,  Texas makes an act of war against American territory. Maybe that   s because  in the metanarrative we don   t talk about that too much. In the metanarrative,  44  they see the Western question as not that important, but that   s not the way it  was understood at the time. It   s certainly not the way it was understood in  Texas.  Texas saw that as a very important   and, in fact, Indian territory was  perceived as having a strategic role in the war effort, one that did not get  fulfilled nevertheless, but that   s not talked about in the larger narrative. You  start looking at what happened in the Civil War from an Oklahoma  perspective, and all at once you start seeing a whole bunch of different  things. The same thing is true if you   I think that, for instance, the comment  that I made about outlawry and its characteristic as being relatively brief as  opposed to sustained is a perspective that we might very well be able to look  at a lot of bigger questions in terms of. I   ve even seen it in   I   m not going  to pull the book on it, but one of the more influential books that I   ve read in  theology in the last year or two is by a Catholic theologian who   s talking  about the communities from whom the different biblical traditions emerged.   The Churches the Apostles Left Behind by Raymond E. Brown   What that author argues, I think very persuasively, is that you really  understand that John is writing for a particular group of people who are  isolated. You know, this is not a national movement. This is a movement  that   s taking place in this. There   s some interconnected to them, but it   s  going to have a local flavor. One of the ways in which I saw this most  sharply defined was back on doing work on  David Pendleton  Oakerhater. I  read some sort of supportive material talking about,    Here was the federal  policy.    Well, I understood what the federal policy was, but I looked at what  was happening as something entirely different. That   s true now. We know  that it   s one thing to pass a law and it   s something else to get it  implemented, even in an individual institution. It   s one thing for a president  to say,    This is what we   re going to do,    and to get everybody on the same  page.  Yet there   s a tendency for us to assume that when we change this law that  we change the effect of this agency or this institution upon people out here  in the hinterlands, and there   s going to be countless occasions in which they  don   t even get the message or in which they say,    We   re not going to do it.     That case in point was some of the policies vis-  -vis day schools on the  Cheyenne reservation. The local superintendent was opposed. It didn   t  matter what was being said where. He was opposed, and he was opposed  because he was opposed to the particular people involved in this one day  school and his own perception. That was what keyed it, and that kind of  perspective to the way things happened. If we look at history as an  understanding of the way things work as opposed to this other grander  scheme, I think then it has an awful lot to contribute.  Larson The real and the ideal.  45  Turner Right.  Larson Getting back to talking about OSU   s History Department and the emphasis  on public history, you also wanted to talk a little more about some of the  influences on your work. I don   t think we   some of those were OSU, and  some of those were from elsewhere. I   m not sure we got all of those covered.  Turner Going back and reflecting on the interview, I felt like I didn   t do Norbert  Mahnken a fair enough job. Norbert was easily one of three or four people  that I heard that I always thought if I could do a lecture that good, I   d die  happy. I mean, he was just a superbly gifted presenter and organizer of  material, and that   s a key concept because I think what he taught me more  than anything else was to try and get it organized, that the information  coherent but also complex. You know, it was never this simple narrative. He  always had the economic. He always had a story to go with it. It was a really  rich narrative is what I would say, and the economic dimension was the one  that was his most   he was an economic historian and the one that I  consciously sought to bring out in my stuff.  The other thing that I didn   t mention is that I was greatly influenced (I  alluded to him a while ago) by the great Walter Prescott Webb   s material  but not just the obvious. The Great Plains would be the obvious and the  perspective of the changing cultural influence of the plains, and I probably  wouldn   t, I   m not a hundred percent Webbian or a hundred percent  anything. I also loved his Great Frontier and that recognition of the  connectedness of   . Here again, if you think about it, of what   s happening  over here and the discovery of the new world and the implications of that for  everything from the rise of England to the changing theology. That kind of  perception of the past was, I think, really opened up to me through Walter  Prescott Webb.  Then I did a tremendous amount of reading in   I don   t know if I told this or  not. If it sounds familiar, cut me off. When I came to comps time, I went to  Dr. Mahnken and asked him for advice, and he said,    I   m going to tell you  what to do. I want you to go to the library, and I want you to walk up and  down those shelves like you do. I want you to pull down every book you  recognize, and you   ve got to promise me all you   re going to do is you   re  going to write it down, author, title, and thesis. Then don   t look at it  anymore.    (Laughter) What I was doing is building a bibliography. He  realized that I   d read very widely and extensively but that I tend not to  associate back to where I got an idea and so forth.  The point that I started to make on this is that I read a lot of anthropology in  conjunction with something else I was studying not too long ago. I realized  that I pulled up one of those guys, and I said,    Oh, this is one of them.    It  46  was Edwin Hall, the anthropologist. That   s a large part of this is the mind   .  My peers were always telling me,    You need to focus, Alvin,    and it  probably might have had a, got more things done if I had have. Somehow or  another, realizing that mysteries were about epistemology was important to  me and I think in some ways reflected in whatever I   ve done professionally  but also what I   ve become as a person. I wouldn   t trade it.  Larson You had wanted to address, a little bit, emerging women historians in  Oklahoma, and I didn   t know if that was more about changing roles in the  field or where they were coming out of programmatically or   .  Turner Until ten years ago, when I went to what was left of the Oklahoma  Association of Professional Historians, I was one of the young people. That  may be stretching it a little bit, but certainly fifteen years ago. I really  wondered who was going to come along, and then I began to be aware that  the ones who were coming along, by and large, were all female. I mentioned  the three of them in the other, Patty Laughlin and Linda Reese  and Mary  Jane Warde . Of course, Linda   s not that much younger than I am, but she   s  kind of emerged professionally in that period of time. After them, I don   t  know who   s coming along. That   s one of the things I   m a little concerned  about. I think that I   ve become aware in the pursuit of some personal  interests that Oklahoma and Texas, the two states that I   m most familiar  with, their local historical efforts have very strong local historical programs  and very strongly, very highly-developed state history. That   s not true in  Colorado, for instance. I knew that it wasn   t quite as true in Kansas, despite   Jim  Hoy and some of those.  I really wonder if maybe what we haven   t seen, really clear back with the  beginning of the Oklahoma Historical Society almost a hundred years ago  and continuing up to the present, is a window and, again, something else that  might be understood locally and not nationally as far as a development. I   m  more impressionistic than I am particular, but I   ve had a couple of senior  historians. Marvin Kroeker, in fact, is the one who said something about it to  me is that he felt like that there   s been a general decline in the scope and  quality of historical writing in Oklahoma the last twenty years. I don   t know  if that   s valid or not. It   s just kind of something that   s niggling at the back of  my mind. The ones that I mentioned are exceptions to it. If you look at  what   s showing up in the chronicles now, the people from the regional  universities are not writing for the Chronicles. Maybe not. I   m not sure what  they   re writing for.  Larson Do you think that may be a change in format with the internet and with  blogs     Turner Yes, I do. I think the net has definitely     47  Larson    other ways of getting things out?  Turner    yes, it definitely has had that effect.  Larson It does speak to questions of peer review, then. If people are blogging, (and,  I mean, there   s obviously feedback on those things) it   s crowd-reviewed.  Maybe it   s a different kind of peer review.  Turner The scary part of that, though, is that in so many areas of history now the  review is crowd-reviewed but it   s based on opinion and not critical  standards. I think that   s particularly true in some of the American  exceptionalism arguments that are going on presently.  Larson Whoever yells the loudest...  Turner Yeah, exactly.  Larson    they seem to win. That actually comes back to something else that we were  talking about earlier, about trends in higher education overall. You had  mentioned before, the problems posed by faculty having a whole lot of  multiple, competing responsibilities and the loss of the canon or a canon.  Were there other things you wanted to touch on along those lines?  Turner I think of myself as a product of higher education. I   ve even given a talk. I  don   t remember which one it is, but it says something to the effect that   in  defense of the humanities. I recall a definition of the humanities that was  given to me in a philosophy class at Central State College that said  humanities is asking the question,    Who am I? What is my relationship to  my fellow man? What is my relationship to my god?    I think I   ve answered  those questions for myself in what I   ve studied and through my studies, and  I think that that has enabled me to offer a great deal to different audiences.  That   s a kind of pretentious word, but if I   ve got a legacy of such, it   s  probably going to be more what I   ve said than what I   ve written because  I   ve said a lot more than I   ve written. (Laughs) On the other hand, by  definition, there   s a lot that I   ve said that I wish I could have taken back,  (Laughter) and maybe a few things that I   ve written.  In any case, I think that all those public humanities programs, I think that I  was reflecting that kind of perspective and so forth. I think that   s valuable,  and in light of what I was just alluding to, the dialogue that   s going on in our  culture now, it may be a product of the kind of specialization that says that  we don   t have any responsibility to a public other than to ourselves. I wrote  a piece (kind of got off my theme on my usual area) for Davis    last book on  Howard Zinn in which I argued about   . I said that we   ve got a prophet  here, but what do we have left when we   re through with this? We   ve got an  argument. We   ve got a basis for grievances, and they   re there. He doesn   t  48  manage to get to half of them, but where does that leave us? Is there a  possibility? I think that there is a possibility to also recognize that there are  things that unify us, and I don   t see that happening in my discipline now. I  don   t see any pus
