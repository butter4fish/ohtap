Speaker 2: Well, I guess my favorite phrase, is a phrase that I've lived by and I guess that's Thoreau [Henry David Thoreau] saying, and I feel a little strange this being my favorite saying because I think it's time to get in step sometimes, but it is, as you know, "If a man gets--is out of step with his companions, perhaps it is because he hears a different drummer.  Let him step to the music that he hears, no matter how measured or far away."

Story_ID: 612002
Speaker 1: Let's begin by talking about your family, and I'd like to begin with your mother's side of the family.  Would you state her name, spell it for me, please?  Tell me when and where she was born.
Speaker 2: My mother's name was Marion Majestic Daniels [Marion Daniels Earles] and she was born in New Orleans, Louisiana, in 1911 I think, yeah, 1911.
Speaker 1: Can you spell Marion for me so we have the--
Speaker 2: M-A-R-I-O-N.  Which I must confess to you that was my middle name originally and let you in on the secret, you see, I practice medicine, when I practice with my brother [Lucius Earles, III], people would come in and they would say, "Oh, I was expecting the doctor's mother."  "Oh, I was expecting the doctor's sister."  "Oh, I was expecting the doctor's wife."  I said, oh, my god, this gotta stop, so I changed my Marion, I changed it to Martin [HistoryMaker Dr. Rene Martin Earles]; I just changed the I to T, which is very difficult 'cause my mother's first name, and, but I told her, my mother is one of the most remarkable people I ever met and she understood, and she said, "I understand, honey."
Speaker 1: Why didn't you use your first name, Rene?
Speaker 2: Oh, Rene?  It's, I did, (laughter) you see, Rene is very equivocal to it, was, at the time, so Rene, is, it's a heterosexual name [sic.], bi- not bi, but it goes either way.  And I think, in this culture, most of the women, I mean, most of the people who had the name at that time were women, so that didn't get me off the hook.
Story_ID: 612003
Speaker 1: Tell me more about your mother [Marion Daniels Earles], did she share any stories about growing up--her growing up?
Speaker 2: Actually, not very much, my mother was the oldest of four girls and no, she did not share very much of her, her childhood, except that, she was--her father [Hubbard Daniels] was a minister, and that she did play in his church.  She played the organ, she played the piano, and she was in charge of her sisters.
Speaker 1: How many sisters did she have?
Speaker 2: My mother had three sisters, all of whom had--were musically talented, my aunt, I had one aunt who played the violin, and one who sang, and ano- one who did something else.
Speaker 1: You talked about your grandfather being a minister, did you know your grandparents?
Speaker 2: No, I didn't, I didn't know my grandfather, I think he died about the time I was born, but my mother's mother, surely I knew her.  She was a rather stern kind of woman, I never saw her smile, very dignified, and rather--when I say distant, I don't remember having too much communication with her.  Now in this house in New Orleans [Louisiana], as, as was the custom back then as it is in many countries, so extended family, my, my grandmother's mother, was there also.
Speaker 1: So your grandmother's name was Shirley, you said?
Speaker 2: No, my grandmother's name was Lottye, Lottye Daniels [Lottye Grooms Daniels] was her name.
Speaker 1: And what was your great-grandmother's name?
Speaker 2: He name was--her last name was Grooms, and maybe I can think of her name--Belinda, Belinda Grooms, who was--and she was born in slavery, and as--I think as a teenager, she was--I think maybe when--she was a teenager when the Emancipation Proclamation came about.  And the house in New Orleans that we were brought up in was a house that she and her husband built, and she was a cook for some, some people in New Orleans after slavery.
Speaker 1: Do you remember her husband's name that would be your great-grandfather?
Speaker 2: No, I don't.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Might have been a Fred [Frederick Grooms] though.
Speaker 1: I'm sorry?
Speaker 2: Might have been Fred, yeah, might have been.
Story_ID: 612004
Speaker 1: Tell me more about your mother [Marion Daniels Earles], the type of person she was.  Tell me about her education, how much education did your mother have?
Speaker 2: Well, my mother was--my mother is a college graduate.  My mother went to school in New Orleans [Louisiana] as did her sister [Eunice Daniels], they went to Dillard [Dillard University], and at the time it wasn't Dillard--it was Dillard University came about as a blending of something called New Orleans University and Straight College.  And my grandmother, my mother's mother [Lottye Grooms Daniels], was a graduate of New Orleans University, and she was a school teacher, and she taught my mother.  And so my mother, as a matter of fact, was a member of that first graduating class of--at Dillard University, and, and she had wanted to be a physician.  I didn't find that out 'til much later in life, but she wanted to be a physician, and my grandmother said, "Oh no, you won't do that."  And she didn't, but as it was, she was a science teacher, and very innovative, very dedicated, she taught herself photography, and she taught herself how to develop pictures.  And she taught that to her science students in the seventh through the ninth grade in Washington, D.C.  She was extremely compassionate, and truly the most optimistic person I ever knew.
Speaker 1: And what about your grandmother, did you spend time with her?  You--she--I mean, personal time, I know that you said, you lived in the house--
Speaker 2: No personal time (laughter), I had to tag along when she went shopping, and she, she liked to sew, and I don't know whether you're familiar with people--perhaps you do, but when you sew, you have to feel the material.  So she would touch every bolt of material in the millinery department, and had no intention of doing anything with any of them.  But no, I think she was close to my sister [Patricia Earles Carrington], but she wasn't necessarily close to me at all.
Speaker 1: What trait do you think that you acquired from your mother?  Or characteristic?
Speaker 2: An optimist.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That was my mother's gift to me.
Story_ID: 612005
Speaker 1: Well, let's, let's talk about your dad's side of the family, tell me your father's name, spell it for me and where he was born and when he was born.
Speaker 2: My father's name is Lucius Chism Earles, Jr. [Lucius Earles, Jr.]--
Speaker 1: Okay.  Could you spell the names for me please?
Speaker 2: Yes, L-U-C-I-O-U-S [sic.], C-H-I-S-M, and E-A-R-L-E-S.  So my father was born in St. Francisville, Louisiana and at some point, the family moved to Baton Rouge [Louisiana], or Scotlandville as it was then.  And I think they moved there for schooling purposes, I think my grandfather, my father's father [Lucius Earles, Sr.], was also a schoolteacher.  And interestingly, my grandfather taught my father in early schooling, as did my [maternal] grandmother [Lottye Grooms Daniels] taught my mother [Marion Daniels Earles].  My grandmother was an English teacher, and my grandfather taught at a little country school, but I think he may have taught something at Southern [Southern University; Southern University and Agricultural and Mechanical College, Baton Rouge, Louisiana], which was probably an agricultural school back then.  And so, my father grew up in Scotlandville, which is now a part of Baton Rouge, and it's a part where Southern University is.  And that's where he grew up, and he went to Southern University, and back then they spent about half of the year farming, and the other half year going to school, and that's what he did.  And he completed Southern in industrial arts, and he taught in the public schools of Washington, D.C. [District of Columbia Public Schools], carpentry and cabinet making.  And he taught day school, and then the night school, a couple of nights a week, and I was required to take his course, so I can hang a wall, and bang a nail, and saw a plank (laughter).  So my father was a very honest, hardworking man, very dedicated.
Story_ID: 612006
Speaker 1: And your grandfather, also a college graduate?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was, now you know I--he went to Natchez college [Jackson College; Jackson State University, Jackson, Mississippi].
Speaker 1: It's in Mississippi?
Speaker 2: That's in Mississippi, I understand that, see, my grandfather and his brothers and sisters all went to Natchez college, and they were living somewhere in Mississippi, but they went to Natchez because they could pay for education partially in crops, and so the whole family moved there, and so my father's father, and--
Speaker 1: What was your father's father's name?
Speaker 2: My father's father, Lucius, same thing, Lucius, he was senior [Lucius Earles, Sr.].  And so, he and his brothers and sisters all went to Natchez college, and after he graduated, they went to St. Francisville [Louisiana], and then subsequently to Baton Rouge [Louisiana].
Speaker 1: And your grandmother, on your father's side, your father's mother, what was her name?
Speaker 2: Her name was Sallie Sterling [Sallie Earles], and she was a high school graduate, or whatever the school, I don't know where that went, I don't know whether that was eighth, ninth, tenth, eleventh, twelfth grade, or whatever.  However, she was a student and my grandfather taught her.  And as my Aunt Eula [Eula Earles Harris], my father's sister said, Papa wanted to marry Mama and she said, "Well I haven't finished school, I have to finish school."  And he said, "I'll wait."  And he waited, and she finished, and they got married.  And he was the educated one in the family, but I guess she was the, the, strength of the family.
Speaker 1: And what would--why do you say that?
Speaker 2: Well, I think she ran things (laughter), she ran things and they all looked up to her.  She was warm but stern, and she made it clear about how she wanted our behavior.  And I'll see if I can tell you this, it's really difficult for me, thinking about it, it was wonderful--I'll come back to it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  What about their parents or your great-grandparents, do you have any knowledge of them?  Or anybody in slavery on your father's side?
Speaker 2: No, except let's see, he and my father's--my grandfather's father, I think his name was Stephen.  Stephen Earles.  And we found something in the Bible, and it said that--maybe this is my grandmother's side, inside it said Charlotte Arbothorst [Charlotte Earles] married Stephen Earles, 1873.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What was Charlotte's last name?
Speaker 2: Arbothorst.
Speaker 1: Do you know how to spell it?
Speaker 2: I think--I don't think it was--A-R, it may have been B-O-T-H-O-R-S-T.  And that was something we stumbled on recently, I think ten years ago, in the family Bible, and--
Speaker 1: And was it 1873 (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: Seventy-three [1873].  Yeah.  And that was--yeah, and she married Stephen Earles, who was evidently from Virginia who came with his master south, so I think she had a child by the slave master and as was the feeling then, you know people wanted to marry--I guess she was a light woman, wanted to marry the blackest man she could find (laughter).  And I guess Stephen Earles popped out of the woodwork, and hence the Earles group started.
Story_ID: 612007
Speaker 1: What characteristic do you believe you have from your father [Lucius Earles, Jr.]?
Speaker 2: My father was a perfectionist and a workaholic, and was very open, friendly, I get those things from him.  I'm too friendly to people (laughter).  I have conversations in the elevator, and my brother [Lucius Earles, III] says, "Oh, you're always talking to some strange people."  And he was a great guy.
Story_ID: 612008
Speaker 1: And your family on both sides or either side I should say, they owned the property that they lived on?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah they did, and it was very interesting, when we--I went back to, I went down to--I think last October to see my uncle [Marcus Earles, Sr.], who had had his ninetieth birthday in July, my father's birthday, and my uncle was my father's youngest brother, so he's ninety right now, and he taught at Grambling [Grambling College; Grambling State University, Grambling, Louisiana], and he retired from there.  And so, I went to visit him and I left and went to New Orleans [Louisiana], this was right around the time of my birthday and I was going home, and it's very--it was fascinating because the trip that I took was a little history of my family and it's happening again on highway 61 [U.S. Route 61], which is a scenic highway, and they went through Woodville, Mississippi and that's where my father's father was born.  Then it went to St. Francisville, Louisiana, that's where my father's mother [Sallie Earles] was born, and that is where my grandfather taught, so it makes sense.  Then it passed through St. Josephs, Louisiana, [sic. St. Joseph, Louisiana], which is where my father [Lucius Earles, Jr.] met my mother [Marion Daniels Earles], she went there to teach, and he went there to teach.  And then I realized, I said, oh, I'm on this road for a reason, and so I went to New Orleans--not New Orleans, Baton Rouge [Louisiana], 'cause highway 61 goes right to Scotlandville [Baton Rouge, Louisiana], and I felt as though I was getting close to where they lived on the farm and all.  And I stopped on the highway, there was a, an elderly black man sitting on his porch, and said, "Pardon me, sir," I said, "can you tell me where Blount Road is?"  Then he said, "It's right there at that light; you're right here at it."  And then he said, "Well, who might you be looking for?"  And I said, "Well, my grandfather and my father, you know used to live on Blount Road, my grandfather had a farm there and that's where my father grew up."  He said, "What would his name be?"  "His name was Lucius Earles [Lucius Earles, Sr.]."  And he said, "Lucius Earles!  That man taught me.  He taught me at the independent school in St. Francisville."  He said, "Oh that man just whacked my legs, and oh, he was just a wonderful man."  Yeah, and I said, "Yeah, he whacked mine too," (laughter).  And so we talked for a few minutes more and then I went to the cemetery where my grandmother and grandfather were born, and the cemetery, the plot was on--the cemetery was right next door to their farm, they eventually sold all the farm to the cemetery, and it's right there by the airport in Baton Rouge [Baton Rouge Metropolitan Airport].  And so, that's where the trip took me from--I--which I thought, was inadvertent from my father's brother to my grandparents.
Story_ID: 612009
Speaker 1: Tell me, you mentioned one uncle, what are the names of your other uncles on your, on your father's side (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) My father [Lucius Earles, Jr.], he had one brother and three sisters.  It was Aunt Eula [Eula Earles Harris], who in her story, she told me about my grandmother [Sallie Earles] getting married to my grandfather [Lucius Earles, Sr.], and hence, her point was my grandmother didn't finish school, and Aunt Eula did the same thing; she married Uncle Henry [Henry Harris, Sr.], and she, you know, finished high school, but that was it.  And she was the only one of my father's brothers and sisters--well, hi- only one of his sisters that hadn't finished college, but Aunt Bessie [Bessie Earles Preston] and Aunt Eula had both finished at Southern [Southern University; Southern University and Agricultural and Mechanical College, Baton Rouge, Louisiana] as well, as well as Uncle Marcus [Marcus Earles, Sr.], so there were four of them, I mean, five of them all together.
Speaker 1: And what about aunts and uncles on your mother's side?
Speaker 2: My mother [Marion Daniels Earles] had three sisters.  Her youngest one was Hubbardine [Hubbardine Daniels], who was named after my mother's father [Hubbard Daniels].  And Eunice [Eunice Daniels] and Doris [Doris Daniels], and they all taught school as well.  And my mother's youngest sister, Aunt Hubbard, she used to--she taught at the same school, grade school, that my sister [Patricia Earles Carrington] and I went to in New Orleans [Sylvanie F. Williams School, New Orleans, Louisiana], before we moved to Washington, D.C.
Story_ID: 612010
Speaker 1: Is there a story--well, there is a story, if you would tell me, how your mother [Marion Daniels Earles] and father [Lucius Earles, Jr.] met?
Speaker 2: My mother and father met because they was in this same little town, that's--in St.--in St. Josephs [sic. St. Joseph, Louisiana], see my mother was a city girl, she was from New Orleans [Louisiana] and she went to Dillard [Dillard University, New Orleans, Louisiana], and she got this teaching assignment and she went there, I guess the town was that big (laughter), and my father was a country boy, went there, and they was both in the same town teaching at the same school.  I don't know what their opening words were (laughter).
Speaker 1: So they got married--
Speaker 2: But it lasted sixty-one years.
Speaker 1: And after they married, they move to New Orleans?
Speaker 2: After they got married, yeah, they moved to New Orleans for a while, and they were to move to California 'cause like, as you know, black people seem to migrate straight somewhere, but the people down at the bottom, kind of went both ways (laughter).  And they were to go to Los Angeles [California], my father went out there for a while, and this was after World War II [WWII].  He went out there for a while, got lonely, and came back, and my mother's sister next to her, Eunice [Eunice Daniels], had gone to Washington, D.C., and as a result, then we followed and went there, yeah.
Story_ID: 612011
Speaker 1: Tell me your earliest childhood memory in New Orleans [Louisiana].
Speaker 2: Earliest childhood memory?  (Pause) I have kind of a bunch of them right there, you know, being in the backyard, the side yard, I can remember running under the tree because--in the front yard, because during the caterpillar season, caterpillars fell from the trees like raindrops, and you didn't want one on you because it was extremely frightful.  I can remember, maybe my grandmother--my [maternal] great-grandmother [Belinda Grooms] calling me to the kitchen because she would get some oranges, and she'd sprinkle something on them, and I don't know whether she'd give my brother [Lucius Earles, III] and sister [Patricia Earles Carrington] any or not, but she would call me to get some, and it was so special.  And she had a name for me, which I'm glad you mentioned that, because I said maybe it's some African dialect, but she called me Gina [ph.], "Gina!"  I had no idea what it meant, but she'd call me and maybe that's my really earliest memory.
Story_ID: 612012
Speaker 1: So you actually begin school, you're still in New Orleans [Louisiana], tell me about your earliest memory of school [Sylvanie F. Williams School, New Orleans, Louisiana]?
Speaker 2: Well, one of my earliest memories of school was getting vaccinated, I can remember standing in line, and they were gonna have a needle, and I said, oh my goodness, what am I gonna do?  And before I knew it, it was over and it wasn't the worst thing in the world.  And I don't remember anything about the classes, I can remember it was very popular back then to--it was so hot, that the principal had a hose, and he would literally wet us down and we'd run from the water, and I mean, we'd all get a little water on us and get wet, during lunchtime.  (Laughter) I can remember, my [maternal] aunt [Hubbardine Daniels], we'd walk to school and my aunt taught there, and we were--my sister [Patricia Earles Carrington] and I, were always behind her and seemed like when we walked, she was just seem like she was so far ahead of us (gesture), but she would stop and check on us: "Come on now, come on," and we'd go to school that way.
Speaker 1: What do you remember about the schoolhouse itself?
Speaker 2: Seemed like it was, I'm not--sort of yellowish wood, I don't remember very much about it, the class, the classrooms or anything.
Speaker 1: Now this was about 1945 or '46 [1946], is that right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it would have been about probably about forty-si- yeah, '46 [1946], '45 [1945], yeah, surely.
Speaker 1: And you went to school in New Orleans until the second grade?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think I was, I think I was in the third grade when we went to Washington [D.C.].
Speaker 1: So your aunt taught you there, were there any other teachers that you remember?
Speaker 2: Oh, no, no, no, my aunt just taught at that school.
Speaker 1: Oh, I see.
Speaker 2: Yeah, she didn't teach us at all, except for, we were always taught, all the school teachers around every--
Speaker 1: Were there any teachers that you do remember?
Speaker 2: Oh, in the--was he the third--when was this?  Mrs. Piper [ph.] was our teacher in the third grade, I think, yeah, third or fourth grade, yeah, Mrs. Piper.  And I remember the rest of (laughter) all the rest of my teachers, you know, fourth grade, I mean, the fifth grade, yeah.
Story_ID: 612013
Speaker 1: Well we'll talk about those teachers but--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, your, your family decided to move to D.C. [Washington, D.C.]--
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: --because your aunt was already there?
Speaker 2: Right, right, my aunt was there.  My aunt, my mother's sister, next to my mother [Marion Daniels Earles], my mother was the oldest, and Eunice [Eunice Daniels], or Nan [ph.] as we called her, was next to my mother, and that was her favorite person.
Speaker 1: So your father [Lucius Earles, Jr.] was able to get a job in D.C.?
Speaker 2: My father was--when we got to D.C., the D.C. school system [District of Columbia Public Schools] didn't recognize my parents' teaching credentials, so my mother took a job as a stenographer in the public school system there where she worked at two different schools during that time, and my father was--took a job that was in construction, and with a construction company.  And then they both went back to school to get whatever courses that they needed, and I think they went to Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.].   And so, they got the courses that they need, they took the test in District of Columbia, and they became teachers there in D.C. as they had done in Louisiana.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 612014
Speaker 1: Now when you lived in Louisiana, where you lived was rural or was it in the city?
Speaker 2: In the city, 2415 Magnolia Street [New Orleans, Louisiana], Jackson-6582 was the phone number (laughter).
Speaker 1: Tell me about that neighborhood so we can do a comparison of--
Speaker 2: It was very interesting that neighborhood.  We lived in a house which was a detached house I guess you'd say now, and it was not much room between the house on one side, and on the other side we had a side yard, which ran the length of it, and then a backyard.  And back then, there was a chicken coop in the back, and I think they had some chickens--I don't know.  And there was an ample--it seemed ample at the time, front porch.  And it's a lot of freedom, and it was a--and there were other houses on the block, I think most--I don't think there were any attached houses or anything like that.  They were mostly wooden houses, there were a couple of stucco houses.  Ms. Eleanor [ph.] and Mr. Jeff [ph.] lived next door, and apple chewing tobacco, he'd send me to the store to get some, and across the street was Peter Rooster [ph.] if you will (laughter), who was one of my playmates, and then up in one end was Billy [ph.], who was white, I think, a lot of the neighborhoods were integrated, and Tommy [ph.] lived at--on the other side below, he was white; we all played together.  And Esther [ph.] lived a couple of houses away, so we had--and Jacqueline [ph.] and Ruby Moore [ph.], they lived next door, and my first girlfriend Janie [ph.] (laughter), who lived around the corner, it was a happy little neighborhood, I think.
Speaker 1: Were the families two family households--two parent households?  I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: I think so, yeah.  I think by and large (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Do you know what the occupations of the--your friends' parents were?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: You have an idea?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Do you know who--who owned the stores in which you shopped in your neighborhood?
Speaker 2: I just remember--oh, one store was--I think the woman was Italian.  And then there was a pharmacy two blocks away, and the pharmacist was black, he was Creole, and his name was Desoit [ph.], and he had a daughter, Marilee, Sumarilee Desoit [ph.], who I think moved to New Orleans at--I mean to Washington [D.C.] at some time in the future, same time I was there, and that was--I may have seen or met her, but I was too shy to say anything to her.  Like, "Aren't you New Orleans?"  Et cetera, et cetera.  I was scared of my shadow back in those days.
Story_ID: 612015
Speaker 1: So now, you make this transition to Washington, D.C., tell me what that is like for you?
Speaker 2: The change to Washington was--it was a little difficult.  I didn't know anybody.  And I can just remember having two friends, Perry Hopkins [ph.] and another kid who lived around the corner from me, and I do remember we would go to school, and we'd come home for lunch, and my mother [Marion Daniels Earles] wasn't working and she'd fix us some lunch, and that was a very pleasant memory and experience, but I didn't have any buddies or anything.  The little buddy that I had, I think, probably before we moved, he beat me up on the playground (laughter), just all out of the blue, I was shocked and hurt, and never really been in a fight.  Just wasn't much of a fighter, I'll tell you that.  And but we played, the neighborhood, there were friends in the neighborhood, and oh yeah, we played ball, we did lots of things.  And we ran from the dog when he got out, Skippy, Doberman Pinscher (laughter).  Played in Henderson's Castle [Henderson Castle, Washington, D.C.], which was a empty house, which is very, which is, a very valuable piece of property now.
Speaker 1: The Henderson house, it was just a vacant house?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: That's--you all made up that name?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think we made it up, but it might have been passed on from something, Henderson's Castle, it's--I don't know if you know anything about D.C., it's right next to Meridian Park [Meridian Hill Park, Washington, D.C.] now, and there's a very expensive housing development on it, yeah.
Story_ID: 612016
Speaker 1: Tell me about your relationship with your, your siblings, tell me where you fall in line as far as birth and dates (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I'm the youngest, my sister's in the middle.
Speaker 1: What's, what are their names?
Speaker 2: My sister's name is Patricia, Patricia Ann Cecilia Earles [Patricia Earles Carrington], and she's just a year older and--how old?  A year and a half?  July, August, September; a year and three months older than I am.  So we were--always been just close, I guess we were biologically fairly close, and we remained close all these years.  My brother, Lucius Earles [Lucius Earles, III], again, was my--I guess he was my childhood hero, always wanted to be like my brother.  He's a dermatologist, here in Chicago [Illinois], I'm a dermatologist here in Chicago.  And I wasn't as close to him, you know, five years difference is a lot, but I admired him and we had a very close family (laughter), I mean just as a point of fact.  But because we think we're quite different, quite different, and I don't know, I better not say that (laughter), let's just say--
Speaker 1: We'll move on (laughter).
Speaker 2: We'll say the diff- is that young--as a rule.  As the younger children grow though, the children get growing pains (laughter).  (Unclear) don't do that one, but, that's what happens you see.  When you are an older child, and you're used to doing--used to being in front, you know, maybe used to, I held your hand to cross the street, you know, and got these people off your back, and did this and did that, then the feeling of the older ones is that they're always gonna be like that, and it's not the reality of how things are sometimes, so (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right.
Story_ID: 612017
Speaker 1: Tell me about your elementary school, you're going to the third grade in D.C. [Washington, D.C.], right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: What was the name of the school--well tell me the name of the school in New Orleans [Louisiana] first.
Speaker 2: Name of the school in New Orleans was Sylvanie Williams [Sylvanie F. Williams School], yeah, that was the name of the school in New Orleans.
Speaker 1: And in D.C.?
Speaker 2: And in D.C., it was Morgan Demonstration School [Thomas P. Morgan Demonstration School; Thomas P. Morgan Elementary School, Washington, D.C.], named after Garrett Morgan [sic.], one of the inventors of things.
Speaker 1: Tell me about your influences.  What was influencing you at that, your elementary school age, from third grade to the sixth grade elementary school?
Speaker 2: No, third and fourth, then we moved--then we moved--
Speaker 1: And then you moved again?  Okay, third and fourth.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Third and fourth, I think, I was just getting adjusted to life in Washington, D.C.  And I was very shy and insecure, and (pause) I can't remember too much about that except--
Speaker 1: Any teachers, any--
Speaker 2: There was Iris Joy [ph.], who was--oh, she was a fellow student, and I was in love with Iris Joy, she was (laughter) I think she was a classmate. I would never of course say anything to her, but I re- I do remember that (laughter).
Speaker 1: So your family moves from D.C., or they move out of that neighborhood?
Speaker 2: No, we, we moved out of that neighborhood, and, and they bought a house.  We were living in an apartment on Ontario Road, then we bought, they bought a house in the Northeast section of Washington, and so went to another school.
Speaker 1: And what was that school?
Speaker 2: That school was Charles Young Platoon School [Washington, D.C.] it was called, and so, that was in the fifth grade.  Frances R. Brown [ph.] was the teacher, and all of us fellas had a crush on Ms., Mrs. Brown, she was just wonderful.
Speaker 1: What activities did you participate in school?
Speaker 2: Well, I don't know whether they had any after school activities or clubs (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) No, during school, were you in music, did you take art, or?
Speaker 2: Oh, well at Charles Young school, what happened was, we changed classes at the fifth grade, so there was Mrs. Reed [ph.] was the music teacher, and Mrs. I.R. Brown [ph.] was the art teacher there, and "My name is Ms. Burk [ph.], you came here to work" was the social studies teacher (laughter).  And then there was another Mrs. Brown [ph.] who was the math teacher.  And so we, we had a--and Mrs. Winston [ph.] was the principal.  We had a kind of a formal grounding in school in different subjects.  I don't know whether there were any, you know, whether there were any clubs, like a math club or anything like that I had.
Story_ID: 612018
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well what about outside of school, was your family involved in the church at all?
Speaker 2: My mother [Marion Daniels Earles] was always involved in the church, and my father [Lucius Earles, Jr.] wasn't, and we used to go to church, it was, yeah, we had to go to church.
Speaker 1: What church did you attend?
Speaker 2: You know I don't know the name of that church because I did not like going to church.
Speaker 1: What religion was it?
Speaker 2: Methodist, and as a matter of fact, I must have been ten or eleven when my mother would call me, and she would call me, and, "Come on, now get up and let's go to church."  And I can remember when she came upstairs, and, and (gesture) I had the blanket over my bed and, oh my god, and then she said, "I'll tell you what, I'll make a bargain with you. If you just go to church today, and you talk with the minister, and then you don't want to go, then you don't have to."  (Gesture) I pulled the cover, I said, "You," (laughter), "are you serious?  Are you--really Mommy?"  And she said yes.  So I went there, this was a piece of cake, I talked to the minister, said goodbye (laughter).  And then I did that again when I finished high school [Calvin Coolidge High School; Calvin Coolidge Senior High School, Washington, D.C.], when I finished college [Howard University, Washington, D.C.], and when I finished, finished medical school [Howard University College of Medicine, Washington, D.C.].
Story_ID: 612019
Speaker 1: What were your desires or, or, dreams?  What did you think that you would become, or what, you know, as a child, what did you wanna do when you finished school?
Speaker 2: Well, it was my intent to, certainly when I finished high school [Calvin Coolidge High School; Calvin Coolidge Senior High School, Washington, D.C.] to become an engineer.  I liked tinkering with things and building things and figuring things out.  And I wrote my senior term paper on engineering as a career, and I applied to--I went to Howard University [Washington, D.C.], and I applied to the School of Engineering [School of Engineering and Architecture; College of Engineering and Architecture].  And you know took a lot of my (unclear) classes, et cetera.  And so I got accepted to the School of Engineering.  And I really changed my mind over that summer, thought that maybe I will want to deal with lifes--life sciences then (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) But at this time, as a--elementary school, getting ready to go into high school, or junior high school, is that what you thought at that time?  'Cause you know a lot of times--
Speaker 2: That time--
Speaker 1: --it changes as we get older.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Do you remember what you might have been thinking then?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's fine.
Speaker 2: No.
Story_ID: 612020
Speaker 1: Now let's move on to junior high school, what junior high school did you attend?
Speaker 2: I went to Hugh M. Browne Junior High School [Washington, D.C.], (singing), "Browne Junior High, so brave, so strong, we're Browne Junior High so proud."  (Laughter) Yeah.
Speaker 1: And what was life like?  Did you walk to school, was the school--because now, we're 19--we're past that, Brown versus the Board of Education [Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954], are the schools integrated (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, we weren't up to Brown versus the Board of Education then.
Speaker 1: In 1950, went--to go to junior high school?
Speaker 2: No, Brown versus the Board of Education--
Speaker 1: That was in '54 [1954].
Speaker 2: --was implemented in '54 [1954], yeah.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So this was still--
Speaker 1: Junior high school?
Speaker 2: You see, there were divisions, there was division one, which was the white schools, and division two, which were black.  And so Browne was--yeah, integration hadn't come.  And we had all black students, all black teachers, and all black principals.  All black custodians; (laughter) everybody was black.  And so Browne was--
Speaker 1: Okay, so we're, we're, we're, all right in 1952 then about--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --right?
Speaker 2: Yeah fi- that would be--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --fifty-two [1952] or '53 [1953] and '54 [1954].  Yeah, '52 [1952], that would make sense.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, tell me are you involved more in school activities and are there any activities outside of school?  Tell me what's influencing you, in junior high school.
Speaker 2: Oh, in junior high school, well, there were a lot of kids in the neighborhood, and we just sort of--the--at least in our community there were not organized--except in the summer.  Baseball, was an organized thing, but at least, not to my knowledge, there weren't any organized activities.  We just went out and played and you played basketball, we had horseshoes, we played football, we, we went swimming in a local creek, and that's what we did.  Yeah.  And I'll tell you about that school, it was, oh, it was really something, Browne Junior High School, it was extremely strict.  The principal was Hugh Stinson [sic. William B. Stinson], I think his name was.
Speaker 1: Hugh Stinson?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think so, yeah.  And he had more rules and regulations than you can imagine.
Speaker 1: What were some of them?
Speaker 2: Well, first of all, you had to wear a tie to school, and if you didn't wear a tie, you had to go home and get one, or if you didn't want to do that, they would tie something around your, your neck.  If you were late for school, you had to go to 104, which was detention hall for minor truancy, like lateness, you had to stay an hour.  Major truancy, or behavioral problems, such as fighting or something like that, you went to 105; you stayed for two hours.  There was a gum patrol, if you were chewing gum and were caught, you would get a detention slip--that was a 104.  You had a--there was a hall patrol, you had to walk on twos, both sides of the halls, if you ventured on the other (gesture), there was a hall patrol, 104, fellow students.  There was a grass patrol, if you stepped on the grass, the green gold?  Shoot, 104, you better go (gesture) (laughter).  There were cafeteria monitors that were monitoring how you ate and then there was, (laughter) and then the assistant principal would grade you on how you ate: "This is section, section one, showed very good manners and wasn't very noisy.  But there was a little trash on the floor, however; section one gets a B."  And she would go around the four sections (laughter).  Our section was--I was very quiet but was in with some rowdy people, we frequently had to eat on silent periods (laughter).
Story_ID: 612021
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What type of student were you?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I was, I was, I usually made the honor roll, I would get with my oldest friend, my oldest this friend in seventh grade there was fun, we were in the seventh grade, eighth grade, and we went to high school together [at Calvin Coolidge High School; Calvin Coolidge Senior High School, Washington, D.C.], went to Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] together--
Speaker 1: And what his name?
Speaker 2: Oh, James McDowell [ph.], and I can remember one time--and I had, you know, I had about two As and five Bs once, and James got about five As and two Bs, he was always very smart.  And, but I was usually a B, B plus student.
Speaker 1: So you were a good student but what type of child were you, were you mischievous?  Sound like you had--
Speaker 2: No, oh, no, no, no, I was, I wasn't mischievous, I was--
Speaker 1: I know you said you were shy.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: By the time you got to junior high school [Hugh M. Browne Junior High School, Washington, D.C.] were you starting to come out of your shell?
Speaker 2: Oh no.  (Laughter) I was trying to find my way in.  And I did have a lot of friends, in the neighborhood because you know I was pretty good athletically, and we played some kind of ball all the time.  And so, I was, I had friends in the neighborhood, and one of the--sort of the border line--the neighborhood was changing and we used to do little mischievous things like, when, you remember the Coca-Cola, things, or Pepsi Cola, they would open on the side, we might take a little six pack, and we might do some other things, and I never even thought about it, and then, when some of my friends found a newspaper boy's receipts, and they collected on his paper route, you know on the block where we lived, like, like the people didn't know, you're not the paper boy.  I was angry, I was left out of that.  And my mother [Marion Daniels Earles] said, we need to get out of this neighborhood because this boy is just--I'm gonna--he's about to fall into, with the wrong group of people.  So we moved (laughter).
Story_ID: 612022
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So you bought another house?  'Cause your family had bought a home by this time (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, that's right.
Speaker 1: 'But the neighborhood was changing, so your family--
Speaker 2: It was changing.
Speaker 1: So where did you move to?
Speaker 2: We moved to another section of Washington [D.C.], which was the Northwest section of Washington, and it was mostly white and in fact, mostly Jewish, or largely Jewish.  And I went to--I was in the eighth grade [at Hugh M. Browne Junior High School, Washington, D.C.], and there were about, I don't know, four or five black kids in the school.  Molly Birch [ph.], was my teacher, she was the homeroom teacher, she was Jewish, and there were--there was one other black kid in my class, Diane Millard [ph.], I think she was, and I think we were the only seniors.  Then we went to high school, and it was mostly a Jewish high school, and Yom Kippur came, and Rosh Hashanah, hey, the school was empty.  Maybe--
Speaker 1: Did they close the school or did those Jewish children just not attend?
Speaker 2: Oh, Jewish kids didn't attend.
Speaker 1: What was the name of the high school that you went to?
Speaker 2: That was Coolidge High School [Calvin Coolidge High School; Calvin Coolidge Senior High School, Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 1: Now Coolidge was--
Speaker 2: (Singing), "Oh, Coolidge High, we sing to thee," (laughter).
Speaker 1: It was predominantly, predominantly white, is what you're saying?
Speaker 2: Oh, very definitely, when we finished there were three hundred--330 kids or so in the graduating class, and we had about eleven or twelve black students.
Speaker 1: So, tell me about the experience at, at Coolidge.
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: What did you gain from that school and I mean, who were your influences there as well?
Speaker 2: Well, one of the things about Coolidge High School was and--as you recall during that time, it was a very difficult time, because it was an onset of integration all over the South and plenty of the border states, and northern, some of the northern states as well.  And so there was a lot of the hostility and travail, and very difficult time for a lot of students.  But it was not for us at Coolidge High School, you see.  And I think it's primarily because most of the kids were Jewish, you see, and that just wasn't their shtick (laughter), if you will, they, they welcomed us, they were friendly to us, and we were friendly to them (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) But you went there because you lived in that neighborhood?
Speaker 2: I lived in that neighborhood.
Speaker 1: So it wasn't--they didn't see you as being forced to integrate their school. You were there because you lived in the neighborhood, so it kind of made a difference, don't you think?
Speaker 2: Could be, except for we didn't see many of them in the neighborhood at all because we didn't interact with them socially, so I don't even know where most of them lived.  And like, we wouldn't see them walking down the streets or anything like that so, yeah, they must have lived in another part of the same neighborhood, but, but yeah, we were not bussed there, and I would think that would make a difference.
Story_ID: 612023
Speaker 1: Now, can I throw this in about my grandmother?
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  This is what my father's mother [Sallie Earles] used to say.  I was sitting on the--we were on the front porch and some kids passed by and they weren't being raucous, but it clearly, in retrospect, my grandmother thought they were.  And it was something about girlfriend, boyfriends, and I said, "Mama, you have a boyfriend?"  She said, "My only boyfriend is right over there," because the cemetery was right there, and he [Earles' grandfather, Lucius Earles, Sr.] was buried right there.  And she said to me, and she looked real disparagingly at the kids passing by and she said, "Some people don't know right from wrong," she said, "but your name is Earles [HistoryMaker Dr. Rene Martin Earles], and you do.  And I want you to do right."  And I said, "Okay, Mama."  And then she said, "And another thing: don't follow the crowd 'cause the crowd will get you in trouble."  "Okay, Mama."  And the last thing she said was: "And always listen to your mother [Marion Daniels Earles] and father [Lucius Earles, Jr.]," so.  (Pause) So, well this, just had to say.
Speaker 2: So you were very close to your grandmother?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Let me (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So that's some of the guiding principles--
Speaker 2: That you follow.
Speaker 1: --of my life (laughter).
Story_ID: 612024
Speaker 1: We were talking about Coolidge High School [Calvin Coolidge High School; Calvin Coolidge Senior High School, Washington, D.C.] and the fact that we are now in the era of integrating schools--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and the fact that you were going to Coolidge because you lived in, in the neighborhood, but of course, the integration was going on, and it was causing problems elsewhere.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But let's talk about your time, your personal experience, in time at Coolidge.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: (TAPE INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 1: All right, so we were talking about Coolidge, once again.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So tell me about your time, tell me about some of the teachers and the activities.
Speaker 2: Oh, Coolidge High School was a great school.  Porky, we used to call him, he was the principal, he looked like Porky Pig, Cedrick something--Cedrick O. Reynolds [Cedrick Reynolds] was the teacher.  My homeroom teacher was Donald Seylands [ph.], he wasn't much older than us, he was about twenty-six, he was the driver's ed [driver education] teacher and he married Marlene Wyman [ph.], I think, was one of our--my classmates.  (Laughter) So, didn't marry her right away, but he did marry her.  And then, we had Ms. Halworth [ph.], who was the English teacher who was English.  Dr. Liebermann who was history teacher, Dr. Fisher [ph.] who was the math teacher, geometry, trigonometry, (unclear) geometry, Ms. Smith [ph.].  All the teachers were white.  We did get a black teacher, a Mrs. Scott, Bebe Scott [ph.], who taught physics maybe when I was a senior.  And one of the things that I got, maybe the most important thing that I got out of Coolidge High School, aside from a good education, was the posture towards learning, which I learned from the Jewish kids.  I mean, they were serious as a heart attack about getting this education.  Now, I came from an educated family (laughter) you know, we took study seriously, but this was a whole new thing.  And I said oh, my god, these people are gonna kill for some knowledge, and so that was a good experience, you know, and the experience got to be better as I found out I could, you know, compete academically with them very well.  And one of my fond memories of back then was English class, given by the English teacher Ms. Halworth who had the habit of, habit of, keeping the highest papers until last, you see, so she would--everybody would get their paper back, but the top five papers she would keep.  And she had to--she finally--I can remember at one point, her saying, "And the highest score as usual was Rene [HistoryMaker Dr. Rene Martin Earles]," and I sat in the back and I had to walk to the front, and I was--so you know, I was the top student in a lot of classes, and did well there so I felt confident academically (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Who were--who were some of your classmates?
Speaker 2: Classmates?  Well, there was Eddie Berg [ph.], Bernie Rubenstein [ph.], Ian Schenk [ph.], Elliot Cohan [ph.], C-O-H-A-N, Michael Cohen [ph.], C-O-H-E-N (laughter), and Ralph Dweck [ph.], D-W-E-C-K, Warren Payne [ph.].  Jim McDowell [James McDowell (ph.)] was still there; we were there together again.
Story_ID: 612025
Speaker 1: So now, are you still thinking about becoming an engineer?
Speaker 2: Oh yes, I was an engineer up until I finished high school [Calvin Coolidge High School; Calvin Coolidge Senior High School, Washington, D.C.], wrote my senior term paper on engineering as a career, yeah.
Speaker 1: And how did you decide what schools you would apply to for college?
Speaker 2: What college?  Well, let's see, back in those days, not many people went away, and certainly people I know didn't go away, and I guess there were people who were going away, but I didn't know 'em, and my other little group of people who were gonna, if you weren't gonna go away then you were gonna stay wherever you were, and you went to schools wherever you were.  And I think, let me see, was University of Maryland [College Park, Maryland], these schools were mostly white and there was Wilson Teachers College [University of the District of Columbia, Washington, D.C.], which was white, and I wasn't gonna to teach anyway.  So, there was the local black teachers college, it was just Miner [Miner Teachers College; University of the District of Columbia, Washington, D.C.], and then there was Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.].  And I mean knew kids were going to Hampton [Hampton Institute; Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia], but it didn't occur to me at point.  My brother [Lucius Earles, III] was at Howard, my parents [Marion Daniels Earles and Lucius Earles, Jr.] had been there to take their other courses, so it didn't even occur to me to go anywhere else.
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: Jim [James McDowell (ph.)] was going there.
Speaker 1: Now, the area in which you lived was near Walter Reed hospital, or med- Army Medical [Walter Reed Army Medical Center; Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, Washington, D.C.]. Had you even given any thought to becoming a doctor?
Speaker 2: Not really, I don't think so, I always liked science, and I, you know, and, and I liked biology, but I was--I was may either going the mechanical engineering or civil engineering.
Story_ID: 612026
Speaker 1: Did you have a prom at your high school [Calvin Coolidge High School; Calvin Coolidge Senior High School, Washington, D.C.]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Who did your take to the prom?
Speaker 2: I took Sylvia Welch [ph.], Sylvia had come there from Detroit [Michigan].  And oh god, she was a gorgeous girl, and I had no idea how she sort of picked me out of this group of people 'cause, you see 'cause I was just scared to death (laughter).  And I'll tell you something really funny, so, Jim McDowell [James McDowell (ph.)] and I are going to prom together, I'm taking Sylvia and he was taking his girl, and we were gonna have my father's [Lucius Earles, Jr.] car, and two funny things that happened, and so, I'm driving and I practiced, I said, "Look, Mac," you see, I had my hand around (gesture) Sylvia, who's not in the car, I'm pretending, I'm showing him how I can drive with one hand and one hand around her.  You know, like, look at what I can do (laughter).  And so when the prom night, I didn't try that--.  Oh--
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: (TAPE INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So on prom night I didn't feel confident about that and Jim in the back seat said, "Oh, why don't you drive with one hand and put your other arm around Sylvia?  After all, you've been practicing all week."  (Laughter) That's my buddy.  And another thing that happened, he picked up something, when--and I picked up the orchids, you know, and the flowers, and I had never, but anyway, he had flowers (unclear), and he said we'll put 'em in the refrigerator.  Put 'em in the refrigerator, and it must have been halfway through the prom, we looked at these flowers, they looked like they're turning brown and, oh, how the heck did this happen?  Well I didn't know you weren't supposed to put the flowers in the freezer compartment of the refrigerator (laughter).  I had killed the flowers (laughter), oh boy.
Story_ID: 612027
Speaker 1: You graduate in 1954, and you were accepted to Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.], where you applied.  And so tell me about that transition, who, who pa- who paid for you to go to college, and we didn't talk about whether you had any jobs, even for the summer, and so tell me, tell me about that.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Let me see, did I work in high school [Calvin Coolidge High School; Calvin Coolidge Senior High School, Washington, D.C.]?  I don't think so I don't think I worked in high school.  No, I had--when I was in junior high school [Hugh M. Browne Junior High School, Washington, D.C.] I had a paper route for a short period of time.  I wasn't a good early morning person, didn't like that.  And however, no, towards the end of high school, I did have a job, I had a--because I still had it in col- I had a paper route my senior year, The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times, so, not everybody got that paper, so you needed a car and so you were in kind of a wealthy area of the city.  So you got up about--picked up your papers about two o'clock, and you worked 'til four, and then that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So did you get a scholarship to go to school?
Speaker 2: To Howard?
Speaker 1: Yes.  Or did your parents [Marion Daniels Earles and Lucius Earles, Jr.] pay?
Speaker 2: No, I think, I think they paid, I must have paid maybe half of it, because I got a job, I decided, oh, I can't do this, keep serving these papers like this.  And so I got a job at the drugstore.  And I think the last two years I paid my tuition out of my earnings from the drugstore (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) While you were you in college or in high school?  In college?
Speaker 2: Yeah, in college, yeah.
Speaker 1: In college.  Okay.  So you go to Howard in 1954, is that right?
Speaker 2: Fifty-five [1955], yeah.
Speaker 1: Fifty-five [1955]?  Okay.  And--
Speaker 2: No, no, I can't get to Howard yet, I'm--I didn't finish high school 'til '58 [1958].
Speaker 1: I mean fifty--I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: Fifty-eight [1958].
Speaker 1: I'm sorry, I meant 1958 is when you graduated from high school going to Howard.
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Story_ID: 612028
Speaker 1: Talk to me about your very first day, your--the memory that comes to your mind about your first day at Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 2: First day at Howard I think we were welcomed by the president of Howard.
Speaker 1: And who was the president then?
Speaker 2: It was Mordecai Johnson: "Gimme that good ol' Howard spirit, gimme that good ol' Howard spirit.  It's good enough for Mordecai Johnson, it's good enough for me."  Mordecai Johnson was a preacher, a distinguished, tall or erect man, by god, Mordecai Johnson must have talked for two hours or so, I thought I was gonna die.  I had no idea what he was saying (laughter).  He welcomed us to Howard and the Howard experience, et cetera, et cetera, and I think we were standing somewhere on campus, so.  Mordecai, got through it.  And I was feeling brave, you see, there were people, by this time, I was very insecure (unclear), there were people I had been to other schools with along the way who were there, but I was sort of never felt--I meant, it took me a long time.  Years and years before I felt sort of okay about myself, and vis a vis, other people.  I say--guess you'd say I had an inferiority complex, yeah, that's, that would be--.  Because I knew people, you see, and then when I get in the group, I didn't feel like I was part of the group, et cetera, et cetera, so this colored my whole experience at Howard, although I have enormously good experience and memories there.
Speaker 1: Well, share some of those memories of Howard.  Now, you, you at this point are still looking at engineering?
Speaker 2: No, because I reapplied over the summer to the school of liberal arts [College of Arts and Sciences], and so I was in liberal arts then.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I took freshman chemistry, and all those things, the life sciences, all those things towards--
Speaker 1: So, your chemistry, after taking one, two, or--what made you decide that chemistry and biog- and biology--
Speaker 2: Well, most the kids who were in biology wanted to go to medical school, it was just--medical school and dental school, that was sort of--.  Well (unclear) kids are sort of highly educationally motivated, they either wanted a Ph.D., and so they didn't just want to be a biologist, they wanted something beyond that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But what I'm saying is that you get your degree in chemistry, don't you?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And biology?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I have a double degree.
Speaker 1: So, I'm trying to determine, when did you decide that this was something that you--because you started out in engineering--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --go to liberal arts to find your way--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --when was the chemistry and biology, when did that kick in?
Speaker 2: Well, I always liked biology.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Always, I always liked science and even in the, in the seventh and the--seventh grade [at Hugh M. Browne Junior High School, Washington, D.C.].  I mean I took physics, I mean, I always liked biology from the beginning. It's just that I like the mechanical things and mathematical manipulations that somehow, somehow--I don't know why I decided that I wanted to deal with living, living things as opposed to non-living things.
Story_ID: 612029
Speaker 1: Well, you said you had some memorable stories. Le- share some of those stories about the Howard experience [Howard University, Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 2: Oh, well, there were, there were so many different people from so many different places there that--and different cultures, that's one of the things that made things so interesting.  So, all these strange accents that you heard and trying to figure out what they're saying and people from different areas of the country, and different ways of doing things that (unclear).  And I have a classmate right now, who's in St. Thomas [U.S. Virgin Islands], he's from St. Thomas, we were in, you know, freshman ROTC [Reserve Officers' Training Corps] together and we went through and went through medical school [Howard University College of Medicine, Washington, D.C.] together (laughter) and so we're classmates in medical school, classmates in undergrad school.  And there were a number of people like that, may- I don't know maybe ten or twelve of us, who were--that started and finished at the same time.  And there were various, little, just probably maybe just little things, rather than say enormous, big things that happened.  I pledged into a fraternity.
Speaker 1: Which fraternity?
Speaker 2: Kappa Alpha Psi [Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity], and it was a--we had a little song (singing), "You get a lot to like with a Kappa man, handsome, cultured, intelligent," which all, I was all that.  But I didn't really feel that, as, as much as, as most of the guys in my group. I was just a shy kid, and that was all there was to it.
Speaker 1: What was the climate like as far as student activism beginning to happen at Howard in the early '60s [1960s]?
Speaker 2: Well, I think it was, but I was in medical school by then, and we didn't know very much about anything except for what was going in those books.
Speaker 1: Well you, let me see, you finished your undergrad (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) We watched Freedom Rides and stuff, we watched the Freedom Rides and stuff.
Speaker 1: Okay, but you didn't graduate your undergrad until '63 [1963].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And do you remember the March on Washington?
Speaker 2: I went to the March on Washington.
Speaker 1: You went to the march?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was there, it was--
Speaker 1: And what was that experience like?
Speaker 2: Oh, it was wonderful, it was.
Speaker 1: Do you remember anything that really stands out besides the speech [I Have a Dream], about being among all those people?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But it was certainly just an incredible feeling, yeah.
Speaker 1: And Stokely Carmichael--
Speaker 2: And I think I, I think I went by myself, I don't remember being there with anyone.
Speaker 1: Did you know Kwame Ture?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.  He was a year behind you at that time.
Story_ID: 612030
Speaker 1: So now, in your undergrad [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] (clears throat), this is when you decide that you want to become a doctor.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay, do you remember when that might have been and did you always know that you're just going to apply to Howard medical school [Howard University College of Medicine, Washington, D.C.] or did you apply to other schools?
Speaker 2: No, I didn't apply anywhere else.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I applied at one college, and one medical school (laughter).  No, my brother [Lucius Earles, III] went to Howard's medical school.  My brother was leaving I think, he was leaving when I got there.  And although--I don't know when my brother decided, because he majored in physical education and I think it was a latent thought of his.  And sitting here talking with you, if he finished in '60 [1960], when I got there, which was '63 [1963], that means he must have started in '59 [1959]?  Fifty-nine [1959], so I suspect that, that had some influence upon me and my decision to do that, yeah.
Story_ID: 612031
Speaker 1: Who were some of the students in your, in medical school [Howard University College of Medicine, Washington, D.C.] with you?
Speaker 2: Oh, shucks, there was Omega Silva [Omega Logan Silva], Claudenia Young [sic. Claudia Young], Bobby Farmer [Robert Farmer], my cousin Felton Earls [HistoryMaker Felton James Earls], Chester Gee, and William Alonzo Amos Foster [William A. Foster] (laughter), Wilma Calendar [ph.], oh my god that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So tell me your experience though, give me some stories about your experience in, in medical school.
Speaker 2: Oh, now medical school.  By the time I got to medical school I was just total- most totally disorganized person, and I can remember walking around in medical school, and there were some pre- pre-o [pre-orientation] class openings, studies that people were enrolled in--you know, this is medical school, this is what you're gonna have to do, these are the books you're gonna have, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah.  And I wasn't involved in any of that.  So I got to medical school, kind of late.  Classes went up and down. I would do brilliantly one semester. Now I never did really bad, maybe one semester I was pledging this fraternity business [Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity], and I could remember going to the, going to the, dean's office to see whether I was going to get in medical school.  And she--the woman in her office commented about, "You know you just, I don't understand how you do really well, and then you dip down here, and then you go up here."  And she got to the point about my MCAT exam, and you know, she said, "Oh," she said, "you'll get in," she said, "you made the highest mark for anybody who took it."  So I felt, and I was aware that I had been like this (gesture), and I was also aware that the kids who were in there were much more even, you know, than I was.  So when I got there, they were, you know they knew how to--I didn't know how to plan and do things in an organized manner, I just didn't know how to do that.  And so, I wondered where they got these books from (laughter), and it must have been about six weeks or so, I finally said, oh, you better get some books.  And I got some books, and so I was in medical school, and, and I didn't belong because of my, you know, record of ups and downs, I didn't belong to any honor, honor societies, and they belonged to a bunch of honor societies, and I said, oh, that was a little intimidating.  And then when we got the first exams, I did well.  There were a hundred--106 kids and I think the anatomy exam was given, and I think I got about the sixth highest mark, and about the tenth in biochemistry, and I said, oh, I can do this.  But what happened was that eight hours of class I didn't do well in; I couldn't listen all that time, and I found out I was sort of missing what was going on.  Because I might sit in class, and the next thing I know, the chairs are moving, class is over.  And I, I, didn't think it was abnormal back then, but I couldn't keep up with my notebooks, you know, the notebooks that you take the notes on.  (Unclear) books, but didn't have a pen, I didn't--you know I can remember going to the bathroom getting some (laughter), some hand towels to write on and so, it didn't take me long--.  Now what happened in this particular year in my school, decision was made that you didn't have to come to class.  You know they used to have to go to class every day, and they had take to notes, and they give quizzes based on the notes, and the book, and that was for two years.  But for some reason, when I got there, they said, oh, you don't have to come to class, you know, don't have to worry about these notes, you have three exams a year.  So when I found out I wasn't, couldn't listen to all of them, then I spent most of my time at the library.  So for the first two years that's essentially where I said, well, if it's in the book, I'll get it; if it's not in the book, I'm not gonna worry about it, so that's the way I went through the first two years.
Story_ID: 612032
Speaker 1: And what changed after that for you, so that, you know, you went through that the first two years [at Howard University College of Medicine, Washington, D.C.], what changed after that, for the next?
Speaker 2: Well, the next two years, well the next two years was different because it's a different type of learning.  You had to be in the hospital, and you had to be over here at a certain time, you had to be over there.  Audio learning was important, you know, patient comes in he's been into the hospital, and you had to present the case. I'm scared anyway, you had to present the case, and then you had to listen as people were talking, and as they were talking, I just, you know, I was missing most of that.  It's just not a way that I found out that I did well at.  And it wasn't, it wasn't until years later that, that it seems as though it's pretty clearly I had some type of attention deficit disorder that is of the inattentive type; I'm never like this (gesture), but my mind just kind of goes where it wants to go when it wants to go, depending on what its, what's going on.
Story_ID: 612033
Speaker 1: So you get through Howard medical school [Howard University College of Medicine, Washington, D.C.] in 1967.  Now tell me, who were the, the deans?  There are two different deans while you're there, is that right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, the first dean was Dean Jason.
Speaker 1: Robert Jason [Robert S. Jason]?
Speaker 2: He was second, yeah, Robert Jason, and K. Albert Harden.
Speaker 1: Now, let me ask you about a few other people who attended Howard.  Gloria Bacon [HistoryMaker Dr. Gloria Jackson Bacon], is she someone that you knew?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, Gloria Bacon, is, was born in New Orleans [Louisiana], and lives in--she went to Howard [sic.], then I think she went to University of Illinois [University of Illinois College of Medicine, Chicago, Illinois], and she's had a kind of a pioneering practice. She served the underprivileged here in Chicago [Illinois] and (unclear).
Speaker 1: Tell me some of the other influential professors, I know I asked you about your, people that you know, but thinking about it, who was an influential professor while you were there?
Speaker 2: W. Montague Cobb [William Montague Cobb], and when our class would get together: "Remember when Cobbs said this, that, or the other?"  And there was--well, I'll tell you about Cobb.  Cobbs had--gave this lecture, "Today we're gonna talk about the most important sound in the world, the sound of the human heart.  So how fitting it is for us to talk about that most important sound, and the language which all men understand: the language of music."  So then Cobb went to the board, and he drew a G clef, is that what you call it?  (Gesture) Drew the lines.  "The first heart sound is a B flat," (gesture) (laughter) drew that, and then he drew the second heart sound, and then he drew some abnormal heart sounds, you see.  And then he reached under his podium and took out his violin, and he strummed the heart sounds, and then (gesture) he played his--the violin (laughter) (makes sounds).  And that was the end.  I said, my god, this is medical school (laughter), this is going to be wonderful.  So you never knew what Cobb was going to do, you see, but a brilliant man.  W. Montague Cabb, and as Dean Jason said about Dr. Leffall, he said, "Tomorrow you're going to meet with Dr. LaSalle Leffall [HistoryMaker Dr. LaSalle D. Leffall, Jr.], and--from the department of surgery.  By any yard stick you use, you will find that Dr. Leffall stands quite tall."  And it was true (laughter). Man's a genius, he was, he was so smart and witty, and, and everything.  Well, one of the outstanding people and for instance, if I'm not mistaken, at some point they offered Leffall the chairmanship of slergy--surgery at Sloan Kettering [Memorial Hospital and the Sloan Kettering Institute; Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York], okay?  The cancer (laughter), you know, Sloan Kettering.  And, oh, they made such a--Dr. Cheek [HistoryMaker James Cheek] was the president at Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] then, oh, they made such, you know, "Oh my god," you know, such moaning and wailing that he decided to stay at Howard.  But truly brilliant man.  And when I had surgery, I had some surgery, it was a question of whether I had cancer, and I said, oh, my god, well, I need to go to D.C. [Washington, D.C.], and have Leffall do this, because I knew, hey, if Leffall can't do it, it wasn't meant to be, and then my time had come, it was as simple as that.  Because you see, not only I'm a dermatologist, but I also took some surgery, you see. I was going into--
Speaker 1: I see that.
Speaker 2: --orthopedic surgery.  And I'd operated with him, and I knew, you know.  Go ahead.
Speaker 1: What were your memories about Dr. Burke Syphax?
Speaker 2: Dr. Burke Syphax, he had a very sharp mind, his reasoning ability, his calm demeanor, but his inquisitiveness, and his conduct with surgical conferences, it was just really brilliant, it was--he was organized and he was a great surgeon, yeah.
Story_ID: 612034
Speaker 1: So now, you talked about surgery, so you did your first internship in general surgery, is that right?
Speaker 2: I did, I did an internship in what's called a rotating internship, I had some anesthesiology, some medicine, some surgery.  Thereupon, I decided to go into orthopedic surgery because I didn't figure I could stay sane enough to be a psychiatrist.  I'd worked in a psychiatric hospital during my senior year [at Howard University College of Medicine, Washington, D.C.].  And I said, oh, this isn't going to work.  You see, in psychiatry, people used to warehouse people back then.  If you're crazy, you could be locked up for thirty, forty years, now they just let people out, give 'em some medicine, they're all out on the street.  But you had to interview them every six months to find out, you know, what's your name, do you know where you are, who's the president, no, Harry Truman [President Harry S. Truman] is not the president; et cetera.  And I was interviewing this ninety-six year old woman, and, and she was, you know, answering my questions, and then she asked me, she says, "What does this mean, young doctor?  How does, how does a quiet cat catch a lot of mice?"  I said, "Well, what that means is--," I said (scratches head), "wait a minute, I'm doing--I'm asking these questions."  (Laughter) And she said, "That's right, scratch your head because you're confused, and if you keep coming out here, you're gonna be out with the rest of these crazy people.  I'm just old and don't have a place to go."  I said, "Okay, I accept that," (laughter) I accepted her advice.  And I said, no, I can't go into that. The woman's right (laughter).  So I decided to go into orthopedic surgery.  I decided to move from the human psyche, which you couldn't see, to a broken bone, which you could see, and you see, when you went into the orthopedic  surgery operating room, it's just like my father's shop: hammers, saws, chisel, I know how to use all this stuff (laughter), I could do this.  And so, I decided to go into surgery, and for that reason, so surgery was a year, general surgery, and three years of orthopedics.  So I did a year general surgery, and year of orthopedics.  And then I found out: I don't like getting up in the middle of the night (laughter) to operate on people.  And see, my brother [Lucius Earles, III] was doing dermatology the same time I was doing orthopedic surgery.  So anyway, sending me dermatology journals, rather than orthopedic journals--computer (unclear)--and I'm reading this stuff, it's kind of interesting.  And, so I'm on call, and you know just as you put your head down, you're gonna get some sleep, 'cause you know they're gonna call you.  And you get about two inches above the pillow, that's when the phone rings; I don't know how the operators knew that you're just about to hit that pillow.  "Dr. Earles [HistoryMaker Dr. Rene Martin Earles], you have an open and fractured femur in the emergency room," and that meant you were going to be up the next few hours, maybe all night, and that's when I said, oh, maybe my brother was smarter than I thought (laughter) he's at home asleep.  So, I'm reading this stuff, and I started noticing skin, I didn't like--I liked orthopedics, but the head wouldn't let us operate, he thought we were Boy Scouts, he wouldn't let us do those things that we were trained to do, so I just got out of that.
Speaker 1: So now, you did your residency at which hospital?
Speaker 2: That was at Howard [Freedmen's Hospital; Howard University Hospital, Washington, D.C.], and D.C. General Hospital [District of Columbia General Hospital, Washington, D.C.] that I did orthopedics and general surgery.
Speaker 1: General surgery.
Speaker 2: So, two mon- so I did a year of general surgery and a year of orthopedics.  So two more years of orthopedics out of it, (gesture) cracking bones, you see.
Speaker 1: So now--
Speaker 2: So, by that time, you know, and it was good you see, because I wanted to be like my brother and here we were, he was a dermatologist, and he was also getting a full night's sleep (laughter).
Story_ID: 612035
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So now we're in, let me see, what year, we're in 1969 after you finish your second residency, is that right?
Speaker 2: Sixty-nine [1969], yeah.  I guess that was--
Speaker 1: So you go into the [U.S.] Navy the next year?
Speaker 2: --sixty-seven [1967]--no, I didn't go to the Navy that next year, I went to, I worked in--as a matter of fact, my, my, first wife Barbara [ph.], suggested to me that, she says--because I wasn't, you know, the guy wouldn't let us operate, the head of the department wouldn't let us operate in orthopedics to the extent that we wanted to, because in general surgery, we did a lot of surgery.  So I--here he was very pompous, we had to observe him, and Barbara said, "You don't have to stay there if you don't want to."  You know, and the little light bulb (gesture) (laughter).  I--she says, "You're a doctor, you have a license to practice."  I said oh, my god, so I did, and I left, and I became a jail physician.  I worked at Lorton Reformatory [Lorton, Virginia], and I also worked in the emergency room, and I don't know, maybe I did those for a year.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And tell me, when did you get married?
Speaker 2: Must have been as an intern, which was somewhere, finished in--must've been '68 [1968], something like that.
Speaker 1: So, you did a year at Lorton and the emergency room--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, Lorton.
Speaker 1: And then--okay.
Speaker 2: Lorton Reform- I don't know, did you see that movie about Petey Greene, it was, I know it was 'Talk to Me,' it was about a person who was in Lorton Reformatory and came out and became a disc jockey, or a talk show host and?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: So that--
Speaker 1: 'Speak to Me' was the name [sic.]--
Speaker 2: 'Speak to Me.'
Speaker 1: --was the name of the movie.
Speaker 2: Right.  'Speak to Me,' and it turns out, see, the guy who was the radio station manager Dewey Hughes lived a couple of blocks from me.  And his brother, who he was visiting in jail, was a year behind me in Coolidge High School [Calvin Coolidge High School; Calvin Coolidge Senior High School, Washington, D.C.] (laughter).  And so I ended up going to Lorton Reformatory, to working at Lorton Reformatory, and seeing Sam [ph.], the fellow who Dewey was visiting during the opening scenes, so it, so it was--
Story_ID: 612036
Speaker 1: Okay, so after that year is when you joined the [U.S.] Navy?  Now, this is the Vietnam era [Vietnam War], is that right?
Speaker 2: Vietnam era.  Well what happened was that, if you were gonna do your residency, they could draft you right out of middle of your re- if you were doing a four year residency, and they said, "Oh, we need a doctor, we need some doctors," then they could take you right out in the middle of it.  In order to guarantee that they would allow you finish it, then if you joined, then you would go in as a specialist, and they allow you, they say, "We won't interrupt your training."  So as a consequence, I joined because I was going to go there as an orthopedic surgeon.
Speaker 1: Where were you stationed?
Speaker 2: Seattle, Washington.  But interestingly, the emergency room, when I was at Lorton [Lorton Reformatory, Lorton, Virginia] I worked, and then I worked in the emergency room in Silver Spring, Maryland, and I was just gonna join the emergency room group there because I liked it.  And interestingly, about two weeks after--well the Navy called me, said, no, you're not going to be doing that; you're coming here.  And about two weeks after I think, maybe in my--after I left, that was when Governor Wallace [George Wallace] got shot.  And where did they take him?  Taking him to the emergency room where I used to work right there, and I just thought about that, can you imagine what that would have been like, if I had been on?  And I could have came.  But be that as it may, yes, I went to the Navy, in Seattle, and I was there for two years.  And at that time, I was--spent about, oh, almost that whole time on, one day a week going to the University of Washington's dermatology department and I really learned what a dermatologist did and I said, oh, this'll work for me.
Speaker 1: And who were the doctors of influence there at Washington [University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, Washington]--in Washington?
Speaker 2: Oh, the head of the department was Dr. Odland, George Odland, O-D-L-A-N-D [George F. Odland], or I wanna say L-U-N-D.  So he was the head of the department, and interestingly, and I called and I told him who I was, because the Navy had a policy of letting you go half day a week for continuing education, and I called and Dr. Odland answered, and somehow, they put him through to me, I said, "You know, I'd like to attend your dermatology--is that possible?"  He said, "Are you black?"  And I said, "Well, yes," (laughter).  And he said, "Great!"  He says, "Oh, I'm happy about that," he said, "I could kind of tell, I wasn't sure."  And he said, but he said, "My residents don't have much exposure to black doctors, so I'm really pleased," and, and he was sincere, and so, I did.  And I spent a year and a half there.
Speaker 1: And, and, this is true about dermatology, is that not right?  That there are still today aren't very many who specialize, well, they specialize in different things, but it seems that it's not easy to find a good dermatologist who specializes in African American--
Speaker 2: Well, that's true.  I think that's, I think that can be said to be true.
Story_ID: 612037
Speaker 1: Tell me what happens next, you are in the [U.S.] Navy for two years?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was in the Navy for two years.
Speaker 1: And what happens next?
Speaker 2: And I came to Chicago [Illinois], Dr. Odland [George F. Odland] said, "Well, where would you like to do your residency?  You wanna stay here?"  And I said, "Well, no I wanna go to Chicago."  "Why would you wanna go there?"  And so, at that time my brother [Lucius Earles, III] and I had--we'd been communicating and he had come to Chicago to take someone's practice here, Dr. Wallace, T.K. Wallace [Theodore K. Lawless], he was just maybe the biggest dermatologist in the country.  And I wasn't sure whether or not I--.  And so we were talking and considering practicing together, and I wasn't sure we got on well enough to do that, so I said, I'd come and do my residency in Chicago, and I'll find out.  And I found out we didn't, we both found that out, we tried it twice; didn't work out.  But, so I came to here and I did my residency at Rush [Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, Illinois].  And there wasn't any matching system then, for residencies, you had to apply, you applied directly to the department, and whoever was in head of the department, or whatever committee they had made the decision, but there's some national something now, but it wasn't that way back then.  In fact, it was quite easy for me, because it was a brand new program, it was only one person in training in the program, and the person, George Odland, was a classmate of, at Harvard [Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts], a guy, who was running--whom came from the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois] to Rush to start the program.  So it was just, oh, I got this great kid.  So that's all there was.
Speaker 1: And you finished your residency in what year?
Speaker 2: Seventy-five [1975]--'72 [1972] to '75 [1975].
Speaker 1: And is that when you opened your practice?
Speaker 2: Yes, I worked at a medical clinic for a couple of years, and I would, oh I opened it up and I opened up an office after maybe a year for a co- and gradually built my practice up.
Story_ID: 612038
Speaker 1: So, where was your first office open, what part of Chicago [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: 2600 South Michigan Avenue, which was--and I was there for maybe fifteen years, and now my office is 2950, I'm all of four blocks away, South Michigan as well.
Speaker 1: So tell me what it was like when you first opened your practice and your patients, because now, I understand you have so many patients, how many patients have you seen over this--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: --these years of being in practice?  I understand it's one of the largest dermatology offices, and you've seen--so how many patients have you seen so far?
Speaker 2: Now you know I don't know.
Speaker 1: About?
Speaker 2: I, you know, I think we have about twenty thousand charts, but I don't know, I mean, people--
Speaker 1: But it's fair to say that it's one of the best dermatology offices, practices, is that not right?
Speaker 2: You know, I don't know whether dermatologists know that kind of information (laughter), you know, I really don't.  I don't really know that kind of thing.  I know I had a--now I was really busy in Gary [Indiana].  I had an office in Gary once, and I was extremely well organized over there for some reason or another.
Speaker 1: What year was Gary?
Speaker 2: I was there--1981.
Speaker 1: So you had two offices going?
Speaker 2: I had two offices and I'd go over there two days a week, and after about a year and a half, two years, I was seeing about a hundred patients a day, two days, two days a week.  So it was really busy and I was using some of, I think were some pretty sophisticated methods back then, of streamlining things, and making 'em move smoothly.
Story_ID: 612039
Speaker 1: Nineteen ninety-five [1995] you opened your office [in Chicago, Illinois], your practice--
Speaker 2: Seventy-five [1975].
Speaker 1: Nine- I'm sorry, '75 [1975], and then in '76 [1976], what gets you involved in hair transplants?
Speaker 2: Well, what got me involved in hair transplants, was that I think I heard the word (laughter).  Somebody mentioned hair transplants, I said, "What, what?"  And somehow that just grabbed my imagin- I mean, you can do that?  And once I heard it, I wanted to do it.  And I'm s- I got involved in doing it, so when I finished--now, I heard about it before I--my residency [at Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, Illinois] was up, and they didn't offer that type of training during the residency, so when I finished, then I pursued it with some vigor.  And then I said, ah, I'll give myself about ten years, I'll become the expert in hair transplants in black people. People will fly all over the world to see me, I'll be in Ebony magazine, and dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah.  So, ten years later, I was an expert, and people were flying all over and I was in Ebony magazine back in--
Speaker 1: Just what you said would happen did happen.  But tell me about the procedure, it was first done because you have what's called the Earle flaps [sic. Earles flap], but it was a Juri flap (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, well, you see there were two, there were two--there was a plastic surgeon whose name is Jose Juri, J-U-R-I, he's in, I think, in Argentina, and his brother, Carlos [ph.] I think.  One was a (unclear)--I mean one is a plastic surgeon, and one was a dermatologist, and they created this, this piece of surgery I think a strip of hair from the side, and you can rotate it around, and put it on the front, and so it gives you a strip of hair around here.  It was a fairly complicated procedure.  And I had a friend of mine who was in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], who was getting a hair transplant from a doctor in California, Newport Beach, Constantine Sparkle [ph.] was his name, who had been down to Argentina to learn this flap, amongst some other things.  Now he had went and invented something called the scalp reduction, where you just cut out the bone there, your scalp, you throw it away, and pull the scalp together (gesture) like that.  And you may do that serially (gesture); you may start off suppose this is--with this much bone (unclear), you cut out once, you got that much, you cut out again, that much, cut out again, you see, until it's gone--if the scalp will, you know, allow you to do that.  And so, I would fly out with Harold Pierce [Harold E. Pierce], who's his name, in Philadelphia to, to see Dr. Sparkle do this procedure.  And so when I had an opportunity, I did it on people, started off on my brother in law (laughter).  And so I did that, and then I went out there one time and he was doing this, this Juri flap.  I said, oh my god, not in my office will I do that (laughter), and I ended up doing it.  And then, I addressed the problem of African American women who had their hair loss here (gesture) where people have and it's sort of--just sort of reverse Juri flap that works, that just simply hadn't been done.  Nobody had considered doing it because people said, "Eh, there's nothing you can do about that," so.
Speaker 1: So, the Earle flap that you created is for women?
Speaker 2: Yeah, or anybody who has hair loss here (gesture).  Who has hair loss here?  African American women had the hair loss thing, so it's a flap of hair from here (gesture), and you lift it up, see, it's like this, you lift it up, and it goes there (gesture).  So you could get full thickness of hair here, but you had to have some thickness of the hair here.  If you have hair loss here, there's nothing to move, but you can take that from there, and put it in there, and it just changes the whole thing.
Story_ID: 612040
Speaker 1: And was this something that you did often in your office, or was it just a special thing (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, I used to do it, I used to do it quite a bit, quite a lot.  And one thing about hair transplants is that in order to do it you have to almost restrict your other practice in order to do it.  You have to kind of promote it, say, well I'm not going to do this other stuff because you have to have a team of people and with the patients and the clientele and the like.  And something happened in '81 [1981], that's when it was, which was difficult at that time, that type of organization for me was, was, difficult.  And in 1981 a friend of mine, his father--Randy Morgan [Randall C. Morgan], was an orthopedic surgeon in Gary [Indiana] who was at Howard a year or two behind me in medical school [Howard University College of Medicine, Washington, D.C.].  And Randy's father, Mr. Morgan [Randall Morgan, Sr.], needed, he'd been trying to get me to come over to Gary to practice dermatology, and he says, "Yeah, I got an offer that you can't refuse."  And a woman had been practicing there, and she had left and so she had everything there, and all they needed was a doctor, and I went over there, and then I started practicing.  Well, as I said, I was seeing a lot of patients, so that diminished my capability of doing these hair transplants, and that practice got me involved in first mixing and then creating medicines.  And then once I got into that, I really didn't have time to do any of the other--the hair transplants.  I did it for a while, but it was a little difficult.  I still do 'em sometimes but.
Story_ID: 612041
Speaker 1: You were gonna talk about the mixing of the medicines for your hair care line [Dr. Earles] I believe, tell me about that.
Speaker 2: Yeah, what would happen was that I've always been a mixer of things and so--which is what goes on in dermatology, 'cause dermatologists have been mixing things for probably since the profession started.  And so, I had always been very curious about mixing things and a lot of the prescriptions that I wrote were compounds.  A dermatologist's only specialty in medicine when you can say take a little of this, pinch of that, quarter teaspoon of this, oh, add, and an eighth of a teaspoon of that, and mix it up and put it on.  I mean you can't be a cardiologist and say take half of this pill and then a piece of that one (laughter).  And so, as a result, now I got a lot of experience in that, seeing what would work and what wouldn't.  And you see, you can do it, and as long as these are approved substances, you can put it on people.  You see, that would be called experimentation, it's something else, but it's sort of like the art of medicine in dermatology.  Now, there was one pharmacy in the City of Gary [Indiana] who could mix things, and he was slow, he was arrogant, and he was expensive, and people would take their prescriptions to him and he'd say, "Well, it's gonna be a week, and it's going to cost you, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah."  "Oh my god, I need that stuff now," and they would complain to him, and then he would, he would say, he would reach in, or, "Here, take this back and take it somewhere else."  And they would take the prescription and as they would turn to leave, he would say, "But you'll be back."  And by god, they had to come back because he was the only one in Northwest Indiana that knew how to do that, they'd come back with their tail between their legs.  They complained to me so bitterly, that I started, I said, oh, let me see, let me see.  I had a major in (laughter) biology and chemistry, another major in pharmacology, oh, it's nothing to this.  And I started mixing things and preparing them.  And that led from--and then, in order to cut costs, then I said, oh, there's a 4 percent thing of this, why don't you just get thing and you know, the raw materials, and I started getting the raw materials, and I could weigh down the cost, but it also gave me a vehicle for creating things, and so that's how I got to creating different products.
Story_ID: 612042
Speaker 1: And tell me, what were some of the things that the [Dr. Earles] products were for?
Speaker 2: Oh--
Speaker 1: What did, what did they treat?
Speaker 2: Well, they treat problems primarily that African Americans have.  And basically we have (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Like?
Speaker 2: I treat dandruff, one is for treatment of dandruff, one is for treating--treatment of acne, and the other is for razor bumps, if you will.  I did make a thigh cream at one time, which was--it worked I think, very well, people would tell me--I can remember one woman, saying--.  And I stopped making it, because there was some question as to whether or not, does this stuff really work?  But, I had any number of people, and I think I'm going to start making it again (laughter) thigh cream, and the cream for razor bumps, I think I mentioned that; so those are the proud- products.
Speaker 1: So, you have to apply for a patent for these types of things?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: No?
Speaker 2: There are some things that are--you can get a patent for, and I have a patent for my scalp medicine and I'm in the process of initiating the application for a patent for two others.  But what happens is, you don't have to apply for a patent. A patent is something that the government awards you if the product that you've created is unique, new, hasn't been out here before, and is what's called non-obvious to a practitioner of the art.  In other words, it shouldn't be something that say, oh, well anybody can see that you do the--add this or that and you'll get that; one and two is three.  So it has to be non-obvious.  And if it meets those criteria, then they will award you a patent for your unique preparation that says nobody else can manufacture this, you see.
Speaker 1: So your scalp--and that's for what condition for your scalp?
Speaker 2: That's for dandruff.
Speaker 1: That's the--?  Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, you say I found a way to kind of--you know, oil and water don't mix, I found a way to add, to mix oil and water that was--.  And I also found a way to change the character of the mixture, because it has elemental raw materials, sulfur in it, and to change it, it's consistency and all, so and the way it smells, you see, it's all those things helped in awarding me a patent for that.
Story_ID: 612043
Speaker 1: Now, you've written a number of articles and have presented, and your dream came true to be in Ebony and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, it did, it did (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) different magazines.  Tell me, tell me a little about any or all of those things.
Speaker 2: Well, you know that Ebony, I was very--when I moved to Chicago [Illinois], and actually the same, same wife, who said, "Ah, you don't have to do that," (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Was that Barbara [ph.]?
Speaker 2: Barbara, Barbara became a friend with Barbara DeLeon [ph.], who was married to Bob DeLeon [Robert DeLeon], and Bob was a managing editor of Jet magazine, and so, Bob and I became friends.  I saw Barbara the other day.  And just as--so I got to meet the Johnsons very early in the game, and they wanted--after--at some point, they wanted to do something on hair transplants, and so they called me up, and that's how that happened. And I would, you know, just joke with Mr. Johnson [HistoryMaker John H. Johnson], he would say, "Doctor," (gesture), "are you gonna do something for me?"  But he didn't (laughter).  But he was a fellow who worked for him, he told me he was willing to pay for it, "Why don't you try that, I'll pay for it, we'll see how it looks," (laughter).
Speaker 1: Did that ever happen?
Speaker 2: That never happened, so I didn't get to do that--I didn't get to do it, but (laughter).
Story_ID: 612044
Speaker 1: Now your expertise was also used for Fashion Fair [Fashion Fair cosmetics] and for Soft Sheen [Soft Sheen Products, Inc.].  Tell me about that.
Speaker 2: Well, actually I would test Fashion Fair's products for them, in regard to irritants, and comonotonicity, and in general, tolerance, and so, that was--I was a test--those were just sort of routine tests, tests products have to be in order to be dermatologist tested.  And so those were not difficult tests or anything, but they were important and necessary, you know, for any products to be of high quality, and they worked well.
Speaker 1: And what about Soft Sheen, what did you do for them?
Speaker 2: Well, at Soft Sheen, they wanted me to create a product for the trust--to test for, for perm pot- for the potential damage for perms.  And--
Speaker 1: When you say perms, you mean relaxers, right?
Speaker 2: Relaxers, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so, so I came up with three projects, and it was off of the--really just sort of the top my head, I came up with three different ideas, and actually they liked them, and it was interested in the most sophisticated and most expensive one, and he says, "Well, is--you got anything else?  We'd like to go with this one. Is there anything else that you'd think I should recommend--(unclear) you'd recommend?"  I said, "You know, these are things that I have thought about, I haven't checked anything at all."  Said, "Could be something else out here like that, I don't know, and so, I'd advise you to check," (laughter).   And he did check and it was interesting that somebody had just come out with almost the exact thing, and they were able to do that, but I stayed in, in contact with them about a number of other things, so.
Story_ID: 612045
Speaker 1: Did you want to talk about maybe some of the articles that you published that, you know, you feel were--well, of course you felt all of them were important, but one that might have been dear to you?
Speaker 2: Well, I think I really liked the hair transplants in African American women article ['Surgical Correction of Traumatic Alopecia Marginalis or Traction Alopecia in Black Women,' Rene Martin Earles]. It was the you know first article that was ever published about hair transplants in African American women, and it was a concept and an idea that you know, that I came up with, so I enjoyed doing that, and I also enjoyed the dramatic results that it got, so.
Speaker 1: You say the dramatic--oh, as far as--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --the results, results of the transplant (Simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah, it just, yeah, it just, oh yeah, it just changes the way women's hair looks a great deal.
Story_ID: 612046
Speaker 1: As a dermatologist, I know that you probably have treated people for keloids as well, is that black--a condition in blacks mostly, you know the scarring and (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.  Primarily, although some whites get keloids, and interestingly, interesting that you should ask that, because I'm--I just operated on a man with a huge keloid, and it was under here like this (gesture).  And it was just, I mean, it was that big, and sticking out that much, and I, I, saw him this morning, did it in May, and he looks fantastic.  And I think, I've developed a method for treating keloids that--puts--because I've done some others, and I--if his works out well, and I think it will, and some of the other, other cases that I've done, I think I have a new way of addressing keloids.  And if his does I'll just--with his permission, I'll send the pictures out and do some more, and I'd like to do a book on keloids, that's, that's a project.
Speaker 1: So, so, is that a condition that is preventable or not?
Speaker 2: One would have a high--have to have a--it could be--a high index of suspicion, first of all, that you're gonna get keloids.  Of course that person has other keloids, you can presume that you're gonna get keloids with injury.  But it might well be the case, and it should be observed early.  You see, suppose you have surgery, and you develop a keloid, well it doesn't come overnight, so some heightened awareness, say, oh, this thing is developing a keloid, and we need to do X,Y,Z; that type of awareness I don't think exists for most surgeons, for most surgery.  Now, if a dermatologist does surgery, and he's--you know we, most dermatologists are aware, oh, this thing's trying to get to be a keloid, I'd better do something.  But plast- most surgeons figure their work is in the surgery, not how this looks at the end.  You're gonna do a tummy tuck, okay, it's a tummy tuck, you got rid of that extra, whatever that extra was, you see, yeah.
Speaker 1: I see.  So, what's next for, for you, Dr. Earles [HistoryMaker Dr. Rene Martin Earles]?
Speaker 2: What's next?  Keloids are next.
Speaker 1: Keloids?  Okay.
Speaker 2: Keloids, keloids are next for me and I think that'll be--yeah, because there're some keloids, which are so large, that--.  For instance, I had one patient, (gesture) he had this huge keloid in the back, well, you know, you can't have enough skin to cover it, so what we do is, we use what's called a tissue expander, which is a balloon.  And you make some space, slide a balloon under the scalp and then you pump it up and you get a big, head like that (gesture).  So when you pump the balloon up on a weekly basis then what happens is the tissue grows, just like when you get pregnant?  Well, that's not just stretched skin, it's also new skin.  And so you can--wherever the keloid is, where it's in the head, or elsewhere, then you can pump it up, then you can cut this out, and can just almost like, pull the shade, you see, close that, so depending where the keloid is.  And then if we follow the other measures that I'm developing I think we can get rid of keloids and keep them from coming back and hence give people who have keloids a lot of relief, yeah.
Story_ID: 612047
Speaker 1: What about your product line [Dr. Earles]?  Do you still develop your product?  I understand that your son [Robert Earles] also graduated from Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And is he working for you now?
Speaker 2: Oh yes, he's, he's the director of, of our product division, and he just called me today, he was having a meeting at Walgreens [Walgreens Company].
Speaker 1: So this is a whole line of--personal care line, is that right?  What does it include?
Speaker 2: Well, it includes those products that I mentioned to you before, for the treatment of dandruff, and a treatment for acne, which there are three products, so that's an acne kit, and the treatment of dandruff has two products and include the shampoo that I developed, and then we have a razor bump cream, and I'm--I think I'm going to add the thigh cream to it.  I also have a product that I've developed for eczema, so--
Speaker 1: So you've already developed the eczema--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I have.
Speaker 1: --product?  Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 612048
Speaker 1: Now, you talked about one son, do you have any other children?
Speaker 2: I have a daughter.
Speaker 1: And--well, tell us the name of your son and daughter.
Speaker 2: Well, my son is Robert [Robert Earles] and my daughter is Andrea [Andrea Earles].
Speaker 1: And they are--are they children of Barbara [ph.]?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: No.  Okay.
Speaker 2: No, they're children of Eve [Eve Evans Earles] (laughter).
Speaker 1: Eve?  Well, we talked about Barbara, but we never talked about Eve, when did you marry Eve?
Speaker 2: Oh, I married Eve--oh, my god, I'm sorry.
Speaker 1: I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) When did we get married?  God, I don't know, was that '81 [1981], '80 [1980]?  I'm not--see, I'm not good with numbers (laughter).  Maybe seventy-something, I don't know.  Let me see, wait a minute, Bobby was born in--oh, I married her even in seventy-something.  No, no, no, Bobby was born in '79 [1979], and so that would have been about '77 [1977] that I--that Eve and I got married.
Speaker 1: And your daughter, what does she do?
Speaker 2: My daughter is a thespian, she majored in theater here at Columbia [Columbia College Chicago, Chicago, Illinois], she was at Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] briefly, and it wasn't the best place for her, so she majored in theater at Columbia, she's a very artistic child; she sings, she paints, she designs, stuff, furniture, she's very creative.  And so after she finished at Columbia, I said, "Oh, you're gonna audition for some plays or things?"  She says, "Ah, I think I want to work in the business," (laughter), "right now, I think that's what I want to do, Dad."  Which was good, because Bobby had hit a kind of rough point, and she came in and she (gesture) brought energy, and ideas, and, and gave an infusion of what was needed, at the time it was needed.  So, so I'm very fortunate, in that my kids are right across the hall. I see them every day, several times a day, and we've had the opportunity to work together and to be together in a way that most adults don't get to do with their children.  And once they finish college, you see, 'cause usually they're just gone; you know one's in Atlanta [Georgia] (laughter), and one's in Minneapolis [Minnesota], you see.  So I count myself as being very fortunate that not only am I working with them, but we're having some success as well, yeah.
Story_ID: 612049
Speaker 1: When you look back over your life, is there anything that you would change, or anything that you regret?
Speaker 2: Well, let's see, you know you have to go through what you go through to get where you are (laughter).  So, and you know what you know when you know it (laughter).  So, I would--I wish, if you will, that I had been more outgoing, less fearful, but if you're more outgoing that means you're less introspective, probably.  So if I had been more outgoing I probably wouldn't have done the things that I do or did, or have done.  And probably that's the way our minds work.  Now, I would have (unclear) just, just between you and me (laughter), I guess it was only a month ago, or six weeks ago that I saw somebody for my attention deficit disorder.  Now, all my life, I'd been going the wrong places, the wrong time, can't find keys, getting locked out, can't find anything, and I just accepted it as just part of me being--I wonder how people can keep up with me you see (laughter)?  And how they get things done in an organized way, and how do you know that meeting was when--?  So, I've been very fortunate I've been in the sort of environment where people at the office know, they kind of keep up with things for me, and I'm being married, you know, and pointed in the right direction.  However, if I had known that, then I think, and then if some treatment had been, if I had had some treatment, then I think that I would have been a more productive person.
Story_ID: 612050
Speaker 1: What would you like your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: Oh, I don't know, here lies Earles [HistoryMaker Dr. Rene Martin Earles] (laughter).
Speaker 1: Well what do you want people to remember you for?
Speaker 2: My poetry (laughter).  My poetry, you see, I'm writing a book of poetry now.
Speaker 1: You didn't tell me you were a poet.
Speaker 2: I'm writing a book of poetry and--
Speaker 1: You wanna give us a poem?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was--.  Here's a social commentary, and for the sake of--since we're on this, I call it 'Bull Spit' [ph.], and I did this in the high school.  And so, and I talk about when we were children and we visited my father's [Lucius Earles, Jr.] boyhood farm where he grew up, our grandfather's, grandparents' [Sallie Earles and Lucius Earles, Sr.] farm, there were a lot of interesting animals.  The most interesting was the bull and he was in a pen, you see, and he would--we'd run over and we'd get close, and the bull would run, and we'd run back from the pen.  And my brother [Lucius Earles, III] who was older, he would (gesture), he would put his hand in there, oh, it scared us to death.  And so, once when the bull came he barely got his hand--the bull was frothing at the mouth, he got some spit on him and he got a rash on him and so, from henceforth, our saying, what are we doing?  I'm gonna get bull spit on you, you see?  And so, that's the name of my poem, it's--rhymes with something else about the bull, but, so, and it goes like this--and this is back when I was rapper Doc, you see (laughter).  So it goes like this, it's been--and I don't know how many years it's been now--"I'll just say this: it's been 140 years since the Emancipation Proclamation, and despite all the misery and pain, the black man is faced with slavery again.  The slavery that I speak of is of a different kind, the shackles are no longer on his ankles, but securely on his mind.  The thing that brings me most to tears, is that my brothers have volunteered, yes, they volunteered to put their neck back into the yolk.  The slave master deceiver goes by the name of coke, and his daughter the cruel wench who rides our poor brothers back, she tenaciously holds on, won't let go and goes by the name of crack.  Oh, I never thought I'd see the day that to be a slave, a man would pay, our forefathers who fought for and died for our liberty.  What's the fortune of that they cannot see?  But now is not the time for pity or tears, time is short; we don't have years.  But who amongst us will stand the test, and lead us out of this awful mess?  I, rapper Doc," (laughter), "I will be the way through rhyme, rhythm and reason, and I'll point to a better day.  I'll start right now, I'm prepared to do my bit, but I demand the truth, and I don't want no bull spit."
Story_ID: 612051
Speaker 1: And then I talk about: "So listen little brother, I understand you like the streets, where the hidden dangers are everywhere that you had no chance to beat.  Sure, you can make some quick, big Benjamins dealing in those streets, and other people's misery feeding, gouging them so deep.  And then, let's see it goes something like: dah, dah, tah, dah, tah, dah, tah, tah, tah.  And the only cover you're gonna get is the cover of a sheet, so up to your room, don't give me that look; the only crack I wanna see is the opening of a book.  Your mom and dad, we love you, and we know you're oh, so sweet, and we will not let you be a victim of the street.  And listen little girl with that tight, tight, spandex on, show your body off, okay, but don't let it get shopped on, because you see, the truth of it in the 2000s boys and girls are doing it; but put that condom on 'cause you don't want no bull spit.  AIDS [acquired immunodeficiency syndrome], babies in other forms, STD [sexually transmitted disease], mothers too young, grandmothers soon to be, welfare lines, food pick up times, got to get the WIC [Women, Infants, and Children].  Times get bad, no sign of dad, got to pull a trick.  Oh, the very worse diss for the worst mental health is the diss you get when you do it to yourself.  Please girls, don't do it to yourself.  And listen all you parents, if you're not on the job, I ought to tell you: you're a terrible slob.  Because if you're not doing time, you've got the time to give the lessons to your children, on how they should live.  And plenty of love, understanding and affection, and always pointed in the right direction, so if the finger," (points), "points to you, then on your job you get.  'Cause I'm telling you the truth, and I don't want no bull spit.  A hundred forty some years and we're still not free, don't you understand my children?  Education is the key."
Speaker 2: That was great.
Speaker 1: Thank you.
Speaker 2: And I think that would answer my final question that was going to say, what would you say to the future generations, and I think that was an appropriate mess- message.
Speaker 1: Great.
Speaker 2: So, I'd like to thank you for taking the time to share your story with us, for the future generations.
Story_ID: 612052
Speaker 1: Is there anything that we might have missed that you want to talk about before we end?
Speaker 2: No, I guess not, unless you have a CD [compact disc] player, I'll let you hear my record.  I did make a record, but I was really like (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What was the name of it?
Speaker 2: Well, I wrote one--
Speaker 1: Oh, you wrote one?
Speaker 2: --it's called, it's called 'Oh Baby' (laughter).  First line goes--I made it I was--I wrote this song with this woman and we recorded it, and it goes: "Oh baby, oh baby, I need you here, and me so deep inside, oh baby, oh baby, come back to me, forget your foolish pride," et cetera (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Okay.  All right, well I want to thank you so much for taking the time to share your story, for The HistoryMakers and for the future generations (simultaneous).
