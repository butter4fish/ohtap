Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: Seafood is my favorite food. If you live in Maryland, you have to be a seafood eater, and I eat a lot of crabs, but I like all kinds of seafood.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Black.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I own a black BMW with black interior, black on black in black.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) okay.  Now, do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Well, no I--I like the seasons, I have a second home in Orlando, Florida and it is--it is my second home simply because you don't get the seasons there. I love to see the fall, the changing of the leaves. My property here in Owings Mills [Maryland] is surrounded not by wooden fence but by a--a bush line, and the bushes are called burning bushes because in the Fall they turn completely blood red.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Anywhere I can play golf.
Speaker 1: All right, the last question is, do you have a favorite phrase or saying?

Story_ID: 15249
Speaker 1: Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: My mother's name at birth was DeSylvia, D-E capital S-Y-L-V-I-A Virginia, common spelling, Chase.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Ah, you're testing me.  Mother--my mother was born--interestingly my mother's date of birth on her birth record is April 4, 1923, but she was actually born April 1, 1923.  We know this for a couple of reasons.  One, April 1, 1923 was a Sunday, and my mother was born on that Sunday, and the--we also knew it because we know that the--the women who came around to record the occurrence of her birth, the midwife, was working the circuit and didn't get back into the hospital to file the records until much later and apparently made a mistake with the date.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: April 1, 1923 is my mother's date of birth.
Speaker 1: Okay, and where was she born?
Speaker 2: She was born in Calvert County, Maryland.  C-A-L-V-E-R-T.
Speaker 1: Okay, named after Lord Calvert I think, right?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) After the first Lord Calvert [George Calvert], yes, the founders of Baltimore.  It's a southern Maryland county, tobacco growing, agricultural county.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what--what--how much do you know about the ancestors on your mother's side?  How far back can you trace your mother's ancestors?
Speaker 2: I don't know a lot about the ancestors on my mother's side.  My mother's father--his name is William Howe. His father, whose name I do not recall, but I do recall the fact that his father arrived in this country from Guam, and I have a picture of him somewhere.  I have to pull it out for you. Well, when you see the picture, he looks just like any other brother, and we think that he, in fact, was a Buffalo Soldier who spent time in the Philippines and worked his way through Guam and back into the United States.
Speaker 1: That's interesting, yeah, that's yeah, that's a likely scenario 'cause they did send them right from--right to the Philippines and you know from here.
Speaker 2: Yeah, (simultaneously) on my mother's--I should say also that my mother's mother--I should--not--my-my grandmother, Elizabeth Howe, was also born in Calvert County and her mother, had a relationship with a a white Irishman named O'Leary, and O'Leary is the, the blood line in my family that has produced this very fair complexion among many of me--my siblings and other relatives.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right, so this relationship, was this like--?
Speaker 2: This was an out-of-marriage relationship that my great-grandmother on my mother's side had with a white man named O'Leary in Calvert County, Maryland.
Speaker 1: This would be in the late 1800s [1800s], I guess?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) yeah, it would have been in the late 1800s [1800s].
Speaker 1: Post slavery, but--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, my grandmother was in fact born in in 1890--1895.  So it would have been in in the mid-to-late 1800s.
Speaker 1: Okay, so great-grandmother would be 1870 or so--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --maybe?  Okay.  All right, are there any stories from that side of the family that are passed down about any--any of the people that are--you just mentioned?
Speaker 2: (Laughter), No, but there are--there is one story about my Uncle Herbert, who, was in fact not my Uncle Herbert, but my great uncle.  My mother's Uncle Herbert. He owned a movie theater in Calvert county, the story goes, at a time when movie theaters were segregated.  And Uncle Herbert being a person of fairly light complexion, decided that the best opportunity to succeed as a movie theater operator was to run his theater like white folks ran their theater.  And, so the colored sat in the balcony and the white folks sat on the first floor of Uncle Herbert's theater.
Speaker 1: So, he operated a segregated movie house?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) That's the story to my great shame.
Speaker 1: It's interesting though that he would run a movie house in those days.  I mean this is like,--so this is your mother's great uncle?
Speaker 2: It would be my mother's uncle.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Your mother's uncle, okay,  right.
Speaker 2: I remember as a kid, traveling this--to Calvert County, Maryland, and again it's in the southern part of the state along the Chesapeake Bay, and going to the theater which was closed at the time.  This would have been in the early 1950s.  We would have visits to that area during the summer.  Occasionally, we'd go--all pile into a car and travel--travel down and they would take us off and let us play around the old theater house, it was boarded up, except there were--there were a set of stairs on the outside that went up to the projection booth, and I remember going up one day and picking up some old tickets--a--a--a big collection of tickets there and just looking at the theater, but didn't know much about the history until much later, when family members--it was a whispered kind of thing actually.  A--a--no one took great pleasure in talking about it, but eventually as I got older, a family member shared the story with me which I assumed to be true.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what was your great-grandfather who was possibly a Buffalo Soldier--what was his name?
Speaker 2: His name was Howe too, and I'll have to get you his first name.  I don't recall his first name.
Speaker 1: All right.  Okay.
Speaker 2: H-O-W-E.
Story_ID: 15250
Speaker 1: Did your mother [DeSylvia Virginia Wickham, nee Chase] talk about growing up in--tell any stories about growing up in the--?
Speaker 2: Well, my mother didn't live long enough to tell me any stories.  My mother died in 1953 in December, very tragically.  She was murdered by my father [John Trevillian Wickham] who then committed suicide.  It was a murder-suicide in December of 1953.  I was only eight at the time so don't have very many memories of them at all, I remember that my father used to take me to to a bar, actually, in a section of town called Westport just outside of Cherry Hill [Baltimore, Maryland neighborhoods] and he would leave us in the car--me and my siblings and he'd go in and I assume have a drink or two and then he'd come out and he'd bring hard-boiled eggs, and he'd give us hard-boiled eggs.  I remember that, and I remember that because he gave all of my siblings white hard-boiled eggs and he would always give me a brown one, and he would tell me that I got the brown one because I was born at Provident Hospital [Baltimore, Maryland].  Provident Hospital was the black hospital in Baltimore.
Speaker 1: That's an interesting story.
Speaker 2: Not very many memories as I said, you know eight years old.  I was in the first half of my third grade year.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did--do any of your family members have--have any stories about her that they passed down?  About what she--what her personality was like--?
Speaker 2: No, you know the trauma of losing your parents in that way, that early, we coped in different ways, but one thing was consistent among us all, we didn't talk about them.  I mean it was just a lost history for most of us and again, you know, there were whispered conversations among the older people, about things that happened with them and as I got older in life, my mother's sister, one of my mother's sisters--I remember telling me once, about an incident where my father and my mother had gone off on a train trip to Ohio. My grandfather, his name was Trevillian Wickham on my father's side, was a Pullman Porter.  His name was George.  You know all the Pullman Porters were called George.  He was a Pullman Porter, for the B&O Railroad and because he was a Pullman Porter he got special privileges to travel on the train, and at one point he allowed his son, my father, John Wickham to use his credentials to make this trip from Baltimore to Ohio, and in the process of making the trip, someone discovered that my grandfather's credentials were being improperly used and forced my father and my mother off the train, and so my--my aunt told me this with some degree of outrage, to point out how--just how much of a scoundrel my father actually was.
Speaker 1: All right, seems like a story that could happen to a lot of people, maybe, but not a--.
Speaker 2: I think so, but--I would think that underlying that story was a bit of rage.
Speaker 1: Yeah, probably.
Speaker 2: You know it was still festering.
Story_ID: 15251
Speaker 1: What did your mother [DeSylvia Virginia Wickham, nee Chase] do for a living--did she finish school do you know, or did she--?
Speaker 2: No, my mother--no.  My mother did not finish school, in those days my--my grandfather, William Howe, my maternal grandfather, didn't really think that his daughters should spend a lot of time in school and none of them were permitted to go to school beyond the seventh grade.  After the seventh grade they left school and went to work in the house and in the field around the house, working the garden, and that sort of thing. She--when my grandmother left her husband and moved to Baltimore [Maryland], she took the girls with her, and there were four of them: my Aunt Arlene, my Aunt Annette and my Aunt Mary Louise, which we kind of rolled together and called 'Marlouise,' and my grandmother went to work as a housekeeper for Jewish families at a large apartment complex in Baltimore, near the reservoir and the major park in town called Druid Hill Park, D-R-U-I-D, Druid Hill Park [Baltimore, Maryland], and my mother at an early age, and I think she was probably fifteen or sixteen at the time also went to work there cleaning houses and apartments and caring for the children of some of those families.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Later in life she, she worked for Cooper's clothing store, first as a salesperson and then later as a manager of that store, and that was owned by a Jewish merchant on a street called Pennsylvania Avenue.  Our Pennsylvania Avenue in Baltimore is quite different from the Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington, D.C.. There it's the seat of government. At the time in Baltimore, it was really the social and cultural hub of the black community.  People from Washington [D.C.] and Wilmington, Delaware and even as far away from Philly--as Philly [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] would come down to Pennsylvania Avenue.  It looked something like 125 Street [Harlem, New York]--just a long line of movie theaters and clubs, there was the I--the Ike Dixon's Comedy Club, and the Watusi Club.  It was really the kind of place where a lot of action was taking place.  Mom's soul food restaurant across from the Royal Theater, and across the Royal Theater was the stop in Baltimore that was a part of the--what we call--I guess the 'Chitlin Circuit,' that were--acts performed, black acts, around the nation.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: And she worked on Pennsylvania Avenue at the northern most tip of Pennsylvania Avenue in Cooper's clothing store.
Story_ID: 15252
Speaker 1: Tell me about your father's side of the family.  Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: My father's name is John Trevillian, T-R-E-V-I-L-L-I-A-N Wickham. My father was born in Baltimore, but his father, Trevillian Wickham was born in Richmond, Virginia, and he comes from a long line of Wickhams, who, traced their history back to one John Wickham, a white lawyer in Richmond, Virginia, who was quite famous in his day.  John Wickham was the chief attorney for Aaron Burr in his trial, the trial in which he was charged with treason.  Aaron Burr having been the vice president of the United States, under George Washington, having been tried for treason--at the time of his trial John Wickham was his principal defense attorney, and had a plantation in a county just outside--Hanover County, just outside of Richmond and then later owned a plantation in Richmond, and my line of the Wickhams in Richmond traced their roots back to him.  There is in Richmond today, in fact, a museum called the Wickham House, and the Wickham House is, in fact, the home that John Wickham had in Richmond, Virginia and the slave quarters, can now be seen in the basement of that house.
Speaker 1: That's interesting. Aaron Burr killed Alexander Hamilton in a duel back in--.
Speaker 2: In a duel, in--in New York, overlooking the Hudson [Hudson River].
Speaker 1: That's one of the more discussed historical figures in most of the nineteenth century, I guess.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So is there--are there any stories about John Wickham and that relationship?
Speaker 2: No--there's one interesting footnote here,  oh about, I guess maybe close to ten years ago now, I was working as a special commentator for CBS News and doing pieces--I was doing pieces on the CBS 'Sunday Morning Show,' the--the CBS 'Weekday Morning Show' and sometimes on the weekend news, and I was sent down to Richmond, Virginia to do a story that had something to do with tracing one's roots, and, so, of course, I used the Wickham House as a place to go because, I knew something about that history and my own roots being there, and the staff, in doing some research for me came upon a handwritten will. A will that was written by a white plantation owner in the southern most county of Virginia as you drive down Interstate 95, just a--just above the border line with North Carolina.  He left both of his plantations, in fact because he owned two--he left both his plantations to the children of Maggie Wickham. And he described them--one was--one's name was John and I forget the others name, but Maggie Wickham, I am told was my great-great-great-great, I believe four times grandmother, and this man left his plantation to her sons, one to each son. He left all of his household goods, including his feather bed--I wonder why--to Maggie Wickham, who he had freed, as he had freed her sons and even more interestingly, he left them his slaves.  At the bottom of this handwritten will is a notation, that the executor of the will refused to execute the will, upon reading the will he refused to execute the will.  He was, I think, the nephew of this gentlemen, and the sheriff took possession of the will, and I assume that at that point, all was lost to the Wickhams.
Speaker 1: This is an interesting story, because more often than--than I thought--you know, it would occur, I've heard this kind of a story, you know, not with the proportions and kind of money we are talking--we are probably talking about, but you you know, there are--many people we interview have there is a white man some place in their history who--,
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --who has a favorite woman and he--he passes on favors to the children because he is actually in love.
Speaker 2: Well, you know, what I find fascinating about this story is that we--you know we marvel at the relationship between Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemmings whom he never freed, and we call it a love story, and in this case Maggie Wickham was freed some time before the death of her master and her children were freed in advance, and then he left them his property.  Now, I am not sure that can make up for the injustices of slavery, nor can it make up for what might have occurred maybe not so willingly between him and Maggie Wickham.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: But it seems to me a more positive story than the one that we know to be the case between Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemmings.
Speaker 1: Right, yes.  One thing for sure the--the women in these scenarios didn't have any--any choice, but but, it's interesting to see that some of these men, actually--you know freed people and give them property and tried to support a family on some level even though it's really not a--. It's really interesting though. That's--that is an interesting story, and it's not surprising that it wasn't--that the will wasn't exe--you know, executed that way it should have been.
Speaker 2: No, not surprising at all.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, there's another story of John Randolph sending his slaves to Ohio to some land in Ohio.  When they got there of course, the people who were already there told them they couldn't stay there anyway.  They didn't care what the paper said, you know.
Speaker 2: Well, I think the Dred Scott decision that blacks have no rights that white men are bound to respect tells us all about that.
Speaker 1: That's right.  Okay, are there any other stories from that side of the family?  That sounds like a really--what happened to to the children that were supposed to inherit the property that--they didn't inherit--.
Speaker 2: I don't know.  Yeah, (simultaneously)--no, but I am still trying to patch together, as much as I can, you know that part of the family tree.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Yeah, there's some good stories in there some place.  Now, what about any--any other stories about the ancestors on that side?
Speaker 2: No, no, that's pretty much it.  That's as much as I know.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What did they do for a living basically when they--?
Speaker 2: My grandfather was a twin by the way, an identical twin.  His brother's name was Nathaniel John Wickham, and these names tend to repeat themselves in our family tree.  Nathaniel Wickham, John Wickham, Nathaniel John Wickham.  I am not sure where Trevillian came from.  Sounds like two last names to me, Trevillian-Wickham, but there is a repetition there, and interestingly, I was able to get a family tree of the original John Wickham from the Wickham House, and this--it's--it's just like parallel worlds.  The white Wickhams were John Wickham, Nathaniel John Wickham, Nathaniel Wickham.  The black Wickhams were  John Wickham, Nathaniel--you know, it was as though somehow we--we--there was a connection that almost unbreakable, between the two.
Speaker 1: Okay--,
Speaker 2: We've not been invited to any of their family reunions, nor have they to ours for that matter.
Story_ID: 15253
Speaker 1: When my parents died in 1953, the children of my parents, there were five of us--there were actually six of us, four that my mother [DeSylvia Virginia Wickham, nee Chase] and father [John Trevillian Wickham] shared, one my mother had before she met my father and one my father had as they say, "in the streets." People stopped talking to us about his side of the family. And it wasn't until the 1960s, late 1960s, when one day I was reading the papers, the 'Baltimore Sun,' and was amazed to see that there was a student--oh, this would have been later than that, this would have been--well maybe late 1960s, there was a student at Morgan [State University, Baltimore, Maryland], a football player, whose name was Andre Wickham.  Well, my oldest brother's name was Andre Wickham, and I thought it was just mere coincidence.  Some years later I ran into a guy named Byron Wickham,  B-Y-R-O-N, Byron Wickham--here in Baltimore, was working, I think, for an insurance company. My youngest brother's name was Myron Wickham.  Interesting, right?  Byron Wickham and Andre Wickham were of the Wickhams of Virginia.  They were the nephews of my grandfather's twin brother.  We had not had contact as a family.  My end of the family with their end of the family since 1953.  But somehow one kid named Byron the other kid named Myron, one kid named Andre, the other kid named Andre.  It was kind of a strange occurrence as though you know somehow we were you know mentally communicating in a telepathic way. And so we've kind of re-established contact now and we are beginning to talk to one another and it is through this new contact that we are talking about the family tree and how we connect, and we are trying to pursue that as much as possible.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now, do you know much about your father from relatives?  I mean did--did anybody, you know?
Speaker 1: Naw, no, my father, for, you know, what you might consider to be good reasons was not spoken of to me by my mother's siblings who raised us.  When--when--when--when the tragedy of their deaths occurred, the five children in the home were divided up.  I was sent along with my brother Rodney, whose name is actually John Rodney, another John Wickham, to an aunt in Cherry Hill [Baltimore, Maryland neighborhood]. My brother Andre, the oldest was sent to my grandmother--my maternal grandmother, Elizabeth Howe, whom we call 'Bessie' Howe--who others call her Bessie.  I call her 'Grandmamma.'  Bessie, her married name was Bessie Chase, and then my brother Myron was sent to one of my mother's sisters and my sister Reesa was sent to yet another.  So, we were divided and generally saw each other Christmas, maybe an outing in the park during the summer--during the summer, for about--that went on for maybe eight, ten years with very minimal contact because we were scattered.  There were not cars.  We didn't have cars in the family.  You know to get together required everyone getting on transit buses and going--so, it was really a rather difficult process to maintain contact and my mother's sisters didn't talk about my father--there was just no--there was no conversation at all about that side of the family.
Speaker 2: Okay. Did they talk about how your parents met at all?
Speaker 1: No, no.  There was literally--you see any conversation, I think they feared, would lead to questions about what happened in December of 1953, and so they literally never talked to me--to us, at least in my presence about our parents.  I mean it just almost never came up.
Story_ID: 15254
Speaker 1: Do you have an earliest childhood memory?  What's the first thing you remember as a child?
Speaker 2: I remember as a kid living on Whittier Avenue, which is located in northwest Baltimore [Maryland], just a few blocks away from where my mother [DeSylvia Virginia Wickham, nee Chase] worked.  There was a fig tree in our front yard, and I remember eating figs from the tree.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I don't think I've tasted a fig since those days, but I remember the fruit of the fig tree, and I remember eating the figs and, I--I remember eating them until I was sick to the stomach, and my mother came home and scolded me for being such a pig.
Story_ID: 15255
Speaker 1: I was asking you off-camera like how many brothers and sisters you have and I think you explained that (unclear).
Speaker 2: Three older brothers, I should say three brothers and two sisters. Two older brothers.  Andre was born in 1941, John Rodney was born in 1943, I came along in 46' [1946].  My sister Reesa was born in 1947 and then Myron, my mother and my father's child, and Sandra, my father's child by a woman not his wife, were both born in 1951.
Story_ID: 15256
Speaker 1: What were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up? And you grew up in Cherry Hill [Baltimore, Maryland neighborhood], right?
Speaker 2: I grew up in Cherry Hill and--and--as--as I said, Cherry Hill was supposedly a planned community, public housing for returning war veterans and for people who had come to Maryland to work in the war industry--for blacks who had come to Maryland to work in the war industry, and it really was at one point, a place with a lot of hills and cherry trees, which is how it came to be known as Cherry Hill.  It was located, and is still on the inner banks of the Patuxent River that--that feeds into the Chesapeake Bay.  The branches of the Patuxent River jet out into various sections of Baltimore city.  Baltimore's Inner Harbor--its now fabled Inner Harbor--sits on a branch of the Patuxent River.  Cherry Hill sits on yet another branch of the Patuxent River, and I remember as a young kid, there were places in Cherry Hill, there were woods into which we could disappear, there were wild apple trees and blackberry bushes, and cherry trees and you'd go and you could pick those fruit and eat them (laughter), and sometimes you did because that's all you would get to eat that day.  There was also on the tip of Cherry Hill in an area that was not so bucolic.  It was the Baltimore city dump.  At the time, Baltimore had basically two open air dumps.  One on the eastern side of town and one on the south side of town.  The south side of town being the dump adjacent to Cherry Hill, and it was a dump to which trash would be brought on a daily basis.  It was this steady flow of trash trucks down Cherryland Road.  I lived on Cherryland Road.  I lived one block from the dump, from the public dump, and these trucks would come, truck after truck after truck and they would drop their loads out into this open area, and there the--the trash would be allowed to sit until it dried and then it would be incinerated.  The would actually set it afire, and you'd see these burning mounds of trash. In the summer, the stench, you know, was just always there and after a while you got used to it, and in the winter there was just a kind of a warm breeze in the air, coming from--from the dump, a lot of rats came from the dump too.  And we made some sport out of going down to the dump killing rats, as kids would find some kind of weird pleasure in that sort of thing, and we did too.  We would go down to the dump and we'd kill rats.  But, I remember also--and this is almost a painful memory, I remember Mrs. Craddock who lived two doors down the street from me.  She was Johnny Craddock's--Johnny Craddock was one of the kids--Johnny and Edwin, were the kids and Sheila was the daughter.  There were three kids in the house.  Their mother Mrs. Craddock, when--when the trucks would come--certain trucks would come from the port, Baltimore being a very big port city--when the customs officers would find crates that had--that were broken upon arrival, they would seize those items and throw them away.  And so, oftentimes the trucks would come down and you'd see them with foodstuffs like lettuce, or tomatoes and often--oftentimes bananas, long stalks of bananas, and Mrs. Craddock would take her leather shopping bag and her cane, and she'd walk down to the dump and she'd pick tomatoes and lettuce and bananas and she'd use the cane to kind of beat away the rats, and literally would go shopping at the dump.  And we would always make fun of Mrs. Craddock, but I remember we'd always also ask Johnny, who was our equal in age, if he'd get us a banana.
Speaker 1: So--?
Speaker 2: The bananas would ripen in his closet and he'd bring us a banana out.  We weren't laughing then.
Speaker 1: That's a--sounds like a--tough neighborhood?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  It was--it was--it was an interesting place.  You know the--the other interesting thing about Cherry Hill, the projects in which I grew up.  I went there in 1953--public housing--every house had a mother and father, every father had a job, virtually no one had a car.  People would walk to the bus stop to go to work, but families were in tact, and I remember--I remember my first recollection of a family that was comprised of just a mother and no father and the stigma that was associated with it, literally--literally drove that woman out of the community.  I mean--it's just--it's so different than--than it is today.  You could not--you know, you couldn't be a part of the community, and it really was a community, when Mrs. Garrett, who had I think eleven children in a three-bedroom unit--housing project, when she got her welfare allocation about a fifty pound bag of flour and a big block of cheese and molasses and apple butter--a big tin of apple butter, she'd share it with others in on the block.
Story_ID: 15257
Speaker 1: My Aunt Annette who raised me, took me into her home.  She had six children of her own, and she took in myself and my brother John Rodney.  Eight kids, my Aunt Annette and her husband, Theodore, two adults in a two-bedroom public housing unit, living room, kitchen--eat-in-kitchen--two bedrooms at the top of the steps.  Bathroom, tub--no shower.  Baths on Saturday were a luxury, during the week you got to the bowl and you washed with a cloth. She was too proud to go on welfare, but she wasn't too proud to beg, and so she would often send us with a little cup down to Mrs. Garrett's house and ask for two cups of flour, so she could make us some biscuits or pancakes, or we'd go to Mrs. Blackwell's house and borrow some butter, butter, not margarine, because the federal government in their welfare allocation gave us butter.  Big blocks of butter, as well. And so--and people shared. I mean sometimes there was a little griping, but willingly, more often than not everyone kind of reached out to keep everyone--the other afloat.
Speaker 2: And, so she wouldn't go on welfare herself, but she was, you know--.
Speaker 1: No, she worked, she worked as a barmaid, and she worked usually from eleven to seven, so she'd go to work late at night and come home first thing in the morning. My uncle, Theodore MacClaine, worked for the Calvert Distillery Company, not too far from Cherry Hill [Baltimore, Maryland neighborhood], and he was one of those guys who got into the big vats, where they mixed the liquor and he cleaned--his job was to clean them out, and at some point he slipped and hurt himself and hurt his back and--and was injured and couldn't work anymore and it wasn't long after that, that he left the family, and then there was just my aunt and the eight kids--the eight of us.
Speaker 2: Now, did, was--okay, let's--you know--this is a kind of crazy question I guess, but I was thinking when you said that he worked in a distillery and she worked in a bar, was there any--did they provide any resources to the community from those--?
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: I was wondering, you know.
Speaker 1: No, (laughter).
Speaker 2: 'Cause people were giving them butter, they were like--.
Speaker 1: He didn't get to bring home any samples.  He may have--he may have taken of some while he was on the job, but he--he didn't bring home any samples. He was really a very quiet kind of guy.  I don't think I ever saw him drunk, but I don't think I ever saw him very much outside of bed.  I mean he was the kind of guy he'd come home, he'd go to bed, he'd get up--he was a very natty dresser, and he'd get up and--usually when he was up, he was out.  If he was up on his feet, you know he was--he'd get his clothes on, he was out the house. Something happened in that marriage and I don't know what it was but--but at some point after he injured himself, he left the family, and then my aunt was there, left to take care of the eight children and the house and it was a real bumpy ride.
Speaker 2: This was your mother's [DeSylvia Virginia Wickham, nee Chase] sister, right?
Speaker 1: This was my mother's sister--this was my mother's youngest sister, actually, yeah.

Speaker 1: Those were the days in the early '50s [1950s] right after the war.  A lot of people had like real tight living conditions in a small space with a whole lot of people living in the space--.
Speaker 2: Well, listen, eight kids, two adults, and then one adult, two bedrooms, living room, eat-in-kitchen, that was it, and so we had some tough sleeping conditions. My aunt [Annette] decided to sleep the older--the oldest boys according to age.  So I slept in a twin bed with a cousin who was six years--I'm sorry, six months younger, and my brother Rodney, slept in the other twin bed with a cousin who was six months younger than he was. My aunt's two oldest boys--the two I just described were both bed wetters, and so instead of putting the two bed wetters together, she slept us by age and every night, literally, for seven, eight years, from 1953 until--oh, I guess we moved out of Cherry Hill [Baltimore, Maryland neighborhood] around 1959--so, about six years, literally every night, my cousin wet me in bed.  He wet the bed, and--he wet the bed and the bed was wet and I was in the bed, you know, and it was just a very traumatizing kind of, situation, particularly when you have so much poverty in the house. At the beginning of every school year, my aunt would go out and buy clothes for the children, and I knew what I would get each year.  Two pair of khaki pants, one grey, one brown, sometimes one black, which would alternate for one of the other colors, a couple of polo shirts and a pair of converse tennis shoes. That was the outfit. That was the uniform, and you know, you'd probably get two or three pair of underwear.  Not many more than that.  I think--think they came three to a pack. Three pair of shorts and three undershirts, and when you got a kid next to you wetting every night, yeah, it's kinda tough, and it was really rough and there--and you know, that on top of the poverty in the winter when you would go to school when there were holes in the bottom of your tennis shoes and you'd put cardboard in the bottom because it was snow outside and you are trying to get to school.  You know, you--you--and kids can be terribly cruel.  You know when they catch you in the shop class, stuffing your tennis shoes with cardboard.  You'd hear about that for about a week.  I remember, my aunt got a little money at one point and took us to Thom McCann shoe store, and I think they had the special, two pairs for $5.99 or something like that.  She bought one pair for me and one pair for my, my cousin, and they were not the best of shoes, and I remember maybe two or three months into the school year, I got what we call 'alligator shoes,' where the bottom of the sole release from the shoe and it would--it would flap as you walked, and a good friend of mine who was (laughter) probably even--he came--he come from an even poorer family than mine, told me that if I went to the shop class early, we could get the big staple gun, or the big stapler and staple my--my shoes back together and we did that.  We stapled my shoes back together, but we mistakenly stapled them from the bottom up instead of the top down, and so, you know, the--the halls of the--the school building were some sort of concrete.  It was a polished kind of concrete, and as you'd walk through the school building, about halfway through the day, it would wear out the staples and then you had, not only the flap of the leather, but the sound of the staple slapping against the floor as well.  Ultimately, I just got a pair of scissors and cut off the flap, and it took about two or three days before my feet were literally out on the ground, I mean those were the kind of situations you lived with.  I didn't know, I didn't know that one person could own more than one pair of shoes at a time or more than two or three pair of underwear.  My wife [Wanda Nadine Persons] says today, by the way, my wife says that I have so many pairs of underwear and socks and--and I literally--I mean it's kind of maybe a bit tacky to discuss this kind of thing, but I probably have a couple hundred pair, and I don't have any excess in clothing beyond that.  Simply because I went through most of my formative years having no more than one or two pair of underwear to wear and one or two pair of socks, and you know when you are a kid and you wear what we call 'street socks' in your sneakers, throughout the entire summer, at the end of the summer they have a crust on the bottom.  The kind of crust--and they literally disintegrate, you know, and so all those memories have kind of trained me and conditioned me in such a way that I place great value strangely in dressing from the inside out.

Speaker 1: How would you describe your personality as a kid growing up?  I mean what were you like and what did you like to do?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Different from my brother whom I grew up--my brother John Rodney, very introverted. I don't think we had--living in the same house, I don't think we had ten un-forced conversations in a decade. He just never spoke to me. Speaking to me, I think was--was the thing that would revive the memory of what had happened to our parents [murder-suicide of his parents, DeSylvia Virginia Wickham, nee Chase and John Trevillian Wickham].  So he just literally didn't speak to me.  He didn't speak to too many other people either.  He was--he was always considered a very quiet person.  I, on the other hand, was pretty much of a extrovert, and we dealt with the--the trauma of our parents' deaths in different ways.  I talked my way past everything.  Yakety, yak, yak I was the guy who made the jokes.  I was laughing, you know, my whole thought was, if I can keep them laughing--if I can keep the conversation going--if I can direct the conversation, then the conversation can never turn in the direction that I don't want it to go, and so, I was always the one out front.  I was the kid who attracted other kids, I was the leader of the pack, I was the one who told all the jokes.  I use to know all the mother jokes then, your mother is, you know, that sort of thing and then I--I knew all that.  I was always the one setting the agenda and kind of moving things along, and it was a defense mechanism.

Speaker 1: Where did you go to school?  Did you--?
Speaker 2: Well, when I moved to Cherry Hill [Baltimore, Maryland neighborhood] in the third grade, I went to Cherry Hill Elementary School.  That was the oldest of the schools. PS 159 was the identifying number for the school, and I was there a year.  Finished my third grade year there, and in the fourth grade, because of the--the rapidly expanding population in Cherry Hill, they had to bus us out of Cherry Hill, to another elementary school which was PS 156, in a place called Mount Winans, W-I-N-A-N-S.  Mount Winans was a community [of Baltimore, Maryland], a black community, probably as the crow flies four miles, maybe three or four miles from Cherry Hill, but between Mount Winans and Cherry Hill was a community called Westport [Baltimore, Maryland neighborhood].  Westport was a white community, had a five-story elementary school, it was under-utilized and the bus that took me from Cherry Hill to PS 156, drove every day right past PS 225, which was the elementary school in Westport.  Right past the front of the building.
Speaker 1: Now, was the Baltimore public school system officially segregated in those days?
Speaker 2: Well, we're talking 1954.  So it was the year of the Brown decision [Brown versus the Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas], the year of my fourth grade, 1955, the year of my fifth grade, so, the law had changed, but the practice had not.
Speaker 1: So, but---but it was officially segregated before '54 [1954]--I mean officially?
Speaker 2: Well, I--I don't think it was officially segregated in the sense that there was this kind of Jim Crow practice that was obvious, but in practice it was.  I mean there was--it was not the kind of--Baltimore is the soft south, it's not the hard south.  Maryland is the soft south.  It's just below the Mason-Dixon Line, and so it was never in your face, but the practice was--that--if it was a white neighborhood, the schools were gonna be white, and if there was a black neighborhood, the schools would be black, and--if--in a black neighborhood your schools became over-crowded, first they would bring you portables, and when the portables became too crowded, they'd bus you to another community.  If that meant busing you as they did past PS 225 in Westport, that's what they did, and when I got to [PS] 156, a one-story elementary school, the school was crowded, so they put me in a portable.  They bused me from one community, past a under-utilized school, to attend elementary school in a portable, on the playground of Mount Winans Elementary School [Baltimore, Maryland].  I did the fourth and the fifth grade there. By the time of the sixth grade, a new elementary school had opened in Cherry Hill, Patapsco Elementary School, 1- [PS] 163, I think was the number, and I did my sixth grade there.  Actually, I went to 164, I'm sorry.  164, and I did my sixth grade there.
Speaker 1: Now, how did you like school as a--did you like it--I mean as, you told us some over-crowded conditions, and you know--but--but did you like school and--?
Speaker 2: Loved the third grade when I got to Cherry Hill because they let me pass out the, the graham crackers and milk.  You know, coming off of the trauma of my parents' [DeSylvia Virginia Wickham, nee Chase and John Trevillian Wickham] death, the teachers were very kind to me.  So, they would let me be one of the kids who always to go each morning to get the graham crackers and the milk, and that was something of a privilege because there was only enough milk for each kid to have one carton, and--and you could get a choice between vanilla milk and chocolate milk, or as we call it in those days white milk and chocolate milk, and or, I should say it was just the other way around.  It was white milk that we called vanilla milk and but when the chocolate milk ran out, you had to take the white milk, and so since I was the one to deliver the milk and graham crackers to the class, I always got my chocolate milk. It was fun--elementary school was fun.  I enjoyed elementary school.
Story_ID: 15261
Speaker 1: It was a little bit harder in middle school--what we call junior high--because, you know, now you're at that age, you--you're getting into your teens and kids are beginning to pay attention to how you dress, how you look, they made fun of me because I probably had an afro, somewhere closer to what Frederick Douglass had than what H. Rap Brown had, and afros hadn't come into vogue, in the mid 1950s.
Speaker 2: So you're saying that you all really couldn't afford a haircut or--?
Speaker 1: No, not often.  No, you know, we--once a month, maybe.  You know, in those days my hair grew a lot faster than it grows now.  You know, so and sometimes you'd go a lot longer than that?
Speaker 2: So, what--what junior high school did you attend?
Speaker 1: I went to Cherry Hill Junior High [School] in Cherry Hill [Baltimore, Maryland neighborhood], which you know, back to the point that I made earlier about us thinking that Cherry Hill was in fact, a--a separate community, we had a mayor of Cherry Hill.  Well, he was really the postman, but he lived in Cherry Hill.  He was a brother, his name was Shepard Burge (ph.) and he, he was the mayor--he told us he was the mayor of Cherry Hill and we had no reason to doubt him, not knowing anything about our community other than where the schools were and the community center, and we knew that Mr. Burge ran the Cherry Hill Coordinating Council. What gave him even greater prestige was that in the mix of housing in Cherry Hill, most of the homes were public housing units--projects as we call them.  the next largest block of homes was subsidized units, subsidized housing, and then it was a small block of privately-owned homes and Mr. Burge lived in one of those homes, and when Mr. Burge told us he was the mayor of Cherry Hill, coming out of that little rancher that he lived in, we did not doubt him.  So, we thought we had a separate community, and we--we really very much thought that it was good living there. I mean we didn't--as bad as we had it, we didn't know we were poor.  I mean, we didn't see T.V..  I mean, you seldom saw a T.V., you know some families had the little black and white sets.  Most families didn't.  Didn't listen to a lot radio.  Most of what we did was get up in the morning, eight kids in that small house and go outside, and stay outside and pretty much until it was meal time, or time to go to bed.  I remember, as a kid, my aunt [Annette] would say to us in the summertime--.  She'd wake us on a Saturday morning, she'd give us each fifty cents.  It cost thirty-five cents to get into the movie theater, and she'd give us fifty cents and she'd say, go to the movies, and don't come home until it's dark. Nine o'clock in the morning she was sending us out the door on a Saturday.  Go to the movies and don't come home until it's dark. Well you know, twelve hours later it would be dark.  In those days, you know, the movies was two feature films, a serial, a couple of cartoons and coming attractions, and you'd probably have to do the cycle two and a half times, maybe close to three times, before you could go home.
Speaker 2: So, would you actually stay in there that long?
Speaker 1: If the weather was bad outside, we stayed in there, but a lot of times we'd--we'd, you know, we wouldn't go in for the first feature.  We just hung around the shopping center, we had a little L-shaped shopping district that we called the shopping center.  It was really, I think, a very vibrant place. There was a barber shop, a beauty shop, there was Simple Simon which was a place where you would buy subs and sandwiches and that sort of thing.  There was a black-owned clothing store, I should say a black-owned ladies clothing store and then there was Singers Men's Shop, S-I-N-G-E-R-S, Singers Men's Shop, which was owned by a Jewish fellow, who, was the merchant, almost the mayor of the shopping center, in the sense that he was also always standing outside of his store, and he--he greeted most people by their names, he would give credit, well, he would tell you he was giving you credit, and for a long time I thought it was credit.  It was really layaway.  I remember the first time I put something on layaway at Mr. Singer's store.  He took me to the back of the store and gave me this wonderful lecture about the responsibilities of credit, and it took me maybe, I know, about three or four months to pay off the items, and I was bragging to everyone that I had credit at Mr. Singer's clothing store. The items that I purchased stayed in a box--.
Speaker 2: In the store?
Speaker 1: In the storeroom until I paid for them, but, but it was a different kind of experience.
Speaker 2: Okay, yeah, I've met a lot of those--those kind of shops in those days--(unclear) thinking--I know where I grew up there was the same kind of a situation.
Speaker 1: We had an A&P, a pool hall, the obligatory liquor store, and a laundromat.  I tell you it really was the hub of the community, and when you went to the shopping center, you know you could hang out there all day and just standing around talking, yak it up and go out beyond the back of the shopping center and sometimes you would find some wino you'd give a--a buck to and he'd go get you a--a drink, if you were inclined to drink.  I wouldn't drink, but all my friends did. And so--.
Speaker 2: These are junior high school kids?
Speaker 1: I--I--smoked one day in my life.  One day we stole a a carton of Kools out of the A&P, and went off to the elementary school and sat out back and tried to learn how to inhale, and I made myself so sick that I was throwing up, and it was the one day in my life that I smoked a cigarette.  I was--I--my preference was something that they called Lotta Cola.  I remember when the first sixteen ounce colas came out, and this one was called Lotta Cola, and Lotta Cola was bottled on Baltimore Street, and in these days in those days, there was a big cooler in the just outside of the door of the gas station, at--at the shopping center, and you could lift--you could raise the top of the cooler and reach in--there was just a ton of ice, and just putting your hand in there would do--almost chilled you to--to the bone.  You could pull your Lotta Cola and go in and give the guy a nickel for your sixteen ounce soda, and it was like a hit--a shot to the chest (claps like a shot)--oh, (laughter) you know, it just had that kind of kick to it.  And so for me Lotta Cola was better than Thunderbird and Mooby-Fooby and--and, all those other drinks that that the guys partook of.
Speaker 2: Okay, we going to pause here and change tape.
Speaker 1: I remember Lotta Cola.
Speaker 2: You remember Lotta Cola?
Speaker 1: And Bubble-Up.

Speaker 1: So junior high school is when the--the, you know, everybody becomes aware of what kind of clothes you wear and what your status is.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) It became--it became more of a social stigma, my condition. And I became more aware of my state of poverty, because even in Cherry Hill [Baltimore, Maryland neighborhood] there were some stratifications where--along the economic ladder.  There were kids who came to school who had more than others and most had more than I did.  You know, and you became painfully aware of that. The laughter didn't help any--I was the class clown. I was class clown in the seventh grade and, and--and reprised that role in the eighth grade, and that helped a bit, you know, in homeroom they couldn't shut me up, but it was all intended to kind of keep the focus away from me in the sense that, you know, people would not be laughing at me, I wanted them laughing with me, and, and I did that at--at a time when I was fairly successful in school.  I mean I--I didn't burn down any--any libraries, you know, in terms of chasing after knowledge, but I did fairly well and I was probably a high C student.  Got--got a few Bs and that sort of thing.  In--in those days we got number grades.  Eighties and--and seventies and that sort of thing.
Speaker 1: Was it hard to--hard to study in the environment that you grew up in or did you--?
Speaker 2: Well, it was hard to study because we didn't have any books from which to study.  I mean, I remember very clearly in the eighth grade reading a history book in class, because we had to.  We had to--the--the way you would study--there were not enough books to take books home.  There was just enough books for the class, and since there were other classes coming in, you got rotating eighth grade classes--if there were only forty books to the class, and she had maybe in her three classes, you know, a hundred or something kids, nobody could take the book home, so you would read from the chapters in class and she would have us, you know, "DeWayne read page seventeen," and then "Joseph read page eighteen." And I remember, in my class clown role, one day a guy by the name of Joseph--Joseph Bunn, who was from Mount Winans [Baltimore, Maryland neighborhood] by the way.  He was now bused over to Cherry Hill, to attend our middle school [Cherry Hill Junior High School, Baltimore, Maryland]--reading in a world history class about France and some events that happened in France and as he was reading along, he he was reading and then he began to say, "And nappy Leon said," or whatever, and there was this pause as the teacher kind of did a double take 'cause she had her teacher's book and I just whooped it up, and I just bust out laughing.  I was just on the floor and many of the other students weren't quite sure what was going on, but he had come to the name "Napoleon" and he read it "Nappy Leon," that's one of my fondest memories.  It also causes me to recall what happened afterwards.  Joseph was so humiliated that he he challenged me to a fight. Joseph was a pretty big guy, but I wasn't going to back down in front of my friends, and so I told him I'd take him on. I'd meet him at the bus stop.  He had to catch the bus back to Mount Winans. I told him I'd be there, and he waited.  The bus left.  I never showed up (laughter).  He had to walk home.

Speaker 1: You are a journalist and you--you are, you know, a well respected journalist, and--and in those days did you pay attention to--to the news at all?  Did--was--was radio or T.V. a big part of growing up or--?
Speaker 2: I was--from my earliest memories I was just a consumer, a sponge for news and information.  I remember listening to radio as a kid.  Now I remember listening to 'The Lone Ranger' and--and that sort of thing on--on 'Amos 'n Andy' ['The Amos 'n Andy Show'] and then that sort of thing on the radio.  But I also remember listening to radio news.  I was an avid reader of newspapers.  I read the 'News American,' which was the evening newspaper in Baltimore [Maryland].  In those days there were three papers in Baltimore--three daily papers. The 'News American,' which was a Hearst paper, and the 'Baltimore Sun' and the 'Evening Sun,' two Suns--two papers then owned by what was called the AS Abell Company, and then, of course, it was the--the 'Afro American Newspaper,' which oh, we really read--I mean to be noted or recognized in the 'Afro' was only second to being mentioned in what we called the 'Jet,' [magazine] (laughter) you know, and not many people in Cherry Hill [Baltimore, Maryland neighborhood]--I don't think--I don't know of anyone in Cherry Hill who ever got mentioned in the 'Jet,' but to get into the 'Afro American' was a big deal, so I was--yeah, I was just an avid reader.  I--I loved history.  I mean I was--one of the reasons why I recognized that "nappy Leon" was really Napoleon [classmate confused the two]--I mean I was--I was always reading history.  I just--I--from the earliest days, I loved history. So an avid reader, and as I tell students now, at North Carolina A&T State University [North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University, Greensboro, North Carolina] where I hold a distinguished professorship, I tell students that the key--the key to writing is reading. If you want to be a good writer, you must be an avid reader.
Speaker 1: Oh, now where did the verve for reading come from?  I mean--I mean, you know, obviously, you liked to read, but was--was there any role model or mentor in terms of reading when you were coming up?
Speaker 2: My mother [DeSylvia Virginia Wickham nee Chase] was a reader.  You asked me about memories and that one just--you just kind of triggered that.  My mother was a reader.  She read a lot of books.  I've got one I need to show you in fact.  I remember at one of my book signings when I wrote my book 'Woodholme' ['Woodholme: A Black Man's Story of Growing Up Alone'], a woman came to me and introduced herself.  I don't recall her name. She was my mother's hairdresser and she had an appointment to do my mother's hair on the day--the morn--the day after, or I guess the morning--my mother was killed in the early morning hours, that evening--that afternoon she had an appointment to do--she scheduled for my mother to come in to have her hair done, and my mother had loaned her a book. We are talking 1954, 'Woodholme' came out in 1995. And on my book tour, a woman walked up to me and hands me a tattered book, and she said this is your mother's book, and told me the story about how my mother had loaned her this book, and in fact, it's the only copy of my mother's handwriting that I had, because she had written her name on the inside of the book. But I knew that she was an avid reader, and I think maybe subconsciously I've picked that up from her.
Speaker 1: What was the name of the book?
Speaker 2: I don't recall the name, but I have the book to show you, and I'll pull it out.  In fact, I gave the book to a book restorer, a woman who restores books, at Johns Hopkins University [Baltimore, Maryland] and she did a wonderful job.  She restored the book and she built me a special case in which to carry the book.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, were there any teachers that encouraged you to read and gather information?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, one--one who just passed a couple of weeks ago, Bernice Brown, who was my home room teacher in the seventh grade and the eighth grade.  She was also my science teacher, and Mrs. Brown was a very snappy kind of person . She was very perky, a lot of energy, and little tolerance for kids who acted out in class, and so, it was often the case that I spent some hours or some time after class sitting with her, you know, cleaning blackboards and--and running other chores because she would always lecture about my great promise and potential, and my bad deportment.
Story_ID: 15264
Speaker 1: And did--did you all have a T.V. at home?
Speaker 2: We had a T.V. at home for some periods of time, but I remember it was off more than it was one. It had the big vacuum tubes and oh boy, I can remember "DeWayne, take this tube up to the..."--the--the T.V. went off, you know sometimes you'd have to pull two or three tubes.  You couldn't be quite sure which one was out, although some of them would--there'd be no more illumination, but sometimes they would flicker, so she'd pull out two or three tubes and send me up to the hardware store, where they would test the tubes to see if they were--.
Speaker 1: You test the machine.
Speaker 2: Yeah, right, yeah, you'd test the tubes and then you'd purchase a new one, but oftentimes the job was really just to find out which tubes were bad, how much would they cost, bring 'em back and we'd make a note, and then when some money came in, we'd buy a good tube, and sometimes the T.V. would be down, you know for weeks at a time.  It was a black and white T.V. and again because we had such close quarters, the three--three of the younger kids slept in the living room on the fold-out couch.  They were in bed by eight, and usually the T.V. was off at the latest by nine.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, you didn't have any favorite T.V. shows or anything like that coming up, I guess?
Speaker 2: 'Gunsmoke.' "Mr. Dillon, Mr. Dillon!"  (Laughter).  I remember 'Gunsmoke' and Chester [Chester Goode, a 'Gunsmoke' character], and--that was one of my favorites.  I think it was a Saturday night show if I remember correctly.
Speaker 1: That's right.  Saturday night at ten o'clock.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) That was Saturday night T.V. watching.  That's when all kind of gathered around as a family and watched T.V. and, yeah, come on, I got to admit this--I--Ed Sullivan ['The Ed Sullivan Show'], and then later when it came on the Wonderful World of Disney, to see 'Davy Crockett' and 'Daniel Boone' and those kinds of shows, but you know, I remember sitting around watching a whole season of Ed Sullivan, waiting for the Supremes, or waiting for the Four Tops, or waiting for Pearl Bailey, or waiting for Sammy Davis, Jr., you know to appear on--you know it didn't--it didn't happen often, but you knew it would and when it happened there was just a different kind of interest in watching 'The Ed Sullivan Show.'
Speaker 1: Yeah, that was a show that I remember people were hollering it's colored people on--black people on T.V..
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah, and then there was a show, boy what was the guy's name?  The--Jack Benny ['The Jack Benny Show'] and--.
Speaker 1: Rochester [Eddie 'Rochester' Anderson played 'Rochester Van Jones' on the television show], you're talking about.
Speaker 2: And Rochester, yeah.  "Mr. Benny!"  Yeah.
Speaker 1: That was one of the few shows where the the black person got the best of the white man, you know.
Speaker 2: Well--yeah, yeah, yeah.  So there were a few shows but, I--I'm probably collapsing a lot time there, but there were a few shows and I remember 'Amos 'n Andy,' and I remember a lit bit of the of the fear over the show and--and that sort of thing.  I--and for a long time I agreed with the criticism, but now I've come to--I've come full cycle on that.  Now, I look back at 'Amos 'n  Andy'--I have a full set by the way of all the shows.  I have a set of all the shows, and I've looked at them recently and what I've come to understand is that the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] was probably wrong about 'Amos 'n  Andy.'  When you look back at 'Amos 'n Andy' today, almost every black person on that show had a job, with the exception of 'King Fish.'  Black FBI agents--when the when the--the Mystic Knights of the City went to convention, they went to a Chica--a black-owned hotel in Chicago [Illinois].  I'm not sure there were many then, but this was a big downtown one, there were black judges--it was interesting how blacks had roles--did I say there was a black FBI agent?  There was a black FBI agent, that clearly (laughter)--we did not have in the general society, and so it was more positive--I think, in retrospect--than negative.

Speaker 1: Was church a part of growing up?
Speaker 2: Church was a part of growing up for a while. My grandmother, coming from the Methodist tradition in Calvert County [Maryland]--when she moved to Baltimore [Maryland] she joined John Wesley's Methodist church, which was in south Baltimore, not in Cherry Hill [Baltimore, Maryland neighborhood], but near the community and she would take a bus on Sundays and go over to John Wesley's, and about once a month she would take me and a couple of my siblings and I should--my, my--a couple of my cousins over to the church, on a Sunday when they--was a day-long kind of activity other churches would come--other congregations would come in and there would be dinner afterwards, and we went because we wanted the meal.  The fried chicken and the collard greens and that sort of thing in the basement. My aunt, my mother's oldest sister, Mary--Mary Louise, who we called 'Marlouise,' was a member of the Cherry Hill Presbyterian Church [Baltimore, Maryland], and for the first three or four years of my time in Cherry Hill, I went regularly to Cherry Hill--to the Presbyterian church.  I, I took confirmation class there.  I was baptized in the Cherry Hill Presbyterian Church.  I remember Mrs. Murphy, who who was the one who trained us for--who conducted the confirmation class. She required us to learn all the chapters of the Bible, and we'd have to come--.
Speaker 1: The names of the chapters?
Speaker 2: The names of the chapter not literally the content, but the names of the chapter.  And we'd have to come in--we'd have to recite the chapters of the Bible and when you didn't get it right she had an eighteen inch rule and she'd make you hold out hand and she'd smack your hand. And--and so after a while I kind of you know learned that the best defense was a good offense.  I learned very quickly the chapters of the Bible.  My aunt would send us there, with a dime--to church on Sundays. And we would put the dime into into the collection plate. Sinners that we were, we would go instead to the--to that gas station where they had the soft drink machine and we'd buy cookies because you could get two buttercup cookies for a penny.  And we'd buy ten buttercup cookies for a nickel and take the other nickel to the church. So we sort of short-changed the church for a while.  Eventually the money ran out when--when my uncle [Theodore MacClaine] left the family, and we didn't have money to go to church--money to take to church. And eventually we had a fairly good reason not to go to church because we didn't have clothing and that sort thing and you just--you--we--kind of slipped away.  My aunt [Annette] stayed very active in the church.  My oldest brother [Andre Wickham] joined Cherry Hill Baptist Church [Baltimore, Maryland] where he became very active.  He was a boy scout leader for a while.  He, he sang in the choir.  At one time he was the choir director.  He was a--he played piano.  He fancies himself a singer, voice probably wasn't as good as he thought, but--but he--good enough for church, and he stayed very active in the church. But probably around the time of about oh, seventh or eighth grade, church became a distant part of my existence for a fairly good reason.  Well, maybe there is never a good reason not to go to church but there was an economic component to it.  I became to caddy at a country club and Saturdays and Sundays at the Jewish county club where I caddied, were the best days and you could make the most money.

Speaker 1: I was going to ask you about work without you know--being in dire straits like that--was that the first job you--you had?
Speaker 2: No, my first job I had was as a grocery boy at the A&P. They didn't hire us to come inside but we had makeshift wagons outside and we would transport people's groceries to their homes.  Cherry Hill [Baltimore, Maryland neighborhood] was a fairly big community.  I mean you--we--we're probably talking several hundred acres of land, and so at the most distant point someone would probably have to walk maybe a mile--mile--mile and a quarter to get to the grocery store to do their grocery shopping.  With precious few cars--there were some who had cars and they would charge you to serve as a kind of a livery service and drive you home but whatever they charged--we charged probably half of that to put your groceries on our wagon--our makeshift wagon.
Speaker 1: When you say makeshift what do you mean? Did you all kind of make--?
Speaker 2: We would use milk crates--we'd use any--any kind of wood product we could find and generally we would put underneath of--of the wood crates, the remnants of our Christmas gifts, ball bearing #5 roller--street--street skates.  You know the street skates you'd get?  Union, they were called Union.  The brand name was Union Ball Bearings #5.  I don't know what happened to one, two, three and four but we had Union Ball Bearings #5.  The street skates that you would--put--clamp them to your shoes.  we would take those and attach them to--pull them apart and attach them to the bottom of--of a plank of wood--put a little steering device on the front and we'd pull people's groceries to their homes and we'd charge twenty-five, fifty cents and I did that for a while, but when I found out about caddying--.
Speaker 1: How did you find out about that?
Speaker 2: One of the guys from the neighborhood came home one day and said, "Man I've been out to the country club."  He made two dollars that day.  It was a fortune.  It was a fortune. And so I began to caddy, it wasn't long before I was earning eighty to a hundred dollars a week--eighty to a hundred--now it was a seven day week in the summer.  Eighty to a hundred dollars and so I was quickly out of the church and into the caddy shack.
Speaker 1: That's ten or more dollars a day.
Speaker 2: It more money that any adult I knew brought home for a work week.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: That's pretty good. Now, how old were you when you started--?
Speaker 2: When I first started, I was what they call a 'single caddy' cause I only carried one bag and so I didn't make quite that much money.  You'd make two--you'd make four dollars if you carried one bag for eighteen holes you'd make four dollars.  Eighteen holes would take about four--four and a half hours so you could do maybe two rounds in a day.  So I could make--make eight bucks in a day.  And that lasted for a couple of years so I prob--it was probably by ninth grade--by the time I was in the ninth grade certainly by the time I was in the tenth grade I was an 'A caddy.'  I was a double caddy, I could carry two bags.  And, in carrying two bags you double your money but you also probably get tips.  And so I had walked eighteen holes and maybe pick up ten bucks for one round.  Do two rounds in a day, twenty bucks a day, five days a week, you know, you're at the hundred dollar mark and usually Mondays were half days because Mondays were Ladies Day, 'cause it was Ladies Day at the golf course.  The men couldn't play until afternoon--until after mid-day.  So the women would come out early in the morning and play from eight until twelve or one, and there wouldn't be a lot of men coming out in the afternoon--usually older guys who were retired and that sort of thing.  So most of the caddies didn't show up on Mondays.  I went every Monday.  Once I started caddying I went literally every day.  From the ninth grade until until I ended my years in school at the end of my eleventh grade year.  Having been put out of one high school and put out of three high schools actually.
Speaker 1: Was there anything that you learned from being in that environment that--that you know supplemented what you learned in school?  Being in--in that country club--these Jewish guys playing golf?
Speaker 2: I learned the value of work.  I learned the value of work.  I mean I went to work everyday.  I was--I was--I was in the ninth grade. The summer of my ninth grade year--I went to work everyday.  My friends went out to play and I went to work everyday and I went to work everyday and I accumulated money and I amassed some small measure of wealth.  I remember at the end of the summer I had several hundreds--several hundred dollars.

Speaker 1: You know, by the ninth grade I should tell you--by the ninth grade--the end of my ninth grade year as I was moving from the ninth grade to the tenth grade, my aunt [Annette] and I'd had a parting of the ways. I no longer lived in her house.  She had literally expelled me from the house.
Speaker 2: What happened?  Why did she--?
Speaker 1: Times got tough and as times got tough, conditions worsened in the house. We moved out of Cherry Hill [Baltimore, Maryland neighborhood] there was a--there was a moment in time when she met another man, and he held a job and the relationship looked promising--they didn't marry but they cohabitated.  He wanted to take us out of the projects.  He moved us into--into the city as we referred to it. And we moved into a row house in west Baltimore on Hilton Street, 201 South Hilton Street and it was a four-bedroom house.  We didn't have any furniture. We had mattresses on the floor but it was still a much better existence.  It had a yard and that sort of thing.  But the relationship somehow went bad and after about a year he left. When he left she couldn't make the rent payments.  She had been receiving from the time I first arrived in the house a social--social security survivor's payment and also a--a veterans benefit. So there was a small veterans check and a small social security check for me and also for my brother. And for a while she gave us an allowance out of it. Maybe two dollars a month.  But--but it was an allowance.  And when times got tough she stopped giving us the allowance. And so when I went to work my thought was, well if you're not giving me any--the--an allowance I'll raise my own money.  And when she discovered that I was making money--she didn't really have a good idea of how much 'cause I never really let on, but she knew it was a--some--some money, she insisted that I give her half of everything I earned.  And I didn't think that was right and so I, you know, I didn't go along with it and so she put me out.
Speaker 2: So, where did you go?
Speaker 1: My--my oldest brother [Andre Wickham] was a student at Morgan State University [Baltimore, Maryland]. He--my grandmother had passed away and so he was then on his own.  He had a small apartment in Cherry Hill.  He--it was subsidized housing.  The rent was seven dollars a week, fourteen dollars every two weeks.  We paid the rent every two--bi--bi--bi-monthly, I guess that is, and bi-weekly and I moved in with him. And then my second oldest brother [John Rodney Wickham] was in high school, I think he was in his last year of high school then, and he had--a--a--an--evening and weekend job working in the stock room at Montgomery Wards.  So he moved in.  So now there were the three of us in a two-bedroom apartment and my oldest brother often went off to school and would stay on the campus during the week or near the campus and come home on the weekends.  So he wasn't around very much and my brother who worked at Montgomery Wards worked the eleven to seven shift and he was never home at night, and it was just me and my guys--my friends--my place was the place to hang out and of course everyone thought all kinds of wild and crazy stuff was going on there but basically we sat around playing Tonk, sometimes Bid Whist and eating a lot of ice cream and you know just doing silly stuff that young kids do.  But not nearly as--as wild and crazy as--as others thought.

Speaker 1: And I'd save enough money so that when school started I could catch a bus and go to school.  I had to have at least a dollar a day.  It was thirty-five cents each way on the bus. And I'd have about thirty cents for lunch when I got to school and that worked for a while but I went to City College [Baltimore City College, Baltimore, Maryland] my first year of high school.  Now that's kind of strange--City College is not really a college.  In Baltimore, City College was then and is now one of the most prestigious high schools in the mid-Atlantic region.  It along with Baltimore Polytechnic Institute [Baltimore, Maryland] were both all male high schools. And City College was located next to Eastern High School [Baltimore, Maryland], which was an all female high school and Polytechnic was located next to Western High School [Baltimore, Maryland] which was an all female high school.  So there was--and it was a little bit later in life, after--long after I left high school--there was an overlapping because kids were allowed to take classes in either building but basic--basically they were primarily all one gender or another.  and I got to high school and it was a tough curriculum.  It was tough.  Most of the Jewish kids still attended City High School--or City College and it was just a tough curriculum.  and if you if you got other things on your mind--if you got other problems in your life--it wasn't a good place to be and it certainly wasn't for me.  I remember the precipitating event as they call it in the movie industry occurred one day when I had some kind of run in with a teacher and he was my homeroom teacher in fact.  He--he was my homeroom teacher but he was also one of my subject matter teachers and I want to say it was math.  He taught me math.  But the important point is that he was my homeroom teacher and he said to me, "Go home and don't come back until you bring your mother," and I thought well of all people, my homeroom teacher should know that I don't have a mother to bring to school.  And so I took him for his word.  I left and I didn't come back because I didn't have a mother to bring back.  My brother, Andre [Wickham], my oldest brother, who himself had graduated from City College with academic honors, at some point discovered that I had not been attending class and was near the end of the semester and he took me back to school and tried to get me back in, and the principal said simply "I think that DeWayne should use this time to try to find another school, because he will not be coming back to City College and I sat out the rest of the academic year.  Didn't go back in the spring.  I went back to Woodholme, the Country Club, and earned a good income and became even better known to the members because I was there a lot, and in the summer--in the following summer I applied to George Washington Carver High School [Baltimore, Maryland].  Went out for the football team in fact.  You know, we had summer practice and thought I'd made the team until the coach called me over one day and said I had to go to the office  I went over to the office and the principal was there and she had my records from City College and she told me that no one with my behavioral problems would be admitted to Carver High School, and so I was not allowed to come into Carver, we went over to Edmondson High School [today, Edmondson-Westside High School, Baltimore, Maryland]--my brother who had a lot of contacts in the education circles--took me over to Edmondson High School, which was a fairly new high school on the west side of town, and I sat around Edmondson High School for a day or two until my records got there--actually longer than that.  School started and I was at Edmondson for maybe a week or two before my records got to Edmondson and when my records got to Edmondson, I'm not sure what was in there--the record behind that one confrontation that I had with the teacher, when we passed words and he eventually told me to go home and come back with my mother--but they said at Edmondson that I could not remain there.  And so then finally they took me to Frederick Douglass High School [Baltimore, Maryland] where I was allowed to enter after some some time.
