Story_ID: 238495
Speaker 1: We're gonna begin the interview by essentially studying or exploring your early family background.  Can you tell me about your mother, her name, and where was she born?
Speaker 2: My mother's name is Mildred Jackson Shackelford, and she was born in Houston, Texas.
Speaker 1: And did she grow up there?
Speaker 2: Yes, she did.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what do you know about her background and her growing up?
Speaker 2: Not much.  My mother was one of three girls, and their mother [Mary Agnes Murphy] worked in private homes.  And so they often had to work with their mother.  Sometimes they lived on the property, and then again they had, you know, a rental house that they lived in.  My mother's two sisters, she was the baby of the three, had no inclination to go to college, they were satisfied to, to take a course in beauty culture, to be beauticians.  So they felt that, since my mother was the youngest and more aggressive and had been an A student, that they would find a way to get her into college.  So she went to Wiley College in Marshall, Texas.  And she did very well.  She was a cheerleader.  It was there that she met my father [Lee Lewis].  She did graduate in August of 19, she graduated in June of 1930 but I was born in August of 1930.  So she was what we would call today an unwed mother.
Speaker 1: How would you describe your mother?
Speaker 2: She was a very energetic person, very, very intelligent.  Very vocal, she could express herself about any, any subject matter.  She read a lot and, and she, she was not a loving person.  I didn't grow up with her because when my parents married after I was born, and my father had also attended Wiley College, they didn't stay married very long, so actually my father's mother [Ida Lewis], my grandmother was more of a mama to me and so she reared me.
Story_ID: 238496
Speaker 1: So I didn't see my mother [Mildred Jackson Shackelford] to know who she was until I was thirteen years of age.  And she actually came to the school [Edgar M. Gregory School, Houston, Texas] and when she walked into the classroom, inside of me I knew, it was just something about her, I didn't know what the connection was but when I looked at her, I, I started getting almost a fearful thought of something.  And the teacher, and, of course, in those days everybody knew everybody, we really did, it really took a village to raise a child.  So the teacher knew my mother and, and she apparently held a conversation with her, what she was there for and she said she was there to see me, now mind you I've never seen my mother before, so she went outside the classroom and the teacher said Barbara Jean, Lewis is my, my maiden name is Barbara Jean Lewis [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr. Barbara L. King], so she said Barbara Jean, you need to step outside.  So she stepped outside with me, and my mother said, "I'm your mother."  And I looked at her and I started crying.  And the teacher knowing the family said, "Mildred perhaps you should take Barbara Jean home.  I'll contact the principal and let him know what's going on."  So we lived right across from the, I was in junior high school, it was right across from the school.  And we went home to my grandmother [Ida Lewis], who was very disturbed when she saw my mother, and who called my daddy [Lee Lewis], who came to immediately.  And, and there was a lot of dialogue back and forth with the two of them.  And my daddy did not want me to know who she was.  And my grandmother said, "Well, she's here now, Barbara's met her and if she wants to see her, we need to let her do that."  And so from that moment on, I was able to, she lived on the other side of town, I was able to go and, and visit her on weekends.  And, of course, my father would call and make sure I was coming back, back home.  They didn't have a good parting of the way.  And, and in those days when I was a little girl when, I mean, divorce was not as it is today.  You, you could get, go into a courtroom and get a divorce without even mentioning it, my name was never even brought up in the divorce, so my grandmother who reared me as she said from eight days old, felt like she was my mother.  And when I look back at my life, she really was my mother.
Story_ID: 238497
Speaker 1: So after I got to know my mother [Mildred Jackson Shackelford], I would visit her and shortly after I got to know her, the family moved to Los Angeles [California], that's my, my, my grandmother [Mary Agnes Murphy].  She would never go without her three daughters, she always wanted to keep her girls together.  They were all married, but they all, well my mother had divorced by that time, the gentleman she was with, so they took off and they went to California.  And the first time I went to visit them, the older sister, my Aunt Bertha [ph.] said, "We cannot send for Barbara Jean [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr. Barbara L. King] without sending for her grandmother [Ida Lewis] 'cause that's the only mother she's ever known."  Now she and my grandmother had, had a good time, and they knew each other well, she used to bring clothes and things for me as a baby.  They made the decision, my, see my, my grandmother, my maternal grandmother and, and her two daughters, didn't even know I was in the world.  When they found out I was in the world, then they made the decision that my grandmother should keep me because she worked at home, she was a dressmaker.  They worked in private homes and they couldn't take care of a, a child.  So they eventually moved out and my, my two aunts had a beauty shop, my mother came from college [Wiley College, Marshall, Texas], she worked in the beauty shop, so they all were beauticians.  So when they moved to California, they worked in beauty shops near the home that they lived in on the west side of, of, of Los Angeles.  So I went to see them in the summers and it was a little unpleasant because I would call my grandmother Mama, and my mother didn't like that.  She wanted me to call, acknowledge her as my mother and I would, one day I called her by her name and I said Mildred and she almost knocked me out of the room.  And in, informed "I am your mother; don't you ever call me by my first name."  So I had to be very careful what I said about my grandmother in, in the presence of all them, but my mother was the worst in terms of her feelings of animosity against my grandmother.  But had it not been for my grandmother, I don't know where I would be.  I think my mother was young and a party girl and my father [Lee Lewis] was a party person but he did provide for her and for my grandmother.  So it was, it was a history of a lot of pain for a long time as a young person, trying to, to be the person that knew her mother but couldn't feel her.  I couldn't really, I couldn't really feel, I couldn't really feel her.
Story_ID: 238498
Speaker 1: And it was not until five years before her [King's mother, Mildred Jackson Shackelford] death, I just went through a whole transformation and realized that all the honors, all the awards, and all that I had achieved, had she not birthed me it would never happen.  So I did almost an about face and I realized that I was thankful that she did birth me regardless of how she did it and what happened, I was here because of her.  And when I did that, something changed inside of me and I, I just started loving her.  And as soon as, when I, when that happened, we became the best of friends.  And when I would go to see her, and then she came down with cancer and she had several operations, I would fly out to see her, and be with her.  And the night before she transitioned, we don't use the word die so much now in church, we say transition, we talked on the phone and at that time, she liked the stories and her favorite story was 'The Young and the Restless'.  So I used to look at it when I would travel or something, I'd get a chance, be in a hotel, so I called her, I said, "What happened on 'The Young and the Restless'?"  And she went on to tell me she said I have something I wanted to ask you, I said well call me back, call me back collect, and I will, I, I wanna hear from you.  Well she passed away about 2 or 3 o'clock that morning.  My aunt found her, my Aunt Ruth [ph.] who is still alive, ninety-seven years old, icon if you, she's a phenomenal person.  And I went for the funeral.  The most distressing thing to me about my mother's funeral was that they belonged to a Baptist church in L.A. [Los Angeles, California] over thirty-something years, the minister of that church is a former high school classmate of mine, and he called me before I got there to let me know I could not do my mother's funeral, I could not do the eulogy.  And I said to him, they been in that church thirty-something years, so I, I'm not coming to do eulogy, it's enough for me to come to be, to be there to realize my mother's gone just, just when I'm beginning to know who my mother is, she's gone.  And when I got there, they had a process of having a church member come and help you, you know, write out the funeral program.  And she said, "You know, your mother admired you as a minister, all of us know that you are a reverend and we know how the Baptist church is but you have to be on that program somewhere."  So they put me on the program to acknowledge the cards and the letters.  And I made my statement when I did that.  But that's a pain that that has still, from time to time, I, I think about it.  I didn't have to do a eulogy but just to be recognized as a woman in ministry, which is still a part of our history of, of Baptist churches who, who traditionally will not accept women in ministry.  I can't even go preach at my own church [Antioch Missionary Baptist Church] in Houston, Texas, where I was practically born in the church, because they do not accept women ministers.
Story_ID: 238499
Speaker 1: Were there any stories that she [King's mother, Mildred Jackson Shackelford] shared with you that, that you recall?
Speaker 2: I recall stories from my grandmother [Ida Lewis].  When I got to know my mother really, as I said earlier, it was not a, it was not a easy road at first because see I had been taught almost to hate her.  I mean she was, she was not around when I was, you know, a baby and my grandmother took charge.  And when I think about some of the language patterns I've learned from being a trained social worker, my grandmother was a control addict, and she just controlled me and, and my father [Lee Lewis] until my father made a break from her.  So, to her my, my mother was not a good person because she didn't rear me, she, she reared me.  So, older people back in those days would, would take a child and rear a child and think nothing about it, so it was, it was not uncommon for a grandmother to rear a little girl.  But she, she was the story teller.  She told me things about how her mother, mother's mother was a slave and how they'd pick cotton and how even when, when my father was born she did not, she stayed with my father's father [Tom Lewis] until he was thirteen because he was, in those days you ran on the railroad and my grandfather was a railroad person.  I mean he had a girl in every port, that's what, that's what, what they used to tell us all the time.  And so when she told stories, in fact one story she told, very interesting, she said that when she married my daddy's father, actually her mother was in love with him and kind of pawned her off with him so he would still be around, so there was never a happy relationship there with the two of them because he really was like, he was older, and he was really was liking her mother but her mother for whatever reason didn't wanna marry him.  And so I heard these stories, you know, and, and how, how she worked in private homes so that she and my daddy would have something to eat.
Story_ID: 238500
Speaker 1: And even to the point of when my daddy went to college, she [King's paternal grandmother, Ida Lewis] made all of his clothes, she made his underwear, people used to make clothes out of cotton sacks, flour sacks, flour sack material with the most gorgeous cotton floral prints you've ever seen.  My daddy said he resented wearing these clothes, they would call 'em mammy made clothes, you know.  But he got through school because she made his clothes and sent them to him at college.  He was on scholarship, just like my mother was.  So--
Speaker 2: What is your father's name?
Speaker 1: Hm?
Speaker 2: What is your father's name?
Speaker 1: My father's name was Lee Andrew Lewis.  And that name came from the doctor who delivered him, Dr. Lee [ph.] was the only black doctor in our community.  We didn't have, what we have now, you didn't have back then, you had one black doctor.  You had the school teachers, you had maybe one or two lawyers but in the early '30s [1930s] that did not exist.
Speaker 2: And where was he born?
Speaker 1: In Houston [Texas].  No, he was born in Victoria, Texas.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And the hospital was Andrews Hospital [ph.], and that's where she got the name from.
Speaker 2: And did he ever share any stories with you growing up?
Speaker 1: Not a lot.  He told me one story about how he got to be a motion picture operator.  He never trained for that, showing the movies in the theaters, but he went up, he told me how he went up on the telephone pole one time hooked up the telephone service, you know, for, for he and, and my grandmother, and that somehow when he got a chance to be in a projection booth, he, he just knew instinctively how to operate the projector.  But you have to remember my grandmother was my sole source.  She was everything.  My father was quite a playboy.  He was tall and good looking, women loved him.  So we, we didn't see a lot of him, he was, he would be gone various places.  Very active in the community.  He worked with the sheriff's department, in the juvenile department.  He was a Boy Scout[s of America] person, leader, got the highest award, the Beat Award [ph.] I think it was called.  I don't know if they still do that but he got the highest award.  He was the first African American to integrate a white Catholic church in downtown.  He used go to, he had long since decided that the Baptist was too much for him.  He couldn't drink a beer, he couldn't smoke, and he was (unclear) we didn't go to movies on Sunday, we didn't dance.  And so he went to the Catholic church where he could play some bingo, could have a beer, you know, that kind of thing.  So they weren't around me enough for me to hear stories from them.
Story_ID: 238501
Speaker 1: Everything I heard was from my grandmother [Ida Lewis].  And the things that she went through too, she said she would work for a white family she would say to them, if, when they would give her lunch she would say, "Would you mind if I keep some of this food for my son [King's father, Lee Lewis]?"  And they would say, "No, no, no, Ida, we'll just fix another plate for you to take home to your son."  She told me this story once about my father, she would bake biscuits for breakfast and my daddy would come from school and he would, he would pour out a plate of syrup, this is homemade syrup now, and he would, you know, use the biscuit to sop up the syrup but he would always leave some syrup.  So one day she made him drink all he had left and she didn't have any trouble with him anymore 'cause she felt evidently it was waste, okay.  And she, then she told me how her mother preserved, they put up their preserves during the summer so when winter came, you would just eat out of your pantry.  And the delight for me as a child was when she opened the pantry door and I could see the jars with tomatoes.  I could see the jars with her, her seasonings, her soup mixture.  I could see, she made watermelon rind preserves.  She just, she was a very active, unique person, very aware of things around her.  She had a garden out in the yard, we grew our own greens, and we called 'em snap beans, you all call 'em green beans, it was snap beans and squash.  So we often picked vegetables from the garden.  And what we didn't pick from the garden, the vegetable man would come down the street and he would say, get your fresh vegetables right here.  The ice man would come down the street, 'cause we had an icebox, and I would see them bring, get fifty pounds of ice to go in the icebox.  So I remember those things very vividly.  And she was always telling me that, what we were going through in terms of segregation, would not always be.  She said it will not be this way always, and you have to decide what you're gonna do and be and know that the Lord will make a way somehow.  That was always her word, the Lord will make a way somehow.  And so she, she sewed for people and that's how she made her living.  That's why I was the best dressed girl in, in school.
Story_ID: 238502
Speaker 1: On both sides of the family, they were not touching people.  It was, when I achieved, I was rewarded for achievement.  I was an A student so I always got a reward but never the hug, never the real pat on the back, never, never the words, I'm proud of you.  At my church [Antioch Missionary Baptist Church, Houston, Texas] I, I got a lot of recognition but the family members were kind of, they were kind of, they were just, I don't, I don't know how to explain it.
Speaker 2: What types of rewards would they give you?
Speaker 1: Well, my grandmother [Ida Lewis] would either make me something new to wear or I could, one time I came home went to my bedroom I fell over a desk.  She had had the desk in layaway, in those days everything was layaway, and she had the desk and she got the desk into my room, so I'd have a desk to study at.  My mother [Mildred Jackson Shackelford], same thing, it was always some clothes or my Aunt Bertha [ph.] would take me to Disneyland or something in [Anaheim] California.  I, we, I, I, I can drive California now 'cause she went so many places, Knott's Berry Farm [Buena Park, California], whatever was there.  She was a person that felt you should know everything educational 'cause she had a day care center in their home, she kept children and they took trips and tours.  And then when she stopped the day care center, she worked with senior citizens in their church and around a certain region in, in L.A. [Los Angeles, California] and they were always going to Las Vegas [Nevada].  It was exciting for senior citizens to get on the bus and go and gamble in Vegas.  They'd give you all these little free tickets for a free breakfast and so they would mostly hang out downtown, they were not always on the strip, the casino downtown did more for seniors.
Story_ID: 238503
Speaker 1: How far back can you trace your ancestors?
Speaker 2: Not very far.  I, I--my grandmother [Ida Lewis] never talked about it very much.  My Aunt Ruth [ph.] who is still alive, who's ninety-seven, said that we came from Crowley, Louisiana on my mother's [Mildred Jackson Shackelford] side.  And, and that we were all extremely tall, we were always tall.  People knew the Jacksons and whatever other names were in that family.  So I didn't grow up with the family reunions.  I'm an only child, my mother had two sisters, they had no children.  I'm the only child that she and my daddy [Lee Lewis] had.  So I never knew a family reunion, and just as I said, grew up with a grandmother who was all encompassing.  And I've tried to think of some things my mother, but they didn't, they were not storytellers.  Mama was the one that would tell you different things like the, about her mother and the slaveries, and the working in the cotton field and, and how she met my grandfather and she married him, and her mother's situation with him, which could be a good soap opera (laughter).  But I'm just a, I'm an only child.  I marvel now at people who have large families because I didn't have that.  I was just right in that nest with her except to get out to go visit my mother.  My daddy would come home periodically, said he was a playboy, and that's kind of my history.
Speaker 1: And so (unclear) your grandmother, what about your grandfather?
Speaker 2: I never met him.  He died before I was born.  I did not (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And what was his name?
Speaker 2: His name was Tom Lewis--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --on my daddy's side.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: My mother's daddy, I didn't meet him either, he would, he died.  And that, that's, and see there were no other children, nobody had any children, you know, so it makes for a real situation.
Story_ID: 238504
Speaker 1: What's your earliest memory of growing up?
Speaker 2: Well, I remember my first and only birthday party until I was grown, is when I was six.  My grandmother [Ida Lewis] managed to do a lot of sewing and she had some extra money and she gave me this one birthday party.  And one of my gifts was a scooter, and when I see kids talking about scooters now, I laugh, 'cause that was back in 1936 when I was six and I got this scooter and I was up and down the street on the scooter.  And then for Christmas she got me some skates.  She was the sole source of, of everything that I was.  My father [Lee Lewis] would forget to bring money to get my shoes for Easter, because when he would come with some money to get 'em, all the shoes were picked over and I was tall, I had a, we wore Buster Brown shoes, so by the time I got there, I had to buy some brown or white oxford looking shoes, I didn't have the pretty little sandals or whatever.  But I, I remember that birthday party.  You know, for a long time I actually had a slice of cake.  My grandmother believed in keeping things.  She had a slice of cake in a little shoe box from that party, wrapped in a napkin.  She had my first bonnet that she made for me to wear, my first dress, my first gloves, they were mittens with your fingers out.  I mean that's, that's exciting for me, I, I can picture that right now.  And I had it for a long time, and I lived in a house in Atlanta [Georgia] and it flooded and all those things got washed away.  But that that birthday party was exciting.  The next thing I remember is when I bought by first bicycle.  I had literally begged my daddy for a bicycle and he would always say I'm gone bring you one.  And so finally my first year as a freshman at Texas [Southern University, Houston, Texas], well then Texas State University [for Negroes, Houston, Texas], it's now Texas Southern, I bought a bicycle.  I had worked and saved my money.  And I rode my bicycle across town, from a section we lived in called Fourth Ward to Third Ward, and I'd pass the same working people going to work in their cars and we would wave and talk and they'd say, "How you doing? How's the bicycle?"  "Fine."  And I rode that bicycle all the way to college.  Every year for one, every day for one year that I went to school I was on that bicycle.  And it was just, it was, it was wonderful.
Story_ID: 238505
Speaker 1: How were holidays and special events in your family?  Is there or were there any holidays that are especially significant to you or that you recall?
Speaker 2: Well, again, holidays were me and Mama [King's paternal grandmother, Ida Lewis].  One of the things I remember very much, this is not quite a holiday but it will fit in, I believe, is that in the wintertime we played games.  We played checkers, we played dominoes, there was a card game called old maid and I was always the old maid, I don't know how she managed it but I know she was always went out on that one, and we played games.  And my grandmother made her own, we called it soda pop in Texas, so she made her own drink, we never bought any strawberry or root beer drinks from the drugstore, she made her own drinks.  And she made a, her fruitcakes so that by the winter time we would, at Christmas we would have the fruitcake.  And she'd give you a little glass, a little taste of wine that she made, she made her own grape wine.  So holidays were days at home with Mama, around a wooden stove, a old potbelly stove that I learned to, to break up wood to light that fire, I learned how to light a fire.  I can do a marvelous fireplace 'cause I did it in the stove.  We didn't cook on that stove but we used the stove, it was just for heating.  So holidays for me were with Mama.  My daddy [Lee Lewis] would probably be out of town some place.  My mother [Mildred Jackson Shackelford] lived in another state.  And when I would go to California in the summers because I was there for the summer, when my birth, my birthday's August 26th, so there was always a birthday party, my mother always gave me a party and all the kids I knew at the church [Antioch Missionary Baptist Church, Houston, Texas] that we all attended would come to the party.  But as far as Thanksgiving dinners around the table and Christmas, no, I didn't have any of that.
Story_ID: 238506
Speaker 1: Yeah, that song 'Just the Two of Us,' it was just the two of us.  So my life revolved around her [King's paternal grandmother, Ida Lewis], and her life revolved around the church.
Speaker 2: Hmm.
Speaker 1: She was a church woman.  She went, she taught in the Sunday school, she taught in the BYPU, it was the Baptist Young People's Union [of America].  She sang in the choir.  And so at our church there was someone going on almost every day during the week.  We went to mission meeting, Sunday school teacher's meeting, well I went with her to everything.  And that was my early beginnings in the ministry because I was with her all the time.  So I had a chance to, to really be as a child in an adult situation where I was learning and very much aware of what, what was being taught.
Story_ID: 238507
Speaker 1: So at fifteen I gave my first, and I say it was my first sermon, they didn't wanna call it that but we, in the Baptist church we had in those days what was called Woman Day [sic. Women's Day], some still do this.  And the women raised money for the church on Women's Day, so they sometimes, they start a year in advance having different projects that lead up to the fundraising.  And they decided that year to let me speak in the night service where we didn't have a lot, people would be packed in church at eleven o'clock but they didn't always come back for the seven o'clock service, so they put me on at night.  And much to all of our surprise, the people turned out to hear Barbara Lewis [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr. Barbara L. King].  And they used to call me, Little Missionary, and it was spoken that nobody could say I'd be a minister but they said I'd be a missionary.  And I spoke, so that was, I feel that was my first sermon.
Speaker 2: And what was the content?
Speaker 1: I don't remember, I wished I could.  Yes I do, yes I do.  I had a, a knack of seeing beyond the scriptures.  I, I always felt there was a hidden message.  I didn't know anything about the Jewish people.  We studied the Bible intensely but I always felt there was something else beneath those scriptures.  And I did a message on what is in your hand.  And I went into the Bible and I found something about everybody who used their hand.  You know, Moses used his hand with the rod and to lead the, the children of Israel out of Egypt.  And, and I don't know, David had a staff in his hand.  David also used the three stones to slay the, Goliath the Giant.  And everywhere I could find something that related to a hand and a Bible character, I brought it out.  And I, my, my message was that your hand is really just a physical instrument but within your hand is a spiritual meaning because you're using your hand to bring about something good in someone's life but you can also use that hand to bring about something evil in someone's life.  That's that was my message at fifteen.  After I did that message, one of the mission societies asked me to come and teach, and here I was teaching women who were 40, 50, 60 years old.  And they would give me a little offering for coming.  Now remember, it was just me and my [paternal] grandmother [Ida Lewis], so I started working when I was thirteen.  I was baby-sitting for thirty cents an hour.  I had worked since, I have actually worked since I was thirteen up until this present moment.  And so they would give you a little offering; that would be to encourage the young person.
Story_ID: 238508
Speaker 1: And when I was getting ready to finish high school [Booker T. Washington High School, Houston, Texas], I said to my minister [at Antioch Missionary Baptist Church, Houston, Texas], "I want to be a minister."  He said, "What?"  I said, "That's been in my heart, that's what I've always seen, when I look at you on Sundays, I see myself in the pulpit."  He said, "Barbara [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr. Barbara L. King] there's no way you can be a minister.  God didn't call women to preach.  You can be a missionary but you can't be a minister and you will never be a minister in the Baptist church."
Speaker 2: What did that mean to you at that point (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) It was very devastating because I was so spiritually inclined and I knew that was my calling, and, and, and, you know, and the Baptists talk about you had a calling, you were called to preach.  And I knew in my spirit, in my whole being that's what I wanted to be, and he stopped me.  And he said, "Well, we, we'll get you in to be a missionary."  I said, "No I don't wanna be a missionary, I want to be a minister."  He said, "Well I tell you what, choose your next best thing."  And, of course, my next best thing was social work, no it was physical education 'cause I was very physical.  I wasn't a basketball player, we didn't, we didn't play basketball like kids do today.  We did a lot of volleyball.  We did a lot of track.  But I was not interested in sports but that seemed to be the next thing that I, that I should do because everybody said you tall you should be in sports.
Story_ID: 238509
Speaker 1: So I went to college [Texas State University for Negroes; Texas Southern University, Houston, Texas] and I had a major in physical education for almost two years.  And the second year I became very ill and I had tuberculosis in both lungs.  The doctors gave me up, but they put me in a tuberculum sanitarium.  And I lived in that sanitarium four years with other young people and middle age people and all levels.  And in those days because of segregation, we lived in barracks, [U.S.] Army barracks, we didn't live in the main building with other patients but blacks lived in the other and we converted Army barracks.  And so we would, on each end there was a living room in the middle, and on each end there were ten beds, five beds facing each other.  And they did some surgery on my, they did what they call a lobectomy, they went in and took a portion of my lung out so they could relax my lungs.  So in those days if you had tuberculosis, rest was all they could do, there was no medication that they could give you.  And finally, there was something called SAS [ph.] tablets and they gave 'em to us three times a day, there were nine tablets, they were huge tablets, you had to swallow 'em, and that was the newest med, medicine for tuberculosis.  The rest of the time we was supposed to be on straight best rest.  Well I was an active person, I was running around.  And even in that tuberculum sanitarium, I was ministering to people.  For some reason, I'm the one that read the Bible, I was the one to do the 23rd Psalms.  So when someone was dying, they said go get Barbara [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr. Barbara L. King], and I'd go from one end of the building, so I'd watch people just go to the other side while I was saying the 23rd Psalms.  And when they did the surgery, one morning I was looking, listening to a minister on, on the radio, now you have to remember the Baptist church, we didn't believe in laying on of hands and talking and speaking in tongue, all those things were not a part of our tradition at that time, it's changed now.  And I heard this minister say, put your hand on the radio and you will be healed, well, I know now, it was an act of faith, the radio didn't have nothing to do it.  But I did put my hand on it, 'cause I wanted to go, I wanted to go back and finish up my college work, I wanted to go to school.  And when I did that, a voice within me said, your lungs look like they did before, before you got sick.  And I said, no way.  And my, my seat, my room, the woman across from me her bed reached mine, she said what, who are you talking to?  I said, oh nothing, you know.  And three months later, a doctor came into the ward, sent for me, showed me my x-rays, and what had happened was my right lung had expanded out like a whole lung and the three ribs that they clipped had reconnected.  He said we have known that we couldn't keep you here but, but it's a phenomenal thing.  He gave me some medical name that said I wouldn't survive, this is something that just could happen, and then just, just, disintegrate in a matter of a minute, but we have to let you go, so they discharged me.  I came home in June, and by September I was back in college.
Story_ID: 238510
Speaker 1: I begged the, the guy at the registration office to, to give me some money and he said he couldn't do it, and finally he found some money which paid for my tuition and my books and I went back to Texas Southern [Texas State University for Negroes; Texas Southern University, Houston, Texas].  And I worked in private homes and I, I mopped the floors in the school, I was a maid in Texas Southern.  And I did three years of college in two years, graduated with honors with more awards than any student had ever won in the history of Texas Southern University in 1955.  And I came to Atlanta [Georgia] on a wing and a prayer.  I didn't know how I was gone make it.  I had one month's room and board, I had a part tuition scholarship, and I had a $150 my daddy's [Lee Lewis] union had given me, and I came to Atlanta to Atlanta University [Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia].  They were gonna put me out in October 'cause I didn't have any more room and board, and my sorority, Zeta Phi Beta Sorority, somebody got to the grand basileus, which would be the president, and she called a conference call, and they gave me five hundred dollars and that kept me until the anniversary of my first year.  So they never had a chance to put me out.
Story_ID: 238511
Speaker 1: I'd like to rewind a bit and ask a couple of other questions about what was going on in your earlier years.  Do you remember what street you lived on?
Speaker 2: 317 Solidare [ph.].
Speaker 1: And do you recall anything about the community that you were living in?  Were there any people in particular that you remember?
Speaker 2: Well, there was a family, we lived on the side of the street with the best houses, and when I say the best houses we had two bedrooms, we had a large hallway that we could use for a living room.  There was a breakfast room off in the kitchen which was, was my playroom.  And there was a huge dining room and then we had the bathtub and didn't have a shower but we had a tub in the bathroom.  People across the street from us were in the shotgun houses.  And there were one or two houses on the block that were like rooming houses, which was very popular then, rooming houses were very popular, people would rent a room, you know, in a huge home.  And there was another gentleman on the street they called Fat Baby [ph.].  And Fat Baby was supposed to be gay, now we didn't use the word gay then, I mean he was called a sissy.  And the, the grown people tell you, don't, don't go, don't ever go, my mama [King's paternal grandmother, Ida Lewis] say don't ever go in Fat Baby's house, now you pass by there.  He sat on the porch, he was a real husky guy.  And he would speak to all the children.  We all knew him.  He would speak to all of us.  But we would see men going in and out but nobody really understood, we didn't know anything about, the terminology that used now, we just knew that was Fat Baby and he was, he was a sissy, he was different, nobody ever questioned what a sissy was, nobody said anything that, that opened us up.  So the neighborhood was quite diverse.  The, the family across from me that I remember the most had a, had a lot, they had like ten or twelve kids and they lived in a shotgun house, one, two, three rooms but they all were in there, and they were my closest friends.  As I said before, I could not leave my front porch without asking my grandmother's permission, everybody else would run up and down the street.  There was one family on the same side of the street we were, where the daughter came, the mother died when they were young and the, the dad was trying to rear the son and daughter and she got pregnant, that was the talk of the neighborhood so and so and so is pregnant.  So then my grandmother said if you get pregnant, I'll kill you.  And, of course, I believed her because she was just that strong.  But it was a wonderful neighborhood.  And we lived within spitting distance of the school.  The high school [Booker T. Washington High School, Houston, Texas] that I went to was both junior and senior, it was a combination, and I could walk out of my front door and, and make five steps, I was on the campus.  My grandma said when I, when, when we would be outside playing baseball or something she'd always hear my mouth, I can always hear your mouth more than anybody else's, you know.  So it was, it was an exciting neighborhood.  It was also a neighborhood where, when it rained, it was not, it was not a paved street and we lived on a muddy street.  And we lived very close to downtown.  You could walk to downtown from where we lived in Houston [Texas] in ten minutes.  You go there now there are condominiums, there's everything, that neighborhood has just been wiped out.  But we could walk to downtown.  So my grandma would send me to Woolworth[s] to buy items she needed for her sewing, whether it was thread or snaps or whatever dress item she needed, I could go there.  And there were Italian grocery stores we called them dagos.  So we had one, one on one corner, there was one of them where we used to (unclear) near into the downtown area.  Then if we really had some money, mama would send me to get some, there's a fish called gaspergou.  And one time I went to ask for gaspergou and I asked for mushpergoo [ph.], and the guy said is that what your mama told you?  And I said yes, sir.  He sent me back home.  She said girl I told you to get gaspergou not mushpergoo.  It's a favorite fish apparently in Houston for that, I don't know if it's still a fish that they eat now.  So it was a very diverse neighborhood in a way.  There was one, one office building in the neighborhood.  In that office building that was housed a beauty shop, a training school for beauticians, I worked in that office building.  I worked for Atlanta Life Insurance Company [Atlanta Life Financial Group, Atlanta, Georgia].  I would get up at five, walk in the dark to that office building which was around the corner from my house, catch the elevator, go to the floor that, that Atlanta Life was on, clean all the desks, empty all the waste baskets every morning.  I got five dollars a week.
Story_ID: 238512
Speaker 1: In those early years do you recall the name of your elementary school?
Speaker 2: Gregory, Gregory Elementary School [Edgar M. Gregory School, Houston, Texas].
Speaker 1: Do you recall any of your teachers or anyone who influenced you in that setting?
Speaker 2: There was one teacher Miss White [ph.] who really influenced me a lot, but all my teachers did.  It was a different, it was a different thing.  Remember, the people who taught me were also my Sunday school teachers.  It was really a village.  So you knew everybody, everybody knew my parents [Mildred Jackson Shackelford and Lee Lewis], they knew my mother, they knew my father, knew my grandmother [Ida Lewis].  So you would see them in class, then you turn around and see 'em on Sundays in Sunday school.  So it was, it was a different kind of combination.  Everybody was encouraging you to be somebody.
Story_ID: 238513
Speaker 1: And when you were growing up, do you recall any of the sights, the sounds, or the smells of your neighborhood?
Speaker 2: Well, when the children were out playing, we'd come in after school, it was a very, very busy place.  The noise of children running up and down the streets.  Everybody with their favorite toy.  There was a great sharing of food.  We would come out on Mondays and somebody would say, what did you have for dessert yesterday?  And they'd say I had, we had cake.  What did you have?  Well my grandmother [Ida Lewis] was a great pie, we had lemon pie.  Well I said, would you give me some of your pie, I'll give you some of my cake.  Well see I, I couldn't give it to anyone, so I had sneak in the house, turn the water on like I was washing my hands, my mama said what you doing?  I'm just washing my hands.  Ease the icebox door open, bring out the pie, slice a little piece, put it on a napkin, put it back in the refrigerator, and say okay I'm done, I'm back outside, don't be out there to long, and back out I would go.  But those were fun days.  I had, I could steal up a storm 'cause I wanted, I didn't wanna be, not be in the mix with everybody else.  So, 'cause we, it was a grace, and mama never baked a cake, so if somebody came over with chocolate cake or pound cake or something, I was glad to get a piece of cake (laughter).
Speaker 1: That was something she wasn't making.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and if you played with me, you had to come in my doll house.  You didn't play on the porch.  I had a tea set, the table, the chairs, and a set of dishes with the tea dishes that some white family gave it to my grandmother, and they were very good dishes.  I didn't realize what I was doing when we played, having tea.  I loved dolls and I had big dolls and, and mama dressed all my dolls.  She never taught me to sew 'cause she was the great sewer but my dolls were well-dressed.  So you had to come in and play, play in my house.
Story_ID: 238514
Speaker 1: And what about middle school?  Did you have elementary, middle, and then high (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, no, no--
Speaker 1: --or elementary straight to high school?
Speaker 2: --we had elementary, junior, and high [at Edgar M. Gregory School, Houston, Texas].  The junior high was on the, was on the ground level.  We didn't go upstairs until we got to high school.
Speaker 1: And what kind of student were you?
Speaker 2: I was an A student.  I was an aggressive student.  If you had told me to do, I remember this, so well.  In biology we were doing a, a kind of a, a notebook.  I went outside and, and got all the leaves, different leaves off the trees, my [paternal] grandmother [Ida Lewis] helped me to name the leaves what was an elm tree, 'cause she knew all the trees.  I always went the extra mile.  I never turned a report without something attached to it that helped to further clarify the report.  That's just the way I thought.  So I was an A student.  I didn't have much of a social life because I had to come home after school.  So I didn't have, I couldn't hang out that, you know, that kind of thing.
Speaker 1: And there were no extracurricular activities you were participating in?
Speaker 2: Other than church and the show, we went to the show.  The show changed, the same movie was on Sunday, Monday, another movie Tuesday, Wednesday, then Thursday and Friday, or Friday and Saturday was the cowboy.  That was always the cowboy movie.  So we went, we went to the show.  Now I used to get beat up when I was in elementary school, I used to get beat up all the time 'cause I was, I was Miss Smarty Pants.  The kids would look at me and, and bat their eyes and tell me three o'clock because I'm the one the teacher called on to read, I'm the best reader.  You know, I'm, I just, I just knew everything, you know.  Then my grandmother would send up some flowers or something to the teacher.  She knew the teachers, they all knew each other.  And the kids say why is she bringing flowers in here and bringing food to the teacher.  So they would beat me up every day after school.  I used to have to run home.
Story_ID: 238515
Speaker 1: So one day I went to the theater to see my daddy [Lee Lewis], I went upstairs 'cause my daddy would check my homework, and he said, he said, he called me Lizzy Ann [ph.] I don't know where that name came from, I hated it. But he said, "Lizzy Ann, I want you to go down stairs and go to the confectioner's and get me," he said, "two El Ropo cigars."  And that's the way I heard it, and it may have been another name, he called them El Ropo cigars.  I went down asked the guy for the cigars, I said, "I don't have any money."  He said, "You don't need any money."  I said, "Why don't I need some money?"  He said, "Your daddy has an account."  Well, that was my salvation from getting beat up.  I told all my little buddies you, and then I found out I had take 'em, and I asked the manager could I bring 'em to the show, he said, "You can bring anybody you want, you can bring in three, your daddy works here."  So I got my little group that beat me up all the time, brought 'em to the confection area, got 'em all hot dogs, and everything and then got 'em in the show free.  I became the star in my elementary school days [at Edgar M. Gregory School, Houston, Texas].  And when my daddy went to pay his bill, I was really a star 'cause when he got home, man he put on my knees and took off his belt and wore me out.  He wore out me out so bad because when he went to pay his bill, it took all of his salary, he wasn't making but twenty or thirty dollars a week as a motion picture operator.
Speaker 2: Was it common for him to discipline you or was it only in that extreme incident?
Speaker 1: That was the extreme incident but he disciplined me all the time.  In fact, after that whooping, my grandmother [Ida Lewis] said I won't let him whoop you anymore, I'll just have to try to punish you.  She said because he was, he was, but see that was his whole salary gone, he was, I mean, it was just, you go to get your money and your, your child has run up your bill and you have no money coming.  That was the worst thing I had done to my father.
Speaker 2: And were the friendships that you were able to get (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) They stopped beating me up after school.
Speaker 2: --from sharing all of those--
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, they stopped beating me up after school, praise the Lord for that--
Story_ID: 238516
Speaker 1: I mean I would run up on people's porches, you know.  See in those days they put a chip on your shoulder, pick up a piece of wood and they'd say, "Knock the chip off," but you weren't gone knock it off 'cause, you know, that meant the fight was supposed to start.  So somebody in the group would knock it off and they would just, they'd come and get you.  And see I was a Christian and my grandma [Ida Lewis] said Christians don't fight.  So I had my hands up like this and three or four of 'em would attack me at one time.  Sometimes people would come out and just say leave that child alone.  They would come out, and out of their homes and that's the going back to the village to somebody saw something happening, they would come out, I got saved many a day.  And I had a long way to walk to go to elementary school [Edgar M. Gregory School, Houston, Texas], it was a shorter walk when I got to high school [Booker T. Washington High School, Houston, Texas] but from elementary school I, we must have walked ten miles or more.
Speaker 2: And who were your friends (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) No school buses.
Speaker 2: --did you have any play friends?
Speaker 1: I had friends but nobody came, no we had a, a girl called Moody [ph.].  And Moody couldn't have been over five feet tall and she also carried a knife.  And she had her own little gang and you just didn't mess with Moody, everybody was scared of Moody, she controlled a lot of folk.
Speaker 2: And was she your friend or your enemy?
Speaker 1: No, she was it, she was very jealous of my abilities, that's all it was.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And one time, they divided up, I was with all the A students and they divided, they decided to put some of the A students in with the, with the students who had a lower grade level, and that's where we got our punishment.
Story_ID: 238517
Speaker 1: And so you were primarily spending time between school and church.  At that time--
Speaker 2: That's all.
Speaker 1: --did you know of any other passions that you wanted to pursue in your life other than the ministry?
Speaker 2: No.  In the summers I went to the Y [YWCA, Young Women's Christian Association] camp, and I had to work to go to camp.  I had to get a scholarship for camp.  That was my sole heart's desire.  When I, when I came out of the [tuberculosis] sanitarium and I went back to college [at Texas State University for Negroes; Texas Southern University, Houston, Texas], then I changed to sociology to be a social worker because the person who had most helped me in the sanitarium was a social worker who helped me to really realize it's okay you're gonna be here.  Oh, I begged them to get me a king-sized bed.  I can't sleep in this little bed.  I'm finding, I tried to find every way I could get out of that hospital.  And she helped me to settle down and realize you're here to get well, it's okay.  'Cause I saw so many people dying I just, but I always knew I was gonna go back to college.
Story_ID: 238518
Speaker 1: Did you have any idea how you, how you had gotten the tuberculosis?
Speaker 2: No.  And what was interesting, they, the doctors talked to my, both my parents [Mildred Jackson Shackelford and Lee Lewis] 'cause my mother came, they could not trace it.  To this day it couldn't be traced to nobody, nowhere in the family.  They think it came from pneumonia and I, my immune system was down.  And with, and I did have pneumonia because when I had got to college I start wearing strapless shoes.  And, and Texas Southern [Texas State University for Negroes; Texas Southern University, Houston, Texas] was a new institution because Heman [Marion] Sweatt was the person that sued to get into University of Texas [at Austin School of Law, Austin, Texas], and to keep a black man running University of Texas, they built Texas State University and it was out in the cotton field, open field.  We had one, one administration building, the rest of the, those, those [U.S.] Army barracks.  And we used to walk in the mud.  And my [paternal] grandmother [Ida Lewis] had always said when I got to college I stopped take caring of myself, 'cause see before she, but I was eighteen and she could demand that I do this, do this, do that.  I said, no I'm a wear my little heels and my little shoes out and, of course, you used to take off some of your clothes and you used to wearing more clothes.  And she, she was real upset about that but I was in college now you just don't, you know, and she still didn't give me a door key.  I had to, I had to, had to ring the bell to get in the house at night.  So that meant I was gon' be in there early.
Story_ID: 238519
Speaker 1: When you were in college you were still living with your grandmother [Ida Lewis]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, because, because I couldn't live on campus [at Texas State University for Negroes; Texas Southern University, Houston, Texas].  There were no dormitories at that time.  You had to, you had to live off-campus.  And once, and then remember I had no social life, I didn't date 'cause everybody, in high school [Booker T. Washington High School, Houston, Texas] the guys was scared of my daddy [Lee Lewis] he was so tall and, you know, weren't nobody gone date, date 'cause Barbara Jean's [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr. Barbara L. King] daddy, honey, he will get you, you know.  And he hung out with the kids.  I remember, I went to see Ray Charles, I didn't realize we were the same age when he just died recently.  So this been, when I went to see Ray Charles at 18 or 17, whatever, 18 or so, he was only that, he was that age too.  And my grandmother sneaked me to the civic center to see Ray Charles, 'cause they didn't have, it was a black, it had to be either a black event or a white event.  So my grandmother sneaked me in there, she gave me the money to go in and I had sit up in the balcony so I, my daddy wouldn't see me.  My daddy was dancing with all my girlfriends.  I was, all my classmates were having a ball with my daddy.  He was just so, so, you know, he was just an all-around person.  And he was active in the, in the alumni association.  He came to the school all the time.  If there was a prom, he'd provide the lighting, he'd get it from the theater.  And I was so upset but I couldn't even go down on the floor and dance, and so I just sat there and enjoyed Ray Charles and I said, you know, a sit down concert.  Then I had to get out early to walk back home so he wouldn't see me.
Story_ID: 238520
Speaker 1: That quest for the ministry just didn't end.  And so when I went back to college [Texas State University for Negroes; Texas Southern University, Houston, Texas] with the major in social work, that was the closest thing I could find to working with people.  And when I finished college, before I finished I met Whitney Young who was the dean of [School of Social Work; Whitney M. Young Jr. School of Social Work at] Atlanta University [Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia] at the time.  He, Atlanta University [AU] and New York [University School of Social Work; Silver School of Social Work at NYU, New York, New York] was the, considered the two top social worker schools in the country.  He said Barbara [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr. Barbara L. King] don't come unless you got some money.  I said I'm coming to AU, I've heard you and I, I really wanna be in the school that you're a dean at.  And that's how I came on here.  And finished up the social work degree, went to live in Chicago [Illinois], and did social work for thirteen years but all during that time everything I did was related to the church.  If it wasn't on my job, it was related to the church.  'Til I final saw a woman minister [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr. Johnnie Colemon] that, that was my mentor and let me know I could be a minister too.
Story_ID: 238521
Speaker 1: And what were some of the earlier agencies that you worked with as a social worker?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I started out with, they used to call Firman House [Firman Community Services] in Chicago [Illinois].  It was on the West Side of Chicago.  And I worked there for a while.  Then I went to another, these were all settlement houses.  Settlement houses are like community centers, they serve from the preschool through to the senior citizen.  Settlement houses began during the early years when people migrated to America, they couldn't speak English so they started Hull House [Chicago, Illinois] and other, there was Jane Addams' house, so that that the immigrants could have some place to learn English, learn how to adapt to American life and that sort of stuff, and they just continued to be in existence, and still became a center of activities for people in the neighborhood.  So I went to one called Henry Booth House [Chicago, Illinois] that was a housing project in Chicago.  And I left there and I went to one further south out by the steel mills called South Chicago [Chicago, Illinois].  And it was in that area that I became director of three agencies, one was Hispanic, mostly Hispanic families, and one was mostly, I would say people of Russian and Slavic background, and then, and then the blacks, they all lived in that area.  These were people that worked in the steel mill.  And I became director of those three agencies.  And then I left there and I went to what was then Crane Junior College [Malcolm X College, Chicago, Illinois] and I went there as director of community, community development.  And at that college, while I was there it had had a, it had all white faculty and administration but the student body was, you know, 'cause the community a lot of blacks coming from the Mississippi and Alabama, they were migrating to Chicago and they were here in that West Side.  So the, the white families are moving out and the blacks were coming in so those, the student body was practically all black and they were really raising Cain with the chancellor of the Chicago city college [City Colleges of Chicago] system about getting some blacks on the staff and I was the first one they brought in.  And did a lot of work, had a chance to really know, I can't think of the, the group now, the Black Panthers [Black Panther Party] some of them were on campus.  One of those men is now an outstanding congressman out of Chicago who was a Black Panther.  And--
Speaker 1: What is his name?
Speaker 2: Oh, he, he's a congressman.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Rush.
Speaker 2: Yeah, [HistoryMaker Bobby] Rush, right.
Speaker 1: Bobby Rush.
Speaker 2: Yes.  And we, and when he saw me he remembered me.  They met in my house once, I didn't, I didn't even know the extent of what they, you know, what they were about at the time.  But my job was to make sure that the black students were getting to the point they could be at peace and they began bringing black, you know teachers but they didn't have any, it was just a all-white institution.  And Crane was named for the Crane family, those were the people did all of the, the, toilet supplies and things like that.  So it was, it was a great institution.  And the students wanted me to be the president when they really started shifting.  But the chancellor, and I went to see him, he said I can't let you be president 'cause you're not a, an educator you're a social worker.  I said but I'm the one you need.  But it didn't work that way so they brought in another gentleman.  And the students wanted to change the name to Malcolm X though because of his leadership, and I really feel I wouldn't have been able to do it, he knew just how to get to the chancellor and work with students so the name became Malcolm X College--
Story_ID: 238774
Speaker 1: You talked about how the students wanted to and eventually were successful in having the college [Crane Junior College, Chicago, Illinois] renamed.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Malcolm X [College, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 2: Malcolm X College, yeah.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And shortly after the name of the college I decided to go and get a doctorate and I started at University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois].  But at the time, racism in Chicago [Illinois] at that time was very heavy and so there weren't a lot of blacks going to University of Chicago, and I was the only one in the adult education program.  And my white counterparts said Barbara [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr. Barbara L. King] don't give, he would mark up my paper with red ink and he say I didn't write the Chicago Style.  The one class I took was from the man who was ultimately gone see that I got my Ph.D. in adult education, and I wasn't ready for that.  I was, had married then and I was going through a very turbulent divorce.  So emotionally I couldn't handle that kind of attack.  If I spoke in class, I spoke from having worked in the field.  I had not had all of the theoretical material that he was throwing us, and so I was the one that wanted to show the balance between the two.  And he always insulted me in the class.  And when I get my papers back there would be red marks all over the papers.  I didn't know what the Chicago Style was for writing.  I mean I was, nobody ever told me and they said, oh, it's just the way to, it's supposed to be a, a way to, you wouldn't know how to write it 'cause you're black and you grew up in the, you were in a black school in the, well we were in the southwest we used to never wanted to be South, we never wanted to be Georgia, Texas never wanted to be Georgia, Mississippi, and Alabama that was for sure.  But anyway, I just decided to quit the program, and I quit at a time I really could have marched on 'cause that's one, if it's, I don't like the word regrets, I don't liking having regrets, but that's one thing I wish I had completed, it would have been that program.  I was right at the point where I could have gotten out.  They kept saying, "Don't let him get you, you gotta, you gotta get you out of here because we haven't had a black in this program.  Don't let him get you," but things were very unhappy at home so I didn't get a chance to, to finish that program.

Speaker 1: But I did get a chance to meet [HistoryMaker] Reverend Dr. Johnnie Colemon whom I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And what was that like?
Speaker 1: Well, I went to church one Sunday because my neighbor had invited me to come and hear a minister.  She said come and hear Johnnie Colemon, and so I thought Johnnie was a man.  And so I packed up my baby and my grandmother [Ida Lewis], who was still living then, we went to church that Sunday.  When we went got to the church for the eleven o'clock service and she had a ten o'clock service.  We got there at 10:30 so she was half way through, they only had a one hour service.  And I sat down and all of a sudden I realized she got up to preach.  I'm looking at this tall, magnificent woman, sermon was just beautiful and they had a time of meditation which I had never heard of in the Baptist church where you got still.  And heard some affirmations given which would settle you down and I needed a lot of settling at that time.  So when the service was over I went through the line like everybody else, shake her hand and I said, I told her who I was and I said I've never been to a service like this before, I will return.  She said please do.  So I started going to her 8 o'clock service and from there to my 11 o'clock service.  And finally one time I realized this is where I wanna be.  And my grandmother who was a dying in the world Baptist felt the same way.  The church had really brought something out of her and made her more content.  And I look back now, she had so many emotional problems and I, I wouldn't have understood then.  I mean she was so controlling and so, so kind of, she was her own person but the reason she wasn't a very warm and loving, she was a giver, they gave, but the warmth and the love you needed was not there.  And I look back at that now and I realize when she went there something happened to her like it happened to me.  And so I finally got a chance to meet Johnnie personally and that was a great experience.  And this is what she said to me, she was looking out, she had huge picture windows, and I was telling about they wouldn't let me be a preacher Johnnie, and I always wanted to be a preacher Johnnie, and, and I'm going through my little soap opera drama.  And she looked at me and she said, Barbara [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr. Barbara L. King] what's stopping you?  And when she said that I realized nobody was stopping me but me and that was my turning point.  So I pursued aggressively everything I could learn from her.  She at that time, her church was a member of the Unity School of Christianity in Lee's Summit, Missouri.  She sent me there.  I went to school for two years.  I studied everything they had to offer.  And I never heard the metaphysical Bible study and that opened me up to an idea when I preached at fifteen about the hand.  The metaphysics meaning going, belief going under the surface and hitting the spiritual level of what is a literal translation of anything.  So metaphysics, every person, ever place, everything in the Bible has a spiritual meaning.  And when you go underneath and do that, you can then become aware of what the teachings of Jesus and many of the prophets really is.  So I was enthralled by that.  And was eventually, as a result of being with her, working for her as an administrator for three years, when I remarried and came to Chicago [Illinois], came to Atlanta [Georgia], that's how later on I came here in '70 [1970], I started a church in '71 [1971].
Speaker 2: What was your first husband's name?
Speaker 1: (Laughter)  Moses, Moses King.
Story_ID: 238776
Speaker 1: This was another question that I had related to your early experiences with social work.  What kind of work were you doing with people?
Speaker 2: I started out as what's called a group worker.  And the group worker is the one who works with different age groups in the center.  So, the first center I worked at did not have a day care center, later on I worked at one that did.  I was the person that worked with the teenagers, I worked with the senior citizens program, and the women's program.  That means I met with teenagers after school.  Sometimes I had, I had the younger girls, preteens, two days a week, and I had the teenagers, teenage girls two days a week.  I had the senior citizens one morning a week.  That means I was responsible for whatever activities that we could plan together that would make their lives more productive.  Whether it was a cooking class, whether it was a sewing class, whether it was taking a trip, whether it's learning etiquette, whether it was just opening a conversation about what they were going through in school, bringing in people to speak to them to give them a broader base.  These seminars were always located in so called quote impoverished communities.  I worked in a community where you go in a building, you see a door say exit, it might be a toilet.  I've been in buildings where people didn't have hardwood floors, didn't have any wood on the floor, had dirt floors.  So I've, I've seen what, in, you know, what poverty really is.  But in this city twice, three times I've run into three different women, who are now tops in their fields who were in my classes at one of those community centers.  There was one center I worked at, I would bring my, my group home to, I'd bring 'em home on weekends to spend a weekend in my condominium, they'd never seen anything like it.  And we'd have sleep-ins, and I'd talk and we'd share and I'd cook 'cause they were living in, in, in poverty, living in projects.  Sometimes you couldn't get an elevator up to the fifteenth floor, you had to walk all the way up.  And some of those women, some of those girls are now women.  One of them headed the whole library system in Chicago [Illinois] at one time.  And they've come to me, they've, I was in one of the, I was in the West End Mall [The Mall West End, Atlanta, Georgia] when that lady came, she said, "Aren't you Barbara [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr. Barbara L. King], aren't you, aren't you Miss King?"  And I said, "Yeah."  And she said, "Don't you remember me?"  I said, "No."  She said, "I used to sleep on your floor at your house.  We used to have, you used to have, you know, sleep-ins for us."  She said, "I'm teaching now, I'm here visiting."  She said, "They told me you were in Atlanta [Georgia]."  So I still when, when I go back to [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr.] Johnnie [Colemon]'s church to speak, and they do the publicity about my being there, people still come from everywhere that I have touched their life in some way.
Story_ID: 238777
Speaker 1: How do you think social, being a social worker prepared you for ministry?
Speaker 2: Well, I've always loved people.  I'm, always been a people person.  And social work because I worked primarily with groups and later becoming the executive of an agency where I handled budgets and that sort of thing, but I was always the people person.  That's, that comes I guess from the early exposure being with a grandmother [King's paternal grandmother, Ida Lewis] and going to the church conventions, being active in the church, active in the Girl Scouts [of the USA].  I was a groupie, was always a groupie, I was always into something had to do with groups.  So that was, it was a good preparation because the church when I came in to the ministry, was not an example of entrepreneurship of teaching people how to take care of their bodies, how to work with their minds, to know that if you hadn't gone back to, if you didn't get your high school diploma, you can still get it.  So my basic premise for my church [Hillside International Chapel and Truth Center, Atlanta, Georgia] was we were a church that served the whole person, spirit, mind, and body.  And a lot of the seminars and workshops and things that we do, come from that social work background because I saw the transformation of people lives when they learned to do--when, when, when the girls, at one of the agencies that I worked at, you come back some of everybody be pregnant.  And I even encouraged at that time we were not in the midst of a war, some of the girls to go into the service in order to get, go to college and, and change their lives, and some of 'em did, some did not.  But even now in my ministry I understand the pain, the emotional pain that we have to do.  We have a singles group where we can discuss anything and I bring in speakers to speak to them.  We have a couples club and they, they have retreats.  And they discuss books, they are so many self-help books out now, so you can pick a good, a good author and really work with people in terms of the things in their lives they're concerned about.  We do, we teach people how to budget, we teach them investment and how to buy a home, everything it is to be known because we feel the spirit is in you so whereever you, whatever your need is it comes from that spiritual base that you know how to operate and get it done.
Story_ID: 238778
Speaker 1: So you were describing earlier that you had come from being a social worker to an administrator in an agency to being called to ministry and being mentored (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, I was called when I was six.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I was called very early.  I knew I had a calling.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I couldn't explain it.  But all I knew was, I was supposed to be a preacher.  That I knew.  It was just finally getting to the point where I'd walk through many doors to finally get there after meeting [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr.] Johnnie Colemon.  And when I started my ministry in Atlanta [Georgia], I started as a study group.  I did, I wasn't thinking about a ministry because I had been married to a minister and when I got the name of the church in a vision one morning while I was have a time of meditation, I knew I was with him, and he would not take that name for his church, so I just kept the name.  And when I would talk to people just on my job, I was teaching at AU [Atlanta University; Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia] and something would come up and I would share my ideas.  And I had a book called 'The Game of Life and How to Play It,' [Florence Scovel Shinn] which was a good book to have people know life is a game you gotta know which way you're going, how you're thinking, what you're processing, how your emotions are at a given moment.  And people said, you know, why don't you teach that?  I said okay.  So I started a class on Wednesday nights and that class grew, and grew, and grew.  And finally I called my minister, I said, I don't know what's going on but I got a lot of people in here.  She said you'll know what to do.  And one night I said if anybody wants to organize a New Thought church 'cause this will be some new thinking, and I said I'm not a seminary grad.  I, I went to the Chicago City Missionary School [sic. Baptist Missionary Training School, Chicago, Illinosi] but it was to train me to be a missionary and I said I couldn't handle it and I finally got out.  I've spoken at Harvard Divinity School [Cambridge, Massachusetts].  I've been all over the place.  I'm a worldwide leader.  I'm a, I could study, I study a lot but I'm not a seminary grad.  I'm a social worker with an M.S.W.  I'm a woman with three, four honorary degrees but I'm not from a seminary and they said, that's fine.  And so this church grew out of one woman who believed in the God in her and tried to impart that message to others, and that's what Hillside [International Chapel and Truth Center, Atlanta, Georgia] is today.
Story_ID: 238779
Speaker 1: Did you encounter any resistance (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I did.
Speaker 1: --as you were establishing your church?
Speaker 2: This was, this city [Atlanta, Georgia] ate me up.  Resistance from the local ministers who preached me out in their pulpits.  One who said, if you go to [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr.] Barbara [L.] King's church you're going to hell 'cause God didn't call ministers.  Even going to funerals of members' relatives, when they refused to let me come up in the pulpit, refused to let me walk in the procession.  One church I went to the minister had me to come in with the pallbearers before he let me come in with the ministers.  I've gone where I was asked by the family to appear on the program, and they would say Reverend B. King so it would throw them off.  And they find out it was me and they tell me you can't come in the pulpit but you can stand on the floor.  I was talked about, I was ridiculed.  Especially one of our mayors named us the problem church.  Anybody got a problem go to Hillside [International Chapel and Truth Center, Atlanta, Georgia], well that's a good thing.  If that's what the church is for, therefore then that's what we should be.  They talked about us (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Do you mind sharing which mayor that was?
Speaker 2: No.  I, I would--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --rather not.  But people know who he is.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And the thing is that people could dress casually.  If they came in blue jeans, they came in shorts, there was no dress code in Hillside so we were talked about for that.  You know, you don't go to church in blue jeans.  And, and then the church was open to all people.  There was no sign that said no lesbian, no gays, no blacks, no whites, no this, no that.  The church had an open ministry because we felt that Jesus taught love.  And if you love you don't have time to condemn and, and judge anybody.  People are all on their own path.  And there are many manifestations of God.  We recognize the Buddhists whoever come, we've had the Buddhists dancers in our church.  I've met the Dalai Lama, [HistoryMaker] Minister [Louis] Farrakhan has been to our church, Betty Shabazz was there, Daddy King [Martin Luther King, Sr.].  All through the years, my thing is people need to be exposed in the church so they can make their own decisions.  No minister should have people thinking that he's the way that they get to heaven.  That is not the truth.  The minister's job is to bring the message.  It is the person who received it to take it and make it work for them.  If it doesn't work for you, that's why some people, when the minister goes away, array or something goes on and the minister's caught with a woman or whatever, they just go to pieces, oh, but the minister's human and they need to let people know.  My people know that I'm a human being and I have my human frailties like they do.  But I always tell 'em how I got through.  So they'll know, if I can get through (making sound) you can get through.
Story_ID: 238780
Speaker 1: And what is the secret that you tell them of how you got through?  What was at the core of that (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: Well, with story tellings, what The HistoryMakers are about.  I'm a storyteller.  I tell my own stories.  I tell my stories about my divorce.  I tell my stories about my child.  I tell my stories about my grandchildren.  I tell stories, when I stood up to preach this past Sunday, I told the story of how I was witnessing for God at six, didn't know what I was saying, but I was copy catting, and that many times people don't wanna witness 'cause they think it's out of line.  If you're a copycat, if somebody says trust the Lord with all your heart and all your soul, you say, no, I don't know what that means, you keep saying it, it'll come to you what it means.  So, there's always a story that I can tell.  I don't have to get a joke book, I don't have go and find them books for ministers in, in the bookstore where you have some anecdotes or some stories to tell, I have my own stories.  And I tell about my [paternal] grandmother [Ida Lewis], how she reared me, her strictness, how she threatened me about pregnancy.  I tell those stories, same thing I'm saying with you.  And that's why I like HistoryMakers, you give us a chance to tell our stories.  I don't have a, I don't have a lot that I can tell you that my grandmother said something, but I shared with you today, but I have many stories to tell, stories of pain, stories of joy--
Story_ID: 238781
Speaker 1: There's one story that I tell, when the musical 'Mama I Want To Sing' was going around, there was one number in that song where Doris Troy, who is now on the other side, who played, played her mother, she was actually the daughter that her father freed up to go and be, be a nightclub singer when nobody else wanted to do that, but there was one song when she was leaving home that night, when her daughter was leaving home, and her aunt came and she said, there's a song I want you to remember, 'You Gotta Know When To Leave the Party' [ph.].  And that was a sermon I preached because once when I was in college, I was so anxious to have a boyfriend, 'cause see I was tall, nobody wanted to date a tall girl, and this guy came and said he wanted to take me to the game and he was president of the student association at Texas, at Texas State [University for Negroes; Texas Southern University, Houston, Texas], and I just oh, God he chose me to go, oh, my goodness.  So I sewed up my little skirt, my [paternal] grandmother [Ida Lewis] caught me with the skirt sewed up tight when I was getting ready to go, she made me take the basted thread out and wear it, it was a loose-fitting skirt, I didn't wear anything tight, everything was loose-fitting.  And so I went to the game.  After the game he said we're going to a party.  Now my grandmother always told me, always have some bus fare and a way to get back home.  But I had wanted some popcorn and I was so excited about him, I spent all the money.  He took me to a party in an apartment building where there was open drug use, open sex, I had never seen anything like it.  It scared me out of my wits and I said I wanna go home.  He said, oh, you're here now.  You can't go home until we go home, 'cause I was in the car with him and some other college students.  He said and if you walk out that door, by the time you get to Texas State tomorrow, your name will be mud 'cause I'm gone tell 'em what you did.  I walked out of that door.  I walked through an alley way, I came out of the rear of the, of the apartment complex, in complete, I mean darkness like I've never known before.  And when I got to the street, no street light, 'cause we didn't have street lights in those days, no street lights and I'm standing up there, and I knew how to pray that was my church thing, I said Lord, if you just get me out of this, I wanna go home.  No sooner I had said the words, a light came and it was a cab, 'cause you could get, you could get a jitney up and down one road, or you could get a cab.  And I jumped in the cab and I told the guy where I lived.  He said what are you doing over here?  I didn't even know where I was, she always said watch where you're going, but when you're driving in the dark with no street lights, you don't know where you are.  And told him what happened.  He said you know I have a daughter, I wouldn't want it to happen to, I'm gone take you home.  He took me home.  When I got there my grandmother was up in the window 'cause it was about two o'clock, peeping out, he said I'm not charge you anything, he said go in the house.  I got out the cab and she opened the door, I never told her, she went to her grave, she never knew what happened to me that night.  Most frightening experience I'd ever had 'cause I was caught and that was my sermon to young people.  You gotta know when to leave the party, and I told that story.  And somebody came and said, "[HistoryMaker Reverend] Dr. Barbara [L. King], you just don't know, thank you."  And it, it may be in a different time and a different place but the stories we tell repeat themselves because life is consciousness and we get caught in the same traps that our foreparents [ph.] get caught in.

Speaker 1: --If we would just learn to take the good and realize our ancestry, where we really came from, that's why I'm excited about the Ghanaians, is we, if we just really could, could see the flavor of where we came from, it would make such a difference.  I wish I could take every teenager to Africa and just let 'em see how these young people sell their wares in the, in the streets, and you've, you've experienced it, they don't know that.  My, my grandson went over with his, I didn't go with him that year, I was having a health challenge, he went over there with his pants down on his behind, and give me a Coke, and he couldn't get the impact of the culture like I wanted him to.  If I'd a been with him, I might have been able to do a little more, but he was kind of his own with the group from the church, and he just took it very lightly, oh, they out selling stuff, so what?  They don't know the impact of responsibility, self-awareness, self-love, to know what it means to have to earn a living, and not have all of the things that they have for themselves.  He got a car, ooh, I got a car, and he has a cellphone, that's not what it's about.

Speaker 1: So your church started with--
Speaker 2: Twelve people--
Speaker 1: And it has grown now (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) sitting around my dining room table.  Only over ten thousand.  And this is what happens, you will not see ten thousand people because we keep our people counted but Hillside [International Chapel and Truth Center, Atlanta, Georgia] is a church of members, friends, and supporters.  We have three distinct groups in that church.  There are people who have gone to other churches, who come to Hillside make the later time service, make the eleven o'clock service, who will tides who will give, who, and then there are supporters who just love what we do, who say I would love to leave my church but I grew up in that church, my mama, daddy, was there.  I just can't walk away but I really like Hillside.  And so we, we have that kind of thing.  And our, I, actually our, our files which are now, what do we call them on, on not on the Rolodex, whatever you do now with your files to put everybody in order, it's there.  And when we have different programs, like the New Year's Eve is a big night at our churches, it's coming home night.  People fly in, every service somebody's flown in from somewhere.  And when they get ready to go, [HistoryMaker Reverend] Dr. Barbara [L. King] where is there a church like today?  Ain't no church like Hillside, just go to one of the New Thought churches you'll be just fine.  So you will not see that but the people all over the world.  We built a chapel for some nuns in Cachoeira, Brazil outside of Salvador [Brazil].  They are part of us.  We went to South Africa for [Nelson] Mandela's inauguration, met a woman who asked me to ordain her so she could do her work.  She has a ministry for children, which is a part of us in South Africa.  So we, we've kind of been everywhere.
Story_ID: 238784
Speaker 1: You told a very interesting anecdote earlier about your experience (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: --getting to the inauguration of Nelson Mandela.
Speaker 2: I, when I read that Mandela was out of prison after twenty-seven years I, I said, God I just wanna see a man that could endure that and, and come out in his right mind.  That, I was just, just spiritually taken up with it.  So I got up one morning and the spirit said go to the inauguration and I answered, I don't have no money, I don't have no transportation.  But I've learned through the years and I teach this, and Mama [King's paternal grandmother, Ida Lewis] always said, you know, follow your first mind, nobody knew what that meant, you just knew to follow your first mind.  Now I know it's follow your spiritual thought.  And so I called a member that I knew had a business, was doing a business with another woman in South Africa, she put me in touch with her, she called for me, and the lady said okay, she, I'll host her, she can stay with me.  She don't have to worry about a place to stay.  She said now I think I can get an invitation into the inauguration, okay.  So I called the travel agent she suggested, got a very, like $1400 round trip to go to South Africa.  Actually I had about $350 I could really spend, I was kind of tight at that time and I, I couldn't pull up any more than that but I used my credit card to get the, to get the, the ticket and it was on British Airways.  On a Saturday my church [Hillside International Chapel and Truth Center, Atlanta, Georgia] had a prayer breakfast, the women always had a prayer breakfast every year.  And we had Ben Vereen as our speaker, and he had had a very devastating experience with being knocked down by, by a car in L.A. [Los Angeles, California] and had pulled through many operations and quite a devastating time for him.  So he came to testify and to share with us his story and then he danced on the table because see he was, they thought he'd never walk again.  And I got up and I told the church I said I'm going, I'm going to Mandela's inauguration.  And everybody said that's wonderful [HistoryMaker Reverend] Dr. Barbara [L. King].  So we closed out the, the, the breakfast 'cause I was supposed to be leaving for South Africa that afternoon.  Well, I was living in Park Place over in Buckhead [Atlanta, Georgia] and when I got back to my condo, there was no ticket there.  It was supposed to be, it was supposed to be sent over like overnight, no ticket.  So two of my members who were with me were gone take me on the station, I'm all packed to go.  We went up to my apartment, we, and I believe in prayer, I will pray anywhere, any time, I pray on the street, I'm all, I mean prayer in my mind but we sat down and prayed together.  I said what did you get?  And they said we gotta be still.  They said what'd you get?  I said I gotta be still.  So I went on to bed.  And when the next day, I had invited Iyanla Vanzant, who was at that time was calling me her adopted mother, and to be our speaker.  So when I walked in there, she said, "What are you doing here?"  I said, "Well, I didn't get a chance to, to leave but I know I'm going, I brought my suitcase with me, that's my faith."  I got up that morning and told the story in church at eight o'clock what had happened.  One of my members whom I had seen Sunday after Sunday worked for British Airways, he was a supervisor.  He came to me after the service he said, "Look, I'm gon' find you a ticket, and you gon' get out of here today at four o'clock."  He went back to the airport and that's where my ticket was, it was at the airport.  So I had, after the, and at the second service, one of the members got up and said well, Dr. Barbara's going to South Africa, we oughta give her some money, we oughta do something for her, and she hadn't asked for anything, they took up three thousand dollars cash.  That, you know, that was better than [$]350.  So I went after the service, they took me to the airport and I boarded a British Airways plane, we went to London [England], we were in London overnight.  And then from London the next morning, the flight was late leaving that night, then we leaving, we had a day in London and then we were leaving at night to go into Johannesburg [South Africa].  The flight was late, and, but they did pick up a tailwind and when we got to Johannesburg we were an hour behind the time the inauguration was supposed to start.  When I got off the plane, my host said, "We cannot make it to Pretoria [South Africa]"--
Story_ID: 238785
Speaker 1: I didn't realize that the inauguration [of Nelson Mandela] was, was not in Johannesburg [South Africa], it was in Pretoria [South Africa] which was the seat of the legislature and that was forty-five minutes away.  She said, I said, she said, I said, "I have to go."  She said, I said, "I can't come this far and not go.  I have to go."  And I, I had changed my clothes on the plane so I'm all in my African headdress and my African clothes, you know.  And she said, "Well, [HistoryMaker Reverend] Dr. Barbara [L. King], we can try it," she said, "but the roads will be crowded."  We hit the highway no cars, no people, no animals, no nothing.  We got to Pretoria, now when I got ready to leave the spirits said take your badge, and I don't know why I'm gone take a badge to South Africa but I did, I obeyed.  So she said, "I don't think we're gone get through the, we, we won't get through the checkpoint."  We got to the first checkpoint, I said, "Ah, I have my badge, let's try my badge."  So she took it and we got to the checkpoint, she held it up and they waved us on.  And then we got to the second checkpoint, we held it up.
Speaker 2: And what does your badge say?
Speaker 1: Well, this says Fulton County [Georgia].  They knew that made it official.  It says Fulton County Sheriff's Office, they didn't know what that was, Fulton County Sheriff's Office but when they opened it up and they did this, there was my picture and I'm a captain, so that meant I had some seniority.  So I got to the third checkpoint, they grabbed it out of my hand and when they looked and they all communicated in their native language they all did this, they saluted me and said go.  So (laughter) we went down this little narrow path that was very well, everything was camouflaged.  We came out of that path, we were on the presidential drive, we saw men and women from every Armed Services who, in the world, lined up on that, on that presidential drive.  It was, it was so overwhelming to see everyone in their, in their out, their, their Armed Forces clothes.  When we got to the entrance way, and the good thing was she was in a Mercedes [Benz], so that made me look real good, I stepped out of the Mercedes, she stepped out, and I turned when I stepped out, I was facing camera people were there from all over the world, you know, taking pictures and stuff.  So they thought I was some great queen from Africa.  And they were shooting me down.  People saw me as far away as Canada, it was so funny.  And they told her you cannot go.  And she said, "Why?"  They said, "You have to go park the car."  So she left me, and I was little, getting a little shaky about it, 'cause remember I, I, I'm what twelve thousand miles from home, I don't know nothing from nothing.  I walked up the steps to two big burly men who had a, like a, look like a telephone directory but all of the guests names were there between the two of them like, one had from A to L, one had from M to Z.

Speaker 1: Well, they [security at Nelson Mandela's 1994 inauguration] had a list.  So I'm standing holding my badge, see once I hold my badge up, they'll see the badge, they couldn't care less about the badge.  They could not find my name.  So they're standing up there, they're trying to decide what to do with me.  I can't go back to the car 'cause she's gone, I don't know where she is and I'm praying Lord, okay, God, I'm, you, you know, something's gotta give here.  And a lady came running from the right side of me, she said, "I know who that is, that's [HistoryMaker Reverend] Dr. Barbara [L.] King, she wrote 'Transform Your Life.'"  And I said, I took her aside and she said, she hugged me, she said, "I'm so glad to see you," and they looked at her, she was over the hostess she said, "She's fine.  We'll get her seated."  She turned me over to the hostess and they went to see where they could seat me and there was a whole row, had not been filled by an African delegation, they set me in the row, they said, "Now we may have to move you but for right now this is fine."  I said, oh, I'm sitting right in front of the inaugural stand.  I'm looking at Vice President [Al] Gore, I'm looking at [First Lady] Hillary [Rodham] Clinton, I'm looking at [Fidel] Castro, I'm looking at Prince Philip [Duke of Edinburgh], everybody was passing by me 'cause I'm up, you know, with everybody up in front of us.  It was, it was, it was, I just, and I had my little throw away camera, I'm just clicking, click, click, click, click.  And finally I said, well somebody gotta be here from America.  So I asked the hostess, I called her over, and she said, "Yes my love?"  I said, "Is there anybody here from America," the, the, the (unclear) she said "Yes, come."  She took me a little further back and there was everybody I knew, [HistoryMaker] Maxine Waters, [HistoryMaker] Danny Glover, Coretta Scott King and her daughter, Bernice [King], and they were saying, "Hi, Dr. Barbara," and I said, "Hi, so good to see you," but I looked over at where they were sitting I said un-un, un-un.  So I went back up to my seat, (unclear).  Because I didn't sit with them, when the inauguration was over, they had already gotten them out to go to the luncheon, so since I had no invitation, I looked for them and I found out where the hall was for the luncheon, it was just a few feet away, but I allowed fear to take over and I wouldn't go into the luncheon.  So I had went and sat out on, on a brick wall waiting for my driver to come back, 'cause now I'm getting concerned about her.  I was on that brick wall, a good hour, almost two hours.  And when Maya [ph.] and some other people came from the luncheon, they were boarding the bus.  They had been there earlier and so they were boarding the bus on their way back to the airport because there were festivities, you see, prior to, which I knew nothing about, I didn't have no invitation anyway so what did I know.  And she came and sat with me and, and helped me to calm down and she said well we'll work something out.  I said well if I get on the bus with you guys, I know how to go from the airport to, I knew what hotel I was with in, in Johannesburg [South Africa] so I'll just get a cab into the city, I'll be fine.  She said fine.  So by the time the bus came and they were getting ready to board the bus, my driver came.  And what had happened was, the reason the inauguration started late [Nelson] Mandela was down in the lower level dancing with the people's inauguration and that's where they made her go.  So that's why I got there on time, we got there at ten o'clock, he hadn't even came, he was talking, he was down there having a good time with the people.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And that's an experience I've told around the world.  People love this story.  Because this is the badge that got me into, just being a chaplain with the Fulton County Sheriff's Department [sic. Fulton County Sheriff's Office].  Not knowing when I took the badge what it would mean but that's what got me into the inauguration.
Story_ID: 238787
Speaker 1: And that [King's trip to South Africa], of course, was not your last time in Africa.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: You recently were, were bestowed--
Speaker 2: Yes.  In--
Speaker 1: --a very prestigious honor.
Speaker 2: The director [Glenda Blum Minkin] of the international affairs for Mayor [Bill] Campbell called me and said we have a chief from Africa.  We wanna bring him to your church [Hillside International Chapel and Truth Center, Atlanta, Georgia].  I said fine.  So when he came, his name was Chief Barema Notchy,  II [ph.].  And I told him I would call him and have something to say, so when I finished the sermon, I asked him to speak.  And he came, he said how much he enjoyed the service, he was most impressed, and he shared his remarks and took his seat.  Well we were going, I had a, a delegation of people going to Africa that, oh, I was going to Ghana in August, that was my next trip was to Ghana and 'cause he was from Ghana.  So after I got ready, when I got ready to close the service, he said may I speak?  And I said sure.  He came back and he said when [HistoryMaker Reverend] Dr. [Barbara L.] King comes to Ghana in August, we're going to enstool her.  I didn't know what an enstoolment was.  The church went up.  Oh, you know, and people just shouting here, and I, I'm standing up there looking all crazy and what is an enstoolment, you know, the highest honor that can be bestowed.  Then he says she'll be the first woman chief.  And he took his seat.  So I got up and said I cannot do this by myself.  So seventy-eight people took that journey to Ghana with me.  And we toured all over Ghana, the Kumasi [Ghana] area, W.E.B. Du Bois' tomb.  We just, we went to so many key places.  Then we end up down in Kumasi and Nsuta [Ghana], down where the castles are, the slave castles.  And that's the area I'm, I'm the Ashanti, and that's where I was enstooled.  What a ceremony.  The women who were to dress me had a very challenging time 'cause they had never dressed a female chief.  There's a certain way you have to wrap the robe, your shoulder had to be out, I didn't know, so I had on my bra and a dress, I had to come out of that 'cause my shoulder had to be out, your right shoulder had to be out.  They got me dressed, they put gold around me, and I had gold, you have to wear five rings, I had five gold rings, gold breast plate, gold medallion, gold shoes.  Now before I got there, they found out what size shoe I wore and how tall I was so they would know how long to make my, my kente cloth.  And I went through a, a very private ceremony.  And after that ceremony they presented me to the people.  There was a parade of thousands of people.  They had on T-shirts with my picture and my name on it.  They carried handkerchiefs with my name on it.  They, they took me in a, in a, I wanna think of the name but, but it's like a pallet but it's, it's the kente cloth and the men carry you on their, on their heads.  They paraded me through the streets, carried me on their heads, one carrying a huge umbrella over me.  And they took me, we went into a park area, great big open area with people sitting all around, and I sat with the chiefs and the, and I had to go through an enstoolment statement that when we, I read, they read it to me and I had to respond.  And then I was, my, my crown was put on, and so I have my crown, all my jewelry, and everything and I was introduced as Chief Nana Yaa Twunmwaa I.  My name comes from a woman who was called [Yaa] Asantewaa and she led the Ghanaian people against the British Army when they were trying to take the Golden Stool.  The Golden Stool is thought of as, is thought of as the spirit of the people, the soul of the people is that Golden Stool.  Nobody knows where it is except certain people.  And the British wanted it 'cause it was solid gold and so it was, the Golden Stool represents the soul or the spirit and the unity of the Ghanaians.  So to be enstooled is the highest honor you can have.  And then to be a woman, and, when my chief spoke, he spoke about the controversy of me being a female chief.  So everything I've ever been in my life has always been centered around things, it's always being a minister of controversy.  You know, first here whatever, controversy, so.  I, I'm just, I guess I'm, that's the way I'm supposed to come.  I always come to where nowhere else goes.  And my seventy-eight people that day I was enstooled all had on white.  Oh, it was a glorious sight.  And I danced and danced with the, with the women and hugged all of the elderly women, you must always ask permission of the elderly to speak or to do anything, so I asked permission to hug them, they gave me permission, I hugged them all.  I loved the children.  We were there for three days.  And I can't wait to get home this summer.
Story_ID: 238788
Speaker 1: So now Ghana is a home for you?
Speaker 2: It's home for me.  I believe that, even though, well I have recently contacted a group in Washington [D.C.] where you can do the DNA to see what my ancestry is but it has to be Ghanaian.  Now, the only other place I've been where they've claimed me has been to Senegal, that's when they claim you, they say I'm a Senegalese, but I don't believe it.  I really believe I'm a Ghanaian.
Speaker 1: Did they give you any ethnic association when they claimed you as a Senegalese, like did they say you are, Fulani or--
Speaker 2: No, they gave me a name though.
Speaker 1: Wow.  What was that name?
Speaker 2: I don't remember.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I had written that, you know, I've been looking for it, I wrote it down and put it in a very private place and I've been looking for that name but they tended to, to see me because of my spirituality because they would ask me if I could see anything and I would say what do you mean?  And they would say tell us, tell us what you see.  And I would tell 'em what I saw.  And they felt that that that that meant that that was coming out of my Senegalese background.  The dance I've never done it, they never asked me but one of the chiefs told me on Sunday that I was teasing him I said, oh when I come to Ghana I gotta get a husband, he said oh no, you're too spiritual he said just leave it alone, just stay where you are.  He said you know everybody would, you're too spiritual a woman.  So I've been told that and, and a New Thought church is a spiritual experience.  We believe that it's the same thought we've been taught all the time made new when we learn to apply it.  Jesus taught in principles and we do a lot of praising but we don't teach the principles.  And it, if you ask me how can I love myself, you ask me how can I forgive, those are in the principles, so we teach people how to forgive, how to love yourself, how to be healthy, and we have to learn that just praying to the Lord, Lord don't let me have cancer in me.  If you're not, if you don't take care of your body, that's not the idea.  The idea is that you have a conscious mind, you make conscious decisions, you have a will, and if you don't take care of your body you're inviting disease into your body.  And so therefore we teach people about the body.  We teach you about cleaning up your mind because every thought that you have becomes something active in your life if you give it the power of your feeling.  If you think and feel anything strong enough then it becomes an experience and we don't realize that until when experience pops up we're going like where did this come from.  But it's a thought that we had, that we dwelled on, and believed in, and it becomes an experience.  So New Thought goes a little deeper in terms of helping people to really understand who they are, who they are, why they're here, everybody is here by divine appointment but people haven't been taught that.  There's something that you can do that I can't do.  And even as you interview me I don't what it's like being an interviewer but I know this is your skill and you do it well.  So everybody has their place.  The people who set up the lighting, this is their thing and they probably love it.  If you do what you love, not only will the money follow but it gives you a great joy, you go to bed in peace.  And that's why we tell people don't steal your children's dream.  They say they wanna be an artist, don't tell them they can't make money being an artist because it's not always about the money.  The money is there but it's about your soul and you really are nourished by what you believe in, I mean, that's what makes the difference.
Story_ID: 238789
Speaker 1: And it's the New Thought--
Speaker 2: New Thought.
Speaker 1: Is it a movement?
Speaker 2: It is a movement.  And there is, there are two organizations under which we come.  One is called is, Association of Global New Thought [AGNT] and we're under the International [New] Thought Alliance.  They have to do with churches.  Most of us come under the bridges of unity, religious science, divine science, and independent truth churches, like my church in Chicago [Illinois], where we believe that life is consciousness that as a man thinks really so is he.  So when you work for a consciousness, see you've got a conscious level, you've got a subconscious level, you've got a superconscious level, superconscious is your actual spiritual nature.  Remember God breathed into man and man became a living soul, so the breath of life in you is the spirit, you, you're, you're a manifestation of the spirit of God.  And then you got this outer clothing which is used to get around, what you need to do, that's your physical self.  Then you got a mind, and what goes in your mind is what determines your life, and we teach that.  And many churches don't do that but that's what New Thought is about.  How you really think.  It's 'cause how you think about something, that makes the difference in how you, how you, how you perform, or how you go about your daily duties.  So we, many people say, oh, they just positive thinking people but it's more than positive thinking.  It's positive thinking and positive action.  We try not to be negative.  We use a lot of affirmation which is positive statements of truth.  We pray with affirmations.  We do a lot of meditation.  We have to learn to quiet the body down, to know how to be still and allow yourself to hear your own thoughts.  And God may speak to you in a voice, may speak to you in a hunch, and sometimes you just have a peace, you don't know how it's gone work out but, you know, it's gone work out.  So when Jesus talked about having faith, when we think I gotta go get some faith, you don't go get faith, all of this is built in you for you to use to pull it up like you go to that computer, you pull up information, you've got all you need right inside of you.  You just pull it up by your spoken word.  So when I say, when I get on a plane and I say the light of God surrounds me, I'm pulling up my spiritual nature then.  So I won't get on that plane and be afraid it's gonna come down or somebody's gone act a fool.  And I'll say that affirmation, Lord it's me, the light of God surrounds me and the love of God enfolds me, the power of God protects me, the presence of God watches over me, wherever I am God is.  And I'll keep saying that until I'm at peace, and fly on where I gotta fly.
Story_ID: 238790
Speaker 1: What is your opinion of the megachurch?
Speaker 2: I really don't have, you know, I'm, I'm not a condemner, I'm not a condoner.  I think that if people are being reached in some way, there are thousands of people that have never had any spiritual contact even though that they are spiritual beings.  So the church is able.  Any group is able to reach people, then I say fine.  Now what the results are, I will never know because even the scriptures, the Paul says one plants, one waters, but only God gives increase.  There are people who are touched by some of our mega ministers who may not ever come in Hillside [International Chapel and Truth Center, Atlanta, Georgia], may not ever go in some of the Baptist churches, so wherever people can get a word to change their life, then I have no problem with it.  And I wouldn't have one anyway 'cause like I said, I don't turn out anybody's religion.  Whatever their belief system is, that's, that's what they need.  See we, we're really levels, we're at different levels of understanding.  Some people need a Buddha and people go oh, the Buddhists not going to heaven.  Well, I don't think it's gon' be a Buddhist heaven and a Baptist heaven and a Catholic heaven, wherever we gone assemble in spirit, I'm sure the spirit will not distinguish us by our denominations.
Speaker 1: And that's a radical thought for some churches especially (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, that's, that's a new thought.  You got it.  And that's what people don't understand about Hillside.  And because it is a radical thing and you're talking about being open to everybody.  Everybody can't do that.  And to some people (unclear) a sinner and the Catholic is a sinner, and the Jews, look how the people still fight the Jews, they still, there are Baptists who still accuse the Jews of killing Jesus, you know.  All of that, that's craziness.  Whatever happened with that conscious thought of that group of people at times, is not the conscious thought of people now.  So you're, you hate the Jews for killing Jesus, Jews don't want you to say anything about Jesus, that's crazy.  You know, I was so impressed hearing [HistoryMaker] Minister [Louis] Farrakhan and other movement ministers who talk about the principles of Jesus, they teach Jesus but at the same level we do, it's the conscious thought of what was he getting over to us to learn how to live.  If you read the Sermon on the Mount, listen he says take no thought what you gone eat, what you gone drink, for tomorrow will take care of itself.  It's official to the day that you were led up.  If more people know that, they wouldn't get heart attacks from stress, they would slow it down and realize I only have one day.  This is the only day I have.  I'm sitting here with you, I wanna make it the best day I can have so I go to bed at night and I go in peace.  People go to bed with their worries and what's gone happen to me with my income tax, you don't have to do that.  But every day you get up, have your time that you get quiet and say this is the day that I've been given, what can I do for myself to make it a good day, and it makes all the difference.  The things we cry most about, the pity parties we have, we don't have to all that.  And it's good to associate with people who think like you do 'cause when you get into certain crowds and certain environments, you're attuned to that environment.  If you ask somebody how you feel.  Oh, man it's raining outside.  I said well God gave us some boots and raincoats, what's the big deal.  Some people complain, complainers about everything.  And we teach at New Thought, don't complain, look around and see what's good in your life.  You may not have the husband you want but just wait.  Learn to make yourself, I make myself happy, I'm divorced and I live alone.  I go to plays, if I, if I buy a ticket for a play I'm getting ready to go see Colored, 'The Color Purple,' I buy two tickets and I'll invite a friend to go.  That's what you do, you find ways to integrate yourself into a sense of joy and stop waiting for somebody to give you joy and give you happiness and make you happy.  Make your own self happy.
Story_ID: 238791
Speaker 1: Could you talk a little bit about your writing?
Speaker 2: Well, 'Transform Your Life' [Rev. Dr. Barbara King] was my major book.  I, I wrote, 'What is a Miracle?,' [Barbara King-Blake] and some other little smaller booklets but in 'Transform Your Life' I really wanted to say to men and women and even boys and girls who picked up the book, that you don't have to live with fear, that you can be healthy, that you can be alone and be happy.  That your financial needs can be met when you learn that God is your source, not your job, not your mama, not your daddy, they're just channels.  I wanted people to know that faith is an active principle in you.  It's, it's, it's just an active thought.  It's an active movement in you when you can believe that you can achieve.  People ask me how did you build a church like this [Hillside International Chapel and Truth Center, Atlanta, Georgia]?  I said faith was my basic principle, faith and prayer.  So I wanted that book to be a book that would help people to, to realize that they were able to overcome any circumstance in their life.  That they were victors and not victims of their circumstances.  So I set about to, to, to each chapter, to tell some stories and to let them know here are some people one two three, four that you can use.  For example, I preached on Sunday about being a witness, learning to witness to the good things in your life.  And when I ended I gave three, three thoughts.  Number one, be aware of your surroundings, you can't witness to something you don't know where you are.  Always be aware of where you are.  If I'm in the airport, I am so aware of who's sitting around me, who's walking, what's happening.  And when you go to witness about something good in your life, witness with a kindness.  Don't jump on people and this is what you do, and if you do this, but come with a kind spirit, with soft words when you're telling a person this is something that has happened that you think will help them.  And I don't know what my, I don't remember the third one now but it was certainly have been to be thankful for all the things that happened to you.  See you have to learn to thank God for the good.  And I don't think God brings bad into our life.  I think we bring it into our life, I think we create our own evil.  There will not be a devil in my life unless I want him there.  So since I don't want a devil in there, then I'm gonna work at everything I can to believe that God is all there is, there is nothing else.  I don't have to issue with you about the Bible and what it says, if evil is present, it's because I make it so.
Speaker 1: That's a very powerful way of looking at it.
Speaker 2: I know.  And that's why we, we are set apart from many churches.  That's why there are many, they think I'm off the track and I'm not saved and I'm not a Christian and, and I keep telling them Jesus wasn't a Christian either.  The whole Christian ministry started long after Jesus was crucified and ascended.  So, he didn't call himself a Christian, he was a Jew that was for sure.  He never denied that he was a Jew but he never said he was a Christian either.  So why you gone take some religion and make it be (unclear) and if you're not Christian, you're not going to heaven, we don't know that.

Speaker 1: What has been your most triumphant spiritual moment, your epiphany?
Speaker 2: When I speak.  Whenever I speak, and I want you to know, that as far back as that age of fifteen, I never really had to write a speech.  To this day if I write something it's because I may wanna remember, something I wanna refer to, a quote, but to this day I can stand on my feet anywhere at any time and deliver a message, a lecture or whatever.  I must share this with you.  I was asked to be the baccalaureate speaker at Spelman [College, Atlanta, Georgia] when our lady was the president, Johnnetta [B.] Cole.  It was the first baccalaureate on the grounds outdoors, out on Sisters Chapel.  The morning I awaken, I had no voice.  I could barely whisper.  I tried to think who could I send from my church, there was nobody that I knew I could send who do a baccalaureate like that.  When I got to Reynolds Cottage where she lived, I said good morning.  She said what's wrong with you, I said get me some hot tea and lemon.  She said okay.  So she had the maid to bring me some hot tea and lemon.  When I got up to speak, now this is interesting, NBC was on the campus that day because they were doing a story about her, so they were taping the baccalaureate.  When I got up, I stood and I said (starting with a whisper and gradually speaking more clearly), "I am having a challenge with my voice but I ask you, don't hear my voice, hear my heart.  I wanna thank President Cole, the committee, and everybody who is responsible for my being here today, and to the parents who are here who have gone through four years of waiting for your loved one to graduate, I thank God for you and I," my voice just went, just like that.  And somebody I knew started crying.  He was, it was, it was to, there was a miracle.  I and I just, I never stopped talking.  I never stopped talking.  I had my Bible, I referred to the scriptures I wanted to but I spoke to them, I said, I sat in your seat one day and I was sitting there wondering what am I gone do with myself?  How am I gon' make it out here in this world?  See my, my, my talking is always to what I know is true for you.  I've been there.  So I talk from that perspective.  Then I tell you how I got there and I then I invite you to find your path and then give you some principles you can live by.  It was a great experience.  And [Morgan] Freeman the actor, what's his first name from 'Driving Miss Daisy'?
Speaker 1: Morgan.
Speaker 2: He was there.  He had his daughter graduating.  When I, when we processed out, he stopped me he said, the greatest sermon I've ever heard.  Oprah [Winfrey] was on to give the, to give the commencement the next day, they honored us both that night.  The parents came and said I've never heard anybody that even honored us for what we have had to go through to keep our kids in school.  So that's one of the experiences.  I've had so many.  I've, I've, I could, I could, I can tell some stories.  But I've had so many that were always strange to some people yet to people who, see there are a lot of people who can't deal with spirituality, what do you mean by that, is that something funny, and, you know, I don't, what do you mean spirituality.  But when they see it and they hear it and they experience it, that's what Hillside's [Hillside International Chapel and Truth Center, Atlanta, Georgia] all about.
Story_ID: 238793
Speaker 1: I wanted to ask if there was anything perhaps that you'd like to talk about that we haven't discussed as of yet?
Speaker 2: I'd like to tell the young people who may pick up this tape, it doesn't matter whether you were born in the ghetto, I never knew I lived in the ghetto until I got to graduate school, never heard the word ghetto.  That no matter what your personal circumstances are, I came out of a family with two educated parents [Mildred Jackson Shackelford and Lee Lewis] but who could not be together and who released me to a grandmother [Ida Lewis].  It doesn't matter who raised you, no matter how tough they may be, no matter what may be going on, but if you can just hold on to that dream, there's always somebody there that will touch your life, that will help you get through your dream.  Many, many people, when I was teaching in that class and they would give me an offering maybe five dollars.  I played the piano for the church one time for five dollars a Sunday 'cause I had taken music lessons.  God always provides a door, a person that will get you through, if you can just hold on and believe that the God in you wants you to be.  I knew I was supposed to be a woman minister and with all the hell that I went through because there is hell on earth, there's heaven on earth but there's hell on earth, I would not give up.  And there were days it was very painful, there were days when I thought maybe, maybe this, maybe not, but, but even when I would go that way, I'd snap back because I could feel in my very soul that this was my calling.  And every person on the planet has a calling.  They haven't been taught that but I'm telling you everybody has a divine purpose for being here.  And so whatever you do, if that's your innermost desire, because all desire, D-E, means of, sire means the Father, all good desire comes from that Father, that presence, hold to it.  (Unclear) because if you don't, someone needs what your, what your purpose is, and if you don't fulfill your purpose, that person misses out on the part of their life that would have been so fulfilled if you had just let your purpose come through.  I allowed my purpose to come through and when people tell me that I meet, homeless people on the street and they say, thank you, I see you on TV.  Thank you for the message, then I know my purpose is being fulfilled.  And a sense of humility, a sense of humility is no, it's not a, it's not a big thing, it's a humble spirit to know you have touched somebody's life with your artwork, with your singing, with your interviewing, with your camera, whatever, because some people are not good camera people but when a cameraman knows how to catch those moments with the person, that's his purpose.  So I'm praying that some young person will just see me as an example of a woman who came from a broken family, with a grandmother who didn't have anything to give her but clothes, and something--we ate well, but who said God always makes a way, and that spirit in you attracts to you other spirits who always make a way for you.

Speaker 1: How do you feel about the way you've lived your life and what is important to you?
Speaker 2: Well, for a long time I didn't like the way I lived my life because it seemed like it was so much pain.  But as I began to open my heart to more of the teachings of Jesus and understood how to forgive myself, and how to know that, in New Thought teachings we teach that life is a, when you come here, they have lessons and these were lessons I had to learn.  And all those lessons, as painful as they, were brought me to where I am now, and I won't repeat those lessons.  I've got what I'm supposed to get out of 'em.  And now I'm helping other people to live their life a little differently.  So, I'm in a, I'm in a different space than where I was maybe, maybe ten years ago.  I, I've grown to know that everything that happened in my past was okay, it got me to where I am now.  And that's a different, that's a new thought but that's what New Thought churches teach.  And so I'm not unhappy, I'm happier now at this time for something than I've ever been.  I mean I take life in stride.  I like, I have a new home, I like my new home, I live in it, I enjoy it.  I go, I travel.  I don't travel as much as I used to but I still travel, and I love traveling.  I love seeing, I even love nature, I can, you just drive me through the wilderness and I'd, I'm a happy person.  So, yeah, I, I like, I like where I am now, I really do.  And I, I, I have such a love for myself in a very positive way that I take care of myself better.  I hired a cook so I can eat vegetarian every day.  I hired a naturopath so now I walk four, four days a week.  I take acupuncture, I do my colonics.  I've done this through the years but it seems though this, this, this phase of my life it seems most important for me to just really take care of my body temple.  So I like me.
Story_ID: 238543
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Is there anything that you've done already that you would have liked to have done differently?
Speaker 2: I would like to have not married when I did.  I think that I didn't understand at that time about me because I've been so ridiculed and so, so teased about my height, that I was looking for the man who would just love [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr.] Barbara [L. King] but I didn't realize that you cannot give yourself totally because you don't love yourself.  See Jesus said love the Lord they God all your heart, with all your soul, with all your mind, and love your neighborhood as yourself.  We were not taught that, saying you loved yourself in, in our church was sacrilegious, you just don't make a statement like that.  But now we are loving the God presence, you're loving who you are as an expression of that spirit that's in you.  That's a little different.  Not loving yourself 'cause you're the Coca-Cola shape or you got some fine clothes or you got the best looking man in town.  You're loving the spirit of the Lord which we call the Christ consciousness that's in you.  So that's the part I, I, I wish that I, and I begged, I begged for a child and I realize that I, I didn't really know how to rear a child, I guess nobody does, but there's so many things that I didn't know and I learned the hard way.  So I, I would have, I think I would have stayed single for a while longer until I really found myself.  I've looked for myself in someone else and that doesn't work.  So that, that's the part, the marriages I felt, if I had left that alone.  But I was trying to keep up with my, my sisters, you know, you get married, you should about be having that baby by 30, I mean when you gon' have your baby, and now people have 'em at 40, 50, and 60, you know.  But in those days I mean, you know, 30-something everybody had to be pregnant, had to be married.  So I jumped into the fire.
Story_ID: 238544
Speaker 1: What do you still wanna do that you haven't done yet?
Speaker 2: I wished I knew (laughter).  I don't know.  I've thought about that.  I'm going, going home to Ghana this year, October of 2004 and I'm excited about it.  I've always wanted to go to Australia.  I would like to meet with the Aborigines and just talk with them at some point.  So aside from going to Australia, I haven't learned to swim yet.  So, I should learn to swim.  And just what I haven't done is just really relax to the point I wasn't responsible for a lot of people.  I'm responsible for a lot of people.  And I think the day will come when I can just kind of relax in that responsibility.  But they tell me, "Doc [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr. Barbara L. King], come on we need you, don't go nowhere."  I'm not talking about dying, I just wanna take some, a month or two and just, just be on my own.  Just do what I wanna do (laughter).
Story_ID: 238545
Speaker 1: What are your hopes and concerns for the African American community?
Speaker 2: That we can recapture our families to recapture our children.  If we can help those who are making it in the world to realize that making it doesn't mean you give responsibility of teaching your children to be responsible.  That we can stop having, somehow or another we can, Head Start's gone, so many programs are gone that were the good foundation for children when they were out of so called awkward families.  But if we could get some of our young people out of prison, or stop them from going, we prevent them from going to prisons as, you know.  I feel we have more young blacks in prison than we do in college.  That bothers me.  And I don't know what the answer is but I know every time we get a chance to turn some child around, give 'em the truth, give 'em the dreams, let 'em hold their dreams, be there for them, hold their hands, and we can keep them out of the prison system which I think is a slave system for African Americans for this century.  That's my hope.
Story_ID: 238546
Speaker 1: How do you want to be remembered?  What do you want for people to say about you?
Speaker 2: I would like to be remembered as a woman who touched lives, who transformed lives through her message of faith and prayer, and who healed hearts, there are lot of hurting hearts out there.  I know I've had a heart that hurts and I wanna see hearts healed.  So through my message, whether I'm speaking to a crowd or whether it's one on one, and I get a lot of response from people that say, that I've spoken to one on one.  I wanna be remembered as someone who really was there for people in her own unique way.
Story_ID: 238547
Speaker 1: Why do you think that history is important?
Speaker 2: I have, I was a history minor.  I've always loved to dig into the past.  And as I've sat here today I, I just realized before I even came, I said, you know, I'm, I don't know if I should be a HistoryMaker because I don't know a lot of my history.  And then as I've sat with you I've realized that maybe not knowing will help those who like me, who don't know, who just, like I'm just kind of thrown into something else, thrown into a house, a grandmother [King's paternal grandmother, Ida Lewis] reared me, nobody knew anything, nobody said anything, no, no family trees, no this.  So history is important for all of us, and especially for the African American because what you're doing proves that because we don't know, we can't know.  I've been excited about pulling up some of these HistoryMakers and, and listening to them as I would if I were, if I was being featured in a movie because I'm learning more every day and that's what history does for us.  It's a continuing teaching for us to be open and receptive to truth, to the ideas and the ideals of our people.  I'm learning so much more even just being, you lived in Ghana, I have not lived there but the times I've been there, and even just this past week in getting ready, I'm learning so much more about the culture.  And so history brings us to a, a level of understanding we would never have if we didn't know anything about it.  And I think what you're doing is so valuable, so beautiful, but most of all so inspiring and so important for all of us to know who we are, where we came from, and those wonderful stories that we hear that we know our people told.  I read 'em, I didn't hear a lot except for my grandmother, but I love to read the stories.  I must say to you I saw a book called '[Confederate Currency:] The Color of Money.'  I didn't know slaves' pictures were on the money for the very southern states.  I'm enthralled with that book, and I'm gonna preach from it because I don't mind preaching from information that I get.  So history is very vital to a people who are now being open to their true history.
Story_ID: 238548
Speaker 1: And what do you want your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: Well, that people see that a little girl who grew up in a family, who was born to a mother [Mildred Jackson Shackelford], who was in college [Wiley College, Marshall, Texas], who couldn't march because she was pregnant, who came into a city and had me birthed with a midwife, and who had given me to a family before my daddy [Lee Lewis] found out and came and rescued me, I want 'em to know that, every legacy has a beginning.  And no matter what the beginning, that legacy fulfills itself by all the people who touch your life along the way; those people that went into their pockets and gave some money for a teenager who was working her way, even through high school [Booker T. Washington High School, Houston, Texas]; a grandmother [Ida Lewis] who, who sewed, who kept her looking like an angel; and who one day realized that she truly loved her mother when she thought she could never love her because of what she had been told, how forgiveness is such a vital part of one's life; and how you can be honored and have so many beautiful experiences when you open your life to serve someone else, and that's true so you serve God by serving others.  So my legacy must show how a child, a baby, didn't even know they were in the world, grew to be a woman, and who went through a lot of pain, a lot of emotional stuff but who found her way anyway.  So my, my, my, my favorite lady is Sojourner Truth.  And they said she was tall, she was a preacher, and she spoke the truth.  So I wanna be remembered as being one woman still standing.
Speaker 1: And [HistoryMaker Reverend] Dr. [Barbara L.] King, I have to thank you so much for this interview and the time.
Story_ID: 238549
Speaker 1: I'm standing with Congressman Wyche Fowler, who at that time was one of the first white visitors to our new church.  We didn't know who he was, I never met him before but he came to church quite regularly, and then one Sunday I realized who he was and we talked and we became the best of friends.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Great.  Next.
Speaker 1: This is my good friend, [HistoryMaker Reverend] Jesse [L.] Jackson.  Jesse and I had the privilege of singing in the choir together in Chicago [Illinois] when we both went into the movement, into the [Reverend Dr.] Martin Luther King, Jr. movement in Chicago.  And this is at a banquet where Jesse came to be our speaker and we took this picture together.  We often laugh about we sang in a choir of about ten people.  And that's how small our choir was.  Of course, I'm older than Jesse but our, our history goes way back.  I'm now serving on his [Rainbow] PUSH [Coalition] board.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.
Speaker 2: That's my son and I.  I'm mother of one son and four grandchildren.  And this was taken when we entered the new building that was added on to our original building that we purchased.  And he was there to honor his mother that night and to be one of the escorts to bring her into the church.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  What year was this taken?
Speaker 2: Yeah, 1993.
Speaker 1: (Unclear)
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.
Speaker 2: When we went into, when we bought, we were first in a house that we, the house that we called our (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  (Unclear) (simultaneous) please, horizontally.
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Widest part but side to side.  Thank you
Speaker 2: We were first in a house that was our first church.  And then we came around the corner, around the block, and bought a former Presbyterian church.  And this was the Sunday that we moved into our new, second new church home where we are now located.  This is now officially the [Bishop Barbara L.] King Chapel.  There's new addition to the building, it's much larger and can, we can hold 2500 people.  This is a picture taken after we moved into the new church home.  I was standing outside one Sunday and one of the members gave me some flowers, and as usual I used to wear white all the time so I had on my white robe with my kente cloth down the front and she snapped a picture.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.  And about what time period was that taken?
Speaker 2: Nineteen ninety-three [1993].
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.  Thank you.
Speaker 2: This is a picture of President [William Jefferson "Bill"] Clinton and I during his first year in the White House [Washington, D.C.].  President Clinton believed in the power of prayer.  So he had, during the year, at least twice a year, a prayer breakfast for ministers.  And we would gather with him, have breakfast with him, and then he would talk to us and then allow us to talk to him.  He was the most precious person in terms of his, his way with people.  We all loved him.  And even when he got into his own situations, we stood by him and went and prayed with him.  He was the best president we've ever had.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.  Next.
Speaker 2: This is Clara Hale of Hale House [New York, New York].  And Clara was the woman who had a vision, particularly for babies of AIDS [acquired immunodeficiency syndrome] mothers, and so she started Hale House in New York City [New York, New York] and she took in babies of all kinds of backgrounds.  And she not only mothered those children but she had a staff that worked with her.  And she invited me to come and speak to a gathering for Hale House and I was so honored to be there, to be with her.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  About what time period for this?
Speaker 2: About 1995.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.  Next.
Speaker 2: This is my good friend Shirley Caesar, who is one of the greatest gospel singers in the world.  We were both at a banquet sponsored by the SCLC [Southern Christian Leadership Conference] Women's Group and someone caught our attention as we were looking at someone performing or speaking, and took this picture.  I admire and love Shirley Caesar.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Ready.  Next.
Speaker 2: When we started the ministry we were in a house on a hill and so then our name was Hillside and the house was on a hill.  And then we learned that this Presbyterian church was for sale around the corner and we proceeded to raise money and we bought the buildings and this was the second sanctuary that we called home.  And we used to have so many people coming that we had to put chairs down the aisle, put chairs by the windows, and we preached three services every Sunday and they all were packed.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  And now historians that we are, we have to keep asking you the dates.
Speaker 2: Nineteen--
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  (Simultaneous) as best you recall.
Speaker 2: Nineteen, no 1972.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Great.  Thank you.  Next.
Speaker 2: This is an early picture and it would have, it would have been around the '70s [1970s], '72 [1972], '73 [1973].  As usual, in my early days, I always wore white in my pulpit.  And I learned when I went to Brazil from the Sisters of Boamarsha [ph.] that white is my spiritual color.  So that's me standing with the congregation following the service in the '70s [1970s], '72 [1972], '73 [1973].  This is an early picture of a church banquet that we had and this would be around '85 [1985].  I'm giving an award to one of our members for twelve years of membership at Hillside [International Chapel and Truth Center, Atlanta, Georgia].
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Great.  Next.
Speaker 2: This is a very early picture when I, when we had the first church which was the house on the hill.  This was a neighbor, I lived in an integrated neighborhood, and this neighbor found out that I was starting a church and she'd been such a good neighbor.  We, even when she and her family, (unclear) my [paternal] grandmother [Ida Lewis] who reared me, we're eating with her on Sundays, and so she decided to help us decorate the new church.  We had a very bad piece of carpet on the floor, she picked up a rug from her own home and brought it to the house, and she cut off magnolia branches and decorated the house, we didn't have money for flowers, and she admired my grandmother.  So here she is talking to my grandmother.  And she and her husband just both passed away, just a year ago.  But I shall always remember them because they decorated that very first church we ever had.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Next.
Speaker 2: Well, this is the anniversary I think it says 1985, fourteenth anniversary, and here I am with Wally Amos, Famous Amos chocolate chip cookies, another good friend of our church.  And at every banquet--
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Let's pause for a minute.
Speaker 2: This is me during the early days, '70 [1970], around '72 [1972], '73 [1973] in the first, in the second sanctuary that we, that we bought.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Hold on, one second.  Great.  Next.
Speaker 2: That was the opening of the church in the house on the hill.  My minister came from Chicago and there were other ministers who joined us that day to celebrate the grand opening of Hillside Chapel and Truth Center Incorporated in Atlanta, Georgia, a New Thought Ministry with an idea of greatness.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Go ahead.  Next.
Speaker 2: Oh, my goodness.
Speaker 1: (Unclear)
Speaker 2: Well, I finished Booker T. Washington High School [Houston, Texas] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Can you turn that sideways, please.
Speaker 2: Oh, wow.
Speaker 1: You can take that page out.
Speaker 2: I can take it out?
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's loose, it's not.  This was my high school yearbook.  I graduated from Booker T. Washington High School in Houston, Texas in January, 1948.  I'm in my cap and gown and I was valedictorian of my class.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.  Hold on, please.  I'm doing a couple of (unclear) on this one.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Can you flip that little wire.  Thank you for that.  Nice.  Next.
Speaker 1: Ah, this is me in elementary school [Edgar M. Gregory School, Houston, Texas].  I think I was about six or eight years old.  And I was a happy child in elementary school.  I was smart, attentive, the teacher's pet, all those things.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Stand by.  Don't remove it yet.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.  Next.
Speaker 1: This is one of my high school pictures.  I'm sitting on a stoop on the school grounds, always read books, always looking studious, and again straight A student in high school.  Enjoyed, loved school.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Hold on, please.  Got it, next.
Speaker 1: Oh, sorry.
Speaker 2: Um--
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  (Unclear) you're doing good.
Speaker 2: First African American female preacher to be inducted into the religious academy at Morehouse College [Atlanta, Georgia].  And that's the picture of all the ministers who were inducted that day.  And what a great experience to be honored by Morehouse College.  That is an honor I shall always cherish.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  All right.  Is that you in the back row on the right (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: That's me in the--
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  --with the white dress on?
Speaker 2: --that's right.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.  Very good.  Anybody else you care to point out who we should be aware of?
Speaker 2: Can I look at it a minute?  (Unclear)--
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  No, we can, that's no problem.
Speaker 2: Pick up the photograph?
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Oh, I thought she wanted to hold it.  Did you wanna hold it?
Speaker 2: No, I can see it from here.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: [Reverend Dr.] Martin Luther King, Jr.'s sister is right, right here.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  (Unclear) okay.  Now don't put the, hold on, don't put that, 'cause that would confuse us, she's talking about this photo so I don't want 'em to see that other one yet.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Yeah, okay.  So let's just put the photo back and--
Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] Christine King Farris--
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Yeah, she's, she's (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) was inducted the same day I was.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  And she's in the front row--
Speaker 1: With the black robe and the white collar.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  And the white collar, photograph it 'cause she actually did a book signing with us for her children's book--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  --earlier this year.
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  So--
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  --I think some of our, some of our organization's supporters would be interested in that.  (Unclear) do a variation to show both of you guys.  So could you just mention one more time while I'm focused on this particular frame Miss Farris and yourself, just describe the--
Speaker 1: Well, it was--
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  --which row and what color robe she has.
Speaker 1: Christine King Farris is on the first row.  She's wearing a black robe with a white collar.  And I'm almost directly behind her although I'm on the last row.  And she is the sister of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.  And to stand there with her and as a part of the induction, and to even have Coretta Scott King there, who was not inducted that day, but who will, who was inducted later, I believe.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  One second there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.  Good, next.
Speaker 1: (Unclear) we were celebrating, the choir had just sung a song--
Speaker 2: (Unclear)
Speaker 1: --and we all stood up to celebrate the choir 'cause it was such a great song.  That presentation was outstanding.  So standing with me to my left was one of our members, Dr. Henry Braddock, famous psychologist.  I'm in the middle, and to my right is Famous Amos, Wally Amos and his wife.  Wally speaks all over the world and whenever he's in Atlanta [Georgia] he always does a sermon or presentation for us at Hillside.  So he was our guest speaker for our anniversary to which we had about a thousand people in attendance.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.  Good.  Next.
Speaker 1: That is it.
Speaker 2: You don't have, you don't have a picture with the enstoolment.  Ooh--
Speaker 1: Oh, let me get that one.  I'm glad you said that. Ah, ha.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Ah, ha.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: I'm sitting with the chief in Nsuta [Ghana], West Africa and that's the day of my enstoolment.  And all the men that are sitting with me are chiefs from various regions in West Africa.  Whenever anyone is enstooled they all come to a great enstoolment ceremony with their various colorful robes and the women are beautifully adorned and I'm sitting there with all of my Ghanaian gold, my kente cloth wrap, which is my robe, my crown, my sword.  It was a glorious, glorious day.  I will never have another day (unclear).
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Pardon me.
Speaker 2: I will never have another day like that one because that meant that was my ancestry.  That I was really being honored by people who did not know what happened to me when I, when I left the door of no return.  We forget that they, they didn't know what we were going through.  And so to be there and to share and to be called Chief Nana Yaa Twunmwaa I, was an honor I shall always, always cherish.
