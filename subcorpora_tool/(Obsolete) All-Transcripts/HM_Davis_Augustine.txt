Speaker 1: What is your favorite food?
Speaker 2: My favorite food is beans, any kind of dried beans is my favorite food.
Speaker 1: Okay, what is your favorite color?
Speaker 2: My favorite color is blue.
Speaker 1: And do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Not exactly--not really.  I think they all have their beauty, whether it's spring, summer, winter or fall.
Speaker 1: Okay, do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Not really.  I, having served in the [U.S.] Navy, I've been so many places till they're all the same to me.  I personally find no difference in places, people or things.  I've seen it all so I have no favorite.
Speaker 1: Now, do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Not really.  I use the word--when I first came out of the Navy, I used to use the word "for Christ's sakes", "Jesus Christ".  Well, when I was in the VA [Veteran's Affairs] Hospital it irritated a nurse there.  She jumped all over me for using the Christ or Jesus sakes or--she didn't appreciate that.  So I stopped using that word.  Now, I have no favorite saying.  I never use anything--there's nothing that peculiar to me that I use all the time, not no--.
Speaker 1: Not even if there's a big crisis?
Speaker 2: Excuse me?
Speaker 1: Not even in a big crisis?
Speaker 2: Not even in a big crisis.  I might, I might say, "For heaven's sakes"--.
Speaker 1: That's close now--that's close to--.
Speaker 2: Well, I will say that sometimes now, but I never use the words Jesus or for Christ, and I never, I never say anything like that any more.  But I will, I say "oh, for heaven's sakes".  I will say that, if you want to say that's a favorite saying, well, I will say that.  For heaven's sakes, why do you do that or why didn't do this?  Or how did this happen, for heaven's sakes.  I'll do that.

Speaker 1: Let's talk about your background and the background of your family, as much as we can, you remember, and get through.  Can you give us the names of your parents and spell those for us, and the date of their birth too, if you could tell us that?
Speaker 2: Now, that I can't do.  As I stated, I, I can't give you their births.  I really can't tell you.  As I stated before, I left home at a very early age.  And there was very little communication between parent and kids back during that time.  So they never talked about anything where--at least before I left home.  As I said, I wasn't interested in anything like that, but, so, I didn't ask any questions.  And they never passed on any kind of information like that.  The only thing that was passed on to me, I remember my grandmother always said that she had Indian blood.  She had some Indian blood in her.  So I kind questioned that because it just--I wondered how could that happen.  But that's the only thing about family history that was, I remember having been told.  Now, here, just here recently, there was a program, Gil Noble, I don't know whether you're familiar with Gil's program, but he had a--.
Speaker 1: He's a host in New York City.  He has a show called 'Like It Is'.
Speaker 2: Yes, 'Like It Is'.  Yes.  Well, and that's just been here recently, not too long ago, a few months ago.  He had a white fellow on his show, and he was doing a documentary about, documentary about blacks during slavery and also he stated that there were some Indian slaves, which I, I wasn't--I never heard that before.  And the way he described this, I can understand why that could have happened because the contact that the, the Indian people and black slaves had during that time, it could very well happen.  So I, I believe now that there was some validity in what she was saying.  I can very well understand how that happened.  But that's the only thing that I know about my family history.
Speaker 1: Well, could you, what was your grandmother's name?  Could you state her name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: My grandmother's--only one, Mariah Hunter, M-I-R-A-H [sic], Hunter, H-U-N-T-E-R.  Now, that was my grandmother on my mother's side.  I knew very little about my grandmother on my father's side.  As a matter of fact, I, very little I can remember about her.  But I do remember my grandmother on my mother's side because she was more closely associated with and in contact with us as kids back during that time in life.
Speaker 1: Did she live in the same household with you?
Speaker 2: No, she didn't live in the same house.  She lived in the same town.  But I was very, very well--I remember her very well.  I remember I was very close to her like I was my mother [Victoria Davis].  As a matter of fact, I remember when I first left home, she gave me a dollar and fifty cent, it was all she had.  That was my grandmother when I left home at that young age.  So I remember all those things.  I remember when she passed away because she asked for me at her bedside when she was very ill.  And she took my hand and said that, she just--they called me Brother, she just kept saying, "Brother, I'm so tired, I'm so tired."  I remember all of that.  So she, and she passed away that same night.  Other than that, I know nothing about my other family members outside my siblings and my mother and a couple of aunts that lived there in the same town that we did.  But others, I remember very little about them.
Story_ID: 17385
Speaker 1: What was your mother's name?  And can you spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Victoria, V-I-C-T-O-R-I-A, Victoria.  That was my mother's name.  And by the way, my mother's name, maiden name was Davis.  So a question was put to me years, some time here, had been asked how could this be.  And when I went to take some insurance out, and they asked for my mother's maiden, and I said Davis.  So they said, how could--they wanted to know how could that be?  And, and she married a Davis.  So, but, with my experience in traveling around and running into so many Davises around the world, none had no relationship to me at all.  So I can't account for that.  The only thing I can surmise is that, that these different Davises apparently came down from slavery.  Not that the--so I could under--and knowing how slaves were handled, I can understand where you have different Davises all across the United States that's no relation to each other at all.  But now, how that name Davis got attached to them, again, I can say I can only surmise that it came from those white immigrants.  That's how, I don't know, obviously some of those people had, were Davises.  So this name Davis started back during that time.  So that's the only thing I can surmise to account for it being so many Davises.  You find Davises all across the country.
Speaker 1: Can you tell us something about your mother?  I mean did she grow up in La Grange [Texas]?
Speaker 2: No, back during that time, in that part of the country, blacks, they were born.  They grew up; they went to school.  They worked and they died, all within the radius of a hundred miles.  Well, today, you take, you can get in a car, and you can travel through four states in a couple of days' time.  Back there, you didn't have that kind of transportation.  They moved about by buggies, wagons and animals.  So they didn't, they didn't travel the way people did--do today.  So, no, she, she grew up right around in that area.  And the, what little schooling she had, it was down there.  And that's what I know about her.  I, I know that to be true.  And, no, they didn't, they didn't move about like people do today.  See, this--it was a different, all together different world then, from what it is now to us, people.  I--they never dreamed of going from one state to another.  They never even thought about that.  I know when I was a small kid, I, I--train would pass and the whistle would fade away in the distance, I thought of it as, that train, wondered how, how it was in that world where they were going, where that train was going.  So, no, they lived, died, did everything right in the radius of a few miles because of the transportation.
Story_ID: 17386
Speaker 1: What was the town like?  What was La Grange [Texas] like in--?
Speaker 2: La Grange was more or less like the rest of those southern cities were at that time.  I, believe it or not, I've seen a young boy hung, hanging from a tree limb.  I saw that as a kid, a young kid.
Speaker 1: What happened?
Speaker 2: Well, like so many other things happened during that time, accused of doing something that you didn't do or--.
Speaker 1: Do you remember what he did?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: I mean what he was accused of?
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: Was it somebody that you knew?
Speaker 2: It was, it was just too far, it was only about ten miles from my--the town where I--it was between Columbus [Texas] and La Grange, Texas.
Speaker 1: Did you know him?
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: Okay, so this was just--you happened upon it?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, they left him hanging there.  So, what--and I also knew of other blacks around La Grange, Texas who were found dead and there was never no explanation as to how they died.  So, it was like most of those other southern towns.  One thing, a black youngster, boy, man, whatever, you didn't dare look at a white woman.  They were ready to hang you just for, just for looking at somebody.  In La Grange, Texas, I remember, if I'm walking down the sidewalk, and there's whites approaching me on the sidewalk, I not only had to step aside from 'em, I had to get off of the sidewalk and let them pass, things like that.  So it was a typical southern state.  No, it wasn't any different from any of the other southern states during that time.
Speaker 1: Did you all live in town or did you live on a farm outside of town?
Speaker 2: We lived in the little town.
Story_ID: 17387
Speaker 1: My father [George Davis] at one time was a sharecropper.  So we worked the farm, but we lived in the little town of La Grange [Texas], but we went out to work the fields and things like that, outside of the little town's city limit.  So I had a lot of experience on the farm, and I also did other work.  I was the, I was the little man around the house.  My father, at that time, placed a lot of responsibility on me, even though I was just a kid.  So, and so far as the working was concerned, he worked, but when you would expect, the things you would expect a father to do, in the way of taking care of his family, he didn't do.  I'm not saying that he didn't want to do it, but he, his education and what not, he just, a lot of times he didn't have work to do, and especially when he stopped working the farm, then he had to depend on little odd jobs and things around that small town.  And, of course, that wasn't very much.  My, most of my family support came from my mother's side.
Speaker 2: Now, what happened that he stopped working the farm?
Speaker 1: Well, he, he decided to, he claimed he was called to preach.  So he started preaching.  He had a couple little churches.  And that's when he stopped working the farm.  But, naturally, you couldn't take care no family with those two little churches.  And most of the time, the only, the thing the members could give you was food and kill hogs or something.  And that's how they supported their preacher.  But the main part of the caring for my family, financial wise, came from my mother [Victoria Davis], doing domestic work.  So that had a big effect on me, always from a youngster, a little one, I always felt bad about that.  It put a drive into, in me that, that's carried over through the years as I grew up, wanting to try to do something about that, and especially to help my mother.  But that's the way it was there at home before I left home.
Speaker 2: Were you and your mother close?
Speaker 1: Close?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: She's one of the closest persons that, that has ever been on this earth.  She, even though I wasn't there.  I left there when I was around sixteen years of age, and I guess I've lived all over the United States.  But she was always there for me, through letters, and that type of thing, she and my older sister, which just passed away here a few months ago.  And I still miss her, miss her deeply.  But those two people were the two people that were always there for me regardless to where I was or what was happening to me.  My younger siblings, they weren't like my older sister and my mother because, actually, they never come to know me as a brother until after I came out of the service because they were so small when I left, they didn't even remember me when I was there at home.
Speaker 2: Sir, can you name your brothers and sisters and tell us where you are in the--?
Speaker 1: My oldest sister, then I came along, and every two years there was another one.  It was eight of us.  Every two years another one was born.  I had another brother, came after me, another brother that came after him; another brother that came after him, all two years apart.  And then came another brother, then came a sister, my baby sister, then came my baby brother.  So it was the oldest girl, then the next kids were boys, myself and three other brother--four other brothers after me.  Then it was my baby sister, then, the last one was a baby boy.  So it was eight of us.
Story_ID: 17388
Speaker 1: Can you take us back maybe to, and describe some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: In growing up?
Speaker 1: Some of the sights and sounds and smells of households, neighborhoods?
Speaker 2: Well, well it was, it was a small, country town [La Grange, Texas].  It's not that way anymore today, but you had what they called bottom nest (ph.) trees, where trees grow, and it was right on the Colorado River, so you had a free run of--you could go down during--a lot of pecan trees grew around there.  You could go down and pick all the pecans you wanted for nothing, free, nobody'd bother you.  They had no swimming pools or anything like that.  They had what they called creeks, small streams, and, and some parts of these creeks, the water was deep enough to swim in.  So you could go there and go in the water, and that type, that type of thing.  So, but it wasn't very much to do around the town as I recall as a youngster there.  But that's the way it was.  It--I look back on those times, and I think to me it's much better than times are now, with the exception of the racial issue.  You couldn't--there were places blacks could not go.  You couldn't go in a restaurant.  If you go to a restaurant, you had to go around the back, they hand you something out the back.  As I stated, you, going about places, you had to--meeting some white person on the sidewalk, you had to get off the sidewalk for 'em, and all that.  That racial issue was something that's bitter to remember.  But other than that, as a youngster I think it was much better growing up as a youngster than it is with these youngsters growing up in these urban areas and things today.  So, but--.
Speaker 1: Well why--why do you think that's (unclear)--?
Speaker 2: Why do I think that's--well, we didn't have the things to contend with that they have today.  Now, for instance, going to, going to school.  You take kids that smoke, drink, stuff like that, they were in the minority.  The majority of the kids didn't want anything to do with those kids.  But today, it's just the opposite.  You take these good kids and things, they are in the minority.  And they--so it's just, it's just different.  And you have, you have more things to contend with.  Today, they have everything, guns, drugs, everything--kids have to fathom their way through this kind of stuff and, and try to stay on the right track.  And that wasn't true back when I was growing up.  So it's different.  I mean, of course, another thing is, for instance, we worked, was expected to work.  Every summer we had to work to try to buy our clothing for the next school year, picking cotton, picking cotton or doing other jobs.  And we just accepted that.  We knew we had to do that.  And, but I, I look at these youngsters today, they're not too willing to help their parents.  They--as a matter of fact, I know, I've known boys and things won't even cut the grass in the yard for their father, things like that.  Well, that wasn't true when I was growing up.  So, a lot of those things I say, and to me was better, in a way, than they are today, excluding the racial issue.
Story_ID: 17389
Speaker 1: In that part of the so-called, the Indian nation, they called it, as I said tribe, different Indian nation, the Seminoles were the different Indians that was in Texas and Louisiana and that part of the country.  So, apparently, there was that intermingling to the condition that exists at that time between the blacks and the Seminoles because the other Indians--those were the Indians that was in that part of the country at the time.
Speaker 2: Sir, did you grandmother [Mariah Hunter] think that she related to the Seminoles? She said that they're--.
Speaker 1: She never said.  She just said had--but after listening to this documentation there about what happened back there between blacks and Indians at that time, and I do know from history that, not only from what this guy said on Gil [Noble]'s documentation that he was giving, but the largest group of Indians in that part of the country, around Texas and Louisiana were the Seminoles.  So I just assume that intermingling to a certain extent, it was between those two groups.
Story_ID: 17390
Speaker 1: I always liked to go to school.  I was always interested in learning.  I, but we never got to school on time.  It was a month--school had been in session for a month, most of the time before we got into school because we hadn't come, we hadn't come back off the so-called cotton-picking exposition or other things like helping my father [George Davis] gather hay and they put hay in haystacks.  You've heard of haystacks.  That's what they--now, they bale hay, and you see these big rolls of hay.  But back during that time, they stacked, you see those haystacks.  Well, I helped my father put, put hay up like this and whatnot.  A matter of fact, the first time I got my arm broken, I was helping my father haul hay.  I was on, I was too small to be on the ground and take a pitchfork and throw that hay up on the wagon.  And so I stayed on, on a wagon and loaded the wagon, kept the hay, loaded, a level on the wagon.  A gust of wind got under that hay and turned that wagon over.  And I fell and broke my arm.  But, no, but after getting in school, I had a, we had a hard time.  My family, the kids had a hard time in school.
Speaker 2: Now, what was the name of the school?
Speaker 1: La Grange [School, La Grange, Texas], La Grange.
Speaker 2: And it was a, all-black school, right?
Speaker 1: All black, yeah, all black, definitely.
Speaker 2: And who ran it?  Was it run by the church or--?
Speaker 1: No, it was a city school. Even though it was a city school, it was, you know, blacks weren't allowed to go over to the white schools.  And the black schools, in a situation and it was impossible to get the training and what not in, in those black, segregated schools as you got in a white school 'cause all the books and things that we got was books that was discarded from the white schools, books that they stopped using.  And they got new books and things, and then they'd give the books to us 'cause they're used--that type of thing.  But then I had a principal, it wasn't no separated schools like elementary school and--you started--it was no such thing as kindergarten.  You started right to school in, in the first grade.  And you went from the first grade on through.  In La Grange, they only went to the eleventh grade.  You'd go right on through.  It wasn't no middle school and that type of set up there.
Speaker 2: Well, could you graduate after the eleventh grade?
Speaker 1: Well, you could graduate after the eleventh in, in La Grange.  Of course, I didn't graduate from that school.  I went to--I graduated from the high school in Taylor, Texas because they went through the twelfth grade.  But the, as I started to say, we had a hard way to go, see, my parents were AME [African Methodist Episcopal], the church that they belonged to, they were, the AME church.  Now, the principal of the school was a Baptist.  Now, if your parents didn't belong to the Baptist church, you were in a way treated like stepchildren in that school.  He, he would always show favoritism towards the kids whose parents were Baptists.  But if they could use you, like, and, and for something--like I used to, every year go to the county meet speaking because I always won first place.  But that's all they, you know, they, they used you.  Now, I've had another thing--I was back, during that time, I was very easy to learn.  I was what today they call a gifted and talented kid.  They didn't call 'em that at that time.  I was one of these kids.  As a matter of fact, I, I never went through the, the third grade.  I never went through the seventh grade.  I, I skipped those grades because I could do the work of the next grade.  And, but, so I went on through.  I was an athlete.  I did good and so I was always a good athlete.  And I--.
Speaker 2: What sports did you participate in?
Speaker 1: I was so-called all around sports.  I, basketball, football, baseball.  I also ran track.  Well, right from a little fellow on, they always told me that in order to have a chance at this kind of thing, especially, when I went away where I was participating in sports where whites were involved, that you not only had to be good as these other people in order to get a chance, you had to be better.  That was always drilled into you.  Don't say, well, I'm as good as he is.  That won't cut it.  You have to, you have to be better to get a chance.  Well, I found that to be true because later on when I did start going to school where there were other people involved, that weren't black, I found that to be true.  Now, it wasn't, it wasn't because coaches even back there, coaches weren't interested in your color.  They were interested in winning.  But their hands were tied because the general population didn't want it, wouldn't accept it.  So I remember when a school in Arizona that I was on a team, and they, and I had--because I was the only black on the team, that school refused to play us.
Speaker 2: Now, what school are you at, at this time where you're the only black on the team, and you're talking about high school?
Speaker 1: That was--that was in Tucson [Arizona] at the time.
Speaker 2: Tucson?
Speaker 1: I, I--see, I, I, even though I was moving around, I got into school.  I never gave up on school.
Story_ID: 17391
Speaker 1: How did you leave Texas?
Speaker 2: How did I leave Texas?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: When I, when I finished school there, one of the main reasons why I left Texas--.
Speaker 1: And so you finished in La Grange [School, La Grange, Texas], you got to the eleventh grade in La Grange?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, and not only did I go to this other school in, in Taylor [Texas], because of the higher grade, it was an incident that happened at home with my father [George Davis].
Speaker 1: Well, what happened?
Speaker 2: One day my--there was a little place that, where all the kids hung out after school that we weren't allowed to go.  And apparently, my sister had gone to this place.  A fellow by the name of Bubba Franklin ran it, but kids went there.  And my father found out about it.  And he started to punish my sister, and that, and he, you know, he--then, my father, the way he, his idea of punishing the kids was, today would be called child abuse.  But nevertheless, that's what happened back then.  So he kept wailing away at my sister, and, and every time he'd strike her, she'd scream out, you know.  And I was out in the backyard.  And I went in there to stop him.  See, I had, I had gotten, now, even when I was a very young age, I was still, I had reached a point where I felt that I could tangle with him and, and defend myself.  So, the reason why I did that because my mother [Victoria Davis] kept saying, "George, that's enough, that's enough."  And he wasn't paying any attention to my mother.  That's why I went in there.  And when I went in there and, and attempted to stop my father, then he ran out in the backyard and he kept an old double-bladed, double-edged blade ax out there that he would chop wood with.  He ran out there and grabbed this ax, and came back in there and attempted to attack me with that ax.  And my mother got in between us and stopped him.  And he told me if I ever tried that again, he'd kill me.  Well, then I knew it was time for me to leave home right then because I wasn't going to take that from him anymore, and if he, if he attempted to kill me, I was going to defend myself.  And, and one of us--it may have been me, but or it may have been him, but one of us would have, would have died.  So I, then I knew it was time for me to leave home.
Speaker 1: How old were you then?
Speaker 2: I was sixteen years old.  So that's when I left home, and actually, I went on, and I--as I said, I started to--see, I, I didn't get, blacks didn't get what they should have gotten in high school back there, during that time anyway.  So it's, any time I got a, had a chance to go to a school, I would do that.  And I, like, I'd go in for class, and I'd stay at the YMCA [Young Men's Christian Association].  And, and I was able to attend these schools, to attend the schools there.
Speaker 1: Now, sir, let's go back a little bit.  How did you--I mean did you know anybody in another place or did you just pack up whatever you were carry?
Speaker 2: No, yeah, yeah, yeah.  But I'll have to say this, and there have been some whites have always helped me, and in my heart, those people will always have a warm place in my heart 'cause I can tell you, I can tell you this, if it hadn't been for those few whites, I wouldn't be here today.  Even when I was back, back there at home in La Grange, my mother doing domestic work for these people, those women gave us stuff just like they gave their kids, their kids.  At Christmas time, they'd buy toys for us, the women that my mother was doing domestic work for.  The, some of the clothes, they'd take some of the clothes, their kids' clothing and give it to my mother, and things like that.  So, nah, I, I'll forget those people.  And, and all along the way, this has happened.  This has happened, and you have those people that--some of those people have came to help, have come to help.  I, I know, I don't know, talk about God, maybe it was guardian angels or something, I don't know.  Sometimes I kind of question, I believe in God in a way, and then, I don't know, but I can't see how all the things that happened to me--sometime I ask the question, why, when I always tried to do the right thing, and when, why did all these things happen to me?  And I still see that today.  It seem like people that try to do the right thing have the hardest way to go.
Story_ID: 17392
Speaker 1: I didn't tell you about the time when I was going out to look work--look for work during the summer to try to get school clothing and that, and I didn't have any money.  And so I was riding a freight.  And I had been told that I, this place that I was trying to get to, that I could get work there at the compress.  Well, you know, a compress is--if you don't know what it is, it's a place where they press the bales of cotton into smaller bales.  See, a bale of cotton comes from a cotton gin.  It's a big bale.  It's about that wide and what not, but in order to ship that cotton across country and throughout the world there, they send it to a compress and that thing presses that big bale of cotton into a bale about that thick, much smaller so they can, they can load more bales into ships or what, freights or whatever they, however they're transporting that stuff.  But anyway, I had been told to get off of this freight and catch another freight to get to that place.  And I was--had gotten to this place, a place by the name of Katy, Texas, got off and I was, I fell asleep.  I was laying down there sleep, waiting for the next freight.  And suddenly I felt somebody kicking me under my, under the bottom of my foot.  I opened my eyes and looked up.  There's this big white guy standing up there, boots on, a big hat, had already drawn his pistol.  Now, here I was nothing but a youngster.  And he had already drawn his pistol and telling me to, well, they used the word nigger; get up.  I got up, and he says he was gonna lock me up.  I, I started to ask what had I done, what he was, what he was gonna lock me up, what he was gonna arrest me for.  And he, "Shut up, shut up, I'll cave your head in with this gun." Took me on and put me in jail and kept me in jail thirty days, and finally, a white lady came up there--well, every day, they'd bring a different white woman up there, and "Is this the nigger?"  And each one of those white girls said, no.  They didn't use the word nigger, they just said, "That's not the boy."  Then finally this last one, and this white lady came up, and she looked and--see, she was making the rounds to the cells in there.  And she got to the cell where I was, and she asked me, she say, "You're nothing, you're nothing but a baby, you're nothing but a boy; what are you doing in here?"  And I told her, "I don't know, ma'am."  She said, "Does your mother know where you are?"  I said, "No, ma'am."  She said, "Well, you can write can't you?"  I said, "Yes, ma'am."  She said, "I'm gonna get you some paper and a pencil, and you're gonna write your mother because she's worried to death, wondering where you are."  I said, "No, ma'am, I, I'd rather not write because she'd worry more if she knew I was in here."  So she said, "Well, I'm gonna get you out of here.  If I get you out of here, will you promise me you'll go straight home to your mother?"  I said, "Yes, ma'am."  She said, "Well, I'm gonna get you out of here."  And sure enough, the next morning, this old guy came up there, and opened the door, "Come on out of here, nigger"; took me downstairs and I had two dollars in my pocket.  He gave that back to me, and he said, "Now, I want you to get out of town."  I got outside and this white lady was standing out there, outside, and she says, "Now, I, I kept my promise.  I want you to keep yours", I think.  And I said, "Yes, ma'am, I will."  So then I asked him what time was the--see, I could, I could ride a passenger train back to my home during that time for a dollar.  I asked him what time was the next train leaving there.  He said, told me, "It's not, it's not leaving here, but--not leaving here 'til two o'clock, but I want you to get out of town now, nigger."  So I had start walking.  She got in a car with him and followed me all the way out of, out of town.  And she was in the car with him, and then he finally turned around to go back, and she waved at me when I--turn around and go back.  But then I, I got--I, I did, I didn't, I didn't use that dollar.  The next freight coming along, I got a freight that, that, there in Katy, was going back to my home [La Grange, Texas].  I got on that thing and rode that thing back home that night.  I got home, and I asked my siblings--my mother [Victoria Davis] wasn't there.  And they told me, said she's in Taylor [Texas].  And they, they--I said, what is she doing in--they didn't know.  So I got, I got in the--and they didn't know what was going on.  You know, they were small and so I, I caught the next passenger train and rode on to Taylor and got off and went there.  And when I walked up to the door, they were singing in there and praying.  I knocked on the door, and they--things got quiet and they asked, "Who is that?"  And they all called me Brother.  I said, "This is Brother."  They said, "Who?"  I said, "Brother."  And all you could hear was, "Thank you, Jesus, thank you, Jesus, thank you, Jesus."  And they, they come and opened the door, and they grabbed me in and they're crying and going on, and still saying "Thank you, Jesus, thank you, Jesus."  Well, there had been a freight wreck not too far from Texas and it turned over and several of the box cars burned.  And they found an old straw hat that I was wearing when I left home.  And they thought I had gotten burned up in that freight wreck.  And but--that's one of the things.  Of course, back--that was during the Depression, back during the Depression.  But anyway, after I decided to--that it was best for me to get away from home because of that incident with my father [George Davis], then I had tried, after I--I had tried to get into Tuskegee [University], Lincoln [University], Wilberforce [University], Howard [University], these are all black schools, and to work so I'd work my way through college.  And none of, none of those could take me because they said they had all the students that they could handle in that capacity.  So then that's when I decided to join the [U.S.] Army, to try to make money and to go on to college.
Story_ID: 17393
Speaker 1: You know how much they were paying a private in the [U.S.] Army?  Thirty dollars a month.  But believe it or not, see, I got my uniform and things all, shoes and things all free, but they gave you thirty dollars in money a month.  That's what you got.  And I would take half of that thirty dollars and send it to my mother [Victoria Davis] to try to help her.  So that went on all the way through the Army, and consequently, when my time was up in the Army, I still didn't have enough money to go to college.
Speaker 2: So when was it that you joined the Army?
Speaker 1: Joined the Army?  That was in '35 [1935].
Speaker 2: And you were still, you were like sixteen?
Speaker 1: Huh?
Speaker 2: How old were then?
Speaker 1: Sixteen.  I, I wasn't old enough to--I should have been eighteen, but the guys accepted me anyway.  They looked at me and said, "Well, you're gonna make a big guy anyway."  So they accepted me.  And I joined the 25th Infantry.  Now, that was the only black outfit in the United States Army at that time.  There was the 9th and 10th Cavalry and the 24th Infantry was all black.  But they didn't have arms.  The 25th Infantry was the only black unit in the armed forces at that time that had, that had weapons.  But anyway, I went on, I went and did my time there.  I served part of it in, in a rifle company, the F Company was, was the rifle company, and the balance of it, of the time there, I served in a machine gun company, H Company, which was a machine gun company.  But when I, I was discharged from that, and I still didn't have enough money to go on to college, but the [U.S.] Navy was paying a little bit more than they were paying in the Army.  And on enlisting in the Navy, to go in, you were--instead of getting thirty dollars a month, you would get forty-five dollars a month.  So then I joined the Navy.  Now, a black guy could not enlist in the Navy then unless he enlisted as a mess attendant.  You couldn't, you couldn't enlist in the seaman branch of the Navy.  And there weren't any black officers in the Navy at that time, so our special duty was to take care of those white officers.  That was your special duty, but you had a military duty, which had nothing to--and which superseded everything else, didn't have anything to do with being a servant or something or.  That superseded everything else, your military duty.  And right from the start, due to my experience in the Army, I was assigned to a gun as my military duty right from the start.
Story_ID: 17394
Speaker 1: That's when I went into the [U.S.] Army, but what I did, I gave my history and whatnot, so I, I joined the army from San Antonio, Texas.  And that's where I enlisted in the Army, not from Arizona, but from San Antonio, Texas, because that's where I was born, and that's where they had my birth certificate and all this, that stuff that was required to get into the Army.  But like I said, after I got in the, in the service, it--a ship would come in, and when the ship come, and I was in and gonna be in port for any given period of time, I, I'd go up, and, and they let me take classes at, at the University of Washington, when we were in Bremerton, Washington, ship's in dry dock and whatnot there.  Oh, and I went, that same thing, did in, when the ship I was on was based in Honolulu [Hawaii].  While that ship was in port a lot of times, now, I could, I could go off, I could take remedial courses and things at the University of Hawaii.  So I still had that drive in me to continue--finish school.  So that's, that's the way this thing happened.
Story_ID: 17395
Speaker 1: I was supposed to be discharged from the [U.S.] Navy almost a year before that Japanese attack.  But people say that, that Japanese, that that was a surprise attack.  Now, it was a surprise attack in the sense that nobody believed it would happen.  We had gotten a warning a year before the Japanese hit Pearl Harbor [Hawaii] to be on the lookout for a possible Japanese attack.  Now, I don't hear anybody saying that in this other media.  You never hear 'em mention that.  The only thing they said is that a sneak attack by the Japanese. But in a sense it was not sneak attack in the sense that we had been warned a year before that happened to be on the look for a possible Japanese attack.  We had things set up to that effect.  Dawn patrol, they called it, supposed to take off from Ford Island there in Pearl Harbor and fly out on, take reconnaissance flight out every morning at four o'clock, fly out so many miles to see on reconnaissance and come back.  Submarine nets had been placed at the mouth of that channel going into that harbor.  Now, all this is taking place after we got that warning.  Those submarine nets was not supposed to be open after six o'clock in the evening.  One third of the ships in the fleet out there, no more than one third of the ships in the fleet out there were supposed to be in that harbor at one time.  That Saturday night, almost every ship in the Pacific fleet was in that harbor.  We came in there from the [U.S.S.] Breese, the destroyer I was on, came in there, oh, I guess it was around eight o'clock that night.  They opened the submarine nets and let us in that harbor.  They weren't supposed to that.  Those nets weren't supposed to be opened after six o'clock in the evening.  We came in there around, it was around six o'clock, and they opened that submarine net and let us into that harbor.
Speaker 2: Now, what was the name of the ship again, and can you spell it for us?
Speaker 1: Oh--.
Speaker 2: The destroyer you were on?
Speaker 1: Breese, it's on the--did you see that thing the ['Newark] Star-Ledger' put out on me?
Speaker 2: Yes, but I just wanted you to spell it because it's going on tape.
Speaker 1: You see that thing on--B-R-E-E-S-E, Breese.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But, so, anyway all that happened.  And that night, it was some, a destroyer put on patrol outside the harbor there, twenty-four hours a day.  All that was set up when we first got that warning.  That night that destroyer out there had said that they ran into a submarine out there.  And they didn't, they didn't pay any attention to it.  So, that next morning [December 7, 1941], day was just breaking and those guys hit us.  The first explosion we heard, we thought maybe an ammunition dump or something had, they had a fire in an ammunition dump.
Speaker 2: Now, what were you doing at the time?
Speaker 1: Just getting up, getting ready to start the day.  I didn't have on all my clothes.  All I had on was my skivvies, skivvies, you know what skivvies are, shorts and a undershirt.  In the Navy, they call 'em skivvies.  But I also belonged, was assigned to the fire and rescue party.  Now, here's something else.  This is all a black guy was doing; let, let people know I was, I was assigned to the fire and rescue party.  I grabbed that big fire extinguisher I was supposed to carry and started running up the ladder, top side, to join the fire and rescue party, and before I got up the ladder, all the way of the ladder, the top side, they started screaming, crying over the PA system, man your battle station, man your battle station, this is no drill, this is no drill, man your battle station, man your battle--just kept saying that over and over.  And you could tell from the guy's voice, this is no, this is no drill.  This is no drill, this is no drill, man your--so I dropped that fire extinguisher and went running to my gun.  And when, and as soon as I got top side, one of those fighters was making a strafing run to come back.  And he was flying that low, you could see the pilot in the plane.  And still didn't know who it was, but then when I saw that rising sun on the fuselage, you know that big red ball, they called it the rising sun, the Jap[anese] planes carried on the fuselage of their planes, when you saw that, we knew who it was.  We knew it was Japs.  And so, then I went running to my gun.  Well, by the time I got the gun ready to go, well, that one plane came over--well, he was on the other--I was on the port side of the ship, and he passed on the starboard side of the ship.  Well, before I could fire on him, he was out of the distance of my gun because I couldn't fire across the ship anyway because I'd been firing right over on fire--on Ford Island there, which is--we were about fifty yards from Ford Island there.  So, as he was going up, he was turning this way, and I knew, I, I just figured he was, he was coming, he was coming back.  And I was waiting for him.  And it was some low lying clouds that morning.  And when he, when he broke out of the clouds, coming in, well, he had a dead bead on me.  And, and I couldn't start firing on him until he got within range of my gun.  But he was firing already, and you see his shots coming across the water just like it was raindrops.  And right, right across--it was in my--I was right in the path.  And when I started to fire, he got in the range of my gun, and I started to fire, my gun jammed.  And my first and second loader wasn't there to help me.  So I had to try to unjam that gun myself and get that gun back firing.  In the meantime, that guy went right across me.  And it was a smokestack right behind me.  And he cut holes all in that smokestack.  But not a one of those things hit me, but when he got so close there, I just, my gun wasn't firing.  I was still trying to unjam my gun, and I just, I just sort of tensed myself for the impact of the, the bullet hitting me or the bullets coming across there.  But not a one of those things hit me, and how, how that could have happened, I don't know to this day.
Speaker 2: Sir, was your ship hit at that point?
Speaker 1: Yeah, the smokestacks, smoke, smokestack of that destroyer.  He cut holes in that smokestack, dents in that smokestack where those rounds of ammunition hit that smokestack, which was right behind me.
Speaker 2: And could you see other ships that had been hit out there?
Speaker 1: Well, I, I wasn't concerned--well, there wasn't any other ships the other side of me.  Now, there was another destroyer, tied up to a buoy a little farther ahead there, but I, I wasn't looking at these--trying to find these other ships.  I was working on my gun as, to get that gun firing again because those guys were still coming in strafing.  And what they were doing, see, those fighters came in first, and they, they came in to try to knock out all the anti-aircraft--anti-aircraft fire before those dive bombers and torpedo planes start coming in.  So that's what they were doing.  Those fighters came in first.  Everywhere they saw gunfire, they were, they was trying to knock it out before their torpedo planes and the dive bombers came in.  But I, so, no, I, I didn't have time to look for no other ship.  But one thing I did, I did see, after my, I got my gun working again, there was another guy I knew on another destroyer right across from me, near Ford Island over there, he was firing, and I, I saw him get hit.  I mean they, he--the dive bomber was coming in then.  And a bomb, dive bomber got a direct hit and just blew him away.  But that kind of thing--so that, then, that's, that's what was happening.  I, then I was firing too, and here again, I say, my gun, something else people never know and they never show in your movies and things, my gun was the only gun aboard that destroyer I was on that got into action, not another gun aboard that destroyer got in--my gun was the only.  And the captain, my captain was standing on the bridge.  And he was, he was looking at me, and, under all that explosion and whatnot, I couldn't hear what he was saying, what he was saying, but, and those guns, gun sights on those guns, those anti-aircraft guns during that time, they had the old floating type of sights.  Now, they have a little cross in there that floated in the sight.  Now, that's what you--and you put your target on that cross.  With a fast-moving target like that, swinging that gun, that cross wouldn't keep up with you.  And the same way, coming in at you, you couldn't, you couldn't depend on that sight.  Either way, you had to depend on your tracers.  You watch your tracers and see where your tracers was going.
Speaker 2: Now, tracers are bullets that light up?
Speaker 1: That lights up.  And that tells you where you, where you, you know, where your shots are going.  And coming in at you, you're watching your tracers.  Well, you see your, your tracers travel in an arc like this.  They don't go straight this way.  They travel in an arc like this.  Now, the gunner, you can only see that tracer at the highest point of that trajectory.  It may look like you're going right into the target, but by the time that bullet reach the target, it's gone down.  Now, somebody observing from the side, they can tell you what's happening.  The captain was on the bridge there, standing about, oh, I guess about thirty feet from me, and he was, he was telling me where my fire was going.  He--I couldn't hear what he was saying.  I could see his lips in there, but and I was watching, I'd watch his hands, and, and he's telling me when I was on the target.  And see, had I been another guy, white, white, I would have been recommended for a medal.  I got no recognition for that.  So these are the kind of things that I hope and wish that somebody would get out to people in general about something the black guys did in that segregated Navy and not think of us as nothing but servants in that Navy.
Story_ID: 17396
Speaker 1: Now, like I've said before, on your lighter fighting ships, like destroyers, light cruisers, minesweepers, things like that, now these ships carry only around 300 men.  Now, you get on your heavier ships, those bigger ships, heavy cruisers, battleships, aircraft carriers, these people carrying a crew around 5,000 men, well, segregation was very strictly adhered to aboard those ships where they had crews like that.  Those lighter ships, it was different because here, say for instance, on a destroyer, we all slept together in the same compartments.  We didn't, we didn't have a separate place to sleep from the white crewmen.  So we got to know each other, and it was altogether a different situation.  Now, aboard those heavy ships like that, the black guys never slept in the same sleeping quarters as white sailors slept.  And the, the segregation was very much adhered to that.  Like black guys usually, they're, most of the time, their battle station was in the magazine on those big ships.  Now--.
Speaker 2: That's a dangerous place.
Speaker 1: Well, it's where they keep all the explosives.  You're down there five, five or six decks below the waterline, and right in the middle of a powder keg like that, you're carrying everything from a five-hundred pound bomb, torpedoes, mines, you name it, small, smaller caliber weapon, I mean ammunition and stuff like that.  You're right, you're right in a powder keg, and you know if that ship goes down, chances are you're gonna be the one, the ones that's lost.  But anyway, that's the way it was aboard those heavier ships. Later on during the war [World War II], I was transferred to an amphibious ship.  That's a ship that carry guys right into the beach.  I was assigned to an anti-aircraft gun.  All right, later on during the war, finally, when they got this new aircraft carrier built, it was built after what--when they got that U.S.S. Essex, was an aircraft carrier built, and they was sending men from overseas, experienced guys to man that carrier.  Well, I was one of the guys that was sent back to put that Essex aircraft carrier in commission.  All right, this is a big ship.  What did they do?  Right away, they assign me to a magazine, first time that I had ever been assigned to a magazine.  They, they assigned me to a magazine as my military duty.  But only a couple times, after a couple of battles.
Story_ID: 17397
Speaker 1: Halsey--I don't know whether you ever heard of 'Bull' Halsey, the--.
Speaker 2: Admiral--?
Speaker 1: Admiral [William F. 'Bull'] Halsey, they called him 'Bull', that's where, his name got--he got the name 'Bull' because he was a guy that wanted to be right in the middle of the action.  He wasn't like a lot of these high-ranking officers.  They stayed way back out of danger and sent orders out to these other guys out there to do the work.  And the thing I hate about that, they're the people that get all the praise and the--like ol' [General Douglas] MacArthur, they bring him in here and parade him all up and down the streets in New York there, and his chest full of so many medals and ribbons, he have to hold--lean to one side to hold 'em up.  Those are the guys that get all the credit for something that these guys did out there, these little guys out there, in rank, that's out there doing the fighting, nobody never hear about 'em.  They get out, these guys get out there and you take this hill or you take this island.  They don't tell you how to take that island, they just say take this island or man this hill.  And it's up to those guys out there that's, that's facing the enemies, the guys got to fight their way to that, to that hilltop or that island or whatever, these are the guys to take the brunt of the, of the war.  But you never hear of 'em.  The only time you hear of him is when they send him, send him back in a body bag if they can, if they ever find enough of their body to send back.  And then--and they don't say anything about it.  Old MacArthur, did you ever hear of General [J. W.] Wainwright, Wainwright, you probably didn't.  He was right there, MacArthur was right there with Wainwright, when Corregidor, it was obvious, it was obvious and imminent that Corregidor was gonna fall to the Japs.  They sent a message out there to get--for MacArthur and General Wainwright, to get out of there.  So what did--and they sent a submarine in there to, to pick 'em up.  Old MacArthur got on that submarine and run like a yellow rabbit with is tail between his legs.  Wainwright says he wasn't leaving, if my men go down, I go down with 'em.  That's what he did.  They fell, and Wainwright was taken prisoner.  He was taken prisoner.  He wasn't killed, but he was taken a prisoner.  After the war, when the prisoners were freed, Wainwright came to the States here and I don't think anybody ever knew Wainwright was here--had made it back to the States.
Speaker 2: But everybody knew about MacArthur.
Speaker 1: Everybody knew about old MacArthur.  That kind of stuff, it, it makes me sick in the stomach now to think about all that, but, and that man--he's a man, a leader that any man would want to follow into battle.
Story_ID: 17398
Speaker 1: [Admiral William F.] 'Bull' Halsey was the same way in the [U.S.] Navy.  Now, he didn't keep that carrier way back there and fifty miles out to sea or something and send these planes in to attack and this kind of--Halsey had a big aircraft carrier sitting up there, it was, was actually close enough for 'em to fire on that carrier with the artillery from the beach.  That's how close he came in there, and, of course, he didn't get in--he didn't want to get in too close and take a chance on running aground or something or hitting something, so he couldn't get the planes in and off--on and off the, you know, the flight deck.  But Halsey, as I say, I was in that magazine after two battles.  And when Halsey came back, I was in the ward room.  That's where the officers was at.  They don't eat with the listed--enlisted men.  I was in the--it's a mess hall.  They call it, the officers, they call it the ward room.  When they're all in there sitting around critiquing and making plans about what they're gonna do--I'm in there and listening to what these guys say, Halsey spoke to the captain of the [U.S.S.] Essex.  And he says, where all--they didn't use black then, he said, "Where's all these colored boys when GQ", that's general quarters, "Where's all these colored boys when general quarters go--is sounding?"  The captain said, "They're in the magazine."  Halsey says, "Hell, I want to see these boys all over this ship when general quarters is given."  He says, "Hell, we out here to win a war, and these boys have proven to be some of the best anti-aircraft gunners that we got.  And I want to see these boys all over the ship when general quarters go."  And he, he inside--especially, on these anti-aircraft guns, these boys had proven to be some of the best anti-aircraft guns we got.  And we out here to win a war or try to win a war and hope we will win it.  They took me out of that magazine.  They formed an anti-aircraft battery, a four-gun, anti-aircraft gun, manned by all black guys.  I was one of the gunners and so--and also, I was put in charge of that whole battery.  And also, one of the gunners.  Now that you haven't heard or seen from in none of your movies or anything.  Well, now, this came from--Halsey was the commander of the Pacific fleet.  Now, this is coming from the commander of the Pacific fleet.  Now, if black men were prohibited from firing guns, why would this man say this?  Or why, why would he give this kind of order?  Like this thing I showed you, back before, in the first, why was I sent to gunner school if black men were prohibited from firing weapons in the Navy?
Speaker 2: Just a, just kind of for those who see this in the future, but at the time of this interview, most people if they think about Pearl Harbor and black participation, they think about Dory Miller.
Speaker 1: That's all they think of, is Dory Miller.
Speaker 2: He was, he was working in the mess, I think when--.
Speaker 1: Well, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: --when the attack, and the story is that he came up on deck and all the other--yeah.
Speaker 1: And drug this guy--he was a white officer, drug him out of--he had gotten hit out there, and he drug him in.  But, yeah, that's--like I say in my writing, that's all right.  If this occurred, I, I don't say that it didn't happen, because the Navy was segregated.  I know how it was aboard those larger ships.  Now, but don't make a blanket statement and say, just say, black men were prohibited from firing.  Qualify it when you say that.  Explain what you mean, what happened in his case.  Don't leave people with the idea that all black guys were prohibited from firing weapons in the Navy.  But that's the way they--that's the way they present it, that's what you and others, everybody believes.  And I say that all along in the writing, that I've gone to these papers and things to try to--I said, all right.  I don't say that this didn't happen.  Or I don't say that what he did, under those circumstances, your statement could be true.  I'm not saying that your statement isn't true, but qualify it.  And let people know that this was a specific ship, and a specific incident that happened, that it wasn't a general order throughout the Navy prohibiting blacks from firing guns.  It's, it's not true.  When you say things like that, qualify it.  That's my only objection to the way the media presents this thing to people.
Story_ID: 17399
Speaker 1: Let's go back to [the attack on] Pearl Harbor [Hawaii, December 7, 1941] and let's talk about what the scene looked like there. And maybe why the [U.S.S.] Breese didn't get sunk. And there's a story about the [U.S.S.] Arizona too.
Speaker 2: You ready for me to talk? Tell you about it?
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: Then Pearl Harbor, now, see, they have what they call battleship row, and they--now, we weren't tied up to any of those docks.  Destroyers was moored to buoys, we were tied up to buoys.  Now, we were right around, as you came out of the channel, we weren't too far, after getting out to the channel into the main harbor, tied up to a buoy.  Now, when there was all that attack, that was going on there--see, most of those ships were sunk within a minute of--a half an hour because when they knew anything, those guys was dropping bombs and things down on--practically down the smokestacks and things before any of the other guys were even out of the bunks.  Ships was sinking and burning.  And the guys were abandoning ship, jumping in the water.  And those fighters were still coming in strafing and killing the guys in the water.  So, and this, another thing, they always say, now, telling it, giving a description of something that happened in a case like that or during war or anything else in the--individuals tell the story from where they--their viewpoint, where they were and what was happening.  Now, they, they talk about they only lost 2,500 men in Pearl Harbor.  That's hard for me to believe because you take each one of those battleships carried almost 400--4,000 men, not to mention the destroyers or anything like that that carried three--around 300 men and stuff.  Now, and most of those guys were lost on those ships.  Now, you take like the [U.S.S.] Arizona.  The Arizona just went down, and the guys didn't have a chance. But when they sound, man your battle station, even though their ship was blowing up and sinking at the time, here again, that was a battleship.  And like I said, most of your black guys on there was assigned to the magazine.  Those guys went to their battle station knowing that that ship was going down.  They went to their battle stations.  Consequently, they're all down there on that, the Arizona in Pearl Harbor right now.  Now, about a couple of months before that happened, before the war brought--see, in the [U.S.] Navy they like all the other service, the Army as well, they, they go after good athletes.  Ships compete for good athletes just like there in the Army bases and things, like companies go after good athletes.  So the guys, the admiral has rank and the captain of the Arizona was an admiral, where the captain of the destroyer I was on was only a commander.  Now, the captain of the Arizona was trying to get me off of the destroyer on the Arizona because I was a good athlete.
Speaker 1: What, to play baseball?
Speaker 2: For, to play baseball--now see, I played everything.  I played but football, and so, yeah, that's what, yeah, that's what it--because ships compete against each other like schools and things, your bases and things, ship bases, they, they have base teams and things like that.  They, they compete against each other just like colleges and things do.  So he was trying to get me off, gonna take me off the destroyer, that destroyer and move me to the Arizona.  Well, the captain of the destroyer I was on, he made an appeal to the admiral of the fleet saying that the captain of the Arizona was pulling rank on him and attempting to take his best men away from him which was lowering the efficiency of his ship.  And the admiral of the fleet stopped that transfer.  Now, had that not happened, I would be down there with the rest of those guys on that Arizona right today.  So here again, I say, well, maybe there is a God.  I mean so many things have happened to me that I can't explain.  But anyway, that's--
Speaker 1: Well, what did--yeah, can you--I just wondered if you could describe what it looked like and what it smelled like, and--?
Speaker 2: Oh, during that attack?
Speaker 1: Yeah, after the battle, yeah.
Speaker 2: Well, you couldn't, you couldn't smell anything but oil and oil all over the water, from the ships and things, and naturally, smoke, you, you--black smoke and stuff.  You're inhaling that, it's stifling to you--and during, during the battle, you, you could hardly see so far because the, it was so much dense black smoke from those ships burning and sinking.  So it was, it was just, it was, it was complete pandemonium.  As I say, you smelled a lot of fuel oil and stuff like, all those planes right there on Ford Island [Pearl Harbor, Hawaii].  Those planes was all blowing up so there's aircraft fuel and fumes in the air, and all from the ships, the, the whole harbor was covered with oil.  And they guys, if you--that was in the water, all you could do was--and it was fire on the water.  So you were taught in the navy anyway, abandon, abandoning ship in case of fire or it might be fire on the water from the--so you swim as far as you could in the water and when you come up, you come up with your hands first and part the water, part that oil and stuff.  So you could catch your breath and then go back down.  See, you could do that when that, when that oil and stuff is burning on the water, you come up, you part the water, you part that blaze, give you a chance to stick your head up there and, and catch a breath and then go back down.  Well, that's--.
Speaker 1: So what do you try to do?  Swim under it--?
Speaker 2: Swim under it, you have to stay under it.  And that's only, you can only go so far like that, and you, you have to come up.  So it's just, you're just lost.  I mean you just come up and get burned up.  And then another thing, when a ship is sinking like that, you have to get as far away from it as you can because it, it'll pull you right down with it.  It's taking on water, you see, and it's sucking that water in; it'll suck you right in with it.  And that vacuum of the ship going down, even if it, you--it's no longer seen on the surface of the water, it's still a vacuum, there's water coming in to fill that void where that ship went down.  So, so that water and current will, will pull you right down with it.  And it may take you so deep so you won't be able to hold your breath long enough to get back to the surface.  But that's, that's what these guys were doing in the water.  And then--another thing, as I say, most of them didn't have a chance because even though they managed to get off the ship and into the water and trying to swim to the shore, these, these--the fighter planes were coming and just spraying the surface of the water with bullets killing 'em in the water.
Story_ID: 17400
Speaker 1: There was a destroyer coming out the harbor [Pearl Harbor, Hawaii], had got out of the way.  I don't know where he came from around there, but he was full speed coming out, trying to get out of the harbor, and, of course, one of the--the harbor was full of mini-submarines.  Those things was all in the harbor there.  And he had, he saw one of these mini-submarines, what they do, they carried one torpedo, and they, when they used that torpedo, then they used that mini-sub as a torpedo.  It was a torpedo itself, in a, in a sense because then they'd ram a ship with that, and it'd do the same damage as a, as a torpedo would do.  Well, one of these mini-subs was coming up headed for us [U.S.S. Breese].  Well, this destroyer saw him headed for us, and what he did, he went full speed ahead and tried to ram him.  And, of course, he was going so, at the rate of speed, he couldn't make that turn to go on around in, into the channel to get out, so he ran aground over there.  So he couldn't get out.  He was stuck on the ground because see, he, he couldn't make the turn so he went right up on the, on the--there was also a battleship, the [U.S.S.] North Dakota--no, [U.S.S.] Nevada.  They had gotten out of the way, managed to get out of the way, and they was trying to make it out of harbor.  Well, they got past us a few, few yards, and they were taking on so much water, they saw it was gonna sink, and instead of sinking right in the middle of the harbor, so it, it would keep any of the rest of the ships in case they were able to get out of there, and keep from doing that, they just--he headed right for the beach, ran right up on the ground.  So there was that battleship sitting right off, on the ground, not so many yards off our, the stern of the destroyer I was on.  So there was a destroyer and that battleship sitting right there on the ground.  They couldn't, they couldn't go any further.  The, the Nevada did it to keep from blocking other ships.  They knew they weren't gonna make it out of that harbor.  They were taking on so much water.  So they wanted to keep the channel clear in case some of the other ships were able to get out of the way.  So that's what that destroyer was doing.  But, so, the, the destroyer that I was on, and one more light cruiser was the only two ships that got out of that harbor that morning, not another ship got out of that harbor.  And why, how we got of there, I don't know because the, those planes were strafing us, they was dive bombing us, and they were--bombs were hitting all around us and things like that.  And they, they managed to not sink us.  We got outside that harbor, got outside the channel, and then we were picking up submarines outside of--sonar was picking up submarines outside of the town.  So we were going around in circles and things like that dropping death charges, trying to sink these mini-subs outside the--then it was so much pandemonium, we, we tried to join up with that light cruiser.  And they wouldn't let us do it because, because they didn't know what to do themselves.  So we just, we just stayed outside, and in the first place, we thought that there was another element of ships coming in to hit the beach there in Honolulu [Hawaii].  We looked for another attack.  So we were, we was looking and ready for that.  But that, they didn't send any more ships and they didn't send anybody else in there to try to hit the beach there in Honolulu.
Speaker 2: Were you all very surprised that there wasn't a wave of landings, you know?
Speaker 1: Surprised that they didn't try to land somewhere.  Yeah, because we thought that, that was to follow.  And probably they misjudged the damage they were gonna do and didn't anticipate that.  Yes, if they had known that, they could have landed troops in Honolulu.  And besides that, they could have come on to the United States because you take under consideration, most of the stuff that the United States used, during World War II was built after the war started.  So if those people had hit the West Coast over there with tanks and, you know, stuff like that, artillery, they could have marched right on across the United--they'd been across the East Coast in less time than a week because you wouldn't have had anything to stop 'em.  But I'm sure when they look back in history from their viewpoint and see how they--the opportunity that they lost by not knowing the advantage they had over the United States at that particular time.  But we got out there, we--another thing.  We looked at this--that morning afterwards, we had decided that there was not another wave or, or troops or anything coming in to hit the beach there.  We was out around there, and we, and not so, not too close to the beach and land there--of course, we still stayed around that area, not too far, and we saw another ship out there.  We thought it was one of our ships.  It was a ship we had never seen before.  But it had, looked something like a destroyer, and it had a broke back smokestack on it.  So we kept sending signals to it, sending signals to it, figured it, maybe it was one of our ships that we could join them.  They would never answer our signals.  So we would start full ahead, we were going on towards them anyway.  And we were running with full speed, destroyer's, the destroyer is vibrating all over from the, that propeller turning, screw turning back there.  And those guys turned and a couple black puffs of smoke came out of the smokestack, and they turned and started going away from us.  And we were still trying to catch 'em.  And little by little, they started to pull away from us, and we was getting all we could get out of that destroyer we had.  It was getting all the knots that it would give you.  And little by little, that ship started sinking over the horizon, sinking over--and it just completely sunk over the horizon.  You couldn't see it anymore.  And then we turned around and come back. From our reconnaissance, our intelligence, we found that all the intelligence that we had involving the Jap navy, the type of ships it had, the locations of the gun on those ships, which is important in naval warfare, and that type of thing, we didn't know what--whose ship that was.  Come to find out that all the intelligence we had about the Japanese navy was obsolete; didn't even recognize that ship.  That was one of their ships.  Now, why they didn't, you know, confront us, I just figured they was on reconnaissance or something, and they weren't out there looking for a fight so that's why they turned and, and ran.  But that's what happened.
Story_ID: 17401
Speaker 1: Well, for quite a while after--we went on and further into the Pacific after we found out that they [Japanese Navy] weren't gonna try to attack Honolulu, that island is, you know, Hawaiian islands there, then we only had--see, the other ships that the United States had was in the Atlantic.  The--not the bulk of the navy ships was in the, but most of the other ships, naval ships of the United States was operating in the Atlantic.  So those people had destroyed, in effect, they had destroyed the Pacific fleet.  It was only that destroyer [U.S.S. Breese] I was on, and that light cruiser was the only two ships left out there in the Pacific fleet.  Now, the aircraft carrier, [U.S.S.] Enterprise, the [U.S.S.] Lexington, the [U.S.S.] Yorktown, now, those carriers, the Enterprise and the Yorktown, they were spared because they weren't out there at the time.  So, and the, and the Lexington.  The Lexington wasn't around on Honolulu there when they hit.  The only time--then, when we got those ships back out there, you take here, operating with us, it was only that destroyer I was on and that light cruiser.  And the only other things operating with us was PT boats.  You heard of PT boats. [President John F.] Kennedy was on one of those PT boats that was--.
Speaker 2: 109 or something like that?
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't know which one, but I'm pretty sure it was one of 'em
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) 109, yeah.
Speaker 1: Because those PT boats was operating with us.  That's all we had.  We couldn't confront, the [Japanese] Navy, in no kind of sea battle.  Now, the only thing we could do is try to attack by night.  Now, we'd pick a, we'd try to stay out of sight and, and attack by night.  And what we had orders to do is--now we would go in, and if we could manage to get in and try to get to one of those aircraft carriers that the Japs had or one of their battle ships and just ram it, go ahead on into and ram it and try to put it out of commission.  PT boats was doing the same thing.  They had, I think PT boats carried two or four torpedoes, but they didn't try to front or get into a naval battle with it.  We operated at night, and they'd go in and attack at night and, or dispense their torpedoes.  And then also try to go in and ram a, a heavier ship, try to do some damage.  But that's the way we were operating then.  I remember at times, at night, we--this one particular time I remember, that night we had got orders to attack this big Japanese task force, was headed down south toward the Pacific, I mean the Philippines.  And we were going out to--it was night, dark, we were going out to attack this thing.  And you could see--and when they picked us up, and you could see 'em firing on us with their sixteen-inch guns, which those things threw a shell out there about--well, you could see this big ball of fire come bouncing across, hit the water, skipping across the water coming towards us.  And they were firing on us, and they didn't have the correct range, and in the dark, and so a lot of times would shell would--just like you'd skim a rock along the water, that's the way it, the shell would come jumping around.  And a lot of times, they hit, hit not too far from it and go, bounce right over you.  So we, we didn't expect to come out of that, but luckily we survived, well, this is what--those were the way things was happening.
Story_ID: 17402
Speaker 1: What I hope comes out of this that, especially blacks, now I talk, those papers that I'd, especially the 'Montclair Times', now they, those people, when I started to tell these people about this, then although they didn't write about it, they said, well, why don't you write a book about this, said, not only blacks would be interested in knowing this, but there's a lot of whites would like to--because they don't this.  This girl, editor of the 'Montclair Times' that wrote that article for--you probably saw that, she, she said the same thing.  Then I said, "Well, I just haven't been in a conducive atmosphere for writing.  You need the proper atmosphere to write."  Then she suggested, she said, "Why don't you just get a tape recorder and just talk and, and send it to me, and I'll write it for you."  Of course, I never got around to doing that 'cause like I said, I, something always come up and put me in a frame of mind that, you know, it wasn't conducive for writing.  But I would hope that some of the--and, and another thing that hurts me, black youngsters.  You start to tell some of these black youngsters, they're not interested in this.  So many of 'em, you start talking about this, and you try to tell 'em something, they're not interested in it.  And another thing that, another thing that just makes me sick of  the stomach is we got a lot of our so-called black leaders. They would sell their mother or their soul for sixpence.  And they're put in certain positions, politically and otherwise, having to be put in positions where they say things that do not help me or others like me.  They talk against affirmative action and all this kind.  You got the same playing fields that everybody else has now.  Some of 'em been put on certain courts, you know what I mean, simply to promote a political agenda, things like that.  That hurts me, that hurts me.  You know what, now, you may think it's hard to say, but I'd rather fight a person like that than to have fought the Japanese.  Now, that might seem strange to you.  That might sound hard, I mean you might say, well, how could you say things like that.  I mean, but they're hurting me more because I know a lot of those Japanese was just like me, out there fighting because they had to do it and their countries sent 'em out there, and a lot of them had been brainwashed with the propaganda and stuff that they received, just like a lot of these people here.  So they were out there in the same boat that I was in.  See, and I know, for instance, right there in Pearl Harbor [Hawaii], one of those pilots that was in the water there, and they tried to pull him up out of the water, and he just tried to cut himself half in two rather than to take a life, taken a life.  You pull 'em up, and all those guys had rings.  This guy had a Stanford [University] ring on.  They going to school here in the United States.  And I, and, and traveling around to places like this, I mean, even before the war [World War II] started, the guys asked me, "What are you fighting for?"  Guys that had been in the United States and know all about what was going on here.  They said, what, what--well, you have to understand that I'm out here just like you.  Now, maybe you believe some of the stuff that your government have fed you or things that's untrue about the United States, and, and this type of thing, maybe you believe in it and maybe you don't, but I know a, a lot, a lot of you guys out here are wearing these uniforms, are in the same boat that I'm in for economic reasons and things.  You're not--like I was, I didn't join the Army or Navy to learn how to fight to kill somebody.  And I certainly didn't have anything to fight for, what I was going through at that time.
Story_ID: 17403
Speaker 1: You're in commander of a battery of gunners now on the Essex.
Speaker 2: On the [U.S.S.] Essex aircraft carrier.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Let's talk about that.  Let's touch upon that before you lose it.  And under Admiral [William F. 'Bull'] Halsey you're in command of a battery of gunners on the Essex.  You are--.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  Well you know--you know--
Speaker 1: Several other battles.  I just wanna make sure you--
Speaker 2: Other battles. Oh that was on the Essex.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  But the other--when I was on these other ships, guns on these other ships, I wasn't in a battery--I was operating a gun with two other men, a first and second loader.  I was a gunner.  I was the man in--responsible for--see your first and second loader they kept the magazines for you.  They load them.  And on those air cooled guns they had asbestos gloves.  And you'd fire so many rounds--so many drums of ammunition, they had to change that barrel. That barrel would get too hot.  Well they had asbestos gloves. They'd take that hot barrel--take that hot barrel off that gun and put another barrel on it.  Now that was their job.  But so far as shooting and that type of thing, that's the gunner's job. I--it wasn't my job to make sure that that gun had full drum of ammunition on it.
Speaker 1: I understand.
Speaker 2: It wasn't my job to take a hot barrel off it and put another barrel on it.  That was their job.  That's what the first and second loaders were.  So far as operation of the gun otherwise, that's the gunner's job.
Story_ID: 17404
Speaker 1: You said you were in the Battle of Midway [June 4 through June 7, 1942] as well?
Speaker 2: Midway yeah.  Yeah.  Oh yeah.  Well in the Battle of Midway--Now here's something else I saw. Now this is something that I was in myself.  And it came over--I saw something that came over the news there.  They were talking about the sinking of the [U.S.S.] Yorktown in that Midway battle.  And they talk about a destroyer or something.  And they--actually they didn't tell the truth.  You know, when we were (unclear) there, we got the--there was this big Japanese outfit headed for Midway. And we were told that we had to stop those people at Midway. And it was a matter of do or die to stop those people in Midway.  Because the feeling was then that if you didn't stop 'em them, that would give them a better jumping off place to strike the mainland of the United States.  That's why they call it Midway, you know, it the halfway.  But anyway--so we had to--at that time we only had two ships that destroyer I was on [U.S.S. Breese] and a light cruiser.  And we had any number of PT boats. We had PBY's, old slow flying seaplanes.  We had some Army base people there on Midway.  And so--of course, submarines were in it.  We had submarines in the area.  Well naturally the submarine couldn't help us on the surface.  But they were there to attack those Jap ships in the water.  So what happened, we--that outfit was spotted.  So we had the [U.S.S.] Essex and the Yorktown and the [U.S.S.] Enterprise.  No the Essex wasn't there.  Because the--the aircraft Essex was built after Midway.  Actually it wasn't even in the fleet during that Midway attack.  But the Yorktown and the Enterprise and the [U.S.S.] Lexington.  And, of course, they had--those were the three heavier carriers that we had there.  So when these people were spotted, our carriers sent our planes off to attack those people.  In the meantime, those people had spotted us.  So while our planes were going to attack their ships, those planes came in to attack us.  So it was a fierce battle going on there.  Because their plane was attacking us.  So--.
Speaker 1: You think somebody may have made a mistake, you know?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: How they--you think that some higher up made a mistake here?  Or--.
Speaker 2: Well no, no.  It just happened that way.  We knew this would happen.  Just like--they had carrier planes out there too, with their task force.  So they were--they had reconnaissance out.  They were tracking us too.  Actually that's what it all added up to.  They found us just like we found them.  Because see they--just like aboard the carrier, we sent planes off of our carriers every day.  We sent planes out on reconnaissance.  They fly out to--a couple of hundred miles out looking around, see if they could pick up anything, any of the ships.  Well those guys do the same thing.  They send planes out from their ship, aircraft carrier looking around to see if they can spot anything.  Well they had picked us up.  So it just happened that when our planes went for them, they came for us.  So after the battle cleared away the--We repelled them.  We turned them back.  I mean they--
Speaker 1: So did you have to shoot at some--.
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: Did you have to shoot at some of these planes that day?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.  Those planes that were tracking us.  Yeah.  Those planes were all over us like--
Speaker 1: I mean you?  I mean did you have to shoot any of them.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.  Oh yeah.  Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: What's it like being in a battle like that with--
Speaker 2: Well the thing of it is--see it's amazing. We put down on a blanket of fire up like that over our ships we put up a--put up a--instead of trying to fire at a specific plane, you put up--just put up a blanket fire like that.  So an attacking plane had to come through that blanket of fire. And it's amazing how sometimes  those planes come--It's a blanket of fire up there like that.  And it's amazing how times a plane will come right through there without getting hit.  And it happened--frequently, it happened.  Now if you happen to catch a plane off by itself naturally you fire on it.  But when you got planes coming in like this, you can't be switching from one target to another.  You just blanket your ships. Blanket yourself with fire just like you're trying to cover yourself with gunfire.  Forcing them to come through there.  And chances are they're not gonna make it through that blanket of fire.  That's the way you do that.  So yeah, yeah I was firing the time that we got hit.  I was firing on this--one of these guy that had gotten hit. This wasn't at Midway, but it was another time.  And smoke was trailing from his plane and he was wobbling so.  So what these guys do, that they were hit like that, if they could make it back they turn around and come right back and try to fly right into one of the ships.  Usually they try to hit a carrier or a battleship.  They try to hit one of the big ships.  So they just know that they weren't gonna make it.  And they just turned and come right back and fly the plane and all right--to try to fly the plane into the ship.  Well one of these guys was coming back.  And all the plans--when you get in battle formation the ships pull in together.  They got your aircraft carriers in the middle and you have your battleship right outside your aircraft carrier.  Then you have your heavy cruiser right outside your battleships, then your light cruisers then your destroyers.  Well they pull right in together.  The destroyers are on the outer perimeter because you're supposed to protect those bigger ships.  You see a torpedo coming, you try to take it--you take it instead of letting it hit one of those bigger ships.  They figure well it's better to lose 300 men than to let the thing hit one of these bigger ships and lose maybe four or five thousand men.  But that's the thinking of naval warfare anyway.  But anyway, he was coming right in and he was wobbling.  And we were firing on that plane with everything we had and he just kept coming right in.  And he managed to get through there and flew right into one of the carrier over there. But anyway, getting back to Midway there.  Some of the stuff they showed on TV there.  And they're talking about--I think they--it was called 'Midway'.  That program that they showed on TV.  They're talking about the Yorktown.  Now during that time when the Yorktown was hit and had taken I don't know how many bomb hits and torpedo hits. And they were listing, laying way over in the water.  When our planes got back there they couldn't land on the Yorktown because the flight deck was over like this.  So then those that could make--And they couldn't go anywhere else because we were too far from the--to far from, you know, land.  Those that could make the other aircraft carrier took on as many of those guys from the Yorktown that they were able to take on.  The rest of them had to go in the water.
Speaker 1: Did the pilots bail out?
Speaker 2: Well I never saw anybody. I don't think any--I--they may have saved some of them.  But I never was close enough to see whether they were able to pick any of those guys up.  And the way some of those planes hit the water, it probably killed them when they hit the water.  But--so they were still trying to put the fire out on the Yorktown.  And when the Yorktown would roll like this in the water, the destroyer I was on--now they didn't say the--they gave the name of something else in the news media.  But that was the Breese.  We got--every time that destroyer would roll like this, we tried to get under to try to buoy it, keep it from rolling on over.  And they were still fighting fire on that thing.  And finally they saw they weren't gonna save it.  They were gonna have to give it up.  It was rolling--listing more and more.  And they had to abandon ship.  And then when it was rolling like that we had to get away from it.  And when we got away from it, it just went on over and went down.  They didn't show it that way in the--so I'm telling you how they show things in the news and stuff that really isn't true, and say things that's not true.  Now the only way you know what the truth is when you're talking to a person like me that was there when that happened, and it was happening to me--to us.
Story_ID: 17405
Speaker 1: The same way they used to talk about old Tokyo Rose.  You've heard of that name.
Speaker 2: Right.  Just for the record though, sir, people are gonna be looking at this that don't know.  So tell us who was Tokyo Rose and what did she do?
Speaker 1: Well it was a woman that--she put out propaganda about whether--to tell people that we were losing--we--the United States was losing the war [World War II] and we had lost so many ships and this kind of thing.  And that was her job.  Of course, some of the stuff she said was true.  But on the other hand, I mean some of the things she was saying was true and some wasn't true.
Story_ID: 17406
Speaker 1: Now for instance here's something else you never heard about.  Off the Marshall Islands one night we had pulled in from sea and was trying--we were in this cove there.  And we were anchored around close to the beach.  Ships were trying to patch up the damage and stuff that we had received during the day.  And a Japanese sub came in there and came right up in the middle of that horseshoe surface and started firing.  And he only fired about, I don't know, maybe five or six rounds.  And he made a crash dive and went back down, and got out of there.  Well it was dark, no lights.  And so what we were doing every time we see a flash from a gun muzzle coming from over here, we were firing.  Firing on where that flash came from.  'Cause that sub was there and we saw the flash from his gun.  So when he disappeared from there, all we saw was flashes coming from those ships of ours that were on the side firing on him to begin with.  And we lost a cruiser out there.  Sunk by our own ship.  That sub was gone.  And by the time we got underway, our destroyer got underway there, we couldn't find him no--we couldn't find him anywhere.  Well I'm just telling you this 'cause this is something that you never see in the news.  People never knew about and things like this.
Story_ID: 17407
Speaker 1: Again I say the thing that hurts me is what they think about us.
Speaker 2: Did things change?  And now you came out of the service in what, '45 [1945]?  Or was it--
Speaker 1: '45.  But you know one thing, during the war the [U.S.S.] Essex, we'd taken a couple of bomb hits and we came back to Honolulu [Hawaii].  Well the shipyard was full in Honolulu.  All the shipyards on the West coast was full.  They sent the Essex all the way to the East coast here.  We went around through the Panama Canal on out to Newport News, Virginia shipyard there to get damages repaired.
Speaker 2: Now this is during the war [World War II].
Speaker 1: During the war.  Here I hadn't been in the States.  I hadn't been in the States in five years.  We got into Newport News. They gave us liberty.  I got off that ship to go downtown and the driver, which was a white guy--I was already sitting on the back seat.  Now this is during the war.  I was already sitting on the back seat.  I went on to the back seat when I went on--when I got on there.  The bus was crowded.  It was during the evening when all the shipyard workers and things were going home and whatnot.  So I'm sitting on the back seat.  It was a white lady got on there.  And she came on and she pushed her way back.  And she was hanging on to the straps up there.  This guy stopped the bus and came back there and told me I had to get up and give the lady a seat.  Now here I am in a naval uniform just coming here from the warship that's been blown--I won't use the word, but a ship that's been damaged in the war.  And the only reason I'm here is because we had to come in here to get repairs to go back.  And all of us on there knowing when we went back, we don't know whether we'll ever make it back home again or not.  As a matter of fact in a war like that you never look forward to the future.  You just look forward to the next minutes.  Because, you never--really you never feel that you're gonna be able to see the future.  I mean you say, well--you see other guys killed and everything, you say, well--you're just wondering will you be next?  But anyway I got off that ship going on the bus and he came. I told him I wasn't getting up for her.  I asked him, "Do you know where I just came from?"  He didn't wanna hear that.  I told him.  I said, "I just came in here from overseas.  And I'm only in here because the ship I was on has been damaged and we had to come in here to this shipyard.  And we'll be going back overseas."  And I said, "I'll just sooner die here than to die over there."  I told him that.  I had a little shark knife under my blouse.  And I told him, "I'll kill everybody I can get my hand on 'til you kill me.  You'll probably kill me.  But I'd rather die here than to die over there."  So everybody was pleading to him to leave me alone.
Speaker 2: I'll bet they were (laughing).
Speaker 1: And even the lady that he was trying to give the seat.  She was on him.  Said, "Leave him alone.  Leave him--." Everybody was telling him to leave me alone.  And finally the guy saw I guess some of the other people would attack him.  Because they didn't want me to get started in a packed bus like that.
Story_ID: 17408
Speaker 1: Aboard the [U.S.S.] Essex they issued shark knives to the whole crew. They didn't wanna issue shark knives to the black guys.  Now they call them shark knives because they're knifes that you use in case you have to go in the water and you manage to get--and they tell you about fighting a shark, how to fight a shark.  And you strike him--don't strike at his body or anything.  'Cause you can't drive a knife through his body.  You have to hit him on the nose.  That's what you have to--I don't know whether you've seen some of those big sharks.  You can take a fire ax and you can't chop through that hide of those big sharks with a fire ax.  His nose is soft.  But they tell you go at his nose.  That's where--and another thing if you happen to be lucky enough to get on a raft and there's fishing equipment on this raft, there's a little food on this raft.  But it may not.  But if you're on this raft for any length of time, you're not gonna have anything to eat.  You're not gonna have any water.  Although you're out there in the middle of the ocean, you don't have no water to drink.  So--but when all that runs out, then you have to try to catch--catch a fish.  But anyway the captain didn't wanna issue shark knives to the black guys.  So I went up to him.  I'm in charge of all these guys.  'Cause my--I was a steward and I was in charge of all the black guys on it.  And I went up to him.  And I told him, I says, "Now these men go in the water.  And they have to go in the water just like every other man on this ship.  And you give them knifes, shark knifes to these guys to try to survive, and not giving anything to these guys to try to survive to them?"  He say, "Well Davis, actually I'm afraid to give these knives to those guys."  He said, "I'm afraid to give the knives to those guys.  Because the problem they might cause with these knives."  So he says, "Well I'll tell you what I'll do.  I'm not gonna issue knives to those guys.  I'm gonna issue the knives to you.  And if those guys cause a problem with those knives, I'm gonna hold you responsible for it."  So I took the knives and issued them to the guys.  And told them what the captain said.  But another thing--another thing that hurt me, I had to give orders and things to those men.  And they--they  hated me for it, the black guys.  And I tried to explain to them, "These are not my orders.  Just my rank.  I just have to--the orders are given to me and I have to pass these orders on to you."  So that's another thing that hurt me.  But those things happen.
Story_ID: 17409
Speaker 1: The only thing hurts me--again I say the things that I went through and for people to look at me and say that I was nothing but a servant in the navy during World War II.  That hurts.  That hurts.  And most though when it's our youngsters.  So if I could ever get that story out.  Like I say--[Battle of] Tarawa.  They always talk about the--they always depict the thing as if the United States was always on top.  And the United States was not always on top.  And they always present it as if the white guys were the only guys did things of bravery, and this type of thing, to save the country.  They don't show anything about what the black guys did along with those people to save this country.  That hurts.  Going into Tarawa was one of the bloodiest battles we fought.  One of the bloodiest battles we fought going into Tarawa.  That was the starting point.
Story_ID: 17410
Speaker 1: A guy that was a Jewish fellow Bobby Marcus (ph.) was in the navy with me.  He knew about me.  He knew about that--he was a graduate of Bates College [Lewiston, Maine].  And he knew  I was a good athlete.  So he wanted me to go to Bates College.  He was an alumni, you know, of Bates.  He graduated there.
Speaker 2: Bates?  Spell it.  B-A-T-E-S?
Speaker 1: B-A-T-E-S Bates.
Speaker 2: Where is that?
Speaker 1: In Maine.  So that's why I went on to Maine.  And, of course, at that particular time then around Lewiston and Auburn [Maine].  There were only two black families that lived in that area.  Most of the Blacks in Maine lived in--And it wasn't very many of them even there, in Portland [Maine] and Bangor [Maine].  Where blacks, a few blacks that lived in Maine at that time.  That's where they were.  But anyway, I got into Bates.  And at that time they only accepted four black students in Bates at that time.  And that was four black guys.  They had no black girls in Bates.  They only accepted four black guys in Bates.
Speaker 2: Now that was probably upsetting having come back from the Navy an officer.  And then to--.
Speaker 1: After I got out, yeah.
Speaker 2: to come into a situation where you have just guys.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  And then well after I was in Bates for about almost--yhey went by--on a semester basis there.  Just about a semester I started having trouble which they claimed was associated with--see where that--on the [U.S.S.] Essex that gun mount, that gun battery that we had it was right below the flight deck on the port side of the ship.  And there was a five-inch gun right above us, up near the conning tower.  Well firing that five-inch gun fired right over us.  And we had cotton in our ears.  You couldn't--you're supposed to pack it in loosely.  You pack it in hard it's just like not having anything in there.  It's just like hitting the eardrum with a hammer.  But that relieved a little of that concussion from that pressure from that five inch gun being fired right over us.  But anyway, I think I started having that trouble with vertigo.  So I had to come out of Bates.
Story_ID: 17411
Speaker 1: I went into Togus, Maine VA [Veterans Affairs] Hospital.  And they messed around with me almost a year.  I was in the VA Hospital almost a year.  And the guys kept messing around with me and messing around with me.  And then they finally come up talking about they thought they were gonna have to probably do a frontal lobotomy.  So here again one white guy was a young physician there at the VA Hospital in Togus.  He came in there and said, "Davis, don't you let these guys mess you up."  He said, "If I were you, I would just get up and get the hell on out of here."  And he said, "You may be bothered with that condition for the rest of your life and just have to get used to dealing with it.  Then again it may just go away.  But don't let these guys mess your brains up talking about a frontal lobotomy."  So that's what I did.  I got up and got on out of Bates--I mean not out of Bates, out of Togus, Maine.
Story_ID: 17412
Speaker 1: Then the doctors there [Veteran's Affairs Hospital, Togus, Maine] told me that I had better not go back to school anymore.  Because it would only aggravate the condition [vertigo].  Well I went on to--I went on back to Texas.  I stayed with my oldest sister for a while.  And then I didn't like the situation in the home there.  So--.
Speaker 2: Was your father [George Davis] still alive then?
Speaker 1: Yeah, my father was still living.
Speaker 2: And your mother [Victoria Davis]?
Speaker 1: My brothers, yes. Yes.
Speaker 2: No, your mother I said.
Speaker 1: My mother? They--all of them were still alive.  So I left my oldest sister's home and went to live with my brother that was next to me.  And then a situation developed there that I thought it best that I get out of there.  Because at the time he was--he was not living a life that I thought he should live.  And we locked horns there one evening and so--actually what happened he--I took his gun and hid his gun and wouldn't give his gun back to him.  And then he attacked me because I wouldn't give him his gun.  So that situation--I left there.  Then I said, we--at that time I had two more brothers that were living in Cleveland, Ohio at that time.  So I figured there wasn't anything for me to do around in Texas there in the way of livelihood. So I said well I'd go on to Cleveland.  At least I could work on the docks and stuff like that.  You know.  Something for livelihood.
Story_ID: 17413
Speaker 1: One day I was--I got a job at the University Hospital there in Cleveland [Ohio]. And there was a--and I was eating lunch one day with one of the black girls there.  And she was carrying on and on.  There was a black guy that was a physical therapist there.  And she was going on and on about this guy.  So then that's what I got the--I decided, to heck with it.  I'm going on back to college and pursue my goal that I set out from a little kid on up.  I'm going on back regardless of what these guys said.  So I didn't go back to Bates [College, Lewiston, Maine] because it was a small school.  They didn't take over a thousand students at the time.  And everybody that came--it was just one big family there.  All the students knew each other.  Even the professors and things.  They were--everybody knew each other.  And having been out that long I would have to go back in a class behind my class that had gone on at Bates.  So that's when I decided to--and besides my goal was medical doctor. Not a doctor of pharmacy, but a medical doctor.  That was my goal.  So I figured going through a big university like Ohio State [University, Columbus, Ohio] my chance--of course, back during that time a black guy had as much chance getting into medical school as you would have flying from here to heaven without wings.  So I thought if I go to a big university like that my chances would have been a little bit better getting into a medical school.  As I said, you had as much chance getting into a medical school as you would reaching--flying to heaven back during that time.  But I enlisted in premed at Ohio State.  And right from the start one of the guys that they sent me to counsel me, talk about Ohio State and what not, this guy, a white guy told me, "You will never make it through here.  You will never make it through Ohio State."  All right, I went on anyway.  So I took an accelerated course in premed.  Instead of finishing premed in four years, I finished premed in three years.  Because having been out of school as long as I had been out, I wanted to get it, you know, get it on.  So I went summer and I went the year around.  Instead of finishing in the four years, I finished in three years.
Story_ID: 17414
Speaker 1: All right.  I graduated premed [from Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio] and I applied to tewnty medical schools.  And every one of them rejected me.  Including Meharry [Medical College, Nashville, Tennessee].  There was only two black medical schools that I knew about at that time. Meharry and Howard [University College of Medicine, Washington, D.C.].  They rejected me.  And you know what they rejected me on?  You know what they said that since I had went to one of the northern schools, one of those schools should take care of me.  Their first responsibility was taking care of the blacks that came out of those southern black schools.  Can you believe that?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's ironic.
Speaker 1: Well that's what--that's what happened.  That's why to this very day I have no love--no respect for Howard--those schools.  But anyway, Ohio State, which I thought I'd have a fighting change to get into, because I graduated premed there, they rejected me.  You know what they said, we already have our quota--our quota of blacks and Jews. Can you believe that?  That's Ohio State.  We already have our quota of blacks and Jews.
Story_ID: 17415
Speaker 1: They [Ohio State University] said, well why don't you--with your background why don't you just--why don't you go into pharmacy.  I never thought of no pharmacy before.  So I was disgusted.  I was completely--I mean I was hurt.  I went back to try to re-enlist in the service.  And they said--they wouldn't take me back in the service.  They said you would have to go back in at your old rating.  And with your education, you wouldn't make it.  You wouldn't make it in here any more.  So I couldn't switch it to another rating.  Meaning that I would have to go back in a messman's branch.  And they said with your education in fact, they said you wouldn't make it in here anymore.  So then I said well I had no alternative.  I'd go on back and go to pharmacy--go to pharmacy school [at Ohio State University College of Pharmacy].
Story_ID: 17416
Speaker 1: By the way, getting in--during premed [at Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio] I--in some of my anatomy--I remember in one of my anatomy classes, one of the professors told me in one of my anatomy classes, I was wasting my time.  He said, "You--why don't you go on off somewhere and learn how to repair shoes or paint houses.  You're wasting your time here."  One of the professors at Ohio State!  I had another professor in pharmacy school there where I was the only black guy in the class.  And he got up before the guys--he got up before the class and said, the only reason why whites didn't like blacks, because blacks had an offending odor to whites.  You believe that?  That happened. That is a lot-as a matter of fact, I was ready to leave Ohio State.  And there were a couple of principals--I mean professors there in the [Ohio State University] College of Pharmacy, white guys, good guys.  That's why I said I don't--I don't hate all these people 'cause a lot of 'em have helped me.  They're responsible for me being here right now.  But anyway, they told me, "Davis, don't you leave here."  They said, "Why don't you go and talk to the dean of men of the University.  Not to the dean of the College of Pharmacy.  You go to the dean of men of the University.  Tell him what's going on before you leave here.  And just do that before you leave."  So I went on over there and talked to the dean.  And he told--the dean of men of the University told me--he said, "Davis, don't you think about leaving here."  He said, "Hell, that's what they want you to do."  He said, "You go on back over there and if you have any more trouble over there, you just let me know about it.  And they will be the one leaving here, not you." So that's what kept me in the College of Pharmacy.
Story_ID: 17417
Speaker 1: When I graduated from pharmacy [Ohio State University College Of Pharmacy, Columbus, Ohio] it was a routine--they usually brought in representatives from all your major pharmaceutical companies, things like that, to come in and interview the senior class.  It was two of us graduating in my class.  One more black guy.  They brought these guys in to interview all these other guys.  And none of them ever interviewed myself or this other--Rudy, this other black guy.  Never interviewed us.  At that time you couldn't--black guys couldn't get in the pharmaceutical industry.  You couldn't even get a job in retail pharmacy.  You apply--I applied for jobs in retail pharmacy and they said they need you there, but they were afraid to hire you because it may drive a lot of their white customers away.  So hospital pharmacy would take a black pharmacist in for the simple reason that none of these other guys--because they made more money in industry and that type of thing than they could make in hospital pharmacy.  So hospitals needed pharmacists.  So they would take us.  So that's how I got into hospital pharmacy.  And in order to augment my salary, bring my salary up to something comparable to what these other white guys were making in the industry and that, not only did I do hospital pharmacy, I worked part-time retail pharmacy in areas--all black areas.  They wouldn't hire you in retail pharmacy.  These chains and things in none of the retail pharmacy that you know.  Private drugstores.  They wouldn't hire you in a white area.  But those people--drugstores in all black areas, they would hire you.  Now that's what was going on then, all right.  Now another thing that I get into, you get into that.  Even there in hospital pharmacy you could never become the head of the department a chief pharmacist even in hospital pharmacy, that paid more than just a regular staff pharmacist.  That was going on even in hospital pharmacy.  I went--I went into hospital pharmacy in Columbus, Ohio and I stayed in pharmacy in Columbus, Ohio 'til I met my wife [Gwendolyn Newberry] and got involved with my wife and she lived in Cleveland [Ohio].  So that's when I moved to Cleveland and went into hospital pharmacy in Cleveland.  And the first thing I was told when I reported to work at University Hospital in Cleveland--the head of the department called me inside and said, "Now just because we will be working with you, that doesn't mean that we want to socialize with you."  See that's the thing that burns me.  A lot of these blacks today they're out here walking around with their nose in the air and not--and they don't know what we went through.  And to a great extent still going through, up until I retired. I was working in--I transferred to a hospital [St. Joseph's Hospital] in New Jersey, because it paid a little bit more money than the hospital was paying--the University Hospital was paying in Cleveland.  I got there--it was a situation where most of the people they had working in pharmacy there didn't know anything about hospital pharmacy.  So that's why they latched on to me in the first place, all right.  The head of the department, that one that should have been running the department--and when they had department head meetings and all this kind--that should have been attending those meetings, I was sent to those department head meetings.  And I was told at one of the meeting--it kept happening.  I was told at one of the meetings something.  The president was talking about some kind of program.  Whatever they were talking about and they wanted the opinion of all--coming from all departments.  And I said how it would affect the pharmacy department, the problems and things we would have and that type thing.  And the president one day--one day I just had had it.  This particular day the president said, "Oh that's not for you to say.  That's for the head of your department to say."  And I had had it.  I said, "Well why do you think I'm up here?  Do you think I came here on my own?  The head of the department sent me here.  Why do you think I was sent here?"  And you could hear a pin fall.  He didn't know what to say.  And I--in the department I set up an IV [intravenous] department.  I did all the research work and that type of thing.  I set up an IV department.  So I was put in charge of that IV department because the other pharmacist, they didn't know anything about that.  So they got another white youngster coming in there right out of college.  And he was assigned to my department, the IV department.  He didn't wanna work back there because I was in charge of that department.  So the head of the pharmacy department started hee-hawing around and came to me and said,  "Well--" talking about the situation.  He said, "Well why don't we just make both of you head of that department."  Now this might seem ridiculous to you.
Speaker 2: Yeah it does.
Speaker 1: "Why don't we just make both of you head of that department."  I told him--I said, "This is ridiculous."  I said, "Well I'll just do what you don't have the guts to tell me.  I'll just tell you what I'll do myself.  You can give that department to that fellow.  I'll take orthopedics, intensive care and cardiac care. And I'll take those three departments--floors.  Cardiac care, intensive care and orthopedics."  And then they said, "Well that will be fine.  But then also what will happen before he makes any decisions as to what's to be done back there in that IV department, he'll have to get it approved by you."  I was telling you about some of the things I went through.  Some of the things I went through.
Speaker 2: That sounds crazy. Sounds absolutely crazy.
Speaker 1: And that's--and that hadn't been eons--years ago.  That's right on up until--you have doctors and things coming to the pharmacy with questions and things about medication and what not.  They'd walk right by me and go to one of these white individuals.  And that white individual had to turn and come to me to get the answer.  And that soon became--and all the doctors--it wasn't no black doctors in that hospital out there.  They [unclear].  They were aware of that.  Yet they would come if they'd come there, they'd still go to one of those guys and they had to get what I had to say through one of those guys. Also the thing that, you know--so tell you the truth I'm a--I am a better man today and it makes it worse when I have to endure and think of what other people thinks about me and that type of thing.  Now I--getting back to the beginning when I transferred from Ohio to New Jersey, New Jersey was supposed to reciprocate with Ohio.  Supposedly all I had to do was go there and apply for a license in New Jersey.  I had to get a New Jersey license.  But that's all it should have been.  Because I'd been working as a pharmacist in Ohio for what?  Five or six years.  But when I got to New Jersey instead of reciprocating with me, they did it for other pharmacists. I've known other white pharmacists to come from Chicago [Illinois] here and Boston [Massachusetts] there.  Came there and all they did was apply for a New Jersey license and got it.  But with me--you know how they requested for me to get licensed in New Jersey? I had to get authentic documentation from the elementary school that I graduated from, the high school that I graduated from, the college that I graduated from.  I had to get a letter from two of the professors in the college that I graduated from.  And a recommendation from the hospital that I had just left.  They requested all that stuff from me.  Now how in the world did I get through high school?  How did I get through college?  How would I get an Ohio license if I hadn't graduated from college?
Story_ID: 17418
Speaker 1: I just wanna ask you like--after all of these struggles do you think that it's important to, you know--I mean what sense do you think it's important that you let your family know and other people know about these kind of struggles?
Speaker 2: Well one thing, I've written a letter to my daughters.  Hopefully they will understand and keep it so they can pass on to their kids some of these things.  So I don't want--I don't want them to--I want them to always stand tall and keep their chin high and not feel bad about being a black person, and feel that blacks have never done anything, so far as the--I'll tell you something else.  I probably--you might--sound strange if you knew.  But I never pledged allegiance to the flag.  I was among the kids.  I'd put my hand up here. But to this very day I couldn't recite the allegiance to the flag.  I was never interested in learning it.  It didn't mean anything to me.  They sang these little songs about brotherhood and liberty and justice from mountaintops and shiny sea--foamy sea and all this kind of stuff.  Brotherhood.  That stuff didn't mean anything to me.  In a way it doesn't mean anything to me today.  Back there [Texas] I seen a black youngster hanging from a tree.  They lynched blacks back there and nothing was done about it.  It was in effect the law of the land.  Nobody did anything about it.  Today, it's still going on.  Here you take four white cops get a black guy [Amadou Diallo] in a hallway going home from work and fire forty-one bullets or something or whatever number?  Unusual number of bullets--four of them!  Fire that number of rounds of ammunition at one black guy in a hallway where he couldn't go any place!  And just riddle him with bullets and he's coming home from work!  What about this guy down here in Jasper, Texas they dragged him behind his truck 'til he beheaded.  They don't call that lynching, but that's what it is.  Just a few--how many times have I been stopped on a parkway--a turnpike there in New Jersey for no other reason other than I was a black guy.  Stopped me, "Get out of the car."  One guy standing up here and another guy standing off over there with his hand on his pistol, accusing me of some phony things that wasn't true.  "You're zig-zagging all across the road."  Just about a month ago I was stopped right there in New--coming back.  I went over to pick up some papers for my wife and was coming back to the house.  Cops stopped me.  I'm driving and I looked and see lights blinking behind me.  And pull up beside me.  Get out of the car drivers license and insurance and all kind of stuff. "So what happened?"  "You turned at that light up there and that's a dangerous--that's a dangerous area there.  There's a lot of accidents there."  "Well the light was green when I turned."  And they had nothing--you know, that's just some phony thing to stop--and wanted to give me a ticket.  They gave a ticket.  Said, "Well we won't charge you for anything.  You won't get any points or anything on your driver's license, but just pay a little fine and nothing else will go against you on your driving record or your insurance."  You know, this type of thing.  But these things are happening today.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  It's clear to me that you want people to know that racism still exists--.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: --and the country has changed, but not that much in certain circumstances.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Story_ID: 17419
Speaker 1: What value do you think that--
Speaker 2: One--
Speaker 1: --black people today in the situation should uphold and cling to?
Speaker 2: Well the thing about it, these people that--take your entertainers and people other people like--I won't call any names, but people have obtained certain positions, politic positions only for political reasons, don't go into these urban areas where the schools again are predominant black or Latino.  Don't go into these schools and tell these youngsters that study hard, do all the right things, stay away from drugs and all this kind of--gangs and things.  Study hard and you can be anything you wanna be.  That ties my guts up in knots.  Now here you're supposed to be a role model for these people and you go in here telling these youngsters,"You can be anything you wanna be.  If you do all the right things, study hard, apply yourself."  I'm a living example.  I'm not a dinosaur or something.  Did I do what I wanted to do?  The things I worked hard for from a little boy on up for?  Well there's no difference today. You have a few people that have managed to get in certain positions, yeah.  It is somewhat better than it was years ago.  But the playing field is not level out there today.  And to go in and--what that does to a black youngster, he studies hard, a smart youngster, stays away from--do all the right things.  And then he goes out here and he's denied a job or denied something, simply because he's black.  Not because of what he know or he's not capable of doing.  But because he's black.  And what happens to that youngster?  A lot of youngsters are not like me.  I was knocked down time and time again.  I got up and fought.  I taught that I would--I started learning that way back.  I was fortunate enough to have teachers and things that would instill that in me.  I started to play football.  And I went out there I--a guy was--I remember one time I was playing guard.  And the big guy playing just opposite me they called him Spring George (ph.).  "You. We're coming right over you this time."  Sure enough that guy picked me up and threw me about, I don't know, fifteen or twenty feet.  And the play came right over me and they ran almost for a touchdown.  I got up, pulled my helmet off and started on toward the sideline.  'Cause I knew the coach was gonna pull me out of there.  I got right at the sideline, I felt that tall.  Because he yelled back at me, "Where are you--"  I don't wanna say what he said,.  "I didn't tell you to come out of there.  Get on back out there.  You come out of there when I tell you to come out of there."  I went back out there.  I got down on that ground.  They liked to trampled me in the ground there, but he didn't move me out of there.  But things like that.  I was taught--I was told you get down, don't get discouraged.  Get up, fight harder.  Don't lose confidence in yourself.  But youngsters, most of them, are not like me.  They do all the right things.  They certainly all apply themselves--and these barriers are out there.  No mistake about that.  They're still out there.  And they run into some of these barriers. And a lot of 'em will become discouraged, lose confidence in themselves.  And although they're smart, they'll turn--they'll use their brains for something else that's degrading or is detrimental.  They'll use their brain that they got.  They're smart.  But they'll use it for something that's detrimental, not something that's building, you know.  But I've heard too--and I get sick when they say that.  Sure, tell them to study hard.  Do the right thing.  But also let them know what barriers, what pitfalls and things that they--that are out here.  That they may or may not ever run into one of 'em.  But in case they do, know how to deal with it. Don't become discouraged and lose confidence in yourself.

Speaker 1: I wanted to ask you if your parents ever saw--did they live long enough to see you become successful as a pharmacist and were they proud that you finished school?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, oh yeah.
Speaker 1: You were gonna be the first one in your family to get out of school.  Right?
Speaker 2: No my sister.  My sister.  My sister.
Speaker 1: Did she go to college?
Speaker 2: Yeah she went.
Speaker 1: Oh, good.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.  But another thing that hurt me, I was never around where they could see me.  By the time I graduated from college my mother [Victoria Davis] was back in Texas.  My mother would have been proud.  Sure I knew they were proud of me.  But I look at all these youngsters and things around there and all the parents and things there and they're full of joy, you know.  And I look at all of it and I think about my mother.  How she would have felt if she could've been there.  I never thought about my father [George Davis].  My father never came to see me play a game of basketball or football or run track.  He never came to see me play any kind of game.  So my father, he was my father.  But it's not the type of father that I wanted.  And today I have a soft feeling about good kids.  My heart goes out to good kids.  And I've been criticized.  I've been accused of a lot of things just because I'll take up time with a kid that comes across to me as being a good kid.  Because I think of what I wanted from my father and never got, or was never given.  I don't like these bad kids, no.  But a good kid that comes--I can see it in him.  And I've had kids to tell me that their father never said this to them, or never did this.  And that hurts me.  Because I know how I felt about my own--my father really was never there for me.

Speaker 1: How would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: Be remembered?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I really I'd like to be remembered as a guy that saw wrong and tried to right it.  Not only for blacks, but for whites.  I've seen poor whites.  I remember before I left Texas there were poor whites that in effect were treated the same as blacks.  I've seen poor--there was one black doctor in that area.  Dr. Warren.  And I've seen those poor whites--farmers come to Dr. Warren.  Now that's what I like.  If I've--now I've said this before.  If I know I've helped just one individual along the way, then I'll feel that my life has not been in vain.  I'd like to be remembered as a guy that saw wrong and tried to right it.  Tried to help those that couldn't help themselves.  That's the way I'd like to be remembered.  Not as a celebrity or somebody that's got a lot of notoriety or painted as being a--not even as a hero.  But just as a person that wanted to help.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's the way I'd like to be remembered.
