 Finchum Today is October 27, 2014. My name is Tanya Finchum, along with  Alex Bishop. We   re with Oklahoma State University and today we   re in  Tulsa, Oklahoma to speak with John Haws and this is part of our  Oklahoma 100 Year Life project. So thank you for having us today.  Let   s start by having you tell us when and where you were born.  Haws I was born at Gotebo, Oklahoma, while my dad was the Indian agent at  the Rainy Mountain Indian School just south of Gotebo. I was  christened John Francis Haws, Jr. I took the name of Francis until I  graduated from high school and left home. Then I took John because  my father was John.  Finchum When were you born?  Haws September 10, 1914.  Finchum And did you have brothers and sisters?  Haws I had two brothers, two sisters.  Finchum And where were you in the line?  Haws I   m the baby. (Laughs)  Finchum And what did your parents do for a living?  Haws My dad was the Indian agent with the Department of Interior at Gotebo.  Then we moved a lot of times. We moved to Colony  Oklahoma  when  I was about three months old. We stayed there until I was four. We  moved to Kingfisher, Oklahoma. We stayed there for a couple of years,  then we moved to the Fallon Indian Reservation   ten miles out of  5  Fallon, Nevada, and was there for almost two years. I have happy  moments from every place. Then we moved back to Carnegie   Oklahoma  and that was where we stayed so much. About that time  they changed my dad   s title from Indian agent to field clerk to make it a  little bit more sophisticated (laughs) and then life begins. (Laughs)  All the time growing up I had friends. We played. As I got older, about  the age of fourteen, my brother lived in Kingfisher and we were in the  sand and gravel business. So in the summertime I   d go help him. That  was back when they didn   t have motorized trucks to use. You use a  team. The wagon had six-inch timbers with a corner so you could turn it  and dump the sand out the bottom. One evening I was taking the horses  to the barn, big old clumsy horses, Pat and Mike, and they kicked me  right here (gestures), lifted me over the fence. That sounds like  something, but the fence was only this high. (Gestures) My sister-in-law  thought that they   d kicked me in the stomach   poured liniment on me.  Well, you know where it ran to  Wooooo    (Laughter)  I moved forward there. I   ve done a lot of things I was told not to do.  Back when we were at Colony and I was three years old, one Sunday  evening Dad went down to the barn to milk. I went with him, and like  all children   they climb on tools, everything that you can do like that.  Well my dad told me to stay off of it, but I climbed up on a disc. A lot  of people today don   t even know what a disc is, but I slipped and fell  and I had a mark right here. (Gestures to forehead) They took me to the  doctor, and back in those days the only medicine you had was iodine  and they poured that on that. I thought my head was going to burn off.  (Laughter) Then, like I said, or maybe I haven   t said it, but I have been  blessed every day of my life. I   ve been watched over. I   ll get into  something else a little bit later on and tell you an experience that   s  unusual.  Finchum Okay. Well where did you go to school?  Haws Well, I was in kindergarten at Kingfisher. When we lived in Fallon,  Nevada, the Indian school was about from here to the street from our  house. It was a duplex where the teacher lived on the other side. I  wasn   t able to go to that school. I rode a horse five miles to Stillwater     Stillwater, Nevada, by the road. In the wintertime, when the sluice  wasn   t bringing water down from the mountains when the snow was  melting, because everything was irrigated out there, I could cut through  and go down this sluice and back up on the other side. It was only about  three and a half miles. There wasn   t any fences. It was just sagebrush  and a trail that had been used by others before me. So we could go  across there and down in this and up over to the school.  6  Going the long route, two of my friends would meet me down on a  section corner and we   d all ride to school together. At this little  settlement there was the doctor, his wife was the nurse. There was a  little Baptist mission with two missionaries, my dad, mother, me, and  the schoolteacher. All of the kids that went to school there, they were  my friends and I played with them all the time.  Finchum What would you do with your horse while you were in class?  Haws Tie him up outside. When I was there, one afternoon all the kids ran  outside watching a foal being born. We got a first class education right  there. (Laughter)  Finchum So when you moved away from there where would you go to school?  Take us on through your school.  Haws Well, I was heading to Carnegie, and there was a lot of life behind that  that I can tell you about. (Laughs)  Finchum Tell me if you want to. Go to it.  Haws Along about 1926 there was an oil boom up in Pawnee County. My dad  had made the run for the Cherokee Strip at Pawnee, north of Pawnee,  called Masham now, was where he homesteaded. There was a little oil  boom. Pawnee Bill came down and stayed two days trying to talk my  dad into selling the farm, but dad never did go in   give up. Anyway,  my folks had always been furnished a house while my dad was working  for the government. They built a new house there at Carnegie and one  of the things next to us was a cobbled   on the next corner was a  cobblestone filling station. Do you know what cobblestone is?  Finchum I know what a   go ahead.  Haws They   re round stores about like this. (Gestures) They   re more or less  down in the Wichita Mountains. I looked for it a couple of years when I  went out there, but it   s a Dairy Queen now   all different. But on this  new house everything was coal. We had a room down in the basement  that they   d dump the coal in. After we got natural gas and it was all  cleaned out, that was my workshop. I put a workbench in there and  liked to fool with woodworking. I still have my three chisels, wood  chisels, my draw knife, my brace and bit that I used making different  things.  But before I was that old, when I was younger in grade school, two of  my friends that I played with all the time, we were cowboys. I was  Ken   (Laughs) I just lost his name  Maynard , but anyway one of them  7  was Hoot Gibson and another one I don   t remember, but the other two  boys were both well-known pediatricians. One in Muskogee  Emil  Stratton  and one up in the state of Washington, and here I ended up  pushing a pencil. We had, a lot of times, a lot of fun. I was sneaky  (Laughter). The grade school was two blocks up the hill and I had a  sweet tooth. So I talked my mother out of a couple of pennies. Instead  of going to school I   d backtrack and go to Gosselin   s Variety Store.  That was Ace Gosselin. That was the    G    of TG Y.  Finchum Okay.  Haws And I   d get two or three pennies worth of chocolate stars. That was my  favorite, and now I got to go back to school (laughs) and share it with  the other kids.  Bishop Was this is in Carnegie?  Haws That was in Carnegie. I spent more time in Carnegie, most of my life.  So I   m a full-fledged    Okie.    (Laughter)  Finchum Is that where you graduated high school?  Haws I graduated from high school; in fact, that   s my picture. (Gestures)  There were only thirty-three of us in the class.  Finchum Nineteen     Haws Thirty-three.  Bishop Well what was the Depression like? That was around the Depression  years.  Haws The Depression   as soon as the Depression hit, the banks closed. That  made it hard on farmers because they didn   t have the money. Since Dad  had a government check, the grocery store   that was the first time that  they ever put charge tickets. They   d have a charge book. You go in and  you   d buy your groceries and they   d list everything. Then when you got  your paycheck, got some money, you could pay it off.  I learned something the other day. After my dad died, I was executor  and I have a sack over here of things that he used. He was a record  keeper. You   d think he was a bookkeeper. Because money was so tight,  he kept record of every nickel. I   ve got some records over there that I   m  keeping, but if he spent a dime for a loaf of bread, he wrote it down.  Then at the end of the month he   d find out how much he spent and how  much he had. He was a farmer. While he was in the service he  rented   8  the farm   rented it out on a crop-share so he had a little bit of income  there. But when you get a check for sixty-five dollars a month, it  doesn   t    go very far. I don   t think he was making that much when the  Depression hit. Money hasn   t been like this, and now they think nothing  of giving state officials too much. I won   t say    (Laughs)  Finchum He was in World War I, your father?  Haws No. He was too old. My brother was in World War I.  Finchum You said,    While he was in the service        Haws Indian Service.  Finchum Indian Service. Okay, gotcha.  Haws My brother was in the First World War. He was a cook and was always  stationed in Kansas. He didn   t get to go over and fight.  Finchum Well when you got out of high school, what did you do?  Haws Well, while I was still in high school JC Penney Company opened a  store there. There were a bunch of boys, besides me, trying to get a job.  There was the manager, the assistant manager, the bookkeeper, and a  woman clerk. I got the job helping to stock the store, and then I was a  clerk for a dollar a day. That was after I got my raise.  Bishop Oh my gosh. (Laughter)  Haws We worked eight hours a day. During cotton season we   d work twelve  to fourteen hours a day. You   ve heard of the NRA  National Regulatory  Authority ? Yeah, it came along and restricted us to sixty hours a week.  Then later they cut it to   one Saturday my boss came to me and said,     Francis, you   ve already put too much time in. You can go home,    and  that was at ten o   clock on Saturday morning, our busiest days. Before  that, while I was in high school I got out and picked cotton. We pulled  cotton out of the bolls.  Finchum Hard work.  Haws Hard work, dragging an eighteen-foot canvas bag. You got a penny a  pound for the cotton.  Finchum What was the most you picked in one day?  Haws I don   t remember. I spent it. (Laughs)  9  Finchum Well why would you work longer during cotton-picking season at the  store?  Haws Well, that was before.  Finchum Okay.  Haws Then   I   m kind of jumping around a little bit. After I graduated I went  up to Oklahoma A M, that little college over here at Stillwater, with  two other boys. We got partially enrolled, but I didn   t know what I was  going to do. I just signed up for freshman classes. I went to the JC  Penney store, since I had previously worked for Penney. I told them I  needed a part-time job, so I got a job. They said,    We   ll fund you.    The  people that had the store over at Masham, there in Pawnee County, they  lived in Stillwater. They had a big house, and they rented rooms out to  the male students. So I made arrangements to stay at their house. So  there I was partially enrolled. I had a job and a place to stay. I went  back home and one of those hotshot salesmen for Hills Business  University called on me and sold me on going to Hills, because I could  get out in the business world earlier than going four years at Oklahoma  A M. So I went to Hills Business University. (Laughs)  Finchum And when did you graduate from there?  Haws In    35.  Finchum So two years.  Bishop Was that in Oklahoma City, that business school?  Haws It was in Oklahoma City, 619 West Main. I think it   s still there.  Anyway     Bishop In terms of marriage, were you married during that time or     Haws Well, there at Hills Business University we had big classrooms. I was  taking the accounting section and my boss told me, there at Carnegie,  he says,    Francis, you   re too much of an outdoorsman. You   ll never  work in an office,    but I did. (Laughs) Anyway, we had these desks,  full-size adult desks, two of them together. Mine was number 266. One  day there was a girl walking down the aisle. She got next to me,  dropped her pencil. I had to reach over and get it, when I looked up I  saw those very blue eyes. She was going with the state president of the  DeMolay (masonic organization). He asked her, he said,    Do you know  10  John Haws?    She said,    No.    He said,    Well, look him up.    Well, she  did. She got me. (Laughter)  Finchum What was her name?  Haws Ruth Wanda Bookout.  Finchum Bookout?  Haws Bookout.  Finchum That   s an unusual last name   Bookout.  Haws Right. She was from Hartshorne  Oklahoma . Her dad and her brother  had a garage and distributorship for McAlester, in that area, of the     well, Mid-Continent Petroleum.  Bishop Did you two ever go out on any dates?  Haws Yes. The first date we had I took her to a show   out to dinner. That   s  when you could go to a restaurant and they had the meals family style.  They kept bowls full of food, I think it was a plate dinner. After that we  went to one of the shows there in Oklahoma City. On the way home she  said,    This has been the happiest birthday I   ve ever had.    She says,    It   s  my birthday.    I said,    Me too.    (Laughter) She said,    I don   t believe  you.    (Laughs) So, to make a short story long, JC Penney Company  opened in Oklahoma City, their first store. Well, I got a job helping set  up the men   s work clothes department. I hurt my back trying to lift one  of those dollies of clothes because the elevator wasn   t quite level. She  went with me out to Carnegie on the bus and asked my mother about  my birthday. (Laughs) Mom said,    Yeah, that   s right.    (Laughter)  Finchum She still didn   t believe you?  Bishop You shared the same birthday.  Haws We have the same   she was ninety-nine the day I was one-hundred. So  on down the line when we had my 100th birthday, I had a special cake  baked (crying) for her birthday.  Bishop The ultimate question is how did you pop the question to her? Did you  do anything special?  Haws I don   t know, I think we just sort of flew around it. (Laughter) I don   t  think I asked her. (Laughs) See, life   s been fun all my life. (Laughs)  11  Finchum Well did you elope to get married or have a     Haws No, we wanted to get married on our birthdays, but she was working for  an insurance company that didn   t allow married women to work for the  company. So she had to keep it quiet, still. We got married on Saturday  before Labor Day. She had to work until two o   clock that afternoon.  She hurried home, changed clothes; we already had the bags packed and  everything. Preacher was late, we got married at Saint Luke   s   the old  Saint Luke   s Methodist Church in Oklahoma City. The preacher from  Carnegie, one of my friends there, was   I asked him to be our preacher.  He married us there. He took us down to the depot after the ceremony.  Oh, I hadn   t gotten Ruth flowers or anything, and while we were  waiting on him I went to the flower shop down on the corner and I  couldn   t get back. When I got back, they were waiting on me.  Then we got on a train, went all the way to Fort Worth, took a bus back  over to Dallas. It was the Texas centennial. Got in there at one o   clock  in the morning, checked in at the hotel or I thought I was. They said,     We cancelled your reservation.    Now I   d had it for three weeks,  already promised. One of the company men down in Dallas had taken  care of it for me. I said,    Well we just got married, we had a train trip to  Fort Worth, now we   re here on a bus. We couldn   t get here any sooner.  There was no way to tell you that we were closing in on it.    So he  started calling different hotels for vacancies. He didn   t find any. So the  last people, the people that he had rented a room to, he evacuated them,  moved them out. And it had twin beds. (Laughter) So we pushed the  beds together. (Laughter)  Finchum And what year was that?  Haws That was 1936.  Finchum Thirty-six.  Haws September 5, 1936. (Laughs) And the next month   incidentally I was  working for Fruehauf Trailer Company. It   s a hard name, F-R-U-E-H-A-  U-F. (Laughs) I had to learn how to spell it. (Laughter) I was the  office manager there in Oklahoma City. They were opening a branch in  Tulsa, so I was transferred to Tulsa in October of    36. Well, here was  Ruth working in Oklahoma City, I was working in Tulsa. One weekend  I   d drive my Model A over to Oklahoma City. The next weekend she  gets an Oklahoma Transportation bus back to Tulsa. We didn   t like that.  Finally she said,    This has got to end.     So the company was having a Christmas party, and she had let one of  the girls that she worked with know that she was married. So they kind  12  of surprised her. They had little diploma like things with our wedding  date and everything (laughs) for a place marker. Anyway, when her  boss walked in (laughs),    Why didn   t you tell me? We could have kept  it secret from the home office. (Laughs) I wanted to keep you one more  year     I tell you, life   s been a scream. (Laughs) Do you find many  people this old that   s had the fun that I have? (Laughs)  Finchum No. So I take it she found a job in Tulsa and moved here?  Haws Well, then that   s another story. (Laughs) In 1938 Fruehauf decided that  they would close the factory branch here in Tulsa. We were out on  Charles Page Boulevard across from Celia Clinton School, 2111 South  Nogales. I had a two-week notice and while I had that, my boss was  letting me try to find another job. I had my application at two or three  different employment agencies. I went to the typewriter place because I  like mechanics, wanted to learn how to service office machines. Then I  went to several of the other companies. I had about seven or eight  places that kind of looked favorable, and then one afternoon up popped  National Tank Company. One of the employment agencies found out  about it.  So I call my wife, I couldn   t get her. She and the landlady were sitting  out in the backyard, it was in February, sitting outside in the backyard  enjoying the sunshine. Our apartment was down at Eighteenth and  Boston, right across the street from the old fire station that   s still there. I  finally told my boss that I needed a ride out to National Tank Company.  He says,    Where is that?    I said,    Somewhere on the Sand Springs  Road, the Sand Springs line.    He said,    I   ll take you out there.    So we  finally found the place. I went in, met Frank Baker, the secretary and  treasurer, because it was an application for the accounting department. I  gave him my resume, he saw Hills Business University. He said,    I  graduated there, too. I know what they do.    Well there was about seven  or eight other fellows that were applying for the same job, as typists.  Finally he said,    We   ll call someone in the next week or so.    Got me  out of bed the next morning.  So I had to find my way out there. Jay P. Walker was the president,  Cecil G. Wells was vice president, F.W. Baker was secretary and  treasurer. Well Baker   s the one that hired me. I park in the boss   s   I  park in J.P. Walker   s parking place. (Laughs) So when he got there  someone came in and says,    John, you   re going to have to go move  your car. (Laughs) You   re in Mr. Walker   s place.    (Laughs)  Finchum They didn   t fire you though.  13  Haws No. There was a total of five of us in the accounting department,  counting Mr. Baker, the secretary. Gus Wilde was a typist, and then I  was the second metal typist. John Calvert was   what was his job? Then  Lloyd Taylor was paymaster, but John Calvert had something to do  with personnel. I made   counting engineers in the accounting  department, we had the secretary, to meet people at the front door, one  purchasing agent, the rest of them were engineers. I made the eleventh  employee. Then one time we had over 400 in one of our office  buildings.  Finchum How long did you stay there?  Haws Until 1980, January 1.  Finchum Retired from there then.  Haws Yeah. When I first started out we typed, we entered, we had large sales  record books. Oh, John Calvert was the one that paid the bills. (Laughs)  Anyway, we didn   t    have a credit department so I got acquainted with  some of the credit managers over at Frick Reid, Lucy Products,  Schlumberger, all the big oil supply companies. I got acquainted with  them and started checking credit on some of our customers. Well, that  was the beginning of the credit department.  Finally, I was invited to join the group. So we had annual meetings, we  traveled all over the country. We started out down at Lake Murray, then  down to Dallas, Denver, Colorado Springs, and all like that. Well, in  1965, when National Tank Company sold out to Combustion  Engineering, they elected the general counsel and me as officers. He  was secretary and I was assistant secretary, so I had full responsibility  of the collection. Another story I   ll tell you    (Laughs)  Finchum Did you get your own parking place when you got to become one of  the     Haws Yeah, you might as well say that.  Finchum Okay.  Haws I was an early bird. (Laughs) But the plant, it was out on Charles Page  Boulevard, on the south side of the road. Our laboratory was to the big  building in the back. Would you believe that motorboats used to go up  and down Sand Springs Road in front of our office, and logs this big  around, about chunks like this (gestures) would float up next to our  window outside the building when we had the floods? That was before  we had the levees there on the Arkansas. Our tanks that were stored in  14  the road across the street would get up and float. Now where was I?  (Laughs)  Bishop So for your career, you worked in an office.  Haws I was in an office all the time.  Bishop But you said that you were told that you were an outdoorsman. You  would never have an indoor job.  Haws That   s what the boss told me.  Bishop Did you continue to do things outside of work, like be an outdoorsman,  do outdoors-type of activities?  Haws Yes. I spent about twenty-five years in scouting.  Bishop What did you do in scouting? Were you a scoutmaster? Were you     Haws Yes.  Bishop    hanging out with the children or     Haws I was fourteen when I joined the Boy Scouts at Carnegie. In 1936, in the  summer, there was a new troop being started in Oklahoma City. Troop  9 or   it   s either 9 or 41. I was only there until October and I had to  leave and come to Tulsa. Then my work at National Tank Company  was pretty heavy, now I   d go back and work at night. One day, one  evening, I was headed back to work down at Twenty-first and Harvard.  There were two boy scouts waiting for the bus so I asked them where  they were going. They said,    Boston Avenue to a troop meeting.    I said,     I   m going to Boston Avenue. Hop in. I   ll take you down there.     My wife and I joined Boston Avenue  United Methodist Church  in  January of    37. We were charter members of the Young Peoples    class,  and when it disbanded we were the only living couple. But anyway,  getting back to scouting, I went in and saw what they were doing, first  thing I knew I was on the troop committee and assistant scoutmaster.  (Laughs) Then in    44 I was made scoutmaster and was scoutmaster  through    48. Then for one year I was post advisor. That was for the  seniors. It goes on and on and on.  Finchum Ever get the Silver Beaver?  Haws Never did and I think I figured out why. I was asked that question and  after I left Troop 20 as post advisor, I remained on the troop committee.  15  Then my son got old enough to be a cub scout. So up here at Lanier   Elementary School  he joined the Cub Scouts. Dick Grace was the  cubmaster and while he was there one of the projects we had was this  Statue of Liberty up at Nineteenth and Harvard. The three scout troops  at East Side Christian Church (Troop 53, 54, and 56) and Pack 12 raised  the funds to pay for that. National Tank Company built the base   no, I  take that all back. Otis Nagifer built the base. National Tank raised the  statue with a gin pole truck. It was quite a celebration. Anyway, that  statue had to stay in the little garage out here for thirty days while we  were getting the rest of the money to pay for it. (Laughs) Then, first  thing I knew I was cubmaster. Then after Phil went to scouting, he  didn   t go back down to Boston Avenue Troop 20. He went over to  Troop 54 at East Side Christian, because that   s where his friends were  going. He was on the rifle team over there. He   s been an active guy.  Bishop And Phil   s your son?  Haws Phil? John Phillip. (Laughs) Like I said before, we   ve got a string of  Johns and a few James mixed in-between.  Bishop So scouting was a big part of your middle-adult years.  Haws My middle-adult it was. So, first thing I knew I was assistant  scoutmaster of 54. (Laughs) Then as he grew a little older   and in the  meantime I was active as a neighborhood commissioner with several  areas. At the last of it   to start with, there were two districts: the north  and the south. It was the Tulsa Area Boy Scout Council. Now it   s the  Indian Nations. Jack Lores and Bob Garrison were the two main minds  that I know about. They tried to get me to go to work for them, but  about that time is when the war was going on. Then they finally made a  third district which was the Frisco tracks going north. The tracks  coming out this way, on over into Rogers County: that was all the East  District. So I was the First District commissioner.  And you asked me a question, why I never did get the Silver Beaver.  Well, I guess it was because I was at so many different places for so  long a time that they lost track of me, but I never did get it. (Laughs)  Finchum So you were in scouts during World War II?  Haws I was in scouting.  Finchum Did you do victory gardens?  16  Haws We had victory gardens. In fact, I dug up a space out here that was  about ten feet wide and twenty-five feet in that corner of my flowerbed.  That was my victory garden.  Finchum So you moved in this house in 1940     Haws Forty-one.  Finchum Forty-one.  Haws December 7 I was in the kitchen scrubbing the woodwork. Our son was  four months old. I stopped at a little restaurant over there at Eleventh  and Denver   Eleventh and Lewis to get my lunch, and I got lunch to  take home to Ruth. The announcement came over the air that Pearl  Harbor was being attacked.  Finchum You remember that quite vividly.  Haws I sure do. Then they came along with the draft. Of course, when it  comes to winning something I   m the last one. They had 8,500 numbers  in the draft and I think my number was eighty-three something. So  finally they got to me. I was called up, I took my physical, the Army  doctor said,    I   ll take Haws.    The Navy doctor spoke up and said,    I   m  sorry, I   ve already had him for three weeks.    The Army doctor didn   t  know that the Navy doctor was a brother to my boss there at National  Tank. So we already had that cooked up. (Laughter) So I had everything  turned over to the wife, made an application for support for the wife,  and just waiting for my records of where I   d be going. Then Congress  signed a bill that any man over twenty-nine with small children would  be reclassified to 1A. So I got kicked out of the Navy right quick. I  didn   t get to serve. I was ready.  Finchum So you have one child?  Haws We had one child.  Finchum Okay.  Haws Four grandchildren, nine great-grandchildren.  Finchum Well let   s back up and let you tell me how your father came to be in  Oklahoma, where he came from and how he got here.  Haws Okay. My ancestry, like I said, was in Virginia, south of Woodstock,  there on the big river. He received a three hundred acre plantation  from   if I wasn   t planning on telling you, I could tell you. Anyway, it  17  was a big landowner that had so much land. He got a three hundred acre  plantation donated to him. He died in 1811 at Haws Crossroads. They  had eleven children. The seventh one was James Haws. Along with that  group there were Haws, H-A-W-S, and H-A-W-E-S. So I followed the  H-A-W-S. I have more on the H-A-W-S and the H-A-W-E-S side than I  have of my own. Mine, it came right down in a hurry.  There was James Haws that married Nancy Hale. The Hale family came  here in 1662. Then the next one comes along, was John Haws, born in  1823, he married Nancy Russell. I got a bunch of Nancys. Then James  Montgomery Haws married Margaret Melvina Easterly. They are the  ones that lived in the   what is now the museum of President Johnson  there in Greeneville  Tennessee , across the street from the Tailor Shop.  They were living there and in the spring of 1872 they moved toward  Oklahoma. They were going to Kansas first, I think through the  Overland Trail. They were in line with a wagon train, but my  grandfather and grandmother took the train. My grandmother was  pregnant with my dad. So they got as far as Decatur, Illinois and had to  make a stopover so my dad could be born. (Laughs) Then after they  were there a few weeks they went the rest of the way down to I want to  say Edna up in Kansas, just north of the line. They were there a while  then they moved into Payne County at Terlton.  They had farms. My two uncles   the whole family came by wagon  train down to Kansas. My great-grandfather was already in Logan  County there north of Guthrie. So they were sooners. Then as I said  earlier, when they had the Cherokee Strip my dad, I   m repeating  myself, and his future brother-in-law and two other outlaws made the  Run. They land up at Orlando and headed north. They all settled up  around Ponca City and over around where Pawnee is. Dad came back to  Guthrie. His girlfriend, Fannie Florence Ellison, lived across the road  from Lawrie Cemetery. Lawrie was a whistle-stop. Then December 23,  1893   I have to get the century right. It   s at the point now that I can   t  say,    Fourteen.       Which year?    (Laughter)  Finchum Your turn Alex.  Bishop Well, I was curious because you know a lot about genealogy and  history. It   s kind of a hobby for you. You   re a member of the, what I  understand, the Sons of the American Revolution, SAR.  Haws I am a member of the Sons of the Revolution   by accident. (Laughs)  Bishop Can you tell us a little bit about that? How you got involved?  18  Haws Well, I   d been working on my genealogy since 1940. I   d pick up a little  bit here, a little bit there, a little bit more. I   d heard about Sons of the  American Revolution, but I didn   t know how to get a hold of them. My  youngest grandson was a student at Union High School. He was picked  as the Outstanding Junior High Student to represent the school by the  Sons of the American Revolution. So Grandma and I went. I found out  who they were. I got the man   s name, and before you know it I was a  member. (Laughs) I came in under John Parrott, then I had Shadrack  Hale, and one that they have taken out now which was   Anyway, I  finally got six, counting my original one   five different ancestors, a  total of six. After about a year I had gone through the   about two years,  I joined in    90, and in the next two years I was an officer of one kind.  Then in 1993 was made the leader of the Tulsa chapter of SAR.  Bishop So you were the president of the SAR.  Haws I was the president of it. Then is when the work started. We didn   t have  a calling committee and we didn   t have this or that. Fred Fulkerson was  the previous president and he was a wonderful helper. He would  suggest things that they wanted to do before, but they never did get  done. So I stepped forward and we did them.  Bishop What kind of things does the SAR do?  Haws The main project is heritage, American heritage. Our national  headquarters are in Louisville, Kentucky. They have recently built a  large library. They   re trying to get all the lost records of history. It   s just  teaching leadership to young men. We have an Eagle Scout program. I  was chairmen of the Eagle Scout program for ten years. I turned it over  to Bill Gaddis who has had it now for about ten years. His son   well,  my grandson who actually was responsible for me getting into SAR,  was the winner of the state program one time and received a big eagle  scout.  Bishop Are you still an active member today?  Haws I   m still on the board   judging committee of the applications. We  started out giving, the Tulsa chapter, we would give an eagle and  100.  Now I think it   s  500. The national was originally  1,000 and it is   8,000 to the winning essay and actual scouting work. We had one boy  in Troop 20 that was the national winner. He was the son of Bill  Gaddis, who assumed my spot in SAR, and is now state chairman of the  Eagle Scout Program. We have the ROTC  Reserves Officers    Training  Corps  Program. We do a lot for the veterans. Each time that there   s an  Honor Flight, the honor guard, color guard, is out seeing them off and  we   re welcoming them home.  19  Finchum And you do that?  Haws I haven   t. I   m limited in transportation.  Bishop What kind of events do you go to today?  Haws Well I   m active at the meetings. I go with them over to Ponca City  where we had the dedication for the English airmen that took training  there. We give honor to the men that died while they were taking the  training. There   s also one over at Bartlesville, I think it is. I haven   t  made the Bartlesville. At my age it   s too hard to get out and walk.  Bishop Do you do anything at local schools or like things that?  Haws Oh, the SAR for the Tulsa chapter we used to go to the neighborhood  schools out at Broken Arrow. I don   t think we ever went to Jenks. We  went to Catoosa, several Tulsa schools, and put on a patriotic program  explaining the history of George Washington. Our uniforms of the  Tulsa Color Guard are those of George Washington. Incidentally the  last, or one of my ancestors that I have, was a member of Washington   s  army at Valley Forge during the winter of    83. His wife, Ellen Ryan,  was supposed to be 100 years old plus fourteen, 114. I have others that  are 106, 102, 101, 100, 99     Bishop What do you attribute your longevity to? What   s your secret?  Haws The Lord   s given it to me. I   ve been blessed every day of my life.  People ask me,    What   s your secret?    I don   t have a secret, it   s all my  life.  Finchum And genetics, if you have all those in your background.  Haws I   m like Will Rogers, I like my friends. (Laughs)  Finchum Did you ever think you would make it to 100?  Haws Well that was my goal.  Finchum Was it?  Haws Yeah.  Finchum Now what   s your goal?  Haws One hundred and twenty.  20  Finchum One hundred and twenty, okay. I hope I   m here to see it.  Haws Well you should be. You   re just a youngster. (Laughter)  Bishop Well what   s a typical day like you today at 100?  Haws My typical life right now?  Bishop Typical day, yes.  Haws I get up of the morning     Bishop What time?  Haws Well it depends. I used to get up at six o   clock every morning. My son,  the night my wife died, started staying with me at night. He lives out  near Thirty-first and Garnett, he and his family, his wife, his daughter,  and grandson. He stays with me at night and leaves in the morning. I   m  here alone all day long, but if we   re up late watching a  Oklahoma City   Thunder game or the  Tulsa  Shock game, I may not get up until seven-thirty.  On Saturday mornings he likes to sleep late, so I may not get up  until eight o   clock. I lay in there. (Laughs)  Bishop So when you   re here by yourself what do you do?  Haws When I   m here by myself? Well, before I get out of bed I take my leg  stretching exercises, my arm exercises. You can see my weights. I take  one out here, both arm and leg. I got a Cardio Glide over there in the  corner I used to use. You noticed I said,    used to.    I   ll sit here and look  at it, but I ought to go over there and pull, but I don   t. (Laughter)  Anyway, after that I get my walker to stable myself, walk to the front  door, get the paper, bring it in, go in and fix my breakfast, come out, eat  breakfast. By that time the news is on. When I get through with that I   ll  come in and get my paper.  During the day I   ll work on my genealogy. That   s why I got all my stuff  down here. I had an office upstairs that I built over the garage   goes up  with a folding-down stairway. I had two filing cases full of records, two  bookcases full. I brought everything downstairs so I would have it here.  So I had to put it in these little storage boxes. I   ve got one over there  that takes care of all my National Tank, my different companies. They  have changed hands so many times I can   t keep up with them. ABB is  the last one that is paying me. I have to keep those metal boxes like that  one, this one over here. There   s one up here on the record player, one  on the corner. I   ve got another one out in the computer room. I had to  21  bring everything down. So it   s kind of hard for me to keep up with  which one   s which. (Laughs) That one   s all my things that I have  contracts with: insurance, paid bills, things like that. Then the rest of it  is all the, more or less, genealogy.  Finchum And you have a computer room?  Haws Oh yeah.  Finchum Do you use the computer?  Haws I use it to play    sol     solitaire . I   ll show you my book that I wrote in  2005. I put together   the kids said,    Grandpa, tell us some of the stories  that you have in your life.    I have it on my Haws line. I have a cousin  that   Greeneville, Tennessee, that has the same thing on the Easterly  family. The Easterly Farm has been in the same ownership for over 100  years. They   re at Mosheim  Tennessee .  Finchum Mosheim?  Haws Mosheim, is that how you pronounce it?  Finchum M-O-S-H     Haws I-E-M.  Finchum That   s where my mother-in-law   s from   Mosheim.  Haws Then she   s familiar with Oven Creek...  Finchum I   ll ask her.  Haws    Church.  Finchum Okay.  Haws See? One of my uncles donated that church. That   s home country, but I  haven   t been there.  Finchum You need to go.  Haws You ask me about my future. I   m beginning to get interested more. I   ve  asked my son if he will schedule a vacation so we can go back to  Greeneville next summer sometime.  Finchum Good.  22  Bishop You   ve got that on your bucket list.  Haws That   s one of my goals.  Finchum So what   s the biggest invention in your lifetime, do you think?  Haws What was the biggest invention?  Finchum Yes.  Haws They   re still coming. (Laughs) I learned to drive a Model T Ford when  I   my dad would be going out to service certain areas, and of course  there weren   t paved roads. It was usually a single rut and you   d have to  get out of the  rut  when you did meet a car. See, everything went down  the middle of the road. I learned how to drive a Model T Ford by  steering it in the ruts. (Laughter) Now, they   ve got cars that you tell it,     Go so-and-so    and you lean back, you don   t do anything. I   m scared of  them. I want the wheel. (Laughter) Even the Bible prophecy, you  remember there   s one place in the Bible that tells about the birds flying  with fire coming out of their tails. That was your jets  There   s been so  many things since the horse and buggy.  Bishop You told us earlier, when we first started talking, that you had an  experience that you were going to tell us about later that you kind of     was a little bit of a mysterious experience.  Haws Well, I   ve been cut open a lot of times. That may have been one of  them. I started out with a   well after I had a few hernias, I ruptured an  appendix. It was on a Thursday before Easter. The doctor thought it was  intestinal flu. On Saturday I was hurting so bad I went back to the  doctor, found my doctor in the office. He said,    Just a minute,    and he  called a surgeon in and he says,    I think he might have appendicitis.     The surgeon said,    Well let   s put him in the hospital for observation  over the weekend.    I said,    No.    My son had had a hernia operation   I  said,    I got my own surgeon.    So my doctor called him and explained  what it was. He says,    Get to Saint Francis. Don   t go home.     It   s another time I disobeyed. I went out to National Tank Company,  got my checkbook, and my box that I had my personal items in. Wife  drove sixty miles an hour down Riverside Drive getting out to Saint  Francis. They had already closed down the operating room, but they  were in the process of reactivating it. It was just a matter of minutes,  you might say, before I was in there on the operating  table . For three  days they didn   t expect me to live. They worried about me.  23  At that time at National I was doing all the collecting. I   d have my big  list of people that were behind that I   d been writing on. At that time I  was assistant secretary. So the secretary, or general counsel, would  bring   and a little bit later on would bring my paperwork out there and  I would dictate the collection letters to him. His secretary would have to  write them. (Laughs) Then more hernias and I had a ruptured  gallbladder. I don   t have normal things. Then it was about the size of a  small egg. The doctor said it was the largest stone in there that he had  ever seen. I still got the darn thing in there, but it   s shriveled about like  that now. (Laughter)  Finchum And yet you   re still here.  Haws I am still here. Then in 2011, I think it was, I had a triple bypass and it  was a new style. It was the Beating Heart. They didn   t put me on a  machine and shut my heart down. They used my own heart. When they  were doing the angioplasty, or whatever it is, coming up here checking  the arteries the doctor said,    Mr. Haws       I was watching. He said,     Mr. Haws, you   re going to have to lean back. We can   t see what we   re  doing.    (Laughter)  Bishop You were pretty curious about it.  Haws I was serious  I wanted to see what was happening to my heart   (Laughs) Anyway, Dr. Miller went ahead and operated. They did a new  technique. Before, on surgeries like that, they always took the artery out  between the knee and the ankle. Well they took it out in my thigh. I  didn   t have one bit a problem with it, where other people always had  problems with the other. Well anyway, to make a long story short, I   m  going to have them put a zipper in next time. It goes from here down to  the pelvis bone. When they got up to the navel they just went around it,  made a detour. (Laughs) That   s why I say I have been blessed every day  of my life.  Bishop Do you have a motto or a philosophy that you live by?  Haws Live each day the best you can. That   s why I go over to the senior  center. I   ll go over there two, three times a week. You asked what I did  during the day; I play cards, dominoes, different kinds of card games.  We have a place to walk and a gymnasium. Every Tuesday we have a  lunch or a breakfast of some kind. On Fridays we have a    grumpy  man   s breakfast,    women are invited.  Bishop What   s a    grumpy man   s breakfast?     Haws Biscuits and gravy.  24  Bishop But what do you mean by a    grumpy man   s breakfast?     Haws Well they call it a    grumpy breakfast.    We added the    man    to it. We  play pitch. We have our own band     Finchum Do you dance?  Haws Yeah, when we have parties. I danced with the coordinator of our unit at  my ninety-ninth birthday, and again at my hundredth birthday. They  were both held at the same place, over at the Western Country Diner on  Sheridan. We had about seventy-six for my ninety-ninth, a hundred and  twenty for my hundredth.  Finchum Did you and your wife dance when you were     Haws We belonged to ballroom dancing. We belonged to square-dance. We  belonged to the Woodland Country Club, which was out near Mohawk.  They had a nine-hole golf course, swimming pool. We were on a  committee, an entertainment committee, out there. We used to belong to  two bridge clubs. There   s another story. (Laughs)  Finchum Well did she work? Did Ruth work?  Haws She worked for about two months after she came to Tulsa. Then she  decided that it wasn   t worth it. I started out at  100 a month, and I  started getting raises about every two or three weeks, two weeks or a  month. She said,    Well, you   re making enough now we won   t need  mine.    We   d go to the fifteen cent movie. There was the Cozy down on  the overpass of the train track. Then the Gem was back about Sixth and  Main. We had the Ritz, Orpheum, Rialto, Criterion.  Finchum Go to any drive-ins? Drive-in movies?  Haws I used to go to the movie out on Admiral   Admiral Twin.  Finchum Did you go dancing at the Cain   s Ballroom?  Haws I   ve never been there.  Finchum Well Tulsa   s changed a lot in sixty, seventy years.  Haws Yeah it has. I had one experience during my scouting years. One of our  previous scouts   right now I can   t remember. His name has caught  wings, but we were his guests at a war bond rally down at the old Brady  Theater. Red Skelton was the entertainment, and he   s as funny off the  25  stage as he is on. We had a lot of famous women singers and high up  Navy and Army officers. Anyway, I got acquainted with both Red and  Edna  Skelton  and got their autographs on the eight and a half by  fourteen worksheet for the stagehands.  Bishop Pretty neat.  Finchum Yeah, had a good life.  Bishop Well one thing we didn   t ask you, and this is going back again, but what  did you do for fun as a child? Did you play any particular games or     Haws In school? I was too busy working at schoolwork. I did a lot of  woodwork, I made a   one of my projects was a secretary desk that  folded a lid down. It   s out in the computer room. (Laughs)  Bishop You still have it.  Haws Yeah, and I got one upstairs identical to it that I made in the kitchen     out of oak. Made it for my granddaughter. The wife talked me into  painting it white.  Bishop Did you have any family traditions or types of things you used to do  during the holidays?  Haws Yeah, whenever they have the    89er   s Day in April over at Guthrie, the  Haws and the Ellisons always had a family reunion. We   d meet there at  Highland Park, have a picnic. Course, had to go to the parade. In fact I  just put a bunch of parade pictures away a couple weeks ago.  Bishop Well, when history is written what do you want it to say about you?  Haws Well, I think I   ve had a full life. It could end anytime, but I don   t want  it to. There   s more to come. I want to see what   s happening. That   s why  I got a goal of twenty years, and I was talking to someone the other day.  I said   when I was showing them my letter from the superintendent of  schools at Carnegie, I figured out that that would fall, the time would  fall within my goal would be a year earlier so I could go out and  celebrate 100 years from graduation. (Laughs)  Bishop Well this is a different question     Haws People may think I   m crazy but     Bishop Yeah.  26  Haws    in the biblical times they lived up to 800 years. Of course they had a  different calendar.  Bishop You said you want to see what   s going to happen over the next twenty  years. What do you think you will see?  Haws I want it to be a surprise. (Laughter) But I know one thing, with the  growth of the population of the Earth we are going to have to have  something to make up for all the food that has to be grown. We   re going  to be on a chemical diet. People are going to live older, just like now. In  this area we have about four or six that have become 100 years old.  Then I was telling the other day, and you already knew, there   s been  fifteen 100 or older people died since the first of September in  Northeast Oklahoma, from 105 down to 100. Years ago when people  got to be forty years old, they were old people. (Laughs) Now they   re  just kids   Bishop Forty   s the old hundred.  Haws Forty was the old hundred. (Laughter)  Finchum Anything else you want to tell us before we cut it off and shut down?  Haws Really?  Finchum Yes, really.  Haws (Laughs) Well, if I did I   d feel like I was bragging and I don   t want it to  feel that way.  Finchum Well, it wouldn   t. If there   s something you want to say, say it.  Haws (Laughs) No.  Finchum What else is on your bucket list besides going to Tennessee?  Haws Well, having birthdays every year, having big birthdays, and we have a  lot of fun.  Finchum When did you give up driving?  Haws It   s been about ten years. I was still driving in 2001. I woke up that  morning, and I had kind of a pain in my chest. I called my doctor, he  was in Broken Arrow. He said,    Come right out.    We hurried out, he  listened to my heart, he said,    I   m going to call an ambulance and send  you over to Southcrest.    I said,    Don   t do that. Why?    He said,    You   re  27  going to have a heart bypass.    I said,    Well I drove seventeen miles  getting out here, I can still drive five miles over to Southcrest. You  don   t need to call an ambulance.    So I drove over there (laughs),  walked in the emergency room. They were waiting for me with a  wheelchair, took me right up to the   They were in there checking with  me. I never did make the admittance desk. Pretty soon my wife and son  had to go fill out all the paper. We   d been going there at Southcrest. I  was in there four days. People came by that afternoon and visited with  me.  Finchum I think maybe a stubborn streak is the secret to living to 100.  Haws If I can do it, others can do it. They have to have a goal. You know  what mine is, 120.  Finchum One twenty.  Haws Or 119. (Laughs) Have I entertained you enough?  Finchum You   ve been great. I thank you for sharing your stories with us. You   re  great, thank you.  Haws I share it with a lot of people.  ------  -------
