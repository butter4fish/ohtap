Evan Faulkenbury: All right, today is November 22, 2014. My name is Evan Faulkenbury and I&#8217;m interviewing Megan Klutz. Am I saying that right?
Megan Klutz: Yes.
EF: Okay, interviewing Megan Klutz in Burlington, North Carolina. So, the first question I have, Megan, is [to] tell me about your childhood and growing up.
MK: Okay. Well, my childhood was very happy. I&#8217;m from Burlington, have grown up here my whole life, and my childhood was shaped by family and growing up in a small town. I have a very close relationship with my parents, my brother, and my grandparents. So very family-oriented and that&#8217;s very important to me, and that probably shapes a lot of who I am. It&#8217;s a small town but has significantly grown, over the course of the last fifteen years probably, and I think growing up in a small town sometimes you get a different perspective than you would maybe if you were in a larger city because it&#8217;s very closely-knit. And I think that has shaped a lot of my experiences as well.
EF: Can you tell me a bit more specifically about your family members? Can you tell me about your grandparents, to start with?
MK: Yes. My grandparents are in their seventies now and have been here most of their life. They have come from other places as well and started a family here. I think that provides a unique perspective as well because they both grew up in small town atmospheres, and so having a close relationship with them has been very good for me because it&#8217;s helped me stay tied to the past. I learn about things that they experienced as children, things that I wouldn&#8217;t be able to see firsthand but they provide a unique perspective for that. They&#8217;re very simple people. They have worked hard.
EF: Where are they from and what were their professions?
MK: Well, my grandmother is from here.
EF: From Burlington?
MK: Most of her life, yes, and my grandfather is from a small town towards Charlotte called Albemarle.
EF: Oh, yeah.
MK: He did things, like mechanical type things, and he has lots of hobbies, working on cars. My grandmother did various things, I&#8217;m not totally sure of some of the things that she did early on but a lot of administrative type stuff. So I think having that relationship&#8217;s been very good for me because it&#8217;s provided a lot of substance and a lot of information in areas that I ordinarily wouldn&#8217;t have been familiar with.
EF: Are these your paternal or maternal grandparents?
MK: Paternal.
EF: Okay. Do you have a relationship with your maternal grandparents, or growing up?
MK: I did, I did very well, but they passed on when I was very young so I didn&#8217;t get as much time with them.
EF: Sure. Well can you tell me a bit more about your parents then, about where they grew up and their past?
MK: They&#8217;ve grown up in Burlington as well and I have a very close relationship with them. They&#8217;ve shaped my views as well. Mother has done different things growing up and has always worked, and Dad&#8217;s been a business leader in the community. And that shaped my experiences on a lot of things because I had a lot of respect for both of my parents. And I guess early on wanted to aspire to be similar to them because they were, in my opinion, very strong people. I&#8217;ve grown up in a very Christian, very loving, connected family, and that has been a very positive experience for me.
EF: Can you tell me a little bit more maybe specifically what it is about your parents that you&#8217;ve drawn inspiration from?
MK: Sure. I guess the main thing is that, being a small town you know lots of people, and it&#8217;s easy when you go places. People recognize you, recognize your family. If I run into someone that knows either of my parents, they have very positive, very good things to say about both of them, and they&#8217;re both very service-oriented people. They like to do things for others outside of their careers, and I really admired that because I saw positive benefits for them. My father does a lot of things to work with youth, and we&#8217;ve done a lot of things for church, and my mother does a lot of things to give back as well, and I feel like those are important things and positive attributes that I&#8217;ve gained from both of them.
EF: Absolutely. You said your father is a businessman?
MK: Yes.
EF: What&#8217;s his profession and what does he do?
MK: He&#8217;s a CPA, so growing up I&#8217;ve learned a lot about being fiscally responsible and how to make the most out of what you have, and really learning to value and appreciate hard work, and trying to not be wasteful when it comes to that sort of thing, so.
EF: Sure, absolutely. So, I don&#8217;t know if you said this or not, but when were your born, what was your birth date?
MK: I was born in the year 1988.
EF: Okay. In Burlington, right?
MK: Yes.
EF: Gotcha. So you&#8217;ve traced a little bit of your family history, so now I&#8217;m interested about you as a youngster growing up, and you&#8217;ve mentioned before the importance of church. So I wonder if you can go back and trace that lineage. What was growing up in church like and how did it shape you?
MK: Well, I&#8217;ve attended a small church since being born. The family has attended church. [My] mother and father attended church since they were young. Grandparents had church as a part of their life. We&#8217;ve always gone to church as a family. That&#8217;s something that&#8217;s been very important to me, but it&#8217;s a very small church that I grew up in. I guess it shaped me because I really had that close connection with church members and youth group and we did lots of service things growing up, which I think were good experiences for me. It really shaped my faith and my values, as far as my perspective on things as an adult, and really helped me get a good connection and a solid foundation.
EF: Right. What was the name of the church?
MK: Shiloh Presbyterian.
EF: Okay. Is that where you&#8217;re&#8211;? Are you still a part of that community?
MK: Yes, yes.
EF: Okay, so the whole lifetime.
MK: Yes.
EF: Wow. So what&#8217;s the church like? What does it look like and what are some of the beliefs, I guess?
MK: Well, it&#8217;s a smaller church.
EF: Sure.
MK: It&#8217;s an older population so it&#8217;s significantly getting smaller, I guess, throughout the years. I think it&#8217;s been good from [that] aspect. I think it&#8217;s great to be around people that maybe are not in your same age bracket. It&#8217;s good to be around your peers but I think you can learn a lot from folks that are older and wiser than you. I think it provides a different perspective and helps keep you grounded to learn and appreciate for their generation, so I think that significantly played a part in shaping me. It was great from the aspect, because it was a small church I probably got some opportunities as far as Christmas productions and that sort of thing that maybe you wouldn&#8217;t have in larger setting, so it was like a second family and I think that&#8217;s very special and unique.
EF: Right. So, in growing up in a church like that, how did it shape your own personal faith and your own Christian beliefs, if that makes sense?
MK: Yes, yes.
EF: I&#8217;m asking about how, growing up in that setting, internally how did it shape you?
MK: Well, it shaped me from the aspect of faith in God and Christianity and Jesus were very important to me from a young age. I guess it shaped who I was, and it was one of the most important things to me since childhood and shaped who I was into my adulthood. I always thought it was a good way for me to, as I got older, connect to other folks with similar experiences, but also as a tool for others that maybe hadn&#8217;t. It was important to me, from the aspect of I really liked having that close-knit experience with others, people outside of my direct family line. That was very positive for me as far as participating in singing in church or, we would do service-type things, like we would go to the local homeless shelter and help feed families. And I think those are good things to do when you&#8217;re young, and you can see folks maybe in different areas that you wouldn&#8217;t directly see every day. And it helps shape your perspective and helps give you an appreciation for what you do have, and that thing.
EF: Yeah, absolutely. Thank you. Can you talk about your education growing up, I mean, what schools you attended and that impact on you?
MK: Yeah. I attended our local public education system from elementary through high school, and I think that was neat as well because every school was a little different. Schools have changed over the years and it was neat for me because lots of family members had also attended those same schools, so to see maybe what changed since they were there and be able to say I had the same teachers as parents or grandparents.        EF: Same building?        MK: Yeah, same building. It was very interesting.        EF: Right. Wow. That&#8217;s great. I mean high school is always such a formative period in a person&#8217;s life.        MK: Right.        EF: What was your high school experience like?        MK: Very positive. I guess as I got into high school I started to really enjoy school, certain aspects of it. I didn&#8217;t mind going to class and studying, which is not always something that is fun for everyone.        EF: Of course.         MK: I enjoyed that. I had a lot of great friends, many of which I&#8217;d had since childhood, and made additional ones as I got older as well, so that was very neat. I had overall a very positive experience, not a lot I would say I would change, very close-knit friends, some still close with today, others we parted in college.         EF: Right. Do you think your school experience, being in a small town, do you think that that made it even more close-knit in that maybe you see people outside of school more regularly in a small town? Does that make a difference?        MK: I would say so. Yes, probably. I mean I think you certainly can have a close-knit relationship even if you&#8217;re in a larger demographic, but probably because there&#8217;s only a handful of high schools in our whole county, and if you&#8217;re going to school with the same folks maybe since elementary school, you maybe stay in that same direction, but, there&#8217;s always room to expand on that as well.        EF: Right. So after high school what happened next in your life?        MK: Then I went to college.        EF: Okay.        MK: Just right down the road in Greensboro.        EF: At UNC-Greensboro?        MK: Yes.        EF: Okay. And what made you want to go there?        MK: Well, for one thing because I am so close to my family and I didn&#8217;t want to get very far away, which is probably the opposite of what a lot of young people want. I really wanted to stay close to my family. That was very important to me.         EF: Sure. Then what did you study at Greensboro?        MK: They had a program called Consumer Apparel and Retail Studies. I was very interested in fashion and liked to draw and had been very creative as a child, and it was a good way for me to be involved in that but also stay close to this area.        EF: Right. What was UNC-Greensboro like? How was that experience overall?        MK: Overall very good. At first, a lot of my classmates and friends had gone to other universities, so it was overwhelming, but I had a really good roommate who was from the area and we were very close and very similar, so that helped me to verge into that. Then as I attended I made more and more friends, some outside of my major, some in my major, and that helped make my experience a little bit more positive because I had gotten to know more folks and made more connections, so that definitely helped.        EF: Right. Going from a small town to, I guess, a big university setting, how did you&#8211;? Were you involved in any clubs or groups, things like that?        MK: Yes, I was in a sorority and then I was in, the first year, an organization within my major, and we did fashion shows and that sort of thing. So that was neat, and met some folks with similar interest.        EF: Right. So of course now you&#8217;re the chair, I think of the Republican Women in Alamance County, but I&#8217;m interested in knowing&#8211;. College is oftentimes a place where people are first active, not always, but did you get involved in any political activism while at college?        MK: Well, we had a College Republicans organization, and I was not as active then as I am now but still made those connections and formed relationships with some of those folks. So it&#8217;s probably more on a larger scale now than it was at that time but I did form some relationships then, yes.        EF: And I guess this must have been George W. Bush&#8217;s presidency?        MK: Sort of, and then a few years after that as well.        EF: Okay. So how did maybe the national political scene play into what your chapter was doing at UNC-Greensboro?        MK: Well, I got involved in that later in the game. I think a lot of the things that they were doing at that time was offering another perspective, another opinion maybe, more of a way for people to choose and see other options. A lot of the people involved in the group had similar viewpoints on things, but differing as well, and wanted to get involved.         EF: Right. So what happened after you graduated from college?        MK: Well after I graduated from college I did several internships in different design sectors, and then moved back home, and working, and realizing that I had that interest. And so [I] started coming to local Republican party meetings just to have something that I was interested in and make connections because I had moved back here, and wanted to get out in the community and make friends with folks since a lot of my friends maybe were in the places where they&#8217;d gone to college and hadn&#8217;t all come back to this area.        EF: Right. So you did a few internships. Where were these internships, after college? Were they in the area?        MK: Yes, they were.        EF: Okay. So you moved back to Burlington after college then?        MK: Yes.        EF: Okay. So I&#8217;m interested in how more specifically you learned about the National Federation of Republican Women and how you specifically got involved.        MK: Well, I had attended a Republican Party meeting a few years back, just over a summer, and had met a few folks and they mentioned that there was a group, Alamance Republican Women, and so that was in the back of my mind for a few years. When I moved back here I thought, &#8220;I&#8217;m kind of interested in this and this would be a good way for me to meet other ladies and make connections with people that have similar interests to me.&#8221; So I had gotten an email about a Republican Party meeting and attended, and then I found out there was an Alamance Republican Women&#8217;s meeting the following week. So I went to that and met a lot of great ladies that were passionate about these things and had similar interests, and they were very nice, very sweet, caring ladies, and I really enjoyed interacting with them and it perpetuated. I kept attending more and more meetings and getting more involved and really enjoyed meeting people that were as interested in these things as I was, so it was almost like a second family for me, and I really made a lot of connections and really enjoyed it.        EF: Very close-knit, it must be.        MK: Yes.        EF: So you&#8217;re the chair and I&#8217;m curious, how did you get into a position of leadership so early?        MK: Well, after attending for about a year several members had already had leadership positions and were moving on to other things, and I really had gotten involved and had gone to every meeting and had been the campaign chair and really enjoyed that.        EF: For which campaign?        MK: It was just a general.        EF: Oh, I see.        MK: Keeping up to date with local leaders and keeping our club up to date on what&#8217;s going on. So I had really enjoyed that and a lot of the ladies in our group thought that I would be a great leader because they were looking to engage more youth and I was very interested and passionate about it. So they asked me if I would be willing to do this, so I said, &#8220;Sure, this would be a great learning opportunity for me.&#8221; So I decided to do it.         EF: Okay. And how&#8217;s the experience been since you took it over?        MK: Very good, very good. This year was a campaign year, 2014, so I think I learned a lot and got a lot of experiences that you wouldn&#8217;t get every year. So I&#8217;ve met a lot of great people I think who share my similar values and interest and it&#8217;s been very positive.        EF: So I&#8217;d really like to know more about why you&#8217;ve been drawn to the Republican Party and why you&#8217;ve been drawn to conservatism. Can you talk about some of those issues that are most important to you and what&#8217;s drawn you in that direction?        MK: Sure. I have, I guess, been conservative since childhood, my family is very conservative, so it&#8217;s something that&#8217;s always been in the back of my mind. And as I emerged as an adult I found that I had different maybe opinions or ideas on things than even some of my friends, and that&#8217;s what perpetuated me into being as interested and involved in this. I wanted to make a difference. I wanted to, in a positive way, maybe help make a connection in the community because I know that I&#8217;m very passionate in what I believe but I very much care about people and our local community and state and national. And I felt like it would be better for me to get involved and try to make a difference than to sit back and not do anything about it.         EF: So, with conservatism, are you motivated more by social issues or economic issues or a mixture, or maybe specific ones?        MK: Probably a mixture. I guess I&#8217;m very aware of financial issues and I&#8217;m very much a problem solver. If I see that there&#8217;s a need I like to try to help, and I guess for me I&#8217;m very motivated and driven by a lot of different things. I appreciate folks with all different opinions and viewpoints and I really try to help bridge that gap so that maybe we can get real results and that type thing.        EF: I&#8217;d also like to ask about I guess maybe more specific with the recent Tillis campaign &#8211; with the Thom Tillis campaign, let me specify. What was your role in leading the Alamance Republican Women in the campaign, and was it different from your regular role as chair during a campaign year? What was your involvement?        MK: Well, actually every county, or most counties, had a specific person for the Tillis campaign that had started back in the primary, so they were the main focus on that. We as a club didn&#8217;t get involved with any candidates until after all the primaries. We try to stay neutral until that point.         EF: I see.        MK: But, after voters had selected their choices, we provided a support system and worked with local campaigns and committees. And specifically with Tillis we had a member of our group who had followed that from the start, and she would set up events to promote his election, and we would work with her to help get the news out there and provide opportunities to speak.        EF: Okay. What sort of tactics did you use to promote, as well as local candidates, too?        MK: Right. We had a breakfast that he came and he spoke, and we had a location which we were able to provide, and this member actually set a lot of that up but we were more of a resource. We would hold events. We had a forum back during the primary where we offered everyone who was a candidate the chance to come and speak, and closer to the November election as well we would give people opportunities at our club meetings. We would help promote fundraisers and events that they were having. We were more of a resource, I guess, for everyone in general.        EF: Right. That makes sense. Part of these interviews that I&#8217;m doing with conservative women and activists, I&#8217;m trying to gauge individual opinions on feminism. So I wonder if you can give me your thoughts, and I know that&#8217;s a big word and it means many things to many different people, but I&#8217;m wondering what it means specifically to you.        MK: Well, that&#8217;s something that I think has emerged over the years. I think that a lot of the feminism that we hear about in today&#8217;s time is not the same feminism that was necessarily meant maybe in the early 1900s and the [19]20s. I think some of the original feminists maybe had different approaches and ways of doing things than maybe some of the females would use today that would describe themselves as feminists. I think &#8220;feminist&#8221; is a broad term. I think it sometimes has negative connotations associated with it in today&#8217;s society. I think certain women use that to make a statement and try to use it as a way to get gender equality, but I think a lot of the original feminists wanted just to have a chance and to have an option. Something that was very interesting to me is when I go through history I look at the fact that the first female elected to Congress was Republican and that was very inspiring to me. I think that sometimes words and meanings get changed over time, and so it&#8217;s a very broad term.         EF: Well, that&#8217;s about the end of my questions. I wonder if there&#8217;s anything else that I haven&#8217;t asked that you think might be important to share, whether stories or anything else to have a chance to talk about.        MK: Sure. I think a lot of experiences, whether it be childhood or different factors in adulthood, shape people in a lot of different ways, and I really think for me specifically growing up with such a close-knit family and working, even if it was a part-time job since high school, really, instilled the values of independence and wanting to do the best that I could. I think different experiences for people in general and different exposures, I think that often shapes people&#8217;s views on things.        EF: Right, specifically to your own, I guess, with such a close-knit family.        MK: Yes.        EF: Well, great. Well, as long as there&#8217;s nothing else, I guess I&#8217;ll go ahead and turn it off.        MK: Thank you.        EF: Thank you.
