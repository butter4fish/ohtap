 Finchum Today is November the 18, 2015. My name is Tanya Finchum. I   m with Oklahoma State University, and today I am in Leedey, Oklahoma, to speak with Dr. Jamie Gore. This is part of our Cowboys in Every County. Thank you for having me today. Let   s start with having you tell us when and where you were born.  Gore Nineteen seventy-eight, Elk City, Oklahoma.  Finchum In a hospital or at home?  Gore Hospital.  Finchum What did your parents do for a living?  Gore My dad was a dairy farmer, and my mom, the bank teller.  Finchum In where?  Gore Leedey, yes, in Leedey, Oklahoma.  Finchum They traveled from Leedey to Elk City for your birth?  Gore Yes.  Finchum Closest hospital or     Gore Yes. That   s the closest.  Finchum About how far is that from here?  Gore It   s thirty-four miles.  Finchum Not too bad. Do you have brothers and sisters?5  Gore I do. I have an older brother and an older sister.  Finchum Oh, you   re the baby.  Gore I   m the baby. (Laughter)  Finchum Did you have chores on the dairy farm?  Gore Yes. We had baby calves that we fed by the bottle and bucket and helped milk, clean the barn, mow, all that stuff.  Finchum Have to do those things before school?  Gore I did not usually. After school was usually my chore time.  Finchum Were you in FFA or 4-H when you were in     Gore 4-H, yeah.  Finchum Where   d you go to elementary school?  Gore Leedey. We have one K through twelve. It   s pre-K through twelve now but all in the same building. We went to school that whole time in Leedey.  Finchum Was it close enough to walk, or did you ride a bus?  Gore I rode a bus. We live about a mile out of town, but usually rode the bus. I did live in town some in junior high and high school. Got dropped off by my mom or rode my bike.  Finchum Have a favorite subject?  Gore Probably science was my favorite.  Finchum Were you in the band or play sports?  Gore Sports, yes. Played softball and basketball.  Finchum What position, basketball?  Gore I was guard. We had six-on-six until my senior year, and then we went five-on-five and played several positions then.  Finchum Had to juggle all of that classwork and sports, plus the farm? 6  Gore Yes.  Finchum Was the farm in your family before your parents?  Gore My grandpa actually started it, yeah.  Finchum Has it been in the family a 100     Gore No, he started it back in the    60s, I believe.  Finchum Not quite in the centennial farm range yet then. I noticed there   s several of those in Dewey County.  Gore Yeah, yeah. The dairy part, they had land before that, but the dairy part, he started back then.  Finchum Regulations have played a   have changed the way dairy   s been doing.  Gore Yeah, yeah. Well, it was hard also to find help when my grandpa got older and couldn   t help. My dad was doing it all on his own when I was in college and med school. He actually quit milking in 2004 when I graduated from med school     Finchum ...and turned it over to you all?  Gore He just sold out the dairy part. We still have the land and cattle but not the dairy.  Finchum How large was his herd?  Gore Usually around a 100, the average.  Finchum Are you a milk drinker?  Gore Yes, yes. (Laughter)  Finchum Did they make their own cream and cottage cheese and ice cream and all that?  Gore No, not in my time, anyway. We bought that, but we did drink milk from the tank, from the cows that we milked.  Finchum That   s good, I would think.  Gore It was good, yeah. When he quit milking, we had to start buying milk. (Laughs) It was a little hard to get used to. 7  Finchum Maybe taste a little different?  Gore Yeah, yeah.  Finchum I would imagine that there   s certain smells and sounds and things that you would miss from having the animals around, too.  Gore I don   t know about miss. (Laughter) Well, it smells better around there now since we don   t have all the cows right there by the house, but yeah, we still have cattle. We still have     Finchum    have some of that.  Gore Yeah.  Finchum The drought was hard out here for a few years on you all. It looked pretty green coming in today.  Gore Yeah, it looks nice now. We   ve had pretty good rain this year. The wheat crops look pretty good right now, but if it   ll keep raining.  Finchum There was some other crop. I couldn   t tell what, if it   s soybeans or what. It had the bigger leaves.  Gore Yeah, I   m not sure what, there   s been some newer     Finchum Canola, maybe?  Gore    crops around. They   ve done some of the canola also, but it   s not   .  Finchum Then I just saw tank farms, too. Thought of the oil out in this area.  Gore Yes, yeah. Yeah, the oil fields have been big out here. The slowdowns really hurt the economy out here with layoffs.  Finchum The wind towers, I was surprised at how many. Dewey County must have, I don   t know, about a 1000 maybe or even more. (Laughs)  Gore Yeah, there   s a lot. Those have went up in the last few years, too.  Finchum I thought maybe that   s played into the new county courthouse.  Gore Possibly, yeah.  Finchum The infrastructure improvement would have   I don   t know, just guessing.8  Gore I   m not sure. Yeah, I   m not sure right now.  Finchum When did you graduate from high school?  Gore Nineteen ninety-six.  Finchum Then where did you go?  Gore I went to Southwestern  Oklahoma State University  in Weatherford  Oklahoma  for undergraduate.  Finchum Majoring in what?  Gore Biology, minor in chemistry. Got my bachelor   s of science from there 2000 and started med school that fall at OSU.  Finchum You always wanted to be in the medical field?  Gore Not really. I always liked the science area. In high school, we had to do a job shadow for one of our classes, and my sister worked for an eye place in Elk City. It was Britton Vision Associates. It was a branch of them, and they had optometry and an ophthalmologist there. I went and shadowed the ophthalmologist for half a day and watched some eye surgeries and then shadowed the optometrist the second half of the day. He was not a general optometrist. He specialized more in eye disease. It was pretty interesting. I decided after that I   d go   I   d start college majoring in optometry, pre-optometry. It was a biology major still, but my first year, getting into more classes, I decided I didn   t want just to do eyes and ended up changing to pre-med.  Finchum You went that path instead of veterinarian?  Gore (Laughs) Yeah, yeah. I like animals, but no. Didn   t think I wanted to do that part.  Finchum Then once you finished that and you went to, I   m assuming you applied other places, or did you just always want to go through OSU to get in?  Gore I did apply to OU also. During the first application process, I hadn   t completed all of my prerequisite classes. When I took the MCAT  Medical College Admission Test , I was just taking Physics I and Organic Chemistry I. I still had the Organic Chemistry II and Physics II to take. I just thought, well, I   ll just go through the process and went and did tours of the schools and just applied to those two and really liked the OSU, how the school was set up with smaller class size. It just had a more   feel of being at home at the school. It fit with my personality and my character, from coming from a 9  small town, small school, and being raised in a rural area. Just fit better with me, and I got accepted that year. Started that fall.  Finchum I guess distance-wise it   s not that much difference between the two, between Tulsa and   .  Gore Tulsa   s a little bit farther, but yeah.  Finchum You had to move, and then   .  Gore Probably ninety miles farther, I guess. Yeah, we moved up to Tulsa and was there the four years for med school.  Finchum Do you like city life a little bit?  Gore No. No, not really. I like to shop a little bit, not enough to live there. (Laughter)  Finchum When you say    we,    were you married at that time?  Gore Yes. My husband and I got married after my first year of college in    97. We dated in high school.  Finchum High school sweetheart.  Gore Yes.  Finchum Then he   s from here?  Gore Yeah, he   s from Taloga  Oklahoma  originally, and he graduated from Leedey and moved here and played baseball his senior year. Graduated from Leedey, but he grew up at Taloga.  Finchum Well, I   ve not been on the campus, the OSU-Tulsa med school campus. I don   t know that much about it. Is it a small campus, or is it one building or what?  Gore It was one building at that time. I know they   ve made some changes to the campus since I graduated, and I haven   t actually been back on campus in a few years. I haven   t seen all the new changes. We had my eleven-year class reunion a couple weeks ago, and I missed it. My daughter had a ballgame. I didn   t get to go, but I know they have made some changes to the building. It was one building then and had, they   d added on a new part, new auditoriums that we, at that time, didn   t have, but it was all in one building.  Finchum How many were in your class? 10  Gore We started out around eighty-eight. That   s what they accepted in each class was around. I   m not exactly sure how many we ended up graduating with.  Finchum That was how long of a program, six years?  Gore Four years.  Finchum That would put you graduating in     Gore    Two thousand four, yeah.  Finchum During that time, did you learn to follow the cowboys?  Gore Yeah. I was always an Oklahoma State fan. My dad went to Oklahoma State for a while. He didn   t graduate from there. He was always die-hard OSU when we were growing up. He was a big sports fan. We had football and basketball and wrestling and everything. We were always up on that with him. It wasn   t hard to   I was always an O-State fan.  Finchum You were a Poke?  Gore Yeah. (Laughter)  Finchum Was he majoring in ag since he was from farm background?  Gore Yeah, yeah, yeah. I think he attended there one year, but he came back and took over the dairy and started helping my grandpa with it.  Finchum Did he have siblings, your father?  Gore Yes. He had an older and a younger brother. My Uncle Ed lives at Camargo  Oklahoma , which is just eleven miles north of here, and his younger brother passed away from pancreatic cancer in, several years now.  Finchum Did he stay in the area, too?  Gore He lived in Elk City, yeah.  Finchum What is it about this area that keeps you all here?  Gore I don   t know. Weatherford   s just an hour from here. Then Tulsa, and we lived in Durant  Oklahoma  for three years for residency and couldn   t wait to get back out here. There   s just the people, and especially in Leedey, these little communities like this, they   re just, we   re all supported by the community. The people here are just not like people that you would meet, 11  that we   ve met in other places. We   ve met some really good people along the way, but just overall, the sense of community here is   .  Finchum Families here have been here a long time, generation after generation?  Gore Yeah, most of them. We have new families that have moved in, but for the most part, they   re   long history with families here.  Finchum What did you do in Durant?  Gore I did my family medicine residency. It   s rural medicine, rural family medicine residency through OSU, and I did that post-graduate training there for three years.  Finchum Did you have to do house calls, or did they come to you?  Gore No, we did, we had a clinic. Worked in the hospital, and then had clinic by that resident clinic by the hospital there.  Finchum What were some of the main things you saw? Was it primarily broken bones or heart attacks or what?  Gore All of those. We had general family medicine in clinic. We had a lot of just managing chronic illnesses, diabetes and saw a lot of hepatitis and heart, obviously, diabetes and heart problems, but in the hospital, ER, we saw     Finchum    a little bit of everything, I   d say.  Gore    a wide range of things, yeah.  Finchum Was obesity an issue, since diabetes was?  Gore Yeah, yeah, yeah. All over the state, that   s pretty much a big issue.  Finchum Well, you see commercials that there   s a shortage for rural healthcare. Is that part of the reason you went into it or not?  Gore There was a shortage there, but I didn   t really   I chose family medicine because when I was in my second or my last two years of med school, we do rotations through the different specialties, and we have core that we have to go through, which is surgery and OB and primary care. We have several family medicine   OSU was, at that time, more geared towards putting out primary care physicians, and every rotation I did, I liked. I decided on family medicine because of that. Not a big surgery fan, as far as long surgeries. I do a lot of minor procedures in the office with skin lesion removal and things like that, but long surgeries, I   m not good with. I decided 12  away from that area, but everything else, I liked. That   s how I chose family medicine, and when I was looking at residencies, we knew we wanted to come back out here to live. That rural medicine residency really appealed to me because it was similar setting to what I would be in out here with being a couple hours away from metropolitan, large hospitals and being able to take care of patients here and coordinate care with specialists far away. That   s why I chose that, that residency.  Finchum Well, working out of this office, do you do home visits, home call, house calls?  Gore I have done a few. Some of the elderly patients that I   ve taken care of, I grew up going to church with since I grew up in this community. There   s a ninety-eight-year-old that if she needs something, I go to her house if they can   t bring her to me. I have done some.  Finchum She may still see you as the little two-year-old.  Gore Yes, yes. (Laughter) The church I grew up in, my grandparents and her were about the same age. They were good friends, and I just saw her the other day. She mentioned my grandma and a lot of the people her age from our church that have passed on because they   re all gone. She   s pretty much the only one left that age.  Finchum Give her special treatment. (Laughs)  Gore Yes, yes.  Finchum What are some of the biggest challenges for doing rural healthcare?  Gore One would be, from just growing up here, everybody knows me. They know where I live, and they have my phone number. If they don   t have mine, they have my husband   s. There   s not a lot of peace, as far as me just being able to step back and not be a doctor. If I go to church, if I go to ballgames, my kids    school functions, if I go in the  Timms  Quick Stop to get a drink, they   re,    Oh, let me ask you about this.    A lot of them have become more sensitive about that, as far as being able to have my time to just be me and not the doctor me, but that   s one big challenge. It   s a tradeoff. On the other hand, if I need something, I   ve got a whole community to pick my kids up from school if I need it. Anything I need, they   re   I have that.  Other challenges would be just the access to specialists because I am, in family medicine, if I have a patient with end-stage liver disease and I don   t have a liver specialist close, I   m not one, and that   s the importance of coordinating that care, being able to communicate with the specialist. We just don   t have a lot of those out here close to be able to send them to.13  Finchum How do you keep up with who   s the specialist and who   s not, Internet or at a conference?  Gore Well, the hospital I work with now at Woodward  Oklahoma , we   re a group of hospitals, AllianceHealth Oklahoma. They   ve just recently changed the name to make us all the same name. We have good access now through Deaconess  Hospital , as far as having a lot of specialists and then Midwest City Hospital. A lot of them, I went to school with, medical school with. I have a good outreach there, as far as getting ahold of specialists that I know personally, and then some, I   ve just used based on referrals from other physicians. I   ve developed relationships there.  Finchum Do you have to handle much of the insurance part?  Gore Not a lot. I mean, I do have to be sensitive to that because if I need something done, a test ordered, I have to be sensitive to their deductibles and their   if there   s prior authorizations that we   re going to have to have done and how quickly we can get those tests done because of the insurance. I do have to deal with that, but I don   t have to work denials or anything like that. Our office staff does that.  Finchum How many days do you work here in Leedey?  Gore I   m here one day a week.  Finchum The other time you   re in     Gore    Woodward.  Finchum Do you see much difference in your clientele between the two?  Gore Not really. They   re pretty similar. I was in Elk City for several years and practiced there before I moved up to Woodward, and I still have a lot of, several Elk City patients that come here on Thursdays to see me. They   re all pretty similar patients. I mean, here, there   s a little bit more personal connection, I guess, to the patients because I   ve known most of them for a long time, but now that I   ve been in Woodward a year and a half, I   ve gotten to know a lot of my patients pretty closely up there.  Finchum Do you see many farming accidents?  Gore Few. I haven   t had any really serious ones since I   ve been here. Several falling off tractors, chainsaws to the leg, things like that, lacerations and broken bones, but I haven   t had any, thankfully, any serious farming accidents here.14  Finchum You don   t have any issues with blood then. (Laughs)  Gore No. Blood   s fine.  Finchum I   m not. (Laughter)  Gore Some people will do that, but no, I   m good with blood. It doesn   t bother me.  Finchum Do you envision just spending, staying here for the rest of your working career, between the two?  Gore Yeah. There   s some difficulties with driving. I   m on the road an hour-and-a half every day driving to and from work, and I   ve got three kids at home here. They go to school, and they   re in all activities. My oldest one   s, she   s almost eleven. She   s in the fifth grade. She   s got a lot of activities. My little younger two are kindergarten and pre-K. They   re not quite as busy yet, but trying to make it to all the activities. Leedey plays a team south of here, Sentinel  Oklahoma  and Thomas  Oklahoma . If they play there, I can   t always because the elementary play early. I can   t always make it to those games, but you have that with any job, though. I just do what I can.  Finchum Have a little bit of flexibility to where you have appointments or not, I guess, a little bit.  Gore Little bit, yeah.  Finchum What prompted your switch from Elk City to Woodward, anything in particular?  Gore I   d been in private practice, and that was getting really financially hard with all the changes with Medicare and insurance and reimbursement and the increasing costs. I didn   t go into medicine to deal with that. I went into medicine to care for patients. It just got to where I didn   t like what I was doing. I changed to   from private practice to working for the hospital at Elk City as an employed physician, and I liked it there. I didn   t ever think I   d leave there, but I had the   my husband was on the volunteer fire department here in Leedey. When the Woodward tornado went through, we were sending in a firetruck for rescue and an ambulance. My uncle was the Woodward County sheriff at the time, my mom   s brother, and I called him just to see if they needed help at the hospital. I don   t know how many injuries they had. It was a pretty bad, big tornado. He called them, and they said,    Yes, tell her to come help.    I went up there, and I was there a few hours. Just sewed up some minor lacerations and things like that. It was crazy there. I mean, there were so many patients in and out, and I had contact with a couple of the physicians that are in Woodward when I was there just briefly. Then I left. I thought they didn   t even know I was there 15  because it was so crazy, but I think it was the year after, getting close to the year anniversary of the tornado that they were working on an anniversary celebration to recognize the people that came and helped.  My name came up, and the CEO at the hospital there, Dave Wallace, he thought, he was like,    Jamie Gore was here?    and they said,    Yeah, she   s a doctor in Elk City, I think.    He   s like,    I know her.    He was the COO  chief operating officer  at Durant when I was a resident there, and I didn   t know he was in Woodward. He made contact with me and wanted me to come to their celebration, and I couldn   t go at the time they had it. He called me again, and then I had a friend that was a nurse there. I had talked to her a little bit about it. I just felt like I needed a change, and the way Dave contacted me, he actually contacted me three separate times. The times that he had contacted me, I just really, I just felt like God was really leading me there. It was a big change, and it was hard. It was a lot harder than I thought it was going to be leaving my patients in Elk City. I had patients come in yelling at me because I was leaving, and some were crying. (Laughs) Then others, it was no big deal. (Laughs) Some that followed me but I wasn   t expecting how hard it was going to be to move. In the middle of that, I   m like,    Why am I doing this? This is crazy.    I just still, the whole time, I just felt God   s lead to take me there, and I was able to stay here and not move my family. Not a great explanation for it other than that   s where God led me.  Finchum Things seemed to fall into, or the stars were aligned, as they say.  Gore Yeah, yeah, and it   s been a good move. I like it there, and the administration staff is great. They took that hospital over about three years ago, I think. CHS  Community Health Systems  bought that hospital out and came in, took it over, and they really made some good changes in the hospital in three years. It was a good move.  Finchum Did the COO have any connections to OSU if he was in Durant? Did he come through OSU?  Gore No, he was from another state. The company that owned Durant Hospital is the same company that bought out Woodward. They had moved him in, into Durant, for administration there and then moved him to Woodward.  Finchum Well, do you have a favorite patient? Don   t have to say the name, but a favorite story that goes along with it?  Gore I have a lot of favorite patients. (Laughter)  Finchum Well,    favorite    may not be the right word, interesting or success story or something?16  Gore Yeah, I have, gosh, there   s so many. I have a patient, actually two patients right now, but one of them, he   s still struggling a lot. Learned about this disease in med school called sarcoidosis, and they   re like,    Oh, this is normally in African-American females.    You look for these things on the bloodwork, and they have, one of the bigger things is enlarged lymph nodes in the chest. They can have an arthritis syndrome with it, and I had a patient from, that I   ve known a long time come in with some lymph nodes in her chest. I was worried she had lymphoma, and we were really worried about that. We sent her for biopsy. It was sarcoidosis, but she   s a white female. (Laughs) I   m like,    I don   t know if this is weird,    but yeah. She   s on medications for that, but I have now a white male who   s in his early thirties. He   s still having a lot of problems with his, but he   s doing better. Those are probably interesting because they were like,    Oh, you   ll never see this. You probably won   t ever see this, but just remember this. It   s African-American females.    I have one African-American female with it, but just reminds you of that.  Finchum Not too sure what can happen.  Gore The disease does not always follow what they say it will follow, and then one of my good friends has a son with Hirschsprung   s, was born with Hirschsprung   s. I took care of him in the hospital, and he had a lot of problems in the first few weeks. Then he was diagnosed and had surgery, a colostomy, and then had that reversal. They   ve been through a lot with him, but he   s doing a lot better now. He   s three. He   s been a fun one to watch. He still has problems from it, but he   s a fun patient. He hates me, though.  Finchum For giving him shots or something? (Laughs)  Gore Yeah. He   s had a lot of surgeries and needle exposure in his three years that he   s been here, but he sees me and just starts screaming. (Laughs) I   m not his favorite person.  Finchum Well, hopefully he   ll grow out of that one.  Gore Yeah. (Laughter)  Finchum You get attached regardless, I guess.  Gore Yeah. I   ve had a lot of kids that   my cousin   s little girl has juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. She   s in remission now, and I took care of her after I moved out here. Then I don   t know. There   s just a lot of kids that I   ve taken care of. I   ll probably end   I enjoy that a lot there, just watching the kids through their growth and changes and the ones that have chronic diseases like that that are doing well. They have great specialists that they see, but it   s just fun watching that.17  Finchum You see all ages. You probably don   t deliver babies, but then     Gore I don   t deliver babies.  Finchum    in the aftermath, you see them.  Gore Yeah, I see newborns to 100-year-olds. I have some nursing home patients, and I started that when I was in Elk City taking care of a nursing home. I enjoy that, too.  Finchum I would imagine the hardest part would be the death, of losing the battle.  Gore Yeah, it   s something they don   t prepare you well enough for. We have lectures on death in med school. We had a few lectures on end-of-life care and DNR  Do not resuscitate  and advanced directives and how to talk to the patients, but just lecturing on it isn   t, it   s not a great preparation for that. In med school, rotations have a good exposure to telling patients that they were dying or dealing with families with dying patients, but it   s something I   ve learned to deal with. Probably a lot harder being from this community and dealing with people that I   ve known my whole life and in other families. Helping them die is not something I was prepared to do, but I   ve had to do that. Then one of them was my grandpa.  He developed a pulmonary embolism and ended up in the ICU. He had some, a lot of arthritis and neurologic issues anyway. Couldn   t walk after being in the ICU for several days and had to go to the nursing home, and he was in the nursing home that I was medical director at. I go for my rounds, and one day, they told me,    We need you to go talk to your grandpa because he   s packing his bags. He said he   s going home.    I had to go in there and talk to my grandpa and tell him why he couldn   t go home. That was not easy. I wasn   t his doctor, but he ended up getting worse and ended up on hospice. I was up there every day making sure he had his pain medicine and he wasn   t hurting. It was very tiring and emotionally hard to watch him, but that   s helped me with family members and patients that I take care of, just experiencing that myself. It   s definitely hard.  Finchum Well, after you   ve dealt with something like that, how do you recover? I mean, what do you do to rejuvenate, not with just that situation, but again with others?  Gore I really don   t even know how I made it through that. That was a hard year.  Finchum While you were helping him   .  Gore I had a retinal detachment and had had surgery on my eye and gone through the stress of that and was recovering from that when he got sick. My son 18  was just a year old, and my daughter was five. We had just moved up here not long before that from Elk City, and I was working full time. I really don   t even   God   s what got me through that, and just prayer and knowing that I wasn   t doing it myself because there   s no way I could have made it through that on my own. It was a tough year, and then I got pregnant with my daughter right after his funeral. It was not planned. That was another stressor that came when I was like,    What is going on?    but she   s been amazing.  Finchum You must be pretty good at juggling and managing and time management and all of that.  Gore I don   t feel I   m good at it, but     Finchum    things get done.  Gore    you just, one day at a time. We live on the farm I grew up on, my parents across the driveway from us. My mom and dad are a big help with the kids, and my husband   s here a lot. He works here. He has to be out of town some, but he   s usually around. They do a lot, especially my mom and dad, helping out with getting the kids where they need to be.  Finchum Mealtime?  Gore Yeah, yeah. Mom usually has supper cooked when I get home at night. That helps a lot.  Finchum That helps a lot, yes. (Laughter) When you do have time for leisure, what do you do?  Gore There   s not a lot of time for that, but   .  Finchum Read a book?  Gore No, I do not read. (Laughter) I read so much. I stare at the computer all week. I don   t want to do any of that.  Finchum That   s true.  Gore We have church activities through the week, and then we like to shoot guns. That   s a new thing in the last few years. I never shot a gun when I was a kid.  Finchum Just at targets move or     Gore Yeah, go out and shoot targets and blow things up   no, not really. (Laughter) It   s a good stress reliever shooting, even a target. It   s fun, and 19  then we have Razors. We used to have four-wheelers, but we mostly have Razors now. We go out and ride those.  Finchum What   s a Razor? I   m not sure. One of the four-wheel     Gore Yeah, it   s a   .  Finchum Like a Kubota?  Gore Sort of, but they   re faster.  Finchum Oh. (Laughter)  Gore We have a four-wheeler with Razors. The last couple of years, we went to Colorado on vacation and took those, and we rode the mountains.  Finchum That would be fun.  Gore That   s fun, but they   re fun to ride around here.  Finchum Were they for the snow?  Gore Anything.  Finchum Anything?  Gore Yeah, snow, mud, dry dirt, which we   ve had a lot of out here. (Laughs) We go out in the field and jump terraces with them. Yeah, they   re fun.  Finchum How big is the farm? How many acres is the     Gore I   m not even sure. We have a half-section, and then we rent, my husband and I rent some school land that   s attached to that.  Finchum Is a half-section 160, or is that a quarter? I don   t know. I should know that because, but I don   t.  Gore I should know that, too. I don   t have a lot of close hand in all the farming.  Finchum The terracing, I know they did that during the WPA  Works Project Administration  era down, back in the    40s and    50s through there. You still have those, and you hop them.  Gore Yeah, they   re fun to jump. (Laughs)  Finchum I bet that   d be pretty neat in the snow to do that.20  Gore Yeah. I haven   t done that in the snow yet with a Razor.  Finchum No accidents doing that, I   m assuming?  Gore Not yet. They do have seatbelts and helmets. The kids wear helmets.  Finchum Do you have horses?  Gore We have horses. My daughter, oldest daughter, really likes riding horses, but we don   t have a lot of time to do that often. We do that some.  Finchum Is she in 4-H, or maybe she   s too young to do anything.  Gore She is in 4-H, yes. Yeah, she has show pigs, shows pigs. She   s done that for a couple years now. We do have that. Horses, donkeys, that   s about all, other than the cattle.  Finchum I saw a sign coming in for mules. It was more into Dewey County. It wasn   t here, but the mule track or something. Don   t see a great deal of those around Stillwater. (Laughter)  Gore No, I bet not. Summer, we like to go to the lake, too. We have a boat.  Finchum Which one?  Gore We normally go to Foss, but it had been so dry. It   s finally full again. We went to Texoma  Oklahoma  a couple times since we   .  Finchum Not Canton?  Gore Canton   s been dry, too. It   s better now since the rain we got this spring, but yeah, we   ve been to Canton, too.  Finchum They fish, or just boating or swimming or both?  Gore Both, yeah. We have wave runners and a boat. Kids like to play on the water, and then we fish some, too. Haven   t done a lot of that in the last two or three years, either, with the   when Foss was full, we used to go every weekend. This summer, we didn   t get to do that as much, even though it was filled back up with the rain, but we just had a lot of changes going on, a lot of stuff going on this summer. We didn   t get to go up much.  Finchum The hills here are the ones that they come and do rattlesnake hunts in, is that right, the Gibson hills?21  Gore There are some, yeah. Further south of here is, they have the big rattlesnake hunts, and then there is a place east of here that does them.  Finchum Okeene  Oklahoma , I saw the sign coming through, Okeene. Your husband doesn   t do that?  Gore No. He is not a snake person. He would drive into oncoming traffic to try to kill a snake and has done that before. He   s deathly afraid of snakes. (Laughter) No, he would not be hunting any. (Laughter) He is not like this.  Finchum Do you ever, as a family, go to anything at OSU, like basketball, football, whatever?  Gore We have a couple times. It   s been a few years since we   ve been to a football game, and then we went to a basketball game a couple years ago. We don   t get to go very often.  Finchum Follow them on, keep up with them or, somehow?  Gore Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. I have my ESPN app and keep track of the scores if I   m not by a TV.  Finchum Have anything orange in your closet?  Gore A lot, yes, a lot of orange. All my kids are OSU fans, but we just painted my daughter   s room pink, the little one, the four-year-old. She was in there telling me how much she loved the pink, and she said,    It   s not for OSU, but it   s pink. I like pink.    She likes her OSU stuff, too.  Finchum You have three children, all three girls?  Gore No, one boy. Middle one   s a boy.  Finchum Eleven     Gore    six, and four.  Finchum That   s a houseful.  Gore Yes, a lot of fighting. (Laughs)  Finchum Did you have any of them while you were in, at OSU-Tulsa?  Gore No. I had the oldest one when I was an intern in Durant. She was the first one.22  Finchum Well, she may want to go to there then if she was born in Durant.  Gore No, she wants to go to OSU. (Laughter) She   s already told me that. She doesn   t know what she wants to do yet, but she loves animals. She   s talked about being a vet, but I don   t know. She does not want to be a doctor. She makes that really clear. (Laughs)  Finchum Of the three of you, and you were the only one that went into medicine, something to do with medicine?  Gore Yeah, yeah. My brother works for an oil field company here, and my sister, she did work as an ophthalmology tech at BVA  Britton Vision Associates  in Elk City. Then she didn   t work for a few years when her daughter was younger, and now she   s my receptionist.  Finchum Your receptionist? How is that   no. (Laughs)  Gore We actually do pretty well. (Laughter) We do pretty well. She lives here, and we drive to work together and     Finchum    carpool.  Gore Yeah.  Finchum Good sister time.  Gore We get along pretty well for working with each other, but she   s eight years older than me. We were never so close in age that we fought all the time.  Finchum She was already out of, well, high school, but it was all one school. Scratch that.  Gore Yeah, we all went, we were in the same building, but she graduated when I was in elementary school, fifth grade or something like, I think it was fifth or sixth grade. My teenage years, I was an only child pretty much in the house.  Finchum Practice doctor on your dolls as you were growing up, I mean, if you knew from early age that you wanted to be something in medicine.  Gore I really didn   t. That was more of a   in high school really realized that I liked that, wanted to do something in science or the medical field, but I really didn   t do that.  Finchum When it was time to dissect the pig or the frog or whatever it was in high school?23  Gore We did that once.  Finchum Formaldehyde, I couldn   t remember, that smell.  Gore It was fun. (Laughter) We had the cats in undergrad in anatomy. Those were gross. I   m not a big cat fan.  Finchum Well, being on the dairy farm, you probably didn   t   well, I don   t know. Would you have had witnessed birth of a cow?  Gore Oh yeah, yeah. We had a lot of pulling calves.  Finchum You did fine with that?  Gore Yeah, yeah. I watched a lot of that, watched them work the calves and the    cut the calves and dehorn and all that. Never bothered me.  Finchum You didn   t want to be a vet?  Gore No. Smells too bad, I think. What I do, I have some bad smells sometimes, but not on a daily basis. (Laughter)  Finchum Well, you could have been a nurse instead of a doctor.  Gore Could have.  Finchum Didn   t consider that?  Gore No.  Finchum I don   t know what the difference is between a doctor of osteopathic and an MD. Is there much difference between the two?  Gore Not a lot. The schooling or the basis, the time in school is all the same. They   re structured a little bit different with   we have a really big focus on the function of the body being a result of the structure and looking at the body as a whole and also pulling in emotional problems as being a cause of physical problems and making sure we   re dealing with that part of it in addition to giving medication for whatever physical problem there is. Then we also have more training in the, just the structure of the body with the osteopathic manipulation, restoring the normal structure of the body. We have the manipulation that we can do, too. That   s an extra class that we have. Otherwise, they   re pretty much the same. Sometimes you can walk in an office and see a DO and not know the difference.  Finchum I   ve been to both, and it seems that DOs are more personal, personable.24  Gore Yeah, I   ve heard that a lot from patients. Our manipulation classes start the first year. We start putting hands on patients our first year because we use each other as patients learning the structure of the body, and then we learn all the different techniques with manipulation and practice that on each other. Then we go home and practice it on our families to learn it. I think that has a lot to do with when we get into rotations and residency and being able to just walk up and put your hands on a patient. We don   t have any reserve about that because we   re used to it, and then I think it   s just, a lot of the philosophy behind looking at the whole patient and being able to talk to the patient and get the history and get them to feel comfortable, to be able to open up to you and talk to you about their deeper problems that they don   t usually want to talk to anybody about. That has a lot to do with   .  Finchum The word manipulation is being, in that sense, just means hands-on?  Gore Yeah, it   s hands-on. Somebody comes in with back pain, neck pain, we put our hands on and see if, check the alignment of the spine, and we have different techniques, as far as being able to realign that. That   s the really unique part about what we do. It   s like chiropractic but different. There   s more to it, but it   s, that   s the unique part about being a DO is being able to do that.  Finchum Do you remember graduation day?  Gore Yes. I do. (Laughs)  Finchum Who all came?  Gore That was a big day. My parents were there and my father-in-law, and my grandpa went and my sister, niece, a lot of people there.  Finchum They did the wave when they said your name?  Gore No. (Laughter) No air horns or anything. (Laughter)  Finchum Did all eighty-eight finish that started with you?  Gore We had some changes in our class. I know there   s one that had a baby, and she ended up finishing the year after us, I think. We had one that was in the class ahead of us that had an accident and was in the hospital for a while and ended up finishing with us in our class. There was some changes. I   m not exactly sure the number that we graduated with. I   ve forgotten over eleven years or so.  Finchum Pretty close to the number that came in with you.25  Gore Close, yes, yeah.  Finchum Was there ever a moment when you thought,    Oh, I   m not going to finish    or    I can   t finish    or    I wish I hadn   t picked this   ?  Gore That one, yes. (Laughter) Our first year, our anatomy class was, there was just so much information. People, they tell you, they try to prepare you for what you   re going to go through, but the amount of knowledge that you go through in a week in medical school is just unreal. It took a long time to, and figuring out the different teaching styles of the professors because it was nothing like what we had in undergrad. We finally figured out our anatomy professor and started doing better in that class, but that one was tough. Then you had anatomy lab and a lot of hours of studying and dissecting. It was just overwhelming at first, but you get the hang of it. You know what you have to do in your study time. It   s just a big adjustment, a big change.  Finchum Husband help quiz you     Gore Some, yes.  Finchum    or defuse you maybe?  Gore Yeah. (Laughter) He was very patient, four years and in residency, seven years. Yeah, he worked full time in Tulsa and hated it there. He drove a   worked for Coca-Cola and drove a truck in the traffic over there. He was a very angry man sometimes when he got home. (Laughs) We came home a lot on the weekends, and he didn   t usually have to work on the weekends. We   d come home. He   d help my dad on the farm, and I would study.  Finchum A whole different atmosphere.  Gore Being able to get   just getting away because we either stayed in our house over there or we   d go visit our friend, but getting out and doing all that, we didn   t have the money for that. I was in med school. We would get bored just staying at home. Coming here on the weekends helped just to get away.  Finchum Traffic between here and there   . (Laughs)  Gore Yeah.  Finchum Although, there   s some, they go pretty fast out here, the big trucks, but not as, it   s not a lot, not in six lanes or whatever you do.  Gore We had it down. We   d leave Friday evening and get out here, and we usually didn   t leave to go back home until eight o   clock Sunday night. We came back to Tulsa about eleven, eleven-thirty. We got home late a lot. 26  Finchum When you left there, was Durant your only choice? I mean, could you have picked something out this way?  Gore No. Well, there   s a residency in Enid  Oklahoma  that I looked at, several in Oklahoma City. That was probably the closest out this way.  Finchum What did he do there if you didn   t     Gore In Durant? He worked for a construction company when we first moved down there, and then after I had my daughter, he stayed home with her for six months. Then he got tired of being at home. He actually worked at our clinic, our resident clinic, at the front desk and did that until we moved back out here.  Finchum He   s a little bit of everything?  Gore Yeah.  Finchum That   s good.  Gore He   s more of an outdoor person.  Finchum He   s happy now on the farm.  Gore Yeah. He does the farming and works for an oil and gas company here in town, and he   s also the reserve deputy for Dewey County and works Leedey. We had a town cop that retired this year. He took that over. He stays busy...  Finchum Sounds like you both do.  Gore    and he   s a volunteer fireman. (Laughs) He   s on the EMT board...  Finchum That was my next question     Gore    the ambulance board.  Finchum He might as well learn to be an EMT if he   s doing all of that.  Gore (Laughs) Yeah, yeah. He actually went to class, but he didn   t pass the test the first time. He didn   t go back and take it again. Then I was like,    You got a lot of jobs here. Might just leave that one out,    but he can drive the ambulance for them if they only have two of them to be in the back, he can drive the ambulance, and he does that. 27  Finchum I would imagine that   s part of being in a small community. The men and women, I guess, have various roles they play like that.  Gore Yeah, yeah, and I took over the ambulance medical director about a year ago, I guess. I do that now, too.  Finchum Are you the only doctor in town?  Gore Yeah.  Finchum You envision staying here, period, not moving to Woodward or anything like that?  Gore No, not unless something changes, but as long as my parents are here to help with the kids if I can   t get home or whatever, that   s   probably won   t ever leave. (Laughs) It gets old driving sometimes, but it   s not   .  Finchum Elk City was closer, wasn   t it?  Gore About eight miles, yeah, sixteen miles total a day.  Finchum Well, not much difference.  Gore Not a lot different, no.  Finchum We   ve covered most of what I wanted to ask. We   ve talked about rural care. They told me to,    Be sure and ask if she makes house calls.    You said yes, you do.  Gore Yes, I do some. Rural health care is a   it   s a big, the school has really gotten into a lot of trying to recruit rural doctors because we do have such a shortage now. Just in Elk City and Woodward, there is a shortage there. In Woodward, we have some nurse practitioners that have came in. That   s really helped take some of the load off, but a lot of the chronic, really debilitated patients that have a lot of problems, they can   t take care of. They have limitations on prescribing and things like that. We still need a lot of doctors. They   re just predicting that to get worse, though, as far as the shortage of physicians in rural areas.  Finchum They   re pushing more for physician   s assistants, nurses to go back and get their   .  Gore Yes, physician extenders. We definitely use them, and then, glad we have them.28  Finchum About how big is your caseload here? I mean, the town is four or 500 people.  Gore I usually, on Thursdays, when I   m here, typically see thirty people, and some days twenty-five, some days thirty-five.  Finchum Makes for a long day, if you   re seeing that many.  Gore Thursdays are long days, yeah. They   re busy days. I have Wednesday afternoons I take for charting and administrative things that I have to get done, but I usually see around fifteen every Wednesday morning. Then my other days, I have anywhere from seventeen or eighteen to twenty-five or twenty-six, but it just depends on the day and what   s going on, what season it is.  Finchum Allergy season?  Gore We   re getting into the busy cold and flu season. It   s starting to get busy.  Finchum Do you take a flu shot?  Gore I do. I do two a year. I do one in October and one in January. Stay covered. I have asthma. I don   t take any chances.  Finchum I don   t. (Laughter) I should, but I don   t. You consider Leedey home. Has it changed much since you were little to now?  Gore It has. There are a lot of people here now that have moved in that didn   t grow up around here and have those roots, but we still have young people moving back. They grew up here.  Finchum Was there ever a movie theater in town     Gore I think there was a long time ago.  Finchum    in your lifetime?  Gore Not in my lifetime.  Finchum There is a grocery store     Gore There is a grocery store.  Finchum    and the post office is still here.  Gore Post office is still here.29  Finchum The school   s still here. Those are big, three big things.  Gore Yeah, those are pretty big ones, yes. We have a lumberyard and a bank   .  Finchum Do you have a library?  Gore We do not have a public library. They have the mobile library that comes around. We have a museum that   s got a lot of neat   there was a tornado here back in the    40s, and they   ve got a lot of neat memorabilia from that in there. We have a flower shop, drug store, pharmacy, couple other gift shops, and salons. There   s really a lot of businesses here.  Finchum It   s alive, though.  Gore Yeah. Yeah, there are a lot of businesses here, and people are good about supporting local.  Finchum How many are in one grade at school, a class, twenty or thirty?  Gore It varies, but my daughter   s fifth grade class has thirteen or fourteen. My youngest daughter   s pre-K class has twenty-four.  Finchum Like a little, a bubble. (Laughs)  Gore My son   s kindergarten class has twenty. They   re pretty big classes, but yeah, anywhere from ten or eleven to twenty-five. Typically, we don   t have any more than that in a class.  Finchum Twenty or less is, makes for a nice size classroom, really.  Gore Yeah, yeah, and classrooms are usually a good size. Pre-K and kindergarten have some aides in there helping with since they have so many, but it   s a really good school. Our superintendent actually graduated from here. He was two years older than me.  Finchum Has an interest in keeping it local.  Gore Yeah. It   s a great school.  Finchum Well, when you need to get something other than what the grocery store might have, you go to   what   s the closest city, I guess Woodward?  Gore Elk City would be or Clinton.  Finchum Clinton, okay. I forget that.30  Gore Those three are similar distances.  Finchum Well, congratulations on getting to come back home.  Gore Thanks. We   ve really enjoyed it.  Finchum The Razor sounds fun.  Gore Yeah. (Laughter) You   ll have to go check those out now. (Laughter)  Finchum If there   s nothing else, we   ll say thank you and close out.  Gore Thank you.  Finchum Thank you.  -------  -------
