 Nykolaiszyn with the Oklahoma State University  Library. Today is Saturday, August 8th, 2009 and we   re in Stillwater,  Oklahoma at the Stillwater Public Library interviewing Marguerite  Scruggs. Today   s interview is being conducted as part of our  Spotlighting Oklahoma: Life in the 1930s Oral History Project.  Marguerite, let   s begin by learning a little more about you. Can you tell  us where you grew up and where you were born and a little bit about  your family?  Yes. I was born in 1920 in Lawton, Oklahoma in their hospital. My  family that I grew up in included my parents, P.G. Scruggs and  Marguerite Anthony Scruggs, and a brother who was seven years  younger than I. And today the memory is focusing on life in Sayre,  Oklahoma, where my family moved when I was five years old. All of  my public school was in Sayre schools. My dad was the county agent, it  was called then, of Beckham County, the Cooperative Extension  Service, working through Oklahoma A M College. We even had some  visits at home with Henry G. Bennett, who came out to visit. Those were  real highlights. I was focusing really on the 1930s and remembering  1929   I was nine years old   and the crash on Wall Street.  Well, I should say my family also is interesting in that my mother was  born and grew up her whole life, until her marriage, in Louisville,  Kentucky and was Catholic. My dad, the family homesteaded near  Lawton, Oklahoma on a farm when my dad was seven years old and he  grew up on this farm. My grandmother Scruggs believed so much in  education   I think my granddad did too, but mainly my grandmother  emphasized it. She had taught normal school in Missouri before they  came to Oklahoma. Dad completed eight years in the rural school, eight  grades. And then the family couldn   t help him financially, but he moved  to Lawton during the weeks   I think Cameron had high school then, a  boarding school, and he completed high school, earning all his way  5  distributing newspapers. Then he came to Oklahoma A M College and  earned his bachelor   s degree in agronomy. He earned every cent of the  way, living and school. And then he taught at Cameron.  My first three years I lived with my parents (laughs) in the boy   s dorm at  Cameron because Dad taught agriculture and chemistry in the high  school and junior college. And how he met my mother is a wonderful  story, but there isn   t time for it. But it was due to World War I when he  was stationed in Louisville, Kentucky. Dad was Methodist and he  promised Mother that he would help her get to church when she needed  to and practice her Catholic faith and help her raise any children that  came Catholic. And that is meaningful to me throughout my whole life.  Dad eventually joined the Catholic Church, after he retired   another  story we could talk about, which is less pleasant. I   m sure the reason he  did not join the Catholic Church before retirement is that he would not  have been kept on the job. And I myself could give you some  experiences in discrimination. But that   s meaningful in terms of how we  lived our lives, actually.  Well 1929, when Wall Street crashed, it didn   t mean as much to our  family or most families (except the indirect result) as it does today  because my family and most other middle-class people didn   t invest in  stocks on Wall Street. I don   t imagine mutual funds existed, for  example. My parents invested in farms over the years, but not in Wall  Street. (Laughs) But I do remember, and I think it would   ve been shortly  after this, that there was a possibility that Dad would be fired from his  job. Now in cooperative extension, the money and the programs and so  on come through cooperation of the federal government, the state,  particularly the land grant university, and the county. And the county  commissioners were probably thinking they couldn   t afford to have a  county agent. But farmers came forth in support and he did not lose his  job. In fact, he worked there until he retired in the 1950s.  But I remember as a child, and I was elementary school age, nine years,  ten years old, I was supposed to go to a birthday party the next day when  Mother and Dad told me about the possibility of his losing his job. And I  remember saying,    Well, I could give up something I have to be the  birthday present. We wouldn   t have to buy anything.    And they told me,     Oh no, we can buy something.    I imagine it would have been an  investment of 98 cents or something in those days, you know, at  Winter   s Variety Store (laughter) in Sayre. But I remember that offering,  I   d give up something, and they wouldn   t let me.  Then next Franklin D. Roosevelt was elected President in the fall of  1932. That I remember; I was twelve. He would not have been coming  into office however until sometime in March in those days. They were  6  Nykolaiszyn  Scruggs  inaugurated in March, not in January as  they are  now. And almost  immediately, I remember, he closed all the banks. This was unexpected.  Well, I think it was. It was to the people around Sayre, anyway.  (Laughs) But people were making a run on the banks and in order to  save them, this was I think Roosevelt   s first major action, to handle the  Depression. So I do not remember how our family handled the fact that  you couldn   t get any money from the bank for awhile. I don   t remember  how long they were closed. Not for a long, long time. But our family  operated in a frugal way always. My parents were good managers of  their resources, really. And we then continued to have our garden. We  always had a Jersey cow so we   d have plenty of milk and cream. I  remember the thick cream on the gallon crocks of milk that were kept  cold in the winter by putting them in the north bedroom window.   Gallon crocks were earthenware bowls that would hold one gallon of  liquid.  But we did have an ice man as I recall, later   maybe always. It  may have been my grandmother that had to keep things cold in the  window.  When the cow would have a calf, if it was a bull calf, it would be  butchered at an appropriate time for the meat. And Mother would can all  the meat because this was the days before freezers. The first freezing  came in the form of freezers in the community where people would take  their meat to be processed usually and kept there in the size of roasts,  and so on and so forth, that they wanted. And certainly there were no  home freezers. (Laughs) So Mother canned all of it and that would last  all year, maybe. I don   t remember. She also canned lots of Swiss chard  from the garden, green beans, we had squash, lettuce, radishes, beets, the  usual common vegetables. We didn   t raise any melons because we  didn   t really have that big a garden space. But money was managed  well. Then later Mother and I would make our dresses and I don   t think  we made shirts really for my brother and father, but mostly we did our  own sewing.  Would you buy fabric?  Yes. Although I do remember the feed sacks. And you could get  different patterns when you bought feed. I don   t think that we ever made  dresses, but we made aprons or something like that. But many of the  women, you   d try to get the feed in the pattern you wanted and get  enough of the sacks in that pattern to make a garment that was needed.  But we didn   t have to depend on that completely. Actually, you know  Dad was getting a salary the whole time. Not a tremendous salary and I  can   t tell you how much, but that was fortunate.  Our house was a well-built house, two-bedroom, one bathroom between  the two bedrooms, a living room, dining room, and kitchen. And then a  7  Nykolaiszyn  Scruggs  Nykolaiszyn  Scruggs  four-room   the basement was as large as the house. And it actually had  plastered walls for four rooms but we never used them as part of the  house, it was storage and our sand pile was down there. (Laughs) You  had to go outside to go into the basement, but it was fixed so if you  wanted to, you could have it as part of the living space.  Where would you keep the cow?  The house had the roof extended over the drive and so our car was kept  outside and the garage became   I didn   t mention our chickens, we had  chickens, too. But the garage became the barn for the cow and for the  chickens. And I was trying to think how in the world did it have that  much space in it and how was that arranged? And I can   t remember  details, although I helped with the milking. (Laughter) We had the eggs  and the chickens for meat. So the whole backyard really was garden and  the area was all fenced in. The cow and the chickens were in the same  area, fenced in.  Was it in the city of Sayre you lived?  Yes, in kind of the north edge of town. There was a filling station right  next door. Our medical doctor lived at the other end of the block. He  played an important role actually in our health. (Laughs) He was a very  concerned, caring physician. My brother   it would   ve been during this  time, as he was growing up, he also sold raw milk. His name was Paul,  and he   s no longer living actually. But he had Paul   s Dairy, raw milk,  because our one cow gave lots of milk because she was a good cow and  well-fed and well cared for. But also, Mr. Fuller, the man that ran the  filling station next door, it doesn   t sound like a very attractive place, but  actually Dad, with his background and experience, knowledge, he had  the most beautiful yard in town. Because he put down black soil, loam  soil and cow manure and sand and really cared for things. The driveway  made a circle around the whole house. Well Mr. Fuller let my brother  Paul have the concession for the pop, the cold drinks, in his filling  station one summer. It was Paul   s first experience with handling money  and he would be over there at the filling station a lot of the time, selling  his pop. (Laughs)  When FDR then really took thoughtful action in regard to the  Depression, apparently Hoover, the previous President, did not take  much action. And the cooperative extension offices in every county  probably in the whole United States were the only agency or institution  that had someone everywhere locally. So when the USDA programs  were set into action suddenly the county agents, who probably thought  they had a full job already, were given the job of leadership in the  counties for all these new programs. And I remember working in Dad   s  8  Nykolaiszyn  office during some of the summers. His office was on the second floor  of the courthouse in Sayre, a small room. This classroom is at least three  times as large as his office was. It was an ordinary office. And it was on  the front of the building in the middle. Well, that turned out to be  important soon.  One of the first things that happened, the price for farm products was  terribly low, partly because of over-production. I remember one of the  first programs involved cotton. There was a lot of criticism later about  plowing up the cotton. But this meant that all the farmers needed to  come into the county agent   s office and sign up that they wanted to  participate in these programs. All the farms had to be measured, the  fields measured and plotted and so they knew then from the records how  many acres of cotton were in each field. Then there was some agreement  of how much of this was going to be destroyed. It was an effort to  control the amount produced and, hopefully, increase the price. Well,  first of all, can you imagine? It   s unimaginable for the whole country for  these kinds of things to be happening. And the county agents were the  ones asked to be in charge, so there had to be measuring of these fields. I  remember a test that was administered by my dad and it was a national  one, I imagine. And I remember that Mr. Katner, the math teacher (I  took all the math I could because I liked it) brought some of the high  school boys down. Well they had never heard of measuring    I hadn   t  either   land with chains. Not feet or yards or whatever. But anyway,  that was a shock to them.  Well these were measured and all, but the scene that I want to recall for  you is when the action had taken place in terms of destroying certain  number of acres of cotton on the part of each of the farmers raising  cotton. And the first time then that checks were to come for the farmers,  they were all sent at once. And the notices that went to the farmer   and  I don   t know whether this went from federal or from the county offices,  I think federally, but I   m not sure   all went out at the same time. Well  these men   and I don   t remember any women; there may   ve been but  not many   were desperate for the money because maybe they hadn   t  gotten any in months and months. So they all came the first day that they  could. And by the time the office would open at 8 AM, the halls on the  first floor and second floor were full of these men and the whole  courtyard outside, hundreds, hundreds of men. Noise, oh my goodness.  Everybody wanted their check immediately. Well, it was frightening.  And the Sheriff   s Office was in the courthouse so they helped. In fact  the sheriff restrained one man who had a gun who was headed for my  dad because he wasn   t getting his check soon enough.  Wow.  9  Scruggs  Nykolaiszyn  Scruggs  Nykolaiszyn  Scruggs  They worked out a system and they distributed numbers. Well the  distribution of the numbers was something. I don   t recall exactly how  they achieved this, but they did. They got numbers handed out. I think  the sheriff   s men would have to accompany    Suddenly instead of  having one secretary for the whole program, there were six or eight  clerks, women. I don   t know whether they would be able to distribute  the numbers. Everybody was so crushed in. It was just like a mob. And I  don   t mean to be belittling the character of these men because some of  them were patient. But they were desperate. They needed this money  and it had come. They opened a window on the front of the courthouse  and they announced out the window and in the hall that they would be  calling out the numbers and people would be served in the order of the  numbers. That way they could leave the halls for awhile. There was just  a mob scene. They   d call out the numbers from the window on the  second floor and the men would come up. I remember, too, being  shocked at the number of men who couldn   t read and write. Now it  wasn   t large numbers, but somehow it hadn   t occurred to me there  would be people in Beckham County who signed an X and had to have a  witness sign that this is this person.  Wow.  And, of course, they had to sign the contract first and then they had to  sign that they got their check. But that mob scene   never again did they  send all the checks at once. They were so desperate, they didn   t wait till  the second day. Or the second hour. (Laughter) You know, they really  needed this money. Now, that was a scene I   ll never forget.  Do you remember when other items had to be destroyed, like cattle and  hogs?  Yes. I remember, yes. Not details, but cattle particularly. I don   t think  they raised as many hogs in Beckham County. Later I worked in Iowa at  Iowa State University and I thought it was so strange in Oklahoma we  had the cattle out in the field and the few hogs we had in a pen   we  being the farmers, not me. In Iowa it was just reverse. The cattle were in  the pens and the hogs were out in the fields. (Laughter) It was a different  type of rearing the cattle and the hogs for their meat. Interesting. But  yes, they couldn   t get feed for the cattle, so they received money, I   m  quite sure, for destroying some of the cattle and hogs, I didn   t remember  about hogs, probably because it wasn   t as big a production.  Another thing I remember is the grasshoppers. There was a period of  time when clouds of grasshoppers came and they would just cover a  field. Somebody referred to them as the buzzing clouds. But there was a  program of distributing grasshopper poison. And again, the county agent  10  Nykolaiszyn  Scruggs  was in charge. (Laughs) And barrels   like barrels the size of oil  barrels   came with molasses. Molasses were in the barrels and poison.  And the county seat (at least I know they did this in Sayre, maybe they  did it in surrounding communities but I don   t know) they mixed this  poison mixture, molasses and poison. I think it was cottonseed hulls that  were the base and they mixed them up. Well they were not as familiar  with the problems of toxicity of poisons. And I know my dad got a  terrible rash because he was helping. If he was supervising, he also  probably was part of doing the job but showing people how to do it.  I don   t know how the farmers carried the poison back to their farms,  whether they just put it in their trucks or wagons. They spread this  poison along the fence lines and hoped to get rid of the grasshoppers.  But to me it seemed like a hopeless job because when that crowd of  grasshoppers would just move across the field, there was nothing left  when they had left. They would destroy whatever was growing. But the  grasshopper poison and I know my dad was almost getting ill from not  being involved every minute, but enough. And I remember the shelter  belts. I reviewed the book by Timothy Egan, I think it is.  The Worst Hard Time?  The Worst Hard Time. And he said this program existed in Texas,  Oklahoma, and Kansas. I knew Oklahoma had it. But these trees were  shipped into the county seat by train. And many men were employed  planting these shelter belts. And as I recall, and you can still see some of  them in existence, there would be I think at least three parallel rows,  maybe four or five rows, I can   t remember. And the length of it would  vary from like a city block, only it   s out in the farm, to protect the  farmstead, the home and the barns and so on. And just to serve to cut  down on the wind, the erosion therefore, and hopefully eventually help  with reducing erosion and the effects on the destruction of crops really.  I also remember then that at the end of the big rush of getting all these  planted, there were a lot of trees, seedlings (when planted they   d be  about three feet high or so) left. In order to save them, we gave our  garden plot up. And hundreds, maybe thousands of these little trees were  planted just one against the other. They couldn   t grow that way, but they  could survive for awhile in real close rows together. And I remember  lying down on the ground and looking. If you looked under there and the  trees had green leaves, they all seemed to be a similar variety. But the  shelter belts had a variety of types of trees, so why these were all the  same I don   t know. They looked like, as I think about it, maybe a kind of  elm or deciduous tree of some kind. I   d lie down there and it   d look like  a huge miniature forest (laughter) with all these trees and real close  together, you know. Well, this close together in rows and the rows about  11  Nykolaiszyn  Scruggs  Nykolaiszyn  Scruggs  this far apart over the whole garden.  I don   t know how long those lasted, but they were all used. They  gradually then used all of them for shelter belts, but this way my dad  kept them alive for a longer period of time, a matter of months I think,  not a whole year. But that   s part of my memory of the shelter belts. And  they did help. Although it was so terrible. They were planted east-west.  Timothy Egan said they started out north-south and decided that won   t  work so they were all in lines east-west. And if you see them, that   s the  way they are.  So did you see a lot of blowing dirt around Sayre?  Yes. I   m saving that till last because I was thinking that the emphasis  was on the Depression, but the Depression and the Dust Bowl blend  together.  Sure. Oh yeah.  (Laughs) It was a part of life. Yes, there were two kinds of storms   at  least two, but two main kinds. What I would call sand storms, and what  we   d call sand storms, it was sand and red dirt and usually strong wind  and it would just grind paint off of things and so on. And there were the  dusters. The dusters were the black soil from Kansas and Iowa, maybe  others, but it was the consistency of face powder or maybe pumice.  (Laughs) Those would usually roll in. I   ll describe Black Sunday, which  I remember. I know it was a Sunday, April 29th, 1935. It was a sunny  day and Mother and Dad and Paul and I were at home. Paul and I  would   ve gone to what we call Catechism Sunday morning because we  only had   the priest lived in Elk City. So we had second Sunday Mass  at 8:30 and fourth Sunday Mass at 10:30. And at 10:30 Mass, different  families would serve lunch afterwards  in their homes    dinner for the  priest and the altar boy who came from Elk City. I counted up last night  and it would not have been a second or fourth Sunday, so we just had  Catechism. Then at about 4 PM, we looked outside and the whole  northwest sky and north sky was just black as midnight. It was just solid  black and coming our way. And so Dad had built a storm   now we   d  say storm shelter, but we called it a storm cellar I think or storm cave,  but anyway we had one. I think he had put an electric cord down through  the ventilation system so we   d have light if the electricity was working.  We   d have a candle if it wasn   t.  So the four of us went to our storm cellar because this looked terrible, it  was just black, the blackest I   ve ever seen. We hadn   t been in the cellar  very long when we heard voices. It turned out to be the neighbors across  the street, a couple. They had started over and they almost got to our  12  storm cellar when the storm arrived. They couldn   t see where the cellar  was. Dad, when he heard the voices he opened up the cellar door and  they could see our light. We could see that it was black   from a sunny  day like today to absolute dark in a matter of minutes. The people were  able to come down then and that   s what I remember about that.  Now, for a long time when we   d go to bed at night   and that   s why I  mentioned we had a solid house, it was tile and stucco on the outside. In  addition, we had tight windows but Mother also put some folded  newspaper in to make it even tighter, just force and lock them to be as  tight   you   d swear nothing could get through. We   d go to bed at night  and when we   d wake up in the morning, you could not tell what color  the quilt or the blanket was. It was either black solid or it was reddish  sand, red dirt. You couldn   t see what the design of the quilt was. When  we   d go outside and go to school, we   d wrap a cloth   nowadays we   d  go out and buy a mask, but we didn   t know there were masks I don   t  think (laughter) and the stores didn   t either. We   d wrap to cover   well  you couldn   t cover your eyes cause you couldn   t see, but cover your  nose and mouth and sometimes we would put a wet cloth instead of just  a dry one.  Now in spite of that, in the spring of 1934, my brother had just  completed his first year of school. So he was seven, his birthday was in  March and this was May. He could not go the last day of school because  he became ill. He was just going to pick up his grade card, report card.  He had dust pneumonia and he nearly died. I mean we were really  blessed that he did not die. He was so weak. I was 14 and I remember  reading to him, bless his heart. He had a new little baseball book, How to  Play Baseball and how to throw a curve was part of this. Well, I read  that to him at least three times, the whole book. It wasn   t a huge book, it  was a child   s book. But that came in very fortunate in terms of my  experience later because three years later when I graduated from high  school in 1937, we had parties the last few days in the evenings. And at  one of them the girls and the boys competed with each other and asked  questions and you got points if you got the answer right. It was my time  for the boys to ask me a question and they asked me something they  thought I would not know at all. They asked me how to throw a curve in  baseball. Well, I could not have demonstrated it, but I could sure tell  them. (Laughter) They were so shocked, I remember this. And I felt so  good   But the one time Dad was coming home from one of the men   s meetings  in agriculture in the county and he was terribly late getting home, we  were having a dust storm. And when he got there he said that he really  couldn   t see the road very well and he ended up in some farmer   s front  yard, but he finally found his way back to the road and managed to get  13  Nykolaiszyn  Scruggs  Nykolaiszyn  Scruggs  home. And you read about that kind of thing in The Worst Hard Time.  One of the maps showed that the Dust Bowl stopped at the border  between Beckham County and Roger Mills County. Roger Mills is north  of Beckham County. And I laughed because the dust storm didn   t know  that it was supposed to stop there and it didn   t  (Laughter) But the  farmers were having an awful time, and the people in the towns were,  too.  Well let   s see, I remember in high school we had study hall and it was  really a double classroom size and there were windows on all one side.  And the WPA men were digging a ditch for some utility, I don   t know  whether it was for a water line or what, gas. But it was parallel with the  street and out fairly close to the street. And oh, the men were so thin.  They were skinny, skinny, skinny. And they shoveled a third of the time  and two thirds of the time they leaned on the shovel handle. So the high  school boys would say,    I hope those handles are strong cause they may  not hold those men up.    (Laughs) Well, you couldn   t blame them really  because I don   t see how they had the strength to dig anything. But that  was their employment and their only source of money at all. And I know  that they were not thought of as very good workers   well they couldn   t  be. They didn   t have the food and the energy to be.  What did your family think about Roosevelt?  Well, very complimentary I   d say. Those programs were essential. I   m  sure we could think of weaknesses about them. And there was criticism  for destroying food or destroying the cattle and so on, but these were  desperate times. We hear more now than we did then about the problems  of Eleanor Roosevelt. I did get to see her several times later,  professionally. But all was not well with their marriage, I guess. There  were some sad things there. She was an outstanding woman also. But I  feel very good about Roosevelt and so did my parents. And goodness,  there weren   t any Republicans around. Everybody in Oklahoma was a  Democrat. Then I went to Iowa and everybody at Iowa was a Republican  and now it   s kind of reversed  (Laughter) Things get more and more  complicated and I won   t express my strong beliefs at the moment. But  yes, praise in general for Roosevelt.  It must have been very difficult for your father to be on the front lines.  Oh, well he was a dedicated man and he wanted to be helpful. And the  farmers appreciated him very much. He was a farmer. He was much  more comfortable in his khakis than in his dress suit. He really was a  farmer. And here was this   my mother was city all the way through, but  she said that my dad   s mother was absolutely wonderful to her and  understood what an adjustment this must be to live in Oklahoma where  14  Nykolaiszyn  Scruggs  Nykolaiszyn  Scruggs  Nykolaiszyn  Scruggs  her friends  in Kentucky  were terribly worried about the Indians.  (Laughs) You know, still in those days there still was a lot of ignorance  and ignorance about religion, too. I mean fear because of lack of  knowledge. Yes. Dad did, he did also and other county agents did too  I   m sure, but another program that was pushed and I don   t remember the  timing, was terracing. I remember holding the   I don   t know what the  stick is that has the elevation marked on it   for my dad to do some  marking for terracing on one of our farms. And the thing slipped, I was  so concerned about maybe I had ruined the whole process. (Laughs) I  hadn   t, but terracing was also an important contribution. I don   t think  you got money for it particularly, I don   t remember. But my dad worked  very hard, long hours, and was appreciated, in general. I don   t remember  any problems, really. But I   m sure there were some people not happy     well, the man with the gun wasn   t happy. (Laughs)  Did you enjoy going out and helping him with the different projects?  Yes, although that wasn   t done a lot. My brother was very active in  FFA, which was handled, of course, through vocational education and I  was a vocational home economics teacher later. But we didn   t  participate in the 4-H programs as children. I think I figured out why  they didn   t really have a program in the town of Sayre in the schools. I  think that both my brother and I would   ve expected to be one of the  leaders and that might have been a problem for my dad. So it was not a  problem because we didn   t join. And it could   ve brought on jealousies.  This is absolutely ridiculous, but one of my first performances I recited a  poem at one of the   I don   t know whether it was a 4-H meeting or   it  was adults, so it wouldn   t have been. And Dad was probably giving  information and so on, and so a proud parent, you know. And I really  think that I was probably five years old or six. The first poem I ever  recited. And if you want me to, I can recite it.  That would be wonderful.  There was a little chigger  wasn   t any bigger  than the point on a very small pin.  But the bump that it raises  itches like blazes  and that   s where the rub comes in. (Laughter)  And after all of these years.  Well, just for fun I remember it. (Laughter) And I bet the people  couldn   t understand what I said, you know. I have no idea. Oh, dear.  15  Nykolaiszyn  Scruggs  Nykolaiszyn  Scruggs  Nykolaiszyn  Scruggs  Nykolaiszyn  Scruggs  Nykolaiszyn  Scruggs  That really raised the level of our conversation   Well earlier you mentioned how your family lived a very frugal way     Yes.     during the Depression. What were some of the things they did?  Well, not only in the Depression but always. And you know, I really  don   t think of a lot of things were different for our immediate family  during the Depression because we had always been so frugal. And we  were fortunate in that Dad had a job.  Right.  We probably were more careful. I doubt it, really. Dad did a lot of the  work on his car, I mean if the car wasn   t running right, why for years my  brother wasn   t old enough so I held the flashlight for Dad and I learned a  lot about cars. Now, I haven   t mentioned my mother a lot and it   s only  because of what we   ve been talking about. Because my brother tended to  help Dad more when he got old enough and I helped Mother and loved  it, really. It was fun to clean the house and so on. But, he did his own car  repair. That would   ve been one thing. We didn   t buy clothes except as  absolutely essential. We looked like most other people. (Laughs) And  Mother wasn   t the best seamstress in the world, but you know, I looked  decent. I was sometimes disappointed that I couldn   t have those store-bought  clothes.  Sure.  But the canning of the food was probably increased during that time. It  wasn   t until World War II that we had the rationing and the red and blue  coupons and so on for different things. That   s later. And I   ve really been  trying to think what the sacrifices were that we made. Well if we made  them, we did it happily apparently because nothing sticks out other than  we just didn   t   I couldn   t tell you what restaurants there were in Sayre.  We never ate out.  Well let   s talk a little bit about what meals were like. What did Mom  cook?  One thing very disappointing for my mother was she liked to put  tomatoes in lots of things and Dad didn   t like them. (Laughter) But  anyway, we would have macaroni and cheese. We wouldn   t have meat  more than once a day and sometimes not once. But, she prepared  breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Dad would drive home, it was a little town  16  Nykolaiszyn  Scruggs  Nykolaiszyn  Scruggs  you know, he   d come home for lunch. We didn   t have school lunches  then so we   d take our lunch to school or sometimes Dad would pick me  up and we   d go home for lunch and he   d take me back to school.  What would you take to school?  Well, it   d be a sandwich of some kind. I don   t remember anything   later  there would be peanut butter and jelly, but I don   t think that was ever  one of our mainstays. Probably cheese sandwiches, maybe lunchmeat,  there was lunchmeat I think.  Would she make the bread or would you buy the bread from the store?  No. Mother would rarely bake the bread because she wasn   t strong  enough physically to really knead it and stir it the way it needed to be. I  think we had a big kettle like thing that was a bread maker, but not like  today. It had a cranking something where you stirred and it kind of  kneaded, but she didn   t use it very much because she really didn   t have  the strength in her arms to do that. So we were just thrilled when finally  we got sliced bread. Oh, that was an occasion. And it was funny because  Mother could not   you could tell whether Dad or Mother sliced the  bread. If Dad sliced the bread, you   d look at the rest of the loaf and it   d  be straight, you know. If Mother did, it   d be this way. (Laughter) It  didn   t make any difference, it was just a joke. It was fun that Mother  never could slice bread with straight slices and Dad was very precise.  I remember Mother   oh, she made the best chicken and noodles. And  she made her own noodles. We had a cabinet, a Sellers S-E-L-L-E-R  cabinet that had a pull-out top workspace that was porcelain. She would  roll out at least one big thing and sometimes two and leave them to kind  of dry. This round thing would dry on this porcelain top and then she   d  slice it on a bread board into the noodles and cook them. And one time,  we usually had a pet or pets, dogs   one dog at a time, or a cat. Well we  had Jerry, a Persian cat, amber colored Persian cat. One time Mother had  the noodles drying on the cabinet and we came in and  one part of the  dough was  pulled up and there were little paw prints on it. (Laughter)  But I can assure you, we ate them, the chicken and noodles. She liked to  make what were called baked tomatoes. It was canned tomatoes with  bits of bread in it and baked in the oven. Very simple. She didn   t do that  very often because Dad didn   t really like the tomatoes. But she made  wonderful desserts, cakes. We would have these canned vegetables or  fresh vegetables in the summer.   We, as a family of four, always had dinner at noon and supper in the  evening. For these meals we sat at the dining room table in the dining  room. The table was covered with a table cloth (usually linen),  17  Nykolaiszyn  Scruggs  Nykolaiszyn  Scruggs  Nykolaiszyn  Scruggs  appropriate dishes, silverware, glassware, napkins, etc.  A favorite, if  you had company or if this was dinner for the priest, was roast beef with  potatoes and carrots and onions in with the roast. That was very good.  And she would make rolls, very good rolls, hot rolls. That she did, the  bread no, that was purchased. And once it was sliced, it was just that  white fluffy bread that this was as good for you as the whole grain.  Green beans, we didn   t have mashed potatoes everyday but it would be a  protein and then vegetables, sliced tomatoes rather than mixed salads a  lot   we raised tomatoes. And always a dessert of some kind: cakes,  pies, cookies.  Do you have a favorite dessert?  Well, I   m diabetic now. She developed diabetes late in life and her  mother and Dad   s mother did so I was almost bound to, each generation  a little later in life. And mine   s under control. It was easier to control  mine because of advances in medicine. But a favorite dessert, one time  she went all out and she baked an angel food cake and a chocolate angel  food cake at the same time. So she asked at suppertime,    Which would  we like to have tonight?    And Dad said,    Both.    (Laughter)  Smart man.  And we had both  Her angel food cake, that was one of my favorites. Ice  cream, which in the summertime we would get out the freezer at special  occasions and freeze the ice cream ourselves. She made very good pies,  too. So cakes and pies. And oh my goodness, peanut butter cookies,  those were wonderful. (Laughs)  Well we didn   t really touch upon it, but what was going to school like  when you were ten, eleven, twelve years old?  By that time, well the elementary school was nine or ten blocks away  but we still walked a lot of the time. But the middle school (it wasn   t  called middle school) and high school were only two and a half blocks  or so from our house. I always liked school. And what was it like? Well,  we had English, American literature, always English and grammar was  one subject, math, algebra, geometry, trigonometry. I didn   t have to take  all of that math, I don   t know what was required, one or two years  maybe and I took three. But what else did we have? Geography. I  remember the coach taught history and civics. And the Coach and his  wife, the one that was just our favorite, was the homemaking teacher and  they lived next door. He would have us give reports from newspaper  articles and so on in addition to reading the text. I remember that.  My junior and senior years, I took   well I took home economics in  18  Nykolaiszyn  Scruggs  seventh and eighth grade and the teacher was not a favorite really. So I  didn   t take home economics again until junior and senior year in high  school. That was when Mrs. Brady, the wonderful person next door, was  the teacher. I enjoyed it very much and ended up majoring in it. I  played   well I   ll make you think I was really good, I played basketball.  My parents encouraged me to be active in various things. They didn   t  have to worry about would I study, but they wanted me to mix and so  on. So I played basketball. Now I was real good at sitting on the bench.  (Laughter) And I was the only girl in my class who played basketball so  the class ahead of us one time challenged our class, the girls, to play a  basketball game. Well, the president of our class, who was a boy,  accepted the challenge. I was the only one that knew what was supposed  to happen. (Laughter) So I tried basketball, it was a two-division court in  those days for girls, not boys   well I don   t remember what the boys  were, but I watched. So you were either a forward or a guard   well  there were centers too but they   oh no, it was three-division. There were  forwards, centers, and guards. Well in this one wonderful game I tried  playing each one. I was the only one that knew anything and so it really  didn   t work   What else would you do for fun?  A family had a tennis court in the neighborhood and they were all boys  in the neighborhood, so the boys and I played tennis. I really played with  boys more than girls because that   s who was there. The one thing that  happened that affected our whole school history as far as my class is  concerned, in the first grade when we first started, in the group was the  son of the school superintendent. And this may have affected this, I  don   t know whether it did or not. But they chose about 12 children or so  to join a particular first grade teacher. And she taught the first grade in  this half of the room and then this half of the room did first and second  grade in the same year. And I remember the first day or so, I wasn   t  chosen. I wasn   t aware of this. I remember the teacher had written the  names on the board of   I think she was picking things so she   d get all  the children   s names on the board. And so one was did you have new  shoes to start school? I had new shoes and so did a number of others. So  supposedly she wrote my name on the board, but I never could find it.  (Laughs) In other words, I couldn   t read her writing, I guess. I couldn   t  read Marguerite.  But anyway, my dad heard about this and he went to see the  superintendent. His daughter had not been chosen. I didn   t know this,  you know. So the next day I was asked to join the group. I remember  being at a great disadvantage (this is terrible to get in the records, but it   s  true) because they had started something in their math and each child  was represented by a particular paper car, different colors. And on the  19  Nykolaiszyn  Scruggs  Nykolaiszyn  Scruggs  Nykolaiszyn  Scruggs  Nykolaiszyn  Scruggs  Nykolaiszyn  Scruggs  track around the room, they moved the car according to the score you  made each day on your math test. Those cars were already started and  they were way over and I had to start at the beginning. That really  worried me. I didn   t think it was fair.  Sure.  Well, in a few days I was up there. (Laughter)  It was only a matter of time.  But anyway, we did a complete two grades in one year, half of us in the  room. That teacher was sort of like those rural teachers that taught all  eight grades at the same time. I visited with my cousins where they went  to school in a school like that, so I sort of saw how that operated. And it  wasn   t all bad. The little ones learned from listening to the  older ones .  Now I   ve kind of forgotten what I was going to tell. But through the  years, that meant that we had a greater age range in our class because  others, when we got into third grade, we joined the regular third graders,  and here we were a year younger than we ordinarily would   ve been. But  you know, two things: one, from that time on I always, even  professionally when employed, I was in a number of situations where I  was the youngest, but it provided great opportunities. And so I had the  feeling I was always the youngest. And at 89 I   m still the youngest.  (Laughs) No, not really but it   s still kind of there.  That is good. It keeps you young.  But also in that class, that wider age range and some sort of personalities  made the teachers less comfortable in working with us and deservedly  so. Not me, but of course. It was always others. I think it was the greater  age range. So when we became seniors, the policy changed in the  school. It had always been the policy that the seniors took a senior trip,  sponsored by their sponsors. Our sponsors didn   t think that would be a  good idea. (Laughs) And we didn   t get to have a senior trip.  Well that   s not very fair.  But we really had a good school. And we certainly were not  disadvantaged when we graduated from Sayre High School. We had a  good high school principal and superintendent. I think  there were   really high standards and I was comfortable going on.  And after Sayre High School you went on to   ?  I went to Cameron, which was part of our history and so I went there for  20  two years. They had a junior college. I majored in home economics and  was valedictorian. Then I came to Oklahoma State and majored in home  economics education. This is history and I don   t know whether it   s wise  to mention it or not, but I will, it was part of history. We had  discrimination against Catholics. I   ve never regretted my Catholic faith  and don   t ever. And I understood that people were fearful because we  used this crazy Latin language at the Mass. I still don   t think it   s a good  idea (laughter) and was so glad when it changed to English. In fact,  there   s an interesting story there but it   s not about Oklahoma. But the  Sunday that the whole Catholic world changed to using the vernacular in  Mass, I was in Athens, Greece. I went to Mass for the first time when  they were using the vernacular and I couldn   t understand a word   I was in the top of the university, I don   t know, they didn   t identify top  ten or whatever, but I was there academically. I wasn   t as active in  various things as some other students. But anyway, then I wanted to  teach. Well, I started and I had strong recommendations. I started trying  to get a teaching position and I   d go to the schools to interview and the  city schools wanted experienced teachers. So I interviewed at several  small towns. We would get through the interview and the superintendent  would say,    And what church do you go to?    And I would say,     Catholic.       Oh. Well it doesn   t make any difference to me personally,  but my Board won   t approve. And the community won   t approve.    So I  got to where in applying I would just put it in the letter. There wasn   t  any point in driving to these communities if they weren   t going to  consider me.  My first successful interview in getting a home economics teaching  position was unusual. Our family had been to visit our grandparents near  Lawton. It was a Sunday and we had just gotten home about, I don   t  know, five or six PM. The telephone rang. The superintendent in Cloud  Chief was going to be leaving for meetings in Oklahoma City or  something the next day and he wondered if I could come for an  interview that night. And we said,    Yes.    So the whole family got back  in the car with my dad driving and we drove to Cloud Chief Schools and  I saw their nice one-room home economics department and talked with  the superintendent. He said that the chairman of their school board  would not consider approving any person to teach if he had not  interviewed that person, so he suggested I drive out to this man   s house  out in the country.  Now, Cloud Chief at that time, I don   t know how many people there  were, but there weren   t very many. The grocery store was also the post  office. Maybe they had 100 or so. But anyway, he gave us instructions.  Now, they must not have had a telephone because we could   ve called.  But there were no calls, so I   m thinking maybe they didn   t have a  21  telephone. But Dad was used to driving out in the country. There  weren   t sand storms in 1941. We found the place and Dad parked so that  the car was facing the front door of the house and he left the lights on  and he honked real loud. It was real embarrassing to me. But I walked  up to the door   it was August and so no air conditioning   most homes  did not have it and certainly farm homes did not at that time. All the  windows were open, there were screens on the door, and the front door  was open but it had a screen door that was closed. So I knocked, now  Dad had also honked real loud. Well, it turns out that the man (and I  won   t give his name) had a cattle hauling business and so he had a  number of truck drivers. So he thought that horn was one of his trucks. I  knocked on the door or on the sill and in a very short time I heard this  man say,    It   s a woman  Where are my pants?    And they had gone to  bed. It was oh, 11 o   clock at night or later maybe, I don   t know. He  came to the door and he stepped out on the little sort of porch, just a  platform really, and we did the interview. He asked all sorts of questions  and I answered them. And then we left.  Well, I didn   t hear. It turned out that the superintendent, why he was so  late, because I do not think there were other people they were  considering. Now that may not be right. But he was gone for awhile. He  ran into, of all people, the former superintendent of Sayre schools, who  was a part of the Department of Education in the state office. And he  gave me high recommendations according to the superintendent that told  me later. But he was terribly slow in getting back with me. But that  whole interview is just hilarious, you know.  Well, in August I still didn   t have a job. In August the Cooperative  Extension personnel, county people, from all over the state, have an  August conference. They meet here on campus for continuing education  and planning. So I came up with my dad and was offered a graduate  assistantship. I decided I   d find out what I   d need to do to become a  dietician because a lot of hospitals were operated by Catholics and I  didn   t think it   d be a disadvantage to be a Catholic. I wasn   t going to  change my religion. (Laughter) And I was offered a graduate  assistantship. Then that afternoon there was a call. I had interviewed at  Cloud Chief schools (that   s near Cordell) and that interview is worth  another interview, but it was wonderful. Anyway, I got a call, would I     I had interviewed two weeks  before  but I hadn   t heard. They would  like to have me as their home economics teacher. They were having their  first teachers    meeting that evening at six. And this was about 2 o   clock  in the afternoon. Could I get there for the teachers    meeting?  Well, I found my dad in his meeting on campus and he said,    You take  the car and I   ll find a ride somehow or other.    I took the car, the family  car, drove down and walked into the teachers    meeting just as it was  22  Nykolaiszyn  Scruggs  Nykolaiszyn  Scruggs  Nykolaiszyn  Scruggs  Nykolaiszyn  Scruggs  Nykolaiszyn  Scruggs  starting. And I don   t think I had any supper. (Laughter) But I taught  there for a year and that was 1941. And December 7, 1941 arrived. Then  we teachers had a lot of jobs to do that related to World War II.  The things you had to do to get that job   Well, you just have to be a good person. I mean, and appreciate  everybody. And I did. He was a very competent man. But I can  understand that he thought it was a truck driver. And it wasn   t. But I  didn   t see him at all till he came out to talk with me. But I heard this  voice saying to his wife, I   m sure,    It   s a woman     That was my first  successful interview.  And how long did you teach there?  Only one year. And the reason was that they weren   t going to have  enough girls in the high school to really justify a vocational program the  next year. And then I went to Calumet and I taught there for essentially  four years and then went into the State Office. Lela O   Toole, who was  25 years Dean here  at OSU  was my supervisor when I first taught. She  was getting her Master   s the year that I got my Bachelor   s. Her first job  then was in supervision. And I was one of her teachers.  I   ve heard she was quite the lady.  Yes, she was. She   s also an Oklahoma product from Thomas in western  Oklahoma, sort of central western in a way. But she was very supportive  and later asked me to come be Associate Dean.  How long did you teach at Oklahoma State?  Only 12 years. I came in 1973 and taught. I retired when I was 65 so it  was only 12 years.  Fascinating.  But wonderful opportunities. This is a good story. When I first got here  and was walking down the hall of the then College of Home Economics  building, now Human Environmental Sciences, and a young woman  came up to me, a freshman student. She said,    Are you Dr. Scruggs?    I  said,    Yes.       Well, my      and I thought she was going to say my  mother. See I worked with home economics teachers throughout the  state for six years I guess, and I thought she was going to say my  mother. That   s not what she said.    My grandmother said       (Laughter) I  had been gone from Oklahoma for 21 years. Four in Washington, D.C.  and 17 in Ames, Iowa and a whole generation slipped away. I thought it  23  Nykolaiszyn  Scruggs  Nykolaiszyn  Scruggs  Nykolaiszyn  Scruggs  Nykolaiszyn  Scruggs  Nykolaiszyn  Scruggs  was just hilarious.    My grandmother said to be sure to meet you.     (Laughter) And so we met.  But, it   s interesting. My whole career would have been different. I  taught vocational home economics at Cloud Chief and then at Calumet,  Oklahoma   both Indian names, interestingly enough. And then was in  the state office working with vocational home economics teachers and  then was asked to be National Advisor of Future Homemakers of  America in Washington, D.C. and I was there four years. I had a  bachelor   s and master   s degree by that time and had planned to do  doctoral studies. So after four years, I went to do doctoral study at Iowa  State University and was there 17 years. I say not all as a student.  (Laughter) Then decided I wanted to come back to Oklahoma. So I came  to Oklahoma State. I was Associate Dean at Iowa State and that   s the  position I came to here.  There we go.  But it   s been a privilege to work everywhere I   ve worked. I   ve learned a  lot.  Well, we   ve kind of jumped around a little bit.  Oh, yes.  But is there anything you   d like to add or tell us before we end today?  Anything you   d like to mention?  Well I should have some really profound statement but I don   t. I just  think that I have always been glad that I chose the home economics  profession. It   s a profession that aims to help people and help families  and teaches very practical information for life. And that practical  information is not for just the simple. It   s a profession that I did not need  to retire from; I retired in. You can continue to be the kind of person  you   re trying to be, to serve people. So it   s been a good life   challenges,  yes, but a real good life. I   m grateful.  Well, thank you so much for joining us today. We really appreciate  learning about your life in the    30s and beyond.  Kind of wandered a bit.  Oh that happens.  Good people.  24  Nykolaiszyn  Scruggs  Nykolaiszyn  Absolutely.  All the way through. I should add that over the years people have  learned. People, including me, and we do not have the discrimination  that we used to have, which is appreciated on the part of many people.  Well, thank you again. We do appreciate you.  -------  -------
