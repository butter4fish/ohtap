Speaker 1: What is your favorite food?
Speaker 2: Oh, my favorite food--I like a lot of different foods.  That's a hard one actually.  I like everything almost--probably white cabbage.

Story_ID: 18210
Speaker 1: What can you tell me about your family history?  How far back can we trace your family?
Speaker 2: On my mother's side I can trace it back to Alabama.  My great-grandmother who passed away a few years ago--she's from Alabama.  And that's--she's probably the, the only, the, the, the oldest person I know from my family.  But like my grandmother and them could tell you more about the details of that, but I do know that my mother's side of the family is from Alabama.  And we also like my great-great-grandparents were Indian, part Indian--Native American I should say.  And on my father's side, they're actually developing a--a family tree, so I really don't know much about how far back.  I know my great-grandmother's still alive, and she's from North Carolina.  She's actually still alive, and she lives in North Carolina.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Are there any stories that have passed down through the family about any of your ancestors that, you know, back in slavery days, the Civil War, or right after the Civil War, or during reconstruction or even the first part of this century's civil rights movement or anything?
Speaker 2: No, unfortunately, not.  It seems that a lot of families I--at least anecdotally a lot of families that are from--are planted here up North, the, the roots--we don't have as strong roots as, as a lot of people that are from down South.  And I don't have a lot of those stories.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So a lot of stories get kind of lost--.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --over generations.  Okay, any stories about your grandparents or anything?  Do they have any stories they passed down to you?
Speaker 2: Not really.  I mean, not really.  Just stories like--I mean just like little stuff when they were younger and they used to like, you know, ride on the ice cream trucks and stuff, but nothing like really deep--not really.  Unfortunately--that's, that's unfortunate, though, now that I think about it.  It's really unfortunate that I don't have a lot of those stories.  But my--the--my father's side of the family is in the process of gathering a lot of that information and stuff like that.  And, and since my great-grandmother's still alive, just kind of have her be the storyteller and talking to her about a lot of things.  I don't see her much 'cause she lives in North Carolina.  And I've only actually seen her twice in my life.
Speaker 1: Any of them talk about life during the Depression, during the '30s [1930s] or '40s [1940s]?
Speaker 2: No.  My grandmother was born around that time, so she didn't really have a lot of--she couldn't have a lot of memory of it.  I know my great-grandmother who passed away a few years ago didn't really talk much about that stuff.
Story_ID: 18211
Speaker 1: So your father's name was Alim Bilal born Fred Jones.  When was he born and where was he born?
Speaker 2: Where was he born?  Think he was born in North Carolina. I'm not sure actually.  I think he might have been born in North Carolina.  He moved up here when he was pretty young.  And he was born--let's see, he's twenty years older than me, so he was born in 19--he's October 4, 1953.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I don't know where at in North Carolina he was born.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what was he like and what did he do for a living?
Speaker 2: What does he do, or like, what do you mean, like--?
Speaker 1: Oh, is he, he's still alive?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  My father or my grandfather?
Speaker 1: Your father.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he's a, he's a counselor.  He, he's a drug rehabilitation counselor.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So.
Speaker 1: What's he like?  What kind of life has he had and--?
Speaker 2: Oh, he, he's had a very interesting life.  He, he grew up in Newark [New Jersey] mostly and was a very bright student.  Went to a private school and was very smart.  And went to college up in, in New England--Assumption College for, on a academic scholarship.  And, and his major was physics.  But after his first semester he got homesick.  He came home for the Christmas holiday and didn't go back.  Why--no, he actually went back but didn't stay long.  Like he went back and got in some trouble, and he ended up going back home.  But that Christmas break was like the, a pivotal point in his life where things changed because he wanted to hang out with this friends, and he got caught up in, in, in hanging out with his friends.  And by the time he got back to college in the fall, he wasn't really focused and he's getting in trouble and going back.  But I mean when he went up there he, he had like a B plus average in physics and--but he, it was just like he wanted to be around his friends and then he got homesick.  He, he is a, he's a kind-hearted man--always wants to do things for people, always wants to help make people laugh, smile.  And, and he's a big dreamer--has a lot of ideas and goals and stuff like that.  But when he was younger he got addicted to drugs and that snatched a lot of his dreams away.  And he battled that addiction for, you know, twenty-five, thirty years until he got his life together and, and finally beat the addiction and finally got on the right track and decided to go back to college to get his degree, which he didn't get, you know, twenty, some twenty-five years ago.  He got his degree, and he's still going on and finish up his education and try to get a master's and then a doctorate as well.
Speaker 1: Okay, that seems, that seems like a story--he's a bad story that turned good.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Was he around a lot when you were coming up?
Speaker 2: No, he--I mean he was in the area where I lived, but he wasn't, he wasn't in the home.  I grew up in a single-parent home.  It was just me and my mother [Arlene Hunt].  And he, he--going through the things that he went through as far as, you know, getting in trouble with the law and he was in jail, you know, sometimes and he, you know, his addition was taking him elsewhere.  So he wasn't around a lot.  But when I did see him and when we did hang out and stuff when I was younger, it, it was always a pleasure.  It was always good.  I mean it was like whatever, at least I felt like whatever high he was on or would have been in search of, when I was around it was like, okay, he took a break from that and, and, and spent his time with me and stuff.  But it was, it wasn't frequent, but it was, it was, it was quality time.
Speaker 1: That's good.  Now, when did he become a Muslim?
Speaker 2: He grew up in the era where Malcom X and, and around that time he became a, a Muslim I believe and then--he's not a Muslim anymore.  He's a, he's a Christian now.  But around that time where it, you know, where the Black Panthers and all, all of those other black--civil rights movements--around that time is when he became a Muslim.  And then when the Nation of Islam kind of disbanded, he kind of faded out, but he had changed his name and stuff and so he kept the name.
Speaker 1: So he was in the Nation, in the old Nation of Islam under Elijah Muhammad--.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --in the beginning and then when he died in '74 [1974] the Nation went through a transition with Wallace [D. Muhammad] taking part of it and [Louis] Farrakhan taking another part and I think some other people--.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --he, he got out of it when--.
Speaker 2: He got--I don't know exactly when he, he got out, but it kind of faded out around that time.
Speaker 1: You know, the name Bilal was one of those names--was the name of--.
Speaker 2: It was one of the ninety-nine attributes.  I don't know what it means, though.
Speaker 1: Well, Bilal was the, the ex-slave, the ex- black slave who wrote the, actually wrote the Koran down for Muhammad.
Speaker 2: Oh, okay.  See, I didn't know that.
Speaker 1: Muhammad was inspired and he told the, the writings to Bilal who could write.  Muhammad couldn't write, but he told them to Bilal with the Arabic story from the Koran. And Wallace Muhammad-- (interruption).
Speaker 2: Sorry I didn't get that on tape.
Speaker 1: I grew up in the Nation.  Well--and I thought it was the Nation, but later I realized that it really wasn't the Nation 'cause it was after Elijah Muhammad.
Speaker 2: So they were calling it the World Community of Islam kind of thing under, under Wallace Muhammad.  And he changed the name of the paper from 'Muhammad Speaks' to 'Bilalian News' and then he called it the 'American Mission of Islam' and he changed it about--at least twice.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Yeah, and a lot of stuff--and then, you know, and as it faded out and only, you know, people just, it just changed and with the transition it lost a lot of people, and one the people that it lost was my parents and, and, and so--.
Speaker 2: A lot of the businesses were dissolved and that sort--.
Speaker 1: Yeah. So it's interesting to, to, to hear about a lot of what goes on--I just have vague memories of, of going to the mosque and, you know, being on one side and men and women on different sides.  And this was, again, after Elijah Muhammad with Wallace D. Muhammad.
Speaker 2: So you didn't go in '73 [1973].  You were in--I mean the transition was going on you were very young.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay, now, so he's a drug counselor now and trying to get a higher degree and all that?
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.  He's in school now to get his, his degree.  He's going to stay in that area focusing--he, he, I think that he's found his nitch, his gift, because a lot of--he, he's one of the better counselors that they have at the programs and he, he's, he's been at a lot of different programs.  He's well--he's like sought after a lot so he, he initiates programs at different places and then he goes to--in other places and initiate programs and stuff.  He gives lectures and stuff like that.

Speaker 1: Can you tell us about your mother?  Can you give us her full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Arlene Hunt, A-R-L-E-N-E, Hunt, H-U-N-T.
Speaker 1: And what is her birth date and place of birth?
Speaker 2: All right, that's a little harder.  She was born seventeen years before me, so she was born in--was it '56 [1956] maybe?
Speaker 1: Yeah, '56 I think.
Speaker 2: And she was--and her birthday just passed, which was July 8th, I mean June, June 8th.  And she was probably born in, in Newark, New Jersey.  I really don't know if it was Newark or Orange, but she was born in New Jersey.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, now what was your mother's life like before she had you?
Speaker 2: Her life was--she was a--there was six, I always forget.  Let me see--one, two, Venus, Rahman, Nicole, Shanu.  There were six kids.  She's was one of six kids.  And she was the oldest girl, so she was mostly responsible for rearing, rearing all of her brothers and sisters while my grandmother was out at work.  My grandmother also--she was--my grandmother was married to my grandfather, but they separated for a long time.  So she was really raising all those kids by herself.  And then she got remarried to--well, she wasn't actually married to him, but she had another relationship with my aunt's father.  So there a couple from my grandfather and another couple from my step-grandfather, if you will.  So she was responsible for rearing all of those kids while, while they grew up.  So she was kind of like the big sister to everybody.  And she was the responsible one for everybody.  And she was smart, too.  She always did, did well in school, and she wanted to go to college and do, do a lot of different things but before she got out of high school she met my father and got pregnant with me.  So she was seventeen when she got pregnant--she was still in school.  And so when she got pregnant she ended up having to finish school at night school.  And then she went on to college afterwards, but she, she never finished.  Then she went and got a, a job at like Bell Labs or something and worked there.  And so she, I mean, as, I mean from the stories, I mean she was a very pretty girl.  She was very pretty and a lot of--she, she like one of the best looking in her class and stuff like that.  And she was a cheerleader and all that other stuff.  So she was just like a typical teenager from what I hear.
Story_ID: 18213
Speaker 1: Is there a story about how she [mother Arlene Hunt] and your father [Alim Bilal] met?  Do you have a story about that?
Speaker 2: My father tells me the story.  He--they went to different schools and, you know, he, he, you know, she was this pretty girl from the school.  And I don't know exactly how they met, but he wanted to talk to her because, you know, she was this pretty girl.  She was a cheerleader.  And the interesting part about it is that I have a sister who's the exact same age as me but eighteen days younger.  And her mother was another cheerleader from a different school.  So he was dating both my mother and her mother at the same time.  And, and they knew about each other.  And, you know, they--it was--I, I--.  They never really told me the details of it--I don't know if they were embarrassed or they just didn't want to tell me, but I don't know what it was, but it would--and they were--they knew each other--they were friends.  I--it was just weird.  And they were--I, I think--I don't think they knew about each other in the beginning, but after they, he, they found out they both were pregnant, and, and it was his, they were his babies.  So instead of cat fighting, they, they formed a friendship.  So I mean they would be over his house--both of them, pregnant (laughter) at the same time.  And so I thought that was kind of interesting.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And they never, they never developed a relationship much after that.  Like they didn't, they didn't get together after that.  I think that he probably stayed with my sister's mother for a little while after that and then they broke up, too.
Story_ID: 18214
Speaker 1: Was your mother ever a member of the Nation of Islam, too?  Was she--?
Speaker 2: Yes, well, she was in--she was a Muslim.  She was with--during that transition as well in the Nation, yeah--under Wallace [D. Muhammad] probably because it around the time I was born or and shortly after that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So she was--.
Speaker 2: And her name was Ameena.  I don't know what, I don't know what, what last name she had but that was her--maybe Ameena Shabazz--yeah, that's what it was.  She didn't use it.
Speaker 1: But were your grandparents in the Nation?
Speaker 2: No, everybody was like Baptist or something that--mostly Baptist.
Speaker 1: But she was like--different from other people in her family .
Speaker 2: Yeah it was--well, mostly the kids, most of my grandmother kids adopted the Nation.  My--both my uncles and my mother and then my other--my--the three other aunts, they didn't adopt the Nation.  They stayed in the church.  And my, one of my other uncles didn't adopt the Nation.
Story_ID: 18215
Speaker 1: You were raised from what I understand primarily by your grandmother.
Speaker 2: My mother [Arlene Hunt] and my grandmother.  Like my mother raised me for the most part in general.  My grandmother filled in the gaps a lot of the times when my mother, when we lost a house or when my mother, when things were going bad in her life, I'd go live with my grandmother.  So my grandmother filled in the gaps a lot of times and oftentimes we lived with my grandmother.  But in, in my younger years, I mostly lived with my, with my mother.  And a lot of the values that were instilled in me I got from my mother.  So, it was a dual kind of thing.  But I always looked at my grandmother as my mother, too.  She was like my second mother if anything.  And sometimes she was also, she was like my first mother.  And it got to a point where when I was thirteen I, I hadn't lived, I didn't live with my mother anymore from thirteen on I, I didn't live with my mother anymore.  It was--I lived with my grandmother, I lived with my other grandmother, I lived with my uncle, I kind of moved around a lot.
Story_ID: 18216
Speaker 1: Tell me about growing up.  What, what neighborhood did you grow up or did you move--you moved around a lot right? Yeah.
Speaker 2: I moved around a lot.  I'm--I lived--I was born in Orange [New Jersey] and I--we lived in Newark for a while, then I moved to Plainfield [New Jersey], then I moved back to Newark.  But while I was in Plainfield, I, I spent my elementary school years in Plainfield.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, and it--even in Plainfield I moved around a lot.  I, I went to a different elementary school every year of my elementary school years up until I got to seventh grade, except for one year I think third or fourth grade, maybe third and fourth grade I went to the same school 'cause I went to--no, fourth and--yeah, third and fourth grade I think it was I went to a Catholic school for two years.  And then after that I went back to a public school and I went to a different public school after that then went to another public school after that.  So I moved around a lot, but it was okay with me.  I mean I was able to make friends for the most part.  I didn't realize it 'til later on in life tha it could have--it posed challenges, but I, I didn't see it back then.  You know, it just kind of getting to know friends 'cause I was able to get over that hump, but it was just always challenging to always start a new school year meeting new people.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's got to be a challenge, you know, for a kid that's constantly starting a new school, you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and, and, and the work was different, too, because I was a pretty bright kid so if--like the schools were always on different levels.  And so if the work was a little harder, it was easy for me to catch up 'cause I was a quick learner.  But there were times when the work was not so--they were behind the school I had been in before.  So it wasn't challenging at all.  And I was a real hyper kid so I'd get in trouble a lot.  Not be--not getting like mischievous trouble--I'd just talk, I'd talk a lot.  And teachers would, you know, try to get me to stop talking, and I wouldn't.  And I--I remember one time--it was interesting--I went to Catholic school and they were about a year behind this public school.  And that was weird because, you know, you'd have thought a Catholic school would have been, but it wasn't.  And so all of the work that they would give me I had learned those things a year before.  So it was really difficult for me and I would--that--all I did was getting in--just talking and playing, you know, draw and all kinds of stuff because I would get (snaps fingers) my work done like, like that.  And, you know, and the teacher recommended that I go to special education because I was a behavior problem.  And, luckily, my mother [Arlene Hunt] was like, what are you talking about?  He has straight A's.  And how can you send him to special ed?  But she was like, well, he's, he's disruptive to the class and da da da da.  And she's like, well, give him more work.  So, she, she kept me out of special ed because of that.
Speaker 1: Now, that raises an interesting problem with educators that discuss in the black community where kids because of a behavior problem they're placed in special education--.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: --which is, you know, something that doesn't seem to happen in white schools that much.  You know, special ed are really people that are slow--.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --rather than people that are--.
Speaker 2: And, and, and that's the reason why it's--the system is, is tragically flawed because you can't--they're not one and the same and you can't do that.  I mean you, if you were to, if I would have been put in special ed, my behavior would have got worse because the work would have been even (laughter) slower, like it would have been terrible.  Like and then they would have put me on Ritalin, and it would have been (laughter), it would have just been like a, a downward spiral.  But, unfortunately, there are people out there that have had, that had that experience because their parents, you know, weren't strong enough to say no, you know, or, or sit down with me and explain to me why it is that you think my child needs to be in, you know, and, and give me the alternatives and all that other stuff.  A lot of parents think that, you know, okay, well, teacher--that's the professional and that's their recommendation--okay I'm a go with it, you know.  And, and, unfortunately, you know, the teachers--they don't really have an alternative.  They really need just to, they need to teach a whole class.  And it's just one disruptive person.  And, yeah, maybe he does have great grades, but he's disrupting the other class.  So what do you do?  You put him in the special ed.  But that's doing that child a disservice.  And, again, the, the system is flawed.  It should be, if anything, you should, you should--if, if there's behavior problems, first what we need is identify why there are behavior problems.  In my case it was because I was bored.  So then you need to either put me in an advance class or you need to give me more work like my mother suggested, suggested or something.  And if there is just a behavior problem--that this child is at or, you know, at par or whatever, then you need to maybe d-, you know, have a section or something of the class where you could have somebody focus on those behavior problems as opposed to slowing him down academically 'cause that's, that's not going to help the child.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: A lot of times we try to put Band-Aids on things as opposed to just kind of fixing things.
Speaker 1: That's actually worse than a Band-Aid.  That would have--I mean you were--.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Yeah.
Speaker 1: Did you consider yourself lucky that you had a mother that--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  I mean I--because had she not had the wherewithal to say, no, this will not happen.  I mean it, you know, it, it would have been tragic.  It would have been--I mean I would have never been able to obtain the things that I've obtained in life.  And it would have--and the thing would have been it would have been hard to explain.  You'd be like, well, why is, is, does he have such a bad behavior?  And it, you know, it would have been something that happened in the, you know, fourth grade that now I'm, you know, in the eighth, ninth grade and they might not have connected the two and like, oh, he's just a bad behavior problems, getting in trouble, he's doing this, he's doing that--not knowing that it all stemmed from, you know, me being placed in special ed and, and, and not stimulating my mind, and so me trying to stimulate my own mind by doing other things.  So it would have been tragic.
Story_ID: 18217
Speaker 1: We go back a little bit and maybe to this life in the neighborhood and what were the, some of the sights and sounds and smells of the neighborhood you grew up in and life around home?
Speaker 2: Home is--I love home.  Home is home.  But home has its, you know, it's, it's like the jungle.  It's like the belly of the beast.  And you go outside and, you know, it's like people selling drugs on the corner.  It's, you know--and like, like where I lived there was a basketball court so a lot of people would hang out on the basketball court, people, you know, drinking their beer bottles and smoking their cigarettes.  And back then people used to smoke joints and you'd see the reefer paper, the Easy Rider reefer paper all around.  And I'm, you know, I might have been I don't know--but those types of memories I might have been like, you know, eight, nine years old.  And, you know, it was just--and older guys, fourteen, fifteen, you know, used to be behind the school, you know, being, trying to be cool and, you know, little--you got street crews.  They weren't really--see now they are--we got gangs.  But back then it wasn't really gangs, it was just, you know, people that lived around each other would, you know, that, that's your crew--those the people you hung out with and it wasn't really a gang.  And the people two blocks down had their own little crew.  So we used, you know--you had your little crew and you'd hang out with them and people got in little trouble when they got little brawls with each other.  And it really wasn't about guns at the time--like at most it was a fistfight.  The, the biggest thing might have been a knife or something.  And--but it was a lot of hopelessness and despair in the community because you didn't see many professionals in our community.  You didn't see doctors, lawyers, you know, or anything--we didn't even see teachers actually.  You know, your teachers came to the, to your area to teach, but they--you didn't know--you know, most of them didn't live next door to you.  You know, most--the, the, the best jobs in my community were civil service jobs.  And, and so I thought my family was doing it because, you know, most people in my family worked at the post office.  So it was like, oh, we, we're rich!  And, and, unfortunately, that's the height that you, that you try to obtain because that's the height that you know.  You think that that is the pinnacle--that is what, what, what success is.
Story_ID: 18218
Speaker 1: You didn't have a lot of teachers and lawyers and doctors in the neighborhood and--.  So, you know, people--a level that they tried to reach and obtain was really just what they, they saw in the neighborhood.  And so it, it--people didn't really have a lot of hopes and dreams and aspirations, you know, at, at least as they got older.  I mean when you were younger everybody, you know, had big dreams.  And I remember when I was like in, you know, second grade or, or so and the teacher would ask what is it that you want to be when you get older.  Everybody, you know, had these big dreams--I want to be astronaut, I want to be a lawyer, I want to be this, want to be that.  But as they got older and they started to recognize and realize the, the reality of their communities, those dreams kind of vanished.  And the hope that they had and, and all those aspirations kind of went out the window and--.
Speaker 2: What, you know, what did you want to be when you were that age?
Speaker 1: I wanted to be all of that.  I mean I remember I wanted, I thought I wanted to be the president, I thought I wanted to be a policeman, a fireman, you know.  I had about four or five different goals myself.  And as I got older those dreams kind of went away.  And then I didn't know what I wanted to be after that.  I was just--and that's like most of my other friends.  They didn't know what they wanted to be.  And I was kind of lost.  I just, just--I didn't have any direction or any goals to--.  It was just, just go to school and do--you know, I--it, it was just like that.
Story_ID: 18219
Speaker 1: And it wasn't until--I found a purpose when I got in high school.  I started to work with other kids in the school to try to get African American studies in the high school because it--as a, as a requirement because it wasn't a requirement.  And I--and this is by the time--by that time moved, moved back to Newark [New Jersey].  And it wasn't a requirement in the, in the Newark school system and--.
Speaker 2: Now, and what high school was this?
Speaker 1: University High School.  And you gotta, you know, realize that, you know, like in Newark the majority of the population were African Americans and Latinos and yet neither subject was a requirement, but U.S. history was and, you know, American history and all these other histories were except for the history that, that, that we had in this country or Latinos had in this country.  And so it was--we banded together and we decided to make it a issue and bring it up and, and it, it got me, it, it sparked some fire back into, into me, me wanting to do things and me wanting to be progressive and me wanting to do something positive.  And then it started me to want to help people.  Then I got on this kick in high school that I--that's what I want to do.  I want to help people and--.
Speaker 2: How old were you when you got involved in the black history movement?
Speaker 1: We, we were about, I was like fifteen, sixteen.  It was me--it was started with me and a couple of my high school friends.  And two of my high school friends happened to be Amiri Baraka's sons.  And, and so they obviously had a--their family had a lot of history in, in, in, you know, progression for black people.  So--and we had a lot of intellectual debates.  And it--it reinvigorated me, again, because we--I really was able to stimulate my mind again, which, which was almost asleep.  It was just kind of me going to school, going through the routine.  But it wasn't until that moment in my life that I, I got it reinvigorated again.  And that's when I decided that I wanted to be a teacher because I thought what better way to effect change in the community than to reach our youth.
Speaker 2: Okay, now, now were you successful in getting a black history instituted?
Speaker 1: We, we had, we had sit-ins, we had, we actually went down to the Board of Education.  First we, first of all, we shut down downtown.  We went into the main--Broad [Street] and Market [Street] is the main thoroughfare--it's like the center of downtown Newark.  And we shut it down.  We made a, a human, human roadblock and then we went to the Board of Education and shut that down.  And so we were successful.  We had a limited success because they, they offered it, but it still wasn't a requirement.  But at least it was offered because it wasn't really offered before we--and they gave, they gave--I mean they had like one class that you could, that you could take which was--it was difficult because it never jived with any of your other required classes.  But they made it more accessible.  So it was successful--it had a limited success.  But then after we left and after, you know, the, the, the people that were very adamant about it left it kind of fizzled.  And I actually don't know where it stands.  I'm--I'm almost sure that it's not a requirement still, but it is offered.  And, and actually as a result of that we hired, they recruited and hired a African American studies teacher.  But then they couple of years later let her go, but it did, it did make a change, at least if, if not, if only for a limited amount of time, it did make a change.  And it showed that, that you could do it if you really had a concerted effort to a goal.
Speaker 2: Okay, now did you have--was there a mentor for your, your group or was it just all students?
Speaker 1: It was all students.  We all just banded together and decided to, to--first we started with our school and then we realized that in order to, to really, you know, make a difference we had to get other students from other schools.  And so we went and talked to other students, and we, and we, and we did a rally where we got, we had everybody just leave school and, and go downstairs--and go downtown and protest in front of City Hall.  And then from that protest we started an organization called the United Student Organization.  And so--and we had meetings like, you know, once a week down at the library downtown Newark.  And, and, you know, you know, we were the heads of the organization trying to organize it, figure out how to plan and, and get our issues on the table in front of the mayor, in front of the Board of Education, that kind of stuff.  Most--in the, in the newspapers they would say--'cause the newspapers covered a lot of the stuff that we did, but they would say, oh, you know, these, these kids are, are--like Amiri Baraka is, is kind of leading these guys, but it, it was never--I mean I can tell you it was never that.  I mean I'm quite sure that his, his sons had--he influenced his sons, but they weren't the only ones that were involved in the leadership of the, of the, of the organization.  And, and, and they had minds of their own.

Speaker 1: Of the three doctors in--who we've interviewed, of you three young doctors, you're the only one that's got a political kind of story, you know, (unclear).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Now when did you meet George and--?
Speaker 2: Ninth grade in high school.  See I, I, yeah, I was--I met Sam [Sampson Davis] and George [Jenkins] in ninth grade of high school.  I was in, placed into the advanced placement classes.  And they were also in there.  So we met just by default because we were classmates.  And all of our classes were the same.  Like we, we had every single class--all eight periods were, were pretty much the same.  And so we just, we met each other that way and we, we had a initial bond because we realized that we had a lot of similarities--like we liked to get our work done, but we also liked to have fun.  We liked to hang out and stuff like that.  And so it, it, it started that way.  And so our friendship just developed over time.  That--and Sam and George had already known each other 'cause they, they had met in the seventh grade two years before I came along.  And at, at--'cause University High School actually started in seventh grade.  They had like a junior high school component.  And so it went from there.  And it, it just kind of grew over time.  And, I mean, actually, in high school before--I mean I always knew Sam and George, but they weren't my best friends initially.  My best friends were Ahi Baraka and this guy named Hassan Abdu Sebord (ph.), and we were like the three amigos initially.  And me and Sam and George were very, very cool, but I hung out with them a little more.  Me and Sam were, were a--just got closer as we got older because me and Sam had jobs.  We were probably one of the couple of guys in the--and then George did get a job, too.  One of the, the couple of guys who actually went out there and got a job and tried to get some money in their pocket and me and Sam were the first two people to get cars at the high school and so me and him hung out more.  And as the years went on we got a lot closer because we, we did a lot of same things.  We liked to go out to parties, you know.  We liked to, you know, liked the girls and all of that other stuff.  So we, we got a lot closer as years went on.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now I'm just thinking that that's not unlike a lot of young (laughter) what things that you all say you had in common.  But the most unique thing might be the study habits, you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and I think that is, that is the study habits were unique and what really bonded us because Ahi and Hassan weren't in the same classes I wa-, I was in.  Even though we, we were friends, we had totally different classes and we had different study habits.  And so as time went on me, Sam, and George were a lot closer.  And Ahi and Hassan--our relationship was still close but it, it, it was like I was in the middle.  Like I was really cool with Sam and George and also really cool with Ahi and Hassan.  And, and the, and actually the, the crossroad came when it was time to think about going to college.  And, initially, I wanted to go to Howard [University] along with Ahi and Hassan (interruption).
Speaker 1: Now you were an honor student in high school?
Speaker 2: When I first started high school I was a honor student.  But then I wanted to hang out more.  And so I just--and I--and high school was pretty easy so I realized I could just get by and be fine.  So I didn't really do any-, try to excel academically like I used to.
Speaker 1: Now you were taking honors courses, right, so you're on another track.  And it was still kind of easy--you know what I'm saying?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  It, it wasn't, it wasn't hard at all.  I mean it just wasn't hard.  This, this school that I went to was actually a college preparatory school but I--it just wasn't as challenging as I would have, would have expected it to be.  And it's unfortunate, but it, it just wasn't--I mean it probably would have been, I mean if I had to compare it, it probably would have been compared to just a regular public school in your, you know, average suburban community.  But in Newark in the inner city that was like the echelon of, of, of public schools.  And it, it just, it wasn't really that challenging.  I mean when I first got there I was getting straight A's, B's.  And then after I kind of met people and, and realized it wasn't that hard I, I kind of slacked off and it was--I was okay with C's and B's.  So it was--and, and I got by with C's and B's without not really doing much work at all.  So I, I was like oh, that's cool--'cause, again, it wasn't like I really had a goal or direction.  And it wasn't until I actually went to college that I refocused again and started getting straight A's again.
Story_ID: 18221
Speaker 1: Now, your two friends have told us the story of how they first decided they were going to be. Well George [Jenkins] always wanted to be a dentist from the time a dentist showed him how, what a dentist was about--what being a dentist was about. But there was someone who came to school to speak.  They tell a story about a you all going to hear this speaker talk about careers in medicine?
Speaker 2: It was a, it was a story about careers in--it was a, a person, a recruiter from Seton Hall University who came to speak to us about careers in medicine.  And we all probably tell different stories in a way.  I mean it was the same story, but we tell it differently.  We had a class, and I think you could either go to a class or go to the seminar.  So, it was I think a substitute teacher, and we decided to tell the teacher we're gonna go to the seminar, but we really had no plans of going to the seminar.  We were going to the gym or somewhere to go play basketball.  And as we were, as we were cutting class in a way--but as we were cutting class, the, there was security and, that was in the hall.  So we kind of, instead of--we didn't want to get caught by security, so we just kind of ducked into the library.  And as the seminar started and I'm sitting in the back and I'm listening and--they're talking about careers in medicine--and, and in--mind you I was, at that point I had already decided that, you know, I wanted to do something to help young people and I wanted to do something to give back to the community and, and, and I just wasn't sure what it was.  And so I figured being a teacher is what it was.  But when I listened to that lady talk about careers in medicine--first time I ever thought about becoming a doctor.  And, and when I sat and I listened and I said that's it!  Like that--the light bulb went on--like that's it.  You help people.  You, you teach, as well.  You teach your patients.  You, you know--I mean I'm a teacher now.  I'm a clinical assistant professor of medicine--like you, you teach and, and you make a good living.  So I was like this is--that's it.  And so I, I sat and, and that's when the world started to spin.  But there was like a, a, a problem because I had already decided that I wanted to go down to Howard with my other two friends doing what I wanted to do, what I wanted to major in, but I just wanted to be with my boys kind of thing.  So I was not really sure which way I wanted to go.  And George was like, you know, hey, you know, let's go and do this together.  And, and then I was like well these my boys, too, so I could still have fun.  So I had two options.  One, go to Howard, one, go to Seton Hall, and both of them were pretty good options.  At one I had more of a direction because it was becoming a doctor, so I started to lean more to that.  But then I wanted to go on to experience that historically black college kind of scene and environment 'cause I, I thought that it could nurture me and, and, and, and I could really get a good experience down there and have fun.  So, I had actually sent in all of the stuff for Howard and got my room assignment, but I couldn't afford to go there.  The--they weren't gonna give me any state money, so I had to make a decision.  And I decided to go to Seton Hall with my other two friends.  And, and, and that started it from there.  And that was probably the best decision I made--one that, well, I'm--there were so many good decisions, like pivotal decisions in my life, but that was definitely one of them because had I--my other two friends came back.  They didn't--they, they, they kind of flunked out.  You know, they were having a good time and, and, and I would have been doing exactly the same thing they would have been doing.  So I--if they came back, I probably would have came back, too.
Story_ID: 18222
Speaker 1: Now you had another brush with disaster from what I've read.  It was an incident where you were--you had an incident with a crackhead, you and some other guys, and you end up in jail?  Is that correct?
Speaker 2: Yeah, 'cause when I was fifteen, sixteen years old, I, I had another group of friends.  I had a couple of sets of friends.  And I was always a loyal friend--kind of like I always stuck by my friends.  And I have friends from my old neighborhood of Plainfield [New Jersey]--and mind you I had moved on and moved to Newark and--but I still had these friends in Plainfield, so I would still periodically come out and hang out with them.  And, and there were times I had to move back to Plainfield because I was no longer living with my mother [Arlene Hunt] and when I couldn't live with my uncle anymore, I had to move back to Plainfield.  So sometimes I had to catch the bus to Newark and--.  So I was hanging out with my friends one day and we were hanging out in our little spot behind the school, and a crackhead came behind the school and, and was looking for some crack.  And I'm not--don't remember the particulars.  I don't know if somebody that I was with either sold it to him--I'm assuming that somebody sold it to him because he came and asked for some crack.  And then he, he--yeah, 'cause the guy was--he did sell it to him because he said--the whole thing was, okay, he'll sell him the crack, but don't smoke it behind the school.  So, he bought it, and the guy left, and we continued about our business.  Now, you know, there were--were drinking beer behind the school, you know, and somebody looked over, over in the distance and saw a, a, like a orange flame.  This guy had like a, a torch, like a lighter, which real, you know, turned up real high.  And it was, he was, you know, smoking his crack, and you could see it behind the green dumpster behind the school.  And so, you know, we're big and bad--we got our little crew.  And so everybody was like, well, you know, we told him not to smoke this crack back here, you know.  There are kids that come back here and, you know, how dare he.  Mind you, he sold it sold it to him (laughter) back there, but, yet, now we want to get all righteous.  You know, it's funny how things like that work out.  So we're like, you know, so we thought--and plus, well, we thought we were big and bad and how dare he disobey us.  So we, you know--.
Speaker 1: Somebody's lower on the totem pole and, you know--.
Speaker 2: It was--this guy was actually a lifeguard who, who before he got strung out on crack was pretty well respected in the neighborhood.  But he was a crackhead now.  So, you know, and he was older than us.  So we put, you know, we got to put what, put that stuff down and walked over there.  And one of my friends, you know, said to him, "Hey, I told you to stop smoking crack," you know, pushed him like, get out of here!  And he said, "Okay, okay, okay," and he looked around and, and his, you know, he was so, you know, so addicted and need that fix, he, he, even though he said, "okay, okay," he lit the crackpipe again.  And he said, "What did I tell you?"  He said, "Okay, okay"--lit it again.  And my friend hit him, and he fell, and the crackpipe shattered.  And everybody was like, whoa, you know, and then the adrenaline in everybody started to rush.  And the guy got back up and my friend hit him again, and he got back up and his--and, you know, like, oh, look, you know, you knocked him out.  And see, like in our communities it was like you, that was like a badge of honor that you beat somebody up--like it was like, oh, you big and you bad and you tough.  And you need to have those survival mechanisms in our school and our, in our communities because you had to be big and bad and tough or you wouldn't survive.  You couldn't be a punk and actually be out on the street and interact and, and, and, and have an, a relationship with people of, of your peers.  You couldn't have a relationship with your peers because otherwise, if you a punk, they, they wouldn't, first of all, accept you as a peer.  And you couldn't really just, you couldn't be--have fun, be a friend, you couldn't do anything because they wouldn't accept you.  And so you had to be, you--they pick on you, you had to be, you had to be tough in order to be accepted.  And everybody wanted to be accepted and everybody wanted to have friends and everybody wanted to hang out and have fun and stuff.  So that was a badge of honor.  He could go back and say, oh, I beat, I knocked somebody out.  That was a good thing, unfortunately.  So, somebody else say, hey, well, let me see if I can do it.  So somebody else hit him--boom!  Knocked him down.  So now everybody's like, oh, well let me get a try--picked him up, hit him again, knocked him down.  So everybody commenced to beat this guy up including myself.  And, and I'm looking like it's almost like I'm watching a movie 'cause I'm not really a part of it but I am a part of it.  And, and I, like I really wasn't that kind of guy, but I really did want to be accepted.  And a lot of it was because I didn't have a male figure in my home.  And I didn't know how to be a man.  I didn't know the lessons on becoming a man.  I didn't know how to walk, talk.  I didn't know how to, you know, what I should be doing.  And so I lived with a bunch of women--like it was just my mother [Arlene Hunt] and, if I wasn't living with my mother and I lived with my grandmother, it was all my aunts.  So it was always women around me but there never were any men that I could learn lessons from.  So I went out on the street and learned how to become a man.  So I would pick people--I remember picking people and deciding, oh, I want to be like him today and, and, and try to learn his mannerisms and learn how to be a man from him.  And, and so I--that's how I started to learn my manhood.  And, and so getting back to the story--when I was, when I was there, it was like, well, you know, I need to be tough like these guys 'cause that's what it's about.  And even though in my heart it was like I just--it was a pit in my stomach, but it was like, well, oh, this is what you're supposed to do.  And that's why I was never really the leader (laughter) of, of my little crew because I didn't have those leader qualities as far as--'cause I couldn't be as ruthless and as bad and as tough as they were.  But, oh, well.  So I hit him, too.  And then I had just gotten a knife from my uncle--had a shop that--and, and he sold me a switchblade.  And so I had it on me.  It just so happened I had it on me.  So I figured I could, you know, earn some respect today and people would be like, wow, look at him.  So I pulled the knife out and said, "Look, look what I have."  And I pressed the button and the knife popped up and they were like wow.  And I got the response and the reaction that I wanted but then they wanted me to use it.  And so then I got scared again and I said, oops, I made a boo-boo--I should have never pulled the knife out.  But I couldn't put it back or at least I thought I couldn't put it back because, if I had a put it back, they would have called me wimp, a punk, all of this.  And so the peer pressure was on, and it was, and it was too much for me to deal with.  I--so I decided to use it because I figured I had to figure out how to use it 'cause I wasn't going to really stab this guy.  So, I took the knife and I poked him in his thigh and tried to make some sound effects like "ah, ah," like that and then, and then I quickly retracted the blade and put it in my pocket.  And it wasn't--so, it was fine.  And I got the respect that I thought I wanted and, and we went about our business.  We left, we left, we left him there, and we left.  Everybody went home except three of us.  Three of us came back to the school.  We went to the store and then we came back to the school to hang out some more.  There were police officers waiting for us when we got back there and we got arrested.  So, and that was the biggest turning point in my life.  If I had to pick one moment, I would say that because I never gotten arrested before, never really ever been in trouble before.  But, but this was serious.  And the cop at the time was playing with the switchblade.  He was like, "Wow, I wish I would a caught you before he went and press charges.  I would have just took the knife from you.  'Cause, look, now I gotta submit this knife for evidence, and I wish I coulda kept it.  It's a cool knife."  And he was teasing us and all that kind of stuff.  And, you know, when I got to jail and I woke up the next morning, I thought I was in my bed and I thought I had had a bad dream.  And I woke up and said, whew, I had a bad dream and, and I opened my eyes and I looked around and I realized it wasn't a bad dream--it was reality and I was in jail.  And that--I was only in jail for, I mean, five or six days in the juvenile detention center.  But that's all I needed to, to learn--I mean one day is too long.  And so and, but, and, and I--when I got out I was like never again.  And I made sure I hung around Sam [Sampson Davis] and George [Jenkins] a lot more and, and we started to learn our manhood from each other 'cause none of us had, had fathers at home, but we started to learn our manhood from each other and started to look within and started to grow from there.  And I just knew I didn't want to go back because a lot of those young guys that were in there were resigned to that lifestyle.  It, it didn't bother them that they were in jail.  It just didn't.  It's--I mean, hey, and their, all their brothers went to jail, their fathers went to jail, you know.  And it was almost a rite of passage.  You would come home and say, hey, I just did a such-and--two-year bid or--that was like a rite of passage almost.  And it's unfortunate that in our communities a lot of these negative things are, you know, are celebrated almost.  And that's one of the things we want to change.  We want to let people know that, that it's really, that's not really the way and to kind of dismay a lot of these myths and change a lot of things because we've been through a lot and we understand what a lot of these young people are going through and, and how impressionable their minds are and how it's easy to go down the wrong track when you're so young.  It's very, very easy to go down the wrong track and you need somebody in, in there.  You, you need a role model.
Story_ID: 18223
Speaker 1: And you know, this is 2003 and our young people are involved in gangs on the East Coast.  And I remember when I was--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Midwest, too.
Speaker 1: Huh?
Speaker 2: Midwest and the West--.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and I would--but, but, but I remember the--the interesting part is I remember we didn't have gangs on the East Coast.  That's--we never had them.  And I remember when I was growing up and listening to, to rap groups lake NWA and they're talking about colors and, and Ice-T and--that was a West Coast thing.  And we would sit and laugh like they're so stupid--they're fighting over colors and da da da da.  And somehow it migrated here.  And it shows you that, you know, our young people need role models.  They need somebody to look up to.  They need direction.  They need alternatives because there are no alternatives.  When you grow up in the hood, your alternative is whatever's in front of you.  You could either do it with a knife or a gun.  Like you, you know, a lot of people get into a lot of bad things from all walks of life.  It's just the--what, what are those, the options for the bad things.  Like if you're from a suburban community, your options for doing something bad might just be, I don't know, you know, throwing a egg at somebody's car or something like that.  Those are the, those are the options that are out there.  This is what the young people do--whatever it is.  But it's, it's, it's real minor compared to what the options you have in the hood because the options you have in the hood is, you know, initiation to get in a gang is to kill somebody or beat somebody up real bad or steal a car or to rob a store.  Those are the options that you have to be mischievous in the hood.  It's not throwing a egg at a car, it's not whatever.  The options are much different and all, both parties have those options, but they're just different options.  And we, we need to combat that.  We need to do something to change that.  And, and that's what we're trying to do--me and my friends [George Jenkins and Sampson Davis] and with our foundation [Three Doctors Foundation, Inc.] and with our mission and with our book, 'The Pact', and with the other books that we're gonna be writing and with, with us, you know, us going around the nation and speaking to try to change a lot of these things.
Story_ID: 18224
Speaker 1: When I was in the juvenile detention center, I, you know, I, I was taking a lot of stuff in.  I realized that the young, the young people in there were resigned to, to, to that lifestyle and what was going on and it wasn't a big deal, too, that they were in jail.  And I actually tried to, to make it seem like it wasn't a big deal either, you know, and--'cause, again, I'm try to learn that manhood, trying to learn how to be like I'm supposed to be.  But, you know, God had another plan, and he gave me another example.  And one day we were, we were playing cards or something and, and it was a ritual to go to the window around 2:30 or whatever because they knew the, the young high school girls were walking by.  And the, and the girls would walk by and always--we were in like a highrise and the girls would always walk by and yell up to us and say a lot of nasty stuff and--because they knew we weren't coming out there, you know.  And so they could say whatever they wanted to say and, and they would entertain us, and, oh, I'm a, whatever, whatever, and fresh things.  And so I was at the window one day looking down and, you know, the girls were saying stuff and the guys were yelling stuff back and it was exciting and everybody's adrenaline was pumping.  And I was looking and I was observing the, the environment.  I looked at the McDonald's across the street and I looked at, you know, the clothing store and I saw people coming in and out and laughing and joking and, and I thought to--and, and I saw the girls down there and I thought to myself, you know, I can't go to that McDonald's right now if I wanted to.  I can't go to that store and buy me a pair of sneakers.  I can't talk to these girls that are talking to us right now.  And that was the moment I realized I was not free and I was in jail.  And I kind of took a step back from the window and, and took it all in and, again, said to myself, you know, never again--I'll never be back here again.  And I prayed to God and asked God that if he got me out of this situation, he wouldn't have to worry about me ever again.
Speaker 2: So when you got out of that you, you were--.
Speaker 1: Yeah, when I, when I got out, when I got out of that situation I, again, I latched on to my friends and, and got focused and, you know, got myself prepared for college and start getting better grades in school.  I still was slipping--I mean I wasn't a--it didn't turn me into a instant saint, obviously, but it, it got me refocused and I stopped hanging with, with those guys as much because they were getting me in trouble, and I didn't want to--.
Speaker 2: You were saying off-camera while we were changing tapes that you had a--you could tell people that you were in jail for attempted murder.
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, and, and like, like and when I got out of jail, I mean it was, it was, it was a bad thing.  But where I came from it really wasn't a bad thing to go to jail and get charged what I got charged with 'cause I talked about it being like almost a rites of passage.  And, and on the streets it was rough.  People would always--they would try you daily.  And it was almost a good thing that I got locked up for attempted murder 'cause I could tell people, hey, you know, I got locked up for attempted murder.  And they, they'd be scared.  You know, they, you know, and, and like, you know, word would get around like, oh, you don't mess with that guy--he got locked up for attempted murder, you know, even though, you know, I was only in there for a couple days and, and really didn't try to kill anybody.  And I--and, you know, and I probably was the punkest person in the jail and just, you know--but it, it protected me.  Nobody would mess with me after that.

Speaker 1: Now when you graduated from high school then you were on your way to Seton Hall [University] pretty much.  You had pretty much just determined to Seton Hall (unclear).
Speaker 2: Yeah, once I, once I realized that I couldn't afford to go to Howard [University] and that this program [minority pre-med scholarship, Seton Hall University] was probably the best for me and I made this pledge to Sam [Sampson Davis] and George [Jenkins] that we were gonna do this, I kind of just focused.  And the things that I had been through as far as with getting arrested before and, and, you know, just, just my life, I refocused and, again, I got re-energized because when I got to the summer program--they had a program in the summer prior to enrolling in the fall.  And that--that program was designed to try to bring you up to speed to, with the other, other freshmen that were entering in the fall.  And I didn't realize the significance of it at the time.  It was like, oh God, I'm a waste my whole summer in this summer program.  Everybody else is going, you know, to the beach, great adventures, wherever, and I gotta be in this summer program.  And it was a rigorous six weeks because you got up at the crack of dawn and you went straight through studying or, or your tutoring or whatever until ten o'clock at night and then it was lights out--every day for six weeks.  And I was like why did I sign up for this.  But it really got me in shape.  It really got me where I needed to be because--and, and they understood it because, you know, this, this program was designed to help.  Because if, had I not took and, you know, been in that program when I would have started in the fall, I wouldn't have been able to compete with my, with my colleagues from, you know, from the suburbs.  I just wouldn't have been able to compete.  The public school that I went to didn't equip me with the, the right tools that I needed in order to compete.  And all it took me was a six-week program to compete 'cause it got me refocused.  It, it taught me like basic study skills and basic things that I needed in order to excel.  And, and that--and we were off, we were off--and then we had each other so it was, it was a, a positive reinforcement.  And so, you know, if one of us got a A, the other one wanted to get a A.  And the person that got a A would try to help to show the other two how to get a A 'cause it was about--it was competition, but it was a healthy competition.  It wasn't a competition where I wanted to do better than you.  It was a competition where I wanted to get a A, but I also wanted you to get a A 'cause I didn't want to be the only one with a A 'cause it would, it would--it was lonely.  I didn't want to be the only one and, and vice--and all of us felt that way.  So we all wanted--so we could all brag together, we didn't want to be, we didn't want to outdo one another.  We all wanted to succeed together.  We wanted to take that step forward together, each of us.  And, and it wasn't like that was even planned.  It was just--it was kind of a unsaid thing.  It was just what we--how the friendship that we developed.  And that, that's what it was about.  It was about that positive peer pressure.  And so we, you know, there's a negative and a positive peer pressure.  And we used the positive side to, to help propel us as opposed to the negative side that most oftentime happens in our communities.

Speaker 1: Were there any teachers or any other adults that like encouraged you along the way, you know, or was it just primarily your friends?
Speaker 2: It was primarily my friends.  A lot of teachers discouraged me.  But there was one teacher who wasn't really my teacher.  She was--I was in the gifted and talented program, and she was one of the--the coordinator for the program.  And she was very, very helpful in motivating me.  I mean this was back in the eighth grade, but I remember her.  She would say just a lot of positive things to me, and I really felt that she felt that way.  Like, you know, a lot of times people say, oh, you're such a nice kid or you're such a smart kid or whatever.  But, you know, you were like--whatever--you tell everybody that.  But, when she would say it, I, I really believed it for some reason.  And she, you know, and she would pull me aside sometimes and say, you know, I'm like you, you're, you're one of the smartest kids I've ever seen.  And that like made me feel good.  It made me want to live up to that as well.  And, you know, and I, and I looked around and I said, hi, you know, she thinks I'm the smartest kid of all of the gifted and talented kids, and so I really, really felt good.  And she could have said that to every student in there--who knows?  But she made me believe that.  And things like that--what she said--her name was Mrs. Hatt--but things like that that Ms. Hatt said helped, helped me believe in myself.
Speaker 1: H-A-T?
Speaker 2: H-A-T-T.  And she, so she was helpful in that.  But there weren't a lot of other teachers--there was one teacher named Ms. Ransom who was--who in, in high school she would always try to, to encourage me and, and, and mostly she would almost be my counselor.  She would help me rationalize things, think through things because I was going through a lot with my mother [Arlene Hunt] and just, just trying to find my way.  And she would help me.  So she was helpful, too.  But then there were so many other teachers that were not helpful.  There was a biology teacher who just--we just did not get along.  And she would say so many negative things.  And she wouldn't be outright saying things, but she would just, you know, didn't have any faith in me or a lot, most of the students that were in the class.  And I remember one time she said--actually, my sister wound up going to this school after--my younger sister after me and she had that same teacher.  And the teacher--she told the teacher--she said, "You know, my, my brother went to this school and you were his teacher."  And so she said, "Oh, yeah, is that right?  What, well, what was his name?"  And she said, "Oh, his name was Rameck."  And she said, "Oh, I, I remember him."  She was like, "What is he?  Is he a bum now?"  And she said this to my, to my sister.  And my sister stood up proudly and said, "No, he's a doctor."  And she's "Uh, uh, oh, I'm sorry."  She couldn't believe it and, you know.  And, and then she tried to kind of backpedal and "Oh, well, you know, I was just playing" and da da da da da.  But, you know, it just goes to show how she felt about me 'cause I wasn't surprised when I heard that because I felt that that's how she felt about me and felt about a lot of other students.  And I got a lot of that.  I mean, you know, you get, you get the whole, you know, the whole story about the guidance counselor saying, well, do this and do that, and you probably can't be this so try to be that and, you know, never help you aim for the stars and never encourage you to, to, to aim for the stars.

Speaker 1: Tell us about college and how was college?
Speaker 2: College [Seton Hall University] was fun.  When I first got to college, though, I still was trying to--I had a adjustment problem coming from where I lived, you know.  I was still--still had a little bit of that trying to be big and bad in me.  And so it took a while for me to get that, yeah, out of me.  But, you know, a semester or two I was fine and, and it was a new world.  It was, you know, it was me being on my own.  I finally had a, a place that I knew I could go and, and, and, and knew I had a place to sleep and wouldn't have to worry about where, you know, if I had to move in six months because, you know, I was there.  And I--so I--that wasn't a issue.  And I had a meal plan and I had cable and I had--so all of those fundamental things were taken care of.  I didn't have to worry about that.  So I felt good.  So then I could focus on my work.  So that, that was the easy part for me.  It was like, oh, now I could focus.  So I was able to focus on my work.  And then I had friends up there that were doing the same thing.  They were--Sam [Sampson Davis] and George [Jenkins] and then other people that we met--they were all up there to get an education.  And so it was refreshing.  And so I excelled in school because the, the peer pressure from the community wasn't there anymore.  And it was, it was just refreshing.  And I was able to work hard.  And, and I took a, took heed to a lot of lessons that I had learned in that summer program about, you know, sitting in the front of the class, you know, taking notes, asking questions, and all of these things and then soon as you're done with the class, go back to your room and, and, and review your notes and then go up and, and have fun and whatever you wanted to do--like, but, you know, get that out of the way first kind of thing.  And those lessons and being in that environment and being around those people helped me to excel.  And so school was a piece of cake.  The problem was I couldn't afford Seton Hall.  So I wasn't as--I, I was never on academic probation like I, my grades were bad, but I was always on financial probation.  Like every semester they were threatening to kick me out of school because I couldn't afford the bill.  And I would go to the bursar's office and cry and, and, and say, look, please, you can't let me get kicked out.  See, 'cause I was naïve enough to think that if you got straight A's and, and, and--they couldn't kick you out because you were a straight A student.  I didn't realize that college was a business and you had to pay.  You know, somebody had to pay for you to stay there.  I learned that pretty quickly and, and, and it was difficult to deal with but I got kind of use to the routine.  And it was like, you know, this poor little kid coming up and, and it, and, and, and begging to stay at school.  And the person who was in charge of the bursar, he, he had a compassionate heart.  And he saw--you know, I would, you know, present my grades and like, look, you can't kick me out of school--look at my grades.  Where am I gonna go back to?  You know, what am I gonna do?  I was like I'll do whatever you need me to do.  I--put me on a payment plan, something.  And he was compassionate to all three of us 'cause we all three had to go to the bursar every semester.  And he would, well, what could you pay?  And, you know, my bills were tens of thousands of dollars.  And, I, like I could pay twenty-five dollars a month.  And to me that was a big deal 'cause, I mean, I had, I had a job all throughout college, but I was only making like a hundred dollars a month, so twenty-five dollars a month was a big deal.  So he would just say okay, knowing that that wouldn't put a dent in the, in the bill.  But he, he understood, and, and he allowed us to continue.  And semester after semester we had to go and talk to him and, and, and beg again and beg including come up with new deals.  But he would--every time he would let our, let, let the hold off of our accounts and let us register for classes.
Speaker 1: That's really fortunate.
Speaker 2: Yeah, oh, yeah.  'Cause most people didn't have that, that, that, you know--so there were a lot of fortunate things that happened in our life.  I mean God played a big role in our lives.  I mean so many different things happened in our lives that we didn't plan--we couldn't have planned.  It was a higher power.  And I think, you know--.
Speaker 1: But then, again, like getting good grades--.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and doing your best, you know, and it kind of--it fortified your argument it seems like.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) That's true, that's true.
Speaker 1: It's not just luck, you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was definitely not just luck.  I, I would never chalk it up to luck.  I mean we, we worked hard (laughter).  I worked very, very hard.
Speaker 1: Not even divine intervention in a sense that, that you, you actually did the work.  And you could say and say, look at, look what we're doing.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, that's true.
Story_ID: 18228
Speaker 1: I think that he's working through us because he wants to use us as examples of things that can, that, that can be done if only you have a dream and only if you have, you know, positive peer pressure, and if only you have determination and discipline.  Like you can do really whatever you put your mind to and, and I am a firm believer of that.  You can really do whatever it is you put your mind to as long as you believe you have that goal and you, and you, and you have the energy to go about it and do it.  You can do it.
Speaker 2: Now what keeps--on the spiritual end of this, though, what keeps you all focused on service and, and helping people.  That seems to be like the real spiritual part of it.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, I think helping people is just--I mean back in--it started with me back in high school wanting to always help people at that--.  You know, sometimes you find a--at--some people are fortunate enough to find a purpose in life, and I think we've found that purpose in life.  And you just run with it.  And, and it's like, you know, I'm, I burn the midnight oil a lot of times.  And lot of people tell me, look, you better slow down because you're gonna go crazy.  And I'm like--who knows?  But (laughter), but it's all well worth it when we go out on that stage and we talk to these young people and we talk to adults and we talk to corporations and whoever we talk to.  And the response that you get is, is more than any money you can get.  I mean the emails that we get from people say how we changed their lives, how--I mean it's powerful that my life and my experiences and what I say to them and the, the, you know, and me speaking to them can motivate them to, to change their life.  I mean people--we get letters from jail, we get letters from all over the globe, actually--from India, from Germany about how our story helped to change somebody's life.  And that is like the biggest gift that I could ever receive.  And so it keeps me going.  That, that is the fuel that keeps me going.
Story_ID: 18229
Speaker 1: Medical school--now that was the--I mean was that more challenging than college?
Speaker 2: Yeah, medical school [at Robert Wood Johnson Medical School] was a lot more challenging than college.  It still wasn't that bad, but it was a lot more challenging than college.  I know, you know, Sam [Sampson Davis] sometimes tells the story how it was a little more challenging for him because he didn't feel like he belonged and things.
Speaker 1: Yeah, he says he didn't really want to be a doctor and actually he just wasn't sure, you know..
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Yeah. And he, he--I, I realized I wanted to be a doctor probably a little bit before him.  Like even though we were in the process it still didn't sink in with him as much as it sank in with me.  And I, I didn't mind doing the work.  I liked it, and it was--it felt good.  And so it was challenging--oh, yeah, it was very challenging.  But--and it was the hardest thing that I had ever dealt with, but it was okay.  It was like I was up for the challenge.  And I used to study with him and I used to study with this girl named Camille--and mostly with Camille.  Sam would study with us from time to time, but he had a different study method.  So, it was difficult for him to study with us sometimes because he couldn't study the way we studied.  But I even enjoyed studying.  It was like it was fun.  But it--but, you know, I had my ups and downs.  It was, it was rough, you know, because it, you know, the, the courses were challenging.  But like when you studied hard and then you take the test and then you do good, it was like rewarding.  And so I was up for the challenge.
Speaker 1: What was the roughest time that you had?  Was it, was there a time when you really thought that you wouldn't make it?
Speaker 2: No, not in medical school.  I felt pretty confident and secure.  Like I knew I was okay.  I knew I could do the work--that, that wasn't it.  I mean when I did my--the hardest point for me probably was my clinical rotations where it is not as hard for a lot of other people, but because it went from the bookwork to actually working in a hospital and having to work with different personalities and different people and here I'm a African American male trying to become a doctor and what do I know?  And I, and I, I got a lot of, a lot of that since--but I--you can't pay attention to stuff like that because it'll take too much--see, when you pay attention to things like that you--you're misdirecting your own energy.  Paying attention to that, not getting frustrated about that kind of stuff--you just kind of block it out.  It's, it, you know--and, and, and focus on what you're there for.  It's like almost like that Langston Hughes poem that it says, "I, too, sing America."  You, you can't really focus on the, on the negative things.  You know, people might say things to you, but you just, you know, go back in the--the poem talks about how, you know, he felt like he was a part of the team and he felt like he was a part of America.  He felt like he could contribute, but they would always tell him, aw get outta here.  You know, you know, he's the black guy.  Go back in the kitchen and serve me my dinner.  And, you know, he would do that.  He would go back in there and he would grow strong knowing that one day they would see his, his worth and his, and his importance.  And he would just grow strong and, and, and learn until that day.  And I almost felt that that poem--when I--first time I read that poem it touched home with me 'cause I almost felt like that was kind of my life like, you know, particularly when I was in medical school, was like because I almost felt like they didn't understand my importance in society, you know, or as being a physician.  And, and so I had to just sit back and take all of it in and grow strong and then one day they would realize that just by my actions how important and what I could contribute to this, to, to society.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Like what was graduation from medical school like?
Speaker 2: Graduation from medical school was, was like the culmination of like everything that we've, we've done.  All three of us graduated on the same stage for the, for the, you know, the third time for all three of us and the fourth time for them 'cause we all graduated high school together, we all graduated college together, and then we graduated professional school together.  And they actually even graduated eighth grade together, so it was four times for them.  So it was just like--it was amazing.  And then all three of our families--I mean we throughout the years we got, we, we got so close that we were closer with each other than we were with our families.  And we were a family.  And so we were so close that my family was their family and vice-versa.  So when one of us went up to get our diploma, all three families roared.  And we had like, you know, thirty or forty people per family, so it, it seemed like we had a cheering section.  George [Jenkins] always says that when, you know, each of us went up it was like a, it was a roar in the, in the audience.  And so people, you know, people was teasing us like, did you guys hire a cheering section, 'cause everybody seemed like they, they were--so it was, it was amazing.  And that started this whole whirlwind of publicity and, and, and, and everything.  Because after we graduated there was a article in the newspaper and from that article came a--a lot of the television appearances, came the 'Essence' awards, they came--us starting our foundation [Three Doctors Foundation, Inc.], everything, because we, we were able--'cause we, we were doing a lot of this stuff grassroots level and now we were able to, to take it and, and package it and deliver it through a vehicle.  Like we had a vehicle now to do some of the things that we've already, always been passionate about doing.
Story_ID: 18230
Speaker 1: Now what about residency?  Now, like the other two had discussed that as being tough part of--.
Speaker 2: Yeah, residency is, is, is hard, too.  Again, though, the residency that I chose was a very academic residency [at Robert Wood Johsnon University Hospital] and it was a little, it was more friendly on, on the wear and tear part.  So--.
Speaker 1: Okay, so Sam [Sampson Davis] had the like emergency room (unclear).
Speaker 2: Yeah, I, I was internal medicine.  So we--I was, I was in emergency room a lot because after Sam would evaluate them, he would pass them on to me--not literally, 'cause we're in different hospitals, but the emergency room docs would pass them on to me.  So, I was also in emergency room admitting patients, you know, chest pain, heart attacks.  And once he stabilized them, then I had to deal with the, the aftermath of it.  Or, oftentimes they can't necessarily be stabilized in emergency room and so once they get in there, once he diagnoses them with whatever they have, then it's my, my job to, to stabilize them.  So, it was, it was always challenging.  And when I was in--I did like a lot of ICU rotations.  And ICU is intensive care unit where people are obviously deathly ill, so that was challenging.  But it was interesting; it was fun.  I learned a lot and, and I did a lot of good.  So it was, it was--my perspective on it was a little different.  It was hard, but the perspective that I had was that, you know, I'm learning so much and I'm never going to have this experience again in my life.  So I enjoyed it.
Story_ID: 18231
Speaker 1: Tell us some about the Three Doctors Foundation.  What is the Three Doctors Foundation?
Speaker 2: The Three Doctors Foundation is, is a foundation with a mission to create opportunities for, for our communities through health education and, and, and mentoring and leadership.  And we operate off a premise of HELM because--it's a acronym and the reason we chose the acronym HELM is because we want to put our young people in our communities at the forefront, at the helm.  And that acronym stands for health, education, economics, leadership, and mentoring.  Economics, obviously, is a--that economics didn't use to be in there, but I had to put it in there because economics is so important to a community.  You can't develop a community unless you understand every at--the very essentials of economics.  And health obviously is important because you need to be healthy in body and soul in order to, to prosper.  And all the other things are, are kind of self, self-explanatory.  But we, we base a lot of our programs off of those things.  And we hold programs in, in our community.  And we, at the level now where we're just in our community, but we, we're developing resources and trying to gather resources to, to spread nationally because we, we're getting so many messages and positive feedback from people all over that want us to duplicate the things that we're doing in our communities all over.  And they want our message and our faces and our image to, to be all over.  And so we're trying to use our foundation as that vehicle to do that.  And so that's why we're meeting with and, and talking with a lot of corporations to do a lot of different things.  And we're, we're developing a 'Pact' scholarship.  We're gonna offer scholarships to, to groups of young people who want to, to, to pledge to help one another through as, as we did.  And so and that and, and, and our website we give a lot of health information and just a lot of other information that we do and the programs that we do over the summer with our mentoring programs and, and online mentoring programs that we're, we're developing.  And, you know, the skies are really the limit with that, with that organization.  And we started off slow--us not knowing how to even start a foundation.  I--you know, when we decided to start this, none of us knew what a 501(c)(3) was--had, had no idea what it was.  But, you know, and people always said, oh, you're not going to be able to start a foundation.  You don't know the first thing about it.  But, we didn't know the first thing about becoming doctors either, but we did it.  And so, we knew that we could do this, too.
Story_ID: 18232
Speaker 1: How did you feel about your generation?  Your generation has been characterized as the hip-hop generation.  I don't know ho accurate that is, but that's what people say.
Speaker 2: I think it's, I think it's generally pretty accurate.  I think this is the hip-hop generation.  I think it's cross-cultural as well.  I mean it's, it's really--hip-hop is the biggest music industry--I mean that, that's music--hip-hop.  You know, the--if you look at the Billboard charts over the last few years, majority of the number one Billboard, you know, songs are hip-hop, you know--a lot of them at least.  So, it is the hip-hop generation.  With that, though, there's a lot of, of problems that young people face because they--the messages that, that are in a lot of those songs, they, they take to heart.  And, and I, I love hip-hop.  I mean, me and George [Jenkins] had a rap group in college.  I mean, so, you know, hip-hop is, is, is in me.  I mean I love it.  I still love it to this day.  And--but I understand it as a form of entertainment--and some people don't.  You know, just like if I were to go to see a movie or--it's a form of entertainment to me and--but I also know that it--it's actually a little deeper than that.  You know, it's obviously deeper than that because it comes from, from, from, you know, a lot of poets, you know, putting it into music, musical form and talking about what goes on in our communities and, and, and things that happen in our communities.  The only, the only thing that I would, would say about it is that, you know, I'm not really one who likes to talk a lot of rhetoric.  And a lot, a lot of people that are so-called leaders and so-called this and so-called that likes, like to speak a lot of rhetoric.  And rhetoric in a way is kind of good.  You know, it gets you motivated and gets you amped up.  But I always found that, you know, when I would listen to speakers and they'd get me amped up and hyped and want to do something, they never really gave me a solution on, on, on how to fix it or what to do.  And so you always left there with, with a void.  And I think sometimes hip-hop talks about a lot of the issues that are in our communities and sometimes even glorifies them, but we don't really in that music, we don't give a solution as to how to fix some of these things.  And I think in our community it's, it's a lot of, lot of our young people trying to live, live a lot of that stuff out.  And it's unfortunate that that we don't--since we don't have role models, our only role models are athletes and, and entertainers and so that's all we strive for.  And we don't strive for academics.  And we really need to refocus.
Story_ID: 18233
Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns for the black community?  It may sound redundant, but we always ask this question.
Speaker 2: No, some of the things that I hope for, for the black community is that we refocus a lot on education.  And I think that's some of the things that we're trying to do, trying to put a face to health and education.  The Three Doctors [Foundation, Inc.] are trying to do that because we really, you know, we--and get role models back in our communities and so that we can strive for, for things other than sports and entertainment.  Not that we shouldn't strive for sports and entertainment 'cause that's okay, too.  But it's just that we should also strive for education.  I mean education should always be your primary thing, if anything.  And sports and entertainment should be your, your backup or your secondary kind of thing.  And oftentimes in our community sports and entertainment is the only thing that we have, the only alternative.  And I want to change that, and I want to--because we leave so many bright people in our communities and, and they could contribute so much to society.  So I just want things to change in a positive light and on all aspects in, in general.  And that's a, it's a--there's, there's not one solution because there wasn't, there's not one problem that got us here.  So, there's, obviously, since there's more than one problem, it's going to need more than one solution.  So, I think as long as everybody does their part as far as helping to elevate their community, I think, I think we'll be fine.  And it, and, and, and we will be fine because we're strong people.  And, I mean, we have to be because just the, the, this, the people that made it through--it's just the, the passage to make it, to make it here, they, they, they were the strongest of the strong.  That's how they made it.  And, and the things that we've been through, I mean, and to, to still be here and, and to still have a, a lot of us being productive members of society is, is amazing.  So, we'll, we'll be okay.  It's just people need to give back.  I mean one of the problems I think with, that we need to change is the people that do make it, you know, so, you know, so-called make it, they need to, to be visible in the community.  People need to know that people from their community that have gone on to professional lives actually exist and that they did come from their community.  'Cause one of the programs that we did--we brought sixty or so professionals back to meet the kids that lived in the community.  And these kids were astounded at--you run this company and you lived on my block, you lived in my building?  They can't believe it.  And then they start, they start to rethink and they start say, well, I can do it.  See, they knew they could be a rapper because all--most of the rappers talk about how they came from the block that they lived on.  And they know they could be entertainer 'cause a lot of entertainers came from the same thing.  But, you know, it's hard for them to believe that they could be a doctor.  It's hard for them to believe that they could be, you know, astronaut or whatever or, or a CEO of a company.  And so it's important for our, our, our, you know professional people to come back to the community and do something.  And I don't dare to say that you have to necessarily live, you know, in the, in the projects.  And, you know, you deserve, you got, you could afford to buy a nice house, you, you deserve that.  You worked hard.  But, at least be visible, at least be visible.

Speaker 1: You've accomplished quite a bit at a young age and you've got a lot more to do, obviously.  But what at this point would you consider as your legacy?
Speaker 2: 'The Pact'.  I think 'The Pact' is, is so far, what--and like you said we have a lot more to do, a lot more that we're gonna do.  But 'The Pact' is always gonna be that foundation of what we've done--about how we took a negative and made it a positive or how we took that power of friendship and turned it into something very positive and became physicians and dentists and, and, and, and giving back to our community.  'The Pact' is more than just us being friends.  It's, it's about making that pact to, to, to go back and help and, and, and showcasing what can be done if you have a pact and if you believe in, in your goals and your dreams and if you have some positive reinforcement around you.  'Cause you--it's hard if everybody beating you down every day telling you you can't do it.  It, it's hard to--it's, it's--I mean psychology teaches us that if somebody tells you something long enough and it's not combated with anything else, no matter how stupid it sounds, you're going to believe it--just the bottom line.  That's how your brain works.  And so a lot of people in our community always were told certain things and there's nothing to combat that, that, that, you know, whatever they're told.  And so sooner or later they're gonna believe it.

Speaker 1: You seem to have, have an--I guess encountered along the ways some strong sense of history that, you know--when you were telling me the story about the fight for black history in your school and throughout your responses to these questions, you've talked about history and we've talked about slavery making us stronger and some other things.  What--where did you get your historical perspective?
Speaker 2: I think I--I mean my historical perspective could be a lot stronger, but I'm a very conceptual person.  So I might not be able to spit exactly the facts, but I do understand a lot of the concepts.  And I got a lot of that from growing up and being around a lot of proactive people and my uncle and them were in the Nation [of Islam].  And, and, and, and at least when I was younger I talked about how my family was in the Nation and, and, and a lot of, being around a lot of people that were, were progressive people and being a lot--they were in a lot of different organizations.  And I was always an inquisitive person and would always ask questions.  And one of the--I remember when I got my first job working in the barbershop sweeping up hair, the, the, the person who owned the barbershop was a, was, was in the Nation.  And he would always talk about, you know, black issues.  And, and I would always--we would have debates.  And this was, you know, at the time he might have been a, you know, fifty-year-old man, you know, debating with a thirteen-year-old kid.  And, and I would try to stomp him, you know, on a lot of things and--"No, that doesn't sound right" and da da da.  And he, he--it tickled him that I would, I would sit there and try to debate with him.  And I mean this guy has, has so much more wisdom than me and knowledge, but it tickled him that I, you know, that I, you know, I tried to stand up to him on those issues.  But he took that to turn it back on me and say, "Well, you know, how do you know?  Go look it up and come back to me," and "Well, think about this.  Did you ever think about that?"  And then it, it started my mind to, to, you know, turn the wheels, and I start--he had me thinking differently.  He had me thinking about the world.  He had me thinking about--he would have me asking the question why a lot--and, and, and about everything, about the, the situation that we're in and, and, and how this thing's happened and, and a whole lot of stuff.  And I think, you know--his name was Brother Bill.  And I think that's, you know, how, how, how it kind of started because he, he, he always had my mind going.  So from there and just a lot of things reinforced that.  And, and at first it was a little misdirected because, you know, I used to, you know, just like all this, you know, you know, everything is messed up.  Nobody wants to, to help us and nobody wants to do this.  And I--and it wasn't until I got older and I got more mature and I got wiser that I realized that we need to help us (laughter).  We need to, you know, stop, you know--we need to, to get out there and, and, and do these things for our, for our people.  You know, we need to, to help each other and, and don't look for no handouts really.  I mean, on the one hand somebody can make a argument, you know, you, you do things and, and, and that might be true.  And there's people out there to fight that, that battle.  But in my mind my battle is to, to do what I can to directly help people as opposed to try to make somebody else help--help me.  I'd rather do it myself because then I could--'cause then I, I know how I want it done as opposed to how, asking somebody else to do it and they say yeah, and they do it their way.  Then you get mad at them for doing it their way.  And then you gotta go back in a roundabout way in order to get them to fix it.  Do it yourself.  Fix it yourself.  Band together and do it.  Don't ask nobody for a program.  You make the program.  You do it.  Then that way you know it's done the way you want it done.  And, and, and I think people miss the boat on that sometimes.  But I do understand the reason for it.  And I do understand that it's needed and so it's okay.  Because in the struggles there's, there's foot soldiers, there's generals, there's this, there's that.  Everybody can't be the same person.  You gotta kind of get it when you fit it.  You know, everybody plays a different position.  And so I, I say all of that to say that I think my position is to, to kind of give back.  And I learned that over the years as to what my role is and, and what I should be doing and, and, and what I want to do and what my goal and mission is in life and what makes me happy.  So--and, and, and that's what--and that makes me happy trying to give back and helping people and, and, and, and also helping myself.  I mean you can't--you, you gotta help yourself before you can help others, obviously.  So, you know, all of these things are, are, are very important.  You need to, to, to get out there and, and try to make, make, make a change.

Speaker 1: How would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: I'd like to be remembered as a compassionate person--somebody who really cares for people, somebody who gave it his all and, and dedicated his life to try to, to make a change.  At the same time a person who loved himself and his family and, and enjoyed life.  I oftentimes look at people that we remember.  And we remember them for sacrificing for others.  And almost you feel like they didn't enjoy their lives.  Like they sacrificed their lives to help others.  And I really don't feel that that, that it's, it's either one way or another way.  I feel that in order to, to give the most to other people, you have to be able to have some self-enjoyment first.  So I want people to know--and, and I think that that also serves a message to people that, wow, you know, that you can actually be happy in doing these kind of things as opposed to always when you see them they're looking angry and they're always--you know, because they're fighting for the cause and they're always angry, you know, and got a frown on their face.  You could, you could be happy and enjoy your life and, and reap the benefits of life and, and that'll help you even more so get out there and do what you need to do to help--give to your community.  And I want people to know that.  I want people to remember me--this guy, you know, he was a happy guy.  He loved life, he loved what he does, and he gave so much back to the community in a, in a big way.
