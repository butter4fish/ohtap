Speaker 1: Before we go into depth, there are five lightweight People magazine-ish type questions that we always ask as kind of a warm up--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --that only require a short answer.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: The first one is do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: (Laughter)  Absolutely not, I just love to eat.  But I have several favorite foods.  I'm from the South, so I would say a nice pot of collard greens and skillet hot water cornbread.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's one of my favorites.
Speaker 1: And do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I do love red.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I love the winter.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I love the winter very much.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Believe it or not but late night service at church, late night service.  And I know you're probably wondering why am I calling that a vacation?  Because it's very, very difficult for me to get away and a vacation to me is a place I can go when I can go and just be so comfortable and so relaxed and so at peace and so rested, that would be the place for me.  Anything else is a party.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That would be the place for me.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now the last one is do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Yes.  God is good all the time.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That would be mine.
Story_ID: 296741
Speaker 1: Now I'm gonna ask you about your family history.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I'm gonna ask about your mother's side and your father's [J.D. Echols] side--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --but we'll start with your mother's side of the family.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: My mother's full name is Will, W-I-L-L, Eva, E-V-A, and her last name is Echols.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But what was her maiden name?
Speaker 2: Harmon, her maiden name is Harmon, H-A-R-M-O-N.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: My mother's birthdate is in March.  She's seventy.  So the 13th of March and she's seventy and she was born in I believe in Yazoo, Mississippi [Yazoo City, Mississippi].
Speaker 1: Okay.  That's Yazoo City, I think, right?
Speaker 2: Yes sir.
Speaker 1: Yazoo City, Mississippi.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: I know some people from Yazoo City.  Yeah.  Okay.  Now what do you know about the ancestors on your mother's side?  How far back can you trace the ancestors on that side of the family?
Speaker 2: Okay.  Her mother is Jessie [ph.], Jessie Harmon.  Her father I never met and I was told that he was a minister; however we never met.  My mother had many brothers and sisters.  I believe there were eighteen children born to Jessie Harmon.  I met approximately--I think I've met about nine of them.  Approximately something like eight girls, eight or nine girls and the rest were boys.  The family, a lot of teachers, a lot of educators.  I know there's a brother living in Mississippi now who's a dentist in Chicago [Illinois], Uncle Charles [Harmon] in Chicago.  She's lost a number of her brothers and sisters most recently.  I remember Aunt Myrtle [Harmon] died a couple of months ago.
Story_ID: 296742
Speaker 1: Can you give us your [maternal] grandfather's name?
Speaker 2: I cannot.  I can give you my paternal grandfather's name and that's Thomas Echols.
Speaker 1: Okay.  We'll get to that in a second.
Speaker 2: Okay but still on my mom [Will Eva Harmon Echols] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I just want I want to do this side.
Speaker 2: On my mother's side--.
Speaker 1: But what do they do?  What do they do for a living most of them?  You named some people that were a lot of teachers you said, and there were some--.
Speaker 2: And this is what I was told--.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Again, I did not know any of them.  I knew of them and I saw them occasionally but I do know they were educators.  I do know there's a dentist [Echols' maternal uncle, Charles Harmon] in Chicago [Illinois].  I believe one is a retired bus driver.  I know there's a lot of land in the South.  I know one of my [sic.] brothers adopted my brother.  I found out when I became an adult that I have a brother.  His name is Earl [ph.] and he was adopted by my mother's brother, one of her brothers and we were raised as cousins.  And I remember the people in the project used to always say, "Girl your mama had a baby."  "You got a brother."  And I would go, "No, I don't."  They'd say, "Girl you got a brother," right.  And I would go to my mom and ask and she wouldn't answer.  She wouldn't deny it but she wouldn't say yes.  And later I found out indeed I have a brother also in Jackson, Mississippi, who's an engineer.  Looks just like my mama.
Story_ID: 296743
Speaker 1: Now what accounts for this kind of, all this mystery in terms of that?  Did--now I think--
Speaker 2: Excellent question.
Speaker 1: --your mother [Will Eva Harmon Echols] went to Memphis [Tennessee] and left a lot of family in Yazoo City [Mississippi]?
Speaker 2: Yes.  What I'm told what happened and I intend to be extremely sensitive because my mother is still living and I know some of it is painful for her, however, I do intend to be as truthful as I can and indeed continue to give her the respect. But what I did hear was she was at one of the colleges, she was in college and she became pregnant.  She became pregnant with Earl [ph.] and that was a no-no apparently in the family and I'm told some other things happened, what I have no idea.  I also was told that she had a different father than the other, than her siblings.  Because her siblings--she was one of the younger kids, her siblings' father had passed and she had a different father and from what I heard she, she became a time when she was a little bitter.  She felt she was too dark you know.  She was short, she had the short nappy hair.  Now that's what I heard, I can't validate any of this.  Her brothers and sisters a lot of them are tall.  Most--as a matter of fact I got my height--because my mama and my dad [J.D. Echols] are short, but I got my height from my aunts and uncles on my mother's side.  A lot of six feet individuals, large women.  And we were raised--I was, I was told that when she became pregnant, she moved to Memphis and she and, and the father of the child I don't know who Earl's father is, however, for a long time we had no relationship whatsoever.  And when we saw--when Earl and I saw one another, we were cousins.  We were told we were cousins.  And then my mom moved to Memphis and she was not with the family.  As a matter of fact I don't remember getting visits, calls.  I believe--I know of one sister, there was one sister, her name is Winnie Jean Stanton [ph.].  There was one sister who always showed love.  Who would, who would visit us?  I remember her visiting; I remember playing with her children.  I remember that as a child.  Now I don't know what her relationship with my mother was like, but it too ended negatively unfortunately.  But I do remember that, that wonderful woman.  I remember there being a lot of siblings.  I remember there being lots of stories because there was a lot--there was some money involved regarding land and all of that and I just remember my mother saying I'm getting away from it all.  I'm not--I'm getting away.  And she met my dad and married my dad and had my sisters [Winnie Echols Berry and Wanda Echols], had us and he left when I was three.  He went to get some milk.  He said he was going to get some milk and he didn't come back.  And I remember my mom saying she wasn't going to let this get to her.  I, I remember her she burned the clothes in the bathtub.  She took all of his clothes and she--and I remember that and she would always say to us you gotta go to college, don't depend on anyone.  You gotta do this for yourselves.  And what is so interesting, I think I'm allowed to say this, now in terms of her siblings, the aunts and the uncles, they all want--they want to meet us and say hi to us.  I've been invited to Paris [France].  One of the aunts has a daughter who's an opera singer and she's invited me--Jackie [ph.] has invited me several times to go with her to visit her in, in France and various places when she's in concert.  Other family members, aunts and uncles would invite us, would invite me and my sisters to join them and their families but this a little difficult to do when you're over forty and you've grown.  So we grew up, basically it was just my mom.  My mom and the immediate family on her side when it comes to her side of the family.  But it was very different on my father's side, but not on my mother's side.
Story_ID: 296744
Speaker 1: Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: His name is J.D. Echols.
Speaker 1: Now does the J.D. stand for?
Speaker 2: I'm not certain, I believe it's Jesse [ph.], it may be it may not, but they've always used he's always said J.D. just J.D.
Speaker 1: Sometimes it does and sometimes it doesn't.
Speaker 2: It doesn't.  Okay.
Speaker 1: J.D. Echols.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Now what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: That I do not know.  He was born I believe in Mississippi and he was born to Katie Holmes.  Is it Katie Holmes?  No I'm sorry last name Franklin, Katie Franklin.
Speaker 1: So his mother's--
Speaker 2: His mother's name is Franklin.  Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what do you know about the ancestors on his side?
Speaker 2: Very different.  Grew up with them.  My absolutely favorite individual in the world, one of my favorite individuals is my grandmother Katie Franklin who died a couple of years ago.  We all lived in the projects together in LeMoyne Gardens, in Memphis, Tennessee.  And she was just always very, very kind to me, very loving and very supportive, and very encouraging.  She had two children, my father, J.D. Echols, and and Jamela Franklin.  Jamela is her baby girl.  As a matter of fact I followed Jamela to Cornell [Cornell University, Ithaca, New York].  My father's side of the family, his father Thomas Echols, that's my father's dad, just a really, really great guy.  He passed as well.  And I remember on Christmas as he would give us five dollars.  So every Christmas I looked forward to going across the street and collecting five dollars.  So even though we did not have a relationship with my father as children, we did have one with his father and sisters and brothers.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So when your father left, did he ever come back?
Speaker 2: He never--he did not come back to us no.  No, he never came back.
Story_ID: 296745
Speaker 1: Lived (simultaneous)-
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) But what hap--
Speaker 1: --across the street?
Speaker 2: We lived across the street--well initially we lived in the projects [LeMoyne Gardens] in Memphis, Tennessee.  We left the projects when I was fourteen because my mother [Will Eva Harmon Echols] was adamant about, about getting off welfare, no I was about twelve.  And she wanted to get off welfare and I remember moving to an apartment place, an apartment on Lauderdale [Street] and Trigg [Avenue] in Memphis, Tennessee and this is the kind of woman my mommy is what makes her so awesome given all that she's gone through and how she's had to struggle independently.  I remember one winter there was a lot of snow outside and I really wanted to go to school.  I didn't wanna stay at home and my mom cried.  She'll say, "Well baby you can't go because you gotta walk almost a mile to get to school and your hands are gonna freeze," right.  And I said mom but I don't wanna stay in this house by myself, I wanna go, right.  And she had on some boots and they had holes in them and she took, and I think this is where my strength comes from, she took the cardboard, she took some cardboard and put them in her boots.  She took the socks; she had about four, three or four pairs of socks on.  She took her socks off, off her feet and wrapped them on my hand because she said they were the thickest in the house and they would keep me warm and she put them on my hands and she took the shoestring out of my sneaker, out a pair of sneakers and she wrapped it around each one and I walked to school and she had to walk about I don't know maybe a quarter a mile to the bus stop and stand outside and wait on the bus and when she came home from work you know a couple of her toes had frozen and I was warm and comfortable.  Her strength is just unbelievable, her strength and her faith unbelievable, unmatched, unchallenged.  And so that transitioned that life there leaving the projects and going to that apartment and being with my mom and my siblings who then left there and went to another apartment and we were down the street from my father's [J.D. Echols] people. However, my father, my father's father, Thomas Echols, had remarried so he was now with another--he was with another woman.  He was married and what I did find out is that he was never married to my [paternal] grandmother [Katie Franklin].  He was never married to my father's mom.  But they were very kind to us in terms as far as a child is concerned, they were there and so I got to know them and their family, his brothers and sisters, his half-brothers and sisters.  And we grew up with them.  They were in and out our lives and supportive and they're really, I mean they're just really wonderful people and now everyone is--I mean everyone is very kind and volunteers to be a part of our lives and wanting to meet and introduce and all of the cousins and the distant cousins and all of that so time heals a lot of wounds and what's so beautiful we would actually live across the street from my father's parents and my father would--my father's father, my father would come into town, come to Memphis from Chicago [Illinois] to visit his family but would not come across the street to see us.  And that was painful for me.  But I eventually found out why.  I eventually you know whatever the tension was between all of the adults and all of that, that was what they had to deal with and so I understand that now.
Speaker 1: So he didn't feel like it was safe to come across?
Speaker 2: Exactly.  Exactly.  Whatever the tension was between the two of them and the family, all of the family vibes and what I do credit my mom with what makes her special to me is that everything that was going on on both sides of the family, she kept us out of it.  She refused to bring us into it.  We did not.  We didn't--if she knew someone was telling us something, she'd say no baby don't listen to all that.  You just gotta go on with your life and do what you need to do.  She's incredible.  That's a respect that I have for her for giving us the ability to just grow up and be children so we were able to have a life like as children.  You know we weren't bitter.  We don't hate anyone (laughter).  We weren't bitter with anyone.  Even when I talk to my brother Earl [ph.] now, he's not bitter.  Our attitude is they all did what they needed to do during that time and we have no idea what life was like for them.  We were children.  I mean I was poor and didn't know I was poor.
Story_ID: 296746
Speaker 1: Now did you get a chance to know your father [J.D. Echols]--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --later on?
Speaker 2: Um-hm later on.  My mother [Will Eva Harmon Echols] wrote me a letter when I graduated from Cornell [University, Ithaca, New York] and shared a lot of things with me.  She felt I was mature enough to handle it.  She shared a lot.  Years later contact was made with my father.  Well my, my one of my sisters [Winnie Echols Berry] made contact with him sooner before I did because she wanted him to know his grandchildren and she had two children, she and her husband had children, and eventually I got a chance to--I went to Chicago [Illinois] to see him.  I did.  And it was just wonderful.  He was so excited and kind.  So now we're in communication.  We call, we talk.  As a matter of fact at one of the family reunions, he said, he said that the one of the most disappointing and the saddest things about his life now is that he can't take any of the credit for the individuals, for the women we have become, for the people we have become.  He was so proud.  So he has a good heart.  He means well, good intentions, so.
Story_ID: 296747
Speaker 1: Who do you think you take after the most when you think about them or what traits do you take after your parents [Will Eva Harmon Echols and J.D. Echols]?
Speaker 2: I have my mother's strength and faith.  I am told I even sound like her sometimes.  I will take a chance.  I'm not afraid.  I believe I have also my mother's gift of gab.  I love people and I love to talk.  I would say my mom.  I'm a lot like her.  And what's so wonderful about that I mean there are things, places where I'm not like her.  And I can comfortably identify that.  I would have to say my mom.  A lot of me is my mom.  I am Will Eva so; I'm a tall, taller version, a taller, educated version of my mom.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My mom.
Story_ID: 296748
Speaker 1: Do you have earliest childhood memory, first memory?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I've always been tall.  Always tall, I was tall and thin used to weigh like eighty-five and ninety pounds.  I was always the biggest one in class and the boys would jump on me, beat me up and I remember these twins Ron [ph.] and Don [ph.], I was like nine or eight, they wanted to push me in a ditch.  I remember even younger I went to a school called Georgia Avenue School [Georgie Avenue Elementary School, Memphis, Tennessee] and they said it was a school for retarded children in Memphis, Tennessee, across from Booker T. Washington [Booker T. Washington High School, Memphis, Tennessee].
Speaker 1: Now I was trying to get at do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: The earliest?
Speaker 1: Yeah, the first--your first memory?
Speaker 2: Hmm.
Speaker 1: If you don't, it's okay.
Speaker 2: No, my, my earliest would be it's, it's a conglomeration because see you don't remember what people say to you.  You remember how they make you feel.  So I remember how events made me feel.  Those how--that's how I, how I, how I move and function so I remember a series of things that made me feel a certain way.  I remember the earliest in all honesty had to do again with my mom [Will Eva Harmon Echols] in terms of what she was going through and just her, her we couldn't leave the house.  We had to be in the house by six thirty you know.  We couldn't--we had to make certain all the homework was done, couldn't go out, social life was rather limited and just constantly as a child and as a young girl at nine, ten, eleven o'clock--at nine, ten, eleven years of age you know don't bring mama no babies, no babies, no babies.  You gotta go to school, no babies.  And we'd hear that all the time.  You know the other kids in the neighborhood can do it but you guys can't do it.  There's more for you.  I just want you to get your education and just so everything centered around that in my house, that education and focusing and growing up to be a wonderful adult and to be happy.  That's what she wanted and in the church.  My earl- in the church, Morning View Baptist Church [Memphis, Tennessee], I was eight years old directing the choirs and Baptist Training Union.
Story_ID: 296749
Speaker 1: Wait a minute you were--Morning View Baptist [Church, Memphis, Tennessee], you were, you were directing the choir?
Speaker 2: Directing the choirs.
Speaker 1: Eight years old?
Speaker 2: I directed the, the, the youthful choir because they would have--you weren't like the choir director, but they would have various events where you sing and direct the choirs so I did that and then once I became older, a teenager, I started directing it in terms of the services.  But we would have programs and pageants or whatever and for Sunday school mom [Will Eva Harmon Echols] kept us in church, school and church.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: School and church.
Speaker 1: Okay so you went to that church all the way through?
Speaker 2: Oh yes.  All the way through.  All the way through--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and learned so much.  I can--that's my family that church.  There are people, my siblings and I we'd have one--my sisters [Winnie Echols Berry and Wanda Echols] and I we'd have like one pair of shoes and they would like take us shopping.  They taught us how to, how to, how to dress, to go after the finer things in life.  The church family was unbelievable.  The Morning View Baptist Church church family was unbelievable.
Story_ID: 296750
Speaker 1: I neglected to ask you when we first started to explain the significance of your name.  You have a very interesting name.  Here we are in Los Angeles [California] and you run an educational institution [Educating Young Minds, Los Angeles, California] and your name is [HistoryMaker] Angeles Echols, which means angel school basically, right?
Speaker 2: It does.
Speaker 1: But there's more.  So how did your mother [Will Eva Harmon Echols] come up with this so?
Speaker 2: I was told that when I was born I was a very, very long baby, long limbed and--.
Speaker 1: 'Cause you're tall right?
Speaker 2: Yes I am.  Pretty close to six feet and when she was in college, she had a lot of friends, she had made some friends earlier and that she wanted to sort of like please all of her classmates so I had a little of everybody's name, her various friends.  I was told that Angeles meant having to do with schools, angel of schools or my entire name had something to do with the title educator of schools, director of schools, leader of children and angel.  I used to be really, really excited about it and I would talk about it a lot and what happened is now people will come up to me and tell me you're an educator. Did you know you wanted to be an educator when you were younger, because your name means educator of schools you know, and angel of schools, and I said no.  So there's a God I believe.  I know that LaRose is French.  I believe Angeles is Spanish, I believe.  Echols I believe there is Echols I believe it's French Echols or but then and Patricia, I'm not certain, so--.
Speaker 1: You know Latin or--.
Speaker 2: Probably Latin or um-hm.  And so I was really excited about it and I just think it's quite interesting that I am in education and working with babies and kids.
Story_ID: 296751
Speaker 1: Can you describe the sights and sounds and smells of growing up [in Memphis, Tennessee]?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Sights, projects [LeMoyne Gardens, Memphis, Tennessee].  Lots of people, lots of babies, but family you know the next door neighbor watched out for you.  If something happened I could hear someone calling and screaming for my mom to come on down Will Eva [Harmon Echols], come and get your baby or if it's dark and I'm outside and I should be home she'd see if my mom's at work, the neighbors would send us home and make certain we were in the apartment and locked in safely.  So support.  We were poor but I didn't know it at the time.  I remember feeding, being able to eat at the neighbor's homes.  If mama was working, got home late, someone would feed us, the neighbor would make sure we had something to eat.  Church [Morning View Baptist Church, Memphis, Tennessee], singing.  Somebody was always singing and dancing.  Good times because I think now at this point in my life, I think poverty is an attitude, it's a, it's an attitude and that just didn't exist in my neighborhood.  Everybody supported.  I can tell you I can give you list, I can give you my neighbors' names, Mrs. Green [ph.], Ms. Mae Ella [ph.], Evi Jo [ph.].  I can give you their names and I can give you my relatives' names.  Individuals who nurtured me.  Sights and sounds, colors.  Lots of blue, lots of blue.  Colors of blue.  Colors are and red of course for the night life, the whole party thing.  It was all so interesting everybody went to church on Sunday and they got drunk on Saturday and Friday night.  Everybody looked forward to the weekend.  That was real.  But my mama, we had to be in the house.  Also you had asked earlier one of the things I remembered as a child, my mom used to give me fifty dollars and I would go to Prescott Drugs [Prescott Drug Store, Memphis, Tennessee] and get Christmas presents.  I was the dad in my house.  I was dad.  I had to take care of my siblings, watch out for my siblings while my mama worked and she would give me fifty dollars and I would go and buy as much as I could with fifty dollars and I'd get as many two for ten dollar items as I could and then wrap them up individually and it looked like we had a lot of toys. And then I'd open the window and let the kids in the neighborhood see the gifts. Then I'd get a spanking when my mama got home 'cause I couldn't wrap them back the way she had them wrapped so she could tell I had opened them.  But those are the memories I had.  I remember my first Barbie doll.  I wanted a Barbie doll so I got--went and got one of the knockoffs from Prescott Drugs and called it Barbie.  I think in the store they called it Barbara so that was my Barbie doll 'cause I wanted my blonde haired doll.  Hmm sounds, when lots--when there was fighting, the husbands and the boyfriends were fighting, that was real but that was the life, that was--it was common so it didn't frighten me.  I remember Ms. Mae Ella she was slightly intoxicated and I won't give her last name out of respect, but I remember she was stabbed, and she was one of our next door neighbors and she had been stabbed in a lovers' quarrel and she was intoxicated.  She was so intoxicated she, she, she ran, she had her hand covering the wound and she ran next door to my mom right, and so my mom immediately sees her and starts praying right and dialing for you know to get help, but Ms. Mae Ella didn't feel a thing, she said, "Oh Will Eva he done cut me.  I'm gonna have to now kill him," (laughter) but that was the environment.  And then the very next day she went to the hospital, she was wrapped.  The very next day we were all having dinner together including with the individual who had cut her.  It was just that and nobody you know.  She said stay out of it, we stayed out of it.  But my mother continued to support and without judging.  There was no judgment.  Nobody was better than anybody.  There was no judgment, there were no, no, no big yous and little yous.  No we had to all hang in there.  Those were the scenes I remember and that's just keeping it real as my kids say, keep it real, Ms. Echols.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I grew up with that, that's what I saw and my mother would protect us and nurture us from that. That's why she would always say, "Baby I gotta get you guys out the projects, time for us to go."
Story_ID: 296752
Speaker 1: How would you describe yourself as a little girl?  What were you interested in, and what was your personality like?
Speaker 2: Inquisitive.  I was blessed.  I've always--I thought I've always been bright.  I did well in school, a very quick reader, quick learner.  Nosy and inquisitive, there's a difference, but I was both.  Aggressive when need be very assertive and at times too aggressive.  I remember my mom [Will Eva Harmon Echols]--things would happen as a conversation with all the adults in the room and I would hear the stories and then I would go and say, "Mom, but that--it didn't happen that way.  Mom that's not what happened.  Mom did you hear that lady, but that's not the truth."  And my mom would turn it to me and she'd say, "Baby you gotta stay in a child's place.  That's grown folks' conversation."  That's the lesson I learned, there was a place that I had to stay.  I remember, I was, I was, I loved people and friends, I wanted friends, but I was primarily a loner when I was younger up until about thirteen, fourteen, I was a loner.  People did not aggressively seek my friendship.  I was by myself, so I read.   And I was very thin.  I considered--I was told I was unattractive.  The boys used to tease me profusely so it's interesting when I go home now they, they propose to me.
Speaker 1: You not really--so really you were considered unattractive?
Speaker 2: Oh most definitely and a nerd.  Oh yes, I've got pictures, and a nerd.
Speaker 1: It seems to be a pattern with a lot of people that grow up to be--you read stories of people that grow up to be models and so forth, but they always have the story about them being--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --considered unattractive and gawky or something--
Speaker 2: Um-hm, that's right.
Speaker 1: --teenagers.
Speaker 2: And again I got to attribute to my mom who would always say, "You a late bloomer babe, but you gonna be just fine trust mama on that."  And how she put it and a hell of a woman, that's what she would say.  So as you can tell I like her, I like my mama, she did a good thing, good job.  So I didn't have a lot of friends no.  Not until I got older.  In high school [Hamilton High School, Memphis, Tennessee], it got a little better because I was able to get into clubs but I was never invited to the sororities, the girl cliques when they had the parties, I wasn't taken to the prom.
Story_ID: 296753
Speaker 1: Now when did you go to--
Speaker 2: --my senior prom.
Speaker 1: --grade school?
Speaker 2: Elementary?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: (Cough) Excuse me, Georgia Elementary [Georgia Avenue Elementary School, Memphis, Tennessee] and I also went to a small school--the Trinity area [of Memphis, Tennessee].  I cannot remember the name of that school but it's when we moved to the second apartment.
Speaker 1: Is that the school you finish in grade school in?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes I did.  And then went to--did Hamilton Middle School [Memphis, Tennessee] and then Hamilton High School [Memphis, Tennessee].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Now I may have done a couple of months--several months at Hamilton Elementary [Hamilton Elementary School, Memphis, Tennessee] when we made the transition near my [paternal] grandfather's [Thomas Echols] home, Wilson [Street] and Kerr [Avenue].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But that was just for several months of my last--sixth grade.
Story_ID: 296754
Speaker 1: --Grade year (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So you were a good student in school?
Speaker 1: Oh most definitely.  I was a good student, made straight A's and Bs, sometimes straight A's but I always made U's in conduct, red U's.
Speaker 2: Unsatisfactory.
Speaker 1: Unsatisfactory conduct.  Es and Ss in work habits but U's unsatisfactory.
Speaker 2: Now what, what could you possibly be doing that was wrong?
Speaker 1: Asking questions, always raising my hand.
Speaker 2: What kind--I mean asking questions, what is wrong--.
Speaker 1: Answering questions, not giving other kids a chance, just aggressive, assertive.  And also trying to find out who I am, wanting to be liked, wanting to be seen by the other classmates, wanting to impress.  We go through that as children.  Wanting to be a part of, wanting them to want me to be a part of.  All kinds of reasons and eventually you learn that that's--that doesn't do a thing but you get U's in conduct (laughter) and something was so great the teachers would always tell my mom [Will Eva Harmon Echols], she's such a good kid, but she just talks too much, she talks, talks, talks, talks, talks too much.
Speaker 2: Okay so you were talking to somebody right.
Speaker 1: Oh yeah.
Speaker 2: Other kids.
Speaker 1: Oh year sure, talked to other kids, other adults.  I talk, I'd talk to the bulletin board if it wouldn't respond because remember again when I went home it was primarily me, my mom and my younger sibling so I didn't have anyone to talk to at home and my mom, I didn't have that kind of relationship with my mom.  My mom was too busy trying to pay the rent, keep food on the table and keep us in buster right, Buster Brown shoes, black and white shoes with the cute little socks folded socks here.  So we didn't talk.  She didn't talk.  I, I don't remember my mother as being affectionate.  She wasn't touchy, she didn't, she's a hard worker making certain we had everything that we had.  And then once I became an adult it's interesting just the reverse and now just so affectionate, cuddly, loving, wanting to talk you know.  Well baby let mama tell you what happened you know.  So she's not struggling as she had and so she feels more comfortable to just open up.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Now did you have favorite subjects in school?
Speaker 1: Yes, I loved math.  Loved math.  I loved math and I loved the arts.  Loved the arts.
Speaker 2: What particular art or--?
Speaker 1: Drama.  I love drama.  I love acting.
Story_ID: 296755
Speaker 1: Did you have opportunities to participate in drama in grade school?
Speaker 2: Yes I did.
Speaker 1: I mean wasn't until high school?
Speaker 2: Yes, I did.
Speaker 1: In grade school?
Speaker 2: Not in grade school.  Middle school [Hamilton Middle School, Memphis, Tennessee] I auditioned a couple of plays and did a couple of parts here and there but I was never given the lead or anything like that. Always in the chorus.  But in high school I joined an organization called 'An Evening of Soul' ['Roots, Rhymes & Righteous Times (An Evening of Soul),' Erma Clanton] and it was a play and it toured in the South with Erma Clanton [HistoryMaker Erma L. Clanton].
Speaker 1: Erma Clanton, right.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: We interviewed Erma Clanton.
Speaker 2: Are you serious?
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: Erma Clanton.
Speaker 1: 'An Evening of Soul' is a big deal.
Speaker 2: Big deal.  I was 'Evening of Soul's' mascot (laughter).  If you pull out old clippings of 'An Evening of Soul,' you will find skinny, tall me in the chorus and then eventually Erma gave me some parts and my working with Mrs. Clanton lifted my self-esteem to such a level.  And what happened all of the friends that I could not make and did not make while I was in grade school and in middle school, I made while I was in high school on the road.  So all of my friends were older than myself.  So I became friends with the older individuals who were entertainers who also attended Hamilton [High School, Memphis, Tennessee].
Speaker 1: Now can you give us some names of some people?
Speaker 2: Oh Greg Gaston, his last name is Gaston, Adriane Lenox who just won a Tony [Antoinette Perry Award for Excellence in Theatre] for a Broadway show.  The tall guy used to be a radio deejay, Gregory Seivers [ph.], is his name Greg Seivers, I think his name is Gregory Seivers, Reginald Gaston that was his name, that's his name, Reginald Gaston, just so many, so many.  And I know this wonderful singer who was so wonderful I can't think of her name now she was one of the lead singers in the show.  There's so many but that's what I did, I and what I did was I formed this relationship while I was in high school and Ms. Clanton was very kind to me and gave me little bits and pieces, little parts and after graduating high school and getting into Cornell [University, Ithaca, New York], I went to Cornell--.
Speaker 1: Now before--
Speaker 2: Not yet?
Speaker 1: --before we get you there--
Speaker 2: Okay, okay.
Speaker 1: --I just wanna ask you, so the theater in high school has really done a lot for your self-esteem and got--.
Speaker 2: Oh yes.
Speaker 1: But--.
Speaker 2: And it gave me an outlet.  It gave me an outlet, so I was not as loquacious any more.  I had a place to, to go and let loose.
Story_ID: 296756
Speaker 1: Now when you graduated [from Hamilton High School, Memphis, Tennessee] were you like one of the top students or did you--?
Speaker 2: I did well.  I applied to nineteen colleges and got into all of them, except for one.  That broke my heart.
Speaker 1: Which one?
Speaker 2: Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts].  Harvard.  And I was invited to reapply but my heart was broken, but I got into all the others.  The Ivy Leagues that I applied--all the other Ivy Leagues that I applied to all of the--I applied to a number of black colleges [HBCUs] I got into (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) How did you wind up choosing Cornell [University, Ithaca, New York]?
Speaker 2: Did some research.  Awesome, awesome school and my aunt [Jamela Franklin], my father's [J.D. Echols] sister was attending Cornell and I found it was an Ivy League and just one of the best--I went to their summer pre-med program, bio-med program one summer and fell in love with this huge beautiful campus and all the brilliance and I went, fell in love with it.  And I majored--I was pre-med.  I was going to go into medicine, that's what I wanted to do.  By my sophomore year, I realized I didn't want to do it.  I loved the arts.  I continued performing and doing things at Cornell.  As a matter of fact, Willard Straight Hall, the board of directors at Willard Straight Hall gave me a five thousand dollar grant to bring Erma Clanton [HistoryMaker Erna L. Clanton] to Cornell.  So I brought 'An Evening of Soul' ['Roots, Rhymes & Righteous Times (An Evening of Soul),' Erma Clanton] to Cornell University and they performed at Statler [Hall, Ithaca, New York] and it was unbelievable, unbelievable.  I was just I--it was unfortunate that I didn't run it for two nights.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: 'Cause it was (unclear).
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you started Cornell in what year was it?
Speaker 2: I graduated high school in '75 [1975]--
Speaker 1: Yeah so you must have started Cornell--
Speaker 2: Right, um-hm Cornell and I graduated Cornell undergraduate in '79 [1979].
Story_ID: 296757
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That must have really been something to have Erma Clanton [HistoryMaker Erma L. Clayton] and 'An Evening of Soul' ['Roots, Rhymes & Righteous Times (An Evening of Soul),' Erma Clanton] at Cornell [University, Ithaca, New York].
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: Now were you in 'An Evening of Soul' when [HistoryMaker] Isaac Hayes would make his cameo appearances?
Speaker 2: Yes.  And not only that but because of Ms. Clanton, Stax recording company [Stax Records, Memphis, Tennessee] I believe background singers, they were looking for background singers so I used to do some background vocals at Stax recording company with Mr. Hayes because of Erma Clanton so--
Speaker 1: So you're a decent singer then?
Speaker 2: I'm okay (laughter).  I'm okay. I'm all right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So it was one if you can tell it makes me smile.  It was a great experience, I just, I wouldn't trade it for anything in the world.
Story_ID: 296758
Speaker 1: What was your major at Cornell [University, Ithaca, New York]?
Speaker 2: Undergrad--undergraduate major was--
Speaker 1: Oh it's pre-med you said?
Speaker 2: --pre-med, um-hm.  Pre-med.  I wanted to go into medicine.  I wanted to be a surgeon and my sophomore, the end of my sophomore year I didn't wanna do that.  I said that's not what you wanna do.  And I just fell in love with the arts and I said I really wanna do the arts.  I really want to do the arts.  How can I do the arts and keep a science degree?  But I still wanted to have a science degree.  I want to keep the science degree.  I did not want to switch my major to drama in undergraduate.  I wanted to keep something that had it--this was my counselor's advice so you'll have something to fall back on if you change your mind.  So if you change your mind, you got your subjects under, under your belt.  So I changed to pre-med, I changed my major to psychology, a bio-psychology degree.
Speaker 1: Bio-psychology?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Primarily psychology.  With a combined science.
Speaker 1: You did know we were talking off camera about James Turner and that--
Speaker 2: Um-hm Professor Turner.
Speaker 1: --yeah.
Speaker 2: At the Africana studies department [Africana Studies and Research Center] and his wife [Janice Turner], she's also at the university.  She's in administration.  Yeah just some very wonderful people.  I met a number of professors there. Dr. Ben-Jochannan [HistoryMaker Yosef Ben-Jochannan], as a matter of fact I took his course and of course read his book, everyone must read his book--
Speaker 1: Which one?
Speaker 2: --regarding the slave trade ['Africa: Mother of Western Civilization,' Dr. Yosef A.A. ben-jochannan].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The slave trade, the red one.  So just learned a lot, a lot of brilliance.  I, I've been around a lot of wonderful people, they're definitely included, definitely.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 296759
Speaker 1: Any other teachers or mentors at Cornell [University, Ithaca, New York] that you want to mention?
Speaker 2: When we got to graduate--in graduate school yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I did a year of graduate school at Cornell as well.
Speaker 1: Who did you want to mention from--?
Speaker 2: Just their entire drama department.  They gave me a strength that is unmatched because they forced me to really look at myself and what it is I was doing if indeed this is what I wanted to do because after I graduated Cornell undergraduate, I applied to graduate--to one school I wanted to go to Cornell, their fine arts [Cornell Department of Art, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York].  I wanted to be in their fine arts and I had made a decision that I wanted to go into drama.  So no I applied to two.  I applied to Yale [University, New Haven, Connecticut], Yale drama school [Yale School of Drama, New Haven, Connecticut] and I applied to Cornell.  I wanted to go to one or the other.  I--.
Speaker 1: Yale drama school at the time [HistoryMaker] Lloyd Richards was there?
Speaker 2: That's right Lloyd Richards, I interviewed for--with him.  I got into Cornell.  I did not get into Yale, I got into--and now I know that that was supposed to happen that way because I know there would be no EYM [Educating Young Minds, Los Angeles, California] if I had gone to Yale.  I believe that with all my heart.  What happened at Cornell was because I went to undergraduate there, there was a family core, so I'm already a part of the family. So there are relationships that have already been established because when I was an undergraduate I supported the drama department.  I would go and see their plays, who is doing what. And what happened was at--the pieces that I got, the parts that were offered to me Pinte Selaya Fiestes [ph.] the Wicked Witch of something.  I was either a snake, crazy, or killing my children.  I was never just a normal person like a woman with a baby and a husband (laughter) and--I wouldn't--I was always some strange bird and I became very frustrated and there was another black actress, very talented young woman I remember being there and she got all the other parts like that.  And I remember when they gave me Pinte Selaya, I'm in this snake costume and I'm crawling across the floor.  I was frustrated and I was upset and I was unhappy.  And I tried to share with them that I was unhappy about the parts that I was having and, and I was in conflict with a couple of the professors and someone just brought it to my attention, one of the professors, you are not upset about the parts, you don't wanna be here.  This is not what you wanna do.  This is not your calling.  This is not what you want to do.  I remember my grades, my--that first year of graduate school, A's and Bs.  A's and Bs and they asked me to leave.  They asked me to go and find out what it is I wanted to do.
Speaker 1: Now were there any other black students from that drama department.
Speaker 2: Oh yes.  There was a black female the one I was sharing with you who got the other part.  But she was the ingenue, much shorter, very beautiful, attractive you know, definitely the part, had the look, and I have got to admit I was, I didn't know what a blessing that place was until recently until about five--about seven years ago.  As a matter of fact I've seen all of them again recently because they spoke when I received the outstanding--Cornell had an affair where they nominated the twenty-five most outstanding individuals of my class.  And I was one of the twenty-five in education and the only female black and I received that award and they came back and spoke on my behalf.  These, this is the dean of the school.  The professor, I'm sorry, one of the professors of the department.
Story_ID: 296760
Speaker 1: So you were taking a graduate course at Cornell [University, Ithaca, New York], we got you about 1976 or so I guess?  No, no, no this will be '80 [1980].
Speaker 2: No we're talking '80 [1980], '81 [1981] yes.
Speaker 1: Eighty [1980], '81 [1981].  Right.  Okay.  Now, so you decided to change your major from drama to--.
Speaker 2: And went on to graduate school in drama.
Speaker 1: In okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  And fell in love with it. After the first year, however, I was asked to not return.  It was a two year program, I only did one year.  And I was devastated and one of the professors reminded me.  He said, "Angeles [HistoryMaker Angeles Echols], it has nothing to do with ability, but it's obvious you don't want to be here."  And I moved.  I went to New York [New York], auditioned for 'The Wiz,' got it.  I was Glinda.  I played Glinda and the Good Witch and I played Auntie Em in 'The Wiz.'
Speaker 1: On Broadway?
Speaker 2: I did the truck, bus and truck tours.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No I was not on Broadway.  You know when they was on Broadway I was still in school, undergraduate [Cornell University, Ithaca, New York]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No this is years later, one of the bus and truck tours.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I did that and I started performing and auditioning in New York and doing a lot of performing.  And then trying to also model on the side for extra money.  And--.
Speaker 1: So your concept must be changing if you're modeling and you're, you're in plays and all that.
Speaker 2: Um-hm and teaching on the side.
Speaker 1: And teaching.
Speaker 2: I was teaching during the summer programs.  I taught in the Bronx [New York], Alexander Burger [I.S. 139, Bronx, New York] and some other schools.  I taught during the summers, taught the arts.  I tutored math and English in different places.  So when--I always taught school.  I was always teaching, always, or tutoring. And I continued to do that in New York City.
Story_ID: 296761
Speaker 1: I remember getting a role called 'Staggerlee,' directed and I believe written by Vernel Bagneris, I hope I'm not mispronouncing his name, but a wonderful director, a wonderful man.  He gave me an opportunity to do 'Staggerlee'.  I was one of the dancers.  And it was quite an experience and it was that performance, that performance told me that there was something else I was missing, that there's gotta be more.  This is not enough for me.
Speaker 2: What happened, why what happened?
Speaker 1: I was up for the understudy for the lead and I noticed I was rarely rehearsed and if anything ever happened to the lead, the show would close that night because I was not prepped and ready for that role.  And that was frightening and intimidating to me.  And also I felt unprofessional and unprofessional on my part and I felt maybe I should have been more aggressive in making certain that I practiced and prepared for that role, but I--it just didn't happen.  I had a couple of rehearsals and that was that.  And so I remembered the role that I did have I was dressed in this outfit and again I was--I looked like a snake and it reminded me of college [Cornell University, Ithaca, New York] and I was in this very skimpy outfit and I was dancing on the stage and crawling across the stage and I did that every night (laughter).  And I said oh, this reminds me--and I started praying and I said, "Okay Lord, what am I gonna do?  What am I supposed to do?"  And again I would teach on the side.  I would teach on the side and I just always found so much peace teaching.  Whenever I taught, I never questioned it.  There was never any doubt that that's what I was supposed to do.  Performing oh, a doubt, med school, oh a doubt, teaching, never a doubt, not one time.  Never looked back and regretted it.
Speaker 2: So what did you teach, were you a sub or did you have a--?
Speaker 1: During the--primarily during the summers.  There were summer programs where they had summer programs for children, workshops for children.  I remember at one school I was the director, I directed the 'West Side Story,' primarily Hispanic babies.  I was the director for that.  And I tutored the-tutored math and English in different places and then I would do one on one tutoring at homes for children.  And I just loved it.  I loved it.  But I did not know at that time that it would lead to this [Educating Young Minds, Los Angeles, California].  There was no connection.  None because I knew that I--well I said to myself once I was in New York [New York] I said okay I see what happened--regardless of what happened in graduate school and what happened in New York, I'm not getting the roles that I think I should be playing that I deserve.  I need to go to California.  I need to go to California and get into the situation, comedies and the drama pieces and I need--and get movies.  That's what I need to do.
Story_ID: 296762
Speaker 1: So what year was that when you decided to come out here [Los Angeles, California]?
Speaker 2: It was in the '80s [1980s], so we're talking mid-'80 [1980] between--I know it was between '86 [1986] and '88 [1988] it was between there.  Exactly when I'm not certain, but I did come out in the late '80s [1980s] and I auditioned for a movie with Robert Urich and Meredith Baxter-Birney [Meredith Baxter] 'She Knows Too Much,' and got the part.  And I was excited about the work but prior to getting that work, before I left New York [New York] I had called a friend, a wonderful lady who has, who had a television sitcom on the air and I asked her if I could come and stay with her. Share her home with her.  I told her I was coming out.  We were girlfriends.  I used to work with her in New York and she said yes.  And then while I was preparing to come out she told me she changed her mind.  When I came she said I could not stay with her.  So I was homeless.  I had no place to stay.
Speaker 1: And you hadn't really saved up enough money?
Speaker 2: I had five hundred dollars on me which wasn't gonna go far and I had no job.  So I called Georgia Webb [ph.] at Berkeley [University of California, Berkeley, Berkley, California] and I'm purposely not giving the other person's name because I don't think that's that important but I called Georgia Webb.  She wasn't at Berkeley at the time but she was my director.  She was my counselor at Cornell [University, Ithaca, New York] and she had moved out here and I called Georgia Webb and I told her I was homeless.  I didn't have a place to stay.  She was living in Pomona [California].  Her husband said no, she said yes.  So she won and I slept on their floor in the den and I was there for six months and there were many times he wanted to put me out and she wouldn't allow it.  And there were times when they were asleep I'd go in the refrigerator because I had no money, no food and you know when people have had dinner and you know once they've had dinner and they put it away neatly and everything and I'll go in and I'll get something and then I'll try and pat it back down and make it look as if nobody went in it and she always knew but she never said anything.  And she just was a good friend.  She's a good friend.
Speaker 1: So during this time were you trying to find (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I was still auditioning.
Speaker 1: Oh you were auditioning?
Speaker 2: Right.  I was auditioning.  I was auditioning for various roles.
Story_ID: 296763
Speaker 1: When I was with her [Echols' friend, Georgia Webb (ph.)] there's a part I didn't mention--I mention prior to coming to New York [New York] I was working in French Lick, Indiana, at this resort [French Lick Resort] in French Lick.
Speaker 2: That's the home of Larry Bird.
Speaker 1: Larry Bird, that's right.  I used to work there and so when I got to, to L.A. [Los Angeles, California] I remember her saying you know, "Aren't you in Indiana?"  I said, "No I got back to L.A.--back to New York and now I'm here."  And blase, blase, blase happened, I don't have a place to stay.  Anyway so they took me.  She took me in and I was there for about six months. And I auditioned off and on and sometimes--excuse me--they would like be away or out of town or something like that and sometimes I'd be in Los Angeles at an audition and I couldn't get back to Pomona [California].  I couldn't get back because I didn't have enough money and the bus, sometimes the bus drivers would let me on and sometimes they wouldn't and I remember sitting on the corner of Spring [Street] and Temple [Street] sometime at two and three o'clock in the morning and I would sit up just like this and I'd cross my, my, my feet at the ankles and try and, and look like a lady so nobody would assume that I was a prostitute or a lady of the streets or the evening.  And, and I would do that when a bus would come, I'd get on and I'd let him know that I was short and sometimes somebody would let me on and sometimes they wouldn't and I just keep doing that until I get on the bus.  And so I did that off and on--I did that for six months.  Then I remember during that period of time I applied for--I auditioned for a movie and I got that movie, the movie I just mentioned earlier with Robert Urich, the late Robert Urich and Meredith Baxter-Birney [Meredith Baxter], it's called 'She Knows Too Much' and I played a jailbird.  I was in prison.  Then I got another part and I was a prostitute.  And then I got another part, another piece and I was something weird of course.  But it was always, just seemed negative, all the parts were negative.  All the parts were degrading.  And I would audition for plays and it just became very negative for me and I was not happy on the stage.  I was--I did '[The] Colored Museum' [George C. Wolfe], beautiful piece.
Speaker 2: Where was that done?
Speaker 1: I did that in San Diego [California] at the beautiful theater [San Diego Repertory Theatre] in San Diego.  Did not enjoy it.  Did not enjoy it.  Did not make any friends.  The movie same thing.  Did not, did not make any friends and it kept happening and it kept happening and I'd go to these auditions and I prayed.  I remember I said, "God I can't do this.  You gotta talk to me.  God you're trying to tell me something.  You've been trying to tell me a long time and I want you to know that I'm ready to listen now.  What is it that I am supposed to do?"
Story_ID: 296764
Speaker 1: And what happened a couple of weeks after this this feverish prayer I got an apartment at 914 South Wilton [Place] in Los Angeles [California].  I got a one room apartment and down the street was a church called the Trinity Lutheran School [Trinity Lutheran Church, Los Angeles, California], they had a church and a school.  I went there and applied for a teaching position and I was offered a full time teaching position.  And then an associate of mine, a very nice man, an actor as well, Willard Pugh [Willard E. Pugh] it was like he played Harpo in 'The Color Purple' in the movie.  He told me about a teaching position at Chaffey College [Rancho Cucamonga, California] in San Bernardino [sic.].  He said look I can help you out.  I got a--there's a possibility I can hook you up with the professor and you can get a teaching position there and it pays really good money per hour.  It won't be a lot of hours.  So between the two, I was auditioning, teaching at Chaffey College in San Bernardino and teaching at Trinity Lutheran School.  So that's what I did, and the teaching just continued to grow and grow, and grow, the teaching experience.  And one evening Mrs. Osay [ph.], she's from Ghana, she and a couple of parents came to me and asked if I would tutor their kids after school to help them because their kids were behind, different kids were behind and she was one of the parents who approached me.  But I knew to do this, to tutor and to start that, it would impose upon in terms on my acting career and I knew I wasn't happy there.  So I prayed again and I started tutoring kids in my apartment.  I started tutoring and I--.
Speaker 2: Now what year is this?
Speaker 1: This is about two years after getting there so we're talking now '88 [1988].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Eighty-eight [1988] um-hm.  Around '88 [1988], I started tutoring kids in my one room apartment at 914 South Wilton. And one kid led to two, two led to three, to four and it grew and it grew, and pretty soon I had kids who'd take their pillows off the bed and put in--Terry [ph.] used to take her pillow off, off my bed and put it in the bathtub and she'd study in the bathtub.  Tiffani [ph.] used to take the pillow and put it on the toilet seat and she'd sit on the toilet seat because I ran out of space in this one and a half room apartment.  I didn't have it.  And I used--the parents wouldn't pick them up until around eight, eight-thirty, and so I would make them dinner.  I only had a couple of dollars but I made them dinner.  I would take hotdogs and cut it up and put onions and ketchup in it with some beans, pork and beans and that would be dinner with some bread.  I made spaghetti, and it just grew. And one evening I asked God to give me a sign and to let me know what it was I was supposed to do.  Lord if I'm supposed to be in the arts, let me know.  If I'm supposed to teach, if this is what I'm supposed to do, let me know and what happened all of the parents chipped in together, I wanted to go home for Christmas to Memphis [Tennessee].  I didn't have enough money.  They all chipped in and got me a plane fare, paid for a ticket to Memphis.  I got bumped to first class, sat next to a millionaire, told him about what I was doing.  He said, "I don't believe you are a math instructor."  He gave me a problem.  He was from Atlanta [Georgia].  He gave me a problem to do, a math problem using the Varadarajan theorem.  Now you don't walk around using the Varadarajan theorem.  I did the problem, I did it correctly. He said, "Okay you are a math teacher."  I said, "Yes."  I said, "Now I have a proposition for you.  I am working with kids in my apartment and it's too small.  I need a space."  And at that point I had been in my apartment tutoring for about four and a half years, four and a half, five years.  He--three months later, he came to Los Angeles, met the kids, saw me in this apartment and helped me get a space at night at Wilton, 3400 West 6th Street and I was in there with the tutorial program for about thirteen years.  That's how I moved into that space.
Speaker 2: Can you give us his name?
Speaker 1: Oh I cannot remember his name.  It'll come to me, it'll come to me.  I can't remember.  He's in Atlanta.  Oh I can't remember now but it'll come to me.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: He, so he was extremely instrumental in that move.
Story_ID: 296765
Speaker 1: And then what happened, one thing led to another that led to another, that led to another and it told me this is what I was just supposed to do.  One evening I was standing outside the door outside of the building outside of my office where I tutor and it was--I was the only teacher, I had about maybe what fifteen kids then. And this attorney, a Mr. Adrian Bocka [ph.] walked by.  "What do you do here?"  And I told him.  And we started talking.  Then I visited his office down the hall and he said, "This is what you need.  You need the purple handbook.  Get the purple handbook, study that purple handbook, write your articles of incorporation and your bylaws.  You need to go nonprofit.  Get you a name and go for it."  An attorney.  He said, "Once you have written it you give it to me and I'll review it and help you with it."
Speaker 2: So what year is this?  This is same year or--?
Speaker 1: This is a little later so this is a couple of years down the line.
Speaker 2: This about 1990 or so?
Speaker 1: Yes around '90 [1990] or so um-hm.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And we became incorporated [as Educating Young Minds, Los Angeles, California] and I did, I wrote the articles of incorporation, I studied that handbook, took it to him, and there was some other people who were instrumental and helpful in terms of getting that done quickly and professionally so that I would be taken seriously.  And inside that building, we went from 300 square feet of space to 800 square feet of space to 1100 square feet of space to 2000 square feet of space to 4000 square feet of space over twelve, thirteen years.  And it just grew and I would add one teacher, then two teachers, then three teachers and I learned the ropes.  I met a lot of people and that's when a number of wonderful funders came into my life.  Samuel Goldwyn [Jr.] has been supporting this program, and a wonderful man from who used to be the director of A Better Chance [ABC] here, Michael [W.] Anderson, he's no longer with them.  Michael Anderson introduced me to Samuel Goldwyn of MGM [Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios Inc., Los Angeles, California], of the studios and it just grew from there.  And I stopped acting.  And I had stopped, I didn't look back.
Story_ID: 296766
Speaker 1: Tell me now what--do you employ a particular educational philosophy or, or method you know to get the results you get [at Educating Young Minds, Los Angeles, California]. You're getting pretty good results from what I've read, so--.  And where--well there's a lot of questions. Yeah what method do you employ?
Speaker 2: Everyone involved must be held accountable.  There are consequences to actions.  That's the parent, the child, me, my staff, everybody is held accountable so whatever your job is, whatever it is you are supposed to do that's what the expectation is, that's what I'm expecting from you.  And I share that, I preach that.  The parents must be involved.  Either the parents, the guardian and if the child is adopted, I'm sorry not adopted, but if the child is in a shelter or has a guardian, then that guardian is responsible.  The responsibility and structure and consistency and letting kids know what it is you want of them.  They don't have to guess, no.  You know right and wrong.  There's no guess.  This is what you are supposed to do.  And I share with parents all of the time and I think what's worked for me is I share with them I have no interest in being your friend.  I don't care to be your buddy.  I only care about that child.  So if you and I don't work, this won't work.  I never remove kids from the program.  I remove parents.  I will remove a parent not the kid.  So my overall philosophy is we're all held accountable and there are expectations and we must all say the same thing.  When that child leaves this environment and goes home, that parent is saying the same thing we say here.  So when that child wants to test the waters and venture out maybe try a little drugs, try a little sex, try gangs, maybe tip here, tip there.  Wherever that child goes--wherever that child--the direction that child goes in, there are adults saying the same thing, giving them the same love, giving him, her the same love.  The same, the same lesson. We're all saying the same thing.  And eventually it sinks in.
Story_ID: 296767
Speaker 1: How do you recruit students [to Educating Young Minds, Los Angeles, California], I mean how are they--?
Speaker 2: All by word of mouth.  Usually there have been a number, a number of awards we have received and one is in the papers.  When the L.A. Times [Los Angeles Times] did an article.  When it's in the papers, when it's on the radio, I do the--I've done several on the radio shows.  A couple of them I think comes at four or five o'clock in the morning, I can't remember the name of it but when they hear me, when I received the unsung hero award, they'll call in, but ninety percent are by word of mouth.  Few will come through the phone book but most are by word of mouth and I mean we have a waiting list of about 165.  There's people trying to get in.  I interviewed thirty-five this--two Saturdays ago for ten seats.
Speaker 1: Okay and so is there a profile of who you typically get or?
Speaker 2: A child in need, period.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So it doesn't matter if their parents have a whole lot of money or little money or?
Speaker 2: Doesn't matter.
Speaker 1: Don't have any (simultaneous)--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I've taken a kid whose mother was a millionaire and I've taken a kid whose mother is a drug addict and at the gala last year she stood on stage and said I am an addict.  And I don't want my son.  I've got a parent who lives--was living downtown [Los Angeles, California] in a Volkswagen with five kids.  Now if you line all these babies up against the wall in this room right now, you won't know which child comes from which family.  Right now around it's what eight thirty, you've got about seventy-some kids left in this program, can you tell?  Are they running through this center?  You can't tell.  There are seventy-something kids in here right now at 8:30 and more than 65 percent are boys.  Teenagers, and you can't tell.
Story_ID: 296768
Speaker 1: What's your success rate?  You've talked about like (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) We have--
Speaker 1: --a lot of the students go to college?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  We have 100 percent high school graduation rate.  We have a 89.9 percent four year collegiate graduation rate.  The two kids I mentioned Terra [ph.] who used to study in the bathtub with the pillow, she graduated from Stanford [Stanford University, Stanford, California] three years ago.  Took the LSAT, the law school exam I believe.  Scored in the 98 percentile.  Tiffani [ph.], the one who took the pillow and she studied, put my pillow, she would take my pillow and put it on the toilet seat to sit on the seat, she's at Dillard [Dillard University, New Orleans, Louisiana], well until the flood [Hurricane Katrina] of course.  She was at Dillard, she's now at Clark [Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia].  We do well.  We do very, very well.  But I think that's because of the structure and the consistency and we're a part of that child's life until they're twenty-one, they graduate college.  And the entire premise of the program [Educating Young Minds, Los Angeles, California], is your child must be college bound.  If you want your child just to get a high school diploma and get a job, this is not the place for you.
Story_ID: 296769
Speaker 1: Have you ever had a challenging child that really didn't seem like they were responding to the program [Educating Young Minds, Los Angeles, California]?
Speaker 2: Oh of course, you'll get kids who don't respond, but you just don't give up.  We just don't give up.  When ninety percent of the time, when kids are removed, if they're removed from this program, it's because we've asked them to leave and it's usually because of the parent.  Example, wonderful young man.  As a matter of fact, I'm looking forward to calling him because I want to--I'm going to give him a college scholarship even though he's not in this program.  I've put aside five thousand dollars for this kid for college.  But I had to remove he and his mother from the program and that's because this child came to us with Fs and Ds and a serious very negative attitude.  So what we did, we took him out of the huge system, put him in a smaller system and home schooled him so he was with us every day from nine o'clock to four o'clock in the morning--nine o'clock to four o'clock in the evening, afternoon, I'm sorry.  And we had finished the semester.  His grades were A's and Bs okay.  Mom came to me because this child was coming to me as well saying, "Ms. Echols [HistoryMaker Angeles Echols], can I go back to the regular school now, I miss my friends.  I wanna go back."  I said, "No, you've got to complete the year.  You must complete the year and we need the grades.  We need the grades to bring your cum [cumulative grade point average] up so no you're gonna stay in home schooling.  At least get the grades, and we need to keep working on your attitude right?"  Mom came to me couple of weeks later and told me she was pulling him out of home schooling, putting him back into the system and she wanted him to come to this program after school.  And I said no.  Absolutely not.  She said you're putting my kid out.  I said no, I'm putting you out.  Because we've already discussed this.  For you to allow this child to run this, it's wrong.  You're giving him too much power and you're asking me to accept that power in this space?  I said it won't happen.  I put them out.  So she was not very happy with me.  But I still love her and I'm gonna give him five thousand dollars for college.  But the situations like that, like I'll have situations where I've got black mothers raising boys and they're too close.  It's very difficult for us to make men out of boys as a woman.  It is difficult.  We need men.  And so some women have them too close, too close.  And they need to push back a little.  And, and find some uncles, some, find somebody you know.  Find mentors.  So I'm an advocate for that.
Speaker 1: Scenario you see a lot these days our women raising our children themselves and--.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, boys.
Speaker 1: Right even grandmothers raising them.  I know of one case, a great-grandmother raising.
Speaker 2: Yes and I get a lot of calls from grandmamas raising babies.
Story_ID: 296770
Speaker 1: Your work [through Educating Young Minds, Los Angeles, California] has garnered a lot of recognition, I know that much. And it takes a lot of money to do this at this level.
Speaker 2: It does.
Speaker 1: You said people expect to find a little, a little Negro storefront or something.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: But this is not that.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: This is a facility, we're on Wilshire Boulevard.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: On the fourth floor of a--this is like an executive suite, carpeted, leather covered chairs, computer--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --computer room--
Speaker 2: State of the art.
Speaker 1: --state of the art--
Speaker 2: Equipment.
Speaker 1: --equipment, art work even.
Speaker 2: Very classy artwork.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: That's right.  Cost a lot of money to maintain this kind of (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It does.
Speaker 1: And how many students do you have?
Speaker 2: We have 227 registered and another forty-seven in colleges that we give six to ten thousand dollars to and a hundred plus on the waiting list.
Speaker 1: Now do you take them on a college tour?
Speaker 2: We don't do that.  College tours we don't do.  What we do is refer them to--there are a lot of programs that do that, that do the college tours.  We are heavy, heavy, 190 percent academics.  English, math, phonics, calculus, statistics, trigonometry, grammar, ESL [English as a Second Language], the babies who cannot read coming in in the ninth and tenth grade cannot read, teaching them how to read.  And what's so interesting you understand, we gotta teach them how to read and at the same time teach and tutor them in their ninth and tenth grade subjects.
Story_ID: 296771
Speaker 1: One thing I noticed when we were setting up and throughout the evening is that I see groups of children are actually working together and quietly working together on what seems to be academic projects--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --but there's no, nobody's hitting anyone or pulling anybody's hair or--
Speaker 2: Swearing and fighting.
Speaker 1: --destroying the computers--
Speaker 2: Or writing on the desks.
Speaker 1: --writing on the desk.
Speaker 2: Graffiti.
Speaker 1: I don't see this.  Now how is this possible in the days of the world you know?  When you say that some of the kids actually had come out of the background where they don't have a lot of support.  The parents are not there.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  I can best give you an example by sharing this story with you, something that happened last year.  We took in a new family and this family had about three boys, has about three boys and we took this family in, all of the boys.  And one of the boys, not gang--he's gang affiliate, affiliated.  He says he's not a member, has not been a member.
Speaker 1: That means?
Speaker 2: But his friends are and--.
Speaker 1: Maybe he lives in a neighborhood where everybody's in a gang?
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: So it's hard (simultaneous)--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) But I know for a fact it's more than that.  As a matter of fact I know it's more than that.  I ran an ABP [all-points bulletin] on this young man and so it was definitely more than that.  But I'm respecting what he's telling me and he wants to be in the program.  This is the oldest boy.  And two really good parents, good people, hardworking individuals.  And this young man I took into the program and what he did, well one evening we came into the program and this had never--we just saw--we started seeing graffiti in the bathroom stalls on the insides and before I knew it it's graffiti all over the place, the stalls, the entire place.   Now in fifteen years of running EYM [Educating Young Minds, Los Angeles, California] it had never happened like that.  This was inside the bathroom so I knew it would go from the bathroom to the space but I also knew that one of the instigators, someone who is doing this in terms of the lead guy was a newer guy.  It was not a guy who has been here for two, three, four and five years.  So, I went to all--I pulled all of the guys, all of the guys in the program if they weren't here, I called them at their homes and told them they had to come in today.  I called them all in.  I put them, I packed my office in the hall with all of the boys in the program and I put them all out.  I said this will be a program for girls.  All of you are out.  Because there is graffiti in that bathroom, there's a lot of tagging and you guys have been answering one another.  I wanna know who it is.  You got until nine o'clock to tell me who it is or all of you pack your mess and get out and call your mamas and daddies to come and get you.  That's what I did.  Nine o'clock came, everybody they didn't know.  "Oh Ms. Echols [HistoryMaker Angeles Echols], I don't and I wouldn't do that," and da, da, da, da, right.  One of my other kids came in who was a little late but he came in and I said, "Well pack your things you may as well go home because everybody is going home."  So I sent everybody to the phone, "Call your folks you're out of here.  I'm putting all of you out."  One kid, Jason [ph.], stood up and said--remember I just called the young guy Jason in the hall, I was speaking to him--Jason stood up and said, "I'll be a senior in two years.  You're not kicking me out of this program.  I'm, I'm going to Daniel Murphy [Daniel Murphy High School, Los Angeles, California]. I gotta get my scholarship, my mother would kill me," right.  So he said, "Unh-uh, Ms. Echols I don't do graffiti.  I don't hang with the guys who do it.  If I knew who did it, I'd tell you right."  And then it just started a chain reaction right.  Everybody starts talking right.  And then this one kid stood up and he said, "Ms. Echols, I know who did it," blase, blase, blase did it.  I called blase, blase, blase on the phone 'cause he hadn't gotten there yet.  Took him into the bathroom.  "Did you do this?"  He said, "Yes, Ms. Echols.  Yes I did it."  "Okay."  "Ms. Echols, I'm sorry."  So we went through all that.  He's boo hooing, I'm boo hooing.  I said, "Who's answering you?  I want to know the taggers.  Who's responding to you?"  And he dropped the names just like that.
Story_ID: 296772
Speaker 1: And the kids whose names who he dropped were two of the boys in the meeting who swore up and down they had nothing to do with it.  I put them out.  I put them out.  I made them examples.  Their parents called me for meetings, the boys called.  The next day they came with their moms and their dads with all the graffiti removal stuff, made the bathroom spotless.  Got rid of all of it.  All of it.  I had the one boy who I know was in and out in terms of testing this whole gang situation, I had him to write me three months of letters in terms of what's been going on with him, his life sign.  I had him to write down, I had him to make finger signs of all the gang signs and get a camera and take pictures of those signs so that I would know them and I could learn them.  He taught me the gang signs.  He taught me the neighborhoods.  I said, "This is the only way you're gonna get back into this program [Educating Young Minds, Los Angeles, California] young man," and he wrote me letters and he has to check in with me every week, he had to check in.  He's here now.  The others, I put some of the other kids out because they knew who did it and wouldn't tell me.  So I put them out permanently.  I said, "You're a bigger threat to me than he is because you're supposed to have my back.  I've got yours.  I'm your friend," and one by one their stories.  I said, "Look, I was with you and your mom when you got put out.  Well who came and got you?  Who fed you?  Who picked you up and took you to dinner at Marie Callender's on Wilshire [Boulevard] and La Brea [Avenue] and we had ice cream and cake and ate just like we were crazy and we said we'll worry about where we're gonna live later.  Let's eat.  And, and I don't deserve that respect?"  And before you knew it everybody was breaking down telling me what happened, how it happened.  Haven't had the problem since.
Story_ID: 296773
Speaker 1: They have their desks [at Educating Young Minds, Los Angeles, California]; they have 145, 165 dollar desks here that Albertsons, Savons [Savon Pharmacy] did or purchased.  No, I think it was, no it was Savons, Savons purchased these desks.  So now when new kids come in, the older kids train them.  They say no man you can't mess up our space man, no this is our home.  No man don't steal the movies.  I go and buy the best--when they finish a lot of them are here until 9, 9:30, 10:00.  Sometimes the parents are late and they'll bring dinner, have dinner in the kitchen.  So I get movies for them 'cause I don't like television.  They can't watch television, but they can watch movies.  So I get the movies that they like and they'll watch movies.  And then I remember last month this new--one of the new kids 'cause we just took in seventy-five new kids this past summer, one of the new kids you know tried to you know cop one of the movies.  And one of the old kids said, "Yo man, we--you stealing from yourself."  "This belongs to us man."  "We don't steal from one another, put that back man."  "Awe man I was kidding, I was just kidding."  And how do I know?  Because we have cameras all over the place.  I spent eleven thousand dollars on a camera system so I literally leave her and go and look at tapes of what happened when I wasn't here.  What's happen--happening in my classroom, what my twenty-one teachers are doing?  Who's teaching and who is not.   Who nods, who does not and I'll call my meetings.  It's time to have a meeting.  "Why did blase, why was this happening guys in that classroom when the teacher's back was to the class?"  "Oh Ms. Echols [HistoryMaker Angeles Echols], we were talking about that movie because he tried to take that movie," and da, da, da.  That's how I find out 'cause they tell me.  So the answer to your question is I talk to them.  We talk to them and then we train our teachers to not only be a teacher, but be a friend to these kids.  They don't need anybody else doing this to them.  The cold, sterile environments at their schools, they don't need that.  There's nothing warm about them.  There's nothing warm about those buildings.  Nobody wants to sit at a desk and all they read is fuck you, your mama's a--that's what's on those desks.  Nobody wants that.  The halls, the dirt, the smell, the, the kids, the lockers, disrespecting themselves, girls disrespecting themselves.  We've gotta be honest and we gotta talk to them and we gotta let them know that they do have other options, that they have choices.

Speaker 1: One of my babies from college she's, when she came into the program [Educating Young Minds, Los Angeles, California] they told her she was special ed [special education].  Her mom brought her to me and they told her that she needed an IPE [sic. IEP, Individualized Education Program], that she was very slow, they didn't think she was gonna blase, do well, blase, blase, blase.  We tested this child--and my staff and myself also we've, we've taken on a clinical, a licensed clinical social worker to help work with these kids as well.  And after testing this baby, there's nothing wrong with this baby.  You know she won't move as quickly as some of the others, but there's nothing wrong with her.  And this was five years ago.  She's in college.  And if we had listened to those papers, she would have been in IEP classes with kids who really are, who really do have a problem, have learning disabilities.  She didn't have one.  She's now in college and she called me the other day--  I, I may have mentioned this earlier, to invite me to Greece.  She's doing--they're doing a student exchange from her college and she's going to Greece, Venice [Italy] and she invited me to join her for a week.  She'll be there for six months.  So I'm gonna go to Greece and hang out with one of my kids.  I hung out in upstate Los Angeles [California] with another college student.  I go to the college graduations.  So I got babies coming--this coming year I've got babies coming out of Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.], Stanford [Stanford University, Stanford, California], USC [University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California], as a matter of fact I'm trying to put two of my babies this year into Cornell [Cornell University, Ithaca, New York] and Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts].  And I got babies in Hampton [Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia], Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia].  For some reason all my black boys wanna go to Morehouse.  All my guys wanna go to Morehouse, but Morehouse you name it, Lincoln.

Speaker 1: The thing that what has made it work for me with this program [Educating Young Minds, Los Angeles, California], is I have been able to be low key.  I have been able--I have been allowed to do my thing.  So I have not chased the dollars.  I personally live in the same apartment I lived in when I tutored because I knew I couldn't buy me a million dollar home and build a million dollar center so I live in the same place and don't think I don't want a fancy house okay.  This suit is so old.  This is a Donna Karan I bought ten years ago, nine or ten years ago.  This suit so old I think I burned, it's got holes in it somewhere where I burned it somewhere around here in the back I've got brown spots where I burned a hole in the--trying to steam it and iron it because I couldn't afford to put it in the cleaners.  As a matter of fact, there were two other awards that I have won; I wore the same suit and the same shawl.  Other television tapings you'll see me in the same outfit.  But I knew that I could not do that with me and move the center the way I wanted to move it.  And so I told God that you know if you show me what it is I'm supposed to do I will do it and I'll do it right.  And it'll be first class.  And I will help as many babies as I can.  And I tell parents all the time, understand something.  I care nothing about you.  I don't care anything about you.  I don't care to be your friend.  I only care about that child.  And what happens when I focus on the child, then the parents love me.  Because of the love I give to their child.  It happens automatically.  I think education should be as accessible as a Big Mac and if I could open these nationwide, if I had Bill Gates' and Oprah's [Oprah Winfrey] money, I would go to [U.S.] Congress and you can make money work for you, wouldn't cost them anything.  But I'd take that money.  Bill Gates gave a hundred million dollars to a program recently, maybe it was the district, but he gave a large sum and which is very wonderful. But if I had their kind of power, as an educator, I wouldn't give the money the way they give it.  You see I think that a law should be changed.  They've got to be changed at the top and I think education, educators should have the same respect as doctors and hospitals.  Treat a school the way you treat a hospital in terms of education, make it synonymous with being--with a hospital being sterile.
Story_ID: 296776
Speaker 1: Are you close to opening another site?
Speaker 2: We've been, we've been asked to open one in Inglewood [California].  It would cost us--we would need at least 860,000 [dollars] just to be comfortable for two years and that's only for 125 kids.  For 825,000 [dollars]--we need two years to become solvent and to find other monies.
Speaker 1: Now do you have like (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And the problems are nobody wants to write the check.  They want the problem solved.  So I was invited to go and move into a place for a dollar a month, but everything else was on me.  So I would get the rent.  And I was supposed to be excited about that.  Absolutely not.  I tell you what, you give me the money and I'll find the place and pay my own rent.  But no and I made the calls.  I've had people make calls for me and I just haven't found anything that'll make it work because it has to have teachers and my teachers must be paid.  People wanna give me a place for a dollar that's run down so I would need to put at least eighty-five thousand dollars in it to make it comfortable okay.  That's the first thing I would have to do.  This, this suite that you're in now, there was twenty-one small offices.  I literally knocked down every wall in here.  This became one huge hollow space and then it was designed.  That wall behind you was pushed back.  The wall behind me was pushed forward.
Speaker 1: How much does that cost?
Speaker 2: Eighty-five thousand [dollars] just for the renovation.  And then what we did, just spent money on and raising money on colors and equipment and making certain that kids had computers that worked you know.  A lot of people would call me in the past and, and donate old computers you know, hand-me-downs.  I don't take them anymore.  I won't take 'em.  I saw schools and programs, there are schools and programs, there's one in Cerritos [California], there's an Asian program and it's wonderful.  In a library.  You should see it.  I've seen places where these kids after school have individual computer labs and then there are wall to wall, wall to wall aquariums.  I walked into one, there's a wall to wall aquarium and a spiral glass staircase.  And yet people walk into that kind of facility in a poor neighborhood and the question is where are you getting the money from?  Why are you doing it?  It's not fair.  Because if you give and teach kid grace and quality and faith and class and let them know they can have it that they can go to school and be anybody they wanna be and do anything they wanna do and then be able to reach back and help somebody else, if you give them that.  Don't just tell them.  You gotta give it to them.  They gotta see it.  They gotta live it.  Otherwise the kids will tell you you fronting, don't wanna hear it.  And the kids will tell you.  That's why that expression keep it real.  You've gotta show them.   You gotta give it to them.  And that's what we did, we give it to them.  I don't ask anything of them that I would not ask of myself or my own child and every child or any child I take into this program [Educating Young Minds, Los Angeles, California], I'd take a bullet for and I've had enough kids shot.  There's a picture right outside my office, one of my college babies was shot standing in the front yard and they said the bullet came over just an inch, she--we would have lost her.  This is a baby wouldn't have hurt a--she's now a junior in college.  So she came by a couple of weeks ago.  She worked for the summer here, got her award.  But we have to be aggressive and assertive in what we say and share with our kids and what we give them.
Story_ID: 296777
Speaker 1: Let me ask you, now you have answered this on some level already, but we're compelled to ask this question.  But what are some of your hopes and concerns for the black community at large at this juncture?
Speaker 2: We gotta stop competing.  When I created this center, I did it because there wasn't another one.  There wasn't a place where a child could get home study, afterschool tutorial, Saturday prep, remedial, with or without money, and then get a college scholarship and be college bound.  It did not exist.  So when this program [Educating Young Minds (EYM), Los Angeles, California] was created, I said okay, let's put something together where we can really work and help some more babies.  And that came after having tutored them in my apartment.  What we do in our communities now is we keep going after the same two dollars.  I receive phone calls every other day.  Somebody wants to put up a college scholarship program.  What for?  I got a phone call from a young man the other day and I don't want to call his name not to disrespect him, but asking for help.  "Well Ms. Echols [HistoryMaker Angeles Echols], we're doing our second annual college scholarship gala and we'd like for you to be on the committee and maybe sell two tables 'cause we'd like to give away about 1,500 [dollars] per child."  Why not let's join forces so we can give away $40,000 per child."  Why can't we join forces and really build something?  Do you know that all of the grassroots programs out here and all of the money that's out there, what we're capable of doing?  Do you know if we all pitched in together and created one voice, we could change the entire educational component in this country if we only came together?  [U.S.] Congress listens to votes.  It's about votes and money.  Power.  If we came together.  I had people calling me who wanted to put up a EYM center in Las Vegas [Nevada], but they didn't want to call it EYM.  So they wanted to take me out at dinner and they wanted my entire--my outline to see how I did this so they could do one in Vegas.  And she's gonna name it after her mother.  It's a mentality.  It's--right now I'm looking to collaborate.  I'm looking to collaborate with organizations or people that I think can move.  I'm meeting with a couple of them next week.  I've been interviewing.  People have invited me to open centers, other places but there's no funding.  They have no idea where funding is gonna come from.  And not only that, but they really don't care.  Because you're gonna have to give up to make it work.  You're gonna have to give it up.  And I, I gave it up.  I from personal and professional, I made choices and I don't regret any of it.  I wouldn't replace this with anything.  I got babies who are coming out of colleges and I believe deep in my heart and spirit that if that baby wasn't in EYM after school, he'd be dead and I can drop some names.  I can--you can't replace that with anything in the world.  My babies all come back and they tell me they're gonna buy me a Mercedes [Mercedes-Benz].  "Well Ms. Echols, when I become executive director of CBS--," whatever of CBS or Coca-Cola, "get you a Mercedes."  And I said, "Just make sure it's the biggest one and loaded you know.  Give me the best now."  But that's what I am, I am saying.
Story_ID: 296778
Speaker 1: Is there--I know there's an academic component--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and to some extent--I mean I can see that there is a cultural dimension in this too--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --but is there, is there a, is there a clear cultural component of what you do, what you're trying to impart in terms of--.
Speaker 2: If it is I couldn't define it.  Because my kids [at Educating Young Minds, Los Angeles, California] are black, white, Hispanic.  One of my young men that I absolutely love he's Hispanic and I've had him, I had him two years ago for about a year and a half.  Mom couldn't get him to me.  He's in gangs.  She called me last month.  "Ms. Echols [HistoryMaker Angeles Echols], help me save my baby."  He came to see me last week and I asked him what was going on and he said, "Ms. Echols, it's just ain't much to do and you know I can't read."  He's in the tenth grade.  He's a young a Hispanic kid and he can't read and his mother wants to home school him, but now the L.A. Unified School District [Los Angeles Unified School District] will not homeschool a kid who is behind.  Can you understand that?  They will not--you could not--if you have an IEP [Individualized Education Program] or you cannot pass their test, they will not home school you.  So he's literally floundering.  So he came to me and said, "Ms. Echols, can I come back into the program?"  So I gave him some ground work and some criteria and also I checked his eyes.  A physician friend of mine told me how to check for drugs with kids.  You can do it without you know any heavy--it's easy to tell and I could tell he was on drugs.  He was shooting, he was doing it.  And so I pulled him into the office just the two of us because I didn't know what his mother knew.  So I pulled him into the office alone and I told him, I said, "You gangbanging and you doing drugs and you want me to take you."  And he said, "Ms. Echols, please."  And so I gave him a list of things.  He said, "Yes I am."  He admitted it.  He said--I said, "This is what I need you to do.  And if you can come back to me seven weeks with that report and that report from the doctor, I'll take you.  But let me see what you gonna do."  So I'm waiting.  So culturally I don't know.  Parents come in who don't speak English.  I get a translator and we're at it (laughter).  I, I, I used to believe that it was but I don't any more.  It's hard, it's intent, it's spirit, it's faith, it's a calling.  I don't think it's just cultural.  It didn't matter.   The kid of mine downstairs, one of my kids whose parents own their own business, he has a little car, senior too, Parker [ph.] too nice kid, white kid.  This kid comes through the parking lot yester- last Monday and the guy told him he couldn't park there.  So he gets an attitude and the guy, the owner of the parking garage just bought a 19--I'm sorry a 2005 custom made, had it custom sports BMW, the sport coupe okay so we're talking fifty-six thousand [dollars].  The kid took his key and went across the hood of this guy's car because he didn't like what he said or the way he talked to him.  'Cause nobody talks to him like that.  I said, "Why 'cause you a little rich white kid?"  He said, "Oh Ms. Echols don't go there."  The guy called the police.  I wasn't here.  I was at a meeting.  They called me and pulled me out told me what was happening.  I canceled that meeting and shot straight over.  I talked to Sayeed [ph.], the owner of the parking lot.  I talked to my kid and this is a straight A kid and I said, "Parker why did you do that?"  He talked to me, "Ms. Echols I just got angry.  I didn't like the way he talked to me."  I said, "So you gonna damage his property?"  I said, "So he had a right to do whatever he wanted to do to you then?  Is that okay Parker?"  I said, "Parker, something happened within our family.  I didn't like the way something went down.  Should I have caused harm to one of your family members?  To your brother because I didn't like the way your brother spoke to me when he was in the program and I had to put him in check?  Should I have punched him in the face, Parker?  Should I have messed up his car, broken out his windows?  That's what you did."  So he apologized profusely, the police came and I turned to Sayeed, and I said, "Sayeed, he cannot have a record.  This is a straight A kid.  He's not a bad kid.  They just watch too much movie, too angry, this is a great kid."  To make a long story short, he did not press charges and I told Parker he had to do fifty hours of community service with Sayeed.  They shook hands and I told Parker in order for him to stay in the program and to get his college scholarship from me, Sayeed had to come to me and tell me that this was--he was a great kid.  And the policemen were very kind and they turned to him and said you know 'cause they came up here and they saw the place and they were like and you don't wanna get kicked out of that program.  Come on.  So he--kid apologized to everybody.  We were all hugging and crying, but we were a team so Sayeed, Ms. Echols, the policemen, we were all a team saying the same thing.  This was not a black kid.  This was not a Hispanic kid.  This was a white kid.  Culturally no.  It's about kids, dealing with kids.
Story_ID: 296779
Speaker 1: When you look back on everything you've done so far in life--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --is there any major thing that you would do differently?
Speaker 2: Probably not scare as many parents as I've scared (laughter).  Probably not scare, intimidate as many men and women as I have.  But it's my way of screening them.  Finding out who's really serious.  Yeah probably wouldn't beat 'em up as badly 'cause I beat up some men and women.  I beat up some parents, I really have.  Hold them accountable.  Hold them accountable.
Speaker 1: Well now teachers say in Chicago Public Schools [CPS] and I guess other school systems too that that's the key they say.  A lot of them say the parents; you know they blame the parents for the behavior of the kids.
Speaker 2: That's right.  It--teaching starts at home.  There are two things and they're not minced.  One is there is an old school where the parents really believed it was the teachers' job to teach their child.  So they would say well you supposed to--no, no, no, no.  It's a team.  You're supposed to too.  You need to work with that kid at home.  Make--check to see if that child has homework.  Make certain that it's done.  Don't ask the child if they have homework, say show it to me (laughter). Let me see it.  And then I call you when you tell me well he told me he had it.  You're not raising your child.  You're getting, getting your child out of your way.  You're not raising that child and I won't do that part for you.  So I probably will try to find a more slightly gentler way to beat them up.  But still beat them up but just be a little more gentle about it because there were a couple of them that I did let go.  If I could do it over, I would not let them go.  I would not let them go.  I would do everything in my power to encourage the parent to change her mind, his or her mind in terms of the way they're doing things.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 296780
Speaker 1: Now, likewise when you look back over your life to this point--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --what would you consider today to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: An honest and sincere attempt to save a child one graduate at a time as honestly as I can from my heart.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, one at a time though.  One at a time.  So they'll know who I am, they'll know that I am serious and that I am real and we'll mutually give to one another, yeah.
Speaker 1: I had to ask you're out here in California--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --cause your--do you have what you consider family here or?
Speaker 2: Just me.  I know I've got cousins here but I gotta have a cousin but as far as I'm concerned, it's just me.  We don't have a relationship.  I don't have relationships, as I shared how I was raised, so my family is my EYM [Educating Young Minds, Los Angeles, California] family that I have cultivated the past seventeen years.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 296781
Speaker 1: Is there anything that I have not asked you that you think we should discuss before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: Okay, well there are a couple of people whose names I don't think I mentioned that are so important to me and my sisters, my sisters are Winnie [Echols Berry], who's named after my aunt, one of my aunts, Winnie, and her two children and her husband.  Her last name is now Berry, B-E-R-R-Y, and so I would want to definitely call her name.  She's my sister and a friend and my other sister, her name is Wanda [Echols].  We used to call her Mookie [ph.] because when she was young, she couldn't say milk.  And she's the one who unfortunately got into the drugs when she was in college and my mother [Will Eva Harmon Echols] adopted the boys, her children, and we've been raising them and getting them through schools.  The oldest one is a senior now in college in Martin, Tennessee, so we're excited about that and the other two and their names are Kevin--Kevin [ph.], Philip [ph.] and Anthony [ph.].  And I also have a brother [half-brother] as I mentioned, Earl Harmon [ph.] who is also in Jackson [Mississippi] with his lovely daughter and wife.  There have been some people who've been very, very, very loving and kind in terms of my family and of course my Aunt Evelyn and Evelyn Davis [ph.] in Memphis, Tennessee and one of my favorite cousins in the entire world Debra, Debra [ph.].  So outside of that I just, I've been blessed.  I've been blessed with so much love, so much giving.  There is a woman here who supports and is such a great friend.  Her name is Sue Bonzell, of the Sue Bonzell Foundation [ph.] and she supports not only the program [Educating Young Minds, Los Angeles, California], but me.  She'll hear something in my voice and take me to the theater.  I've got friends who've just been--and she's one.  We're talking about executives and foundation heads (laughter).
Story_ID: 296782
Speaker 1: So I'm blessed and people now will approach me and say it's not about how much I need but what they can do 'cause they would want to do the best that they can do, you know.  And unfortunately we, just don't have enough of them to do what we need to do.  We need--this facility [for Educating Young Minds, Los Angeles, California] is ready.  We now need to open up other facilities.  We need to go to South Central [South Los Angeles, California], we need to go to those babies who are in gangs who don't want to be and I know I'm telling you I talked to them.  I know grandmamas and mamas that know that their babies are gangbanging.  They know that their baby just shot on the freeway.  They know it.  They know it.  And their hands are tied.  What do they do?  I had my own attitude about that, 'cause I think if you lock a couple of grandmamas and mamas up (laughter) you know but we can't do that you know.  But we've got to find a way to reach and help the people who are really wanting the help but they don't know how to extend themselves.  Most of them aren't educated.  They don't know how to access that help.  And you got a lot of babies who are being forced into situations they don't want to be in and I am telling you I, I know it.  I talked to them.  I know the stories.  Their friends will call me.  I've got kids here who will ask me to take their friend.  They say, "Ms. Echols [HistoryMaker Angeles Echols], can you help my friend out?"  That's how at the gala last year, we not only gave the scholarship money to our kids, but we let our kids, all of the graduates who got their six to ten thousand dollars we let them select one friend to help.  So we ended up giving more money to four more kids, their friends.  One is a young girl, she and her mom are homeless.  They live in a shelter.  Another is a beautiful Asian young lady who lives in a little apartment in the hood with her mom and sister in this one room and we went to all of their homes and interviewed them.  She's at Yale [University, New Haven, Connecticut] now.  Sent me the most beautifulest [ph.] letter.  We just have to go and get these babies and that's what we're doing, we're trying to to go and get them.  Now we need to open up about six more centers.  Jackson [Mississippi] needs it badly.  Memphis, Tennessee needs it badly.  There are places in Georgia that needs it badly.  There are places in Mississippi that kids, I saw it myself kids and teenagers are still using outhouses as bathrooms.  They're going to outhouses to go to the bathroom.  They're still kids, lots of kids going to school in the South with no shoes, no textbooks, no materials.  So we need to find a way to reach them.  I would love to put centers there.  Could you imagine putting centers there?  Could you imagine going into the middle of the hood and putting up these centers?  That's a dream.
Story_ID: 296783
Speaker 1: My last question is similar--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --to legacy but a little different.  Ma'am you're still young, but how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: I'll have to answer it honestly.  I don't care.  I could care less.  I could care less.  I just need EYM [Educating Young Minds, Los Angeles, California] to go on.  EYM has to continue.  That's me.  EYM continues, continues, I am remembered, but EYM. I could care less what people think or how I'm remembered down the line.  What you think of me--?  I don't--legacy ah, not that either. Just continue EYM, move the babies.  Because you know who will carry the legacy and who will remember me? Each child whose heart I touched, they will have their own story.  So they will create the legacy in their own hearts and spirts and they'll pass it down to their kids. In terms of a legacy and being remembered and I could care less.
Speaker 1: Well thank you, thank you so much for sharing with us.
Speaker 2: Thank you for having me.  Thank you.

Speaker 1: In this photo you will find my lovely family.  My mother [Will Eva Harmon Echols] is in the middle with my grandmother [Jessie Harmon (ph.)] and my father.  That picture was taken when I was an undergraduate student at Cornell [University, Ithaca, New York] so I'm pretty certain it was taken in the '80s [1980s] and as a matter of fact three years ago, we lost my grandmother so that's a very important picture and that is the kitchen I was raised in.  Now I may be a little dramatic and sentimental though so bear with me okay.  I won't just say that's mama, that's the dog, that's the cat so.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah that's my sister Winnie [Echols Berry] and her baby, my niece.  And we--this was taken about ten years ago.  We were visiting the church.  We were both--she lives in Jackson, Mississippi and we were in Memphis, Tennessee and Morning View Baptist Church [Memphis, Tennessee], the church that we were raised in.  We attended church services with my mother and I have another sister Wanda [Harmon] who is not in that particular photo.  And my sister's name is Winnie Berry and her daughter's name is Ebon, Ebon Berry [ph.].
Speaker 1: And there, that's coming (unclear) at the church and coming down the steps of the church in Memphis, Tennessee, Morning View Baptist Church.
Speaker 2: That is a picture of my scholarship babies.  Some of my EYM [Educating Young Minds, Los Angeles, California] graduates.  Some of the students who attended Cornell--I'm sorry attended EYM starting in the fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth grade and they graduated college and/or are attending colleges.  That's that particular group.  Hi guys.  And that was taken four years ago, approximately four years ago.  And those students attended and/or graduating from Stanford [Stanford University, Stanford, California] and Berkeley [University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, California] and USC [University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California] and it's, it's, it's incredible, approximately 2002.
Speaker 1: That is at last year's gala, the fundraiser.  We now have the fundraiser once a year where we raise scholarship money for all of the EYM students and last year we honored Mr. Percy Pinkney at [U.S.] Senator Dianne Feinstein's office and in that photo you'll see the board members.  You'll see some of the EYM board members including Mr. Bill Duke [HistoryMaker Bill Duke], producer, writer, director.  Kawanna Myers Brown, she's the CEO [sic. COO] of the Magic Johnson Corporation [Magic Johnson Enterprises, Inc.].  Mr. Henry Chism [ph.].  Next to Mr. Chism, Kawanna Myers Brown.  She is the executive, she is the CEO of the Magic Johnson Corporation [Magic Johnson Enterprises, Inc.], you have myself.  You have writer, producer, director, Mr. Bill Duke, wonderful Ms. Tina Treadwell, writer producer and you have Mr. Adrian Bocka [ph.] next to her and Mr. Bocka [ph.] is a attorney for the program.  He's helping me direct the program in terms of opening twenty-one centers nationwide.  As a matter of fact, he's responsible for the nonprofit status because he encouraged me to get that 501(c)(3) and next to him is Mr. Percy Pinkney at Senator Feinstein's office, the wonderful man we honored at this year's gala.
Speaker 2: That's one of my favorite pictures.  From left to right, from the left is my father and the salt and pepper haired guy is my fiance, who is on an airplane from New York [New York] right now on his way here.  Okay I know you don't need all of that but--oh I'm sorry my father's name to the left is J.D. Echols and the salt and peppered haired gentlemen is Mr. Melvin Williams [ph.].
Speaker 1: And that's my grandmother again.  That's my grandmother on my father's side [Katie Franklin].  Unfortunately I don't know much about my family on my mother's side, but my family side is quite extensive.  And that was taken approximately ten years ago, ten or eleven years ago, so minus 2006, so we're taking '96 [1996], approximately '96 [1996].
Speaker 2: That was a joyous occasion.  That was last year, June of last year, EYM moved into a brand new facility, a beautiful location on Wilshire Boulevard [Los Angeles, California] and that's the ribbon cutting ceremony with our directors and with our supporters and foundation leaders and just a number of people from supporters from California Community Foundation [Los Angeles, California], Weingart [Foundation, Los Angeles, California], Mr. Samuel Goldwyn [Jr.] is there in the middle.  Just a number of wonderful people.  And that was 2005 June, yes.  Our new million dollar location.

Speaker 1: That is a picture when I first started teaching nineteen years ago, nineteen, twenty years ago at Trinity Lutheran School [Los Angeles, California] and that wonderful parent is one of my first, was my first parent in the tutorial program.  Her daughter is Yvette Osay [ph.] who now attends USC [University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California].
Speaker 2: The same day, the same setting in my classroom at Trinity Lutheran School because I started the tutorial program while I was teaching there and I started tutoring kids in my one room apartment.
Speaker 1: Yes, I was selected in 2005, I was selected as one of the twenty-five most outstanding alumni at Cornell [University, Ithaca, New York] in education and the Cornell alumni magazine did a beautiful piece on myself, the program and my children.  That piece was done I believe in October of 2001, no 2004 I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: That's an article, that one of the articles that the L.A. Times [Los Angeles Times] did for their Sunday metro section, their education [section].  They did a wonderful piece on myself and the school, the program and my kids titled "The Tough-Love Approach to Tutoring" and that was done 2000 of October.
Speaker 1: This is so exciting.  Well that's when my rubber band broke.  That's a picture when I was six and a half.  I was six and a half going on seven.  I was a baby in Memphis, Tennessee and the elementary school was Georgia Avenue Elementary School [Memphis, Tennessee].
Speaker 2: Oh that was in the '70s [1970s] when--that is a picture when I was modeling prior to teaching.  That's a picture of when I started modeling in my mid-twenties when I was a baby.
Speaker 1: Again a modeling photo--a photo when I thought I wanted to be a model, taken in the early '80s [1980s].  Another model shot taken in the '80s [1980s], early '80s [1980s].
Speaker 2: Oh I just forgot a very important picture.  Oh no.  I didn't bring it.
Speaker 1: A performance during the '70s [1970s] during the period of various New York [New York] shows that was one of the musicals I did in New York.  I did a series of musicals from 'The Wiz,' 'Ain't Misbehaving,' ['Ain't Misbehavin'] I can't remember which one.
Speaker 2: Oh I wish I had that 'Sojourner[: The Story of Sojourner Truth'].  I hadn't been on stage in twenty years.  Remember I told you I hadn't been in the business and last year I did 'Sojourner Truth' and won the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] award and I didn't bring it.  Huge picture.  And I did not bring it.
Speaker 1: That's the third annual scholarship gala 2001, 2002, approximately 2002 with myself in the middle and surrounded by some of my college students who were once EYM [Educating Young Minds, Los Angeles, California] tutorial students and some of the various schools that they attended.
Speaker 2: Those are three of my babies in various colleges.  As a matter of fact one to your left she was a part of the situation in New Orleans [Louisiana] at Dillard [University] and but anyway those are my college babies, some of my college babies.  And they are graduates of 2004, 2005 and one is a senior this year.
Speaker 1: That's just one of the shots of one of our, one of our gatherings where I believe it's the Christmas party celebration.  See the Christmas hat there.  It's part of the Christmas party celebration.  Well both of those were Christmas party celebrations and we exchange gifts and celebrate our blessings.  And the kids are from four and a half to twenty-one, all a part of EYM, EYM students.
