Story_ID: 637093
Speaker 1: Okay, so I want to start out--I'm gonna ask, I'm gonna talk about your family history and I want to talk about your father first, and I know you were raised by your mother [Mosetta Smalls].
Speaker 2: Yes ma'am.
Speaker 1: But can I have his name?
Speaker 2: My fa- my father's name was William Henry Brewington [William Brewington].
Speaker 1: So you have his, your middle name is--
Speaker 2: And my brother has his other name, Henry.  Ronnie is Ronald Henry Brewington [HistoryMaker Ronald H. Brewington], yes.
Speaker 1: And what do you, what can you tell, do you know his date of birth or, you know, his year of birth and what do you know about his growing up?
Speaker 2: I didn't know much about my father in as much as my mother and my father divorced when I was three years old, and my mother raised me.  I didn't know my father my entire life.  When I became approximately eighteen years old and in the United States Marine Corps, I sought him out and I found him in Brooklyn, New York, and I knocked on the door and a woman answered and I said, "Hi, is this the residence of William Henry Brewington?"  And she said, "Yes."  And I said, "Would you tell him that his son, [HistoryMaker] Rudolph Brewington, is outside?"  And the door opened and it was my father.  And I got to know him for like about two years or so.  He was a chef at the Waldorf Astoria [Waldorf Astoria New York, New York, New York].  He had a side business, limousine business where he'd run people like Aretha Franklin, James Brown, et cetera around.  He'd chauffeur them around.  And unfortunately he passed at the age of fifty, very young, of a heart attack.  He was a wonderful person, a fun person.  He was the one of thirteen children raised by Henrietta [Henrietta Douglas Brewington] and James Brewington in Sanford, North Carolina.  And I've got to know my family over the years, that side of my family.  My mother's side of the family are the Smalls, including--well, we'll get to that in a moment.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 637094
Speaker 1: So let's talk--so let me have your mother's name.
Speaker 2: My mother's name was Mosetta Smalls, the joy of my life.  She was raised in Charleston, South Carolina, at the age of about eighteen--about twelve, she and her mother and her father, Moses [Moses Smalls], moved, Carrie [Carrie Smalls] was her mother's name, moved to New York [New York] from Charleston, South Carolina.  And about two years after they got there, two or three years after they got there, she died.  And my mother pretty much raised herself.  She was the niece of Ed Smalls, of Small's Paradise [New York, New York] fame.  Everyone knows who Small's Paradise was, I mean it's one of the most historic black cabarets, clubs, in the world.  She was his grandniece [sic.].  And he was famous in his right in as much as he was the great-great nephew of Robert Smalls.  Now, Robert Smalls you ask, who is he?  Robert Smalls was the first African American captain in the United States.  Approximately circa 1864 a band of slaves led by Robert Smalls captured the Confederate gun ship, the CSC Planter [sic. CSS Planter], weighed anchor and sailed it out to the Union blockade.  For that he was emancipated personally by President Lincoln, [President] Abraham Lincoln, and he became during the war a, a, a blockade runner, a captain, and after the war [Civil War] he became one of the first seventeen black congressmen in the United States Congress during that period known as Reconstruction.  So I come back, I come from a family of achievers and accomplishers.  And so I can--whatever has happened to me in my life I can only ascribe to my mother and the genes from my family that went up behind her.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  'Cause, you know, I, I don't know if you know Andrew Billingsley but (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes ma'am.
Speaker 1: --done--
Speaker 2: Yes ma'am.
Speaker 1: --a, a book on Robert Smalls ['Yearning to Breathe Free: Robert Smalls of South Carolina and His Families'].
Speaker 2: Yes ma'am.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 637095
Speaker 1: So, tell me about what else your--about your mother's growing up and what--did she talk about that at all?
Speaker 2: She didn't talk much about it.  She, she, she talked about being at--after her mother [Carrie Smalls] died she pretty much raised herself.  I believe she lived near Small's Paradise.  She did mention once about being--Billie Holiday being one of her roommates but she didn't talk very much about her life.  But she was a woman who had a limited education, but she wanted more for her children.  She was the one that if I bent that way she bent that way, I bent that way she met me, got me straight.  She gave me my standards, my view of the world.  I'm sorry.
Speaker 1: It's okay.
Speaker 2: She was the joy of my life.  Anything I am or ever hope to be I am because of Mosetta Smalls.  She reared us.  She taught us, instilled values in us, understanding of the world.  She said, we may be poor, and we were, living in Harlem [New York, New York] in the projects [St. Nicholas Houses], but you don't have to be stupid and ignorant, and she raised us that way.  And so, as I moved in the world in these sixty-seven years I carry her with me everywhere I go she's stand- she's standing beside me.  Excuse me, I'm sorry.  I didn't mean--
Speaker 1: It's okay.  It's not a problem.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Okay.
Speaker 1: You want a tissue?
Speaker 2: I'm all right.  I'm okay.  I'm okay.  So that's who she was and in her last years, I spent, I brought her down from Washington, D- from New York [New York] to Washington, D.C.  I ensconced her an apartment.  I gave her everything that she wanted.  Before she passed she said, "You were a good son."  Of all the titles in the world, that meant the most to me.  "You were a good son."  That's all I could say.  I'm sorry.  I'm gonna cry.
Speaker 1: That's okay.  So do you want a tissue?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No.  When I talk about her I get emotional.
Speaker 1: So, I understand.
Speaker 2: She meant so much to me.
Speaker 1: That's great, I mean for a son to have love for his mother like that.
Speaker 2: I had to.
Speaker 1: Now was she named after her father?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: 'Cause--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --Moses, she was Mosetta.
Speaker 2: Yes.  His name was Moses [Moses Smalls] and she was Mosetta, yes.  Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And so when you said she raised herself, was she living with her father after, 'cause I, that's what I didn't understand.
Speaker 2: I didn't understand that either.  I mean, that I--'cause a lot of--for years she didn't tell me about stuff and I did ask her one time before she passed to sit down and tell me about her life.  But apparently she didn't live with her father, she lived on her own as a child in New York City.  And she worked; she did piece work, you know, where you get paid a certain amount of pennies for certain piece work.  She did, she worked in the city schools.  She started out when they were ladling food, soup and she rose to the rank of a cook manager where she was the manager of a staff of about fifteen people.  And, in a city school, and they would prepare meals for the children.  And she was well loved, well regarded, well respected, missed by a lot of people.
Story_ID: 637096
Speaker 1: You know 'cause that was--so she, so what's your earliest memory growing up?
Speaker 2: Mama [Mosetta Smalls], her.  My father [William Brewington] wasn't there.  It was just mama, and mama was there and we used to sit down and she was poor.  We lived in the projects.  We lived in the St. Nicholas projects [St. Nicholas Houses, New York, New York].  And she would sit us down and she'd say, "Boys this is what I got. I owe this, this and this.  This is for us."  She taught me that you have to learn how to live within your means and you live with what you have.  You know, you try to, you aspire to more but you live with what you have and--
Speaker 1: So did she--so your brother [HistoryMaker Ronald H. Brewington], 'cause you're the, you know, you're an identical twin.
Speaker 2: Ma'am.
Speaker 1: Right.  So your earliest memory is your mother.  I'm talking about your earliest memory.
Speaker 2: My earliest memory is my mother.
Speaker 1: Is your mother with--
Speaker 2: Raising us.
Speaker 1: --but can you give me a specific memory?
Speaker 2: All I see, I remember her, you know, being there for us, talking to us every day, teaching us, picking us up from school and taking us here and there.  And she, you know, when we, when we got a little older she would give us treats.  For example, when we graduated from high school [Cardinal Hayes High School, New York, New York] she took us to, which was then at the World Trade Center [New York, New York], Windows on the World up in New York on the 102nd floor [sic.].  Of course, the building is now collapsed.  And she'd take us there.  She'd take us to Chinese restaurants.  She'd take us, when she could afford it, to nice places to show us that, you know--'cause one of the things she always taught me was in the world if you achieve an accomplish you get rewarded.  And so this was a reward.  "You all did, you and your boys, you, you and your brother did this, here."  Well we were fifty years old, when we reached fifty years old she gave both of us five thousand dollars apiece which was tremendous amount of money for her.  That's ten thousand dollars.  And she said, "The reason I give you this, you two guys this, is because you never had, I never had to go to school for the police on you or the principal.  You boys followed what I did.  You were good boys."  You, you know--and so this was her--a treat to us.
Story_ID: 637097
Speaker 1: So what was your--you lived in St. Nicholas [St. Nicholas Houses]--
Speaker 2: Projects.
Speaker 1: --project, okay.
Speaker 2: Yes ma'am.
Speaker 1: And they're located where?
Speaker 2: They're in Harlem [New York, New York] on a hundred- stretching from 127th Street and 8th Avenue [Frederick Douglass Boulevard] to 7th Avenue [Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevard] all the way to 131st Street.  It's one of the projects that, you know, low income families live in.
Speaker 1: So can you describe your apartment?
Speaker 2: Very small compared to where I live now.  I mean it was a, there was a, there was a kitchen.  You'd come in and there was a kitchen and a little dining area and a small living room and then as you went back there was a bedroom for me and my brother, and there was a bedroom for her [Brewington's mother, Mosetta Smalls].  And this is where we were raised.  We were raised around a lot of drugs, crime.  She kept us away from that.  She taught us, you know, don't, you know, she made us.  You don't fall victim to this.  You have a bigger thing to achieve and accomplish in life and so you move on.  And, it's funny because most of the friends that I was raised with are either dead or in jail or mostly dead, drug addicts, you name it.  And she kept us away from that.  I mean, you know, not, she, not by keeping us but she made--for example, she would make us come upstairs early.  We used to be mad.  "Mama, I want to stay down here and play."  "No, you come upstairs and get in these books."  And she did that.
Speaker 1: So you, you lived there, you lived there until what age?
Speaker 2: Until I graduated from high school at age seventeen, and I graduated from Cardinal Hayes High School in the Bronx [New York], a school that's famous for people like Mashburn, Jamal Mashburn the, the basket- former basketball player who is now the owner of multiple franchises.  Regis Philbin went there in high school.  It was a Catholic high school.  She almost died.  Let me put, let me put this in context.  Moms almost died one--of an intestine situation and she was given the last rites of the Catholic church.  And so we were Baptist at the time and so we had to convert to Catholicism.
Speaker 1: So that--she almost died before you were born?
Speaker 2: Yes, no while, no, no while we were about ten, twelve years old.
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: And both of us, Ron [HistoryMaker Ronald H. Brewington] and I, were sent to foster homes in Geneva, New York.  I'll never forget that.
Story_ID: 637098
Speaker 1: So I want to go back to your, you know, young years and if you could tell me what sights, smells and sounds remind you of growing up.
Speaker 2: Oh boy.  Surprise Rotisserie [New York, New York] on 136th Street and 7th Avenue [Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevard].  They had the best spare ribs, spaghetti in the world.  I tried to replicate that either by my own cooking or trying to find it in the world--can't.  There was another place called Murphy's [ph.] over on 141st Street and 8th Avenue [Frederick Douglass Boulevard].  They had the best fish and chips, (unclear) chips.  I remember the sites of, of, of--we use to play in St. Nicholas Park [New York, New York] up the street.  We--mama [Mosetta Smalls] would pack lunches for us and we'd go up and sit up in the trees and, and, and, and have adventures up there.  Just, just the whole p- Harlem [New York, New York] was a poor place back then, you know, but it had vibrancy to it that you didn't think, we didn't know we were poor.  You know, we just figured we were like--'cause everybody else around us was poor, where we, you know, we didn't know.  We weren't millionaires, we knew that, you know, but we, we, we, we had a good fulfilling life.
Speaker 1: What about--I don't hear sounds so much.  I heard sights (cough) but--
Speaker 2: Oh, there were sounds.  We'd hear people getting shot.  Shootings went on regularly around us.  I mean it was Harlem, you know, back in the day.  I mean, you know, drug addicts would shoot each other.  Bumpy Johnson was in that era.  They were, you know, his people, I believe were part of the shootings and what not.  But yeah we, we heard the sounds but it was a good sound.  I mean, not the shootings but the other sounds were, were laughter, people making the most out of their life, such as what it is.  It, it was, it was good life growing up, good life.
Story_ID: 637099
Speaker 1: Was church a part of your life? I know you went to Catholic school (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, ma'am
Speaker 1: --but was church a part of your life?
Speaker 2: Yes, it was.  Mom [Mosetta Smalls] used to take us to Baptist church around the corner and she'd go with us and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What was the name of the church?
Speaker 2: I for- oh, it was one of these storefront churches; I can't even begin to tell you the name of it, on 8th Avenue [Frederick Douglass Boulevard] at 138th Street.  It was just a very, you know, your, your gospel music, I was raised with gospel music.  I was raised with, with, with God and the concept of God and, you know, this is why when I pray today, excuse me, I tell, I tell when I pray, I say, "And Lord please keep her close to you 'cause she's the one that told me about your son, Jesus."  We were raised in a very religious way, I mean there was, you know, there was no doubt; there was no question about it.  You went to church.  You know, you had learned certain values in church.  And then we've got--once we got in the Catholic church we were altar boys, Ron [Brewington's brother, HistoryMaker Ronald H. Brewington] and I, we were altar boys.  I, I served many a mass, acolyte, thurifer, boat, you know the different positions in there.  I even had aspirations of being a priest at one time, but then when I found out that celibacy was involved I went uh oh, no (laughter) not going that way.
Story_ID: 637100
Speaker 1: So did you, what, what, what is your elementary school that you're going to?
Speaker 2: I went to P.S. 5 public school [New York, New York] and then after mom [Mosetta Smalls] turned I went to St. Charles Borromeo Catholic elementary school [St. Charles Borromeo School, New York, New York].  I went to St. Thomas the Apostle Catholic elementary school [St. Thomas the Apostle School, New York, New York].
Speaker 1: Can I have dates? Okay, or?
Speaker 2: Well, I grad- let's, let's, let me see, let's go backwards.  I graduated from high school in 1964, from 1960 to 1964.  So from let's say circa, in the 1950s I went to St. Thomas to, from let's say the late, the mid-'50s [1950s], mid, mid-'50s [1950s] to 1960 I went to St. Thomas the Apostle.  I went to St. Charles Borromeo, St. Joseph's [St. Joseph's Elementary School, New York, New York].  So this was, let's say, everything leading up to 1960 when in 1960 I went to high school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I graduated from high school at Cardinal Hayes High School [New York, New York] in July, June of 1964.
Speaker 1: So those are three Catholic schools--
Speaker 2: Yes ma'am.
Speaker 1: --that you went to.
Speaker 2: Yes ma'am.
Speaker 1: So why was the switch between the first two, 'cause, christ- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well they went, they only--
Speaker 1: --you were in what grade when you first went 'cause you said you were about ten I think--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --when, when she, you know--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --decided--
Speaker 2: But I had converted.
Speaker 1: --to change.
Speaker 2: Right.  Well we switched because, you know, we went--Catholic schools at that time had a hard time and they were having money problems and so the closest one to us was St. Charles Borromeo and we went there and then we went to St. Joseph's and then we went to St. Thomas.  When we moved into the projects [St. Nicholas Houses, New York, New York] on a hundred- 'cause we were living on 138th Street, not in the projects, and then we moved to the projects.  That's one of the reasons why we moved because that was the Catholic school closest to us.
Speaker 1: Do you remember detecting that something was wrong with your mother, I mean, around that time were you questioning her change to Catholicism at all?
Speaker 2: No, no, no (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: It was, it was simply this is what she wanted.  I mean once, once she got sick and, had, she had to convert so her children had to convert.
Story_ID: 637101
Speaker 1: Okay, so you said during that time you had to go to a foster.
Speaker 2: Yes, well mama [Mosetta Smalls] was sick about, we were about ten years old, nine, ten years old.  Mama had an intestines problems and she almost died.  And so they sent me and my brother up to the city, sent me and my brother upstate, Geneva, New York.  I stayed with a white doctor and his family, Dr. Marsh- Dr. Marshall [ph.], and it was an interesting experience.
Speaker 1: Both of you stayed or you were split (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, Ron [HistoryMaker Ronald H. Brewington] stayed in another, with another white family, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And so how, what was interesting about that experience?
Speaker 2: It was one of my first brushes with racism.  The children of the doctor didn't like me as a black person and they made fun of me and the color of my skin.  And I had never had it 'cause I lived in Harlem [New York, New York].  I mean Harlem was mostly black, I mean, I only dealt with black people.  And so that was my first time, the first of a number of times in my life that I had, had to came in close, came in contact with racism and it, and it hurt.  I remember it being a very hurtful experience.
Speaker 1: So they were the--you're saying that the--why were, why did the, the state or the city place you, you know, with, with a white family like that?
Speaker 2: I don't know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I just had to go along with, you know, one day I was told, "You're gonna go here," and somebody took me and put me on a train and sent me up in Geneva and that was that.
Speaker 1: And how long were you there you said (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I was there for about eight months--
Speaker 1: That's a long time.
Speaker 2: --six to eight months.  Yes.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: You know, and it was, I, I saw my brother regularly.  He was with another family, but the family I was with, you know, the, the mother and father were cool, but the kids, you know.  I don't know if they were just being kids or they were being racist or whatever, but I, I got the, I, I was, I got what today is called racism or bullying or whatever you want to call it.
Speaker 1: So were you fitting in with the family?  I'm just trying to understand.
Speaker 2: I, the fa- I fitted with the father and mother but the kids, you know, kids are kids.  Kids can be very treacherous.  Kids can be very scornful.  They can be very hurtful.  They just treated me in a less than a nice way and I, I and I didn't do anything to them, you know, and I use to cry some nights and, and, and go to bed and cry 'cause I was like shocked.  I mean this is not something that I had come in contact with ever in my life.  I mean I lived in Harlem.  There were whites in Harlem, there were Jews and whites who came and collect rent and stuff like that.  But I had never seen racism up to that point.  I was, you know, because Harlem was Harlem.
Speaker 1: And, you know, I bet your mother was terribly frightened, you know, because the--you're her little babies and she could, you know, she's sick and, you know, so the risk of losing you.
Speaker 2: Well yeah, but she, she didn't know.  I mean once they shipped us off she was still in the hospital.
Speaker 1: But she has to have known that something--who was taking care of you during that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I, I don't know.
Speaker 1: --time?  Yeah, I'm sure she was.
Speaker 2: Okay, I don't know.  I was a child--
Speaker 1: I mean like.  Yeah--
Speaker 2: --and I was told get on the train and I got on the train and that was that.
Speaker 1: --um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 637102
Speaker 1: So when, so you're saying that you and Ron [Brewington's brother, HistoryMaker Ronald H. Brewington] saw each other during that time.
Speaker 2: Yes we did, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Periodically, yes.
Speaker 1: Now, how would you describe your personality at that time?
Speaker 2: Outgoing as, as I am now, outgoing, fun, happy go lucky, happy.  Just a good, overall happy, you know, life.
Speaker 1: Um-hm. Did you live at all, I mean--so how is your interaction with your twin at this point?  Are you dressed alike?  Do you, you know, like talking to each other?  Are you best friends?  I mean, at that point of growing up?
Speaker 2: At that point and it extended until today, he is my best friend.  Yes we, as children were dre- mom [Mosetta Smalls] used to dress us alike.  As we grew up and developed our own personalities we deviate from each other in certain respects but in a com- there's, there is still a commonality between the two of us in our dressing, in our likes and dislikes.  He's my best friend.  I mean, I speak to him every day.  I mean I, we email each other multiple times every day.  You know, we, we, since we both had--and our lives have paralleled each other.  I mean in as much as I went in the [U.S.] military, he went in the military.  I got into journalism.  He got into journalism.  I mean, you know, so we're like very much like that to this day.  I mean I spent this past weekend with him and, you know, when I see him it's always a pleasure to see him.  We hug.  I still kiss him on the mouth--he don't like that (laughter) you know, but we're very close and, and, and I love him.  I love him very dearly and I, the only thing I worry about is which one of us is gonna pass first 'cause it's gonna be--and we're getting up in age now so, I mean you know, it's gone be difficult for me to live, if he goes first, without him because I've had him in my life since I woke up in my crib one day and said, "Who are you?  What are you doing in my space?" (Laughter).
Story_ID: 637103
Speaker 1: So, so what, what was your interest?  So describe just a couple more things of life in the, in the Brewington household like let's, let's go past, you know, ten.  I mean holidays other--were there family members around?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes, there were family members around.  My mother's [Mosetta Smalls] brother, Uncle Bubba [ph.] and he had a family that lived in another projects, the Abraham Lincoln projects [Abraham Lincoln Houses, New York, New York], and Coletus [ph.] was his daughter, Barry [ph.], he passed, was his, her son and other family members.  We would, we would interact with them on a regular basis, I mean you know, so they'd come to our house, we'd go to their house.  Holidays was special, you know I mean within the confines of being poor they tried to make the best of it, and I will never thank her enough for that.  She tried to make the best of it.  I mean you know, like I said, I didn't realize I was poor because (laughter) we had clothes, we had food, we had toys.  I mean it wasn't extravagant, I mean but we had it. I kept us happy and we interacted with the neighbors well and all that.  I mean it was just, just a wonderful--my life, my young life was a wonderful life growing up.
Speaker 1: Now were there chores that you had?
Speaker 2: Of course.
Speaker 1: Okay, so what were (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That goes without saying.
Speaker 1: --the chores?
Speaker 2: Oh we had to wash dishes.  You know mama worked so we had to wash dishes.  We had to brush, you know, sweep the house and keep the house clean and, and all that.  Yeah, of course and then that, that was all part of her project duties of teaching us responsibility.  And yes you--of course we did.  There was no doubt about it.  She taught us how to cook.  She taught us, she said, she taught us how to cook, wash, sew and iron.  She said one day, she said and she'd always proceed this with, "Boy your wife is gonna be sick and the maid won't be able to come in, so you gonna have to learn how to do (laughter) it yourself."  And she taught us how to do it.  And to this day, I mean, I can cook, my brother [HistoryMaker Ronald H. Brewington] can cook and, you know, we're grateful for that.  I mean I, like I said in every respect.  You know she taught me one thing.  She said, you know, "Boy, any woman can be a mother but every mother ain't a mother."  I was blessed.  I had a real mother in every respect of the word which is why I, we loved her so much and we respected her so much and we regarded her so much.  And if you talk to my brother--he, I know he will tell you the same exact thing (simultaneous).
Story_ID: 637104
Speaker 1: So what other things are sort of informing you as you're a young, you know, adolescent, you know, you're ad- young adolescent boys?  'Cause the thing that, you know, that's when you're becoming really aware of the world outside (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and, you know, you said, you know--we're in the late '50s [1950s].  Now how much of your, how much of the, the, the community, the surrounding community, how much of it is Caribbean or is there, or is it, I mean what is the, what is the sort of the, the mix?
Speaker 2: The mix?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Well, back in those days in Harlem [New York, New York] it was primarily black (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) (Unclear).
Speaker 2: On the outskirts of Harlem, on the fringes of Harlem there were Dominicans.  Puerto Ricans were everywhere, I mean you know, and, and there was another projects called the, the, the Grant projects, Grant Houses [General Ulysses S. Grant Houses, New York, New York].  Yes, so we had a, that was the one, that was the good thing about growing up in New York.  I grew up with a mix of people.  So I never judge people.  Color was something that never meant anything to me.  I didn't care if you were white.  I didn't care if you were black.  I, I judged you and saw you as a human being person.  Mama [Mosetta Smalls] taught us that.  "All people are people," she said.  Okay?  And so it wasn't until I got out of, you know, I got, I saw the little racism up in Geneva [New York] and that shocked me but I, it was minor and it was brief and I got back to Harlem and, you know, I looked at there like, "Hm," but you know I got back to Harlem.  And we had the Apollo Theater [New York, New York].  We saw, Ron [Brewington's brother, HistoryMaker Ronald H. Brewington] and I saw all of them, The Jacksons [The Jackson 5], Marvin Gaye, The Supremes.  We saw 'em all come up.  That was the--on Saturday afternoon she'd give us a quarter and we'd go to the Renaissance Theatre [New York, New York] and watch the movies.  You know, back then I used to go to the, to the, to the cavalry, "Get 'em, get 'em."  Yeah I learned (laughter).  Okay I learned who was right and who was wrong (laughter).  That, but I didn't know.
Story_ID: 637105
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh but I, you know, we wasn't into sex.  We was into hugging and, you know, petting and, you know, kissing and that, we didn't have sex as you know sex, you know, today.  I mean, now these kids today, I mean you know, that's why we got what we have.  You know, I mean they got children all over the place.  Well we, we didn't have that, you know.
Speaker 2: Well you know what, so this is a time, so Malcom X--
Speaker 1: Yes, we saw him--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --on a Saturday afternoon.  That's another good thing about growing up in Harlem [New York, New York].  On a Saturday afternoon we can go up to 125th Street, the heart of Harlem and on one corner Malcom X would be there preaching.  On another corner Malcom--Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] would be there preaching, Stokely Carmichael [Kwame Ture] would be there preaching, H. Rap Brown [Jamil Abdullah Al-Amin] would be there preaching.  I mean, you know, so we were immersed in all of this and there was these bookstores.  So all this history was around us.  The Theresa hotel [Hotel Theresa, New York, New York], I mean Martin Luther King was stabbed in Blumstein's [New York, New York] four blocks down the street.  A woman stabbed him in, near his heart with a, with a, with a, with a pencil.  It was an opener.  I mean we saw all this and the Civil Rights Movement as we were coming up was in full swing. So I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So what are you hearing discussed in your neighborhoods and your--and the household?  And what are you becoming aware of?
Speaker 1: I'm becoming aware of my blackness.  I was becoming aware of the fact that things were not equal for black people.  Things were not good for black people.  We wanted, we wanted to be part of the Civil Rights Movement and march.  You know, listening to a Malcom X, listening to a Martin Luther King, seeing these people.  John F. Kennedy [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy], I mean you know, these were people that opened our eyes about civil rights and lack of equality of Af- of people of color in this country.  And, and we wanted to change that.  You know, and so we, we, we realized, we said to ourselves, the key to change is education.  You got to get educated.  You know, there is an old, there is an old story I tell, you know.  Black guy goes into a radio station and, and, and comes outside and tells his friend, "They, they, they wouldn't hi- hi- hi- hire me 'cause I'm b- b- b- black."  No, they didn't hire you 'cause you couldn't talk, (laughter) you know.  But you had to get edu- and we were determined to change the world and make things right and equal.  I wasn't trying to take nothing away from whites or any people, you know, but we want the same thing for us, you know; and then later on, later on that all changed.  We'll talk about that some other time.
Story_ID: 637106
Speaker 1: So when you, when you're graduating and--who, who, who is the more aggressor of, of the two of you, of brothers 'cause I know they're identical but still there's always a little difference.
Speaker 2: Oh there's a little difference, yeah, in certain ways Ron [HistoryMaker Ronald H. Brewington] is aggressive in certain areas and I'm aggressive in certain areas but we have a commonality (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --between us when it comes to education, when it comes to the world, when it comes to trying to--that's why we both got in the media.  Both of us got in the media because we wanted to change the world, to make the world a better place, to make, to, to expose the lies and expose the wrongs in the world so that maybe that would make a difference in, in, in, in, in, in equality in the world.  And that, you know, when you are an African American, I mean, it--race is something that you think of all the time.  I mean you have, in, in, in the world, the world makes you think of it.  I see--my mother [Mosetta Smalls] raised us to think of ourselves as boys and later men, not black men, but men, you know.  You, you, you just as good as anybody else.  I mean we went to Cardinal Hayes High School [New York, New York].  I mean I marched in more St. Patrick's Day parades than you can shake a stick at.  I mean we were all Irish, "Erin go Bragh!"  You know, we would march in, and I graduated in St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York City [New York, New York] with my classmates.  I ran track.  That was another outlet that she would, would, would put us in which would help us to stay away from crime and stay away from drugs.  And I was supposed to get a scholarship to go to St., well either St. John's [St. John's University, Queens, New York] or Manhattan College [Riverdale, New York] and here again racism reared its ugly head.  A Irish guy, friend of mine, I won't mention his name got the scholarship and I could beat him in my best days.  And so, I say well, I guess we have to go in the [U.S.] military.  So I went in the [U.S.] Marine Corps.
Story_ID: 637107
Speaker 1: So how did you choose the [U.S.] Marine Corps?
Speaker 2: Well, to be honest I was walking, I was down in Times Square [New York, New York], 'cause Ron [Brewington's brother, HistoryMaker Ronald H. Brewington] and I used to have, I used to work for a UPS [United Parcel Service] subsidiary called, when I was a teenager, called Red Arrow Messenger Service.  It's beautiful.  I mean we used to wear riding spats and, and with, I'm sorry, the puffed out pants, are we okay?  The puffed out pants and we'd ride bicycles and this was the thing that made it--it was, was good.  This is all part of my upbringing.  Because I didn't have a father, we'll get to that in a minute, but I had a chance to leave Harlem [New York, New York] and go into areas like Park Avenue, Madison Avenue, Sutton Place [New York, New York].  I saw wealthy white people that--and I was like, "Wow look at all this," you know, and, and some of them accepted me and some didn't.  I met Irving Berlin.  I met this one.  I met that one, you know, and, and they were nice to me.  Sarah Vaughan, I met, I met all these people on Park Avenue and Madison Avenue and that was a world of, that, that opened up to me.  I, I, it broaden my horizons in terms of, there's Harlem but there's a bigger world like that; like mama [Mosetta Smalls] had told us.  And so, but she said the key to getting into that bigger world, you know, was education.  Ron, for example, worked for a woman who is--no let begin with me.  I worked for a woman named Dea Carroll.  She used to put on fashion shows in--which is why to this day when I hear people say, "I'm a model," I say "Well, do you, where do you model at?"  Unless you're modelling in New York [New York] or Paris [France] you're playing at it.  She put on fashion shows in The Pierre [New York, New York], in the Plaza [Plaza Hotel, New York, New York], in, in the St. Moritz [Hotel St. Moritz, New York, New York].  I mean I saw the best of the best, clothes wise, because girls admired me 'cause I was a teenager.  They didn't look upon me as a man.  So they didn't have a problem dressing in front of me and putting their, putting their clothes on.  But it was an eye-opening experience for me.  It was all part of my education and it broadened my horizons about the world and the reality of the world.
Speaker 1: So, but things are sort of brewing at the time that you're going (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: --into--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --into the Marines and they're brewing enough that they sort of crescendo a few years later with the, you know, the anti-war movement.
Speaker 2: Yes ma'am.
Speaker 1: So, but there are those who actually did, you know, and, and, you know, you--were you drafted?
Speaker 2: No.  I, I volunteered.
Speaker 1: You volunteered.
Speaker 2: In fact, and now you talk about the reality of the world, a month before I went into the Marine Corps, in fact, in June, this is a part of the history, June of 1964 a young man [James Powell] was shot by a cop [Thomas Gilligan] in New York City six times.  Little young man pulled out a knife like that, that big and he was shot and killed and the cop reloaded his guns after shooting him six times and shot him more times.  Folks went off.  This was the first urban riot in American history.  You may recall it, in 1964, June of 1964, there was a major riot in Harlem.  Harlem was closed off from the rest of New York City.  Food wasn't brought in.  Trains, subways didn't stop and that, I was also kind of like, "hm," to me.  But no, but I joined the Marine Corps because I wanted to go to college.  And so I went down to Times Square one day and I saw this guy and he had this fabulous uniform on, dressed blue tops and he was looking sharp, he was looking kind of sharp.  And I said, "I want to be that."  And so I joined the Marine Corps.  I didn't have any idea that, what all was entailed in joining the Marines, the Marines being the nine one one, the first force to go in.  I was fortunate.  The first year I spent down in Beaufort, South Carolina [Marine Corps Air Station Beaufort], and then I was at Camp Lejuene [Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune, Jacksonville, North Carolina] for a minute.  And then I was selected one of the first African Americans selected to serve on the Marine Honor Guard [U.S. Marine Corps Honor Guard] at Marine Barracks, 8th [Street] and I [Street] Southeast in Washington, D.C. where I, I was one of the first blacks to be at White House ceremonies.  And I was burying people at Arlington National Cemetery [Arlington, Virginia] and other places, Iwo Jima [United State Marine Corps War Memorial, Arlington, Virginia] and that was another great experience, eye opening experience for me as well. And then af-
Speaker 1: Okay--
Speaker 2: And then after that I went to Vietnam.
Story_ID: 637108
Speaker 1: So what are you learning?  So when you go down--how was the training at Beaufort [Marine Corps Air Station Beaufort, Beaufort, South Carolina], how was the training there?
Speaker 2: The training at, at, at Camp--Parris Island [Marine Corps Recruit Depot Parris Island, Parris Island, South Carolina], when I went there (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Rough, tough.  And I loved it.  It helped to mold and shape me as a man.  And it's ironic, my grandnephew went to boot camp recently, and I won't name him, and he was there for three days and he couldn't stand it.  He called his mother, "I can't take it.  I'm going to kill myself."  Like, what?  You know, I mean, this was back in the '60s [1960s].  This is shortly after a Marine drill instructor had marched some folks into the swamp.  But the training was rough and tough.  I mean, we'd get up five miles running break--before breakfast, you know, and shooting rifle and, and, and the training and, and, and standing at attention learning and where the--great for me!  It made me, it, it, it just like polished me.  What Mosetta Smalls [Brewington's mother] didn't polish, the coal, piece of coal that she gave to the [U.S.] Marine Corps as I've told them, we gone make a diamond out of you.  And they made a diamond out of me and I loved it.  And I didn't love combat in Vietnam.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you, you did the work.  You did your training.
Speaker 2: Yes ma'am.
Speaker 1: And then you, what was your second post after--
Speaker 2: After I left boot camp, Camp Lejuene [Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune, Jacksonville, North Carolina], Beaufort, South Carolina.  I went from Parris Island, went home for thirty days.  Beaufort, South Carolina, 1st Marine, 2nd Marine air wing [2nd Marine Aircraft Wing], Camp Lejuene for a hot minute and then I went up to Marine Barracks [Washington, D.C.] at 8th [Street] and I [Street], yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, so how many, how, how--what's the racial composition of your, you know, of, of the different--
Speaker 2: Well at that time, of course--
Speaker 1: --troops?
Speaker 2: --white was the majority.  There were in my platoon, I have a picture of it over there, there were maybe ten blacks in the platoon of 150, 100.  But, you know, the Marine Corps was interesting.  The drill instructor was equally hard on everybody.  He said, "We don't care what your color is, your color is Marine Corps green (makes sound)."  And that's how he raised--I mean he was just hard on the blacks.  He didn't call us the N word.  He didn't do that.  But he was as hard as, on whites and Hispanics as he was on black, and it was good.
Speaker 1: I know you were (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I hated him (laughter).
Speaker 1: I, I interviewed, I think Earl Graves [HistoryMaker Earl G. Graves, Sr.] was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes he was, yes, yes.
Speaker 1: --in the Marines, 'cause he talks--
Speaker 2: I got a picture of me and him over there.
Speaker 1: --about that, you know, all the time.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: So when, when you end up doing that duty at the White House [Washington, D.C.]--
Speaker 2: Yes ma'am.
Speaker 1: --can you talk about that?
Speaker 2: Yes.  That was wonderful for me to be standing in, on the White House lawn and the president of the United States and other foreign dignitaries would walk by me.  The queen of England, I mean this is like whoa!  You know, wow!  You know, and then we, you know, it was wonderful.  I mean it was a opening of an experience where I met, later on in life, a number of other people of that charac- of that ilk, but for me was an eye--President Lyndon Baines Johnson was the president at that time and yeah, I, I did flag details.  I'd hold a flag, one of a number of people or I'd be in a ceremonial guard that hold my rifle at, at parade rest or present arms and he'd come by and what not.  It was remarkable, in deed.
Speaker 1: And there it's the look, it's the buffing of the shoes (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: --everything.
Speaker 2: Yeah, all that.  I loved it.
Speaker 1: Pressed and--
Speaker 2: I loved it.
Speaker 1: --you know.
Speaker 2: You know, you step down into, you know, that, that the Marines at 8th and I were the only ones in the Marine Corps allowed to wear white trousers.  And I have a picture of that too.  You had to step down into it.  I mean everything was spit and polish.  And again, to me, it was just a lot of what my mother [Mosetta Smalls] taught me.  Again, my mother's life experiences carried me over.  Other guys would be complaining about spit shining their shoes.  I was like, "Please, are you serious?"  This is nothing.  And I'd spit shine my shoes.  I was proud of my appearance, you know, I was on, the on- the first, one of the first blacks on the front row.  I knew I was there.  I knew people were looking at me.  I felt as if I was representing the race.  So I had to be strong.  I had to look sharp.  I had to be standing tall looking good.  I knew it, and I did it and I loved it!
Story_ID: 637109
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now what did--how did Vietnam come about though?
Speaker 2: Oh boy.
Speaker 1: Because this is, you go off to Vietnam.
Speaker 2: Yes ma'am.
Speaker 1: So you go off in--
Speaker 2: Nineteen sixty-seven [1967].
Speaker 1: --sixty-seven [1967].
Speaker 2: Yes ma'am.  My platoon commander said to me, I was hoping after my--two year tour, that was a two year tour.  Vietnam [Vietnam War] was raging at that time and that was a two year tour, you were guaranteed to stay on the President's honor guard [Marine Presidential Guard] once you did you, once you got there, which kept me out of combat early.  So I thought I would go to Quantico, Virginia [Marine Corps Base Quantico], and kind of skate Vietnam and kind of move on the rest of my life.  But no, my platoon commander said to me one day, "Ah, Corporal Brewington [HistoryMaker Rudolph Brewington], you haven't had any combat," and he sent me to Vietnam.  And that was an eye opener, I mean you know, to see people be around you and they die, they get killed and you're shooting at people and they're shooting back at you.  It was a, it was a religious experience for me because it strengthened my faith in God.  I mean, you know, everybody is scared.  Everybody is afraid of dying and you see death around you and it doesn't touch you.  But something did happen in Vietnam that was interesting.  The day Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was killed, April 4, 1968, I was in Vietnam.  I was serving this country, on patrol and we came back and we heard that Martin Luther King had been, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., had been killed.  And so, us black Marines [U.S. Marine Corps] got together to hold a memorial service and all of a sudden we heard this clank, clank, clank, clank, clank and it was Marines on an armored personnel carrier pointing weapons at us telling us to break up this unlawful and treasonous, that was the word, treasonous assembly, like what?  We're here to give respect to Martin Luther King, Jr.  And they pointed rifles at us and for a few days black and white Marines was like, you know, they were like aiming rifles at each other, the shots were fired at each other; they don't say that much about it but it happened.  You know, and I came back from Vietnam angry, politicized.  I didn't want to deal with the [U.S.] military ever again in my life, ever.  That changed later on.
Speaker 1: Well then it was a hard time in many ways--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and so you're there, 'cause emotions are popping over here but, I want to--so what other, can you describe--because you were there a year?
Speaker 2: Yes ma'am, thirteen months.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So where were you?  There are thirteen?
Speaker 2: Thirteen months (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Story_ID: 637110
Speaker 1: Where were you, where were you stationed?
Speaker 2: Primarily in Da Nang [Vietnam] in I--what they call I Corps [I Corps Tactical Zone].  But I had to move around to other places.
Speaker 1: There was a lot of activity in Da Nang, wasn't there (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah in, we were getting rocket rounds and mortar rounds regularly.  We were under combat fire all the time.  And I, you know, I'm, I'm living in a bunker in the mud and blood and my own excrement, you know, and you, you know, you're getting C rations.  They throw a box of food at you and it's got C rations in it and, you know, you're shooting out.  You don't know who you're shooting at.  Nobody--at that time they didn't explain the geopolitical situation, the strategic value of all, all this, you just shoot, you know, you just shoot.  And I got out of there and I didn't, you know, there's that movie 'Waiting to Exhale'.  I didn't exhale until I was on the plane and I looked outside the window and saw the South China Sea and after thirteen months I went (makes sound).  I could relax.  And I came back from Vietnam.
Speaker 1: How many of your troop didn't make it?
Speaker 2: A number of my people didn't make it when--in fact, one of my best friends, Henry Robinson [Henry M. Robinson, Jr.], who I knew at Marine Barracks [Washington, D.C.] 8th [Street] and I [Street], another black.  He came to visit me in Vietnam.  He was in Vietnam before I was and we sat there one night in a machine gun nest.  I was standing guard duty and we were talking about our plans after we get back to, to, to the world, that's what we called the United States.  There is a, there's a scene in the movie 'Platoon' where there's a black guy that says to, to, to, to Charlie Sheen, "When you get back to the world everything else for the rest of your life is gravy, gravy, okay?"  We were talking about having our gravy back in the world and dancing and all that and Rob stepped on a Bouncing Betty and it took off his legs and other parts of his body.  That hurt, that hurt a lot.  His name is up on the wall, the Vietnam wall [Vietnam Veterans Memorial, Washington, D.C.].  That hurt a lot, you know?  And I learned a lot about death and I learned a lot about life.  Like I said, you never lived 'til you almost died.
Speaker 1: Now where's Ron [Brewington's brother, HistoryMaker Ronald H. Brewington] at this time?
Speaker 2: Ron was back in the states.  He was in the [U.S.] Navy but he was in the states.  He never went into Vietnam.
Speaker 1: Now the, the, the, the Marines [U.S. Marine Corps], so were the Marines' role versus the [U.S.] Army's role in Vietnam?
Speaker 2: Well (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) How did they, 'cause--
Speaker 2: It was, it was comingled.
Speaker 1: --the Marines (unclear)--
Speaker 2: It was comingled.  I mean the Marines are America's amphibious force.  But the Marines would, would, would take it, were assigned to what they called I Corp which is the northern most part next to North Vietnam.  The Army was down south Saigon [Vietnam].  I never got down to Saigon.  That was the Army--that was there area down there.  Our area was up here, theirs was down there.  So we had similar roles in terms of, combat and what not.  They did their combat thing down there and we did our combat thing up north.
Story_ID: 637111
Speaker 1: With your troop [of the U.S. Marine Corps] were there a lot of interrelationships with Vietnam women?
Speaker 2: Did I have relationships with Vietnam women?
Speaker 1: No, I'm saying did, did (laughter), you can answer if you--
Speaker 2: Of course I had relationships with Vietnam women.  I was a man (laughter).  You know, come on.  Yes I had relationships with them.  You know, it was not of a loving relationship.  It was a paid relationship, you know, we were men and at that time, you know, you're young and the hormones are jumping and so you do that, you know.  But you didn't, you know, I didn't see any black women.  The only time, the only--you know how many black women I saw in thirteen months?  One!  And her name was Barbara McNair and she was with the Bob Hope show ['The Bob Hope Christmas Special'] that came in December of 1967 to Da Nang [Vietnam].  She was the only black woman I saw the entire time I was in Vietnam.  So yes, I, yeah I, I had no problem.  But I wasn't doing nothing nobody else wasn't doing (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 2: We were men, we're men.
Speaker 1: Now, but you know, some people actually formed relationships with the women (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well no, I didn't form--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --no, no, no.
Speaker 1: They, they did that 'cause there are a lot of, you know, there's, well anyway some people formed relationships.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, I didn't, I, I, we didn't do it (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So, so your thirteen months are over and you're back.
Speaker 2: Yes ma'am.
Story_ID: 637112
Speaker 1: And so you then--you, you're discharged?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And you're angry (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I'm angry.
Speaker 1: You said you're angry--
Speaker 2: Angry, politicized, you know, we were treated like dogs when we came in the airport, called baby killers and people spitting at us and all and I'm like, "Well come on now.  You--I didn't see you over there," you know.  And so yeah, I came back and, you know, angry at, not the government, just at the, just at being there (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well you're--
Speaker 2: --and going through it.
Speaker 1: You, you, you were caught in between 'cause there's a lot anger at Vietnam [Vietnam War]--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and then the people who went over there and--
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: --and so you're caught in between.  So do you then decide to go--you don't really go to school at that point, right?
Speaker 2: No, not initially, no.  I, I, I started working.  I had a girlfriend who I had met prior to going to Vietnam, Sharon [ph.], my first wife, and she wrote me the entire time I was there.  And when I came back I, we got together and I, we married.  And I worked a number of jobs.  One of the first jobs I worked was working at National Airport [Washington National Airport; Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, Washington, D.C.] loading and unloading planes.  That was an exhausting job.  I mean, you know, it was funny when people, when the plane lands and people get back to, to the carousel they immediately want their--"Where is my luggage?"  You know, so I mean, you know, you were running to throw this, get this luggage on time, okay?  I, I was a cab driver, a truck driver.  I worked anything.  I remember one time I, I was a, I was working a route, a route salesman where I was selling sodas.  That's another hard job and you got this truck filled with sodas and you got to stop at these stores and unload these cases and bring 'em down, sometimes downstairs in the basement and what not.  And I was a bus driver.  I drove the bus in D.C. transit [Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority] in Washington, D.C. and one day I drove past a radio station and I said, "I can do this."  And it was again the Civil Rights Movement and I, and my awareness, was aware, my awareness was elevated about civil rights.  I said, "This is a way I can get into the media in a way that, this is a way that I can work from the inside to help change minds," and what not.  And so I, I went into this radio station and a gentleman who, he's passed, one of the, you know, there--in life you have many people who influence you, who help you along the way.  God sends them.  Carl Ferguson was this man.  He let me come into the radio station without education, without any background and he taught me how to read wire copy and rewrite copy.  And he put me on the radio on the air and it was exhilarating and I worked at the time for black stations initially.  You know, that's and that's a change today.  Today black stations don't have many newsrooms.  And I was a news reporter for the black stations and it was wonderful.  It--I got a lot of my anger out by putting out news and information about this wrong and this wrong and this right, you know, and so I did that.  And then I went to work for a couple of white stations, WWDC Radio in, in, in Washington which was the, the premier news station.  I developed a reputation as being one of the top street reporters in Washington, D.C.  Well, again without an education.  So I went to the University of Maryland [College Park, Maryland] to take radio and TV communications at night.  I worked in the day and went to school at night.  And then one day somebody again, Dr. Joe [ph.], Joe, I forget his name, came and told me about an accelerated degree program at what was then called Federal City College [University of the District of Columbia, Washington, D.C.].  So I was able, without a bachelor's degree, to go work for a master's degree.  And I did.  And I got this master's degree and it like; it opened doors for me because I had credentials then.  It opened doors.  It allowed me to go in the [U.S.] military, 'cause I went back in the military.  I said to myself, "Well, they used me, let me use them."

Speaker 1: Now how long did it take you to really sort of decompress from, you know (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Vietnam [Vietnam War]?
Speaker 1: --Vietnam, because I remember friends, you know, they would go the Fourth of July, go diving--
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: --you know, because they were having flash backs and--
Speaker 2: Yes ma'am.  I understand, you know, a lot of our veterans do have it from (unclear) Afghanistan and what not, Iraq and in Vietnam, post-traumatic stress syndrome [post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)].  I was fortunate that way.  Maybe it was because I had seen bodies before in Harlem [New York, New York] on the ground.  But I was able to come back and maintain my mental integrity.  I didn't, you know, for a minute I, but, and I didn't talk about it, for a minute I was like that, you know, you, but you relax.  You learn to relax and you go yeah ok you've been through that now move on with the rest.  You get--that's why I tell a lot of Vietnam veterans, I meet guys today and they telling me, "Hi, how are you doing? I am a Vietnam veteran."  And I say, "I am a Vietnam veteran too."  But you got to close that door.  You got to learn to move on with the rest of your life and a lot of us--and I've worked with her, I worked for an organi- I worked, right now I'm on the executive board of the Nevada chapter of the national association of black veterans [National Association for Black Veterans].  And I work with veterans and talk to them and say, "Look, you did your [U.S.] military service now make the most of it like I did.  Go to school.  Get back to school.  Get that education.  Get a commission.  Improve yourself.  Turn--get that G.I. Bill [Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944] money.  Do--take advantage of that.  They used you, you use them.  Okay?"  And that's what I did and I was able for a number of years to have a dual profession.  On one, on one side I was a reserve public affairs officer in the [U.S.] Army for a hot minute and then in the [U.S.] Navy.  I got a commission.  And I was also a journalist.  I worked for NBC News, covered the White House [Washington, D.C.], Capitol Hill [Washington, D.C.], you know, tr- you know, white--the whole thing, and then--.  But I was able to balance the both of them.
Story_ID: 637114
Speaker 1: Let's talk about that because on the media side there is, you know, people are coming into newsrooms--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --at this time.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So that's why I'd like you to talk about that period because people didn't really have to have training.  There was, you know, I mean things were erupting in the--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --in the cities.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: And a lot of people, especially around this time--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --you know, they're coming, the, the newsrooms are--because they don't have anyone to send out into the black--
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: --communities.
Speaker 2: So they sent black outs, black reporters.
Speaker 1: So they are sending blacks out.  So--but tell--so you were at--what was your first station you said?
Speaker 2: WUST [WUST Radio, Washington, D.C.], WOOK [WOOK Radio, Washington, D.C.], WWDC [WWDC Radio, Washington, D.C.], WRC [WRC Radio, Washington, D.C.], et cetera.  Yes, so--
Speaker 1: So who's the ownership?
Speaker 2: Well, it varied, I mean you know, W--
Speaker 1: Of the different ones.
Speaker 2: Well there were different, they were different owners of--white.  NBC, of course being NBC what it was.  Yeah, I was, yeah, as a black person, yeah, I was sent out to go into the black community to, to, to, to, to, to cover things but I didn't think of it as bad.  I was glad that--I would rather myself go in 'cause I had an understanding, a sympathy and an understanding, an empathy for what was going on to report as opposed to some, some person, other person of another ilk who may not be as sensitive.  And then a lot of times I had to correct my colleagues like, "Come on now that's not what's happening, that ain't what, that ain't the way it is, you know, and that's the way it is," as Walter Cronkite use to say.  "No that ain't the way it is, okay?  This is the way it is." S-
Speaker 1: But, but there is still a lot--these newsrooms are somewhat tense 'cause just, just because they open the door, racism (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --did you experience?  In the instances you're talking about, those four, four stations.
Speaker 2: Minimal, minimal.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Because they, they (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What were, were you free, I mean, were they, were you employees or were you contractors?
Speaker 2: I was a free employee.  But because of my expertise and my ability, thank you Lord, I was able to be on the same par if not better than a lot of my colleagues of any ilk.  So they respected me.  My news directors would, would be give me carte blanche.  I'd have a news car.  I'd drive around the city and report on news events and it, be it at the FCC [Federal Communications Commission] or the White House [Washington, D.C.] or here on the street or whatever.  I remember one of the, one time I was riding back from Howard University [Washington, D.C.] and I saw a police car drive all up on the sidewalk and I was like, "Huh."  So my reportorial antennae went up.  I turned around and followed him.  Pulled up to a house on 16th Street in Washington, D.C., and ran inside and there were bodies all over the place.  And the cop said to me, "Who, who are you?"  I said, "Media."  He said, "Get out."  Of course, it was a crime scene and I went outside and went to my news car and reported it.  I was a reporter who broke that story.  It was a house owned by Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, then of the Milwaukee Bucks, and this was his people, the Hanafi Muslims.  You may have heard of that situation.  And when I got there I saw the guys that did killing running down the street, guns in hands.  You know, I couldn't identify 'em but they were running the street, you know.  And so I was well known and respected in Washington.  I didn't have much racism when it came to that.  And, of course, by being in the media when I went to see people and interview people, "Hi, [HistoryMaker] Rudolph Brewington, NBC News."  "Right, come in, entrez, entrez-vous," you know, I could go in and then I would talk to them.
Story_ID: 637115
Speaker 1: I wasn't stationed there [White House, Washington, D.C.].  I would get a pass to go there for a particular event.  But I didn't see any other blacks there, you know, and so it got better and better and better.
Speaker 2: So who, who are the other people in the media?
Speaker 1: That I interacted with?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Oh, you name 'em.  Ed Bradley, oh come on, [HistoryMaker] Maureen Bunyan, in Washington, J.C. Hayward on a national level, I mean like I said, Ed Bradley.  I, I, I met a lot of 'em.  Bill Raspberry [HistoryMaker William Raspberry] in the media side, I mean the newspaper side.  I got to be friends with a lot of them.  What's his name?  Milton, [HistoryMaker] Milton Coleman at The Washington Post.  There was that--remember that issue there related to Janet [Janet Cooke], whatever her last name was, where she made up this story--
Speaker 2: She plagiarized [sic.].
Speaker 1: --yes, yes indeed.  I was, I was a talk show host at that time, WOL Radio [Washington, D.C.] owned by [HistoryMaker] Cathy Hughes, my dear friend and a pioneer in her own right.  She was supposed to come on my show that morning.
Speaker 2: Now was--did Cathy own the station at that time, she and Dewey Hughes?
Speaker 1: Yes, both.  They bought WOL Radio.  They, they literally lived in the station.
Speaker 2: No, no, I understand 'cause actually there were people like, I mean, Herb Wilkins [HistoryMaker Herbert P. Wilkins, Sr.] who was from Syncom [Syncom Venture Partners] was her investor.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: And, and, you know, and, and the thing--but Dewey Hughes wasn't there that, that long right, he (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) No, they broke up.
Speaker 2: --didn't he, they broke up.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: The other thing is, what about people like [HistoryMaker] Roger Wilkins.  Are you--'cause, you know, he, he had worked on the Watergate.
Speaker 1: Right.  I mean, I, I would see these individuals, you know, but they were competing media and we were all friendly.  All the black reporters that I interacted with, we were all friendly even though we were compet- competitors.  Yeah, I saw him, you know, "Hi how are you doing guy and, you know, if I can help you in any way to get a story," 'cause I give them information.  We'd exchange information back and forth because we wanted to all keep our jobs and all help each other, you know, in a way that everybody else was doing.  Okay, there was nothing, there was nothing unique about what we were doing.  White reporters were talking to other white reporters.  You know, you go to the White House for example, you walk in the door, you don't know what the heck is going on but somebody comes up to you and they say well da, da, da, da, da, da, da, we were doing the same thing.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  But that's not like being part of the White House press corps either (unclear)--
Speaker 1: No, no.  I, I--
Speaker 2: --right?  So--
Speaker 1: --like I said, I was there sporadically.
Speaker 2: But there are things that--'cause we're doing this whole project--
Speaker 1: Um hum.
Speaker 2: --one of the reasons for interviewing you, is that we've been interviewing, we're going to, we're, we got funding actually through Herb Wilkins--
Speaker 1: Oh, good.
Speaker 2: --to interview a hundred, two hundred of the nation's top media.  And so we've been interviewing, Milton, all those people we've interviewed.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, and so we're about 50 percent of the way through--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --of the interviews, but I don't really even know if you--by that time I'm wondering is Leon Dash [HistoryMaker Leon DeCosta Dash] I, he (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I knew Leon.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: I knew him.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: I, [HistoryMaker] Richard Prince, LaBarbara Bowman at The Washington Post, you know, Bruce Johnson at Channel 9 [WUSA-TV, Washington, D.C.], [HistoryMaker] Jim Vance at Channel 4, WRC-TV [Washington, D.C.], he's been there, he's an icon.  I hope you, I hope you interview him 'cause he's the guy.  I, he was one of the first African--there was, we use to make a joke; you could hold a convention of African American reporters when I first started in a telephone booth because there were just that few of us.  And so we were very close with each other and very supportive of each other, that kind of thing and, and, and, and, and now there were the money people.  I didn't really deal with the money people.  I was a reporter.  I mean I went to work every.  I was an employee, went to work, did my job every day.  I mean, you know, but I had many experiences, covered many interesting events, the pope, shootings, drug trade.  I even did a series called, the m- called, mino- d- what is it called?  It was called 'Diagnosis: Desperate, A Report on Minority Healthcare' for which I won a Kennedy, a Robert F. Kennedy Journalism Award and it outlined, long before anybody got into it, the ills in the black community and the problems--
Speaker 2: What year is this?
Speaker 1: --this is circa, I wanna say '75 [sic. 1974] something like that.
Speaker 2: I've won an award--
Speaker 1: Oh, you're getting ahead of me--
Speaker 2: I'm sorry.
Speaker 1: --'cause I'm still on, I'm in the '60s [1960s] (unclear).
Speaker 2: Okay.  I'm sorry.  But I, I loved it, I loved breaking stories.  I love opening events, educating people, giving them information that they didn't have or didn't know about it; and I loved it.  It was, it, it was just, just me, I mean, it, it, it just brought out the best of me, you know.
Story_ID: 637116
Speaker 1: So if you--'cause there's, but there's still a lot of, I mean, unless in--if you're in the black press that's a different thing.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: You know, but if you're in the white press there's still a lot of racism--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --going on--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and, and so you're operating at the beginning in the black press.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Not all, but I mean W, you were at WOL [WOL Radio, Washington, D.C.] longer, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  How long were you there?
Speaker 2: I was about, there about approximately a year as a talk show host, but this came later on in my career.  This was after I had done these other things like that you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But I think, you know, I didn't think [HistoryMaker] Cathy Hughes, had she--I don't think, had she--I thought her, maybe it was the late '70s [1970s].  I thought it was in the '80s [1980s] that she did the deal with (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, yes.  That sounds about right.
Speaker 1: --WOL.
Speaker 2: Yes, you know, that sounds about right.
Speaker 1: Because--now are you familiar with people or are you hearing about Pluria Marshall [HistoryMaker Pluria Marshall, Sr.]?
Speaker 2: Yes, I know Pluria.  I worked with him often on the issues.  He had to deal with blacks in the media and black issues in the media, black ownership of stations, that kind of thing.  Yeah, I, I worked with Pluria all the time and I would, you know, I, I'd have him on my talk show to talk about the rules, the FCC [Federal Communications Commission], the racism in the media, why black people should, you know, should have more stations, dah, dah, dah, dah and all, yes that was all part of my, my thing.  I would bring, you name 'em.  I brought everybody on my show, on my radio shows from the KKK [Ku Klux Klan] to, you know, the Black Panthers [Black Panther Party], I mean, you know, you name 'em, I brought 'em on and to give them an outlet to speak.  You know, D.C. [Washington, D.C.] mayor, [HistoryMaker] Marion Barry, was a frequent guest on my, frequent guest on my show because I, I, I'd give them a--and particularly when the white media was jumping all over him and not letting him, and slanting what he was saying, I would bring him on so that he could have his own, you know, to say, say just, just talk.  I'm not, I'm, I'm being objective.
Speaker 1: Now did you--tell me the difference though.  What were black radio stations like (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) What were they like?
Speaker 1: In the, you know, in the, what I mean just--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --because that's still--but what were they like management wise in the, in, we're talking about the late '70s [1970s].  So what was the management of them like 'cause some, some had black formats but they were white owned.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So tell me what they were like and what sort of experience and how the programming day broke out, that type of thing.
Speaker 2: Well, you, you, you said it correctly.  I mean these, these were black formatted stations but they were white owned.  I mean for example, WOOK [WOOK Radio, Washington, D.C.] was owned by Richard Eaton.  He was one of the first whites to bring black music to the, to the black, he saw that niche and he filled it.  By and large as I remember though 'cause I was again an employee, they were interested in one thing, ratings and money and advertising dollars.  That was it.  As long as the rating were good--'cause in fact I wrote an article one time talking about the war between WOL Radio and WOOK.  These were the two major black power houses in Washington, D.C., musically.  And they both had the best disc jockeys and the best music and they were at war with each other musically and for the hearts and the minds of the black community in Washington.
Speaker 1: So, so when was that, who were the disc jockeys--
Speaker 2: Disc jockeys?  At WOL you had people like [HistoryMaker] Bobby Bennett the Mighty Burner, Sunny, Sunny Lis- Sonny, Sunny what was his name Sunny.  At--WLU [sic. WOL Radio, Washington, D.C.] had Terrible Turk [John "Terrible Turk" Edwards"], Soul Papa [R. Seavy] who later was killed, and that made a change in me because I wanted to be a disc jockey at first.  I, I saw they had all the girls and they had, they were stars in their own right and then one day he got killed ostensibly because of payola and I just like, "Oop don't think I want to do that."  But Soul Papa, Terrible Turk, A.C. [A.C. Williams], James Jack, Charlie Neal, I mean these were, these, these guys were like gods in, in, in, in D.C.  I mean people loved them.  Like I said, Mighty Burner, Sunny Jim , "Sunny Jim" Kelsey that was his name, Kelsey, the Night Hawk [Bob "Nighthawk" Terry] another guy that was, was killed and we never heard from him and they never found his body.  So I, I was with--I was fortunate in my life in that I was there in the beginnings of a lot of black broadcasting efforts.  So I saw the best of the best.  Frankie Crocker was there for a minute, I mean I saw 'em all.  I got, I got to work with 'em and interact with them and, and, and like for example on WOOK every Wednesday morning they would have a disc jockey meeting, okay?  And so they would ask me to sit in as a disc jockey for about two hours.  And when Rudy Brewington [HistoryMaker Rudolph Brewington] came on the radio my theme song was by James Brown.  It was 'I don't Want Nobody to Give Me Nothing (Open Up the Door, I'll Get It Myself).'  That was my theme song.  When you heard that, Rudy Brewington was on the radio.  And I use to play all the music.  Nobody told me what to play.   I just played what I liked.  It was fun.  It was wonderful times, wonderful times.  Now as far as, like I said, the management they were only concerned with ratings, you know.  The, the, the ratings, you saw the movie, Petey, about Petey Greene and all that.
Story_ID: 637117
Speaker 1: I mean and, and so I, I knew Petey Greene and--
Speaker 2: He was at, he was at--
Speaker 1: WOL [WOL Radio, Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 2: --WOL, right.
Speaker 1: Yes ma'am. Yeah.  He was, he was a convict. Yeah, you know, you know his life story.  Beautiful man, beautiful man.  I would never forget Petey Greene.  In all the people that I met in my time, I, I mean as I look back over my life and look at the people who I knew and met in the industry, it was phenomenal.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I think, I think Dewey Hughes had something to do with that movie ['Talk To Me'] though 'cause he was the subject (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yes, yes, yes.
Speaker 2: --of it but I think he had something (unclear)--
Speaker 1: He had a big, a major part because--
Speaker 2: Yeah 'cause--
Speaker 1: --he was the one--
Speaker 2: --we're hoping to interview him.
Speaker 1: Oh you might.  You have his phone number and everything?
Speaker 2: Unh-uh.
Speaker 1: I got it.
Speaker 2: Okay, yeah.
Speaker 1: Or Ron [Brewington's brother, HistoryMaker Ronald H. Brewington] has it too.
Speaker 2: Or maybe we were in touch and he's writing a book.  I'm not sure.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Writing a book.
Speaker 1: Beautiful man.  I also worked at WRC-TV [Washington, D.C.] at, at, on a show called 'The Place.'  It was a black community affairs program channel and it was an NBC affil- owned and operated station.  Sue Simmons who became, you know, a big, a big icon in New York [New York].  She, me and a guy named [HistoryMaker] Glenn Harris, he did the sports, he's now a big star in Washington [D.C.], and I was the commentator.  And we all worked together for Dewey and it was a well--it was called 'The Place.'  It was a well, highly rated show, well viewed, well liked, well respected, you know.  And I did 'America's Black Forum' with Glen Ford and others who started that program.  It was the only, the first black owned, black interview talk show.
Speaker 2: Now was this before [HistoryMaker] Julian Bond starts hosting it?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yes.  The original host (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So this is the original host.
Speaker 1: Right.  The original host was Glen Ford.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And you--there are pictures of me up there.  He and I both.  I was on--I was the announcer:  "This is America's Black Forum, an examination of the issues facing black America.  Our guest today [HistoryMaker] Rudolph Brewington."  You know, I mean, I was the, I was the voice, voice of it and I also sat on the panel.  We interviewed everybody, Senator Brooke [HistoryMaker Edward Brooke], I mean we, we, we made major news every broadcast, you know, we, we had everyone on.  It was, and I, then I got off to Howard University TV.  I had my own TV talk show there ['Evening Exchange'].  So I've done radio talk shows.
Speaker 2: So who was managing WHUT [WHUT-TV, Washington, D.C.] at the time that you--
Speaker 1: Howard University [Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 2: No, no but I mean who was the station manager at the time?
Speaker 1: Oh god.  His name escapes me but he's still there.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Is--well on the radio side?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Oh yes, he is.
Speaker 1: And [HistoryMaker] Cathy Hughes, of course, was the general manager at WHUR [WHUR Radio, Washington, D.C.] at the time.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And they had Melvin, Melvin Lindsey, 'The Quiet-' he was the, the, the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) 'The Quiet Storm.'
Speaker 1: 'The Quiet Storm.'  I mean I knew all these people.  These were all my friends.  It was wonderful.  It's been a, God has blessed me.  It has been a wonderful career.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  There was--so, I mean, because in Chicago [Illinois], (cough) you know, though a little earlier really--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --WVON [WVON Radio, Chicago, Illinois] had played a big role in, you know, on black radio.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: But they were the only, I think, twenty-four hour.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Donnie Simpson, I worked with Donnie Simpson.  I worked, you name 'em, I worked with the best of 'em as a news man, colleague.
Story_ID: 637118
Speaker 1: But you--so this is what--so I have that you're doing that.  Now what about the, the--what I'm trying to put in order is when you work with the Radio-TV Monitoring Service [Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 2: Yes.  I took (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So what--
Speaker 2: --a break
Speaker 1: Huh?
Speaker 2: I took a break from broadcasting.
Speaker 1: Yeah, but what, what year is that?
Speaker 2: I think it's 1979, 1980, somewhere around there.  I think (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay. And so is that because really it's hard to get paid too much.  You're not getting paid a huge amount.  You can be around people but you weren't--
Speaker 2: No, I think it was just an offer.  I took a break from broadcasting and I got a job offer to be vice president of this place.  This was a company whose job it was, as they say, to monitor radio and TV stations.  They would tape every broadcast and different corporations and government agencies and what not, and individuals would come and buy the tapes and/or the transcripts.
Speaker 1: That's right (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 1: --that's right.  They still do that--
Speaker 2: Yes, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: --I mean, yeah, 'cause--
Speaker 2: And so I was vice president of the one in Washington, D.C.
Speaker 1: So what did that entail?
Speaker 2: That ent- well for me it entailed directing a group of people who monitored the shows, collected the tapes when we get a request for an order from, let's say, the state department [U.S. Department of State] or the White House, the president is speaking, you know, this before White House had, you know, the age of the Internet where you had your, your own website.  We would provide snippets of the president and other officials to, to, for record purposes and just f- for general purposes.
Speaker 1: Do you know how those businesses got started because, you know, we often now, you know, now especially now--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --stations are not necessarily, you know, 'cause you could, used to get, be able to get a tape.  So when, do you know the history of those, those types of services (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No ma'am.
Speaker 1: --and when they gotten started?
Speaker 2: Not, not specifically.  I, I knew that when, when they had one in Washington, D.C., I knew about it, I heard about it and when they made me a job offer of being vice president, I said, "Hey I'll take it."  The salary was good, you know.  One of the things that was--the, the one of the bad sides of broadcasting was the hours you worked.  I mean you'd be to work at two o'clock in the morning, three o'clock in the morning Christmas, holidays, you know.  On Christmas morning when you turn your TV or radio on you expect to hear somebody, well, it was me.  I was one of those folks that had to be there and so I said, "I needed a break from broadcasting."  And this job came up.  And so I, I--'cause I wanted to work nine to five, and I did work nine to five, you know.  And then I, then I got the radio bug back again.

Speaker 1: And then, well I have, you worked there [Radio-TV Monitoring Service, Washington, D.C.] probably for a year and then you beca- oh, I thought you joined Association Personnel [Association Personnel, Inc., Washington, D.C.] at that point.
Speaker 2: I did that too.  That was a company that, again, had taken a break from broadcasting.  I was the public affairs director for Associated Personnel.  This was, remember CETA [Comprehensive Employment and Training Act]?  The CETA program--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --where the government was funding black and other minority programs.  Well, I went in there to get people to work in the association community.  When people think of Washington [D.C.] they think of the government, the federal government and it is, the primary, the primary employer in Washington.  But the second largest employer in Washington, a lot of people don't know. is the association community, the National Association of--the National Rifle Association [NRA], the national association of education [National Education Association], the national association, you know, all these associations were headquartered there.  And what we did was we got a grant, a CETA grant to go out and teach primarily minority people.  And again this was wonderful because I could get folks in this area skills that would--and then direct them toward working in the association community, those unique skills, job sets, skill sets that they would need to work in the association community.  And we placed a number--we trained 'em and placed a number of people in associations and it changed their lives.  And it, it was what--I was like yeah. I was like (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You know, 'cause, so, the--can you explain about the CETA program a little bit more?
Speaker 2: Well the CETA program was a government program where basically they were paying African American and other minority groups funds to get educated, to, to upgrade and to give job skills to under, under privileged, under, you know, minorities to give them job skills to work in various different areas of the society.
Story_ID: 637120
Speaker 1: So when you--so what makes you join Sheridan Broadcasting [Sheridan Broadcasting Network]?  You joined in 1981 (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, I did.  Yes, I did.  Again, it was another job.
Speaker 1: How did you hear about it?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, it, its, its, you, you, in this case, you know what, what I was--thank you master--an amount of times people just called me.  "Hey Rudy [HistoryMaker Rudolph Brewington], I hear about you man.  Come on I got a job here for you." And (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, so talk about Sheridan Broadcasting a bit now.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Sheridan Broadcasting--
Speaker 1: --at the top.
Speaker 2: --was--Jerry Lopes called me one day and at the time it was called the Mutual Black Network and the Sheridan Broadcast.  Well, first it was the Mutual Black Network and then it became, when Ron Davenport [HistoryMaker Ronald Davenport] bought it from Mutual, it became the Sheridan Broadcasting Network.  They had offices in Washing- in Arlington, Virginia, cal- they stayed there with the Mutual Radio Network [Mutual Broadcasting System] and then they decided because the technology changed, they had like two hundred affiliate stations and so the technology changed from delivering the product, the news product, the news products, the sports cast, whatever products we had over telephone lines and we went to Cocoa Beach, Florida, where they had a contract with a guy who had a big satellite uplink dish.  And we did that.  We all moved, me, Ann Sawyer, Dave Clark [David Clark], we were the primary news anchors and then there were sportscasters and what not, and we all moved to Cocoa Beach, Florida, where we delivered the product up there, in fact the--I became the only African American who covered the space program in the entire International Press Corps.  I was the only one.  Jerry Lopes assigned it to me because of my [U.S.] military background.
Speaker 1: But we, we should talk about the significance.  Sheridan Broadcasting Network is different than, you know, a radio station.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So I just would like you to be more--because it's a news service (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It's a network, right. It's a news service.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  It's a network.  So it, was it a soft network?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Or a hard network?
Speaker 2: It was a hard network.  We delivered--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, but the affiliates were, how were the affiliates connected and where were those 230 affiliates located?
Speaker 2: They were located all over the nation.  They had a list of affiliates that ran from the A to Z.  We provided them on, on a, on a hour- regular basis, regular basis, hourly a network newscast which was predominantly black oriented, the news but on a, on a black scale.  Sportscasts, feature reports, et cetera.  And, and, and that was the ge- because whites, whites did the same thing.  I mean you've got the NBC Radio Network [NBC Radio News].  You had the CBS Radio Network [CBS News Radio] where they send to affiliate stations all over the country, and in some instances over the world now, different reports.  And we did that.  This was the first major black effort to do this.
Speaker 1: So how did Ron, how did the Davenports go about purchasing (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That I can't tell you.
Speaker 1: --Sheridan Broadcasting?
Speaker 2: I can't tell you.  I don't, I don't know.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You don't?  Okay.
Speaker 2: I don't know.
Speaker 1: And you don't know the hi- well at the time that you come in as the--you were talking about the Mutual Broadcast, it was Mutual Broadcasting Network and--
Speaker 2: Mutual, Mutual Black, Black Network--
Speaker 1: --Mutual Black Network.
Speaker 2: --which was part of the Mutual Broadcasting System.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So when does that ownership change?
Speaker 2: I, I can't tell you.  I, I jeez, I, I would--
Speaker 1: When you came on the--it was the Davenport.
Speaker 2: It was, it was the Sheridan Broadcasting Network (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: --at that point.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes, right.
Speaker 1: And do you know how long they had been in existence at that point?
Speaker 2: They had been in existence about a year when I came, before I came aboard.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And now they have changed, changed their name again.  They're now called the American Urban Radio Networks.  But we were the first major news anchors, Ann Sawyer in the morning; no, Dave Clark in the morning, Ann Sawyer in the afternoon and me in the evening.  And it was, it was, it was, it was another one of those wonderful experiences where I had total freedom.  Mr. Davenport, Jerry Lopes gave us total freedom to select what stories we wanted to tell, how to tell it.  They didn't, you know, nobody was up there.  We had complete free- which was rare in a radio network, believe me.
Story_ID: 637121
Speaker 1: So how are you, how is the news being sourced?  How is it being fed and sourced?  That's what I'm--'cause you said there were the different programming segments.  I'm just trying to understand the structure.
Speaker 2: When you sourced, what do you mean?
Speaker 1: Meaning how are you getting the news like--
Speaker 2: Okay.  Okay, we got the news from various sources.  We got it from the major wire services but we also got it from the emerging black radio wire services, okay?
Speaker 1: And who were the main, the emerging black, black services?
Speaker 2: BET [Black Entertainment Television] was one.  I, I can't remember at this point.  But we, we, we, we, we got those, and again it was freedom.  We had complete freedom.  UPI [United Press International], AP [Associated Press], you know that kind of, and the black sources and, you know, we had a White House correspondent, the first black regular, Bob Ellison, my dear friend who passed on.  April Ryan is now taking that position.  And he was there reporting from the White House [Washington, D.C.].  We had reporters in the field.  We had stringers in the field.  People who were not employees but, but, but, but on contract would provide us news reports about black issues all over the country.  And it was--our job was to package that material and then present it on the air.
Speaker 1: Right.  'Cause, I mean, everybody talks about how expensive news operations are (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah. I, I couldn't--
Speaker 1: So that's what I was asking.
Speaker 2: --yeah, I, I couldn't, I couldn't tell you in terms of the expense.  All I knew is I got a salary, that's all I knew.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you, you did that for how many years then?
Speaker 2: Approximately three years?  Approximately three years, yeah.
Story_ID: 637122
Speaker 1: So that would be like 1984?  'Cause I have--so what did you do after that?  That's what I'm, I'm s- trying to s- you know--
Speaker 2: After that I got recalled, recalled to active duty with the Navy.  That was circa 1990, okay?  Because after that I was recalled to active duty by the Navy during the first Persian Gulf War.  I was in the Pentagon [Arlington, Virginia].  I was a special assistant to the chief of information for the n- for the United States Navy.  And from about 1990--
Speaker 1: So did, did, did Ron [Brewington's brother, HistoryMaker Ronald H. Brewington]--where was he at that point?  Because (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Ron--
Speaker 1: --he had been in the Navy--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and you had been in the Marines [U.S. Marine Corps].
Speaker 2: Right.  Ron was working on the West Coast.  He was a stringer for Sheridan Broadcasting [Sheridan Broadcasting Network' American Urban Radio Networks].  He was the Hollywood correspondent for Sheridan Broadcasting and he worked for--stringing for other organizations, news organizations on the West Coast while I was on the East Coast.  Right.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  And so what, so what was the purpose of this, this position, 'cause the thing that we had around--I don't know if you knew Pete, it's Pete Tzomes, Tzomes, Tzomes [HistoryMaker Captain C.A. "Pete" Tzomes]?
Speaker 2: Pete Tzomes?
Speaker 1: Yes, he was director of Equal Opportunity Division [Equal Opportunity Division of the Bureau of Naval Personnel] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 1: --around--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --you know--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --that time.
Speaker 2: He was the captain, Captain Peter Tzomes.  Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Right, Cap- Captain Peter Tzomes.
Speaker 2: Right, I knew him.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Because he was appointed in 1988.
Speaker 2: Yes ma'am.  He was a submariner--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --who was appointed.  The Navy realized they had problems and the whole concept of diversity was coming in to play.  They realized they had racial issues to deal with so after Mr. Tzo- after Captain Tzomes left Commander Dave Brewer, David Brewer [David L Brewer III] took that position.  He later rose to become one of the first three star black admirals in the Navy.  I worked for him as a public affairs officer when I was a lieutenant--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --you know, but I was recalled to active duty circa 1990 and later after the war was over and it wound down I--they asked me to work at various other capacities.  I worked, for example, as public affairs officer for the National Naval Medical Center [Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, Bethesda, Maryland], the president's hospital. It's a wonderful job.
Story_ID: 637123
Speaker 1: Could we go back to when you're in the [U.S.] Navy?  So--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --what is the Navy, what is it like at this point?
Speaker 2: In the Navy?
Speaker 1: In the Navy.
Speaker 2: Well, I was a public affairs officer.
Speaker 1: I know, but I'm just saying period.
Speaker 2: Oh, racially?
Speaker 1: Because, I mean, public affairs office, they're taking care of public affairs (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 1: --and things like that but--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --what is, what is the Navy, what is the status of the Navy and opportunities for, for black people?  Because Navy came up last of all the, you know--
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: --I mean that, well that and the [U.S.] Coast Guard.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  To be honest, the Navy has had issues in its career, in its time.
Speaker 1: A lot of issues.
Speaker 2: Oh there were race riots aboard the aircraft carrier [USS Kitty Hawk].  There, there's still a lot of problems in the Navy but--
Speaker 1: But, but what were the issues that you were dealing with from a public relations standpoint when you were there.
Speaker 2: To be honest, I never dealt with any racial issues.
Speaker 1: Okay, but what were, what were some of the things that were--you were, you were handling?  I mean what was your job?  Let me put it that way (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay.  Like I said, my first, one of the jobs I had was public affairs officer at the National Naval Medical Center, Bethesda, Maryland [Walter Reed National Military Medical Center].  For example, one day I got a phone call from the British embassy in Washington [D.C.].  Princess Diana was in town.  And as you know one of her causes, campaigns was the eradication of land mines and she found out, I don't know how, but she found out that there was a patient in the hospital who was a victim of a land mine and she wanted to come and see him.  Well, I coordinated.  Next thing I know, me and my admiral were standing, standing tall at the front door, Rolls Royce rolls up with two Union Jack flags on it and the door opens and out steps Princess Diana.  "Hi, how you doing?"  So that was, you know, that was one of the jobs that I had.  I, I was also deputy director of public affairs for the Armed Forces Inaugural Committee.  We inaugurated President Clinton [President William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton].  That was a job where I was in charge of--I was second in command to a number of people who their job was to take care all the logistics and, and, and, and, and, and all the aspects of, of, of, of inaugurating a president.  See people for--don't understand or forget or don't know the armed forces have been inaugurating--has been an integral part of the inauguration since George Washington.  And so now the Armed Forces Inaugural Committee plays a key role in the inauguration of the president.  And so I did that.  I mean, and the reason I did all these things--that I worked in the Navy Media Center and I worked here and there and I worked.  And then eventually I got recalled to active duty for five years where I was first public affairs officer and then later director of the official quality of life website for the Navy and the [U.S.] Marine Corps called Lifelines.  I mean--so the Navy has always been like a backup for me and I've urged young men, African young men and women, you know, think about going in the reserve.  The Navy--you asked about the racial issues (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well I was not, I wasn't ask- I was asking about that since they were last coming in, but I was trying to understand what the Navy--'cause you had served in the Marines.
Speaker 2: Yes ma'am.
Speaker 1: And so what was the Navy like?  This is now almost fifteen years--
Speaker 2: Later.
Speaker 1: --later--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --you know, what is, what is--what was it like?
Speaker 2: It, it--conditions for African Americans had improved.  I must say that.  In the Marine Corps there was a degree, a large degree of racism.  There was a large degree of racism in the Navy, but through the efforts of people like Captain Tzomes [HistoryMaker Captain C.A. "Pete" Tzomes] and enlightened people like Admiral Zumwalt [Elmo Zumwalt] who is the chief of naval operations and, and--opened up opportunities and, you know, we didn't have to be, just be stewards in the Navy.  We could be public affairs officers.  We could be officers.  And so I took advantage of that and I tried--I'm personally responsible, I must tell you, I'm bragging here for bringing approximately thirty-five or more African American males and females into the Navy as commissioned officers.  I was notorious.  "You got a college degree?  Let's go.  Let's get in here and take advantage of this, they do.  Let's take advantage of this."
Speaker 1: So, so if you did that--so how many of those people, you know, ended up staying and having productive careers.
Speaker 2: I can't tell you that.
Speaker 1: Ok.
Speaker 2: You know, yeah because--
Speaker 1: You know, the other person that was, I think, there around that time--
Story_ID: 637124
Speaker 1: --Ended at school see--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So in the work we've been doing, we've been seeing like--we only, like I said, did two people in the [U.S.] Coast Guard--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --but we--that was another project--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --to interview--
Speaker 2: Okay, okay.
Speaker 1: --you know, people in the [U.S.] military.  So we've been really uncovering, you know--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --some wonderful--
Speaker 2: And you have to get Vice Admiral Howard [Michelle Howard], you have to.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She is the highest ranking African American woman in the United States Navy.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You see the Phillip, the movie about 'Captain Phillips' and all that?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: You know who gave the order for the Seals [U.S. Navy Seals] to fire?  Admiral Howard.
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: A lot of people don't--she was a cap- I've seen her go from captain to three star admiral.  You got to get Admiral Howard (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.  We would love to do that.
Speaker 2: Okay, if you go to navy.mil there's biographies of all the people.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, if you put us in touch that would be great.
Speaker 2: Yes ma'am.
Speaker 1: Okay. So, okay.
Speaker 2: We're not going to stop?
Speaker 1: Hold on.
Speaker 2: Are we going to stop?
Speaker 1: Yep, we are going to stop for a second.  Go on.
Speaker 2: You know it's funny, the military and yes, the Navy, as I said many times, has had its problems.  But it has taken affirmative action to correct those problems and to make opportunity equal for all.  In fact, the military is the most equal socie- segment of our society.  Okay?  People like Vice Admiral Howard can, can, come into the Navy and start out at a certain rank and rise through the basis of their own merit, there's a little politics here and there, but on the basis of their--it's a meritocracy.  You rise up.  You can do it.  When I'm out on the street--when I was in the street I'm a black man, just a black man.  But when I was in the military in the Navy and I wore a uniform, whether you liked me or not, you had to respect the rank on my shoulders.  I was Commander Brewington [HistoryMaker Rudolph Brewington] and that gave me a sense of freedom that I never had in my life.  It, I, I'm going to tell you, to be honest I felt like a Caucasian, that the, that the, the, the, the freedoms that they took for granted, the respect that they took for granted, all that; I had it in the Navy.  Nobody bothered me.  I was a free--I was able to come and--I was able to advise senior leaders, admirals.  I worked with, at--I worked at the highest levels of the Navy, assistant secretary of the Navy.  I mean--I was able to walk into his office and say, "Mr. Secretary," da, da, da, da, da, da.  I'll give you an example.  Now, Vice Admiral Brewer [David L. Brewer III], who I mentioned to you, retired, was a one star admiral in charge of the Military Sealift Command [U.S. Navy Military Sealift Command].  This is the command that has all the transport ships in the Navy, but they also have hospital ships, two of them, and one of 'em [USNS Comfort] was sitting there rusting at the pier in Baltimore [Maryland].  And I went by one day I was driving from--and I said, "You know--." I went back to the Navy Yard, the Washington Navy Yard [Washington, D.C.], and I walked in to Admiral Brewer's office, and said, "You know Admiral, we need to send that ship around the world and let it do some good and try to correct the ugly American syndrome."  This ship is a floating hospital, twelve operating suites, hundreds of beds.  I mean your state of the art, you know, you name it.  This ship--if you name it in any state of the art hospital, it's on this ship.  And Admiral Brewer did it.  And a lot people don't know two black guys, me and Admiral Brewer, caused that to happen.  That ship became what the secretary of defense would call the most important ship in the United States Navy because that ship when, when it went to--when it was a earthquake in Haiti, it was there.  There's a hospital ship right now in the Philippines.  I mean, it brought, and it made people--the only problem we had was diplomatic.  Some people were concerned that our doctors were more qualified than the other doctors and would make them look bad, but they got over that.  The name of the game is you help people.  We did that.  We--cleft lips.  We fixed all that.  Orthopedics, we fi- all that we did and it was beaut- I loved it.
Story_ID: 637125
Speaker 1: What were the issues of the day in the--you know, 'cause in 1990 who is president? It's (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) George Bush [President George Herbert Walker Bush].
Speaker 1: George Bush.  Okay.
Speaker 2: The senior, older--
Speaker 1: Um-hm--
Speaker 2: --George Bush.  Right?
Speaker 1: --the senior.  Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Um hum.  And we went to war in 1990, the Persian Gulf War.  Yes.
Speaker 1: Um hum.
Speaker 2: I was in the Pentagon [Arlington, Virginia] that night when we went from Operation Desert Shield to Desert Storm [Operation Desert Storm].
Speaker 1: So what is your role like in, in those in--what is the official capacity, 'cause--of, of you and, and in a public relations kind of way?
Speaker 2: At that, in that, for that conflict I was the special assistant to the chief of information of, of the [U.S.] Navy and my job was to be the liaison between the Navy and the [U.S.] Department of Defense.  And so in that capacity I worked with people like General Colin Powell [HistoryMaker General Colin L. Powell].  I worked with people like Pi- Pete Williams, NBC correspondent, who at the time was assistant secretary of defense for public affairs and my job was to provide informa- glean information from them and give it to the Navy.  And it would be distributed and disbursed, blessed information will be disbursed all over the, the, the, the world for that matter because we have public affairs offices all over the world.  And it was a very satisfying job.  Again, my color was not an issue.
Speaker 1: So who were you--what other parts of, of the government are you dealing with?
Speaker 2: I've dealt with; I've worked for the Immigration Service [U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services].  I was a public affairs--
Speaker 1: No, no, no, no, no, I'm saying in that position.
Speaker 2: In that position?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Well, I've dealt with the (unclear) with the Navy, [U.S.] Department of the Navy, the Department of Defense, [U.S.] Department of State.
Speaker 1: And who was, who was head of, who was depart- who was head of the Navy at that at--who?
Speaker 2: I'm sorry I can't remember.  It's on the record.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --okay.
Speaker 2: Okay.  It's been some time.
Speaker 1: Huh?
Speaker 2: It's been some time that has passed.
Speaker 1: Okay, yeah.  'Cause--yeah.  'Cause I think that's a little later that you have--when is Togo West [HistoryMaker Togo D. West, Jr.]?  Was Togo West--he was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Secretary of the [U.S.] Army.
Speaker 1: Secretary of defense--
Speaker 2: Of the Army.
Speaker 1: --of the Army.
Speaker 2: Yes ma'am.
Speaker 1: But that's under Clinton [President William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton].
Speaker 2: Under Clinton, right.
Speaker 1: And Clinton and then--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --you have Bill Cohen [William Cohen]--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --who was--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --I thought he was secretary of defense.
Speaker 2: No, see; remember Togo West was secretary of the Army (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Army and, and--
Speaker 2: --and, and, and Cohen was secretary of defense.  Right.
Speaker 1: --was secretary of defense.  Okay, yeah.
Speaker 2: Big difference.  Togo West worked for Cohen (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) For, for Cohen, yeah.  We've, we've interviewed both of them.
Speaker 2: I met him and a bunch of other folks.
Speaker 1: Um-hm, yeah--we've interviewed both of them.
Story_ID: 637126
Speaker 1: What happens with your ex-wife [Weida Tucker Richardson]?
Speaker 2: Which one (laughter)?
Speaker 1: Well, in 1944 [sic.].
Speaker 2: Oh, the surveillance, spying issue (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: --spy, okay.  What happened was--
Speaker 1: But wait.  I don't understand how this happens here and you are, you know, this is in Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania] and you are in D.C., so--
Speaker 2: No, that came afterwards.  The D.C. part came after.
Speaker 1: I see.  Okay.
Speaker 2: No, no, no, well okay, wait, wait let me stop.  I was in--yeah, yeah, right.  The Pittsburgh part came first.  That's why I left Pittsburgh and went to Washington, D.C., right (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, okay.  So you left Sheridan [Sheridan Broadcasting Network; American Urban Radio Networks]--
Speaker 2: Left Sheridan--
Speaker 1: --and went to Pittsburgh.
Speaker 2: --in Pittsburgh and then went to Washington, D.C.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  'Cause I had a divorce in, in, in, in, in, but what happened basically was my then wife, her attorney procured her to place a voice activated tape recorder under my bed and stage a rape scene.
Speaker 1: And stage a--
Speaker 2: A rape scene.  "Help, help, stop, stop!"  And I realized she wasn't talking to someone, she was talking to something.  And so I went upstairs and called the local police to go on a record to protect myself 'cause if you're a man in America, the woman screams rape you're in trouble.  "Did you penetrate her?"  "No."  "Did you stop when she said stop?"  I said, "Of course, I never touched her."  Fine, I went on the record to protect myself.  I then started, my reporter's antenna, I then started searching the house.  And about two weeks later in all these shoe boxes I found a voice activated tape recorder.  And once--it was one of the worst moments of my life.  But being the reporter that I was it, it, it, it got me curious.  I was like, "Does this happen to other people?"  And so, I started investigating and it happened to some prominent people.  I can't name their names.  I would rather not name their names.  They too had been victimized in this fashion.  And so I wrote this article called 'Domestic Surveillance: America's Dirty Little Secret' [Rudolph Brewington] and it spawned a number of things.  I appeared on a number of national talk shows: Donahue ['The Phil Donahue Show'], Oprah ['The Oprah Winfrey Show'], 'Geraldo,' Sally Jessy Raphael ['The Sally Jessy Raphael Show'; 'Sally'], Montel Williams ['The Montel Williams Show'], Jerry Springer ['The Jerry Springer Show'].  A bill was introduced in the United States Congress by then congressman, Ron Dellums [HistoryMaker Ronald Dellums].  A companion bill was introduced in the United States Senate.  A number of spy shops were closed, forced to close.  The [U.S.] Postal Service had to change its regulations to, to, to prohibit the mailing, which was illegal under federal law, of these devices through the mails.  And so, I used a personal misfortune as--again this goes back to my mother, you know, take ca- you know, do something for somebody, help somebody, you know, help.  That's what you're here for.   You're here to help.  Make the world a better place.  And that's why I did this.  And so I, I, I, I went around the country, I mean, I went on these talk shows to--as a privacy advocate and as a privacy victim to, to, to expose this issue, this happenstance.  You know, people think that big brother is the, is the United States government.  No, big brother was and still is, spouses spying on each other.  Problem is, is that my bill, the bills got tabled--moneyed interest in this country caused that to be--had to happen.  And now you have a situation now where people have more sophisticated devices.  And that's what's going on right now still.  People are still spying on each other.  GPSs [global positioning system], you can tell, Internet--the whole nine yards.  All of it now, but I was one of the first people to go public on this and to do something about it.  And, and the nom- the, the, the article was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize.  The only reason I didn't win the Pulitzer Prize was because I was an independent reporter.  I wasn't, you know, they, they, tend to give them to newspaper reporters.
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, yeah (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And so I didn't get--but it was nominated and it, it was, it from what I was told it was, it was up, it was up there 'cause it, it did what the Pulitzer Prizes want, i.e., change, cause change to happen and change happened as a result of that, yes.
Story_ID: 637127
Speaker 1: So what was the change that happened?
Speaker 2: Well, like I said the [U.S.] Postal Service changed its regulations and the U.S. postal regulations to prohibit the mailing of this; spy shops who had been selling these products had to close down.  District attorneys, local, in, in, in many jurisdictions started cracking down on these people like that.  And so we got some of it out of the society but the bills--see the problem, here is the problem.  The problem is that in America you have what--under federal law you have what's called one party consent.  That means I can tape our conversation because I'm the party giving consent.  You don't know, you don't even know or give consent.  And so in fourteen states including California, Michigan and Florida, you have what's called two party consent.  And the bills that we put into [U.S.] Congress were to bring the federal--bring that into line with federal laws so that everyone is protected.  So that both parties to the conversation not only have to know that they're being, that they're being taped, they have also to give consent.  And if they don't then its, it's a felony fi- punishable by five years in prison and, and a five thousand dollar fine.  Among other things, I sued RadioShack because they sold her [Brewington's ex-wife, Weida Tucker Richardson] the product, the device.  That case went all the way to the Pennsylvania supreme court [Supreme Court of Pennsylvania] where it was thrown out on a technicality.  But now if you go into a RadioShack store now, you if you buy one of these devices, which I'm, I'm disgusted that they even continued to sell 'em, they still, they have to tell you now, because of my case, not to use it in an illegal fashion.  So we tried to make change.  Again followed back to my mother [Mosetta Smalls], "You make the world a better place boy."
Speaker 1: Well, I mean now it's, there's so much (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --of, of things going on--
Speaker 2: Right
Speaker 1: --you know, and with the Internet and things like that--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --I don't know.  Privacy is a concept.
Speaker 2: Yes it is.  You have the right, all of us as citizens; have the right and expectation of privacy, simple as that.  You lose your privacy; you lose your freedom, simple as that.
Speaker 1: Well, (laughter) I don't even think young people even understand that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Roger that.
Speaker 1: --concept.
Speaker 2: Roger that.
Speaker 1: Huh?
Speaker 2: Roger that.
Speaker 1: They--yeah, they don't understand--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --that concept--
Speaker 2: No ma'am, no ma'am.
Speaker 1: --'cause they're just--
Speaker 2: They're out there.
Speaker 1: --letting it all hang out.
Speaker 2: Yes, ma'am.  They're out there (simultaneous).
Story_ID: 637128
Speaker 1: You know, you, in the '90s [1990s] served, as you were saying, in different PR [public relations] roles with U.S. Immigration [U.S. Customs and Immigration Service] and also for the joint task force [Armed Forces Inaugural Committee], you know, which we talked about.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And then at the National Naval Medical [National Naval Medical Center; Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, Bethesda, Maryland], you know, so you were (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: --were back at, in the [U.S.] Navy.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And, and so what I was wondering is, at this point you're developing more expertise, not such much on the journalism side--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --or news side--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --but on the public affairs--
Speaker 2: Yes, that's true.
Speaker 1: --side.  Um-hm.  So what--are you coming across people like Judy Smith much?  So she was, you know, she had, she--do you know who I'm talking about?
Speaker 2: I think I know that name as a--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --as a agency?
Speaker 1: Well she's been made famous now because 'Scandal' is, is (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, she's the--
Speaker 1: --based on her.
Speaker 2: --prototype for 'Scandal'?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay, cool.  Okay, yeah.
Speaker 1: She's the prototype for 'Scandal.'  But she was also very active--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --you know, in the--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --you know, doing political sort of PR.  You're doing more institutional--
Speaker 2: Institutional, right.
Speaker 1: --public relations.
Speaker 2: And then I went to Amnesty International and I was--did, did public relations there as well.
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: Amnesty International being the foremost human rights organization in the world--Nobel Prize winning.  I worked in the Washington, D.C., headquarters as the communications director.  I was responsible for maintenance of the website and, and, and I, I had people working for me as, as, as agents in the field and, and, and all that, and handling the web- the public affairs issues that Amnesty International is well famous for.
Story_ID: 637129
Speaker 1: What is the most difficult public relation issue that you've had- handled?
Speaker 2: That's a good question.  I mean I didn't think of them as difficult.  I mean they were all challenges when they were given, you know.  You had an iss- you had an issue in front of you, i.e., in human rights of, of, of, of--arena.  The disappearance of people in--oh, I know one, here you go, stun gun--stun belt, stun belt.  You ever heard of a stun belt?  This is a device that they place on prisoners and there are marshals or police officers or whatever marching behind them, and if this individual gets out of control they push a button and send 150,000 volts through their body.  Well, Amnesty International took, took offense to that.  We had Muhammad Ali as our spokesman for that and later his daughter came here, came to Washington, D.C., went to receive an award for his efforts in that.  So, yeah, that was a challenge.  I mean, eradicating stun guns, stun, oh, stun belts.  On the [U.S.] military side, just, just issues related to the environment, issues related to the [U.S.] Navy, the way the Navy operates.  You know I mean, the Navy is a very large organization, I mean, they operate all over the world, I mean you know, and, you know, you have scandals, you have issues.  The Navy, I mean, to be honest, I mean you know, you've, you mentioned to me (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, what were, what were some of the scandals?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, like, like right now they got one going on with--
Speaker 1: No, no, no, when you were there.
Speaker 2: I can't remember specifically.  Just in a general sense, I mean, the job of a public affairs officer, and you pointed out correctly here, I was getting away from being a journalist.  And as a journalist your job is to root out stuff and to find issues (unclear) whereas as a public affairs person your job is to smooth things over and to make things look good and to make the institution look good.  And I became rather adept at that so I can't remember any one specific issue.  Um, um--
Speaker 1: But you--
Speaker 2: Oh, oh, I'll tell you a scandal, the death of Admiral--the chief of naval operations.  There was a scandal related to that.  He had killed himself.
Speaker 1: Like what year was that (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Admiral, Admiral Mike Boorda [Jeremy Michael Boorda], I think that was like 19--in the 1990s something like that.  He had been accused by the media of wearing an, a, a ribbon that he was, didn't deserve and as, as a, as a matter of honor he felt that his honor had been abused and whatever and so he killed himself in the Washington Navy Yard [Washington, D.C.].  And that was one of the big scandals in the Navy at the time.  You know, but you have things where like contractors that over- cost overruns and stuff like that.  I mean, they, they just--the--when you're running a worldwide global organization with huge ships, aircraft carriers, you know I mean, as we speak there are twenty-six submarines plying the oceans of the world, you know I mean, all, and all these issues come to bear.  I mean you know, drug issues, sexual assault issues, that's a big thing in the military right now, dealing with those kinds of issues.  For example, when I was on active duty, a football player, a black football player [Lamar S. Owens Jr.] at the academy [United States Naval Academy, Annapolis, Maryland] was accused of raping a white midshipwoman.  He claimed it was consensual; however, the court found otherwise and I, I attended his court martial and it was very sad sitting there watching his mother [Kimberly Owens] and father [Lamar S. Owens, Sr.], the look on their face.  He had been the joy of their life, the star of their town and here he was being stripped of everything, and they had to pay back three years of education at the Naval Academy.  You know, so you--so my job was to deal with the media, you know, in, in regards to making an explanation for incidents that happen in the Navy, being a spokesperson, the Washington Navy Yard for example and then later on I became spokesperson for my website--not my website, but the Navy's official quality of life website called Lifelines.  That was a joy because I--it was all positive.  I mean I would, and I had beaucoup media coverage on that.  I mean from Wired magazine to all the, the, the, the ma- ma- major newspapers.  I put out releases on a regular basis.  It was beautiful.  I mean, we would, we were showing that the quality of service is affected by the quality of life of the individual and the family--and most importantly, the family.  Man can't get, or woman, can't get into a $25 million aircraft if he's worried about his, his family being well taken care of, and that's what we did.  We provided them with information.  You name it, across the board of everything.  I'll give you an example.  For example, if they want to go on vacation there was a link there to--we had two thousand links in, on the website.  There was a link to the, the park service where you could find out where everything is.  Disney World [Walt Disney World Resort, Orlando, Florida], everything and it was all there.  Medical information, life information, financial information, you name it; we gave it to these families and they loved us.  We were the second most trafficked website in the United States Navy.  It was wonderful.
Story_ID: 637130
Speaker 1: And you did that until what year?
Speaker 2: 'Til approximately 1996, which is when I retired from the [U.S.] Navy, from broadcasting, from everything.
Speaker 1: And so what have you been doing since that time?
Speaker 2: Well, there are times that I've been feeling that I've been more b-busier (laughter) since I've retired than when I worked.  I'm involved in a number of things.  For example, I'm on the executive board of the national association of black veterans [National Association for Black Veterans], Nevada chapter.  We insure that, not only just black veterans, but veterans of all ilk and colors, races, get the, the benefits that are due them because of their service.  You know, this is--unfortunately I, I'm a, I'm in favor of the draft.  This is not Israel.  Everybody doesn't have to serve in the [U.S.] military here.  So, 1 percent of the population protects the other 99 percent.  So I'm, we're all about, "You did that, you stepped, stepped up young man, young woman, here're the benefits that you're gonna get, that you're entitled to, and here we're gonna make sure you get 'em."  I'm involved with that.  I'm involved also with the Knights of Peter Claver.  This is a--I don't know if you ever heard of them.  This is the, well like with the Masons, years ago blacks couldn't join the Knights of Columbus, so in, in circa 1905 or whatever the Knights of Peter Claver were formed in New Orleans [Louisiana].
Speaker 1: How do you pronounce the Peter Clay?
Speaker 2: Claver, C-L-A-V-E-R.
Speaker 1: So it's Peter?
Speaker 2: Peter, yes, ma'am, P-E-T-E-R, Claver.  This is named after a saint, Spanish nobleman [Saint Peter Claver] who is responsible for bringing Christianity to hundreds of thousands of slaves during that Middle Passage area, era.  And we in Las Vegas [Nevada] area, we provide people with food, shelter if we can, you name it.  We help work in the community, work in the church and provide, and its, its again wonderful.  I enjoy it.  You know, I, I, and, and so I'm busy.  I mean, I'm, I rarely have an off day.  I mean, I'm down, doing something all the time, including this.  And so God has again, God has blessed me.  I mean it's like, it's like it all goes back, and I'm sorry if I get repetitious, but it goes back to my mama [Mosetta Smalls].
Story_ID: 637131
Speaker 1: So what are your thoughts about--'cause you know, I was thinking about the community you grew up in Harlem [New York, New York] and you were even saying, you know, that a lot of, there was a lot of gun violence (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --there and, you know, and now there's a lot of gun, but his has been a year of--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --a lot of gun--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --violence--
Speaker 2: It's sad.
Speaker 1: --and so I wanted to ask you what your hopes and concerns are for the black community?
Speaker 2: That's a good point.  I--since I'm sixty-seven years old, I've been able to watch the Civil Rights Movement go from here to stopping to going down.  My hopes and aspiration are that we can--'cause we got lost along the way.  I don't know if it was a lack of leadership or leadership took us in the wrong direction, but we were going this way (gesture) to improve ourselves as a people and as a race and then suddenly it stopped.  Now we're on the total decline.  I look at young men and young women today and I hurt.  They have opportunities that other people fought for that their grandmothers would have killed for yet they blow them away.  I mean, the, the, the, the, the, the high school dropout rate across, in, in, in black American is high.  We know about the incarceration rate.  We know about that.  I mean, I wonder where we're going.  You know, because if, if we don't hurry up and find a place we're going to become as Richard Pryor use to say, "Null and void."  It's gone happen to us.  You know, and, and it bothers me.  I mean it worries me.  I, I try where I can.  I see young people.  Some young people you can talk to, a lot of 'em you can't.  They don't want to hear what you have to say.  Their hat is on backwards first of all, which is, the sun visor supposed to be here (gesture) to keep the sun out their eyes; it's back here or over here.  You know, you can't, you can't talk to 'em.  You know, and, and I worry about as a race where we're going and what's gone happen to us.  And, and I, I try in my small way, you know, to talk to people here, you know man, go use this, take this avenue.  This is America. You can do what you want to do.  Nobody's--the only place--racism still abounds but by and large the only person who can stop you from doing what you want to do is you.  So take advantage of it.  Go to school.  Get edu- you got Pell Grant; you got stuff we didn't have when we were coming up.  You got this, you got that, you got this, this program that program.  Take it.  Go to school, get an education.  Don't aspire to being here in, in Las Vegas [Nevada] a maid.  Don't aspire to being a butler.  You know, aspire to better.  Be an entrepreneur.  You've got examples out here now and it, it, it, it, it does, it troubles me.  It, it really, really does because, you know, everybody else is moving on but us.  Hispanics are moving up.  They're now the number one minority in America.  They're taking over all the jobs that black folk used to have, you know?  So we're, we're, we're in trouble.
Story_ID: 637132
Speaker 1: We ask legacy question- questions, but I want to ask you another question I haven't asked many people and that is:  What is the legacy of your generation?
Speaker 2: We brought change (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Because, you're a part of the Great Society.
Speaker 2: Yes ma'am.  We brought change to this society.  We stopped segregation.  We stopped unequal treatment.  We made, we made an--we codified, made into law equal rights, the right to ride on a bus, the right to eat where you want, the right to live where you want.  We stood out in front of fire hoses and dogs to give these young people today, you know?  And, and the other day I was in, in, in, in, in a store and I heard the N word saying over and over again and I'm turning around looking and its two young black men.  And I'm like, "Excuse me young men, you ain't that."  "You getting in my--you disrespecting me, you getting in my conver--."  I say, "Well, you're saying it loud enough that I can hear it, okay?  Do you know what that word conjures up?  Do you know what that means?  Whether you put an A on it instead of E-R that don't change the connotation of it.  You're not that," you know?  And, and, and, and our generation who fought for all these rights--and I told them, I said, "My generation stood out in front of fire hoses and dogs so you can stand here, so you can walk in the store, in the front door and don't have to walk where there's a colored entrance, where there is this and that, you know?  Take advantage of it, go to school, learn something, be somebody," you know?  It, it, it, it, it troubles me, it troubles me.
Story_ID: 637133
Speaker 1: So what do you want your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: Mine?  I'm just a guy.  I'm just a guy who is out here, who has been out here and is out here until I close my eyes, who's trying to do the best I can to be a good man, to be a good father and I was a father.  I spent hundreds of thousands of dollars to be a father in America because in America everything I did with my son [Carter Brewington] for fifteen years was by court order, even to talk to him because that's the nature of it.  Mama [Brewington's ex-wife, Weida Tucker Richardson] got the child, mama will raise the child, dad [HistoryMaker Rudolph Brewington] give me the money.  And I just, I'm a guy who's influenced by my mother [Mosetta Smalls] to do the best I can to help the world, make the world a better place.  And that's all I tried to do all my life.  And until I close my eyes that's exactly what I'm going to do, nothing more, nothing less.  If I can, if I, I mean if I see people on the street that need money, I know all of them aren't, I mean, people are panhandling.  I know some of 'em are making a business, hey here, but I can't do that.  I can't judge that.  I give it as a Christian, I give it in good faith.  "Here you take that and what you do with it is your business," and, and, and, and, and be in people's lives and be a help and not a hindrance in people's lives.  That's all I can be: just a guy, just a guy.  That's all I can tell you.
Story_ID: 637134
Speaker 1: With respect to what is quintessentially African American to me is that we are a race of people who were brought here against our will.  As Malcom X said, "Plymouth we--Plymouth Rock landed on us.  We didn't land on Plymouth Rock."  I have a picture in my house and I look at it every day of a slave ship.  We were packed in like sardines and brought here against our will.  They knew X amount of them would die in Middle Passage but they factored that all in.  And we came here; we were used to build this country.  One of my college classes I had a--I wrote a paper about the economics of slavery.  It's estimated that African American labor produced seven quadrillion, I didn't say million or billion or trillion, I said quadrillion dollars.  We made this country.  This country was built on our backs.  Confederates even, that's why they even aspired to go and separate from the Union.  Because cotton in the South was what Saudi, what oil is in Saudi Arabia.  We did that.  We ma- we made inventions that nobody--were taken away from us and stolen and all that and yet in spite of all that we're still here.  We overcame, you know.  Our best days should be ahead of us.  Our legacy is not to be incarcerated, that more of us go to jail than go to college.  Our legacy is not that we lead in all the bad things, the negative things, in the world.  Our legacy is to take what our ancestors did, their sacrifice build on it and move on and progress and become wonderful people.  That's our legacy in my opinion.
