Speaker 1: Okay, and, and do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: From childhood, that's what comes on my mind, that was, was one of Beatitutes, blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.  That was something that stayed with me in, in, from childhood.  As I got older, I got a lot of sayings.
Story_ID: 72227
Speaker 1: Yeah, let's talk about your beginnings, and could you give us the names of your parents and their birth dates and places of birth?
Speaker 2: Okay, my father was named, name's Harold Battiste, Harold Battiste, Sr.  He was born in a place called Vacherie, Louisiana, in 1900.
Speaker 1: Can you spell that for us?
Speaker 2: No (laughter).
Speaker 1: Can, can you pronounce it again?
Speaker 2: Vacherie, it's V-A-C-H-R-E-Y [V-A-C-H-E-R-I-E].  It's one of those French kind of things.  I don't know--
Speaker 1: Vacherie, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, and when was he born again?
Speaker 2: Nineteen hundred [1900].
Speaker 1: Nineteen hundred [1900], okay.  And your mother?

Speaker 1: Okay, now can you spell her last name, her--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --maiden name?
Speaker 2: Booker, B-O-O-K-E-R.
Speaker 1: Okay, and did you have--did you receive any stories from them or from your grandparents about your, your ancestors and, and what they were doing?  And how far can you go back in your family tree?
Speaker 2: I, I can only--I've done a lot of trying to, trying to find myself, so I can only go back as far as my grand and my, my maternal grandparents.  And with my father on my paternal side, I, I, I've gone out to Vacherie trying to find, but I can't find anything about them.  I know his father's name.  My grand--paternal grandfather's name was Eugene.  And my paternal grandmother's name, her last name was Barnes, but that's all I know.
Speaker 1: Now, what about on your mother's side?
Speaker 2: My mother's side, my, my, my, my pa--my mother's mother's name was Mary, Mary Booker.  Her husband was named Wilbert Booker.  And I did know--get to know 'em 'cause we lived with them when I was a little boy, all of us lived in the same house, myself and my mother and father and my grandmother and my grandfather.
Story_ID: 72228
Speaker 1: (Unclear) what did your grandparents do for a living?
Speaker 2: My, my grandfather [Wilbert Booker] had a wood yard.  We had a, I call him now, I say he would have been a neighborhood energy expert.  I mean he sold wood, coal, and ice.  He had a wagon and a horse, and I used to go with him, you know, out on the route.  And, and then we had wood stacked in the yard where people could come and buy nickel wood, get 10 sticks of wood for nickel for their stoves or whatever.  And my grandmother [Mary Booker] was a, was a cook.  She, she had a family of fer--up in the St. Charles area in the Garden District they called it.  But she cooked for some wealthy white people, you know, that was what she did.  When my grandfather died she took over the wood yard, and she started running that.
Story_ID: 72229
Speaker 1: Now what, what did your father do for a living?
Speaker 2: My father [Harold Battiste, Sr.] was a tailor.  My father had a tailor and a cleaning shop on Rampart Street through in the--343 South Rampart, which was in the heart of the--well, I would I call the district where jazz got started, that was right down the block was where the (unclear) saloon was, was where Louis Armstrong got started.  He used to deliver stuff as a little boy, Buddy Bolden [Charles "Buddy" Bolden] and all those guys.  I didn't know that then.  I used to go down to the shop and help alter pants and stuff like that for my daddy.  His, his shop was called Eagle Tailor Shop.
Speaker 1: Eagle?
Speaker 2: Eagle, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, what kind of person was your father?
Speaker 2: Well, the, the family always called him Ralph Bunche, that's what they called him, because he was, he was, he was a quiet and very, you know, seemingly very just.  He could cease and keep everybody--when everybody had problems in the family they'd come to him, come to him.
Speaker 1: Oh, this is a reference to the United Nations or--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --organizing of Ralph Bunche?
Speaker 2: Yeah, right, well, yeah, Ralph Bunche, you know 'cause--
Speaker 1: Wrote the charter for the UN [United Nations].
Speaker 2: Yeah, right, you know, he was the Ralph Bunche, you know.  And, but he was a very--all I re--I mean my childhood memories him, and I'm realizing it now, 'cause I see those characteris-'cause he's a workaholic, I mean he always was working at the shop, even during the holidays.  Well, the kind of work he did, people needed him during the holidays more, getting, buying clothes, and he had to alter 'em.  But I can only remember one time going to a baseball game or something with him and, and--but most of the time he was working, just you know he's going down to the shop or either he'd bring clothes home, work on 'em and stuff like that.  And it was, you know--it, it never did affect me negatively because that's what I thought fathers did (laughter), you know, you know.  And the thing that I remember most, I mean now in this part of my life, because--and I remember I never heard any, any stuff that they talk about now, negative stuff.  I never heard--I never even heard him call my mother [Pearl Battiste] anything but sweetheart, and the same with her with him.  I never heard them call each other by name.  They just called each other sweetheart.  So it was, it was that kind of childhood thing.  I now realized that I was really blessed to live in a household like that.  And we would stay with my grandmother and grandfather, 'cause they were in the house too.  It was the same kind of situation.
Story_ID: 72230
Speaker 1: So.
Speaker 2: Now, what, what, what about your mother [Pearl Battiste]--
Speaker 1: My mother?
Speaker 2: --about her, what, what kind of a person she was and what did she do?
Speaker 1: She was very, very, very, very quiet and honest, and she was--my impression, well, I guess she was my mother, so--[cough]--but she was really dedicated to being a wife and mother; that was what she did.  She had been a schoolteacher.  She finished at the, what used to be the New Orleans University they called it.  It was a normal school that trained--I don't know if it was just African-American women, but how to teach school.  So she finished from UNO [University of New Orleans] in 1923--no, it was NOU then, New Orleans University in 1923.  And when she got married, then as was appropriate then, I guess that the woman, you know, put aside her career and became a household engineer and raised her family and take care of, you know, take care of the home front.  So, not until I was out of high school going to college then she started doing substitute work again as a teacher.
Story_ID: 72231
Speaker 1: Okay, now, now how many brothers and sisters did you have, and where do you fall in that, in that?
Speaker 2: Well, I was, I was the only child that, that, you know, by birth.  But they had adopted a cousin of mine who--well, my, my father's  [Harold Battiste, Sr.] sister--one of my father's sisters died young, and she left four or five children.  And so--this was before I was born--they, they went and--like families used to do then, if nobody--we'd take these children.  So they took the youngest boy, just in case I would have turned out to be a girl (laughter), if they wanted to have a boy.  So, so Albert was--they adopted.  He came up as my brother.  I, I never knew him as anything other than my brother.  And not until he had to go to the Army did the lady say well, that's not your real name; Battiste is not your name.  You gotta--they found out his, you know, so he had to start using that name.  But he's my brother.  He still calls me every morning right now.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, so how, how, how--
Speaker 2: That was a--
Speaker 1: --how much older is he than you?
Speaker 2: Just three or four years.
Story_ID: 72232
Speaker 1: Now I want you to, you know, think back and let us know about, something about the neighborhood you grew up in, and what were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up in that neighborhood?
Speaker 2: It was a neighborhood right in what they call now Central City, like they call everything black in the whole country, Central City, around Second and Saratoga.  It was a--[clearing throat]--it was a very neat neighborhood to me.  In my perception, it was very neat.  We had a lot of young children and a lot of, you know, lot of--by comparison now, I mean it was just, it was a real wonderful neighborhood.  There was never any problems, and then we, we had fun, you know.  As a child, we would go out on Halloween and put on put on our sheets and do--just everything was really, really good in that neighborhood.  And of course my parents, because my fa--my grandfather [Wilbert Booker] had the wood yard, we sort of had--you know, we sort of like were central point, you know, you know, 'cause everybody came by their to get some wood, or either my grandpa was delivering stuff to 'em.  Yeah, we had--I had a lot of fun those first ten years of my life we lived there.
Story_ID: 72233
Speaker 1: Okay, what, what, what were some of your favorite activities as a little boy?
Speaker 2: Well, it was I guess myself and some of the neighbors, some of the boys, little kids from next door, we used to like to go out and do all the little things; like, we used to play marbles, play marbles, and we'd, we'd also, as a creative thing, we would build little dirt roads and stuff outside, you know, you know, like people would do at the beach.  We didn't have a beach, you know, like sand building things.  We'd build 'em, you know, when if--particularly if it rained and got muddy, then we could build things on--yeah.
Speaker 1: So you made use of the dirt that was out there (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yeah, you made use of the dirt, and we'd build, build the roads and try to make little things that look like mountains and stuff.
Speaker 1: Did you--
Speaker 2: And we had cars and little toy things--(unclear).
Story_ID: 72234
Speaker 1: Was there a lot of music in the neighborhood when you, when you grew up?
Speaker 2: Not a lot of music.  A lot of music would pass there, you know, in the form of parades, you know, little private club.  Everybody had an excuse.  You know, if somebody died or they were having an anniversary for something like that they'd have a parade.  And that was one of the major (unclear).  You'd be sitting at the dinner table, and you'd hear a drum coming from way down.  And you'd jump up from the table and go find the drumbeat.  Just like people go looking for fire when they see smoke, well, when you'd hear drumbeats, that's when you--everybody stops and go--where is it coming from?  Let's go get it, yeah.
Speaker 1: You might not realize this, but, I mean being raised in New Orleans [Louisiana], but people in other cities don't, don't hear this kind of thing.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, I just know that, yeah (laughter).
Speaker 1: We don't have parades coming down a lot, you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: So when I ask you if there's a lot of music, I guess you don't have anything to compare it to.
Speaker 2: Yeah, but, well, I guess it was a lot, but it was--'cause it was always--almost every weekend somebody was doing something, you know, some club or something.  So there was a lot of, lot of that.
Story_ID: 72235
Speaker 1: Now when you were little, did you admire musicians or did you, did you have any idea that you wanted to be a musician?
Speaker 2: No, I didn't, I didn't.  I, I really didn't have an idea that, that was something you could be.  I mean I knew some.  There was a guy named Robesha (ph.) used to come by the house, and he would play on the piano or something like that.  And then the most music I knew of was at church, you know, and I got in the choir when I was very young.  And I got a couple of solos so everybody said I could sing, you know.  And, and of course there was a piano in the house.  And I used to listen to the radio a lot when I was five or six years old.  And I remember always getting a couple of forks and beating on the furniture and try to play with the radio, play along with the radio, beating--I had little fork marks all over my mama's [Pearl Battiste] cedar chest and stuff like that.  And then when I got to be about seven or eight, I started trying to pick things out on the piano.  I just started--you know, I'd hear something on the radio, and I--like in--there was a song called "Penny Serenade."  I'll never forget--[singing] see, see, see, you can hear for a penny.  And I started learning how to pick that on a piano.  And when, when I got it, you know, I thought everybody would just be so happy and excited 'cause I was excited I could do it, but my mother didn't like that too well.
Speaker 1: She, she didn't like the, the idea that--she didn't like the thought--
Speaker 2: Well, she, she liked--she--well, she was thinking.  See, she, she would've had--I didn't know it then, but she had thoughts of me being a doctor or something.  And her fear was that I would like it too much, and I would be a musician.  You know, so she, she just didn't, you know.  So, when I was about ten years old, we were gonna move into the housing project, that was the first project back in 1941.  And she told me that they didn't allow people to have pianos in the project, so we had to leave the piano.  But that was her way of trying to, trying to steer me away from getting too attached to music.
Story_ID: 72236
Speaker 1: Now, so, you think like musicians are kind of stigmatized, you know?
Speaker 2: Kind of?
Speaker 1: Well--
Speaker 2: Yeah, they were loved, but still, you know.  And then it's, it, it's almost still that way.  They were loved, but people who wanted to do better, they wanted their children to do something.  You know, like it was always--yeah, it's fine to be a musician, but what you gon' do?  You know, the heart of silver--(unclear)--that was (unclear)--you would say yeah, now you, you, you, you gonna play this music and stuff, but what you gonna do for a living?  So music was not really seen in the black community as a real way to make a living.  You know and most of the older musicians did have other jobs that they did, you know, and it was either a cigar maker or the--they did something to make a living.  And the music was just like this is what I do 'cause I love it, and if I make a little money, good.  But you know, that's not something that you said, this is what I'm going to be from the standpoint of that.  And I, I, I would even imagine that with my mother's [Pearl Battiste] having, you know, having went to school and she was a schoolteacher, her--I--her hopes were that I would, you know, go to school, graduate, and do something decent like, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 72237
Speaker 1: You mentioned decent, and I just wondered if it was because the musicians who made money had to play in places where they sold--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --alcohol and I mean--
Speaker 2: Well, yeah.
Speaker 1: --(unclear)--homes and stuff like that.  Well, is that the reason why pe--people who wanted to do something respectable like look down on being a musician because the venues were--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --for music were--
Speaker 2: The atmosphere.  Well, see, the reputation that music, particularly jazz, had of being barrelhouse music or whorehouse music, even worse--and the, the way the historians have always referred to the music was referring to that scene as though that's what it was for.  And that's one of the re--one of I think the reason it's taken so long for general, general population in America to accept jazz, and certainly particularly in the black community to accept the, the, the artistic qualities of the music that we created, because it does not, it does not necessarily follow in the pattern of European music, that is a so-called scholarly function that you go to school and you study and so forth.  The cats that we all admire didn't do that.  And, and so we don't, we don't seem to recognize that the value of it because it sort of comes from out of that, from the streets.  It doesn't come from above; it comes from the streets.  And so my parents, you know, my mother [Pearl Battiste] and fa--my father [Harold Battiste, Sr.] wasn't, 'cause he--his shop was out on Rampart Street, he had a different view of the, of the, of the (unclear)--the society that was so-called street society.
Story_ID: 72238
Speaker 1: So about two or three years later, after we were in the project, he [Harold Battiste, Sr.] got me a clarinet from a pawnshop (unclear).  And, and so I started playing, playing clarinet in the school band.
Speaker 2: How old were you then about?
Speaker 1: Oh--
Speaker 2: Eleven, like that?
Speaker 1: See--I finished high school at 15 so, no, it was about--yeah, about, I was twelve, twelve, yeah, about twelve, you know.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I got the clarinet my last year of being in, in the grammar school.
Speaker 2: Did you have an instructor, somebody teach you how to play or did you just--
Speaker 1: Yeah, I had a band.  You know, I got this band, school band.  I mean I didn't have a private instructor or nothing like that, just got in the school band and he taught everybody how to do everything.  You know, he'd just give you a little book to show you where, where to put your fingers and so forth and you're on your own now.
Story_ID: 72239
Speaker 1: I wanna backtrack a little bit and go back to grade school.  What grade school did you go to?
Speaker 2: It was a school called F. P. Ricard School.  It had been previously called Booker T. Washington, but then they built a high school and named that Booker T. Washington, so the grammar school I was going to changed that name to F. P. Ricard.
Speaker 1: Now who was F. P. Ricard?
Speaker 2: I don't know who he was, Fortunates (ph.) P. Ricard.  I never knew who he was.
Speaker 1: What, what's his full name again?
Speaker 2: Fortunanes P. Ricard.
Speaker 1: That's a name.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, I never did get to know who he was.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: 'Cause--that was--and I'm just thinking about a lot of, a lot of the names of things we didn't learn, you know, we never--I mean, know who Booker T. Washington was, but a lot of other names we just didn't know it.  It might have been a white guy, you know, 'cause a lot of our schools were like all those McDonnell schools--I don't know if they have them anywhere else other than here, but they had a lot of schools named McDonnell, named after some philanthropist who dedicated money to--yeah.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA MALE VOICE):  (Unclear)--spell Ricard?
Speaker 2: Oh--
Speaker 1: It's, it's, it's, it's spelled like Richard, R-I-C-A-R-D, Ric--yeah, R-I-C-A-R-D.
Speaker 2: C-A-R-D?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --Ricard, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So, what did you like to do in school?  I mean what was your--what, what, what, what were your favorite subjects, and did you have a lot of friends in school?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: What--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Well, particular--
Speaker 2: --like?
Speaker 1: When I--grade school?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Well, I mean I was--like I showed you, I have a picture.  You know, my, my, my parents [Harold and Pearl Battiste] were very into what, whatever activities were, so when I ran for king that was a highlight of my grammar school career, you know, and won, won to be the Mardi Gras king.  And my people made up a nice costume like a king.  And we had a parade, and I got to drink some 7-Up in a glass and throw the glass out on the sidewalk, you know.  And then when we got back to school, the queen, I had to dance with the queen, you know (unclear).  But she was taller than me (laughter), and, and I refused to dance with her.  She was too tall.
Speaker 2: So you were pretty popular in grade school?
Speaker 1: I guess, yeah, I guess so.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right.
Story_ID: 72240
Speaker 1: Can you remember any particular teachers that stood out in grade school that--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, there's no question, there's a, a lady named--she was Ms. Glen then.  Her name is Ms. Williams.  She may still be alive.  She's about in her 90s somewhere now, in fact.  She may still be alive.  Yeah, Ms. Ms. Ms. Glen was definitely my favorite teacher.
Speaker 1: And why?
Speaker 2: Because I was her favorite student, (laughter) I guess that's why.  You know, she, she really, you know, she liked me.  And she was my third grade teacher.  And you know, she really sort of looked, looked after me in all my life when I was--when I went out to Los Angeles [California], she had moved out there.  And after she got married and became Mrs. Williams, she always kept track of me.  And then--even since I've back in New Orleans [Louisiana], you know, I've seen her several times.
Story_ID: 72241
Speaker 1: All right, well, what, what about high school?  Now what high school did you attend?
Speaker 2: Gilbert Academy [New Orleans, Louisiana].  That was a--Gilbert Academy was--actually, the building was up on St. Charles Avenue near Jefferson, which was very odd because that's a completely white neighborhood, and to have a black school up there, it--I don't know exactly what the history is, but I know it used to be the school that my mother [Pearl Battiste] have gone to as New Orleans University back in the days.  I don't know--it was people who founded that school particularly for, for black people.  And when New Orleans University and another normal university, they, they merged to become Dillard University.  And, and then, so it was changed to be a high school, and that was Gilbert Academy.  It was a private school pro--Methodist school I think, and my parents--my mother particularly wanted to send me there.  I didn't wanna go there.
Speaker 1: 'Cause if you had gone to public school, you'd have gone to Booker T. Washington [High School, New Orleans, Louisiana].
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's, that's where I wanted to go.  I mean 'cause all of my boys from the neighborhood--by that time, we're living in the project and all my friends--and Booker T. Washington was new; it was just, it had just been built.  And so I really wanted to go there, but my mother and sisters, they liked to go up to Gilbert Academy.  And I'm really, I mean I really wish--you know, I didn't know how wise my mother was.  But because--but in retrospect, I mean everything that she wanted me to do was the right thing to do.  Some of 'em I didn't do and I paid for it.  For the things that way I did it, I got rewarded for it.
Story_ID: 72242
Speaker 1: Okay, so what was Gilbert Academy [New Orleans, Louisiana] like?
Speaker 2: Well, it was--well, academically, I understand I don't--I didn't have anything 'cause I didn't go anywhere else, but I--it was, it was superior.  We had wonderful teachers.  I mean the things that I learned there, even though I was very immature when I went there, they stuck with me.  Like for instance, I still--the, the, the, the science teacher, who was a bas--basketball coach--I don't know which one he really was, but he did both of those things.  I'll never for that during the science course, at one point he brought us to a, a convergence so that the theory of evolution, as opposed to the theory of creation, and that was the first time I had ever been con--you know, put those two things together.  But he left it to us.  He said, now you all have to--I can take you that far, but you gotta make up your own mind which one you accept.  And that was to me a tremendous, you know--he didn't just teach us; he just, he led us to information and left, left, left it open for us to go figure out which one we really wanted.  And that, that, that never left me, and it made me--all my life I've still have those two concepts dealing with each other.  There were other things in you know, in that.  And, and our principal was a woman way ahead of her time, named Ms. Bowen.  She was just a miraculous woman, man.  For that time, man, the things that she demanded for her students and the, the, the decor and the comportment that we have to ha--you know--
Story_ID: 72243
Speaker 1: So Mrs. Bowen--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --the principal and--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --spell her name for us.
Speaker 2: B-O-W-E-N, that's Margaret Davis Bowen.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now and this school was a Methodist school--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --run by one of the black Methodist denominations.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, I guess so.  I don't know who ran it, but I know it was--yeah.  In fact, the principal's, her husband was a Methodist minister, 'cause I went to the church under him at fir--
Speaker 1: What was the name of that church?
Speaker 2: First Street Methodist, and I think it was an AME, First Street AME, I think that's what it was--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --at that time.
Story_ID: 72244
Speaker 1: What, what kind of activities did you engage in in high school [Gilbert Academy, New Orleans, Louisiana] other than music?  You, you, you played music, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I mean I was--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --in the band.  That was my (unclear)--
Speaker 1: You--were you in a marching band too?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's--well, that was a main--major band was a--well, I shouldn't say that.  The marching band was the, the attraction that most kids got in the band for. But we also had a, a concert band, so that after football season, we went into, to prepare music to do a concert.  And that was very, you know, that was, that was very significant in, in my early musical development because it really familiarized me with the, the broad spectrum, particularly of European music.  But in the meantime, I was also trying to impress my band director.  And I wasn't the best clarinetist in the band 'cause they had two other guys who was--they would play first clarinet.  I was playing second clarinet on the row with the girls (laughter).  But in order to impress him, I, I, I, I listened to a record.  There was a record out then by a blues singer named Cleanhead Vinson, Eddie Cleanhead Vinson.  And I liked it very much, so I said I'mma see if I can write down everything that I hear on this record, there's "Old Maid Boogie" and on the side was called "Kidney Stew."  And I wrote it all out.  I just wrote all of the notes that I could hear out and brought it to school.  And he had some guys to play it, and it sounded just like the record.  So he got excited and he, he said, boy, you could be an arranger.  Well, I didn't, I didn't even know what an arranger was.  So he sent me downtown to the music store, World Lines Music, to buy a Glen Miller book on arranging.  And so I got the book, and the book completely confused me.  I mean when I started trying to read that stuff, you know what I mean, I said I got confused completely, so I forgot about the book and went back to what I was doing, just listening to it and writing out stuff like that.  But that was the beginning of me seeing that writing was something that I really liked to do, you know, mainly, as I said, mainly because I could do that better than some other guys.  They hadn't thought about doing that, 'cause I, I wasn't that great a player.
Speaker 1: But that is a, quite a talent.  You, you can actually listen to (unclear) and write the notes down.
Speaker 2: That's what--yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, not everybody--
Speaker 2: That's what--
Speaker 1: --can do that, I know that.
Speaker 2: No, yeah, well, yeah.  I could--I, I, I did that.  So I, I sort of got to be the designator when we were young.  All of us were young, other jazz cats that were trying to learn how to play bee-bop and all that stuff.  I sort of got to be the designator, writer, or transcriber.  You know, we'd get some new Charlie Parker records and stuff like that, and they knew I could figure out (laughter) the music, music for it.
Speaker 1: You'd listen to the record and then write notes down and give them the note players (laughter).  That's, that's something.
Story_ID: 72245
Speaker 1: Well, well, what else did you do in, in, in high school [Gilbert Academy, New Orleans, Louisiana]?  I mean did you like other subjects and--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, yeah--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: I always did, I always did like science things.  I always--you know, I guess that was latent in my mind that mom [Pearl Battiste] wanted me to be a doctor.  I always did like biology and, and stuff like that, so I did pretty good in those.  Even when I got in college I really still--you know, I took botany when I got in college and I then.
Speaker 1: So you had a pretty good idea you were going to college when you were in high school?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah, I mean I knew I was going, 'cause you know, you my mother and father were focused on that, that, that I would, you know, go to school.  And I was real young, and there wasn't much I could do 'cause when I--I was fifteen when I finished high school, so there wasn't much else.  I couldn't go to the service or nothing like that, wasn't no adjustment (unclear) to go, go straight to college.  And there, again, I didn't necessarily wanna go to Dillard [Dillard University, New Orleans, Louisiana].  I wanted to go to Southern [Southern University and Agricultural and Mechanical College, Baton Rouge, Louisiana] out there.  You know, I wanted to go out of town, and all my buddies was gonna go to Southern.  But, no, she insisted that I go to Dillard.  And there, again, she was right (unclear), yeah.
Story_ID: 72246
Speaker 1: So what hap--what was Dillard [Dillard University, New Orleans, Louisiana] like?
Speaker 2: Well, Dillard was an adventure for me 'cause here I was 15 years old when I was there, and everybody was older than that.  And most of the guys coming out of the service around that time--G.I. Bill--so there was a lot of older guys coming in the school.  So I was--I felt like a real teenager.  Well, I was.  I felt like a kid though.  And I'll, I'll never forget when I was a freshman and I was in--I failed in one of my music courses, Music Appreciation, which was boring, you know, 'cause you had to sit up there and listen to a lot of symphonic music.  But it was right after lunch period.  And me, still being a kid, during lunch I'd be playing basketball.  I'd go out there and play basketball and get wore out, then come back into Music Appreciation class and go to sleep, so.  But Dillard--and I remember that's when I first started smoking, you know, just to be on the campus.  You know, me and a buddy of mine who had went to Gilbert [Gilbert Academy, New Orleans, Louisiana] said we, we men, now we can smoke.  So we put in and bought a pack of Pall Mall cigarettes and smoked on the campus, yeah.  But mostly, you know, I mean I guess the--my, my, my musical development and my, my consciousness then of playing jazz became more apparent during that time because the school had some sort of dislike for the students playing jazz or playing that kind of music.  They looked down on it, and I was determined to, to do it.  And fortunately, I had a instrumental music teacher who--
Story_ID: 72247
Speaker 1: Okay, what about your instrumental music teacher?
Speaker 2: Oh yes, we--at Dillard [Dillard University, New Orleans, Louisiana] we had a--and fortunately, just about the time I went there, there's a guy named O--Melville C. Bryant, who, who was hired.  He had been a, he had been in the service, and I think he was a warrant officer, warrant officer in the service, and he had been dealing with music in there.  And so his outlook on the music program at Dillard sort of allowed for--well, it allowed us to do a little jazz.  Well, I was the only cat there that was really, you know, involved in, in trying to play jazz.  And there were other guys who wanted to do it, and then--and so I became sort of like the catalyst to sort of get jazz on the campus.  Although it wasn't officially in the curriculum, I could do that as an outside project.  And so my whole tenure at Dillard became doing that, getting jazz played on the campus and getting the opportunity myself then to write some things and so forth and to have a little jazz--a little dance band.  And I guess one of the most significant things that happened was that I had two young guys who were in high school when I first went to Dillard, one was named Roger Dickerson, and the other one name was Ellis Marsalis [Ellis Marsalis, Jr.,HM].  He was--and they had heard about me.  And so Ellis, on his way to school in high school, he told me he used to cut class and come hang out with me at Dillard, 'cause he wanted to be around somebody that could, you know, show him some stuff about playing piano.  And then so when he finished--when both of them finished, they came to Dillard.  And I was a senior at that point, and they were freshman, so they really added a lot to, to the idea of having jazz on the campus.  The thing that I guess that I guess stayed with me, the fact was that jazz, which was I considered music that, you know, from our community by the, the--like my mother [Pearl Battiste] I guess.  Our people still sort of held the music back from coming into, into, into the higher soak--circles.  We were still, you know, referring European music.  So that stayed with me a long, a long time, so it's been sort of, sort of a lifelong thing with me, trying to make--elevate the perception of jazz music and the people who play it.
Story_ID: 72248
Speaker 1: So if, if you were like a, a, a middle class black person in those days, you would, you would tend to shun jazz or try to--
Speaker 2: Well, not--it's not about liking it, but it's where you think it may belong.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know, it's, it's about sort of keeping it in its place.
Speaker 1: So they might like it, but only--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: But only--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous)--or something--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --not, not in school.
Speaker 2: Not and certainly not, not take it to the level of the, the way you think of European music.  You think of that as something you dress up to go to concerts for.  But jazz is, has a--and that's just a general perception.  Even the musicians themselves have that perception that this music was not to be taken seriously.  The language has reflected that over the years where jazz musicians were considered to be faking or they was--they would--by inference be considered illegitimate, because cats would say, "well, is he a legit player," meaning does he play European-style music, 'cause he plays symphonic music or is he schooled, he would be legitimate, which infers that the cats who gon' do that, they are illegitimate.  Or when a cat's playing up there and he doesn't have music before him, they would say well, he's faking.  And so the musician accepted that.  That's why I said well, yeah, I can fake, which implies that unless you are reading music, you're faking it, and that's not a good term to, to make people have a perception of the complexity of doing what we do.  And so that's what's been, you know, I just, a longtime struggle of mine is to, is to try to get the perception of what we do elevated to in the people's minds that hey, this is something is very special.  Many of the Eur--Europe--I met Igor Stravinsky back--I done forgot when it was, back in the '60's [1960s] or something like that.  I was at a recording studio, and I was doing a deal with a, the, the producer.  And he said well, you know, Stravinsky is recording over in, in the other studio.  And I said yeah, I'd like to meet him.  I like his work, man.  I had all of his scores.  And when I met him, and he, when he met me and found out I was from New Orleans [Louisiana], he was fascinated to meet me, and went to tell me about how he had written a thing for Benny Goodman, and he wrote a thing called the "Ebony Suite," 'cause he thought of jazz as the music of the future.  He just thought of it, and many Europeans had already peeped the complexity of what we were doing.  And over the last few years, it, it becomes evident that more of the European musicians are opting to go into jazz as, as, as, as, as a, as an accomplishment to be able to achieve.  So all that started at, at Dillard [Dillard University, New Orleans, Louisiana], you know, when I was there.
Story_ID: 72249
Speaker 1: Now, now who were some of your favorite musicians, you know, in those days?  Who, who did you look up to and think was really doing some really famous--
Speaker 2: The kind of music I--well, it was so many of it, but I guess the name that pops out, you know, I, I, I liked the way that Sonny Rollins played.  I liked Charlie Parker too.  Of course Charlie was a, you know, he was the one who got all of us excited.  But, so, between those two, because I was playing saxophone, you know, those were the guys.  But you know, I, I didn't have a real outstanding favorite because I, I, when if I'm listening to Charlie Parker, that's--he's the favorite.  And, and--but cats said I guess--I'd say Sonny Rollins, 'cause cats would always say that I sounded like that when I played--tell me he sounded--you know, I liked his--we had a certain rhythm, that kind of thing that, that, that was similar.
Speaker 1: Did you ever meet Sonny Rollins?
Speaker 2: No, I never met him, I never met Sonny.  I never met Charlie Parker.  I never--that was one of the deficits in being in this place.  We didn't--we weren't on the trail, you know, where a lot of cats came through New Orleans [Louisiana].
Story_ID: 72250
Speaker 1: Now that's odd that, that you say that because, you know, people have the impression in, in the rest of the country jazz comes from New Orleans [Louisiana].  And you would think that all the musicians would pass through here at some point or--
Speaker 2: Well, if they passed, they passed real fast (laughter).  I mean a lot of what happened was--I mean it's the town, yeah, the town did, but it always did export to jazz mostly.  You know, since the early days, the cats who played that, the ones that most people know about, had to leave New Orleans to become known.  If Louis Armstrong had never gone anywhere, y'all might not know about him.  He'd still be Louis Armstrong.  And that's, that's part of this effort that I'm still working on is the fact that the sound--this, the town, the culture here produces per capita way more musicians than New York even.  'Cause people go to New York, but people are born here and, and, and die here, and, and you never know what they're doing.  And I'm sure they are great players in all their areas.  But per capita, this is a small town, and when you go through the books and see, well, he's from New Orleans, going back to Buddy Bolden to Sidney Bechet and all of those cats that came out of New Orleans.  And, and, and not until recently did they realize that, you know, it's happening again with Wynton Marsalis, and Branford, and Terence Blanchard [HM], and Donald Harrison, and Nicholas Payton, and all these cats coming from the neighborhood, right here, this one little small town.  And during when we were coming up, when I was young, New Orleans was going through its, its rhythm and blues phase, so we had Fats Domino, and we had Roy Brown and all of them.  Even those that didn't live here came here and got their career.  Ray Charles came here and hung around in the studios here and played with Guitar (unclear) and all these cats.  And New Orleans began to--be, became the old--the, the place before Motown, but there was no Motown here.  There was just the studio here and the musicians where all of them would come to record; all the little independent labels would come here to record and take their stuff and go on.
Speaker 1: I remember Fats Domino was a big star in the '50's [1950s]; he was huge.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was, he was, he was, he was--him, Little Richard re--recorded all his stuff here, so that's what--see, we, we, we became a place where all of the independent record labels know they could come and get 'em a hit.  So the jazz sort of took a sideline to that for a while, and that's when we were coming up; and hence, the, the, the jazz element sort of passed a generation until the '70's [1970s], late '70's [1970s] and '80's [1980s], when Wynton [Marsalis] came along.
Story_ID: 72251
Speaker 1: Now when you're at were--when, when you were at Dillard, did--who were some of your favorite European musicians and stuff that--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: [Igor] Stravinsky, Stravinsky was, you know, I mean he, he head and shoulders of me because I really studied his music 'cause he would always fascinated me.  And it was--there was also [Bela] Bartok, and Bartok was the next--I mean I studied him pretty well.  I really liked the way he, he wrote.  And, and I got a, a broad spectrum of most, most of the Europeans cats, going back before him, you know, before the mod--what they call so-called modern period.  I liked [Graeme] Revell from the Romantic period; I really liked Revell, the way that he, the way he used harmonics structures and so forth like that.  The other cats before that, they were fascinating, you know, Beethoven [Ludwig van Beethoven] and Mozart [Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart], those cats that--Mozart mainly because he wrote a lot of stuff, you know, like we used to play for a clarinet concertos and stuff like that.  And I got to the point where I could recognize him like I could recognize a jazz player.  I could recognize his licks, the things that he, that he always use.  And no matter what he was writing, I could tell, oh, that's through--that's, that's, that's a lick that he'll use, but.
Story_ID: 72252
Speaker 1: So is there anything that, that, that happened at Dillard [Dillard University, New Orleans, Louisiana] that was outstanding and really outstanding in your development that you wanna mention?
Speaker 2: Well, when you say outstanding, no, I don't, I don't recall anything that, any one thing that, that happened.  You know, as I said, the general thing was that, you know, we were able to begin to play.  And, and when Ellis [Ellis Marsalis, Jr.,HM] got there and we had another student named (unclear)--a cat named Cedar Walton who came through, and he went to school there for a while.  His--
Speaker 1: What was his name?
Speaker 2: Cedar Walton.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He was a well-known (unclear) New York musician now.  He was there for a while, and that encouraged us to have--he was in college then.  I don't know--he's from Texas, but he came here to go to college.  I don't know why he came to Dillard, but he, he did and helped us a lot.  Main thing, I mean, what happened while I was--during one--in my career at Dillard, I started playing professionally out with a group called the Johnson Brothers, were a pop band.  Plas Johnson, as a sax--tenor saxophone player, I--you probably don't know his name, but you probably know his music.  You ever heard the, the "Pink Panther" theme?  That's Plas Johnson, who, who, who created that "Pink Panther" theme, and that was Plas Johnson who played--he was a saxophonist (unclear) in Los Angeles [California] for years, who played on all the records.  He was the first call sax--
Speaker 1: Did he play the sax on the "Pink Panther" theme?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's him; that's his saxophone.
Speaker 1: Everybody thinks it's Henry Manc--well, they--
Speaker 2: No, it's Henry Mancini's--wrote the music.  He didn't write Plas's solo.  You know, Plas--he hired Plas on the record (unclear).  Pink--Mancini did the score for the movie, but it was--and that's what Plas did.  He was--he became the first call studio musician out there; and hence, his saxophone sound became the sound that everybody wanted to have.  And he played on many of the rock 'n roll records, you know, that came out of that period.  He wound up being the saxophone player on "The Merv Griffin Show" for years.  And now he's playing--he just let all that go.  Now he just plays jazz tours and goes and plays festivals and so forth.
Speaker 1: That's something--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: But that was the first band that I played in, you know, the first band where I got a uniform cord.  And I was in college and I got a uniform cord to play with the Johnson Brothers.
Speaker 1: Okay, what was his first, first name again, Plas?
Speaker 2: P-L-A-S.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Plas Johnson, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Go and find his name on the Internet, you'll find a whole lot of stuff man.
Story_ID: 72253
Speaker 1: Okay, now, when you were--tell me about graduation from Dillard [Dillard University, New Orleans, Louisiana], and what did you have in mind when you, when you graduated?
Speaker 2: Well, I knew that when I graduated from Dillard I was gonna go teach school somewhere, 'cause my major was music education.  That was a compromise that I came with my mother [Pearl Battiste], who, you know, since I wasn't gonna go in to be a doctor, then what was I gonna do.  So being a teacher was respectable, so my--you know, I'm graduated.  I guess it was beheld whatever it was.  And I--so I was, started sending out applications to see where I was gonna go teach.  And by, by September I had a job out in the rural area in Louisiana.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you were, you were teaching out in a rural area--(unclear) that was (unclear)--
Speaker 2: DeRidder. DeRidder, Louisiana.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and that was a wonderful period.  I mean I enjoyed that.  I just stayed there two years, but it was--I've never forgotten.  I still have pictures of all of my kids who was in that, in that, those two years of my life, man.  It was very--I mean 'cause I grew up then.  I mean, you know, 'cause I was only twenty when I finished, and some of the students was 19 (laughter), eighteen and nineteen years old.  And so I was the youngest cat on the faculty of course.  And then they had never had music before in, in that little town.  They had to start from real scratch with kids who didn't know the names of instruments.  So it was real, it was--I didn't realize what a challenge it was, 'cause I had never done anything before.  I just said okay, this is what I got to do; I'll start a music program here.  And it was very, very rewarding.  I mean the whole, the whole idea of get--introducing the parents and the kids to what music was about and teaching them--setting up ways to get the instruments.  That's was the big problem, you know, 'cause the school board wasn't gonna give 'em any instruments down there.  And in, in fact, begrudgingly, they didn't wanna give us any uniforms.  Of course, that, that was out of the question.  But we had to struggle to get those things.  And then by the end of the first year, there I was, I had the kids read fo--to play a concert.  They didn't have uniforms or anything like that, but they, they had got the basic instruments.  Their parents really supported me in that way.  They bought 'em clarinets and trumpets and all that stuff, and they just had the faith that it was gonna be a good thing.  And in second year we really were trying to--what we had done, I, what I did, I started, I put up a little protest march [cough] with signs saying "Future band of Carver High School."  It was called Carver High School.  And we put a little pressure on the school board, so finally we were able to get--the second year we were able to get uniforms and a couple of instruments.
Speaker 1: Now, now what year is this, is this?
Speaker 2: We're talking about 1952 and '3' [1953], 1952 and 1953, 19--yeah, yeah, 'cause '54' [1954]--yeah.  Well, you know how the schools, they go cross years.  This was 50--'52' [1952]-'53' [1953] and '53' [1953]-'54' [1954].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so those were the two years.
Story_ID: 72254
Speaker 1: So what did you do when you left that school [Carver High School, DeRidder, Louisiana], or, or why did you leave that school?
Speaker 2: Well, I left it--well, two reason:  One reason was that I ran into my first real blatant racism there.  I mean I had to, had a meeting.  My principal of my school had a meeting at the school board, and he wanted to--he was trying to help impress them that we needed, you know, what we needed for the band, and so he had (unclear) asked me to come with him.  And when, and when they spoke to--the way they spoke to him in front of me just, I mean it just, it, it, it embarrassed me and made me real angry, 'cause they was calling him boy and talking about y'all always want something down there.  And as soon as y'all see these children up here got something, y'all want it.  Now you know--they just talked to him real bad.  And Mr. King, who was the pra--who's name, his name--you know, that was my principal and I'm st--standing right there.  They had no regard for that, and I realized that they just, you know.  And he diplomatically, you know, he knew who he was dealing with better than I know, so he--"yes, yeah, I understand; you're right, Mr. Handtree (ph.)."  Mr. Handtree was the name of the superin--you know.  But after that, when I went back, I realized that I wasn't gonna be able to stay there, 'cause I'd probably get in trouble.  That plus the fact that my mother [Pearl Battiste] really wanted me to come back home, and that was the first time I had been away from home, you know, out on my own like that.  And, and as much as I loved those kids and stuff there, my, my, my--I knew that I wouldn't be able to be safe around there.  So my mother found out that there as an opening here in New Orleans [Louisiana], so I came back to teach school in New Orleans.
Story_ID: 70282
Speaker 1: Now, so, so you're, you're now back in New Orleans [Louisiana]--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --about 1955.
Speaker 2: Fifty--yeah, '54 [1954], the September of '54 [1954].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, and then that was also to be another--I mean it was a two-year stint.  I, I, I taught when I came back here [cough].  In New Orleans they had what they call itinerant teachers, where you--they had one school that it was the base, but then you'd go to several other schools, you know, like once or twice a week or something like that.  And there I--so I was based first at Carter G. Woodson High School [cough], and it was a junior high school.  And then the second year I was here I was based at McDonogh 35, which was a high school.  And in the interim I, I had several elementary schools that I would go to during the week to teach.
Story_ID: 70283
Speaker 1: And at one of, one of the, the--I guess the most significant thing that sort of ended my career as a teacher was that during that period I had become interested in the Black Muslims.  A guy named Emory Thompson began to talk to me.  I had been hearing about him.  It was during that period that I got really, you know, to understand what they were talking about (unclear)--the principles.  And we had a music supervisor here.  The music supervisor would go over to all the schools and inspect to see what you teaching and see how you teaching and doing it like that.  And our supervisor came to my school one day, and he observed my class.  Then he brought me on the side and said, you know, you're spending too much time teaching them about reading music and stuff like that.  Their parents just wanna hear 'em play some songs.  And I'm saying hey, what do you mean--and, and at that time, I had been having my little talks, you know, with, with the cat from, from the, from the, from the mosque.  Well we didn't have a mosque at that time.  The cat just had a place where they would get together.  And he had, one of the things he had said, says you know, if you ever look at this devil, just look 'em dead in the eye, and he'll back down.  So I did that (unclear)--but he--but when he said that to me, I just looked him dead in the eye.  And I had never done that before, and he probably had never had that done to him, 'cause he did back off.  'Cause I told him, you know, and I told him, I said look, I know what they're teaching in them white schools.  And you don't want me to teach my kids how to read.  And then when they get to the next level, you'll say they're not equipped to, to participate.  So (clearing throat) I know what I'm, I'm--these are my kids.  I'mma teach 'em how to read.  So the school board took that as a--what do they call it?  What's that when you--the school board just thought that--they sent me a letter to come down and meet at the--
Speaker 2: They thought it was like insubordination?
Speaker 1: Yeah, insubordination, you know.  So I had to go down (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) All you did was look him in the eye.
Speaker 1: Yeah, (laughter) that's (unclear), but I also told him that I wasn't gon' do what he said (laughter).
Speaker 2: Oh (unclear).
Speaker 1: So that's what they got me on.  So I went down to the school board and we met.  And see, the cat was just--I mean all of us knew; all the music teachers knew that this supervisor didn't--I mean he was a, he--it was a political job; he was appointed.  He didn't know what he was doing.  So I told him down there at the, at the school board the same thing I told the cat up there.  And so the conclusion was that well, I had the option, you know, that I could either comply or I could offer my resignation.  And so I said that, that settled that.  I just said well, I'm, I'm gone.  That was in '56 [1956], so I left.  That's when I decided that yeah, I'm, I'm not meant to get in, be in the school system, not, not, not the way it is now.  And that summer, that summer is when I left and went to Los Angeles [California].
Story_ID: 70284
Speaker 1: So you went to Los Angeles [California] then?
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: Now, now why did you choose to go to Los Angeles?  Did you know somebody there or did you have a--
Speaker 2: No, I didn't know any [clearing throat]--
Speaker 1: Was Plas Johnson, was, was Plas Johnson out there?
Speaker 2: No, it was--well, it wasn't--yeah, Plas was out there, but that was not why I went.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I went because it was a, a drummer named Edward Blackwell, who was, you know.  Anyway, Edward Blackwell had--he knew somebody there.  He knew Ornette Coleman.  Or--Ornette Coleman had spent some time in New Orleans.  That was when--you know, before I knew him.  And he got to know some cats around there.  Well, Blackwell was one of the cats, and Blackwell was trying to get back out to Los Angeles.  In June, in June of that year he had got next to Ellis Marsalis [HM] and convinced Ellis to let's go to Los Angeles.  Then when they found out that I was--I had resigned, and I had a car, so they got me in on the plot to go to Los Angeles.  And I'll never forget, man, while we were preparing to go, that's when Clifford Brown--I don't know if you're familiar with Clifford Brown, trumpet player.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: That's when he got killed in that summer that--and we got the news that he had died in an automobile wreck.  And [Edward] Blackwell, who always tried to play, you know, hard and macho, (unclear) well, he's just a dead cat that's all, you know.  And it hurt me when he said that about Clifford, man.  Man, I said well, man, I'm not gonna go nowhere with y'all if that's the way you (unclear) think about Clifford--but I realized that that's just the way, that was his way of dealing with hurt.  He couldn't, you know, he couldn't accept it and fe--be soft.  He just act like that's, that's something you gotta be dealing with.  Anyway, we went, we went out to Los Angeles.  The three of us left and went out to Los Angeles.  And the only person anybody knew was, was Ornette Coleman, and so, so that's the first place we went, to his house, and set up that same day we got there and started jamming, started playing.  Edward set up his drums, and we started playing.  Didn't know what were gonna do, but we were here now.
Story_ID: 70285
Speaker 1: By that time, I had already--I had gotten married and I had a child, you know.
Speaker 2: So then the child was back here in--
Speaker 1: Yeah, in New Or--New Orleans [Louisiana].  You know, I left my wife and child back here.  And also Alvin Batiste, Alvin and I were very close.  I don't know if you were--and he's a clarinetist, and he's a teacher at (unclear) Seven.  He's, you know, he had gotten married also.  He and I were very close friends, and he had stood for me at my wedding, and I stood--me and my wife stood for him at his wedding.  But how it related to this was after the three of us, Ellis [Ellis Marsalis Jr., HM], [Edward] Blackwell, and myself, went out to Los Angeles [California], within two or three weeks my wife was ready to--
Speaker 2: Come back.
Speaker 1: --either come home or you--I'm coming in, one or the two.  So Alvin, Alvin and his wife and my--and his child and my wife and my child, they all got in the car and came out to Los Angeles about, about two or three weeks after we were there.  So that started, you know, me setting down roots, try to set down roots in, in Los Angeles.
Story_ID: 70286
Speaker 1: So did you, you--did you think you would just play in gigs with--
Speaker 2: with Ornette [Coleman]?
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: No, I'm say--I--it was such a spontaneous move, I didn't--my eyes was on how, you know, could the jazz players in New Orleans [Louisiana], how could I get them out there.  I had to find out, you know--I just had so much to learn about being away from home.  I had never been away from home, so I didn't know what I was gonna do.  My thought was that maybe I could teach school out there, you know, or something like that.  I made applications, then I did, I did find a lady that had known my family was out there, Ms. Annabel Jackson.  In fact, Ms. Annabel Jackson had been a kindergarten teacher of mine.  So they were out there, and she was working at the po--her and her husband worked at the post office so they thought about getting me a job at the post office, which I did, got a job at the post office for a little while and whatever I could do, do to sustain us.  And--but in the meantime, we were trying to, you know, deal with Ornette's music.  We had one gig a week; we played one gig a week in a little Mexican joint downtown for about six bucks or seven dollars (unclear) get paid.  But it allowed us to experiment with the, with Ornette was trying to do, which was--
Speaker 1: Yeah, Or--Ornette Coleman was a different kind of musician--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Oh, very, very different.
Speaker 1: He played a, a fiberglass saxophone first, which was odd.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, he--
Speaker 1: He was kind of odd and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was very different--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous)--innovative--
Speaker 2: Yeah, he--that's, that's, so that's what we were going through that period with him when he was trying to figure out how to play music the way he wanted to play it, as opposed to the way it was being played at the time.  And we would just get laughed at.  We'd come to jam sessions, man, the cats would look at us and say oh Lord, here comes this cat, man, you know.  But--
Speaker 1: I heard they would laugh.  When Ornette Coleman first started they'd laugh at his saxophone the first thing.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: What in the world is that?
Speaker 2: What is that?  And then, then it--then the way he played it, you know, it was just seemingly outrageous, you know.  But Ornette was very, very focused on what he wanted to do.  When we got there, he used to work at a department store.  He was a freight elevator operator at a, a department store.  He had his horn then; he'd be going up and down all day practicing his horn in the freight elevator, man.  He was a--you know.
Story_ID: 70287
Speaker 1: But and that, that sort of--actually had that culminated in getting me started in the record--and understanding record recording because we went in to do a little demo with some of his [Ornette Coleman] tunes.  He had written a few little tunes, and we all, we went in the studio and made a demo, then the next thing was to try to shop it around.  So they sort of elected me to go out to Hollywood and see if we can go get somebody to listen to it.  And in, in my rounds out there, I ran into a guy named Bumps Blackwell [Robert "Bumps" Blackwell], who had--was working for Specialty Records, did Little Richard and all that popular stuff, and used to--cat come down to New Orleans [Louisiana] to do record, so he knew my name.  He didn't, he didn't know me, but Battiste is a common name down there so they thought he knew me.  And so I thought that would be a good place to see if he would listen to our little demo, although Specialty was a jazz label.  And so I brought it to him.  But what, what-- the, the, the--irony was that--he was about to embark on doing a recording of Sam Cooke.  Sam Cooke was in, in a gospel group singing, which wa--I think it was the Pilgrim Travelers [The Soul Stirrers]--I forgot which, which gospel group it was, but Bumps' idea was to change him over to pop, 'cause he recognized that this cat could be a great pop singer, if we could, you know, take him out of gospel.  And he asked me to--he, he had planned a record, record date doing a song like sum--"Summertime," do a standard song with him sing with girls singing behind him and everything like that to introduce him to the pop world.  He had already tried it once, and they changed his name to Dale Cooke when at first when they tried.  But gospel people still recognized his voice.  See, they was trying to keep the gospel people from knowing that this was Sam Cooke singing.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Bolen (ph.).
Speaker 1: Yeah, he didn't (unclear)--but people--you know, he was too identified.  People knew his voice.  So he was just gonna go ahead and blatantly say okay, this is Sam.  Sam we're gonna do something new.  And when I showed up with this idea about jazz, Bumps asked me, well, look, man, you can help me do something.  We, we need something else, you know, to, to record on this cat for the B side of the record.  And he asked me to go take Sam down in a basement and listen to whatever songs he had, you know.  And among the stuff that he showed me, he had this song he would send me to just--you play this for me on the guitar and stuff like that.  And I changed a few things in it, and he said okay, good.  I didn't know much about it at all, so I just, you know, I just did what I thought.
Story_ID: 70288
Speaker 1: Okay, so the next day in the recording date, they had finished doing "Summertime," which was the B--the A side, that's what they were shooting for.  Bumps [Robert "Bumps" Blackwell] said well, what else y'all wanna do?  What else you got?  So we had this little song, didn't have any music written or anything.  He had these singers there that were for "Summertime."  They didn't have anything.  They needed music 'cause they--you know, so I had to write music for them.  And we started doing "You Send Me."  And the owner of the label came into the studio, and he heard what we were doing, and he really went bonkers.  He didn't like it at all.  He, he didn't like it.  He said what are you trying to do?  You trying make him white?  Why you got all them white girls singing back in there (unclear). For--see, he was used to gospel; he was used to Little Richard; he was used to Lyle--and he loved it.  He really loved it, but when he heard the way that was going, (unclear) said man, that ain't, what are y'all trying to do?  He fired the singers.  He took over the record (unclear)--(unclear).  And so evidently, you know, it just was a disaster.  Fortunately, we had got a couple of good takes.  And the next day he offered Bumps Blackwell, the guy who was the producer, he said Bumps, if you think this stuff is gonna--he didn't say stuff.  He--if you think this stuff is worth anything, the money I owe you and (unclear) and stuff, why don't you take--you can have this session if you think that's something, and I don't owe you nothing else.  So Bumps took it and split, and went to a friend of his named Bob Keane, and they put it out on Keane Records.  And (laughter) just blew up.
Speaker 2: Is history.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: Darling you--
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, yeah, and but that got the cats to know me, you know, 'cause Art Rue, who's the owner of the company, after that he hired me and start paying me, thought maybe I--'cause he was embarrassed after, you know, when he, he realized he had made a terrible mistake, you know, that his own prejudice had stopped him from hearing what the possibilities were.  But that got me introduced to, you know, what it would be like on the other side of-- you know, being a musician is being in the studios.  And that sent me back to New Orleans [Louisiana], and the cats let me--wanted me to set up an office in New Orleans for Specialty Records, which sent me back here to open a Specialty Records office in New Orleans.
Story_ID: 70289
Speaker 1: Okay, now did you produce any more music for Sam Cooke?
Speaker 2: No, I did some more music.  I, I wasn't a producer though.  I was the--a couple more things I arranged.  A lot of things I played on when--that was after--that was in the early, in the early '60's [1960s], after I had come back to New Orleans [Louisiana] for Specialty [Records].  And then--and I, I--when I got back to Los Angeles [California] again I hooked back up with Sam [Cooke].  By this time he was a big star, and so some of those last things--the last thing was "A Change is Gonna Come."  I played on that.  I forget some of those things.  A few, a few of those last couple of years, you know, when I got back out there, I, I was on some of--but what I did, what main thing when I went back out there, I approached Sam about starting up what, what eventually we called the Soul Stations.  I saw Los Angeles at that time with a lot of talent in the black community that, that had no way to, to, to get up to Hollywood.  I mean the few people that got to Hollywood was not necessarily the most talented people, 'cause should of--a lot of times talented people first of all, they don't realize how talented they are, and they--so they don't, they don't know how to take all of the steps that it takes to negotiate your way into a recording thing.  So the, the idea of the Soul Station was to play something in the community where they could come and audition and stuff and maybe get some kind of preparation to be--to, to go to Hollywood or to be directed on how they could, you know, make the transition from the environment and the, the most comfortable environment where they were to the, you know.  So he went--he, he, you know, he, he really endorsed it, and we got a little place down on Vermont Avenue and started the Soul Station operations.  So that was--in, in effect, that was a Sam Cooke thing, and--
Story_ID: 70290
Speaker 1: What he had me to do, he had a little record label of his own with a few artists and so forth so we did some of those.  And I guess the most significant from his label was Bobby Womack.  Bobby Womack had a--he, he and his brothers, they had a group called The Valentinos, and we did a record on them, which the Rolling Stones covered and became one of their first big hits; that's "Cause it's All Over Now"--[singing]--and I used to love you, but it's all over now.  And when the Roll, Rolling Stones covered it the song went big, and as a result, the Valentinos got some of, you know, which trickle down I guess from, from that.  And of course, then Bobby went out on his own.  But all of that started with Sam Cooke's little label that we did those things and several other things that went--never got--the, the Simms' Twin and I guess a lot of things, because there's , there's, there's a double CD compilation that's put out on about SAR Records.  But--so that was it for Sam.
Speaker 2: About what time period is this now?
Speaker 1: That was at--that was up to the--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--early (unclear) or--
Speaker 1: No, '60's [1960s].
Speaker 2: Sixties [1960s]?
Speaker 1: Yeah, that was up to the time when Sam got killed in, in '64 [1964].  We--I did that and you know, we did that until, until that time.
Story_ID: 70291
Speaker 1: In the meantime, well, actually what had happened with, when I came back to New Orleans [Louisiana] for Specialty [Records], I learned about, you know, some things about the recording thing that made me wanna--once again, in my, in my Harold X bag, I was thinking hey, why are we doing this for these people here we, we should be doing this for ourselves, you know.  And hence, so I, I formed a label called All For One Records.  That's when I started that record company and, and got some of the best musicians around, some of the cats who were playing records.  And they understood that they, you know, that hey, we're making--we're bringing the songs; were creating the arranges; we're doing these records, then we get--at that time the union scale was $41 and a quarter.  And we were getting $41 and a quarter, and the cat would walk off with the tapes.  And we just wait for him to come back so we can make another $41 and a quarter, which was good money for those days.  But compared to what they yielded was nothing.  And I figured it out that I took a, a sample of one musician I knew who was playing on all those record labels.  I said now if this cat only makes--if, if instead of getting that 41 and a quarter for all the record dates he does, which yields him about, about--I figured out the amount that he would get in the year.  Then I said now, if, if just on one of those records, if it sold 500,000 copies and he had two cents royalty, he'd have ten times the amount for that than he got doing records dates.  And they all understood that, so that was the basis on which we started our own label.  And fortunately, on the first records that we put out, it was a regional hit, and the second record became a gold record.
Story_ID: 70292
Speaker 1: And none of us really knew what we were doing (unclear)--them, and we thought we knew.  I mean it was my fault.  I, I, I was really naive for thinking that I, I, I knew something about the record business.  I know how to make records, and I know how to make things that people like, but as far as distribution and sales and all of that other elements that go along with a hit record, I didn't, I didn't know.  So after about-- after, after we had the big hit, the guy who was handling our national distribution convinced our artist that we--she should sign with him.  The girl named Barbara George, she had a record called "I Know," which went to number three in the nation.
Speaker 2: How did that go--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: [Singing]--I know you don't love me no more--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --oh no more.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's right.
Speaker 1: --or no more.  And then it had a cornet, so I wrote a little trumpet solo.  Instead of having saxophone or guitar, I just wrote a trumpet solo for it, and it became famous.
Story_ID: 70293
Speaker 1: Yeah. And--but that was a, a backfire, 'cause of my racist attitude.  It backfired on me because when this guy heard out what we were gonna do, he was gonna let--handle the national distribution.  And I, I was prepared to have, you know, you're gonna have white distributors 'cause they ain't got--I didn't know they had in black ones.  But when he got off the plane he was black.  I said oh, man, we, we got a black distributor.  But that, and that was my first real lesson that don't judge a book by the cover (laughter), you know, 'cause this cat--soon we had this big hit with the girl.  He got up in New York and bought her a Cadillac, a fur coat, with her money, but she didn't know it was her money, and convinced her that she should sign up with him because we didn't know what we was doing.  Well, he was right, we didn't know what we was doing, 'cause we--
Speaker 2: (Unclear)--
Speaker 1: That's why I got him (laughter), 'cause we didn't know what we was doing.  So he got, he got Barbara [George] from us, but she never had another hit after that, you know.  And I tried to tell him, I said man, you know, why you doing this. 'cause what--we, we just, all we wanna do is give you hits?
Story_ID: 70294
Speaker 1: In the meantime I had done another one for another cat out of New York, Bobby Robinson.  He had a record label up there too.  And we did a thing (unclear) here called "Ya Ya" by a cat named Lee Dorsey.
Speaker 2: Yeah--[singing]--sitting in the--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Yeah, sitting--
Speaker 2: --waiting on (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, yeah, done that record.  And see, that was for Bobby Robinson.  When Bobby put that out before he put ja--"I Know" out.  So he was made with us because we gave that to Bobby Robinson.  And our concept was that, man, the AFO [All For One Records] idea of all for one meaning all of us.  You know, we'll--we can do this.  We can make records for y'all all the time, you just give 'em, you know.  But I, I didn't understand that mentality that that they had, you know, in New York of that kind of competition.  So he was sort of pissed with us.  And so that, that dissolved our distribution deal and left us with the record label that--I was still determined to make records better than I--we didn't have no way of distributing it.  So I--we--I, I figured we--I wanted to record some jazz things 'cause nobody was recording the jazz stuff that here.  And so I brought Ellis Marsalis [Ellis Marsalis, Jr., HM] in the studio.  He had a group.  We had a group, about three jazz groups.  We, we didn't know--da, didn't plan to sell no records.  We just wanted to record them.  And that's been the most lasting thing for the little label, you know, the fact that we recorded those jazz things.
Story_ID: 70295
Speaker 1: Let's backtrack a little bit.  It might be the wrong time to start this, but what, but what kind of a person was Sam Cooke?
Speaker 2: Oh--
Speaker 1: I know he died amidst--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --a lot of controversy.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was--that was Melton (ph.).
Speaker 1: There's a play that's written about him in Chicago [Illinois] that ran in the, in the local back theaters--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah?
Speaker 1: --that ETA Creative Arts Foundation did.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I mean people are fascinated by--
Speaker 2: Sam.
Speaker 1: --the story of Sam Cooke that's told--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --about every Sunday on the Dusties station--
Speaker 2: Oh really?
Speaker 1: --by Herb Kent [HM].  He tells--he talks about how Sam, you know, Sam Cooke, and Bobby Womack, and Sam Cooke's wife and, and all the mystery around his death and you know.  What, what, what was--
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 1: We'll change tape.
Story_ID: 70296
Speaker 1: [What kind of person is Sam Cooke and if you maybe give us your opinions of all the controversy around his death and what you heard from the inside I guess about it.]
Speaker 2: Well, I mean, to me it was--my personal relationship with Sam was one that made me see a beautiful side of a, of an extremely talented man who also was very conscious of, of the racial situation.  He was very--those, those last--when I went back out to Los Angeles [California], we talked a lot at his hou--house about, you know, he was close friends with a lot of the Muslim people.  And he was very conscious of that, that's why I guess he went for the concept of the so--Soul Station; he understood all of those things.  And the--his--the, the, the circumstances surrounding his death, my--when it first hit me that morning, one of them, they called me up.  It couldn't have happened to I mean a most unlikely person, I mean to be--to die in that circumstance was not Sam Cooke at all.  That was, you know--it really, it really hurt me that that would be the legacy of what people would remember.
Story_ID: 70297
Speaker 1: Just briefly, can you re, recap what the story has been or what, what they, what, what, what people said happened?
Speaker 2: Well, I, from what I get of it, they said that he, he picked up this girl and went down to a motel on Figueroa where all the motels were.  And the, the, the, the, the girl was evidently trying to roll him.  You know, she--and taken his pants or something like that with--I don't know--I guess with his money in it and so forth like that and split out.  And he, and came out in pursuit of her, and he knocked on the door of the office, you know, to, to find out what had happened.  And the lady wouldn't open the door, and he broke the--open or something like that, where he broke in on, broke in to find out what was going on, and the lady shot him.  And she claimed self-defense.  And just-and I don't know--you know, I mean I don't know what the legal--in fact, I heard the legal outcome was that they--she was able to sue his estate or something like that, as though he had accosted her, you know.  But it's just the whole idea of Sam being in a circumstance like that.  And I, I personally believe--maybe I shouldn't say that, but I always personally believed that it was because he was not really comfortable and happy at his home.  Sam--from what I experienced at their home, Barbara [Campbell] was not really in his corner, you know.  And I think he had married her--I don't, I don't know the circumstances, but what I get, he, he married her under the circumstances because he was a good cat.  And she was not really the kind of lady that he should have married.  If there was something that ever happened, he should have just taken that--taken care of her and not bring her into his life and try to make a lady out of her.  Because we would be at the house talking, and Barbara would come in and she'd get dressed up and go out.  And just, she never was like a part of the household, and I could tell that Sam was not really comfortable in his home.  And hence, I figure, well, maybe that's why he was out there, you know.  I mean, he just--you know.  Anyway, he's a beautiful cat though, Barry, he was a beautiful--
Speaker 1: Now this--I had heard a rumor too about some kind of--him getting ready to change a record contract or something around that time, or something.  Do, do you know anything about it?
Speaker 2: No, but I know he was, he was, he was, he was very conscious of ownership.  You know, he was one of the first cats that I knew, you know, who--yeah, who wanted to negotiate with those big people about his rights and about his, you know, not only to have ownership, but also artistic control of what he did.  You know, he wanted, he wanted to do, do for himself what he knew best to do.  So I don't know personally what the specifics of it is, his contract.
Story_ID: 70298
Speaker 1: Okay, so, well, back to--catch back up where we were.  We were talking about Lee Dorsey doing "Ya Ya."
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: And did, did you all do the "Working in the Coal Mine?"
Speaker 2: No, no, no, that was--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --another period.  See, this was the beginning of Lee Dorsey.  I mean I, I, I met Lee Dorsey through a guy named Reynolds Richards, who was managing Lee at that time.  And, and he did--here I went out to a little country town where they was usually rehearsing Lee.  And he had another--it was a song--I for--what was that song called--"Lottie Mo," "Lottie Mo."  That was the first thing that Lee Dorsey did.  And that, that's what I also--no, that wasn't when I met Allen Toussaint.  I had met Allen Toussaint before then.  I don't know if you know who Allen Toussaint is.
Speaker 1: I've heard the name.
Speaker 2: Allen Toussaint is a New Orleans [Louisiana] producer who, very prolific songwriter.  He, he's our--the New Orleans version of say, Stevie Wonder I mean.  He's a, he's, he wrote "Working in the Coal Mine."  Anyway, he was playing piano at that time, he was early in his career.  He played piano on the record "Lottie Mo" that I did.  Then, then he was supposed to do "Ya Ya," because he was a good music--good songwriter.  I don't know if--but when Bobby Robinson man came down here to do that, they went to Allen, but Allen was under contract to somebody else and he couldn't do it.  So they asked me would I do it, and I did it.  And I hired a piano player to play sort of like Allen, you know, hired him and did that, that record.  And that was the only record I did because I had my own little label then, you know.  AFO [All For One Records] had got started, and we had done that Barbara George stuff, and Prince La La, and a few other things.  So I didn't--Allen didn't start doing Lee Dorsey for another two or three years.  You know, that's when Lee Dorsey started coming back with all of those hits with "Working in the Coal Mine" and old--no, I forget, I forget some of them, but there, there was another--Allen got a deal with another company and started doing those.
Story_ID: 70299
Speaker 1: So that takes us to about 1963, '64 [1964], right?
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm, yeah, that was when I was back (unclear).  By then I was gone back out to Los Angeles [California].  I left here in '63 [1963] and went back out to Los Angeles and hooked up with Sam [Cooke].  And then, and Sonny [Bono] found again out there, you know, and that's when he had--
Speaker 1: Now how did--yeah, when did you first meet Sonny--
Speaker 2: Sonny?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I had met Sonny when I first, the first time I did the, the "You Send Me" thing; I met Sonny.  Sonny used to--at that point, Sonny was, he was writing songs.  He was hustling songs at that time, and he--
Speaker 1: That's Sonny Bono?
Speaker 2: Sonny Bono, yeah.  And he would come by the, by Specialty [Records], you know, trying to get somebody to record some of his material.  And he used to drive a beat truck.  You know, while he was out on his route, he would go over to record companies and bring his songs and stuff like that.  And he was a good hustler man.  He was, he was another cat who was very focused, man.  He knew, he knew where the prize was, and he, you know, he was willing to do the things that it took to get there. But as I said, after, after the, the record company [Specialty Records] made the faux pas on--with "You Send Me," he--the, the guy hired both me and Sonny [Bono], and sent me back here to start an office here [New Orleans, Louisiana], and Sonny worked that office out there [Los Angeles, California].  So we worked together about three years as A and R [artists and repertoire] men for, for Specialty Records and.
Story_ID: 70300
Speaker 1: That's what (unclear)--(unclear)--and see I started my label after, after our thing ended with Specialty Records.  The owner of Specialty Records got tired of the record business.  He didn't need it or anything.  It was just fun to him 'cause he was an oil man.  So he got tired of it.  He got tired of the, the concept--we, we--of, of payola.  That was when the payola thing got big.  And he said Bat, he said man, why, why, why are we gonna pay these guys?  These guys don't know how (unclear)--but play records.  We spend all our money and talent to get the most talented musicians or--
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA INTERRUPTION):  We need to pause for a second.
Speaker 1: (OFF0CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, okay. Yeah, the owner of the Specialty Records, we used have chats, 'cause I really didn't--I wanted to learn as much as I could from, from Art [Rupe], and he did teach me a lot.  And at that point, he, he was always sort of philosophical about himself.  And he said Bat, why would we pay?  I mean we spend thousands of dollars to get the most talented musicians we know.  We hire a studio, and we get all of the, you know, best things we can to make music.  Then we take our product to a cat who is a radio announcer.  What does he know?  And, and, and, and we're subject to whether he likes it or not.  If he doesn't like it, we don't--then our money's gone down the drain.  So he said I'm not gonna pay him.  'Cause if we don't make no records, what is he gonna do?  He's gonna sit up there and talk?  He said--so that was his, his, his point of view, that--about payola.  He said I'm not gonna pay no radio announcer to pass judgment on, on something that we've done.  But anyway, so he, he folded up.  He just folded up, you know.
Story_ID: 70301
Speaker 1: And so he [Art Rupe] made a deal with me to continue producing independently stuff for them if I wanted to.  And Sonny [Bono] was who was out there.  I have letters from Sonny, and Sonny was, you know--well, he said some bad things about Art [Rupe].  But he, he knew that it was time to get out.  And he was writing me then about me coming back out to Los Angeles [California] because he figured that we could really make it together, he and I.  But I had started my own little label [All For One Records] here so, and that was in '61 [1961].  By '61 [1961] I was, you know, and I didn't get back out there till '63 [1963], yeah.  So Sonny, you know, Sonny--I had known him since '58 [1958], '57 [1957] or '58 [1958], when I was at Specialty.  And he always had a thing in mind that he wanted to do along with me.  And when I got back out there and hooked up with Sam [Cooke], he found me.  And he had found Cher by then, and that's when we--he came back.
Story_ID: 70302
Speaker 1: Okay, now, now what's the first project you worked on with Sonny?
Speaker 2: With Sonny?  The first thing I did when--in that time period wa--oh, I'm sorry; I keep leaning up--was a little song called "The Letter."  He just wanted to do something to get Cher's, Cher, 'cause Cher wanted to re--you know, she liked to be around musicians.  And he was really in love with her.  He wanted to impress her.  And so, he asked me would I help him record his record, so I wrote, I wrote out the arrangements and so forth for this song and something else.  And he went in the studio by himself.  It was a cat had a little record label.  I forgot the name of that label.  The cat's name was Jack Lewerke.  He was really a distributor, and he had a little record label, Vault Records, Vault Records.  And they put the record out as Caesar and Cleo; that's what they called themselves, their first little record (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: Caesar and Cleo, okay.
Speaker 2: That was just around the time that record--that movie came out with, with Cla--
Speaker 1: "Cleopatra."
Speaker 2: --Cleopatra, yeah--
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: --with, with--who it was, you know.
Speaker 1: Elizabeth Taylor and--
Speaker 2: And yeah, Burton.
Speaker 1: Richard Burton.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so they, they figured they'd do a spoof of that (unclear)--not a spoof, but a, a mimic.  They just gonna do that, called themselves Caesar and Cleo.  And she had the cold rider's haircut and everything like that.  And the record, the record got airplay and so forth like that, but it didn't really do that much.
Speaker 1: It's called "The Letter?"
Speaker 2: "The Letter," yeah, that was on the A side.  And I forgot what was on the B side, yeah.  Then--but anyway, so I decided I didn't wanna do that.  You know, I, I didn't wanna really get involved, 'cause I was busy with Sam [Cooke] and with the Soul Station and doing those things over there.
Story_ID: 70303
Speaker 1: Then he [Sonny Bono] came back and said they had gotten a little deal with Reprieve Records, and they were gonna go in there and do something.  So he asked me to come once again, and so I went again, and I actually went to the studio that time and played some.  It was a song called "Baby Don't Go."  It was in--and there again, it was intended for Cher to do, but she was sort of shy, so he sang along with her.  And so we did that record.  It did a little better, "Baby Don't Go."  Well, it didn't do, you know, enough to people know it, and they did that one as Sonny and Cher.  Then, and all this is within less than a year's time sev--a few months' time.  They got a deal.  They got two little New York hustlers to be their managers, a guy named Charlie Green and Bryan Stone, two guys.  So they got 'em a deal with Atlantic Records to go in the studio.  And so they, they figured they had some money, and so we went in the studio and did a thing called "Just You" with a big, big bunch of musicians.  That's what Sonny really wanted to do something like.  He wanted--he was a Phil Spector groupie.  He loved Phil, Phil Spector; in fact, he worked for Phil Spector a while.  So he wanted to do something like that.  We did a big thing like that, which, which that didn't go too well.
Story_ID: 70304
Speaker 1: But the next record we did was 'I Got You Babe,' which we followed the same thing, and I, you know, I just wrote the music.  And I was--by that time, I was going in the studio and conduct the studio or the session.  And they, you know, they was very enthusiastic about that, you know, being record (unclear).  I still wasn't considering myself, you know, doing that.  I was just--that was just helping him do something.  But after that, when it got such a hit, you know, he said well, man, you know you gotta--you know, I mean this is gon' be it, so this is the thing I was talking about it.  So by that time, that's when Sam [Cooke] had already died.  So I just said well, this is whatever I agreed on with that.  I went on with him, and so that, that, you know, set the stage for me being with Sonny and Cher for him, you know, the rest of this time.
Speaker 2: Yeah, 'I Got You Babe' came out was it '65 [1965] I guess?
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think it was '65 [1965]; it was '65 [1965], yeah.  And it was really, you know, it was a whole na- 'nother direction for me, you know.  I had never thought I'd be--wind up that far away from jazz (laughter), you know that, that--but it--funny enough, I mean I learned something about myself.  In retrospect, that--how most things that, that came to me in my life offered an interesting challenge to me, and that's what hooked me, was see, can I do that?  Yeah, I can do this.  Can I do this?  Let me see, can I--so that made me forget that this is not what I really came out here to do.  Let me see, you know, 'cause I get hooked right on that.  And once I got hooked into doing that stuff and it was that successful, you know, it, it made me feel na, na- oh yeah, that's okay, I can do this.  And so every record, you know, we, we--and you know, just kept having hit records.  You know, every five or six months we have another main seller.  And then and I was doing the albums in between that, so I was making a lot of money, you know, more than I ever thought I'd make, you know, doing something like this is, you know.  So that became my life for the next few years.
Story_ID: 70305
Speaker 1: Yeah, 'cause they lasted a long time, from '65 [1965], and they kept getting bigger and bigger until 19--their TV show came on the air, what in the mid '70's [1970s]?
Speaker 2: Well, well, they had two different T--shows.  They, they had one that came on in the early '70's [1970s], and that's when--then they broke up, and then she had a show and he had a show.  His show didn't last, and hers didn't really last, but hers was rescued when they called him back in '75 [1975].  And--
Speaker 1: That's right, that's right, that is, that's an odd kind of thing (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous)--came back, right?
Speaker 2: They came back and that--then by then they were divorced, but they came back on television.  And that was the big dis--discussion, as to whether or not the public was, would accept them together now that they're, they're, you know, they're, they're no longer married.  You know, and they had all that controversy about their marriage and breakup and stuff like that.  And so and then they came back, it lasted about two--one and a half seasons I think.  We did about thirty-three shows.
Story_ID: 70306
Speaker 1: But for me, I, I really--see, the first time they were on television that was the first time that I really just split.  I wasn't--I said I'm not gonna get no further involved in this, 'cause that was in the late '60's [1960s].  I had stopped doing that stuff.  I was trying to move away, you know, trying to get back to my New Orleans stuff.  And I had brought--I had done--I had in '66 [1966] or '67 [1967], I--there was a No--cat from New Orleans came out there, Mac Rebennack [a.k.a. Dr. John], whom I had know as a young kid.  And while I was still doing Sonny and Cher stuff, I had mentioned to Sonny [Bono] that man, we ought to start a little production company and do some other people, 'cause "Sonny and Cher" is not gon' last.  You know, we ought to do some--start producing some other people.  So we did.  He, he formed a thing called Progress Records, which was a vehicle to produce other people.  So we, we did--he brought me in about two or three artists that were not of particular interest to me, but we did 'em.  Then he was sent on up to Atlantic, and that's who the deal was with and Harold Battiste Productions, and I didn't know that.  And the, the chick from At--Atlantic called me and told me.  She said you know, Harold, they're setting these production up here as Harold Battiste Production.
Speaker 2: It's like Internet.
Speaker 1: Yeah (laughter).  And I said wait a minute, man.  I mean I'm, I'm doing 'em, but this not my choice of--I'm just doing 'em 'cause that's what he want, Sonny want.  So I said well, if, if you're gonna do that, I'mma pick somebody I wanna do something.  And that's when I, I had, I had--Mac had come out there, as he's a guitarist and a piano player.  And he had been in a little trouble down in New Orleans [Louisiana], and he had been, done some time.  So he couldn't come back here, and he had to go somewhere else.  He couldn't come back here.  His probation wouldn't let him.  And his mama knew me, so she called me and let me know he was coming out there and to look out for him.  So I had started getting him little gigs around town, and I started taking him out on the road with Sonny and Cher as part of the rhythm section.  And I knew him.  He was a good songwriter.  I liked, you know, his songwriting.  So I asked him, in light of the fact that we had this production, you know.  I said man, is there anything that you, any ideas you got you wanna do, something you wanna do 'cause I'mma go ahead and produce something that I like?  And that's when he came--he told me about this Dr. John idea.  You know, he had been reading all this stuff about Dr. Dole voodoo cat Doctor John.  And he really, you know, he's a, he was a real student of--he'd learned about all that stuff, and he pitched that to me.  And I said I could see what it was.  I said yeah, man, that sound like something that ought to be hip to do.
Story_ID: 70307
Speaker 1: So we just, you know, I called the cats. I got all the New Orleans cats I could find out in Los Angeles, and, and, and booked some studio time.  And you know, I worked, you know, with him and finally organized it 'cause that was the only problem.  Mac [Mac Rebennack, a.k.a. Dr. John] didn't have real good organizational skills, and he also still had the, you know, drug problem, which made him not--you know, he never--you never could really rely on what he was gonna do.  So we started; we went in the studio and, and did this, this weird stuff; you know, we did this weird stuff (laughter).  And the funny thing is--'cause it was real funny to me to do that and create all of those real things.  And I said we--'cause that was during a period where they were going through this stuff about psychedelic stuff.  And they also had underground radio, you know, and that was all--I said now we gon' give 'em something, you know, to take underground.  We gon' (laughter)--and I had planned, I said you know, man, we can, we can even start selling those gris-gris stuff, you know, like they have at home, you know, that voodoo stuff.  These kids will go for it.  They go for--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--were, were you very familiar with any of that.  I mean growing up in New Orleans [Louisiana] were--
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, yeah, I mean I was--
Speaker 2: You were a nice church boy--
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I was--
Speaker 2: --but, but were you--
Speaker 1: You, you--it's, it's just in the nay--it's in the environment.  You know, I didn't really study it, but I knew, I knew about.  But, you know, the most I knew about--voodoo to me was when we used to wash our steps with red brick, you know, 'cause it's a do something.  And we had all kinds of little things we'd say, but I never really believed none of it.  But you know, but I knew the, knew the atmosphere and the--and I was doing it with a, with a sort of a tongue in cheek kind of attitude that this is designed to, to, to satisfy these people who were, you know, the hippies and the whatever they like that and peace, love and all that.  And--but so it came off pretty good.  He had all these little songs, you know, and little narratives about different things in the voodoo world.  He really had studied it.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And all I had to do was create a musical atmosphere that went with it.  He didn't wanna sing it though.  He, he--there was another cat was supposed to sing it named Ronnie Barron.  Ronnie was a good singer, and I thought Ronnie sang too good to do this kind of stuff.  So we finally convinced Mac to just, just talk it, man.  You don't have to sing, just, just talk, you know, this kind of stuff, you know.  So we did it.  And, and the funny thing, when, when we did it and I sent that up to Atlantic (laughter), and Ahmed (ph.) went bonkers there.  He said, "What are we gonna call this stuff?" (laughter), you know.  And he came out--was it him--yeah, he--either--yeah, I think it was him who came out to Los Angeles [California], you know, and we had meetings and stuff about what, what to call it.  What we gon' tell our promotion people if we put this out?  What we gon'--how they gon' know--this like a voodoo rock.  They just came up with all kind of silliness--swamp rock (laughter) and stuff to, to, to sell it.  So it almost took 'em, oh, man, a long time to, to release it. 'Cause I had wanted it to come out before Halloween that year, but it didn't, it didn't make that. Man, I forgot now what the timeframe was.  It took 'em a long time to put it out.  But I was doing all that while I was still halfway dealing with Sonny and Cher, you know, 'cause that's, that was my main job.  I was just doing Mac and you know, I didn't think that was gonna last.  I mean that was just a, a joke really.  And we was planning to have a little trinkets and stuff we could sell, you know, and maybe even have little voodoo shops, you know, to sell them some--get together dust and all that.  We had all that crazy stuff we was talking about in the record.
Story_ID: 70308
Speaker 1: But the critics liked it.  Man, when it came out, the critics--
Speaker 2: I, I know he got a lot of television time when they had the, the, the late night concerts on I think it was NBC or I, I guess was to--that he was on quite a bit.
Speaker 1: He--yeah, it turned out.  I mean it was--I, I was surprised, but then when I thought about it, it made sense.  'Cause the way he was presented--in fact, there was a couple of articles in "Life" magazine a cat named Goldman wrote.  He called the article "Miscegenation in Music."  When I saw that article I said oh, I said this is the way they're looking at this now, you know, 'cause they were, they were so happy.  I mean he actually said, after he described the music, he said but this is not some or something, something black person.  This is this white studio musician.  So that's a--was the angle, that he was a white boy, it was like doing this (unclear).  I know it sounds really, you know, like something not in black culture.  And in the whole article he never mentioned my name, you see, and I, and I didn't like that.  I mean, I mean it sort of, it made me see where they, where they gon' take this now, you know, and that, that they gonna glorify Mac [Mac Rebennack, a.k.a. Dr. John].  Well, they did.  Look how he's, he's living up in the Catskills or whatever that is up there--in the Hamptons.  You know, he's a talented cat.  He deserves all of it, but you know, I mean they, they made it be in, in, in my mind, in my mind it's, it's, it's another incident of how music that comes out of our community gets usurped and taken, taken down that road where it becomes American or at least not black; it's, it's--you know.
Story_ID: 70309
Speaker 1: Just briefly what, what is Congo Square?
Speaker 2: Congo Square is where, according to the history that I know, it used to be an Indian, Native American, sacred grounds.  When slavery was introduced, this being located just outside of the boundaries of New Orleans [Louisiana], it was a place where Africans could go to bring crafts and so forth to sell and trade on weekends, on Sundays whenever they were off, and of course sing and dance and do--be African, just to be African.  And, and of course that attracted the attention of a lot of Europeans who were here.  And it got to be a plus, the Congo, the Congo Square.  Sometime in the, in the, in the early part or the mid part of this century, it was changed to Beauregard Square for political or social reasons.  But the--
Speaker 1: (Unclear) That Confederate general, P. G. T. Beauregard.
Speaker 2: Yeah, General, General Gor--Beauregard (laughter), Beauregard; the name is funny to me.
Speaker 1: (Laughter)
Speaker 2: Anyway, but then, then it was changed, it was changed back to Congo Square in the last, maybe the last twenty years it's been changed back.  And it's been, be, beginning to be regarded--you know, it may, it may con--coincide with the recognition of, of the, the large number of African Americans that populate this city and because since the mid '80's [1980s] we've had black mayors.  Like a lot of cities, you know, we've had black mayors, so a lot of names are being changed, you know, the, the name of--there's a Mahalia Jackson's (unclear) thing there.  There's, well, Louis Armstrong Park now.  That whole park that Beauregard Square is now Louis Armstrong Park, and there's a statue of him there.  And Congo Square is aligned within that, so a lot of things have happened over the last twenty years of political change.
Story_ID: 70310
Speaker 1: I think we were gonna tell--you were gonna tell us about the Neville Brothers too (unclear).
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, well, I was--I think about the Nevilles.  I guess I've always known 'em; in fact, I recorded Art Neville, the oldest one, back when I was with Specialty [Records]at one of, one of his last hit records is one of the records I did with Art Neville.  And they were always separate I knew at that time.  Aaron Neville had recorded some things.  But since they came together as a group in the, must have been in the late '70's [1970s] or something, I mention them only in light of the fact that they have always had the New Orleans [Louisiana] population, always supported the music that they had created as the feeling of what New Orleans music is.  And artists like them have all taken a second seat now to Dr. John [Mac Rebennack], who has become the icon of New Orleans music.  Dr. John--there's another cat named James Booker.  You may never have heard of.  James Booker was the, a genius piano player, and he was brilliant piano player, who he was troubled.  He was a little troubled, but he was troubled I think mostly because he was in an environment that never could really get to where he was, you know, mentally and in his music.  He's a piano player, as I said before.  Dr. John, Harry Connick, Jr. all studied at the feet of James Booker.  If you ever hear James--okay, and there have been some radio documentaries--I heard a radio documentary done on James Booker--it's just amazing the, the vast array of styles that this cat played.  He got his most appreciation when he did a European latter part of his life.  Somebody got him to go over to Europe and play, and they said it was amazing because the people loved him so much they, they just went wild over him.  And after that tour James was, would be at his house, and he'd play a tape just to hear all that applause.  And he'd say, "they love me."  He, he, he didn't know he could be that well appreciated.
Story_ID: 70311
Speaker 1: But that's, when you hear Harry Connick, when Harry Connick first became popular--I saw him Los Angeles [California]--and he used to dedicate a, a state--a portion of his show to Booker [James Booker] and tell everybody where he, you know, (unclear) but that, that, that left his--that's not a part of his thing anymore I don't think.  But there's cats like Booker and Professor Longhair and cats like that who all have contributed to make Dr. John [Mac Rebennack] be Dr. John sort of get left in the dust.  In, in, in my mind, it reminds me of the scenario that made Elvis Presley put cats like Chuck Berry and all them in the dust, you know.  I mean he became the king, you know, and that's the way Dr. John is.  That's the way Benny Goodman became the, a king, you know.  Where, though, if you keep going back, you get back to what's this cat's name--Paul Whiteman.  You may not ever have heard him.
Speaker 2: (Unclear)--
Speaker 1: But he got to be the king of jazz.  Real quick they, they crown people kings of various kind of music.   That, that, that sort of still sort of bothers me that we haven't been able to--and now, the next king is gonna be Eminem.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) The king of rap, right?
Speaker 1: He gonna be the king of rap, yeah.  He might be already (laughter).
Speaker 2: I think he might be (laughter).
Story_ID: 70312
Speaker 1: What, what about, what about, since we're talking about New Orleans music, what about zydeco music?  I know I've heard of Queen Ida and Clifton Chanier and people like that.
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: What--
Speaker 2: --there's one guy that comes on the radio, if you talk to him and cat--I forget his name--French is his name--he, he is adamant about that, said that's not New Orleans music.  Zydeco is not New Orleans music.  That's south of the way Louisiana.  That, that's from around Lafayette and Cajun Coun--Country.  And I never knew what the difference between Cajun and zydeco, but it's just, I, I don't know what the real difference is, but it's not New Orleans music per se.  Although a lot of them have come to New Orleans now of course.  Just like there's no music that's necessarily a New York music, but a lot of people go to New York so that's what--so a, a lot of zydeco people are, are coming to New Orleans and they get, they--and it's very good music.  I enjoy it, man.  There's a place over here called Rock n' Bowl, and every Thursday night they have zydeco.  It's great music to dance to.  It feels very happy and everything.
Speaker 1: There's a group called the Mallet Playboys that always come to Chicago.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: From Mallet, Louisiana.
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, it's--but, you know, I, I just joke about when he say it's not New Orleans music.  This guy is really adamant about that.  But I accepted it, man.  Yeah, you, you bring it here, yeah, we'll take it, you know, you know, if--you know, New Orleans get room for all of that, all of it, you know.
Story_ID: 70313
Speaker 1: So what, what projects are you currently work, working on?
Speaker 2: Well, outside from--most of my stuff is focused on che--my work at the university, with the jazz program there.  So my focus is on a, a group of books that I've written called the Silver Books; they're music books that capture the music from the early--from the second half, what I call the second half of jazz, second fifty years of jazz in the, in New Orleans [Louisiana].  These are--this is music from James Black and Ellis Marsalis [Ellis Marsalis, Jr., HM] and Alvin Batiste, the young players who were playing modern jazz beginning in the second fifty years of jazz here.  Because that, during that period, jazz, modern jazz, really suffered here because this, the city had such a strong tradition of jazz in the traditional side (unclear).  So they really didn't need--they really wasn't looking for another kind of jazz.  They just, they was happy with what they had, so the young cats had a, had a tough time.  And many of, many of 'em, many of 'em or many of us left to go to other places where we thought we could be free to play the music.  But it, it--in my mind, and my, my focus now is to try to lift the perception of, of modern jazz, as it existed in New Orleans, so that we don't banish New Orleans to the past and say that this is New Orleans jazz, and that, and that would limit us to the first fifty years of jazz.  It knocks us out of the box, 'cause then people will think well, if you wanna hear modern jazz, you go--ain't no point in going there.  You could, you go to New York [New York City, New York] or you go to Chicago [Illinois] or somewhere other, Detroit [Michigan].  And I say lift the perception because I think at high levels we've accepted the fact that well, this is our jazz with--and it just, it, it, it it, it, it sort of puts--even with Wynton Marsalis, as much as, as world-class as he is, people don't necessarily associate him with New Orleans.  And hence, it's--I think it deprives New Orleans of the, of the, of the resource that it has when it cuts off.  And so even in our generation, I mean, they make a lot of about Ellis now, but Ellis was back here then, and all of us were playing jazz then.  So my job--(unclear) my job now is to, I'm trying to create a museum to, to exhibit all of New Orleans jazz, including the last fifty years of jazz and, and on into the future so that the people who, who create music here will not have to leave here, you know, if they don't--if they're not playing the traditional jazz that, that, that we can--and I, I, I--idealistically, I hadn't--like Terence Blanchard [HM] has bought a home here now.  He's live--he's back.  Branford [Marsalis] just moved to South Carolina somewhere.  But I want all of 'em to come back here.  And New Orleans needs to--and we need to pay tribute to these people, and we need the, the, the world to know that New Orleans is not just what the all know from Louis Armstrong, although Louis Armstrong deserves everything that they give him, but it didn't stop there.
Story_ID: 70314
Speaker 1: Now what are your hopes and concerns for the black community?
Speaker 2: Here or all over?
Speaker 1: Here, here and, and (unclear)--
Speaker 2: I--Maybe I shouldn't say this, and, and my mind is not big enough.  I, I don't know, I don't know enough of the political and economic ramifications of, of, of, of how that works to know how to solve it.  My idealistic hope is that we can lead the way to understanding that there are more things--we have more in common as human beings than we have than differences.  I, I think that the words get in the way of a lot of things that we as, as human beings deal with, just as it puts a barrier in the music by calling this jazz and calling this gospel and calling this different things.  And then you have to try to define what the differences are, when all of it is just music.  And without the name you probably would be more accepting, the same with the races.  So the black community is a, a victim of just being black or being called something different.  And looking, you begin to see the, you know, and, and so, as I say, I don't know specifically how to operate what to do about that.  I'm doing what I can do, and that's just in the music things, to uplift the music.  'Cause I think the music can stand, the music can stand on its own, no matter what you call it.

Speaker 1: Sir, what would you say at this juncture is, is your legacy?
Speaker 2: Well, I don't know.  I mean, I, I am, I'm, I think about that a lot now.  I think about that a lot.  I said what do I wanna leave here?  What do I wanna make sure stays here?  So, what I'm working on is, as I said, it's the music that we created, and the--and I'm incorporating it in a group of books.  Well, it will be one book when I'm finished called the Silver Books, will be a compilation of music that was created then.  And it's designed to be somewhat of a textbook or reference book for young jazz players to take this music on into the future.  And it's beginning to happen.  I might--yeah, I'm very happy that this just this year alone I'm beginning to hear the young students that we have over there in the practice rooms practicing this music.  The, the light is coming on in their minds, saying wow, this is some great music.  And they'll be--it'll be up to them to carry it on into the future.

Speaker 1: Did your parents [Harold and Pearl Battiste] get a chance to see you become a successful musician?
Speaker 2: My parents, that's one of my post--both of my parents died in 1957.  I was only twenty-six years old at the time, and, and--
Speaker 1: You were teaching then I guess, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, no, that was just after I had, that's after I had resigned (laughter) like they asked me, and I was working for Specialty Records at the time.  The last conversation I had with my father [Harold Battiste, Sr.] he told me on the phone, he said don't worry about coming back here, son.  If you see what you wanna do there, stay there and do it.  And I [clearing throat]--that was just right at the time when we was getting ready to go in the studio and do that "You Send Me."  [Clearing throat] And six months later my mother [Pearl Battiste] died, and she just was broken-hearted, you know.  She just--and that's--the, the, the, the--what I had seen in them all their lives, you know.  I mean I, I, I should have known that my mother was not gonna be able to stay here without him, 'cause they were, they were one.  And but it scared me to death, man.  I was scared, man, 'cause now I'm the only child, and they're gone, and I got a new wife and a kid.  Now what--you know.  And that has, in my subconscious, sort of been in the back of my mind all my life and now more than ever at this point in my life, you know.

Speaker 1: Tell us about your family.  Tell us about--
Speaker 2: My, my, my--
Speaker 1: --yeah.
Speaker 2: My family unfortunately at this point is not what I had dreamed it would be, because I didn't think I would be here by myself.  My wife decided to leave me in, in the '80's [1980s], '87' [1987] or something like that; she divorced me.  And that left me, that left me really with no, like they say, a ship without a rudder, 'cause I don't--I, I didn't know what I was gon'--I never had envisioned being alone at the latter part of my life.  I thought it was like my parents would be, you know, until death do we part, but it wasn't.  I have four children.  I have two daughters and two sons.  The, the, the sons are on, on the ends of, the oldest and the youngest, and, and the, the two daughters--
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA INTERRUPTION)
Story_ID: 70318
Speaker 1: No, but my children, I mean the two daughters are still in Los Angeles [California], and my youngest son, he just was here last week.  He came to visit me.  The youngest son's out there.  The oldest boy is here [New Orleans, Louisiana].  And they all okay.  They all satisfied with themselves.  I don't know if they, I don't know, I don't know psychologically where they are.  The youngest boy is the most, the most, if you wanna call it successful.  He's, he's been--he has the characteristics from a young kid that was suitable for today's world.  He's in computers.  He's a computer technician.  He's been in it about fifteen years now and you know, he's, he's doing okay.  I don't know about the others.  I don't know.  You know, they're still--they all got jobs.  They're all good people, but they, you know--I, I don't see them, them.  I don't know the future for them, you know.  And my wife, my former wife, she's doing okay too.  She's still, you know--the two girls still stay with her.  And my youngest daughter calls me almost every week.  She calls every, you know, and she's--they're, they're, they're, I think they're trying to deal with the fact that there is daddy, and we're gonna have to deal with daddy.  You know, sooner or later we're gonna have to deal with him, and we--and, and they, they, they're realizing my mortality now.  I mean they're realizing that hey, daddy--the--when the boys saw me, you know, now they see me and they see I can't walk too steadily.  I'm not as strong as I used to be, and I think it's dawning up on them that I'm not gonna be here forever.  So they're trying, they're, they're trying ways to try to connect.  It's one of those kind of things, you know, see how it works.
Story_ID: 70319
Speaker 1: Tell me--this is slightly different from the other question, but what--how, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: Well, well, I guess by, you know, I just, I'd like my children to, to, to know me.  I've written a series of books.  I've got about five volumes of books that I call "The Scriptures of Harold Who," that they were written for my children.  And in the opening of books up said that these books primarily are for, for keys that to unlock doors that my children may someday wanna unlock those--in those books that I, I made 'em, they're here, and they can maybe get to know me.  That's the most important thing to me, is to be remembered by my children, even as, as, as a lot of people that I know now seem to, you know, deal with me now.  I mean (unclear) have friends and so forth and people in the world that seem to think a lot more of me than I--maybe my children don't know me, and maybe that's the way it is.  You know, I, I--
Speaker 1: That happens to a lot of people I guess.
Speaker 2: A lot of people that--and, and lots of my thoughts are say--you know, how come is it my children don't seem to know me and everybody else seems to--(unclear)--you find all of that stuff on the Internet.  Maybe I ought to some (unclear) look, look on the Internet you can find (laughter)--I don't know.  I just can't--it's a puzzle, 'cause that's--everything I ever did was directed toward my family.  My, my, my decisions to do Sonny and Cher was not what I wanted to do, but it was gonna pay to get them a house and get them whatever, you know, that--all my decisions in my life were made not considering what I wanted to do, but what could I do, you know.  And so that's, that's, that's the most important thing to me.  That's why you see all these pictures around my house with the family and with, with them hanging around, 'cause that's, that's what the last--the last fifteen years have been, a surprise to me because I didn't think I'd live this long.  I, I had, I had myself pegged for sixty as a terminal point because my father was fifty-seven when he died, and my mother was fifty-five.  And I have all of the physical problems that they had that took 'em out.  So I never thought I'd, you know, live and live this long.
Story_ID: 70320
Speaker 1: Tell, tell me this: What advice would you give your children and other young people at, at this juncture, and what's the message if you could boil down something, something message, you know, what would you, what you--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Well, I mean the way we talking about, I mean the things comes to my mind now, of course, is, is, is that I'mma, I'mma an elder now.  And I realize I guess that most of the important things are, are--reside in the people who've lived long enough.  And the fact if young people, I think young people that get hip to that early, they can get some keys to life that will sustain them.  They can really learn that hey, there's an old person there.  Let me see what that person's got to say, and then extract out of it some things.  I mean I--I mean that's what has sustained me, you know.  I'm not a religious person.  I mean I don't--but I read the Bible because I think of the wisdom that is in there about people who had lived, and they wrote stories.  So wherever I can find some guidelines for people, our people who are older than me, that's why I listen to my adopted brother.  Now he calls me every morning.  He's about three or four years older than me, and I consider him my elder.  And he's not educated not nearly as well as I'm, not at all hardly.  I mean he, you know, he dropped out of school when he was in elementary school.  But when I really listen to him, there are things that he--so that's what I would say to young people now, you know.
Speaker 1: To listen?
Speaker 2: Listen to--listen.
Speaker 1: Thank you so much.  This has been--
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: --of great value to us.
Speaker 2: Thank you, man.
Speaker 1: Thank you.
Speaker 2: Thank you all for doing this, all right.

I, I never saw him dressed like that when I was alive. So he--this must have been the way he dressed to capture my mother.
Speaker 2: This is a picture of my mother and father, Pearl Booker Battiste and Harold R. Battiste, when they were--we all were on vacation.  This was about 1940 or '41' [1941] in a place called Waveland, Mississippi.

Speaker 2: And this picture is how do you think?

This was an exhibit that was put up representing Harlem [New York City, New York].  If you'll see pictures of the Cotton Club, that's not the real Cotton Club.  That is merely an exhibit that was put up by this Black Music Hall of Fame org--organization.  I'm, I'm standing third from the right, the man with the beard.
Speaker 2: Oh, this is me, a photographic portrait done by (unclear) photographer.  I forgot his name--Dennis.

Speaker 2: This was done in I think '91' [1991].
Speaker 1: This was when I made the cover of this magazine.  It's a black-owned magazine by a guy named Sydney Miller, and this is about the fourth or fifth issue of the thing back in the '70's [1970s].  I forget exactly what year it was, '75' [1975] or '76' [1976].  Yes, it was then because I was doing a television show, the "Sonny and Cher" show.  And he wanted to do a cover story on me.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA MALE VOICE):  November 15, 1976.
