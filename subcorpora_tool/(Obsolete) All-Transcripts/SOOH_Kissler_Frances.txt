 Larson  Okay, today is April 8, 2011. My name is Mary Larson, and I   m here  with Ms. Frances Kissler in Clinton, Oklahoma. We   re doing this project  as part of the Spotlighting Oklahoma project but a particular section on  the Germans from Russia in Oklahoma. Ms. Kissler, could you start by  telling me your full name and when and where you were born?  Frances Rachel Kissler. I was born in Washita County, just a mile south  of the Custer County line on the homeplace as we called it. That was on  January 9, 1923.  What were your parents    names?  My father was Reuben H. Kissler. The H was from his father   s name,  Henry. My mother   s name was Rachel Rosenoff.  When and where were they born?  Papa was born in  Beatrice,  Nebraska on February 11, 1896. My mother  was born in Washita County on August 22, 1903.  How many brothers and sisters do you have?  I have two brothers and one sister, and the youngest brother died in an  accident at nine years old. VerNell, my sister, died just last month,  February 27.  What   s your brother   s name?  Calvin Reuben  Kissler .  Calvin Reuben. Named after your dad just like you have your middle  name after your mom. Okay. Were they all born in Oklahoma  at home ,  5  Kissler  Larson  Kissler  Larson  Kissler  Larson  Kissler  Larson  Kissler  Larson  Kissler  Larson  Kissler  Larson  Kissler  Larson  Kissler  all your brothers and sisters?  Yes, except VerNell. She was born in Weatherford at the hospital  because my mother had an infection in her leg when she was   so she  had to be born there.  So the others were born out on the homeplace?  Yes, on the homeplace.  Were both your mother and father   s sides of the family Germans from  Russia?  Yes.  Okay. I   m going to ask you similar sets of questions for both sides of the  family. Which side do you want to start with, your mom   s or your dad   s?  My dad   s.  Okay. Do you know when his family left Germany for Russia?  Germany to Russia. That   s that story where you   ve heard many times,  I   m sure, about Catherine the Great, so that is the time that they left. I  don   t know how many generations lived in Russia, but I think five. I   ve  got it at home, but I don   t have it here.  Do you know where did they end up when they were in Russia?  It was a commune, and that was along the Volga River as I understand.  Do you know the name of the community?  No.  Did your family stay in that area the whole time they were there in  Russia?  I think they did.  And was the village entirely German?  As I understand, it was a commune that they all lived in the same area,  and the women and children stayed there during the week, and the men  went out and worked and would come home only on Sunday.  6  Larson  Kissler  Larson  Kissler  Larson  Kissler  Larson  Kissler  Larson  Kissler  Larson  Kissler  Larson  Kissler  Were they working as farmers in other areas?  Yes. Yes.  Do you know when they left Russia, when your father   s family left  Russia?  During the latter part of, not 1800, but within those twenty years there  because they were here 1885, I believe. I forgot to look at my  grandmother   s because   let me see. I read that, but now I can   t think  what it is. I don   t remember.  The exact date isn   t important. Do you know why they left when they  did?  Well, there was a change in the government. The Bolsheviks hadn   t  taken over there yet, because I heard those stories from the people who  came to our church and told us the horror stories about when they were  there. Our people didn   t experience that, so they were fortunate to come  out when they did.  Did your whole family come over at the same time?  We   re talking about my father   s?  On your father   s side.  The way I understand, they did, and they had five children and his wife.  They were in Nebraska, and he was working on the railroads then. He  came home one day, and his wife was terribly sick. She died. He was left  with five children. Of course, they married within their group. The  widow Repp had three children, two girls and a boy. He married her.  Anyway, that was Repp and Kissler. Yes, okay. So when they were  married, they had three more boys. They had three boys together. One is  my dad. One is his brother, Uncle Ben, who was a minister. The other  one, he didn   t live, Abraham. He didn   t live.  Do you know, did the family come over just by themselves to Nebraska,  or did they come over with other folks from the same community in  Russia?  That I do not know, and I don   t have any pictures or anything of them.  Do you know where they were in Nebraska?  Well, they must have been in Hastings, because that   s where we went  7  Larson  Kissler  Larson  Kissler  Larson  Kissler  Larson  Kissler  Larson  Kissler  Larson  Kissler  Larson  Kissler  Larson  Kissler  back to visit.  Do you still have relatives up there?  Well, they   re now distant relatives that I don   t keep up with. I remember  that I was seven years old when I got to go there. I remember the  ballpark. There   s just certain things that I remember about it. I went  again when I was grown. It was in the    60s, I believe. I just was amazed  how certain things stayed in my mind then.  It   s funny what you remember.  I know.  Did you get to see the house where he had grown up or anything like  that?  No, because I don   t think they were there very long at all. I get my  families mixed up, the Rosenoffs and the Kisslers. I met both, and the  one on the Rosenoffs   well, I   ll tell that in the Rosenoffs.  So you said your father was born in 1896. When did they come to  Oklahoma?  It was real close to 1900.  Okay. So your dad still would   ve been very little.  Young.  Were they farmers up in Nebraska?  Well, I think he worked for a Mr. Fotha Kissler. We couldn   t say     Fotha    in German like we were supposed to. Do you speak German?  Just a little bit.  Okay, so you know that I can   t say    father    correctly in German, so the  kids, when we called him    Fotha,    it stayed with it. The way we spelled  it was F-O-T-H-A, and I don   t know if that   s correct or not.  They came to Oklahoma, you said, around 1900. Where did they move  when they came here?  They came down here to that homeplace. He had a man from their  community. Hamburger was his name. It   s not the Hamburgers, Laverne  8  Larson  Kissler  Larson  Kissler  Larson  Kissler  Larson  Kissler  Larson  Kissler  Larson  that   s here today. It   s some kind of cousin, the way I understand. He put  a down payment on that place until he could get down here. The way I  understand is that Motha, Grandmother, and her family came down by  train then. I guess they didn   t have it as hard as I thought they did.  (Laughs)  So they didn   t come down in one of the land runs, but they had friends  here from the community that put a down payment for them.  That   s right. It just seems so interesting to me to hear the ones were here  ahead of them that could put the down payment or could make the run. I  just couldn   t imagine that, not our people.  With the folks that were down here ahead of time, you said they were  from the same community. Was it the same community in Nebraska, or  the same community from Russia?  Both.  Both, okay. So in Nebraska, they all lived in the same general area?  And there was a line to see the railroads. There was a lot of work there.  Fotha, Grandpa Kissler, he saved enough money that he could get that  farm, then he could get each child a farm. That   s a hundred and sixty  acres, and then we   d get eighty for them, also. You know how that goes.  So they were on the old homeplace there, or what became the  homeplace, just south of the Custer County line?  Yes.  How many families do you think were in the general area that used to be  in the same community back in Russia? Do you have any idea?  I know of twelve at least. They were meeting in the granary that we had  there on the farm. They built a church, and this was just like a   I saw  them back east more than I see them here. Looks like a two-room house.  And the schools look the same. The schools look the same to me. That   s  what they built on the Adler place across the road, south. On the  homeplace, it   s a cemetery, Zion Cemetery. They quit burying them  there in World War II. My dad told my aunt,    Don   t bury Henry there  because there   s not going to be anybody to take care of it.    Here all  these years later, it   s still being taken care of real good. It   s called Zion  Cemetery.  Okay, so we were talking about the fact that they had     9  Kissler  Larson  Kissler  Larson  Kissler  Larson  Kissler  Larson  Kissler  Larson  Kissler  Built this church and also the cemetery, and my great-grandparents were  the first ones buried there. Valentine and his wife Adler. I don   t know if  he died there or if they just put his name on the tombstone. I don   t think  he was the first one because his daughter, about two down, there on the  right, on the first row of the deals. Now a lot of them have been moved  to other cemeteries, like my little brother   s moved to ours in  Weatherford Greenwood Cemetery.  So you mentioned that they built a church.  And the cemetery was built at the same time on one corner, and the  church the other. When we had funerals, they would have the little girls  to come up ahead of the casket and carry the flowers, and then have the  body carried, and then the mourners behind it, walk right across the  street. Since we   re in Weatherford, that   s what they have done a couple  of times with some of the people who are buried there, where they can  walk across from there. We couldn   t do it for VerNell. It was on across  there. I wasn   t there, but they   ve told me about it.  What was the name of the church?  Zion.  Just like the cemetery.  Zion German Congregational Church.  Later was  Zion Congregational  Church.  Okay and was that Lutheran?  Well, a lot of them were Lutherans when they were over, but it was  really more an independent church. We had a church in Manitou down  near Lawton, and one at Shattuck, one at Follett, Texas, one at Fargo,  Oklahoma. We tried to have one at Clinton. It didn   t work, so the few  that were there came to our church a few times. I only met a family of  them. I don   t remember hardly anybody from there. Then we had some  other people buried in our cemetery that weren   t from our church, but  they were from the community.  So were most of the folks from this community in Russia the same  denomination, essentially?  The way I understand, there were more Lutherans when they were there.  I never did see a picture or anything from them, from there. When they  came over, I don   t think they brought any pictures, but I know my uncle  10  Larson  Kissler  Larson  Kissler  Larson  Kissler  Larson  Kissler  Larson  Kissler  and aunt, they had a picture of their family that was just beautiful. He  was in the Prussian army. See, that   s really during that bad time when  they came over here. When they got to our church, the first Sunday,  Aunt Adelia said her mother wore her hat. She looked around, and she  was the only one with a hat on. They all had a babushka on and had let  their hair go. All had long hair, so it was different for them.  Is the church still out there?  No, that   s the one that we go to on Daniel. It   s up by the cemetery now.  It   s called Zion. It   s really Evangelical Free Church, but this minister we  have, he wants it only as Zion Church, so that   s what we   re doing.  And that   s basically what   s developed from the church that was there  when you were     It   s amazing how there   s so few of us left. I   m one of the oldest ones,  see. Like Geraldine and Ezra, there on your left today, he is just a little  bit older than I am. He   s ninety-one or -two, and then she   s about eighty  or so. I don   t think she   s eighty yet. I don   t know how old she is. Their  daughter is Deb. You met her, I think.  Yes, she was at the far end of the table between Latasha and Tanya. So  how long was that church there? Do you remember?  Well, 1903 is the beginning, and then the twenty-fifth anniversary,  we   ve seen a picture of it. They hadn   t added on, then, yet. They were  all having lots of children, so that place was packed out all the time. The  first time they built out, they built out to the left from the front, and then  the second time to the right, and that   s when I was there. Fiftieth. I  remember that so well. Oh, we were so proud of it. We had this man  who came over in    30, Steiner from Switzerland. He learned his trade  over there. He could paint just beautifully. The first time I saw it in that  big high ceiling that was gray down to the wainscot, and then those little  boards like this     Oh, wainscoting?  From this part down.  Right, from about the chair rail down you have the strips of wood.  That   s right. Anyway, I remember that real light gray was just beautiful  and that brown, more brown here. Then the benches, there were no pads  or anything, just benches. I can   t remember if we had that before or not.  I just can   t remember. They had a crying room back there for the babies  11  Larson  Kissler  Larson  Kissler  Larson  Kissler  Larson  Kissler  Larson  Kissler  and mamas. They had a basement under that because I remember one  time that they had a dinner, and I was there.  How long was the church there before they moved to the one     When they opened I-40, we knew our attendance was going down, so  they said within two weeks, if you wanted to move, you had to move  then. They got it moved before the highway closed. We couldn   t do it,  and moved it on that lot. I   m so glad. We   re so thankful that they did  because it   s a real good location. We knew the people that they bought it  from. That was a positive for it.  So it   s the same church. It   s just in a different location.  No, that church is actually where we moved it on the corner of Daniel  and Huber, and we sold them that church and that lot. It was first to the  Episcopalians. They wanted to move in right away, and we didn   t have  our church built up on the hill. The first thing finished was the, well,  where you have entertainment.  Oh, like the community hall area?  Ok. That was finished. From home, we all brought in folding chairs and  we met in that fellowship hall. Well, it had a cement floor, and the  sound, you couldn   t hear anything. That   s where we worshipped for  quite a while. When we got into the main part, the main sanctuary, we  loved it. That was during the oil boom here in    80, so we got our church  paid for real quickly. We had real generous people. Like our parlor, one  of the ladies did it, and just recently she told me that she got that money  from her grandmother. That   s why she did it. She wanted it to go to a  good place. Her grandmother was down near Lawton. I thought that was  a good   she   s Martha that has The Klosett now, and Geraldine   s  daughter-in-law. That   s the way it just seemed like there were so many  things that just appeared that people would give. It was great.  Now, let   s talk a little bit about your mother   s family.  Okay.  We   ll start in with some of the same questions, but do you know, did they  leave Germany for Russia at about the same time, during the era of  Catherine the Great, or did they go at a different time? Do you know?  Her mother   s mother was much like this, what I   ve said about my  father   s. But her father   s was Rosenoff, and they said that was Rosenaur  in German. Foddy   there again, the oldest grandson couldn   t say  12  Larson  Kissler  Larson  Kissler  Larson  Kissler  Larson  Kissler  Larson  Kissler  Larson  Kissler  Larson  Kissler     father,    so he said    Foddy,    and that stuck all his life. Anyway, he was  going to have to go to the service. He was eighteen, nineteen years old.  His girlfriend was one of the Adler girls. When he had enough money to  go over in just a few years, he got over there, and she   d married  somebody else. But Molly, (the one that looked like VerNell, he said)  she   d grown up. That   s who he married when she was eighteen or  nineteen. He came over, not to see his mother and daddy again, but did  see his sister when she was older, that lived in Washington or Oregon,  and he went there to see her. I just don   t know how people could live  like they did.  So he stayed over there.  He came over. My grandfather came over but left all his family over  there. And my dad   s father, he came over, too. My Fotha and Motha     no, that   s a different wife. The first wife had five children. She died, and  his father   s wife died. Does that make sense?  Yes.  Okay, so he said,    I   m not going to start over here in America. I   m going  back home.     Ah, so he went back.  He went back home.  Did he go back to Russia or to Germany?  To Russia.  And what year was that?  Oh, this is all in the 1890s.  So some people did go back.  He did. He   s the only one I know that did go back, from our people, I  mean. I forgot to tell you that, a while ago.  Now, with your mother   s side of the family   first of all, where in Russia  was your mother   s family? Same area?  Yes, because I remember Grandma telling about the wonderful  strawberries that they had in the spring.  13  Larson  Kissler  Larson  Kissler  Larson  Kissler  Larson  Kissler  Larson  Kissler  Larson  Kissler  Since we   re talking about strawberries, do you want to talk about the  strawberry   what was it? The strawberry dish you were talking about.  Oh, that   s strawberry maldasha  maultaschen . Now, I don   t know what  that means at all, but the way that we made it, it was very simple. You  take your yinger, that   s the noodle dough cut like that. It   s thin, but it   s  cut about like that size.  A little rectangle of dough.  What we do now, to save time and everything, is the yinger noodles. Just  break them. Anyway, you boil them in salted water and then you drain  them, keep them warm. Take a big skillet and melt your butter until it   s  nice and brown, and you brown your croutons, from homemade bread is  the best.  About how big would those have been?  Not very big, like little squares. Then, after you take them out on paper  towels   we used to put them on a tea towel, but now you put them on  paper towels. In that butter, what   s left in the bottom, you put sour  cream. How   s that sound? Saliva   s running.  (Laughs) I know. It sounds good, and I   m still full from lunch.  Anyway, we served soup bowls with that, and we used to have it as a  meal because it   s so filling. Then we had this nice big bowl of  Oklahoma strawberries, sliced with sugar on them. What else. I think  that   s all. There   s just a few things in it. You put the yinger in first, and  then you put a little bit of sour cream, then your strawberries, then your  croutons on top. It looks pretty, too. It really does. Even though Zane,  my brother-in-law, he didn   t like them. I remember when I   d come  home, he would be going someplace else for lunch, because VerNell and  the boys were having those at home.  I   m sorry, I didn   t mean to get us off the track, but you had told that  strawberry story at lunch, and I thought we needed to get that down.  (Laughter) So with your mother   s family, do you know about when they  came over from Russia, most of them?  I know that her mother   s people came over ahead of Kisslers.  And her mother     Was an Adler.  14  Larson  Kissler  Larson  Kissler  Larson  Kissler  Larson  Kissler  Larson  Kissler  Larson  Kissler  Larson  Kissler  Larson  Kissler  Larson  Adler, okay. So they got here early 1880s, maybe?  Yes.  Okay.  Because Valentine Adler   well, by then, (that   s    03 when church was  formed) the Kisslers were in the lineup, too, Fotha and Motha. Not my  dad and mother, but their parents.  And did they come to about the same area in Nebraska, do you think?  Yes. When they knew one another, it   s just like me when I went to  Washington. I went with the ones from school.  Right, you want to be with the folks you know.  Sure.  So they came to Nebraska first and then came down to Oklahoma. Do  you know when about they came to Oklahoma?  Well, they came ahead of the Kisslers, I know that.  Oh, that   s right. Did they come over from Russia ahead of the Kisslers  or just down to Oklahoma?  Ahead.  Okay, so they may have been part of the advanced guard that came  down and helped people get land.  Yes. See, like that Adler, they had the farm across there, and the next  mile, this Hamburger had that as his homeplace, and he put the down  payment for this one a mile north, just a mile north of where he was. I  guess his boys were still young enough that he wasn   t thinking ahead  like he should, but he still got each one of them a farm.  Okay, so your mother   s family got down here ahead of the Kisslers, and  they were part of the same church?  Yes, definitely.  Do you remember any stories that they had about when they first got  down here, either on your mother   s side or your father   s side?  15  Kissler  Larson  Kissler  Larson  Kissler  Larson  Kissler  Larson  Kissler  Larson  Kissler  Larson  Kissler  Larson  Kissler  Larson  I don   t remember that I do have. You know, I have a book on the church  history, and I wonder if I could give that to you. You would want to read  it?  Maybe we could make a copy, if that would be okay?  Of something out of it? Okay, because my first one is the one that  Geraldine did in 1980 when we got this new church. We had these two  ladies who agreed to translate it from the German script, so we have that,  but I definitely would want it back because it   s the only one I have. The  next one, it   s all apart because I   ve used it to fill in what I   ve learned,  which I shouldn   t do, but I did. How will I get that to you?  We   ll figure that out. Thank you. Now, I   d ask how your parents met, but  since they seem to be in the same church in the same town    (Laughs)  You bet.  Is there a story about how they first started to go together?  The young people would go out on outings and all, and I know that  there   s one picture that shows my dad and my mother, not together, but  they were in this picture. One of these ladies gave it to me because my  mother and dad didn   t have a picture of that. I just loved it, because I  could tell by their ages that that was close to their wedding.  What year did they get married?  Twenty-one.  What did your family do for work, on both sides, when they first came to  Oklahoma?  Farming always.  Was it a mix of wheat and cattle, or     It was really wheat, most that I can remember.  Did they have that winter wheat, too? Did they used to plant winter  wheat, because I heard it was some of the Germans from Russia that  introduced that?  Yes, I think that   s what it is.  Okay.  16  Kissler  Larson  Kissler  Larson  Kissler  Larson  Kissler  Larson  Kissler  I wish Calvin could answer these questions, my brother. He still farms,  eighty-seven years old.  Oh, bless his heart.  Barbara, you met her a while ago. That   s her husband. She wasn   t raised  in our community, but, boy, everybody loves her. She has a personality  that you would.  So over the generations, it sounds like your brother continued in  farming.  Oh, yes. He still is. He won   t turn it over to his son, so his son went  home yesterday to Chicago. He   ll be back in two months.  How old is his son now?  Fifty-two. He didn   t have any children with  his  first wife, but this one,  he has a boy and a girl. She is four and he will be two in August. They  are wonderful. I loved his first wife. She was in the family twenty years,  but she was just that much ahead of me, and I don   t like that.  I know that I was going to ask what you   ve done over the years. I  happen to know that in 1942, you and some friends went off to  Washington, DC, was it, to find work during the war?  That   s right. I was in school here at Southwestern  Oklahoma State  University . Every one of the boys was leaving. Every day there was  less. Especially Mr. Guffee, I just loved him, in the business department.  Everything I had was business: bookkeeping, accounting, which took all  my time, typing, which I shouldn   t have had because I had a good one in  high school, and shorthand. You don   t use it anymore. Anyway, those  were real important. Mr. Guffee said,    The civil service people are going  to be here to interview you people. If you are interested, you take this  civil service test, and if they have an opening, they will send you a  notice or call you.    They called me one day and said that I had it. The  next day,    Oh, that was a mistake. You didn   t have it.    I was just  floored.  Well, the next two or three days, they called again.    That was a  mistake.    They wanted me up there on July 16. Well, boy, I didn   t have  hardly any time to get ready to go. I didn   t have hardly anything to pack,  anyway, because I had one little suitcase when I left home. When I knew  that I had it, already there were some up there from our church and from  school, of course, and then also from the business college here in  17  Larson  Kissler  Clinton, so I knew that I would have a contact there. I told my mother  and dad.    Oh, yes.    They   d take me. Well, I   ll never forget that  morning, Calvin and VerNell. VerNell, she was just a ten-year-old kid,  and Calvin, he   s a year and nine months younger than me, but he seemed  much younger, always. They went with us. We got to Weatherford, and  they bought me a new wristwatch. They didn   t have the money when I  graduated, so now they gave me a wristwatch. For my graduation, they  gave me a locket, which I still have, and have Calvin and VerNell   s  pictures in it from that time.  Aww, that   s so sweet.  Yes. I just love it. I wouldn   t take anything for it. Anyway, when we got  to the city, Calvin, he had to have a new saddle. That   s right. He had to  have a new saddle. We went back home, got his saddle, put it in the  trunk, went over back in town, got him a new saddle, and then we went  to the train station. There was gobs of people there. I didn   t know the  first thing about what to do. Calvin, he always knew everything, so he  was telling me what to do. I got on the train, and it was freezing cold in  there. I had on summer clothes, no sweater or anything. I was so  miserable. Anyway, this young soldier sits down beside me, and VerNell  was out there, jumping up and down, waving goodbye.  I   ve got to tell you this about that night when they got home. Uncle  George and Aunt Marie, Floyd, and Eloise, they came over. That   s my  mother   s sister. VerNell told Uncle George,    She   ll be all right. There   s  soldiers that sat by her.    (Laughs) She was so ornery. She was a precious  girl. He said,    What are you going to do about dinner? You   ve got to  eat.    I said,    I   m not hungry.    I wouldn   t budge from that seat, and I  didn   t want him to know how cold I was or anything. Made it through  the night somehow. I know I went to the ladies    room because it was  warmer in there, and I went there a lot of times. The next morning, got  off, and we were in St. Louis. They had a booth where you could pay a  quarter and get in there and take sponge baths. That   s what I did.  So when I went back out, it was an hour or so before that train would  pull out. I got on there with my suitcase and put it up there. Here comes  a girl. She looked just as green as I did. I sat here, and we talked all the  way to Washington. When we got to Washington, we went to see about  our bags. They   re not here yet. We stepped out on the esplanade. You  know that esplanade whenever you come out of that train station. I   m  telling you, this was 1942, and I stepped out there.    Oh, look at the  Capitol.    We both just took off, and we walked all the way around that  and came back. We then got our  things , and so I said goodbye, and she  said goodbye. We didn   t even exchange names or anything. I just wasn   t  thinking ahead. I had Cordelia   s phone number in my pocket. That   s the  18  only thing I was worried about, that I needed to get in touch with her. I  called her, and she said,    Will you go to the Y because I don   t know if  we have a room for you right now.    So I got in the taxi, and I said,    The  Y,    and he said,    Which one?    (Laughs) Oh, that was awful. He took me  to the closest one, which was just fine.  When I walked in there, there was this big room that had three beds and  this one girl, German accent. She was from Germany and just two years  ahead. They had the map out on the table, trying to figure out where we  were going to work. She said,    You can walk to yours.    When I got out  there, you walked across the  National  Mall. I got there, and I said,    I   m  Frances Kissler.       Oh, where have you been? We   ve looked for you all  day long.    I said,    Well, I   m not going to start out wrong. I   m going to  tell you what happened. I saw the Capitol, and we walked all the way  around it.    This is four o   clock. She said,    Well, that   s the kind of  person we want. Where are you staying?    I said,    The Y.       Well, you go  back and rest a good night   s sleep, and be back here tomorrow  morning.    So that   s what I did. I started off on the wrong foot, really.  (Laughs) For anybody else, it would   ve been the wrong foot, but this  was just great.  I stayed there two nights, I think. This is down Pennsylvania,  Nineteenth. That first block was all row houses. All up in that area was  row houses on that street, now. Well, they had rooms. You   d be three in  a room. Laverne will tell you. She knows how many took to the  bathroom. I don   t remember that. Anyway, Laverne came up just a  month later than I did, I think. We stayed in the same place, she, Eloise,  and I. That was for I don   t know how many months. Then Cordelia, she  was the one who could get things done. She rented an apartment and  bought the furniture. Then we paid Cordelia the rent. Did that for a  couple years. The work that I did was   I didn   t want to do typing  because I had seen typing pools, and I didn   t like the ideas of those at  all, so I did bookkeeping by hand. We kept track of the steel that was  allotted to companies, because that was war time and that was real  important.  One day this friend of mine came after lunch.    Oh, Frances, I should  have come and gotten you. We had three people in our office from your  town.    I said,    What for?    She said,    They have pilot training, and they  were getting steel that they could build.    You couldn   t build anything  during the wartime and all that, but for wartime you could. These young  men were in pilot training. Later, I was here in NARFE, National  Association for Retired Federal Employees, and this one lady that I just  couldn   t hardly stand, (she wasn   t one of our people, either) she taught  in that school, taught that flying. I couldn   t keep from admiring her a  little bit.  19  Larson  Kissler  Larson  Kissler  Now, you mentioned Cordelia and Eloise. What were their last names?  Cordelia was Eckhardt, and Eloise was Hamburger. She was some kind  of kin to Laverne that   s here today, Taylor. I think their dads might   ve  been cousins or second cousins. I don   t know. I never could get that  straight. I knew Eloise   s father and her grandparent Hamburger, but not  the others. They didn   t speak English, just like my Kisslers didn   t speak  English. Well, Fotha, Grandpa did, real broken. It was real funny.  How long did you stay in Washington?  I was there just three years, and I was only there six months when my  grandmother died. Sixty-five years old. Boy, I got on that next train. I  told them. They said,    Oh, yes, but will you come back?    is what they  said. I said,    Yes, I   ll come back.    When I got home, I thought,    Should  I stay here or not?    My friend was working at the bank, and she thought  I should stay home. Another cousin was here, but she worked in a caf  ,  and I never worked in a caf  . I was raised on a farm, and I used to have  to help my mother in the summertime. There was no working away from  home then. I was home almost two weeks, and I went back. I told my  mother, I said,    I love it up there, but I will not live up there.    Every  weekend, we went out to visit and see what was there. I loved it. You  could go anywhere, and it was safe. You could walk on a main street at  night, all downtown, and it was safe.  They changed so much, it was just pathetic. I hate to see that. Mrs.  Roosevelt, she was in the White House there. One day, I missed being  on the same trolley she was on because they said she was on the next  one. She said she   d been in the slum area, and she got that cleaned up.  When I was there the last time, I asked my brother-in-law, Zane, to drive  down Georgia Avenue. We were on Georgia Avenue, right there by the  Walter Reed Hospital. He went down there, and it was five o   clock in  the afternoon, and these negroes had this pipe crossing the street ahead  of you. You don   t dare hit me, you know? Then drinking out of a paper  sack with a bottle in it, crossing the street. It was awful. We were on our  way down to the wharves where you get the fish. When we left there that  night, I said,    Oh, would you mind driving around the Washington  Monument? I want to see what it looks like tonight.    The traffic was  bumper to bumper. It was terrible. Zane, he was so disgusted with me,  he didn   t know what to do. (Laughter) He   s got the patience of Job, I  think.  I did love it, and it was for a good reason that I was there. When I came  back home, (I   ve loved Oklahoma City, always) I thought,    I   m going to  go see       Well, there was an Adler girl there from Indiahoma. She took  20  Larson  Kissler  me under her wing. She said,    I know this town. I know where I want  you to get a room.    Well, it was just down the street from where she and  her sisters were, in the principal of Central High School and their home  was on Seventeenth and   what   s that north-and-south street there by the  veterans hospital and Oklahoma medical research?  Oh, Classen? No, no, no that   s     It   s on east. Lincoln Boulevard, and then what? Anyway, that street.  They had the master bedroom, was two beds and a bathroom. Those four  girls lived there. That was just ideal. Sisters, you know. They were from  down Chattanooga or Manitou, and had lived on a farm. These two were  marrying brothers. Well, she didn   t marry then, but she married later,  and the other one never did marry. The one that was an organist for, oh,  what is that called? Saturday nights for youth for Christ. This lady that  had the mason jars, she sponsored her to go to different places to play.  She was a real good pianist. I loved Oklahoma City from the minute I  went there. I thought,    My gosh, Frances, you don   t have a job.    So I  went to the employment office, and she said,    Well, what do you think  you want to do?    I said,    I   d sort of like to work in town. I don   t want to  go out to the plant.    She said,    Okay,    and I went to the employment  office of   what was out at Tinker Field? I can   t think right now what it  was, but that   s where I went there to apply for that job. It   s where the  Boulevard Cafeteria is to this day. They said,    No, we want you here.    I  said,    That   s just great.     The girl that interviewed me turned out to be a real good friend of mine.  She says,    Well, you did sixty-five words with two errors.    I said,     That   s not any good.    She said,    Yes, it is good     (Laughs) So anyway,  she wanted me. She just died last year or so. I saw her picture in the  Daily Oklahoman, and I called her husband to be sure. It seems like  most of my friends have died. There   s so few left. I have friends here at  Weatherford now, but they   re younger. There   s nobody as old as I am.  I am so glad I came back to Weatherford because it is so easy to get  around. Just recently someone had called Health Watch and thought  maybe they should check on me. They came. Well, of course, they were  wanting to do it. The one lived three doors north of me. She called me  last week or so and said,    Are you doing all right?    I said,    Yes, I   m  doing just fine.    Also, my doctor   s office called.    Did we talk with you  about Health Watch?       No, but I know who did.    So that was okay. I  said,    Now, I   ll probably need them one of these days, but right now, I  don   t.    After I came from Mayo, I went into the Corn Heritage Village  of Weatherford. Those are people I   ve known since    80 because my dad  was in that Mennonite nursing home in Hydro. I told him this is where  I   ll come back to. I was thinking about  Sterling House  of Weatherford  21  Larson  Kissler  Larson  Kissler  Larson  Kissler  but I don   t want to move furniture in there so I   ll just wait until I can   t  stay at home.  In talking about your exciting times in Washington, DC, and then  coming back and working in Oklahoma City, one of the things we   re  kind of interested in is when you were in the City and away from folks,  how did you kind of maintain cultural ties? It sounds like you were with  folks from your home community, even when you were in Washington,  DC.  Well, a lot of them were from school, though. However, when we had a  luncheon one Sunday and everybody that went up there from  Southwestern, well, there were thirty of us. That was men and women. I  mean, the men were in service. I wish that we   d had to register or  something that would show who they were because I have an annual  from Southwestern from that year, and when I looked in there, there  weren   t very many of us, so maybe they didn   t have their picture made  or something. I don   t know. I know that I lived with the same ones that  I   d been in church with, and, well, they   re friends all our lives. Laverne  is still my friend.  Oklahoma City, to me, it was just like Weatherford. You walk down  Main Street, someone will speak to you. I didn   t really know who they  was. My cousin told me about being at Browns one day, and she said,     Kissler? I know a Kissler.    It was me. (Laughter) I had shopped for my  mother up there, see. I didn   t have a home. I always rented. I   d shop for  my mother, always. We kept in touch with the others, somewhat. At  least I know that one time when we had that luncheon, and I was trying  to think otherwise. I know that when we moved out into that apartment  that I mentioned to you earlier that Cordelia rented for us that we had the  others come out there. That was the only time I saw some of them until I  got back to Oklahoma. They were living out in Virginia. Have you ever  lived there?  No, but I   ve been in the area. It   s very pretty out there.  Oh, and seeing Maryland and Virginia, both, I just love them. There   s no  place like, for me, to get back home. I loved getting back home. I   ll  never forget. I came home a lot, about once a month, and then after my  mother was not able to work very much, I came every Saturday. One  time I   ll never forget, I got off the bus, and I was on the street waiting.  Where we were today, that used to be the bus stop.  Oh, okay. Okay.  It was the drugstore.  22  Larson  Kissler  Larson  Kissler  Larson  Kissler  Larson  Kissler  Okay, right. Down at what   s now the downtown diner on Main Street.  That   s right, exactly right. I thought,    I wonder who that lady is with my  mother.    It was VerNell. She had grown up so much that I just couldn   t  believe she was like that. I just adored her. I know she did me, too, but  she would tease me a lot.  That   s what sisters are for.  I have never regretted going to Washington because I didn   t know how  to use a telephone. I didn   t know how to do anything. When I got there  and, like I told you, we walked around that building, around the Capitol  and saw all that, I loved it. My cousin, Eloise Hamburger O   Neil, her  brother was in service, and he came up there every weekend. We had to  go down to the Mall for the   what   s that museum down there?  The Smithsonian?  The Smithsonian   Oh, I love that.  What is now the information place, that was the main deal of the  Smithsonian. We were there every Sunday that he was here and going  through that. Now it   s blocks, I   m sure. I know that the last time I was  there, we went across the Mall for part of it. Also that Mellon Art  Gallery  National Gallery of Art  is on the north side of it. That   s the  only time I had my directions straight was when I was down there.  Otherwise, I was turned around. In that Mellon Art Gallery was the  cafeteria, real good. Across the Mall, south, was temporary E Building  from World War I. That   s where I first worked in. Then they moved us  into the railroad retirement building. That was moved to Chicago. That   s  where my cousin works. Just now retired from there after thirty-some  years.  Interesting the way your life   like, he was born in    45, after the war.  Here we   ve become real close now. There   s hardly any of us left of the  Rosenoffs. Alvin Hamburger, we went there every weekend when he  was there. There was so much to see. We would walk down to the Tidal  Basin after work in the evening because daylight savings time was  wonderful up there. What else was there about that? On Sundays, we  would go to the church nearest to us. They were just beautiful churches.  That one where we could never get in   his wife wrote a book about  him. I can   t think of his name right now. I   m sorry I can   t remember his  name right now. There   s a TV minister that I think looks like him, and  23  Larson  Kissler  Larson  Kissler  he doesn   t at all.  When I decided to come home, I told you, I came to my mother and  daddy, and I said,    I want to work in Oklahoma City.    I went over  there   the Adler girls. I told you all this already, and how easy it was  for me to get a job. Then when it closed, the men that were in the office  interviewing people, they were working wherever they could get a job.  They called.    Have you found a job yet?    I said,    No, I haven   t. I   m  thinking about going here.    He says,    Oh, no, don   t. Come to American  First.    American First Title and Trust Company. I loved it from the first  day I walked in there, and I was there fifteen years. I was a secretary in  there. Now that is just a title company, the way I understand. At that  time, it was General  Raymond Stallings  McLain was head of the  office. When he came back, Mr. Gill was in his absence, and then they   d  changed to a different company. Then I thought,    I had that civil service.  I think I better check to see what   s going on there.    I didn   t want to go  out to Tinker Field. I just didn   t like the idea of going that far to work.  My friend was working at a mortgage company up on Classen, and a  friend of hers up there was retiring. She told me about it, and I went up  there for that interview, and they hired me. That was real good because  when they took me, I had so much civil service, and the time that I had  in sick leave or annual leave, that counted. It was a positive for me to go  back in. Every time I get up and check my bank statement, I   m always  thankful that I went back because that check is nicer than the social  security check. I appreciate that that   s a private industry. I learned more  there and got over my shyness. I was especially shy. I got over that there  because they made me go to meetings and not sit with anybody you went  with. Things you have to learn.  Do you think that comes from being from a small town, and even when  you were in Washington, you were with your friends, you were with  people you knew?  That   s right. That   s right. And in the office, it was way different. Like  those two Jewish girls, Blat and Bater, they went home every weekend  to dance with those sailors. They were from New York City. Oh, they  were more fun. I just loved them. (Laughter) I loved them. The people in  the office would criticize them, and I loved them.  Speaking of going home on weekends, when you were in Oklahoma City,  did you head out and visit home a fair amount?  I did. If it was anything special, I went home, or, like I said, after my  mother was not well, I definitely went home a lot. That   s the reason I  retired early, because of my father. He was alone. I felt so sorry for him  24  Larson  Kissler  Larson  Kissler  Larson  Kissler  because VerNell was over there all the time trying to help him, and she  was raising three boys. That was good that I could go home.  Were there special celebrations that   were there special things in the  community that happened every year that everyone would come back  for, sort of like homecoming or     The things that I remember the most at our church, like the fiftieth  anniversary was really special. My uncle and aunt and their daughter and  her little girl, Anne, pregnant with a little boy, they were there to be with  us beside the other Papa   s sister from Nebraska. It was just wonderful to  see those people. Whenever we were on the hundredth or ninetieth, they  showed video of those cars that was in    53. Those were the things that  were for our church community. Then in Weatherford, for Southwestern  homecoming, we always went for the parade there. I still like to.  Southwestern has   did you ever go to school there?  No.  They have improved that. Well, every place I go, it   s improved, and  that   s good. I want to see improvements. Just like this hotel. It really  needed this update. The last time I was here, I thought,    Uh huh, this  needs it.    Sure enough, today when we were looking for it, I thought,    I  think I know it, but it better be better than it used to be.    (Laughter) It   s  being redone.  You were talking about  Southwestern  a little bit ago. What about your  school when you were growing up? Was that just in the community or     Oh, that was wonderful. Eighth grade, there was three of us in that class.  That third one, she moved, I believe, in the seventh grade. I   m not real  sure, but there was only two of us in the eighth grade. Beulah, when we  got to Weatherford High School, she graduated in    41. She was our  valedictorian, but, boy, I should   ve known that because she was helping  me all the time in school. Then the boy cousin of mine that   s a grade  behind, he was always helping me, especially with math. Anyway, that  Enterprise Grade School, one room, eight grades. The fourth, fifth and  sixth, I believe, was Mrs. Drake that I just loved. She   s the only one I  got a paddling from. It was my littlest brother, the one that died in that  fire, Kenneth, and his buddies, they all had to stay in. I don   t know what  they did. It wasn   t very bad, but they had to stay in at recess. All the rest  of the kids were out there in front, and I told this one little girl,    Open  that door.    I wouldn   t go do it, but I had her do it. One of my cousins  ratted on me.    I saw Frances do this.    Well, Frances gets it, too.  Anyway, I had to lay my hands on the table. When she got to me,    Oh, I  never thought I   d ever have to do this.    She had the ruler and was going  25  Larson  Kissler  Larson  Kissler  Larson  Kissler  Larson  Kissler  Larson  Kissler  Larson  Kissler  Larson  Kissler  to hit my hands. I was just crying, and she hadn   t even touched me.  Probably didn   t even need to.  Then I remember that I met her. She was at my mother   s visiting, and  VerNell was there. They said,    Frances, here   s one of your teachers.    I  didn   t know who it was. I hated that because I hated that I didn   t know  her.  Now, was she part of the community? I mean, was she from the  community originally, or did she come from somewhere else?  She cried and cried, telling me about how she was treated. They just  didn   t treat her very good.  Because she wasn   t part of the community, or just because she was on  her own?  They found things wrong with her, which I didn   t like. That was my aunt  and uncle. Did they have any kids in school, then? Their daughter was  already married. That   s how come she got to be with them, because she  was going to have to move in somewhere. Oh, I can   t remember. There  was too many changes during those years.  Do you remember your folks talking about whether school was in  German when they were growing up?  Church was all in German.  Church was all in German when you were growing up?  I was confirmed in German.  That   s what you said, yes.  That   s awful.  How long did that go?  Well, right after that is when Foddy, Grandpa Rosenoff, and Mr. Sauer,  (they were the senior deacons, I guess) they said,    We can   t understand  those children speaking German, so you   ve got to have the English in  here.    See, they were fighting the English, didn   t want the English in  church. They found out that they couldn   t understand their  grandchildren, so then they saw they had to make a change.  26  Larson  Kissler  Larson  Kissler  Larson  Kissler  Larson  Kissler  Larson  Kissler  Larson  Kissler  Larson  So this would have been when you were little?  No, I was fourteen.  Oh, fourteen, okay.  See, that   s     Right before the war?  Yes. In 1941, we had this minister from Moody Bible Institute in  Chicago and the minute he got here, he went to Southwestern to enroll.  He was a real nice man. Even though he had that degree, he wanted  another one. He didn   t go into the service, and I don   t know why not, if  it was because he was a minister. See, that church was just packed out  there, and they still had a lot of children. Both the neighbors on north  and south of us had ten children each. We had four.  Now, just to wrap up a little bit since we   re going to be running out of  time real quickly, what do you think   I mean, you   ve mentioned your  church and your family and the close ties that you had with people from  your community and your school. Are there particular aspects of your  life that you think are really important as far as shaping your identity as  a German from Russia?  I think you come back to our church, back to my church. It   s just always  the most important thing. It seems to still be the important thing. When I  was in the City, I worshiped at St. Luke   s Methodist. I just loved it.  When I was at home, they asked me if I didn   t want to join there as an  associate, just so they could get me on the rolls. I said,    I don   t feel like  I   m here that much,    and I wasn   t that active in the community. Like at  OCU, I loved their business courses and loved music. That   s been a part  of it always because I loved it. When I was a kid, before I went to  Weatherford High School, we were at a neighbor   s that was from  Southwestern, and he was teaching piano. No, he was teaching violin,  guitar. What else? Those instruments that you blow.  Brass or woodwinds?  Yes.  Like flutes or clarinets?  Oh, yes.  Trumpets, trombones     27  Kissler  Larson  Kissler  Larson  Kissler  Larson  Kissler  Larson  Kissler  Larson  Kissler  The one that    boom, boom, boom.     Tubas.  Yes  Those big ones, yes. We went every other week, I think it was. It  cost a quarter to take that lesson, but, oh, I loved it. See, we had this  band in church beside the choir. Laverne, I bet a dollar she will tell  something about that violin because we   d play that violin. I   d be  practicing at home, and Mom and them,    Oh, get outside. That   s  screeching.    (Laughs) That, the music, was so important. Then when I  was in Washington, did we get to go to anything? The movies were so  important then. We   d wait two hours for that movie to be over for us to  get in there. We   d wait out there in the lobby. That   s how many people,  wall-to-wall people in Washington at that time. Then when I got to  Oklahoma City, it was just about as bad going to the movies. Then later  on when I got season tickets for the Philharmonic when it came back on,  loved it.  From here, since I   ve lived here in Weatherford, we went over for I  don   t know how many years, until we couldn   t drive anymore. Loved it.  Loved it. Now we have an FM radio station here at Lawton that we can  get it good, so I appreciate that and support them. But life has been  good. I love Oklahoma. I loved Washington, DC, and the cherry  blossoms. I saw them when they were the most beautiful and then one  year when they were nothing. That   s the chance you take on them. This  year I saw that in Macon, Georgia. They were just gorgeous, and I had a  friend who had just moved down there. That   s all?  Yes.  You   ve been great. I   ve enjoyed it   Thank you so much for your time. I appreciate all this.  My gosh, it brought back memories.  That   s what we try to do.  Oh, it did.  Thank you so much for telling your story.  Oh, I just   life is wonderful, you know? I didn   t say anything about my  family, did I? Not my nephews. I   ve got to get that in there.  28  Larson  Kissler  Larson  Kissler  Larson  Kissler  Larson  Kissler  Larson  Okay. Got to get your nephews in there.  From my parents, they had two boys, two girls. The one girl didn   t  marry, me, and the other one, she had three boys, and my brother, he had  two boys. Okay. And then Kenneth didn   t live. He was burned. I told  you that. These five nephews that I adore, they   re wonderful to me to  this day, and I saw them all last month quite a bit when VerNell was  seriously ill. When I lost her, that just was so hard. I couldn   t stand to  see her suffer anymore, so I have not cried since she passed away. Her  passing was so beautiful. I   m so glad I was there because she waited a  couple hours until her boys got there at three o   clock. She passed away  at three-thirty. She was waiting on them. The doctor told us it would be  midnight. It was three-thirty. She went so quickly. When they were  telling her how much they loved her around her bed, she just raised up  like this. Then she opened her eyes real wide, and her eyes were dilated  real bad, and then she went back down. I knew she   d heard their voices.  She knew they were there. With those five nephews, I have   I   ll have to  count them, but they are wonderful. The boys, Jonathan, Austin,  Zachary, Zane Ross, and Benjamin. Martha Frances, about to get her  doctorate this fall. Julian, Madeline, Kaylei. Nine,  great-grand nephews  and nieces  I think. Wonderful, wonderful family. I love them all. Thank  you.  They sound great.  They are. They   re just   those two. I wonder what Barb told about them.  See, they were in Chicago. They were in Chicago at the Mercantile  Exchange, and, oh, Lord, the first time I saw them working, we rode the  train in there that morning, and he had on a starched shirt and a tie and  the suit. Boy, he looked great. I looked down there on the floor, and that  tie came off.  Which one was this?  Weldon and Dennis, both, the Kisslers. They made their fortune up  there. Then they came home here. Dennis is in banking in Oklahoma  City, and Weldon, he   s working his investments out of his home in  Chicago and here. Or Oswego, outside of Chicago. Then the Bergens,  okay, they had three pharmacists.  They all did well, it sounds like.  They had to go to college. That was the main thing for that generation.  You look around the church, and that   s with every family.  Do a lot of the younger folks move out, then, and have to work in the  29  Kissler  Larson  city?  Yes. See, all five of those didn   t live here until now. Weldon is here. He  should take over the farm, but Calvin won   t let him. That just drives me  to pieces.  Well, thank you again.  -------  -------
