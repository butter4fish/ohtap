Speaker 1: Thank you very much, Dr. Bates.  We're just going to start with me actually identifying this interview with something that I need to say.  My name is Racine Tucker Hamilton, and I am the interviewer.  Kerry Lane is the videographer, and this interview is taking place on Friday, March 5, 2004 at Howard University in Washington, D.C.
Speaker 2: Now, Dr. Bates, if you would, for the record, please tell me your name, your full name, and spell it?
Speaker 1: My name is Clayton Wilson Bates, Jr., C-L-A-Y-T-O-N, W-I-L-S-O-N, B-A-T-E-S, and junior, J-U-N-I-O-R
Speaker 2: And could you please tell me your date of birth and the location of your birth?
Speaker 1: I was born September 5, 1932 in New York City in Harlem Hospital.
Speaker 2: And your occupation?
Speaker 1: Right now, I am the associate dean for graduate education and research in the College of Engineering Architecture and Computer Sciences at Howard University [Washington, D.C.], and visiting research professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering.  Those are the two titles that I have right now.  I'm still actively engaged in research, so these are the types of things I'm involved in at this time.
Story_ID: 28942
Speaker 1: Now, the next couple of questions--these are some People "Magazine-ish" type questions, just to kind of help us get acquainted with one another and make you feel comfortable.
Speaker 2: The first question is, could you please tell us your favorite food?
Speaker 1: My favorite food?  That's very interesting. I don't know whether I have a particular favorite food.  I have foods that I'm interested in at various times.  Unfortunately, I still absolutely love fried chicken--always have, and that I can say is really one of my favorite foods, if I had to pick out one.  I'm sorry. (laughter).
Speaker 2: And your favorite time of year?
Speaker 1: Oh, I enjoy all times of year.  Ah, I would say probably the fall when the weather is sort of mild, it's not either too hot or too cold--one can walk around in just a jacket or sweater, so I enjoy that time of the year.
Speaker 2: Your favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 1: Oh, my dear, (laughter) I don't remember when the last time I really took a vacation.  I don't think I have a real favorite vacation destination.  I like all places, you know, that I think I can enjoy myself and have a good time.  I've enjoyed living in Europe and I would say that you can consider that one of my favorite, you know, vacation places.  I've enjoyed that very much.
Speaker 2: What about a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 1: That's very interesting, because I was thinking about that, you know, before the interview and I remember when I was in junior high school, there was a, uh--the superintendent of the school was named Elias Lieberman (ph.) and he wrote a poem called 'I Believe' and it went something like this:  "I believe that there are greater things in life than life itself.  I believe in climbing upward even when this spent and vacant thing I call my body cries (unclear).  I think that is one of my favorite phrases.

Speaker 1: Dr. Bates, tell me a little bit about your mother.  What was her name, where was she born, and where did she grow up?
Speaker 2: OK.  My mother's name was Arline Walker Bates, W-A-L-K-E-R, first name Arline, A-R-L-I-N-E, and she was born in Virginia.  Now, exactly where she was born, I just really don't know, because she does not know who her parents were (laughter)--she just never knew that.  She had an aunt who was going to tell her this, but the aunt died, unfortunately, before this was all revealed to her.  She was raised by a woman--I don't know what the relationship was to my mother, but she raised my mother in a small town in Virginia called Pamplin, Virginia which is somewhere between Appomattox and, let's say in Farmsville, that's all I can say.
Speaker 1: Can you spell the name of the city?
Speaker 2: Pamplin, P-A-M-P-L-I-N, Virginia, was the name of it.  It's really a rural free delivery post office stop, I think it is.
Speaker 1: And, what do you know about your mother's background.  What kinds of things did she tell you about how she grew up?
Speaker 2: Well, as I said, she--and I did visit Pamplin when I was a young man--a young boy, actually, and so I got some idea of where she lived, what she did--it was a farming community, a rural community, and her brother--he was not really her brother--I called him Uncle Charlie--was a minister and a farmer at the same time.  And, I do remember when I went to visit there, we would drive to church in a surrey with the fringe on top.  That's very interesting.  We'd get in the Baptist church and close that door and they didn't let us out in all that heat until it was over with (laughter). So, I got to know that community, you know--farming community.  I went down to help in picking corn and tobacco and things of that nature.  So, she grew up in a farming community.
Speaker 1: And, why wasn't she raised by her parents?
Speaker 2: Uh, I never found that out.  I just don't really know what happened, and I tried to find that out, but I haven't been able to.  Her aunt was going to tell her this, but her aunt passed away before she could communicate the information to her.
Speaker 1: And, how would you describe your mother, and did she share any particular stories with you about her growing up, and how would you describe her?
Speaker 2: Uh, let's see.  My mother was one of the hardest working persons that I can imagine.  She took care of my sister [Barbara Vallier] and I.  We never wanted really for anything essential.  I learned how to manage money by watching my mother (laughter), and uh, we--it's hard to say, I just felt very, very close to her, but I never really knew much about her background or her family.  I knew people that she associated with in Pamplin, but they weren't her real family--they were sort of adopted--they adopted her, and so that's really all I can tell you about her, but she loved us very, very much and I still miss her to this day.
Speaker 1: And, also, you begin to remember things, too, that you have forgotten?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So, how is it that your mother ended up in New York from Virginia?
Speaker 2: Oh, she came up to work, I guess.  I don't know what the reason was, but she came up to work in New York City [New York], and then she met my father [Clayton Wilson Bates] there, and they got married, and raised two children, my sister and I.  My sister is seventeen months older than I, and my parents lived together until I was about twelve years old, and which they separated because my father was just a very abusive person, and he drank an awful lot, and so my mother left him, and my mother raised my sister and I on her own.
Story_ID: 28944
Speaker 1: What can you tell me about your father?  What was his name and where was he born, and where did he grow up?
Speaker 2: OK.  His name is Clayton Wilson Bates, spelled the same way as I spell my name, except I added junior on (laughter).  He was born in, let's see, Petersburg, Virginia.  He was born and raised there.  And it's very interesting--he was a fairly decent baseball player, I guess they had the Negro League at that time, and I don't believe he played in it, but he had a job in delivering milk, actually, and so he got the nickname of "Milky".  They used to call him--some of his old friends told me that they used to call him Milky.  But, I don't think he had more than an elementary school education, but that's where he was born and raised also--in the south--in Virginia.  Both of my parents are from Virginia.
Speaker 1: And, what kinds of stories--did he ever share any stories with you about growing up?
Speaker 2: Well. no, not really.  Or, if he did, I've forgotten them.  It's been that long.  My father passed away in 1969, so it's been some time.  But, he did tell me about playing baseball, and he was always very interested in watching me play baseball when I was a young, much younger man, (laughter), and so he liked that very much.
Speaker 1: How far back can you trace your ancestors.  Who were they, do you know what their origin was?
Speaker 2: Not at all. I can say that on my father's side there was my grandfather and my grandmother.  My grandmother was Rosa Jones, and I think my grandfather's name was--I put it down--I think it was Coleman. I think it was.  But, I never saw him.  I saw my grandmother a number of times when I went to visit her during the summers when I was a young kid, but that's all I really know.  I can't go any further back than that.  I keep claiming I'm going to go down to Pamplin [Virginia] and I'm going to go down to Petersburg [Virginia] and look through the records there, and try to trace..., but I've never done it.  I've been here in [Washington] D.C. for ten years, and I still haven't done that (laughter).
Speaker 1: Speaking of your grandparents, what can you tell us about them?
Speaker 2: Oh, as I said, the only one I really knew was my grandmother, and I just have a very, very, faint recollection of her.  I might have seen her maybe once or twice before she died, and that was all.
Speaker 1: What about your visits during the summer?
Speaker 2: Well, as I said, I visited maybe a couple of times, and I did meet her and see her at the time, but I don't remember very much of the conversations that we had.
Story_ID: 28945
Speaker 1: Can you tell us a little bit about your earliest memory?
Speaker 2: Yes, that's very interesting you asked that.  Now, I'm beginning to remember.  My earliest memory that I can remember (laughter), was, I think, it was New Year's Eve, 1939.  I remember we lived near the corner of 135th Street and 8th Avenue in Harlem [New York, New York].  And, I was just walking around on 8th Avenue at that time, just thinking about another new year is coming, but that's something that comes to mind.  I just really remember that--and it keeps coming up, and I'm wondering why I remember that.  I don't have any idea at all, but I do remember just sorta walking around at that time.
Speaker 1: And, what other memories can you share with us, of growing up.  What was your family life like?
Speaker 2: Actually, when my parents [Clayton Wilson Bates and Arline Walker] were together, it was not a very happy time, because as I said, my father [Clayton Wilson Bates] drank a lot and he did beat my mother [Arline Walker]--just too often--or at all, but when my parents separated, when my mother left my father, then life became much more pleasant.  My mother worked, she was a domestic worker.  She came home, she took care of us, and we had some very, very happy times.  She was able to get money to take us down to Virginia during summers on the Greyhound bus.  When we got to [Washington] D.C., we had to move to the back of the bus, and it was just very, very, interesting, but I enjoyed myself.  I did go to visit my mother's people in Pamplin, Virginia and, actually, my father's people in Petersburg [Virginia].
Speaker 1: And, what other special memories do you have--holidays?  Can you share some of those with us?
Speaker 2: Oh, my goodness. (laughter).  I hadn't thought about that.  I didn't consider holidays--well--Christmases, I can remember, certainly. I remember what I wanted for Christmas and what I got for Christmas.  There was a difference.  But, my mother did provide decent Christmases for my sister [Barbara Vallier] and I.  We got presents, and we enjoyed them.  I always wanted an electric train, which I was never able to get, because my mother simply couldn't afford it.  I remember wanting a red wagon of some kind, and I think I did get that.  I had a happy time. I was very poor, but I didn't realize it at the time, but I had a very nurturing mother and I had friends.  I enjoyed myself.  I remember one time I asked my mother, "Are we poor?", and she kind of laughed, because I forgot why I asked the question, but it had come up, and I did ask it, because I never thought of myself as being poor--materially, or even spiritually.  I had a fairly happy life, actually.  I can't really complain at all.  I've been blessed.
Story_ID: 28946
Speaker 1: What street did you live on growing up?
Speaker 2: OK.  I lived on (unclear) Street, but in Harlem [New York, New York], I lived on the corner of 135th Street and 8th Avenue.  That was right across the street from the 32nd Precinct, and further up the block was the Harlem YMCA.  Then I moved to an apartment which was actually in a railroad flat.  We lived in one of the rooms in the railroad flat, and I think it was 131st Street near St. Nicolas Avenue.  And, I remember that my parents [Clayton Wilson Bates and Arline Walker] slept on the floor, and my sister [Barbara Vallier] and I slept in the bed.  There was only one bed in there (laughter), and I noticed that there was a window there--I could look down the air shaft there and see the rats running around there all the time, because down at the bottom there they had garbage cans and things like that.  So, I just remember that.  Then, I lived on 132nd Street between 7th and 8th Avenue right across the street from a big catholic church, and was in a basement apartment.  I lived in a number of basement apartments.  I tell a bad joke I think that Nipsey Russell made up--he's an old comedian--that we lived in so many basement apartments that my mother got curtains the color of sidewalk.  I tell that joke all the time, so those are the places I lived when I was in Harlem.  And, then I moved somewhat on the borders of Harlem, 124th Street between Broadway and Amsterdam Avenue, and then moved to the projects on Park Avenue on the East Side, and then back to the projects.  The Grant Projects are still there.  I was raised there during the '50s [1950s] and I have students who were raised in that project there.  I think that's very, very, interesting.  We lived on the 21st floor.  And then, of course I moved, when I left there, I just moved from the city.
Speaker 1: And, what was your community like growing up?  What was life like growing up, how would you describe your community?
Speaker 2: It's very interesting.  When I was fairly young, at least fairly decently, they had gangs and clubs in Harlem at the time.  I never got associated with any bad gangs or anything.  We had a group of guys, we called ourselves the Eagles.  We played baseball and we had a baseball team, and I think that was very, very good for me.  Then, we--was that the Eagles?  My memory is beginning to fail me.  I don't think we had a name for the team that I was on then, but, we did play baseball.  We were very interested in sports.  When I moved between Amsterdam and Broadway, that was the team that was the Eagles, and I played an awful lot of basketball, and we won the Police Athletic League Senior Championship, I think it was, in 1949.  And so, those were the type of sports and things.  I also played baseball with them.  That kept me out of a lot of trouble, because two of the people on that team--one died from an overdose of heroin, and one got in with the Mafia and was shot out in front of the old Theresa Hotel, and was killed on the spot there.  It was just very interesting.  So, I was lucky in a sense that I did escape an awful lot that was going on.  I just wasn't interested in it, more than anything else.
Speaker 1: Tell me what sights, sounds, and smells remind you of growing up.
Speaker 2: Oh, I can tell you one.  The smell of the hot dogs from the little cart that they sell in New York City, because I used to love those things, hot dogs with sauerkraut and mustard.  And so, I remember that odor.  That is one thing that comes to mind.  Other sights--well just the city itself.  I've always loved New York City, and my oldest daughter [Katherine Bates] takes that after me.  She's living there, and couldn't think of living anywhere else.  And there's various odors--it's very muggy in the summertime, and there's this smell of water and dampness, and I got sort of used to that.  Sights that I got to seeing--roaches crawling on the floor.  We turn the light on in the kitchen, and they'll scurry and go in all directions (laughter), and so I got used to...  Those are the things I remember about the city.
Speaker 1: What about sounds?
Speaker 2: Oh, it's just the sounds of always a siren of some sort--cars running, people arguing, talking.  And when I came back to [Washington] D.C. after living out on the west coast for so many years, that was one of the first things that I remembered--that these are the sounds that I remember when I was very, very young.
Story_ID: 28947
Speaker 1: Tell me a little bit about your elementary school years.  What was the name of the elementary school you attended?
Speaker 2: I went to Public School P.S. 119, was the name of it, and it was very, very, good.  I remember the name of the principal.  Interestingly enough, Ms. Cohen.  She was a very stately woman, and she dressed extremely well.  Most of the teachers were white, most of them were Jewish.  I had one black teacher, though, who took a real interest in me, in the sense that she was just very, very kind to me.  I did very, very well in that class and she took me to see 'Tom, Dick and Harry', which was a motion picture playing at Radio City Music Hall, back, I think it had to be in the late or early '40s [1940s] or something like that.  I remember, just because I'd done such a very, very nice job in school.  She was--Ms. Coco (ph.) was her name, I remember that.  And so, I just remember that.  And I did fairly well in elementary school.  My sister [Barbara Vallier], on the other hand, always gave them a difficult time, and they were always comparing me to her, and she didn't like that at all.  She resented that, and they would always tell her, "Oh, you can't be the sister of that nice ..." and she hated that.  I think that was unfortunate.  I didn't think that was a good idea that they should have done that (laughter).  So, I did fairly well in elementary school and junior high school, and high school and so forth.
Speaker 1: So, in elementary school you were starting to develop a love for science.  Tell me about that.
Speaker 2: Yes, oh yes.  I think I developed it before that.  As I  said I read a lot, and I got interested in airplanes for whatever reason, and built them and flew them, and flew kites.  I designed airplanes, I designed kites, and I was thoroughly absolutely fascinated by it, and that lead me to read about them and became interested really in engineering.  I wanted to become an engineer initially--become a physicist later on, was something else.  But, I just read an awful lot and just simply became that--on my own--it was no teacher who encouraged me to do this, I did this on my own.  But, once teachers found out that I was interested in this, they did encourage me to continue.
Speaker 1: About how old were you when this interest started?
Speaker 2: Oh, the interest started when I was eight years old.  I thought that was very interesting.  It was around that time is all I can really say.  I was about eight years old.
Speaker 1: And, what type of child were you.  Were you well mannered, mischievous?
Speaker 2: As my mother [Arline Walker] said, I was a very good child.  My mother told me, oh, a few years before she died, she said, "You never caused me a day of grief."  And, I realize more and more what that means to a parent. (laughter).  She said, you just never caused me any trouble at all.  I was a fairly decent kid.  I never caused any problem with police, never got out of line, and the teachers were always pleased to tell her that I was a very, very good student.  That made her happy.  My sister, on the other hand, was a hell raiser. (laughter).  We were just completely different.
Speaker 1: And at this time in your life, elementary, did you have any dreams and aspirations?
Speaker 2: Oh, it's very interesting.  I dreamed of becoming, as I said, I wanted to become a pilot.  I got into designing airplanes, but I just realized at that time I had to wear corrective lenses, and wear eyeglasses, and it was very strict then.  I knew I wasn't going to become a pilot, and so I took to building airplanes and designing them, and so the dreams were to become an engineer.  So, there was never a question of what I was going to do or become, but just how I was going to go about doing it.  So, I knew I was going to go to engineering school and become an engineer at that time.
Story_ID: 28948
Speaker 1: What about church.  Did you and your family attend church?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I'm fond of saying that I was a shouting Baptist (laughter), because as I said, my uncle was a Baptist minister, and when I would go to visit during the summer--my mother's brother--he was a preacher--we would drive to church and so I was a Baptist at that time and attended Baptist church in Harlem [New York, New York].  But, I became interested in Catholicism, and one of the reasons I became interested in Catholicism, and eventually converted, was because of the consistency of the message that I got from the priest.  One priest would tell me exactly the same thing that another priest would tell me about the same subject matter, whereas I didn't hear that from Baptist ministers.  Some preachers said gambling is sinful, you're going to go to hell, and others said it was allowable under certain circumstances.  And, I think at that time, consistency was very important to me, and so I converted to Catholicism based on that.  It's just very interesting.
Speaker 1: What age was that?
Speaker 2: Oh, I think just before I entered Manhattan College [New York, New York], which is a Catholic college in New York City, Brothers of the Christian School, St. John Baptist DeLasalle, and I converted at that time, but I was going to mass certainly every Sunday, and for a period of time, actually, everyday.  And when I got into Manhattan College, in the School of Engineering, I almost became a Franciscan priest.  As I said, I was going all the way, it was very interesting.
Speaker 1: What happened?
Speaker 2: Well, one of things that happened was, I got a message that--I went to talk to the Franciscan's priest--I forgot the name of the church in downtown New York City.  I got the impression that it might have been difficult for me to get into the seminary, and that was based on race, and had nothing to do with my calling to the vocation.  And, it--you know, they have what are called retreats, at catholic colleges and catholic schools in which most of the time is spent in prayer and meditation, and they always can get you then.  And, of course, you're very impressionable at that time, and I felt I wanted to become a priest, a Franciscan priest, and then a Maryknoll priest after that.
Story_ID: 28949
Speaker 1: And, as a young boy who was interested in building airplanes and engineering, was your mother [Arline Walker] helping to foster that?  How did your mother feel about that?
Speaker 2: My mother just really didn't know anything about it.  She didn't know what being an engineer meant.  She got some sense of it.  She worked for a Jewish family, she was a domestic and cleaned house for them, and they had a son who was the same age that I was who was trying to get into Harvard University [Cambridge, Massachusetts].  Well, I got a fellowship to go to Harvard University, and they took an interest in me because of this.  Their cleaning woman's son can get into Harvard, and our son can't--so, she got a sense of what engineering was as a profession just from them.  These are people that she looked up to, she worked for, and had been very, very successful, evidently.  Mr. Earnst (ph.) had a factory, and I worked in his factory some summers, actually.
Speaker 1: Where did you attend junior high school?
Speaker 2: Manhattanville Junior High School, I attended in New York City in Harlem.  I guess it's sort of peripheral, sort of on Amsterdam Avenue, just maybe slightly outside of Harlem.  So, that's where I went to junior high school.  I went there for two or three years.  I forget exactly.
Speaker 1: And, who were your friends in junior high school?
Speaker 2: Oh, let's see.  My friends were Cecil Fair--I remember their names and I can see their faces.  One friend became a detective, Quentin Fletcher.  Buddy Fletcher, who I'm still friends with today.  There was a mix of friends, actually, and it was a mixed school at that time--whites, blacks, Hispanics.  It was a real mix of people there--a number of Jewish people, a number of Greek--Victor Kervorkian (sp), I remember as a friend, Archie Drubulas (sp).  These are Greek names.  I remember them, I remember their faces--Hans Levee (ph.) was a Jewish fellow, and we had a barbershop quartet. (laughter).  Hans Levee, Victor Kervorkian, myself--and who was the fourth one?  I forgot.  But, we had a barbershop quartet that we fooled around and sang songs.
Speaker 1: Were you still very interested in engineering?
Speaker 2: I was always interested in engineering.  And, a very interesting thing that happened.  I went to Brooklyn Technical High School.  You have to take an entrance examination to get into the high school, and I remember I took it when I could the first time, with a gentleman--I still remember his name, I don't know why.  My wife accused me of remembering things which are totally useless.  Harry Waldhime (ph.) was his name.  Well, he passed the first time, and I didn't and that hurt me very, very much.  But I did take it the second time, the year after, did get in, and did extremely well. It was very interesting.  I graduated well ahead of Harry when he was there.  I graduated about fifth in a class of over six hundred students.  So, once I got in, it was fun, but I didn't pass the exam the first time to get in.  And, I've never been set back by failure.  I want to mention that, and that was one of the first times that happened.  I've always believed in myself and what I could and couldn't do, and I knew what I wanted to do and what I like to do, and so failure is going to happen.  That is never something that has beaten me down to the ground, and I've failed a number of times in a number of undertakings.
Speaker 1: And, how were you being received by your peers and your friends--this kid who is so interested in science and engineering?
Speaker 2: They were quite impressed because there weren't any other kids on the block who were interested in those things, and they were just very pleased to know that I was doing this, and I never got a difficult time from them.  They always encouraged me when I would walk by.  Instead of hanging out on the corner and chatting, I was going to do homework and things that like that.  They would just wave and just say, "keep going", and things like that.  I just never got a difficult time from them at all.  They were very encouraging.
Story_ID: 28950
Speaker 1: Dr. Bates, where did you attend high school?
Speaker 2: I went to Brooklyn Technical High School in Brooklyn, New York, and I attended the 50th anniversary, I think it had to be, it would be four years ago, and some of the same old guys--I didn't remember many of them, but I remembered a few of them.  I remembered the gymnasium, because I played basketball for Brooklyn Tech.  I played baseball.  I ran track.  I was a 3-letter person there, in addition to being in what is called the college prep course.  They had two tracks.  One was for those who were going to college, and then there was the industrial track, for those who were going out to work in industry, and I was on the college prep course.  So, I had four years of French, I had four years of English, I had four years of math, but I also had four years of shop and mechanical drawings and everything like that.  So, it was an excellent education.  I think that in the early '70s, early to middle '70s [1970s], it was an all boys' school at that time.  They began admitting women, and so it is co-educational.  They have females there now.
Speaker 1: And, who were some of your teachers there?
Speaker 2: Oh, my goodness now.  Let's see, I really can't--a name does not come to mind, unfortunately.  I can see a picture of my English teacher, who was a very, very, nice young man.  But, I just don't remember the names of any of them right now (laughter).  I'm trying to think of the basketball coach, because I should remember him.  He died a number of years ago, but that's terrible I can't remember--I'll probably remember after this interview is over, but I just don't remember the names of many of the teachers there.
Speaker 1: At this time of your life, who was influencing you?
Speaker 2: I still think my own interests--my own driving interests.  As I said, I wanted to go to college, and Brooklyn Technical High School was a great school.  I would for a shop examination.  We had exams in shop--wood making, metal making, we had machine shop.  We would have an examination in these, and I would stay up until 2:30 in the morning, just studying for those shop examinations, so I was driven to do well.  I wanted to do extremely well.  So, that's what I do remember. Because I remember the teachers were very, very demanding.  They were no-nonsense teachers in those days, and so, I enjoyed it very much.  It was an absolutely first rate experience for me.
Speaker 1: And what were you thinking you wanted to be?  What were you thinking you wanted to do?
Speaker 2: Well, I knew I wanted to be an engineer.  It wasn't clear what field of engineering I wanted to go into.  I knew I wanted to go into science and engineering.  Because of my love of building model airplanes and designing them and flying them, aeronautical engineering was something I thought about going into, simply because I had an interest in that.  And so, I began thinking about aeronautical engineering, and that meant going to a school which had a program in aeronautical engineering, and that was New York University [New York, New York].  So, when I was in high school, I was hoping that I would be able to get into the New York University School of Engineering and study aeronautical engineering.
Speaker 1: So, why didn't you end up taking that track?
Speaker 2: But then, it changed.  It was very, very interesting.  I tell my students this now.  It's alright to change.  At least set some goals, have some ideas of what you want to do, but as things come into your life and affects you, you have to accept this, that this is what is happening to you.  I didn't really have good advice, I think, from some of the counselors there.  I felt that aeronautical engineering was a combination of mechanical engineering and civil engineering, and if I couldn't get into New York University, because it was a very expensive school, then maybe I can go somewhere else and study mechanical engineering.  See, all these types of things were going through my mind, and so, I knew I wanted engineering, but absolutely I had been reasonably set on aeronautical engineering, but it wasn't clear that I was going to do that.  It was so interesting--let me point out--and this is very, very, important at this time--it was all of interest to me, whether it was mechanical engineering, civil engineering, chemistry--I enjoyed all of those things.  I enjoyed the most mundane aspects of them, and that is what has made me, I think, as successful as I have been. Because there are many, many people brighter than I, there's no question about that.  It's just that there was nothing beneath me in the sense that I didn't want to pursue this or get involved in this because it was too mundane and everything, and all areas and aspects of engineering were of interest to me.  I think that's very important.

Speaker 1: So, how did you end up at Manhattan College [New York, New York]?
Speaker 2: Okay, I ended up at Man- Col-. Very simple reason.  It was practical.  I could not afford to really go to college (laughter) (unclear) at all. I even had to have money books and things like that, because my mother [Arline Walker] simply couldn't afford it.  I could work during the summer.  Manhattan College offered me--and I was at the period of my life when I was converting to Catholicism--and so they offered me a full tuition scholarship, but they also paid for my books and everything, and supplies.  So, it was a no brainer in a sense.  I would work during the summer, but the money went to my mother.  Here I am going to school, and my mother's working and I just felt somewhat guilty about that, so I worked during the summer and all the money I got, essentially, I gave to her during the summer.  So, I was able to go to school in the fall during the school year without causing her any financial grief at all. So that was important. So, that's how I wound up at Manhattan College.
Speaker 1: What were your experiences like there?
Speaker 2: They were fairly decent experiences.  They were very good in the sense that I got in with other students.  I remember their names, now.  There was Richard Casey, Francis Patrick-- Francis Coore (ph.) and the three of us sort of hung out together.  And we were three of the better students in the whole electrical engineering department, anyhow, and I think that Francis may have graduated ahead of me.  I think I may have graduated third or fourth in the college there. When I did graduate.  The experiences were fairly decent.  I didn't socialize very much with them, you see.  I would travel up from Harlem [New York, New York], get on the subway and the elevated train and get off at Van Cortland Park.  That was the last stop, I think on the IRT, and I'd come home at night.  And so, I had these two worlds.  I was in this white world as the only black engineer at the school at the time I was there.  There was one before me the year before, in civil engineering, and then I would come home to the black community, so I lived in two worlds, and it was just very interesting.  So, it was fine.  One satisfied me in one way, and the other in another way.  So, I had very good experiences when I was at Manhattan College.
Speaker 1: It was fine for you, but how was it for the world?  Were you being accepted in both of the worlds?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, there's no question about that.  As they call this the law of small numbers--if you're the only black person, or maybe one of two black persons in a class (laughter) or something like that, there's no real problems unless you're causing problems.  You're accepted because you're not bothering anyone.  So, only when the numbers increase, and when there's competition for other things--and we may be talking about social situations--but that never occurred.  I was accepted certainly in that community in Manhattan College, and certainly when I came home, no one held it against me because I was going to an all white school at all.
Speaker 1: Were you involved in any organizations while at Manhattan College?
Speaker 2: I don't think at the college itself.  No, most of my extracurricular activities took place in the black community.  I played an awful lot of basketball.  I played on a good team.  We had a team that was known throughout Harlem.  I played pickup games with people on the Globetrotters [Harlem Globetrotters basketball team], and I knew some of the Globetrotters at the time.
Speaker 1: Do you remember which ones?
Speaker 2: Oh, my goodness.  My goodness, let's see, who can I think of now? (laughter).  You would have to ask me that question.  The name will come to me, as I said, when this interview is over.  It might not have been the big name ones, but like the guy who could dribble very well.  I've forgotten.  But, they were bona fide members of the Trotters [Harlem Globetrotters basketball team], and they knew me and I knew them and played pickup games with them.  I played basketball games in the Rucker's Tournament, which was in New York City.  I remember Rucker [Holcombe L. Rucker].  He worked for the recreation department there.  I remember when he started this, and he played games during the summer.  I remember playing a game against Wilt Chamberlain, who came to play in that tournament.  So, I had a very rich life, a very, very good life.  During the summertime, I played baseball with my friends.  I stayed out an awful lot of trouble.
Story_ID: 28952
Speaker 1: So, after you left Manhattan College [New York, New York], what did you do next?
Speaker 2: I got a job.  I worked for a period of time because it wasn't clear to me at this time--let me tell you how I got into electrical engineering.  I got a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering.  I started out in civil engineering because of this--what I told you before, that aeronautical engineering is a combination of civil and mechanical engineering, but after my freshman year, I just did not like civil engineering.  And switched over to electrical engineering, so I got a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering.  And when I graduated, I got a job with, let's see, I worked for RCA, Radio Corporation of America, in Camden, New Jersey.  I worked for them.  I got a job after working for them with a company, let's see, what was the name of the company?  Because it was the company that worked on the Sea Wolf, which was the second nuclear powered submarine.  That's terrible, I can't think of the name of the company.  Oh, it was a division of Sperry Rand, but I can't think of the name of it.  I worked for them.  I worked for Sylvania Electric Products and was going to school at night trying to get a master's degree in electrical engineering.  I wasn't going full time.  I didn't feel that I could go to school full-time because, as I said, I had a mother [Arline Walker] that I had to think about, so I did work and contributed to her support, so I was just going to school at night.
Speaker 1: When did you receive your masters, and where from?
Speaker 2: OK, actually, I got a full fellowship to Purdue University [West Lafayette, Indiana], actually going for the Ph.D. and wouldn't of course, have anything like that.  But I got to West Lafayette, Indiana.  In that period of time, that had to be probably the late '50s, 1950s and I hated the place.  I rented a room from a black woman who had a home there in West Lafayette, Indiana, and a very, very nice woman.  What I found out was that, there is a real train called the Wabash Cannonball.  There's a folk song that tells about the Wabash Cannonball.  Because at 3:00 a.m. every morning.  That train would come roaring by with the lights flashing, with all the rambling and everything like that.  I used that as an excuse to drop out of there.  I just did not like living in West Lafayette, Indiana.  Fortunately, I was able to because I still had an offer from Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn, Polytechnic University [Polytechnic Institute of New York University, Brooklyn, New York] now, now to pursue a master's degree in electrical engineering there, so that's where I got my master's degree.  I left Purdue University and went to Polytechnic Uni- Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute and got a master's degree in electrical engineering in 1956.
Story_ID: 28953
Speaker 1: And, after you left there?
Speaker 2: Then, I worked again.  As I said I could never justify going to school and working so, let's see, what did I do after that, exactly.  I think what I did at that time was--while I was at Brooklyn Poly [Polytechnic Institute of New York University, Brooklyn, New York] of --let me finish that, it's very interesting now it's coming back to me--I had gone on.  I was going to get a Ph.D. in electrical engineering, but actually, at Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn.  It was actually a D.E.E., a doctor of electrical engineering degree, and I'd gone through taking all the courses.  Again, this is at night.  The thing about Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn was that it was an evening school, and you could work in the day and go to school at night.  I think at that time, I was working at Sylvania Electric Products out in Bayside, Long Island and going there at night taking classes.  I'd gone as far as taking all the course work for the Ph.D. or the doctorate in electrical engineering.  What happened, was that my master's thesis had to do with transistors, which were just coming into their form at that time.  That's how long ago this was, and I got interested in the transistor as a solid state device, as opposed to vacuum tubes, which were vacuum devices, and got interested in solid state physics.  So, I decided I wanted to start all over again working on a Ph.D. in physics, so I dropped out of Brooklyn Poly (laughter) and I worked for--as I said, I was working for Sylvania Electric Products at the time, and I think at that time I did apply to go to Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts], and got a master's from Harvard University.  After going there for some period of time, I dropped out again, because I didn't feel I could just continue going to school, because my mother [Arline Walker] needed support.
Speaker 1: What years were you at Harvard?
Speaker 2: I was there from about '57 [1957], 58 [1958] until '60 [1960].  I was there just a couple years for a master's degree.
Speaker 1: How did your mother feel about that?
Speaker 2: She liked that.  She enjoyed--I think my mother's main concern--(unclear) I was providing for  her.  I was providing some financial support.  That was always in the back of my mind.  I was always concerned about that, and so as long as she felt comfortable with that, I was happy with what I was doing, but I didn't feel that I could just spend a lot of time--I worked in the summer and provided support for her.  When I was in school, obviously, I couldn't do that.
Speaker 1: And after you left Harvard, where did you go?
Speaker 2: Let's see, I'm trying to think where did I work after I left Harvard.  Ah....
Story_ID: 28954
Speaker 1: Let's talk a little bit about your Ph.D. after you left Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts].
Speaker 2: OK.  Well, I got my Ph.D. from Washington University in St. Louis [Missouri], and the reason I went to Washington University in St. Louis was because of the gentleman who was there that I had read about, and I was interested in doing research with, and I got money, at least for the first year, from my mother's [Arline Walker] employer, the people that she worked for.  They simply gave me the money to go for a year, and after that I was able to get a fellowship.  Then, I was really committed to maybe getting the Ph.D. in physics without an engineering tail or anything like that at all.  So, that's what I did.  I got my Ph.D. in physics in 1966 from Washington University in St. Louis.
Speaker 1: What was that like for an African American man?
Speaker 2: In St. Louis, or just what?
Speaker 1: Just in general, a Ph.D. in physics?
Speaker 2: It was very interesting, because [Walter] "Walt" Massey who's the president of Morehouse University [Atlanta, Georgia], and I were roommates.  It was very interesting at the time.  And I didn't think of it in racial terms, because even when I was in engineering, I was the only black person in the class.  It was science.  This is what I was interested in doing, and at that time, I was moving more to the area in physics more so than engineering.  So, I didn't think of it in racial terms, even though we were the only two blacks at Washington University.  We were the first two to get Ph.D.s in the department there, and I don't think they've had any since that time.  That's OK.  So, I didn't think of it racially, I just thought it was something that I wanted to do.  And my experience had always been that people treated me well in physics, that was all.
Speaker 1: What were you thinking that you really wanted to do at this point after you'd gotten your Ph.D.?
Speaker 2: After I got my Ph.D., it was very interesting.  The advisor, the person I worked with--a very, very well known physicist who died some years ago--got me a job in industry.  I was toying between doing a post doctoral fellowship at a university, or going into industry.  He recommended I really go into industry and get really more industrial experience than I had.  So, I got a job working for Sylvania Electrical Products in Palo Alto, California, where he had been a--he had consulted for them for very many years, and I worked in their, what is called their central research laboratories.  So, I started, at least, to work there.
Story_ID: 28955
Speaker 1: At around this time, you were also beginning to work on your first patent?
Speaker 2: Well that's right.  That was actually before that.  The first patent came when I was at Sylvania Electric Products in 1956.  I was still a student at the time.  I had to be about twenty-four years old.  I probably was going to school at night at Brooklyn Poly [Polytechnic Institute of New York University, Brooklyn, New York]--I was going to school at night finishing up at Brooklyn Poly at the time and I found out something about me at that time with that patent.  It's very interesting.  I found out that I was an ideas type of person.  My greatest strength was in the fact that I could come up with ideas that maybe other people hadn't thought about before.  And, I found out that that was true as I went on, when I went to work in industry at Sylvania Electric Product, was really the first, after I got my Ph.D. job, that I had.  I worked on a product line that I was responsible for developing.  It was an x-ray image intensifying tube and it was a product line that earned the company money, and I won what is called the Varian Sabbatical Award, after only being there for a couple of years.  Whereas that award is normally given to someone who's been there ten, fifteen, twenty years, and that allowed me to work at the Imperial College of Science and Technology in London, England on full salary for a whole year, so that was very, very nice.  I enjoyed that, and that was due to the work that I had done in developing this x-ray intensifying tube.  I found where my talents were.  I could do those types of things--a lot of things that people had not done before, and....
Speaker 1: Let's talk about your very first patent, and was that the x-ray imaging intensifying tube?
Speaker 2: That, I think that was the first one.  That's right, it was--it had to do with--it was a new type of x-ray imaging intensifying screen that detected the x-rays.  That was important.  It was a new material that someone had found was very, very useful in detecting x-rays but they didn't understand the mechanism in which the x-rays were converted into a light image.  I was the one to determine that, and I got a patent for that while working for Varian Associates.
Speaker 1: Tell me a little bit about--were you happy with the way your life was going.  Were you happy with your life?
Speaker 2: Yes, I was very happy with my life, because let's see, after I started working for Varian Associates, I got married.  I got married before I got the Varian Sabbatical Award.  I was working for Varian Associates when I got married, but then I got the Varian Sabbatical Award, flew back to New York City [New York] and got married and brought my wife over to London with me, so we spent a year together--and that turned out to be very very--that was a very, very good thing.  I had a furnished flat in London, which was centrally heated, which was unusual at that time, and so it was a very, very good year, and a very profitable year, too, in terms of my scientific achievements and accomplishments.  I did a number of things at that time.
Speaker 1: Was this one of the first times when you were actually starting to realize that this career path could be very profitable?
Speaker 2: Oh yes, I enjoyed it.  You see, the thing is that I don't think I necessarily thought in terms of profit, but how I enjoyed it.  Again, as I said before, I enjoyed all aspects of science and engineering.  As a matter of fact, the product, the x-ray image intensifying tube--yes, I described the mechanism of the conversion of the x-rays into light-- but the thing that really got the product marketable was the output phosphor screen, like you see on the television tube.  Those are made at a certain process which is very expensive, the did it by an old technique.  I developed a technique which was faster, which was cheaper, and that was the thing that allowed Varian Associates to put this product--to market it, and to get them in that business.  It was very, very interesting.  And, that was a grubby technique.  It had nothing to do with science--hard science--but it had to do with processing types of techniques--suspending particles in various fluids and things like that, which a number of scientists and physicists might not look upon as being noteworthy.  But, I enjoyed it very much, and did develop a process which Varian Associates eventually sold to the Chinese to make these types of screens.  So, that's what I found out.
Story_ID: 28956
Speaker 1: Tell me a little bit about how you met your wife.
Speaker 2: Oh, it's very interesting.  I met my wife when I came down from Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] on a weekend and a friend of mine at the time was Dr. Ben Payton, who's president of Tuskegee University [Tuskegee, Alabama] now.  See I know all these college presidents now.  He was in the Divinity School at the time, and he came down and he said he was going to visit a friend of his, Mary Creeley (ph.) at Barnard College [New York, New York].  So, I went with him, and Mary Creeley--her friend--(laughter) turned out to be my wife, walked up. you know.  So, that's how I met my wife, in that way.  I still remember how she looked when she was walking down the hall and we were waiting for her.  She had very, very long legs, which she still has, obviously, and it was very, very interesting.  I still remember that and that's how I met her.  So, we dated on and off, but we didn't get married.  That had to be in, close to 1960.  We didn't married until 1968, actually.  So, there was a long distance romance.  They say long distance romances don't stand a chance, but we managed to work things out.
Speaker 1: Tell me a little bit about your time at Stanford [University, Palo Alto, California].  When were you there, and what was that experience like?
Speaker 2: That's very interesting.  When I was working for Varian Associates, after development of this x-ray image intensifying tubes, I got involved in some other scientific endeavors.  One of them had to do with amorphous materials, which was a new material that was used for any number of things, amorphous silicon.  I did some measurements with the technique that had not been done before, and revealed certain properties of these materials.  Varian Associates was, excuse me--Stanford--I lectured at Stanford University.  I taught a course there when one of the faculty in the department of material science and engineering was on sabbatical, so they knew me in this sense.  So, when their effort--they made a strong effort to do work in amorphous materials, I had already done that.  So, that's how I got an offer from them.  It's very interesting.  I got an initial offer from them in the, let's see--I'm trying to think--in the early '70s [1970s].  But I didn't think they offered enough, so I turned it down.  Someone said, how can you turn down an offer from Stanford University?  See, institutions are not the alpha omega of my existence--it's what I'm interested in doing and planning at the time.  But 1976--excuse me, I want to get this straight--I went there in '72 [1972], so it was before that.  It was in the late '60s [1960s] that they made the initial offer.  In '72 [1972] they made me an offer which was a good offer and I decided.  I said Stanford is a good place to leave if I want to go somewhere else.  I never asked for tenure or anything like that.  I always felt that I could always get a job.  And I did get tenure in four years, actually.  I was moved up to full professor in that period of time.
Speaker 1: Did you ever think that you would spend twenty years of your career there?
Speaker 2: No, I really didn't really think that.  But, I got involved in activities on the campus there, which sort of kept me there.  I became the resident fellow in the black theme house.  So, I ran the program for the African American students who were interested in doing cultural things, so I got involved in that.  I also got involved in setting up what was called the Society of Black Scientists and Engineers at Stanford University, which was a precursor to the National Society of Black Engineers, which came some years after that.  So, we celebrated last year the 30th anniversary of the founding of that organization in 1973.  They invited me out to give this talk, and so forth like that.  I was the only faculty advisor for twenty-two years that they had until I left, and now Professor Reggie Mitchell, who's a black associate professor in the mechanical engineering department, is an advisor.  But, I started then and was the advisor.  And, so that's why I stayed there because there were a lot of things to do for the black community, not necessarily for my own career, but that was going fine also.  It was a very supportive institution--a very wealthy institution--it paid for my kid's education.  I got a decent salary and I enjoyed it very, very much.  I liked living in that area.
Speaker 1: Why did you think it was important to start this organization?
Speaker 2: Society of Black Scientists?  Oh, because there were a lot of things that black students were not told about engineering because most of them did not come from backgrounds that had an engineer it in.  That's the same with me, so there's a lot of things that I felt that they could get through such an organization.
Story_ID: 28957
Speaker 1: Dr. Bates, in 1972 you helped to found and organize the Society of Black Scientists and Engineers at Stanford [University, Palo Alto, California].
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was actually in 1973.  In other words, we began the process, but became officially organized in 1973.  And actually, I was approached by a black student at Stanford University, let's see, Anderson--Arthur Anderson was his name, who thought this would be a good idea.  He asked me, as the only black faculty member there, to help start an organization because he felt there was a need for this organization.
Speaker 1: And why did you think it was important?
Speaker 2: It was important because black engineers--black students--aren't told the same thing as white students are, by a white professor, for instance.  And also, our backgrounds were such that most of us came from backgrounds which there were no engineers.  Many of the white students in engineering at Stanford University, and the majority of institutions, they either knew people or their fathers or their parents--some of us--some of those students were in college, and it was the first time anyone in their family was in college.  So, they're not going to have a chance to speak to engineering.  So, there was a lot of things of that nature that we wanted to bring to the students.  We wanted to talk them in maybe more detail about the various careers, for instance, patent attorneys and things like that who were engineers with a lucrative field which you would not get in a normal course offering.  We brought in black patent engineers who were doing extremely well.  We brought in black entrepreneurs who would tell them really how to get a loan from a bank when you don't have any collateral or anything like that.  So, we got very important information like that, that students needed to know, that would normally not get in the class and that many of their white colleagues, students, would probably have information on, just simply because of their background.  And that was their course.  We gave it at night and they loved it.
Speaker 1: Can you tell me a little bit about some of the early initial meetings?  About how many students were involved?
Speaker 2: Oh sure.  As a matter of fact, Ken Perry, who just left Clark Atlanta University [Atlanta, Georgia] because they shut down--he is one of the students that helped found the Society of Black Scientists and Engineers at Stanford University.  The core of students were mainly graduate students, but we did have some undergraduate students.  As I said, the young kid who came to me approached me about this was one, but there was John Tremble (ph.), who's a faculty member here at Howard University [Washington, D.C.], was one of the founders of the Society of Black Scientists and Engineers at Stanford University.  As I said, there's Ken Perry--oh, I have to remember some of the names--but it was mainly a graduate student organization that ran it.  We had meetings on a regular basis, and one of the first things we did, and I thought this was very, very, interesting, was to have a conference or meeting of all the high school students, minority high school students in the area, to bring them to Stanford to try to encourage them to go into science and engineering to see what it was like, and I was amazed.  We had over six hundred students to show up for that, and they came from as far away as down the Monterey Peninsula.  They drove up in buses, but we worked on that, and it was an outstanding success.
Story_ID: 28958
Speaker 1: In your twenty-two years at Stanford [University, Palo Alto, California], how did you see things change in terms of African Americans in the engineering and science Department?
Speaker 2: I can tell you one thing that's very interesting.  When I first came to Stanford, I didn't have any majority students who would do their research under me.  They were always sort of feeling you out, and I found that this was true at other institutions at UC Berkeley [University of California, Berkeley].  I had Chinese students, I had Indian students, but I had no majority students, no white students, until I was there for a while and they found out that I could do work, I could support them and so forth.  Then I began to get the best white students who were in the department.  I had a joint appointment at Stanford University.  I was a professor in both the material science and engineering department--that's material science and engineering--I say to myself material scientist--and the Department of Electrical Engineering.  So, I did both, and I taught classes in both departments.
Speaker 1: When did you really start to notice a change in the numbers, in terms of the numbers of African Americans who were beginning to become interested in this field?
Speaker 2: Well, it's very interesting, because Stanford has a track record, a very good one, that goes back.  They're smaller than places like MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts].  At one time, Stanford University graduated close to fifty percent of all the Ph.D. physics African American students in the country.  That's because there was an effort in the department by certain faculty members--white faculty members--who took that upon themselves to do this.  The number increased.  The numbers are still small.  They're not very, very large.  I don't really have a fix on what they are now, but, Stanford, to its credit, has always had an effort, at least, to increase the number of minority students.  They've had a dean that worked on this sort of thing that provided fellowship monies to support African American students.  And any graduate student, any African American graduate student that is admitted into the School of Engineering there is going to be supported, it's as simple as that, but they have to be good enough in order to get in.
Speaker 1: Why do you think it's important for other schools to really encourage and support minority involvement and interests in this field?
Speaker 2: I think because we need more minority students in this field.  We need more of a representation in science and engineering.  We don't have the representation that we should have, simply because science, engineering, and technology--that is running things in the world today, and we need to be involved in the decisions that are made that involve science policy because it's going to effect the communities in which we live.  We need more African American scientists to think in terms of working on problems that are peculiar to the African American community, and not just the community at large.
Speaker 1: Such as?
Speaker 2: You mean types of things?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Things in terms of safety.  In other words, what types of things can we do to increase safety.  What types of lighting and things like that would be acceptable, economically feasible, things of that nature.  What about housing, materials, and things like that.  All types of questions like that, and I think it's important that we get involved in working on problems that are peculiar to us rather than selling products that are made for, I think, the majority population.  I think we need to get involved in things that evolve our community more.  I mention things of that nature--safety, housing, configurations, things like that--materials, low cost materials.
Story_ID: 28959
Speaker 1: So, after twenty-two years at Stanford [University, Palo Alto, California], how did you get to Howard [University, Washington, D.C.] from there?
Speaker 2: Oh, it's very interesting.  I never planned to spend my entire professional career at a majority institution, and so it came up.  I'd come to Howard before, giving talks, and so forth like this.  Dr. Ladner, Joyce Ladner (ph.), who was a--she was at Washington University also at the same time [Walter] "Walt" Massey and I were there.  She was acting president at the time, and so she encouraged me to come and set up and interdisciplinary program, or a department or program, in material science and engineering.  There exists now, the Material Science Research Center of Excellence, which was in existence for a number of years, fifteen--at least fifteen years now.  And, this was a research center, but there was not an academic program associated with that.  I knew the director of the Center at the time, and he also was interested in having me come to set up an academic component that trains students, in addition to just having them do research.  The dean at the time, Lucius Walker, I knew, so he also encouraged me to come.  So, I was encouraged to take an early retirement from Stanford University to come to Howard University to establish this interdisciplinary graduate program in material science and engineering, and that's what I came to do and I was successful in doing that.  Not only successful in doing that, but the model for the material science and engineering program was a template for all interdisciplinary graduate programs at Howard University, so that's what I did also.
Speaker 1: And what was the transition like from Stanford to Howard?
Speaker 2: I'm fond of saying, when people ask me that question, that I exchanged one set of problems for another.  It was interesting that when I left Stanford University--I had some very, very good friends in the department which I taught--my center of gravity was more in material science and engineering department, and one colleague of mine said, Oh good you can send us--you go over and you can send us some of your good students and go on for a Ph.D. I said "no, no, I'm not going there for that reason.  I'm going there to train students to get Ph.D.s at Howard who are going to come back and compete for positions at Stanford University."  And, it sort of took them back.  I didn't go there to have this as a minor leagues for majority institutions.  I wanted to see science and engineering at Howard University to be as good as anywhere.
Speaker 1: Is it?
Speaker 2: It has a ways to go. Unfortunately infrastructures are poor, There are a number of things.  You have to understand that Howard University is still moving out of being a predominantly teaching institution to one that's involved in graduate research, and so it's going through those pains of developing the infrastructure support, to support research and things like that.  Many of the old faculty are still teachers and not doing research, as necessary.  And so, it is moving in the right direction.
Speaker 1: Did you face any challenges or difficulties, coming from a predominately white campus to a predominantly African American campus?
Speaker 2: There's a cultural difference, no two ways about that.  For the first time, I'm seeing female students in my class with children because they have to bring them.  That does happen in our community.  And, so, and problems with what happens outside living in some parts of Howard--excuse me, some parts of the District of Columbia which are not safe, and students can get hurt and things like that.  And also, they're interested in different things.  It's a different culture.  The music is different, the types of things that they read are just certainly different, and I'm used to a white culture in a sense, even though I'm black and did a number of things at Stanford University that involved the black community there, but now I'm immersed in a completely black community.  But, that's what I came for, and I absolutely, thoroughly enjoyed it.  I have no reservations, in spite of some of the things that go on that I'm not pleased with.  I'm very happy when I walk these halls and look and smile in faces of these black students when I see them.  I'm very, very happy in doing this.
Speaker 1: What else would you like to accomplish here at Howard?
Speaker 2: Well, it's very interesting.  I'm involved in some research now, which has the possibility of really--some cutting edge research--that has the possibility of producing a new class of detectors for detecting infrared radiation.  So, I'm still heavily involved with that.  I have students, I have a post doc, and so that is my main focus at this time now, just doing this research, because as I said, I find it very interesting.  I spent a fair amount of time developing the ideas and concepts for the research and I'm now getting as much support as I can really handle.  So, that's what I'm doing now, but I want this research to be done at Howard, at a black institution--something new and cutting edge, and not at a majority institution.  That's the point.
Story_ID: 28960
Speaker 1: So, as someone who has taught and fostered thousands of students, are there particular students who stand out to you, who come to mind?  And if so, can you share some stories?
Speaker 2: Oh yes, I remember some students.  I remember particularly the African American students that I had at Stanford University [Palo Alto, California] who that institution had given up on, and would have not graduated if I had not taken them under my wing.  I remember one of the students got his Ph.D. in physics.  At commencement time, he came and threw his arms around me and just thanked me.  Now, this gentlemen is doing extremely well.  He's a tenured faculty member at a college in California.  There was one student--I had two of them---who turned out that way, who were not--who were possibly were not going to get through the system.  I was not about to let them fall through the cracks.  That was my whole attitude and idea.  Of course, I wouldn't take them on if they were marginal and not good students, but they had shown me that they were capable of doing the work, and therefore I held their little black hands to the fire--excuse my language (laughter).
Speaker 1: What's the best advice you think you give to your students?
Speaker 2: In terms of going into science and engineering, make it the thing that you want to do more than anything else, regardless of how much money you're going to get out of it.  You need to love science and engineering above most things, and if you do, you'll go a lot further than you think you can go.  You really have want to do it.  I think that's very, very important.
Speaker 1: What do you think needs to happen to generate more interest in science and engineering among African American students, and when does it need to happen?
Speaker 2: Things are happening now.  There are a lot of  internships that they offer to high school students who work at various laboratories, so that process is going on now.  It needs--what needs to happen is that the schools in predominantly minority districts do not have the facilities, they do not teach the courses that are needed, and so you lose students just simply because of that.  Further, we want to get out of the habit of just encouraging students to go into science and engineering because it's a great field and you read about it all the time.  They'd better love it, because when you go to engineering school--and I'm fond of telling students this--it's a professional school on an undergraduate level.  The learning curve is very steep, and you'd better be prepared for that.  You find a lot of good students who think, this is great, I did well in math, but they're not willing to put in the time and they eventually drop out.
Story_ID: 28961
Speaker 1: So, in addition to a distinguished career in science and engineering, you've also had another twenty-year career.  Can you tell us a little bit about that?
Speaker 2: (Laughter).  I was a professional model, actually, for over twenty years, actually.  I found that very interesting, because of the way I got into it.  My wife was doing professional acting at the time and...
Speaker 1: About what time?
Speaker 2: Oh, that was in the early '70s [1970s]. It was the early 70s I had just started at Stanford University [Palo Alto, California] and--I think we were still living up in the city in San Francisco [California] before moving down to Palo Alto [California]--and my wife was acting in various plays and actually doing quite well, and she enjoyed it very, very much.  She thought she wanted to maybe do some modeling--she's an attractive woman, and so she called the photographer over to the house to get pictures made, what's called a composite--they catch you in various poses and everything like that.  The photographer said, "I want to take some pictures of you".  Well, again, to make a long story short she took the photos that she had to a couple of agencies that she dealt with--modeling agencies--and one of the agencies wanted me and didn't want my wife (laughter).  They said my wife just held that against me since that time.  I've had a number of different types of jobs.  I've done some t.v. shots, mainly for cars.  I remember when the Cordova came out.  Ricardo Montalban was the one who advertised it.  Well, I did, and it showed up in Ebony [Magazine], and I've had pictures show up in New York Times Magazine, and so forth like that.  We did a shot of a solid gold Cadillac I remember.  It was very interesting and a lot of fun.  And, I hesitated to tell people what I did.  The models (unclear) what do you do, (unclear) I told them, they would sort of be dumbfounded and say what are you doing this for and I'd say because it's fun and it's interesting. (laughter).  That was all.
Speaker 1: Is there a particular shoot or photo session that is very memorable to you?
Speaker 2: Oh yes.  The very first one I took because it was done--I can't think of the guy's name--but it was taken by a really world famous photographer, and I can see why.  I will never look that good again in my life, and I don't think I even looked that good in the picture there (laughter).  It was for an ad for AAA Magazine.  It was on the inside cover.  It was a head shot and it said, "We don't insure automobiles, we insure neighbors."  So, I was sort of the neighbor.  And so, that is the one that stands out in my mind.  I did some for western cowboys, but that was the one that still stands out in my mind.  I just really enjoyed that.
Story_ID: 28962
Speaker 1: Are you happy with the career path that you've taken?
Speaker 2: Oh, I feel that I've been blessed.  I can't really complain at all.  I think I made the right choice, and I think it was based on the love of science and engineering, because as I said I got involved in what I call--what people would not really think as science, but as I said, it proved to be very profitable for me.  As I said, I got the Variant Sabbatical League based on looking at grubby aspects of a piece of equipment that is used as a diagnostic tool in diagnostic radiology.  And I loved it and I thoroughly loved it, because if not, you're not going to really accomplish anything and I liked all aspects of it.  I don't look down on any part of science.  If it's interesting, I can get involved in it, whether it's in something I'm interested in or not at the time.
Speaker 1: How do you feel about the way that you've lived your life, and what's important to you?
Speaker 2: Oh, my family, number one, no question about that.  And it's important--what I'm doing now is important.  I love being here at Howard University [Washington, D.C.] educating African Americans.  Because the most important thing in my professional life has been the education of African Americans to go into competitive careers in science and engineering.  That has always been the most important thing to me.
Speaker 1: How do you think your life and your career would have been different had you had an African American mentor?
Speaker 2: Oh, I can't say whether it would really have been that much different.  I've done a lot better than a lot of people thought I would do (laughter), and so I really can't say.  I've never thought about it that way, because I felt that I've done extremely well, and whether I had this mentor or not, I can't believe it would have made any difference, any real difference, any significant difference, I can't see that at all.
Speaker 1: What do you still want to do that you haven't done yet?
Speaker 2: Well, let's see.  I've done a number of things.  I used to play classical guitar.  I did that for a while.  I may want to go back to that when I retire.  But, right now my focus is on the research I'm doing, and I think the people around here understand that it's exciting and has the possibility of producing infrared detectors which have not been--it's a new concept in detection of infrared radiation.  And, again, this is an area, as I said, in which I feel that I'm helping to develop, and will hopefully get a successful device.  That's my focus right now.  So, that's the only thing I'm interested in doing, in terms of science.  That's what I'm really interested in doing right now.
Story_ID: 28963
Speaker 1: And you talked about your family.  Tell us a little bit about your family.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.  My wife, Priscilla, is a graduate of Barnard University [sic] [Barnard College, New York, New York].  I met her when I came down for a visit from Harvard University [Cambridge, Massachusetts] with a good friend of mine, Ben Payton, who is president of Tuskegee University [Tuskegee, Alabama].  He had a friend at Barnard, Dr. Mary Creeley now (ph.) who he just wanted me to meet, and my wife just happened to show up at the time, so I met her and we dated on and off for close to eight years before we got married.  My children, I have three, I think, very very lovely children.  My oldest, Katherine, a graduate of the University of California in San Diego, in La Hoya, and is now getting her master's in business administration at the Stearn's School of Business in New York City.  She worked in the financial district there for three years there before going back, and she got a nice offer from Standard and Poor's, and so she'll have a job when she gets out.  I'm very pleased with that.  My son, Christopher, is six feet, five inches [6'5"] tall.  I'm fond of telling people, "You see where I get my height from" (laughter), because I'm certainly not six foot [6'0"].  I'm close to 5'10".  He is now working for Google.  He went to the University of California, Santa Barbara.  I don't know how he graduated at all, because University of California, Santa Barbara is right on the beach.  It is beautiful, but he did finish up and he is working for Google Corporation.  My youngest daughter, Naomi, is a graduate of the University of California at Berkeley.  She has a talent for arranging flowers, and she's getting in the process of starting up her own business now, actually, for displays and things like that.  She and a friend of hers have a number of jobs for providing flowers for some weddings and things.  This is the way it starts.  So, those are my three kids and what they're doing.  They knew what I did, and I never tried to force them or wring their arm, you've got to go into science and engineering.  They made their choice.  They knew what I did.  My son worked for a summer over at Stanford [University, Palo Alto, California], setting up some lab experiments and things like that, but they were never into it.  He also played in a punk rock band, which is fine.
Speaker 1: Are you disappointed that neither of them went into science?
Speaker 2: Oh good Lord, no, no.  You have to do what you want to do.  No, I'm not disappointed at all.  They knew what I did.  I let them know that, but I never gave them the impression that I felt it was important that they follow in my footsteps at all.  People have their own lives to lead.  I just provide the support for what they feel that they want to do, and I need to support them in that.
Speaker 1: If people ask them, "tell me about your dad", what is it that you hoped they would say?
Speaker 2: (laughter).  I hope they would say I was a good father.  I certainly provided for them, and I certainly did that.  My youngest daughter, I think, made the telling remark.  And she said, you were always there when I needed you, and that was the thing, and hopefully they all feel that way, but I know she does feel that way.  I'm very close to all of my kids, closer in some ways with them more than others.  I spent a lot of time with them when they were growing up because that was the important thing to do, particularly with the girls, who, in a white environment, or majority environment, and they just find it difficult socially, so I was always concerned about that.  My son and I just never had that problem with that, and never had to worry about that.
Speaker 1: Did you spend a lot of time on the soccer field?
Speaker 2: I was a soccer dad.  (laughter).  I'd drive them to the games.  Sometimes, I was a little loud sometimes, and my daughter--youngest daughter used to get on me about it all the time.  But, she said she didn't really mind it that much.  She said the main thing is that you were there.
Story_ID: 28964
Speaker 1: What is it that you hope your legacy will be?  How do you want to be remembered?
Speaker 2: Oh, just as a decent human being.  I don't necessarily think as a great scientist or anything like that.
Speaker 1: Why not.  Why not as a great scientist?
Speaker 2: Oh, that would be alright, but that's not how I live.  I enjoy what I do, but it is more important for me to be a human being who thought about other people, their concerns and things like that.  That's the important thing.  Being a scientist is a means to an end.  I enjoy it very much.  It gives me much pleasure, but I do not need to have a glorified scientific career to feel that I have accomplished anything, or that I need this as a part of a legacy, or something.  It would be nice, but it's not essential for me at all.
Speaker 1: What is your proudest accomplishment?
Speaker 2: My proudest accomplishment?  Oh, it's just raising my children.  They never caused me any problems at all, nothing big at all.  And, my mother [Arline Walker] told me this some years before she died, and I remember this.  She said that "you never caused me a day of grief", and I remember that.  In raising my three children, I appreciate what that meant because I have colleagues of mine--majority colleagues--who just had some very, very difficult times with their kids, but I have three wonderful children.  They make me very, very happy, and I'm very, very pleased with that.  I can't ask much more out of life than that.  My health has been good.  There's nothing to complain about.  I do not lead in scientific legacy.  I enjoy what I'm doing, science is very important.  I'd like to see more African Americans in science because we need to have input into the scientific community.  That's important.  That's one profession in which we don't have as many involved in there.
Speaker 1: What about your proudest scientific accomplishment?
Speaker 2: My proudest scientific accomplishment had to do with the determination of the structure of a surface that has applications--optoelectronic applications, that has been around since the '20s 1920s and that my students and I, when I was at Stanford Uni-, re-determining what that microstructure was, and it has led to other work, to the work that I'm doing now.  That was my, I think my greatest scientific--in my mind anyhow.
Story_ID: 28965
Speaker 1: Dr. Bates, when you look back at your life, tell me what stands out the most?
Speaker 2: In terms of what?  Anything which stands out the most?
Speaker 1: Anything.  What stands out the most?
Speaker 2: What stands out the most, I think for me, is that I feel I'm a very fortunate person.  I've been blessed with extremely good health my entire life.  I've had no real disasters that occurred to me personally.  I've been very, very happy in school with my friends that I've associated with.  I've had a good life.  And, I put this in perspective because I know how the rest of the world lives, and I realize how fortunate I've been, as poor as I've been, even when I, I remember we were moving--we were the last family in the house to move out of 124th Street because they were to tear it down and build a project.  The heat was off, and I got what is called trench mouth.  That's a disease that is associated with World War I actually from just a dirty mouth because things were just not clean.  I had to sit out in the hall and study.  But, things like that were just small types of things.  I've had good friends and I've enjoyed life.  Things have been very, very good.  I've been blessed, so they all stand out.  The fact that I've had that type of life--no real extended sicknesses, or things like that.  I've just not had that at all.  As I said, I do appreciate and think about how the rest of the world lives, and I feel that I'm very, very important, so it's all been very, very good.
Speaker 1: And, why do you think history is important?  Why do you think it's particularly important in the African American community?
Speaker 2: I think history is important in the African American community, and particularly for the area that I'm in, because a lot of us are not familiar, we just do not know the contributions that have been made by African American scientists and engineers.  When I went to engineering school, I thought I was the only black engineer in the country in the world, where there were some very prominent ones before, and that if I had a chance to talk to them, that might have made some differences.  But, it didn't.  It didn't at all, but it is important, I think, for a number of students, a number of African Americans who may not be clear or sure about what they want to do.  This could encourage them just simply because of what this has done for this individual.  I mean, they're a lot of bright kids out there--African Americans--and it is difficult for them to decide what they want to do, whether they want to go into classical archeology, or whether they want to go into communications, or psychology.  I feel that I've been blessed because I always knew what I wanted to do, and it was not a question of whether I wanted to become an engineer or sci-, it was not a question of what I wanted to do, but just simply how I was going to go about doing that.  And, that's very, very important.  A lot of students--a lot of people--do not have that.  This type of history, particularly in fields in which you may not find many African Americans, is very important, because it could change the life of an African American who may want to go into science and engineering, who may not have thought about it before, but say, "look what this guy did-well, he was worse off than I was", or something like that.  So, I think it's important.  We need to know this.  And as I said, I didn't, but it didn't make any difference to me, and I have to really point that out, I'm sorry, because I knew what I wanted to do, but many African Americans just don't.
Speaker 1: Is there anything else you want to add, Dr. Bates, that perhaps we didn't touch on?
Speaker 2: Not that I can think of.  I'll think of it all, of course, after the interview's over, I'm sure.  But I can't think of anything now, I really apologize, I'm sorry.
Speaker 1: Well, thank you so much for your time, Dr. Bates, and for sharing your story with us.
Story_ID: 28966
Speaker 1: Could you describe the photo for us, Dr. Bates?
Speaker 2: Oh, that's a photo when I was about 15 years old, and I'm visiting with a friend in Massachusetts.  He invited me to his home there and we went fishing.  I met him at camp, Camp Bright Rock, I think was the name of it.  And so, that's what that photo is.
Speaker 1: About what year?
Speaker 2: Oh, that had to be about in the early '40's [1940s] I think.
Speaker 1: [inaudible]  OK, Dr. Bates?
Speaker 2: Oh, that's a picture of my mother.  Nana (sp), as most people used to call her, and I was thinking probably late '40's [1940s] or early '50's [1950's]. INTERVIEWER: [inaudible].
Speaker 1: That's a picture of my mother and I.  I believe that was at my wedding, or after my wedding, if I'm not  mistaken.  Looks like I'm dressed up for it.
Speaker 2: What year?
Speaker 1: Oh, I got married in 1968.
Speaker 2: [inaudible].
Speaker 1: Oh, my God.  That's a picture when I was about two years old taken with my sister and, so that had to about 1934 when that was taken.  It's an old picture.
Speaker 2: [inaudible]
Speaker 1: That's a picture taken at Stanford University in 1986 at the commencement for the Department of Material Science and Engineering, and that is a student of mine who did his research under me for his Ph.D.  Juan Tsau(sp) is his name.
Speaker 2: Could you spell that, Dr. Bates?
Speaker 1: Oh, good Lord.  You'll have to turn over the back.  It's spelled back there.
Speaker 2: I'm sorry... [inaudible]
Speaker 1: Dr. Tsau is his name.
Speaker 2: No problem, Dr. Bates. [inaudible] Go right ahead Dr. Bates.
Speaker 1: That's me with my wife, Priscilla, and that was taken about four years ago.
Speaker 2: [inaudible]
Speaker 1: That's a picture of me in the first modeling job that I did.  And it was taken for AAA Magazine, and it's an advertisement for insurance, with AAA, I guess it is, and it says "We don't insure automobiles, we insure neighbors", and I said, that's a picture that was taken by a world famous photographer and I've never looked that good and I don't believe I looked that good even then. (laughter).
Speaker 2: In what year?
Speaker 1: 1973.
Speaker 2: [inaudible].
Speaker 1: Oh, that's picture of me with my daughter Catherine, taken right near City Hall in downtown San Francisco.  She was about two years ago, and that had to be about 30 years ago when that was taken.
Speaker 2: [inaudible]
Speaker 1: That's a picture of my wife, my daughter, and my son.  My youngest daughter had not been born at the time, and that is in the front of the apartment that we had when we ran the black theme house at Stanford University.  Ugema (sp) was the name of the theme house.
Speaker 2: And did you say what year?
Speaker 1: That had to be about 1974.
Speaker 2: [inaudible]
Speaker 1: That picture's taken in 1966 and was taken shortly after, or maybe just shortly before, I graduated from Washington University in St. Louis for my Ph.D. in Physics.
Speaker 2: And which one are you in the photo?  Where are you in the photo?
Speaker 1: Where am I in the photo?  On the [inaudible] __________ because I had ruptured my Achilles tendon playing basketball (laughter).
Speaker 2: Thank you.
Speaker 1: [inaudible].  OK, Dr. Bates.
Speaker 2: That was a photo taken right here in this office.  You can see the bookcases in the background there.  And that was taken about five or six years ago.
Speaker 1: [inaudible]
Speaker 2: Oh, that's a picture I love because this shows--this is the Eagle's basketball team, and we were City champions in New York City with the Police Athletic League in the Senior Division.  And that had to be about 1949.
Speaker 1: This is you?
Speaker 2: There I am, that's right.  And none of those people are no longer alive, but the one on the lower right there, I'm still very, very close friends with, that I talk to all the time.
Speaker 1: Oh, great.
Speaker 2: [inaudible].  You can start talking, Mr. Bates.
Speaker 1: Oh, I'm sorry.  This picture was taken about five years ago, and it's with students who were in a program that I was the principle investigator for the Department of Energy program which had students to work in the field of nuclear energy, actually.  They worked out in Germantown and worked in the D.O.E. office in downtown Washington, D.C.  These were students that were in that program--undergraduate students, I might add.
Speaker 2: And the next one?
Speaker 1: That's a picture taken of the photo symposium on photo electronic energy devices.  I attended this meeting when I was on sabbatical for Varian Associates for developing this new x-ray image intensifying tube.  I participated in that symposium, and I also helped to organize it, and gave three talks at that meeting there.  And, that's on the steps of the Albert Hall Museum--excuse me--Albert Hall--I think that's taken out in front of Albert Hall, the steps leading up to Albert Hall which is in the background, if I'm not mistaken.
Speaker 2: In 1968?
Speaker 1: 1968.  You can spot me there.
Speaker 2: Super, that's great.  Thank you very much, Dr. Bates.
