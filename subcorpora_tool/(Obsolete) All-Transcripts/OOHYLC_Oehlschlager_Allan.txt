 Finchum  Today is July 24, 2014     Yes.  My name is Tanya Finchum, along with Alex Bishop, and we   re with  Oklahoma State University. Today we   re in Norman, Oklahoma to speak  with Allan     Oehlschlager.  And this is part of our 100 Year of Life project. Thank you for having us  today.  You   re very welcome.  Let   s start by having you tell us when and where you were born.  It was April the 13th, 1914 at 2601 Cleveland Street in Kansas City,  Missouri. Don   t go looking for it because it   s not there anymore.  And what did your parents do for a living?  My father worked for American Steel and Wire Company which is a  division of U.S. Steel. They sold fencing and wire cabling, that sort of  thing. Then he and my mother in the twenties began building houses on  speculation. They pretty much stayed in that business most of their lives.  It was sort of a second business for my dad. My mom pretty much ran  the operation. They   d draw the plans and hire the subs, and they were  kind of general contractors.  It   s kind of unusual for a woman to do that at that time period.  5  Oehlschlager  Finchum  Oehlschlager  Finchum  Oehlschlager  Finchum  Oehlschlager  Finchum  Oehlschlager  Finchum  Oehlschlager  Finchum  Oehlschlager  It was. She didn   t even know how to drive a car. We had an old Marmon  which is a huge car. Had a steering wheel probably two feet in diameter,  and my mom was five foot one, weighed 100 pounds. (Laughs) She had  to sit on a couple of pillows to learn to drive. She never knew how to  drive till she drove that car. It was a big gear shift like a bus, and I can  still see her driving that thing down the street. (Laughs)  It   d be a challenge to park.  Oh yeah. Yeah it would be. She didn   t have to, usually at the building  site, I mean, there   s always plenty of room. Going shopping, I don   t  recall how she went downtown to shop much. She and her sisters, she  had three sisters, and they all lived in a cluster. Wherever we moved,  they   d all move. They got together and sewed and made their own  clothes.  We were talking about your mother. How had she learned to do that?  Did she go to college or just     No.  Pick it up as she went?  She just   well, I think she learned it from her mother as far as sewing  and that sort of thing. But any business sense     But doing the house     We spoke German until I was five years old.  Oh, okay.  The German people are kind of clannish, I think. At least when they  were migrating to this country back in the early 1900s which brings me  to my grandfather who was a minister. He could preach in German or  English. The Methodists convinced   they had a gem there. They could  send him to any of these little communities outside of Kansas City  where he   d set up a ministry and take his four daughters with him. He  did well. How they did it back in those days I   ll never know. I figured  out one day, I doubt if he made over six hundred dollars a year and  raised a family of four daughters.  Did he go by horse? I guess at that time it would have been.  Well I think he must of done some things on the side that bring in a little  6  Finchum  Oehlschlager  Finchum  Oehlschlager  Finchum  Oehlschlager  Finchum  Oehlschlager  bit of cash or something.  Did you have brothers and sisters yourself?  I had a brother and an adopted sister. An older brother, three years older,  and then an adopted sister we adopted in 1919 during the flu epidemic  that ravished the country back in the early twenties.  Do you remember much more about that period?  No. I just remember my mother always wanted a daughter and she   d lost  her first child which was a girl. When things were right, and there were a  lot of children up for adoption in that period of time, she picked out my  sister. We had her until she was eighty-five.  How about your brother? How long did     My brother was three years older and he was a doctor. He did one of the  dumbest things a doctor could do, and when he did it he lived in Odessa   Texas . Called me and said,    Allan, I think I   ve done something  stupid.    He had pricked himself with a needle that he had just used to  inject a patient that had hepatitis and in a week he was gone.  Wow.  Seventy-one. He was a brilliant guy. But that pretty much was my  family. We, as I said, we lived in like little settlements. There were four  daughters, one never married, and the other three, my mother was the  oldest. We   d build a house here on the corner and one here and then one  over here. (Gestures) This one never went in the row. I mean it always  had to be around a corner or something. He was married to my mother   s  next older sister. Bright guy, he   s sharp, but he was just independent. He  just had to be different I guess, but he was very successful in his life and  as a builder of houses.  We all   you just couldn   t imagine how we lived back in those days.  Fridays my mom and two of her sisters, one unmarried, Emma and my  favorite. They would start baking and they   d bake coffee cakes and  cinnamon rolls and bread. I   d give my friends a taste of them, they   d  always want some. So pretty soon I had a route. We   d bake the extra  ones, and I   d go around selling them. (Laughs) It turned out pretty good,  but they were busy all the time and as I said we hardly   I don   t  remember them spending much money on clothes or anything. They   d  make them all, and they looked pretty well dressed. Our life was pretty  much wrapped up at the church, and we   d go Wednesday nights and  Sunday mornings and Sunday evenings.  7  Finchum  Oehlschlager  Finchum  Oehlschlager  Bishop  Oehlschlager  Finchum  Oehlschlager  Finchum  Oehlschlager  Was the service in German or was it in English?  The ones I went to were in English. As I said, my grandfather could  preach in either German or English. The Methodist Church has a  conference that they encompass certain areas. There   s a bishop and he  appoints the ministers to those various churches. They still do it now.  My grandfather preached at quite a number of recently developed  German communities in Kansas and near Kansas City and in Missouri  and was quite well known in that area. Of course these were small  congregations, they weren   t huge. It was very comforting to them. They  could listen to a sermon in German and they didn   t have to try so hard to  understand. They finally grew in their understanding of English. But  that   s just kind of how the country grew that way.  Well talk a little bit about your early schooling.  Well, my first schooling was in Kansas City. It all was. Right near where  I was born, just about a block away, in Greenwoods Elementary School.  I went to first grade there. Then we moved clear out to the south end of  Kansas City, which was always growing south. We went out to Fifty-seventh  Street from Twenty-sixth Street. There was nothing south of  Fifty-seventh Street. So we built three houses here and one around a  corner. (Laughter) That was the time I was growing up like seven, eight,  nine, ten, eleven, twelve. When I was about twelve we lived out farther  south, and I was in   I guess you   d call it middle school. It was the  seventh and eighth grade so I had to get on a streetcar and go from  Sixth-seventh Street down to Thirty-ninth Street and get off and walk to  junior high school. I did that for two years. Early, before I did that I got  up early in the morning and threw newspapers off a back of a converted  pickup truck. I was only probably twelve, thirteen. You get up at five o     clock and do that     Was that the Kansas City Star?  Yes, it was the Kansas City Star and Kansas City Times. Had two  papers     You remember how much you got paid?  Yeah, I got fifty cents.  For a day or a week or what?  For a day. Yeah. My brother and I both threw papers. The Sunday paper  was so big you couldn   t throw it that far so I had to get out, and  8  Finchum  Oehlschlager  Finchum  Oehlschlager  Finchum  Oehlschlager  Finchum  Oehlschlager  Finchum  Oehlschlager  Finchum  Oehlschlager  Finchum  wherever there were big porches I could just throw it on the porch.  Did you choose to do that or did your parents encourage you to?  No, I don   t know how. We just did it. I mean I did it. My brother was  doing it so I did it. It   s kind of how things go.  And how did you spend some of that money?  We always gave our money to my mother. She was the banker.  (Laughter) If you needed some, she   d dole it out to you.  Did you use some of it for fun?  Well, you   d save up for a scooter. You   d save up for this, skates or  whatever was going on. We usually had something and then pretty  soon, I think when I was about thirteen or fourteen, I started saving my  own money. I saved up enough to buy a motorcycle.  Oh.  One time I had three motorcycles. You know, secondhand and one was a  one-cylinder Indian Prince and then I had a four-cylinder Indian Racer  and then I had a two-cylinder Harley Davidson. I had enough play  things, but mostly they were used to go from junior high or in high  school to the building job where I had jobs to do, picking up scrap and  cleaning up this building site. There was always some job to do  somewhere.  So where   d you go to high school?  Went to high school at Southwest High. They had just built it out around  Sixty-fifth and, was it Warner Road? Probably. Anyway, it was a brand  new high school and I went there from   well I did four years there.  Then I, at the end of four years   I   d always liked sports but I was so  small I couldn   t go out for football or basketball. I   d play basketball in  the church leagues, but I was too small for high school. I remember  wanting to play in front of my folks and so finally I got into a good  church league and they could come and see me play.  High school, so what year did you graduate?  I graduated 1931.  Did you have a favorite subject?  9  Oehlschlager  Finchum  Oehlschlager  Finchum  Oehlschlager  Finchum  Oehlschlager  Finchum  Oehlschlager  I think it was history.  And so you played basketball for church so your parents could watch.  Yes, mostly yes. I enjoyed sports of all kinds. You know whenever the  sport was in season like baseball the kids were, I don   t remember where  we lived, but we   d get together and play. There was a lot of vacant lots  and we had plenty of places to play ball or do track. I remember we used  to pole vault and high jump and do all this. We   d make our own hurdles  and things. If you weren   t a certain size, I mean there wasn   t any point  in trying to go out for sports in high school.  Right.  But I still enjoyed them so we made do, as they say. (Laughs)  Well during that time period the Depression was on. Do you have any  memories from that?  Oh, the Depression? I remember the Depression and the only thing I  really recall was my father took away all the credit cards. Nobody had a  credit card or could charge anything anymore. You just live within your  means and Mom, as I said she kept the money under control. They were  building. They got to where they were building two and three houses at a  time and in the early thirties they got caught. (Laughs) They just were  about that far from bankruptcy. They had to give up all the property they  hadn   t paid for and houses that were half built and it was a tough time  for a couple of years there. But we got over it and we did a lot of  different things to make a little money here and a little money there.  And they stayed in the business all through that period?  Well my dad, you know, had this position at American Steel and Wire.  He was office manager. It wasn   t a very big office or warehouse, but I  mean they warehoused all kinds of cable and wire fencing, that sort of  stuff. He had a steady income. It was cut quite a bit during the  Depression. He made up for it (laughs)   I   ll never forget the time he  came home with a bunch of material and it was a punch   like a paper  punch. He could punch holes in something. It must   ve been just when  Band-Aids started coming out and he figured out   and we lined up. We  had like a production line that we   d put these things together and punch  the holes in and package them and he   d sell them. I don   t know how,  where, who he sold them to. But I mean he had it all figured out and I  can still remember punching these holes in these Band-Aids. That was  back in the thirties but we survived the Depression pretty well. We were  never big spenders so we didn   t have to pull back too much.  10  Finchum  Oehlschlager  Finchum  Oehlschlager  Finchum  Oehlschlager  Finchum  Oehlschlager  Well once you finished high school what did you do?  Okay. At first I worked a year after high school at Swift   Company and  took some courses at the Kansas City Junior College, which was an  excellent school. But the first year I didn   t go to  school , I just worked.  But the second and third and fourth years   I went three years at junior   college . Took about everything they had to offer, even geology.  (Laughs) Then applied to Wharton School in Philadelphia at the  University of Pennsylvania and was accepted. They took all my credits  from Kansas City Junior College, which was 120 I think. In 1935, got on  a train and went to Philadelphia and got my dorm room out in the  quadrangle and started in school there. Finished my college days at the  University of Pennsylvania and graduated in    37 with a business degree.  It was a bachelor   s in economics.  Why that particular college?  Well, you know, it   s a good question and I can   t really recall     That   s a long way from  Missouri .  Oh yeah, but it really wasn   t in that high of standing like Harvard. You  know, it was Harvard   it   s always been Harvard, Wharton, blah blah  blah blah   Northwestern. I think my dad must   ve had a friend whose  kids went to Wharton, because it was the one business school that we  knew about in Kansas City, other than the University of Missouri and  Kansas. It was his idea and he and my mom got together. I mean they  decided that   s what you   re going to do, so that   s what you   re going to  do. I gave Mom all my money and so we had enough money for the four  hundred dollars of   that was the tuition for semester. I rode a train back  there and got going, and I had quite a time.  What was in your suitcase on that trip?  Oh just, you know, just a few clothes. I don   t know, I didn   t have a lot,  but I did have some. The University of Pennsylvania is located on  Walnut Street and you can walk from the campus to downtown to  Wanamaker   s, the big department store in Philadelphia. Many times I   d  walk down there.  I went out for crew to start with. I don   t know why I did that but I did,  and I made the crew. I made 150 pound crew. You went out for crew  right after school about three o    clock in the afternoon and you rowed to  about five thirty. Then you came home and ate and studied and went to  school, blah blah blah, same old thing five days a week. (Laughs) I just  11  Finchum  Oehlschlager  Finchum  Oehlschlager  loved it. I just thought it was the greatest thing. I still can   t figure out  how I got started in crew, but I   m sure somebody convinced either my  father or somebody that was the thing to do.  Anyway, you met a lot of different people from different parts of the  country. I had a good time there. When I was a senior I became a   we  had dorms around a quadrangle and one of them was Provost Tower,  which was at the corner of one of the quadrangles. My senior year I was  a proctor. He   s just like an overseer, somebody who looks after these  guys. I had thirty-two freshmen in my dorm, and my job was to keep  them in school and make sure they studied. (Laughs)  My first year, well the only year as a proctor, I had two kids I couldn   t  get to study. One of them was a son of a guy that had about five shirt  stores in New York City, and I couldn   t keep that kid away from pinball  machines to save my life. Every time I thought I had him why, I   d go  down by the campus store and there he   d be playing the pinball  machines, and he was smart as a whip. The other one was a guy named  Tams Bixby  Jr.  and he was the son of the publisher of the Muskogee  paper  Daily Phoenix and Times Democrat . The Bixby family is pretty  well known down there, but Tams was a tall like   just good old country  boy and yes, I can see this blonde hair hanging out over his eyes, you  know. He was probably six  foot  one  inch tall . I got him interested in  crew and he became the stroke of the freshman crew. Well, here comes  mid-year and the grades are out and he can   t cut it.  So there I   m stuck with this kid in my dorm and I   m supposed to see that  he   and he   s the stroke of the freshman crew. I went to the coach and I  said    Rusty, would you consider going before the executive committee  and give a good pitch for Tams because he needs the camaraderie of  these guys, and he needs to be under people like Rusty Cowan.     Anyway, he said,    I   ve never done that for anyone in my life.    And I  said,    Well, will you just do it this once?    and so he did. (Laughs) He  and I, Rusty Cowan, became good friends over that but it didn   t do any  good. I mean, he got kicked out. His father came and he couldn   t help  any.  You can only do so much.  Yeah, you can. Anyway, that was crew. Crew was a big part of my life  then.  So after you graduated from there, what next?  From Pennsylvania? That was in 1937 and 1937 was the depth of what  we call the Repression. We had the Depression in    32/   33 and then came  12  Finchum  Oehlschlager  the Recession. (Laughs) It was the worse time of all and that   s the year I  graduated. Ordinarily Pennsylvania would have a whole bunch of  recruiters come there at graduation to recruit some young men to go to  work for their companies. I always wanted to go to work for a certain  company but they didn   t have anybody down there that year, but they  had a guy come from a newly formed corporation. It was formed by five  Jewish guys. Each had a company that manufactured glues and starches  and adhesives, you know, that sort of thing. They combined together and  called themselves the National Starch Products and they sent a fellow up  to recruit. Actually it was the president of the company and the fact that  I played golf, I think, was the only thing. (Laughter) I never played a  round of golf with him or played golf while I worked for him. I was too  busy and didn   t  get paid  enough. I went to work for them, and my  territory was the six New England states and here I am from Kansas  City, Missouri. I started out and of course you   ve got plenty of  opportunity there. All you have to do is dig it up and find it and try,  because everybody in some way or another, if you   re manufacturing or  whatever you use some sort of an adhesive, I mean, to seal a box or tape  paper boxes or whatever. There   s a big market out there. It   s just finding  it and having a product to fill the need they have. I did that for almost  ten years.  During World War II then.  I didn   t go to World War II. I was married and had two kids, two boys.  They were born in    40 and    42. I never was drafted but I got to know the  draft board guys in Hartford, Connecticut where I lived. I said,    You  know, I   d like to get in this thing.    They said,    You haven   t got a  chance.    He said,    First of all, you   ve got two children. Second, you   re  in an industry that   s classified as essential to the defense.    I said,    Well,  forget it then.    So anyway, I spent the war years just working in my job.  In about 1946 I came out to Oklahoma where my brother was a doctor in  Yale, Oklahoma. It   s a town of twelve hundred people, as you probably  know, between Stillwater and Tulsa, Highway 51. He had read an  advertisement in a medical journal about a lying-in hospital, an empty  lying-in hospital in this town of twelve hundred people. The fellow that  owned it was the druggist in town and he wanted a doctor to come and  open it up. It was like a hospital for unwed mothers and this sort of  thing. My brother goes down there, looks it over, and decides that   s what  he   s going to do. That summer I was off school and so I helped him  move down there and get him set up. When I left National Starch  Products I came back to Yale. My mother and father had moved there  since they retired, my brother could take care of them. She convinced  me to come down there, and my brother was in a lot of different things  at the time. He was raising peanuts during the war, and watermelons. I  13  Finchum  Oehlschlager  mean getting all the farmers around there to change their cropping  habits. (Laughs) Anyway, we worked night and day, I   d say. I checked  one time, I think I made about a nickel an hour. (Laughter)  Well when you moved to Yale what was your job?  My job was to take over the running of this farm. He was going to have  an ideal farm.    We   re going to take this run-down 320 acres that a guy  raised seven children on       and you couldn   t drive a tractor over it,  much less a car. I mean, it was so full of gullies and things. We went in  there and I remember I had a Ford tractor with what they called a blade  on it. It was a big round circular thing and you   d go like this and you   d  pile dirt like that and you   d come around put some more   you   d build  terraces. Terraces would keep the water flowing in a right way down to a  pond. You   d have a pond dug. Anyway, I did that for about   well, three  hundred acres and re-fenced it. Then when (laughs)   then I said,    What  are we going to do?    We planted lespedeza and hairy vetch and oats and  it all came up and it looked so pretty. I said,    What are we going to do  with it?    My brother and I decided    Well, let   s get some feeders and you  know, canners and cutters, and let them feed on that and fatten them up  and sell them.     I went down to the stockyards. (Laughs) I had never been to stockyards  before. I didn   t know how to buy and luckily I ran into a guy that was  pretty friendly and told him what I was trying to do. He said,    Well, let  me help you a little.    So I bought a hundred head of cattle and some of  them   I mean you, you even wondered how they even walked. (Laughs)  But anyhow, I thought the thinner they were the more we could put on  them. We brought them home, put them out in a field and they just ate  like crazy.  It got winter and we had a snowstorm, and I went out there that first day  and I saw there was a cow down at the corner, where I   d turn in,  standing over something. Evidently it had just given birth to this calf. I  looked at the calf and I hate to admit, I didn   t know whether it was a  male or female. (Laughs) I couldn   t tell from where I was standing.  Man, I told my neighbor,    Hey, I got a calf.    He said,    Got a bull or a  heifer?    I said,    Yeah, I don   t know.    (Laughs) And it was a heifer. So  anyway, that was my introduction to the cattle business, so we raised  cattle for a few years.  As I said, we had been in this Better Pasture contest put out by Skelly  Oil Company out of Tulsa. We won the contest, but we were renting this  land from the Pawnee Indians and when it got out that we had won this  prize they tripled the rent. (Laughs) I was so mad I said,    I won   t put a  foot on that land again.    So I called my neighbor next door, Homer. I  14  Finchum  Oehlschlager  Finchum  Oehlschlager  said,    Homer how would you like to have that 320 acres?    He said,     Oh,    he said,    I   d love it.    I said,    Now they   ve raised the rent.    He  said,    I don   t care. It   s still good land.    So he took it over, I got out of  the cattle business.  And then what?  Oh let   s see, really haven   t thought about that much.  Did you stay in Yale?  I stayed in Yale. Well I forgot to tell you that as soon as I moved down  there   the druggist was an alcoholic, only one drugstore in town. He  went on a binge, and my brother couldn   t get his prescriptions filled so  we bought the drugstore. The pharmacist was still okay so we took him  in as a partner. He ran the drugstore, so we had it open. Well then my  next door neighbor had the variety store, which was across the street  from the drugstore. He wanted to sell out. Now this is right after the war.  I bought him out and of course what he had was all this wartime  merchandise or stocked stuff that wasn   t worth a nickel. I paid full price  for it so I had to work my way out of that mess. Then I no sooner got  that taken care of then the fellow next door to the grocery store, I mean  the variety store, had a dry goods store. He wanted to get out of that and  go in the oil business. So I bought him out.  Then the next year the supermarket next to him   he was on the school  board and raising all kinds of hell so my brother-in-law and I, who were  partners at that time, bought him out. We had these three stores so we  just cut a passageway through the walls and you could go in and shop  the variety store, dry goods store, and then across the street was the  drugstore. I didn   t say that in 1946 right after the war, my brother-in-law,  who had been not badly injured but he had been injured in the war  and lived in New Jersey where he had married my wife   s sister, I had  taken him in as a partner so we just ran those things together.  Then the Dale Carnegie people came through Oklahoma putting on  programs to get people excited about Dale Carnegie courses. They were  looking for someone to be a Dale Carnegie leader. So my brother-in-law,  who wouldn   t even go to the first meeting, went to the second meeting,  signed up, left our business, and went with Dale Carnegie and I never  saw him again. (Laughs) So here I was stuck with all this stuff and I was  the only one left. The banker and I made a deal and he came out whole,  and I still had a few thousand left and I just came to Oklahoma City.  My mother had invested with Investors Diversified Services which is a  mutual   probably the first mutual fund company in America. I knew the  15  Finchum  Oehlschlager  Finchum  Oehlschlager  salesman  who  called on her so I talked to him about maybe going to  work for them and see if I could make a nickel. He put me in touch with  their district manager, etcetera. We talked and turns out the district  manager, about six  foot  six  inches tall  guy, had gone to Wharton two  years before I had. He knew kind of what I knew about the business  world and so I got a job.  Well, I can   t believe I was still so stupid that I didn   t know that in a  situation like that, generally, they had a rule that you could draw, let   s  say a week   s pay, and then pay it back out of commissions. Otherwise,  you went to work for nothing. In other words you worked strictly on  commissions. I didn   t know until years later I could   ve drawn, and I  mean I lived on nothing for a couple of years until I got started and then  I was going pretty good. It was all sales, and that was probably the  biggest jolt I had, that I was so dumb I didn   t know that that was going  on all the time. Anyway, that   s pretty much how that all wound up.  When I came to Oklahoma City I didn   t know anyone, didn   t have  anything, and   well I did. I had a friend who was an Episcopal priest  that I had become good friends with when he was in Cushing, which was  not far from Yale. I went to church there and Father Conley and I  became good friends and helped one another for a number of years.  Sounds like you were pretty good at risk taking.  (Laughs) Yeah. I don   t know. Well, I think I was more lucky than good.  It   s just the way the cards got dealt and you had to fling them the best  way you knew how.  And your wife and your children moved each time?  Well my first wife, the mother of my two boys, developed some kind of  personality problems. To make a long story short, she went to visit one  of her relatives down in Texas and something must   ve happened.  Anyway, she was put into a mental institution and after she came out she  was real docile. I had bought a little house up in Edmond on Twelfth  Street I remember, and we settled in there. One day she had a  myocardial infarction, which is instant death, when she was going into a  closet to get something. So she passed away then.  Then I wasn   t married for a few years and then I met a lady at church,  sang in the choir with me. We married and were married six years. She  had twins and two older boys, so she had four children. Her husband was  an alcoholic. She worked at the Medical Research Foundation as a  secretary there and went to church at the same Episcopal church I went  to in Edmond. Anyhow, we  were  married six years and then  16  Finchum  Oehlschlager  Finchum  Oehlschlager  Finchum  Oehlschlager  Finchum  Oehlschlager  Finchum  Oehlschlager  Finchum  Oehlschlager  Finchum  Oehlschlager  Finchum  Oehlschlager  Finchum  Oehlschlager   divorced .  How old were your two sons when their mother passed away?   Mid-twenties .  And then you met your current wife how?   Through a mutual friend.  We   ve been married forty years.  Forty?  Forty. Uh huh. I was sixty and she was thirty-three. Twenty-seven years   difference .  Forty years is pretty good   Well, it   s quite a span. (Laughs) You don   t know how much water   s  gone over the dam until you step back and look at it awhile. (Laughs)  Sure.  But my God  I can   t believe all that   s happened. (Laughs)  And I understand you took up golf again?  Yes, I played when I was in high school. I was on the golf team in  Kansas City. I just didn   t have time, didn   t have the money to take off  and play golf. So at sixty-nine I decided,    By gosh, it   s now or never.     (Laughs) So at sixty-nine I was well enough off where I could do that. I  played every day. I mean I played, and when I was seventy-one I shot  my age. Which is     That   s pretty good   Not a record, but I mean it   s something to   you know, you can say,     You ever shot your age?    (Laughs)    Yeah, once.     Did you usually walk or use a cart?  I rode mostly and then had to walk some. I was always active in some  fashion or other.  Sure.  Yeah.  17  Finchum  Oehlschlager  Finchum  Oehlschlager  Finchum  Oehlschlager  Finchum  Oehlschlager  Finchum  Oehlschlager  Finchum  Oehlschlager  Finchum  Oehlschlager  Finchum  Oehlschlager  And when was the last time you played a round?  You know that   s two connotations. (Laughter)  Well answer whichever one you want to do it   Now you   re delving into secrets. (Laughter) It   s been at least three or  four years.  Hard on the back to swing at this age.  Mmm?  Hard on the back?  No, it wasn   t hard on the back. It was just that I couldn   t hit the ball far  enough to make it worthwhile. I just made the decision to stop, and my  eyesight has deteriorated over the years. Today, right now, it   s very  difficult to read without my reader over there which multiplies it by  probably two or three   I think it   s five times. Prints that size, (gestures)  it   s five times bigger. It   s reading and anything to do with eyesight is not  one of my specialties anymore.  It   s a challenge.  I do read quite a bit with that thing but it takes a while.  What do you usually read?  Oh, I read good books and I read the financial pages and I read   that   s  about all.  Well, since we   re talking about that a little bit, describe a typical day for  us, now. What would a typical day be like?  Oh, for now?  Yes. How early would you get up?  I get up about seven thirty and then have breakfast. By eight thirty or  nine o    clock I   m usually ready to go. But I don   t go anywhere anymore,  usually. That   s okay. But on Thursdays we have a Thursday lunch bunch  and I   ve tried to make it   they   re not people that I normally pal around  with much. Well, I don   t pal around much with anybody, but this one  fellow, Steve Jones, is a   he   s kind of   he   s in a way a promoter and in  18  Finchum  Oehlschlager  Finchum  Oehlschlager  Finchum  Oehlschlager  Bishop  Oehlschlager  Finchum  Oehlschlager  Finchum  Oehlschlager  Finchum  Oehlschlager  a way I call him more of an entrepreneur type person. He   s the kind of a  fellow that I don   t know about   women and friends are different than  men and friends. Men friends are   it takes a certain kind of personality  to attract a number of men to get together and do something. This fellow  is that type of man. I   ve enjoyed   it   s something unusual in my life, but  I   ve enjoyed this particular individual. It   s amazing how many times  your life changes and the type of person that you   re attracted to and for  whatever reason.  So what time would you go to bed, if you get up at seven thirty?  Oh I probably go to bed around ten, ten thirty.  Pretty good.  Yeah. Usually I can go to sleep pretty well. If I can   t, I   ve come up with  a way to go to sleep without taking a sleeping pill or something. I get up,  go out in the kitchen and make myself a cup of hot chocolate, and eat a  graham cracker.  And that works?  Yeah  Yeah, by the time I   m through, I go to lie down and I go to sleep.  It just worked like that. (Laughs)  What do you attribute your longevity to?  Genes. I think there   s a lot of that. One of my mother   s sisters lived to be  104 and another one about 100. I think my father   s mother lived to be  ninety-six and you know, put all those together and it   s pretty     Well how old were your parents when they passed?  Well my parents, my dad was about seventy-two. He had a   you might  say, Alzheimer   s. I would say. They called it something else back then.  My mother was eighty-seven. My grandfather as I said   on my mother   s  side, there were a number of long life people. My father   s side the only  one I know about is my grandmother, his mother.  Is that German blood?  Oh, I guess. (Laughter)  What   s the biggest challenge you have today?  Today?  19  Finchum  Oehlschlager  Finchum  Oehlschlager  Finchum  Oehlschlager  Finchum  Oehlschlager  Finchum  Oehlschlager  Finchum  Oehlschlager  Finchum  Oehlschlager  Yeah, being one hundred what   s the     Oh, gosh. I don   t, I     The vision?  Vision is the big thing, but then there   s nothing you can do about it.  Something you can do about is what, you know, the things you   re  interested in and getting involved in them. I can   t do that anymore. I  mean I can   t go out and sponsor this or that. I can   t move around good  enough anymore. I think being able to navigate is my biggest problem.  And through the years you were active in the community.  I   ve always tried to be     So that would play into this too     Uh huh. Yeah. You know, I guess luckily I   ve lived in smaller  communities   well like Yale and Edmond years ago. (Laughs)  Well besides golf, what would you do for fun?   I was a gardener, always enjoyed being outside. I also participated in  civic clubs wherever I lived including Lions Club, Rotary and in  Norman I was active in the Chamber of Commerce. I   ve always been  interested in the arts as a patron as well as a participant. I have made  jewelry, painted in oils and sculpted.  I like music but   and hadn   t  thought anything about dancing for a while. I enjoyed dancing. Mhmm,  yeah. I enjoy people who have a different lifestyle than mine. I enjoy  hearing episodes of their life, what they   re doing   contemplating doing.  Well you have a circle of friends too, obviously. He brings you     Well, yeah Mark     Brings you dessert.  Yeah. Mark is a    (laughs) he   s a kind of a business associate you might  say, but he   s become a good friend. Because of the nature of my  business life, it has restricted my activities with people of my own age  and my own characteristics, in other words. I don   t fraternize a lot with  people who are big party goers and that sort of thing. I just don   t have  the nature. I don   t have anything against it, but it   s just not my nature to  do whatever they call    partying.    (Laughter) If they like to do it, it   s  20  Bishop  Oehlschlager  Finchum  Oehlschlager  Finchum  Oehlschlager  Finchum  Oehlschlager  Finchum  Oehlschlager  Finchum  Oehlschlager  great.  Do you have a philosophy or a motto that you live by in life?  I don   t know that I could put it in words Alex. It   s   I try to be a builder.  I think I get that from having lived in smaller towns and if you don   t do  something, nothing will get done. That   s one of the keystones of a small  town. You have opportunity to do something that ordinarily you  wouldn   t have. That, I like about it. Most people wouldn   t care much for  small town life but as I said, when you   re in that situation, if you don   t  do it, it ain   t going to get done. (Laughter) You know, in other words  that   s all there is.  I read somewhere you did Town and Gown  Community Theater  in  Stillwater.  I did.  You want to talk a little bit about that?  I did for about three or four years   I was trying to think of that gal   s  name that was head of the drama department at OSU.  That would   ve been about in the fifties     Uh, it would be the sixties.  Sixties, while you were living in Yale.  Yes, mhmm, yeah. It would be before    65.  And did you act or did you help with     Yeah, yeah, I acted. I did other things, whatever needed doing but  mostly I acted. My first play (laughs) was a Tennessee Williams play. I  had a very small part, but as I went along I got bigger parts and I had a  couple of leads. One time   I think my first lead was  The Madwoman of  Chaillot  by  Jean Giraudoux .  Anyway, I was living in Yale. We still had the drugstore. Let   s see   this  was opening night, and I just felt real sick to my stomach. Anyway, I  had a cold, and so I remember going into the drugstore and Elsie the  pharmacist wasn   t there at the moment. I went over and got a bottle  of   I forgot what it was but there wasn   t a lot left in it, and I don   t know  how old it was. Anyway, I took a tablespoon of it and it liked to have  killed me. (Laughs) I didn   t know if I was going to go on that night or  21  Bishop  Oehlschlager  Finchum  Oehlschlager  Bishop  Oehlschlager  Finchum  Oehlschlager  Bishop  Oehlschlager  Finchum  Oehlschlager  Finchum  not. They told me later it should   ve been thrown out five years ago or  something. I never did anything like that again, never touched a bottle of  anything in that pharmacy. (Laughs)  But the show went on.  Yeah, the show went on. I was so sick and I went over there and one of  the other leads was a doctor from Perkins, and his wife was the director  of the play. I told them about it and she said,    Man, you   re lucky to be  alive.    (Laughs) Funny how it was one of those unfortunate dumb things  I did.  And that was before there were regulations that would have prevented  you from doing it.  Yeah, right. (Laughter) Well, anything you can think of, that I can   t  think of, I   ll try to recall.  Did you ever think you   d make it to one hundred?  No. Never even gave it a thought, Alex. Just all of a sudden, and I don   t  know how many times I   ve wondered in the last year or so, where did  the last nine years go? I can hardly remember living these last nine  years. I don   t know what happened.  Time flies.  Yeah, it just   all of a sudden and I said,    Where have they gone?     And did you do anything special for your hundredth birthday?  Oh, gosh yeah. J.C. put on a wingding you wouldn   t believe. It was in  the paper and well, there   s a copy of the thing. It went in the paper. A  friend of ours put it on the wall over there if you want to look at it. She  put on the biggest party. My birthday was Sunday April 13. She had  rented three ballrooms at the Embassy Suites here and we had a   sort of  an open house from two to five. My God, I   d never seen so many  people. (Laughter) Well, free food and drinks. What do you expect? But  no, it was quite a shindig. She is a great hostess.  Do you have anything left on your bucket list you want to do?  On my bucket list?  On your bucket list.  22  Oehlschlager  Finchum  Oehlschlager  Finchum  Oehlschlager  Bishop  Oehlschlager  Bishop  Oehlschlager  Finchum  Oehlschlager  Finchum  Oehlschlager  Finchum  Oehlschlager  Finchum  Oh not really, Tanya. Due to physical impediments I   d say, it   s just I  don   t feel free to dream a whole lot about physical things like going  somewhere or doing something physical. It   s evidently not my nature,   to do that . If you can   t, don   t do it.  Don   t do it.  (Laughs) Don   t worry about it.  Well the Senior Open was just in Edmond so that would   ve been     Yeah, oh yeah. I went to one of those years ago. Yeah, that   s a great  event for Oak Tree to have that here.  When history is written what do you want it to say about you?  (Laughs) Oh, my gosh.  That   s a big question.  Oh yeah it is. Well, I don   t know. All I can say is,    He was here a  hundred years and he gave it all he had.    I really benefited I think, more  than I gave. I   ve had so many lives that you can   t   you can never   you  just can   t quibble with that. There   s something about having lived that  long and experienced that much. There   s always something that comes  up to remind you of something good that happened to you. There   s  always something like that happening.  And you   ve moved around so much, where do you consider home?  Oh, I   d say Kansas City  Missouri  and Norman  Oklahoma . Yeah, I   ve  lived   I   ve almost forgotten the ten years I lived in  New England . So  much has happened since then. It   s kind of crowded it out.  But the years in Yale are alive and well.  Yes. Yale (laughs) was an experience, believe me.  I can   t imagine all that     I mean, when I look back on it I think,    That is certainly not what one  would expect from someone with your background.    (Laughs) Having  been born in Kansas City and went to Wharton, wound up in Yale.  (Laughs)  Yale, and owned half of it   23  Oehlschlager  Finchum  Oehlschlager  Finchum  Oehlschlager  Bishop  Oehlschlager  Finchum  Oehlschlager  Finchum  Oehlschlager  Finchum  Oehlschlager  Finchum  Oehlschlager  Finchum  Oehlschlager  Finchum  Oehlschlager  Yeah  (Laughs) I mean, it   s so incongruous that it just baffles me.  Are those buildings still standing?  Most of them.  Are they?  There   s one building, I think, next to the   maybe one up from the  drugstore, that burned. It was the movie theater I think. But other than  that I think they   re all standing. Last time I was there.  The pharmacy   s still there.  Drugstore   s still there.  Well do you think your being married to a younger woman has  contributed to this long life?  It   s very possible, yeah. I really don   t know much about the   that type  of thing. If you reason it out, it makes sense.  Yeah, certainly hadn   t hurt.  I mean, I   ve had to stay younger most of my life. Yeah, so I   d have to  agree with you that it makes a difference.  Well do you have a favorite memory?  A favorite memory?  Yeah, one or two?  Nah.  Highlights of your life?  I think   I don   t really think so. I mean, they   re all   so many of them  are just outstanding to me, anyway.  You have great fortitude.  Well, yeah. Imagine it   s a matter of having to. (Laughs) You don   t have  a choice, unless you like death. (Laughter) And I don   t. I don   t really  worry about death very much. Whenever I   m talking to God   oh say  24  Finchum  Oehlschlager  Finchum  Oehlschlager  Finchum  Oehlschlager  Finchum  Oehlschlager  Finchum  maybe a friend of mine died, you know,    Why pick on him. Look at me.  I   m not worth a bucket of spit and here you take this guy who   s in the  prime of life and blah, blah, blah,    you know. I just kind of hear God  say,    It   s none of your damn business.    (Laughter)  He   s not done with you yet.  No, he sure is not. Now I keep asking him,    What? What do you want?  What haven   t I given yet?    Anyway, that   s just between us.  Well if there   s not anything else you want to add, we   ll sign off.  Okay, anything more you want to ask?  I think you   re getting tired, so thank you very much for sharing with us.  You   re very welcome, Tanya.  Been a pleasure.  Thank you for taking the time and picking me.  Oh, you   re great.  -------  -------
