 Nykolaiszyn  P. McElroy  My name is Juliana Nykolaiszyn with the Oklahoma State University  Library. Today is Tuesday April 16, 2013, and I   m in Stillwater,  Oklahoma, interviewing Steven McElroy and Patricia McElroy as part  of the O-STATE Stories Oral History Project. Thank you so much, both  of you, for joining us today. Well, let   s begin. First I   d like to learn a  little bit more about you, and then we   re going to talk a little bit more  about your family connection to OSU. Patricia, could you start off and  tell us where you were born and the year you were born, and tell me a  little bit about your parents?  I was born in 1950, August 11, in Norman, Oklahoma. My parents, at  the time, they managed an apartment complex, and my recollection is it  was, at that time, right across the street from the OU golf course. The  only reason why I know I that is because we had golf balls that ended up  in the front yards all the time. I don   t think my mother worked at the  time, other than managing out of that office, nor my father. I think he  just did maintenance to take care of the buildings. How they got there, I  don   t know. We moved as a family back here to Stillwater when I was  three or four (that would   ve been 1953,    54) and moved into a house  about a quarter of a mile from C. H. McElroy   s house. I could walk, you  know, as I got older, could walk to their house and often did ride my  bike there. When we moved, my mother got a job at the university. Do  you want me to go into that?  Her first job was in animal husbandry in a beautiful building. She  worked for   I can   t tell you the professor, but he was in charge of  Herefords, so it was cows. She got really good at knowing about cows.  Then she transferred to the Dairy Department and was still with cows,  but they were doing different things. Then, finally, she ended up at the  Athletic Department which is where she retired from, first as the  secretary for the football coach and the assistant athletic director, and  then she retired as administrative assistant to the athletic director for  OSU. My father, when they moved here, I assume had his same job all  5  Nykolaiszyn  S. McElroy  P. McElroy  S. McElroy  P. McElroy  S. McElroy  P. McElroy  S. McElroy  P. McElroy  S. McElroy  of his life here in Stillwater. He was the supervisor for buildings and  grounds for OSU Athletic Department. He stayed in that job until he  retired.  Wow. All right, Steven if you could tell us the year you were born and a  little bit about your parents.  Well, I was born in 1957 in Los Angeles, California. My father, Buel  McElroy Jr., was the son of Buel McElroy Sr., Granddaddy Mac, we  always called him, and as a young child we   d come back to Stillwater to  visit. By that time they were living out McElroy Road out there.  Well no. We were out on Sixth Street, were we not?  Right.  Yes, which is the residence I referred to that   s like a quarter of a mile  from C. H.  Some of my earliest childhood memories were with my Granddaddy  Mac, coming down to the campus at night. For some reason he had to  come down on business, and, like I was telling Pam, he had this  keychain that seemed like it had a thousand keys on it. It would be dark  in the buildings. He   d have a little flashlight, and he   d show me how he  had these different rings in between the sets of keys, and that   s how he  could tell at night which key set he was using to get in the different  doors. Just had really fascinating and wonderful memories of my  Granddaddy Mac.  So go back to your father.  My father, I guess he was very close with Dean  Clarence H.  Mac.  Apparently he spent some time being raised by his grandmother and  grandfather. I remember visiting as a child C. H.   s house, (we always  called him C. H.) and he was just a very tall and very formidable man to  me, very quiet spoken. As a five-year-old kid, that   s mostly what I  remember about him. I do remember when he passed, (we decided it was  1970) my father was very, very affected by that. He wasn   t talking about  it. He didn   t talk much about his feelings. I remember he flew back for  the funeral, and it was a very somber time in our family   s life.  Your mother?  Mother and my father met while they were going to school here, as I  understand, and they moved to California about two years before I was  born. My older brother is two years older than me. He was born in  6  Nykolaiszyn  P. McElroy  Oklahoma. Loved my mom. She did a real good job raising us kids for  many years, and in her later years lived out her dream. Moved to Napa  into the house that I   m living now on Main Street, and became the artist.  Did artwork for the rest of her life. That was always her dream, so, good  for you, Mom.  Well, we   re sitting here today in McElroy Hall, here at the OSU Center  for Veterinary Health Sciences, and let   s talk a little bit about what you  remember or what you can recall about Dean McElroy.  Well, I guess they babysat me often because I grew up with parents that  both worked, which back in that time I think was rare. When I look back  on it and look at my friends, most of them, their mothers, did not work. I  always remember my father had a much more relaxed job, I guess you   d  say, so he seemed like he could get off at any time. He would get off and  pick me up from work. During the week, most of the time I would spend  at home, but on weekends sometimes, I would go to my grandparents   .  Granddaddy had a fairly large piece of property on Sixth Street. I  couldn   t tell you how many acres, but it was acreage, and he had a farm.  He had pigs. He had chickens. Eventually I got a couple of horses, and  those horses stayed there at some time.  One of my fondest memories was when the pig was pregnant. I would  get a phone call that   d say,    Okay, come. It   s time.    Begrudgingly, my  father would drive me down, and I would watch as the piglets were born.  I loved all of that, and it was great fun. My grandfather, in the process,  I   m sure, taught me a lot about that process and how it worked and what  happens. As you   re growing up, you learn the, I guess, lessons of life  because when a sow, as big as they are, when they want to lay down,  they can   t stop themselves, so there were many piglets that ended up  under the mom. That was part of what I learned. As much as that was,     Oh no, that   s so sad,    I remember my grandfather explaining,    That   s  just what happens.    They have lots of piglets, so I don   t know if that   s  part of nature   s way of making sure that they maintain the herd by  having so many.  I also remembered he would go out and feed the chickens, and I never  was great on putting my hand in a nest with a chicken laying to get eggs.  We always had fresh eggs. That was one thing. I did help him, especially  in the summer, clean the eggs. How I did this, I don   t remember. Figure  out whether it was a large egg or whether it was a medium egg, and all  that Grade A, Double A kind of thing. We had to do that. Then we  would take the eggs in cartons to a store that I think it was on Knoblock,  but I   m not sure. Not there anymore. He would sell his eggs there.  People would buy Dean Mac   s fresh chicken eggs.  7  S. McElroy  P. McElroy  The interesting thing, I remember one time when I was little I had   I  think when kids are little, they wear tennis shoes of different colors. I  think we   ve gotten more sophisticated now and it   s going to be white or  they have little sparklies on them. Well, I had red tennis shoes on one  day. I must   ve been five or six, and it was a sunny day. I remember that  my grandfather was out spraying feed out for the chickens to come out  into the yard to eat. The chickens, instead of going toward the feed  starting coming toward me. They weren   t doing it aggressively, but they  were definitely deliberately coming. I was just standing there and  watching my grandfather in the distance. Then he said    Get out of the  yard        Okay.    There was a gate right behind me. It was right by the  garage, and so I got out of the yard. Well, he informed me, as the vet he  was, that the chickens who are basically colorblind have learned that red  for them is blood, and so they were coming after fresh meat. (Laughs)  They didn   t care about the feed that was down there. This was more  enticing. Man, I took a hike  It was one of my lessons, don   t wear red  around chickens, so I never did     Cute.     again. I did wear red when I was younger, and when I got older I  learned not to. I do remember that was like,    Okay.    The other thing, he  had a pond on that property, and every once in a while they   d stock it.  He and I would go fishing, and he kept cane poles in the garage. The  garage had open beams. Because they were long, very long, he would  keep them up there. I   d come over, and we   d go down to the pond and  fish. He had his cane pole, I had my cane pole, and we would fish. Also,  he had a large garden, and he loved to plant corn and green beans.  Grandmother used to sit there and pop the peas, pop them out. I could  see her on the back stoop with a bowl, popping those in there.  Then the whole family   my father had a sister, and she had two sons  who are still living. When she got married, she became a Blankenship.  Her first name was Geraldine. All the women, my grandmother, and my  mother, and my aunt, the womenfolk would be in the kitchen, and my  grandfather and I would be out in the garden pulling the ears of corn. We  would take it to my father who was sitting on the edge of his truck on  the front yard, and he would peel off the silks and take the worms out  because that was the other thing that you have in corn. Then  the corn   would go inside, and they   d get blanched. It was a whole thing that we  did every season. After everything was done, they would divvy it up and  put them in plastic bags, and the whole family would take the corn to the  various houses. I remember doing that faithfully every season with my  grandfather, getting that corn.  The other neat thing, he had a strawberry patch that was on a path of a  8  S. McElroy  P. McElroy  Nykolaiszyn  P. McElroy  S. McElroy  P. McElroy  sidewalk that led from the back door to the garage. The way it was  planted, it was in a round thing, and right in the middle, it was empty. As  a little child, I would get the hose, I   d sit in the middle, and I   d wash off  the strawberries and eat them sitting right there. I guess it was my  strawberry patch.  And the strawberries would get water.  Yes, very memorable. At least I knew to wash them. Those were some  really cool things that I used to do. Granddaddy also was pretty up with  the politics of the city. He may have run for something, but I don   t really  remember. He would meet a bunch of guys that were also pillars of the  city. There   s a local caf   down on Main Street, and I   m not real sure  what I did. That   s not a recollection I remember. He would go to  morning coffee, and that was a very common thing. He would do it  during the week, too, but if I was in school, obviously I wasn   t with him.  On weekends, Saturdays, I remember getting in the big black car which  was a Ford, (they both had matching Ford cars) getting in that car, and  we would go down to that caf  . I would sit there, and they would talk. I  had no idea what they were talking about. I would have my little coffee  or milk or whatever, but I did that a lot with him. That was a very  common exercise for the two of us to do.  Would you have chores when you would visit?  No, it   s still the same about going to grandparents   .  Eating strawberries. (Laughter)  Yes, I mean, I remember I would get a Coke. They had the little, the  short little Cokes. I would be allowed to go to the refrigerator and get a  Coke. I do remember the big thing was doing the   I guess the chores in  a way were doing the eggs and that kind of stuff, and that was pretty  ongoing. I would help feed the pigs, but Granddaddy was right there. I  really don   t ever remember doing it on my own. I do remember it was  neat because he had a barn, and he had a feed room. It was a pretty  sturdy door that had that feed in it. He   d open the door, and you   d  smell   I know smells are a real important thing for memories. He had  these bins, and the bins had different feed in it for the different animals.  That would hit you, and that was a wonderful smell. I would go down to  the mill, which obviously is still present, and help him get feed  sometimes.  I don   t know what the feed comes in now, but they came in cotton bags.  My grandmother would take those and make pillowcases and stuff, and I  still have some of that. She would embroider, make them fancier, and  9  S. McElroy  P. McElroy  Nykolaiszyn  P. McElroy  S. McElroy  P. McElroy  she would do that often. We   ve got dishtowels and some, well mostly  dishtowels, that were made out of those old feed sacks because they  were good material. I do remember going down to the feed store, to the  mill and getting feed. There were different things. It just depended on  what time of year it was and what he needed, and we would go. I did do  a lot of that.  I did go on vacation with him a couple of times, just he and I, when I  was older. We took a train to   where   d we go? Kansas City, I think.  First time I ever was on a train, that was cool. Those are the  recollections. He didn   t take me too much to school with him, to the  university. Now, he did, my father. There are stories about him taking  my father, and I think my father spent a lot more time, obviously. I  wasn   t around at his work. I know my father saw some pretty gross,  gruesome things that were just part of the learning process at the vet  school. I think they used to do experiments on chickens, and so my  father would not eat chicken. He wouldn   t eat turkey, either. I think that  was just a transfer. I don   t think they were working on turkeys. It took a  long time for my mother to finally convince my father that  turkey   really is okay.    You can eat this.    She used to sneak it in     Wow, interesting.     in a dish, and he wouldn   t know what it was. He wouldn   t eat it. He  would not eat chicken or turkey. When he   d go to these banquets and  stuff, which he didn   t do often, inevitably they would have chicken on  the menu. We didn   t have the selections we have now, so he wouldn   t  eat it. (Laughs)  Any more remembrances of your grandmother? What did she do? Did  she have an occupation?  Well, that   s interesting. The book of this     There   s a picture of her in the book right here. Maggie.  It kind of reminded me of what a military wife   if the military guy was  the head of the unit for the military, the wives would get together. Well,  that   s what they did. I think that   s what my grandmother did because  first he was the dean of the vet school, and then he became dean of men.  He got more involved at a higher level with more involvement with the  university, and so I think her role greatly was to deal with the wives of  whomever. I think she did a lot of that. I only saw her at home. We  never really did much together other than at home. I was just a little kid  who was running around the house.  10  Nykolaiszyn  P. McElroy  Nykolaiszyn  S. McElroy  P. McElroy  S. McElroy  P. McElroy  S. McElroy  P. McElroy  S. McElroy  P. McElroy  How old were you when he passed away?  I was a sophomore in college. It was midterms. I remember that. He   d  been sick in the hospital for a little while, and my sophomore year was  not a wonderful year. You   re taking all of those courses you have to take  that you really don   t care about. You have to take them, but they   re not  my major. I finally got into my major, which was a much better world  for me. So you   re taking all those courses, like big classes of history  where everybody doesn   t know you   re name. When he died, they closed  the university for the day, which I was just floored about. No classes  were held that day, which was a pretty impressive thing from my  standpoint.  My friends kept saying,    You need to call your professors and see if you  can get extensions on your tests.    I took some of them, but I did finally  call a couple of them. They said,    I   ve been waiting for you to call,     which I thought was very nice of them. I said,    Could I have a couple of  days before       I certainly wasn   t lying about why I needed the  extension. It was all over the place. The Daily Oklahoman had a big   article , and it was on the news. It was a pretty big deal. I guess you  realize that when this happens how much of a big deal he was. It was  like,    Whoa.    I was here, and it was a pretty big deal to say the least.  Well, Steven, let   s talk about some of your memories as a little boy.  Sure. Well, it   s funny to hear her talk about her grandfather taking her  out to collect the eggs, feed the chickens, check on the horses because  you did the same thing with us on the old ranch. Must have sunk in     It must have.     because that   s one of those things I remember.  I was a little bit older, so     Yes she was.  Kind of a big sister.  She would take us fishing. All of these things you   re talking about, you  did the same thing with us kids when we came to visit, so those are  really great memories for me. Gosh, there   s so much   And you know what sparked this was when we walked in, I showed him  a picture of     11  S. McElroy  P. McElroy  S. McElroy  P. McElroy  S. McElroy  P. McElroy  S. McElroy  P. McElroy  S. McElroy  P. McElroy  S. McElroy  P. McElroy  S. McElroy  P. McElroy  S. McElroy  Yes      Max, and Max is     Max McElroy is        let   s see. The relationship, he   s a cousin.  He   s C. H.   s brother   s son.  Son, right. Granddaddy had a brother whose name was Emmett, who  stayed in Creek County which is where they kind of landed. When you  looked at the two of them, he looked very Indian: black hair, high  cheekbones. Granddaddy got the Irish-Scotch with the red hair and the  freckles, but they were definitely brothers. He ran an old-timey trading  post over in Creek County.  You   re talking about Emmett.  Emmett. Great place to go when you were a kid. He had a son, Max,  who ended up going to school here and became a vet, and he graduated  in 1956. That   s what started this conversation, because he started talking  about     And that   s where I   d like to interject. We always called him Cousin  Max, but he   s actually my father   s cousin, right?  Yes, it would make you a second cousin.  Right. He had a veterinary practice right up on Ventura Boulevard in  Thousand Oaks, I think it was, in north Hollywood there, and we loved  to visit Cousin Max. He always had a story to tell. He was quite a  character. He was a wonderful man. When she showed me his  photograph here, (graduating class of    56, you said it was?)     Yes.     I was just floored because he was so young looking. He had his own  set of really very interesting stories. Being in that area just below the  Hollywood Hills, he was the veterinary for all the stars. I remember one  of the last get-togethers our family had. He invited all us McElroys over  to his house. I think it was for Thanksgiving one year.  Not us. We were here     Yes, she was still here but     12  P. McElroy  S. McElroy  P. McElroy  S. McElroy  Nykolaiszyn  S. McElroy  P. McElroy     so it was all the McElroys out in California.     the California McElroys went out and had Thanksgiving. Max had so  many stories about the Hollywood stars and whatnot. One of the things I  thought was interesting was his story about Marilyn Monroe. Apparently  he had an appointment with her to have lunch, I think, the very day she  turned up dead. He seemed to think that was pretty fishy. Anyways, back  to McElroys, I discovered most of my information sort of after the fact  when I started getting into genealogy as an adult. I started getting  curious about the McElroy name and tried to trace it back. This is when I  discovered all the lineage of C. H. being part Indian.  Which I already knew.  She already knew all this. I had no idea. As a child, I can only remember  from about the age of five on, I just had this love of the country, this  love of the land. I joined the Boy Scouts because they would always go  camping and be close to nature. Then when I discovered this Indian  connection, to me it made sense because I felt like that   s the part of my  family that drove me to be like that. It   s in the blood. I   ve always had a  very close love of nature and animals. I think I got that through him, so I  attribute a lot of my love of nature and animals to C. H. because I truly  believe that   s where I got all that.  Would you come back to Stillwater often?  Yes, we would. I think it sort of tapered off once C. H. passed on.  Honestly, I graduated high school in    75, so I was off on my own,  finding my own way. Like I said, I knew from an early age that I didn   t  want to be in the city. I would use every excuse I could to get out of  there. In fact, I would spend summers with   my neighbors across the  street had grandparents up in the Central Valley over in San Joaquin.  They had a big orange orchard. Well, that was the country, so they  would invite me to come up with them. I don   t know how my parents  felt about that, but they let me do it.  Now, I really only recall one time that they came, vividly. I know that  they came more often. I remember his parents going to Oklahoma City  to see something, and so my parents babysat all the boys because the  girls   he has a younger sister. She wasn   t here yet. We had a tornado  that came through, and we had to evacuate to a shelter. I remember I  have a picture of Bryce, asleep, kind of wide-eyed like    What   s going  on?    We ran two doors down from the house to a storm shelter and  stayed down in there. I thought,    Oh, what a night for the parents to be  gone and the grandparents having to take care of all the kids    in all that  13  S. McElroy  P. McElroy  S. McElroy  P. McElroy  S. McElroy  P. McElroy  S. McElroy  P. McElroy  S. McElroy  P. McElroy  Nykolaiszyn  P. McElroy  S. McElroy  episode of happening.  My grandmother also lived out here, and she ran that hotel.  Not the same grandmother.  This is from a different part of the family, my mom   s side. We would  come spend summers here. I think that was over in Norman     Yes, there were several hotels.     was a hotel that she ran.  One of the interesting things was his mother, Yvonne, my sister-in-law.  When I was little, not knowing the terminology, I used to tell the sisters   religious nuns , the teachers, that my brother married my sister.  Needless to say, that got a lot of attention. (Laughter) I didn   t quite  understand. I   ve since learned. I caught on. I said    Well, I don   t  understand.       Well, that   s not possible.    Really, I loved my sister-in-law.  Found out when she started going to school (I   m sure you know  this) she wanted to go into art because she was a very good artist, and  her father wouldn   t let her. She ended up in textile     Fashion design, I think.  Yes, fashion design, which she had a very good eye for, and later years  had     Boutiques, she opened her own boutiques.     boutiques. She   s very good at that, but she always went back to her  art. It was a big deal. He was not going to support her tuition if she went  into the art stuff     Wow.     so she kind of had to compromise.  She always wanted to go to New York and drink coffee and smoke  cigarettes and things like that. That side of my family got us back to  Oklahoma lots of times. As kids, we were always wanting to go to  Frontier City and do the fun things, swim in the pool. Let   s see. I  remember being out here one trip, and this was sort of a traumatic  experience. My sister, I know she was four. She had her fourth birthday  here in Norman, I believe it was, and she came down with diabetes.  14  P. McElroy  S. McElroy  Nykolaiszyn  S. McElroy  Nykolaiszyn  P. McElroy  Nykolaiszyn  P. McElroy  That   s when she got real sick.  That   s when she got sick. I remember my mother and my sister flying  back to Los Angeles to get her in the hospital, and my dad piling my  brother and me in his old Corvair, and we bee-lined it back for  California. We didn   t even stop at the house first. We went straight to  that hospital. I remember along the way, (and this is what I was going to  tell you earlier) we had a blowout. It was scary as heck for my dad, and I  always remember looking at the tire and thinking,    Oh, shredded  wheat     (Laughter) I was telling you earlier I was looking at my tire and  noticing it was bald on my motorcycle, and that   s where my brain keeps  going back to, as a child, that blowout. I   m going to have my tire  changed before I leave for California.  That   s good because we do not want any shredded wheat on the road.  No more shredded wheat, especially with a motorcycle.  Well, when you think about your family, talk to me about how you hope  your family legacy is viewed here at Oklahoma State.  Well, I will tell you, the interesting thing was that   I moved away from  here after I graduated, went down to Louisiana. I came back because my  parents were still here, but never really otherwise. I remember I made a  donation to the vet school, you know, when the OSU callers call. They  always want me to give it to this. I said,    No, I want to give it to the vet  school.    I always do that. They always have to make sure they change  everything they   ve got in front of them. I made a donation. It was not  that big, but I got a letter from the dean   s office, which I   m sure  everybody got a letter from the dean   s office. It wasn   t anything big, but  I looked at it and went,    Oh, okay.    I looked at the return address, and it  said McElroy Hall. I went,    Huh, okay.    I called the number on the  letter, because it was letterhead stationery. I called and got the secretary  for the dean, and it was Dean  Lorenz  at the time. I   m not sure that   s his  name.   Michael  Lorenz?  Lorenz, thank you. I knew I was getting the wrong letter. Of course, I   d  not met him or anything, but I talked to the secretary. She didn   t know  who I was, and I said,    Is this the dean   s office?    She says,    Yes,    and I  said,    Could you tell me where your office is located?    She said,    Well,  it   s in the McElroy Hall Building.    I said,    Could you tell me when that  became the McElroy Hall Building?    because I didn   t have a clue  She  says,    Oh, about three years ago.    I went,    Oh, okay.    Then I told her  who I was, and she went,    Oh.    See, my aunt, my father   s sister, lived  15  here and died here, but she had Blankenship as her last name. If they  didn   t know, I   m sure they just kind of lost that process, and so they  didn   t know where any of the family was. I guess they never reached out  to try to get any. I was oblivious to the fact that this building got  renamed, so I went,    Oh, okay.     Well, one thing led to another, and I think we got ahold of the  development people from that conversation and then the thing with the  award. I said,    Are you people still giving that award out?       Yes.    I  said,    Well, why don   t I come sometime, and I   ll go to the banquet.     That   s what started that, so I   ve been doing it maybe the last six years or  so. Sometimes I   d miss because work just wasn   t conducive for me to  get off for four days to come up here. That was a pleasant surprise.  I will tell you the other thing. When I was younger, I got on this kick  because McElroy Road has been McElroy Road since before I was born.  I noticed as I got older and little more savvy to politics that Streets run  one way in this city, and Drives run another way. Then you have  McElroy Road. I started doing some investigating to find out,    Why is it  called    Road   ? Why isn   t it called a Drive like every other street?    I  ended up at the fire station, the head fire station, with their maps and  everything.    Oh, well, can you see it   s an extension here?       That   s fine,  but it   s not named right.    I could never figure out to go to whoever  needed to rename it because I thought it needed to be renamed. It still  doesn   t make sense to me. That was one thing I tried to do as a citizen of  the town, and that didn   t happen. (Laughs)  Then as I was growing up, of course my friends knew my grandfather  mainly because their parents knew. He was big at the YMCA. He was on  the board. When I was probably still in junior high I got a job there. I   m  sure he got it for me. I was a lifeguard, sort of. I took the baskets for the  people to put their stuff in, and so I spent a couple of summers at the Y.  Loved it. I was a little water baby. My grandmother, I remember, started  to get sick the end of the first summer. I don   t really know. My mother  always thought she had diabetes, but that never came out. She would  wander, and we   d have to find her. She didn   t wander far, but it was like  she just didn   t know where she was. I do remember that there was (in  fact, I think I have it) a portrait of my grandfather that was at the Y. I  went there to see it or something, and they didn   t have it up anymore,  and they didn   t want to have it up. I said,    Okay.    They gave it to me, so  I said    Okay, I   ll take that.     I started going around making sure that if there were portraits up they  were still up, or,    Nope.    That   s the only one I found, and I do have it at  the house. It   s not in great condition; it needs to be reframed. I did that.  A lot of times for me, when people met me, it   s like,    Oh, you   re Dean  16  Nykolaiszyn  S. McElroy  P. McElroy  S. McElroy  McElroy   s grandchild,    and so I got that a lot as I was growing up. I  kind of felt bad for my father because I never was his daughter. I was  more my grandfather   s grandchild. One of the reasons why I left home  for a little while (I went to school down in Dallas) was to get away from  that. I would think that sometimes it   s common. I didn   t want to be  anybody   s grand-anything. I just wanted to be me. It wasn   t a bad thing  to be who I was, but it was just I kind of wanted to try for my own  identity over time. It   s nice now to come back, although a lot of those  people aren   t around anymore, which is why we do this kind of thing.  Right. Anything to add, Steven?  Well, yes, I have a lot to add. Your question was how we would like our  family   s legacy to be remembered. As I   ve stated, I didn   t know much  about my family until I was an adult and started getting into genealogy,  but I always knew things that struck me. Like I was gardener at a ranch  for many years in the Napa Valley and spent a lot of time up in the hills,  and there happened to be a Native American settlement out there. I   d go  comb the vineyards. There were vineyards at the time, and I   d find  things like this. I always remember it being like gold to me, being out  hiking and finding a big beautiful hawk feather or something. Those  things were magic to me.  Like I said, I didn   t find out until later that my granddaddy was part  Indian. It   s no secret that the Indians were very close to the earth and  nature and wildlife, giving thanks for their meals to the animals that  they   ve killed and whatnot. I believe that C. H.   s love and that sort of  blood through his veins attracted him towards this veterinary sort of way  of life. The love of animals, the love of caring for animals, that type of  thing, it seems to me that it plays into that whole Native American blood  connection. I would like the McElroy family legacy to be sort of the  connection to the earth and the animals on a sort of Native American  level.  Yes, and I kind of can reflect that, too, in that I really wanted to get that,  not recognition, but the paperwork of the Native American. I had a letter  that my grandfather had written that had his tribal number on it, which is  very helpful when you have it. I connected with Steve later and indicated  that I had that information and had the form that I used to get my card  from the Bureau of Indian Affairs, and then connected with the Creeks  which is the tribe for the family. I have that, and I tease people that I   m a  card-carrying Native American. There aren   t a lot of them anymore, and  first generation removed from people on the rolls. Grandfather was on  the rolls, and you can see it when you go into the Dawes.  You can go right online and see his signature.  17  P. McElroy  S. McElroy  P. McElroy  That kind of thing today is so rare. It   s even rarer in Louisiana. I mean,  they   ve got a couple of tribes, but it   s like you   re pretty much not there.  Growing up knowing about the civilized tribes   and, of course, that was  part of Oklahoma History, and you had to take that course in junior high.  From that standpoint I think it   s important from my point of view. It  never really was something that Granddaddy talked about, although  obviously he had that connection and he knew it. Then you knew it  when you went and saw his brother, as I said, and the trading post, and  I   m sure he had stories. Max probably would have had great stories from  that standpoint. Max was much older from me, so I wasn   t privy to that  information.  I did and have taken up the Indian flute as part of my Indian heritage. so  I have done that. I   m now the proud owner of two of those. They   re not  cheap, and I had one which was fairly large. LSU  Louisiana State  University  has a leisure class process, and you can take courses that last  like six weeks, twelve weeks, something like that. They had one for  Native American flutes, so I went,    Oh, good     I enrolled. One other  person enrolled. Well, there wasn   t enough to make the class. I got ahold  of the people who were having the class, and I said,    Could you let me  know who the person is?    I had recently retired, so I had some time, and  I thought maybe I could take some private lessons. Well, it turned out  the lady who was teaching the class lived four blocks away from me in  my neighborhood. This just was meant to be.  Neat   I mean, she owned thirty of them. When I walked in, she had all these  flutes. I said,    Okay,    and I have my measly little one. She said    Well, I  think you need to get one that   s smaller for your hands.    She  recommended that I get another one, so I did. Well, the guy who makes  them, the one I got, lives in Dallas. I just got an email from them  because they were going to be at some festival in Florida. I wrote back,  and I said,    I appreciate the fact that you keep me informed with going  to this, but I own two flutes, and that   s probably one more than I ever  thought I would own.    She wrote back, and she says,    Well, they   re kind  of like chocolate. Once you taste them you want more.    I said,    Well,  let   s hope it doesn   t turn into chocolate,    because, as I said, they   re very  expensive. It   s like,    Okay, I   m not sure I   m going too far with this.     The other thing I did do with the Native American, I did as a treat for  me. It was on my bucket list. I was in Washington DC at the opening of  the Native American Museum, and a friend of mine and I went up there.  First of all, the number of Indians was incredible, all in native garb,  although I was in jeans. It was so fascinating, and to be there on the  18  Nykolaiszyn  P. McElroy  Nykolaiszyn  P. McElroy  Nykolaiszyn  P. McElroy  grounds with all of these Native Americans everywhere that day, it was  really impressive. I have since gone back to the museum several times  and am a charter member of the  museum  board. I really did try to get  into those roots and have continued to do that as much as I can.  I have a cypress tree in my backyard. One of the things I just did, there  was a guy who was having to clear some land, and he had a saw. I said,     Would you cut off one of these?    He thought I wanted him to cut off all  the cypress, and,    Oh no, no, just one.    I picked this one because I   m  going to make a handle out of it. You have to be a card-carrying Indian  to do this. I own an eagle feather which another Indian gave to me. He  found out through another person that I wanted one, and he gave it to me  right before he died, actually. So I have those, and then I had to find  some other feathers to expand this thing I want to make. I was told  turkey feathers are the best thing to use, so then I had to send out an  email.    Who   s going turkey hunting anytime soon? I need some turkey  feathers.    I got turkey feathers, so I have all the fixings for this. I just  have to put it together, but that   s one thing I want to do.  I have a shadow box that I   m going to put it in so that I can put it on  display. I think also, touching on what Steve says about the Native  American, that   s really important to me. I appreciate going to the  museum. That legacy is really important, and I   ve had some  conversations with people at the museum about our relationship to the  Creek Nation. We talked about this yesterday. Pleasant Porter, who was  a chief, he was the last known chief of the tribe prior to treaties which  was in 1907. Based on what he told me yesterday, (and my mother said I  have a picture of him in full dress) we   re cousins. There   s definitely a  strong relationship from that tribal sense in the McElroys. I think that   s  the other legacy that   s real important.  It   s good that you still feel that connection.  Yes, yes.  Now y   all are here tonight for something special.  We are.  Could you tell us a little bit about the award?  Well, this is the sixtieth year that the Dean  Clarence H.  McElroy  Award has been given to the outstanding graduating senior class  member. I don   t know what the guidelines are on how they do it. I think  the class. It may be a combination of the class, and the teachers decide  on who gets it. It   s a big deal. It   s a surprise to the person. I, last year  19  S. McElroy  P. McElroy  Nykolaiszyn  P. McElroy  when I was here, kind of got this crazy idea. I emailed back here and  said,    When was this thing first started?    They told me, so I did a little  math. I said    The sixtieth anniversary of this thing is coming up. What if  you try to invite as many back as you can?    Well, they brought it to  some committee and thought that was a great idea, so that   s why there   s,  like, thirteen of them coming tonight for the awards. This particular  awards banquet is, as I said, an annual thing. They give out 250 awards  at the evening, and they do it very well because they do it every year. It  moves, even though you look at this horrendous list. It   s amazing how  fast they do get it done. Some of them are huge amounts. These people  get twenty thousand dollars. Some, they get 500. Some they know about  because they   ve had to fill out      Apply for them.     resume   not resumes, like a story.    What would you do in your  practice,    or that kind of stuff. Some, because of the kind of work they  want to go into, they   re going to go be veterinarians to birds or  something, there are special awards for that. It   s an interesting thing  from my point of view to see the different kind of awards and the  different,    Oh, they   re going to go into cats. Oh, okay,    or horses. Then  it   s always interesting to see who the person is.  What I have been doing for the past four of five years, even if I   m not  here   it doesn   t really matter. If I   m here, I   m happy. I meet them. Then  I get their email address, and I email them later. If I haven   t met them,  then I say congratulations on an email, and I say,    Tell me a little bit  about yourself.    Then they give me some more information about how  they got into vet med and what they want to do. I get these stories about,     Well, I   m going to go work with my dad who does horse veterinarian  practice,    and that kind of stuff, so I really have enjoyed that. In years  past, they   ve always sent me a letter, about three weeks before, telling  me who   s going to get it. They didn   t do that last year. I think part of  that was because of the transition between the deans. I got the letter this  year, so I know who it is.  Well, don   t tell us  (Laughs)  Oh, I   m not going to tell  I kind of like that, to know, and if I happen to  meet them, fine. It   s really kind of cool, and then to take the picture  afterward. Then, of course, it gets in the Vet Cetera magazine which is  always nice. I look forward to it from the standpoint I get a new outfit  and find orange. Finding orange down in Louisiana is a little hard, and a  lot of times it   s Tennessee orange. I was looking for my new outfit, and  so I took my OSU hat into one of the places. I said,    I need to match this  hat.       Okay.       I need a new out          Okay.       It can   t be Tennessee  20  S. McElroy  P. McElroy  Nykolaiszyn  S. McElroy  P. McElroy  S. McElroy  Nykolaiszyn  P. McElroy  orange.     A lot of yellow and black down there.  Yes, we found it. That   s always a challenge every year if I   m coming.  (Laughs)  Steven is this your first banquet?  This is my first banquet. I actually tried to make the journey last year,  again, on my motorcycle, and that time of year there   s a lot of storms  rolling through. I had a window that I thought I was going to be able to  capitalize on, however I forgot about all the snow that all the storms  dumped on the mountain passes.  He hit a dead end. He hit a road-close.  I hit a road-close in Utah, and I was very disappointed to have to turn  back and drive back home. I vowed to come out here this year. Even if I  had to fly, (I really wanted to ride) I was coming. The weather   s been  really kind of dry this year, so all the roads were really nice. Had a great  journey out here. I   m compelled to do it as a way to honor my family  and my ancestors.  Well, as we wind down here, is there anything else you   d like to add  before we close on out, any final remembrances of Dean McElroy?  Well, I will tell you that I started doing some research, which  interestingly I found that I was in the wrong part of the years. I wanted  to do an article for the alumni magazine on    the forgotten president    or     the lost president.    I could decide what the title, working title, and do a  little blurb on when Granddaddy actually functioned as an interim  president of this university. Turned out it was back in    23. I thought it  was much later, during President  Henry  Bennett   s era, but I was  wrong. I thought,    Oh, I   ve been looking in the wrong spot.    I still  would like to write the article.  The interesting thing was I had gone to Old Central one day, and the  lady who kind of stays over there and takes care of it   they have  pictures up there of the presidents, and Granddaddy   s picture   s not up  there. Granddaddy used to have a room there. He lived there while he  was in school, and for room and board he helped clean the building. So  she was telling me it was unfortunate she couldn   t add his picture  because they don   t see him as one of the presidents because he was an  interim. I still think that might be a nice little short article for even the  paper or the magazine, so I   m still toying with that kind of thing to do a  21  Nykolaiszyn  P. McElroy  S. McElroy  P. McElroy  Nykolaiszyn  P. McElroy  S. McElroy  Nykolaiszyn  little blurb on there.  I think so. I think that   s a little bit of OSU history we really don   t think  about.  Yes, yes, because it wasn   t very long and it was just for a purpose. I  think my concern was,    Were there others?    I didn   t really want to be  exclusive to him and not have some others, so that   s why I haven   t really  gone any further on that, especially when I found out I was in the wrong  year. Oops. Hopefully, I   ll get that done.  Time to get to that.  Yes, one of my retirement bucket list.  Add it to the list. Well, we really appreciate your time today. Thank you  so much for sitting down with us and recording some of your memories  of your family.  You   re welcome.  Thank you for having us.  Thank you.  -------  -------
