 Little Thunder This is Julie Pearson-Little Thunder, and today is April 5, 2018. I am interviewing Mr. Harold Fields for the Oklahoma Oral History Research Program at Oklahoma State University. Mr. Fields, you were a 1969 graduate of Oklahoma State University. You spoke very eloquently last night at the    Tragedy and Transformation    event about your experiences in Atlanta while you happened to be there for a conference and Dr. Martin Luther King was assassinated. In this interview, I would like to learn a little bit more about your personal history, your education at OSU, the professional work you did afterwards, and your work in social and racial justice since that time. Thank you for talking with me.  Fields It   s a pleasure to be here. Thanks for the invitation.  Little Thunder Where were you born, and where did you grow up?  Fields I was born in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and lived there up until the day I graduated and moved away from Oklahoma State. The area I grew up in was called the Greenwood area of Tulsa, segregated city. I grew up with people who survived the 1921 race riots who were my teachers, parents of my friends, and people I went to church with. I felt like it was a great place to grow up. (Laughter) I had great schools, all the way from elementary and on up to high school, with great teachers who cared about us quite a bit. My mother was a teacher at the elementary school, and her classroom   she was a speech   .  Little Thunder Was this the name of the elementary school?  Fields Dunbar Elementary School. She was a speech teacher at the time that I was born. I grew up on a stage because her classroom had a big stage in it, which 5  somewhat made me comfortable with being able to make presentations and that kind of thing. I have a brother who   s much younger. When she came back from maternity leave, then she taught art because one of her degrees was in art. My brother picked up the artistic part of the family, but I thought I had it. Watching Mom draw things and make things all the time, I thought I had it, and when I came to Oklahoma State, I thought I wanted to be an architect. I wasn   t as artistic as I thought architects needed to be  (Laughter) That   s when I switched over to civil engineering after a semester or two. I said,    I think I   m a little bit more technically inclined than artistically inclined.     Little Thunder You had this creative environment in your home. Then your father was remarkable, too, in that he didn   t have a lot of formal education but he had his own plumbing business, and a real force in your life.  Fields My dad was number five of sixteen children, and he was sort of the hub of the family in many ways. People would come to town; they   d spend time with him, with us. He helped get many of his brothers and sisters into business, taught several of his brothers the plumbing business. He converted the front room of our house to be a beauty shop for one of his sisters to operate her beauty parlor out of. Third grade was the only education he had, but he taught himself to get into the plumbing business and to grow it until there were a dozen men. We had customers all over the city of Tulsa, black and white. That was a good experience for me, to be able to do that with him. I will say, this may be of slight interest, but because he was one of sixteen children, on that side of the family I have eighty first cousins.  Little Thunder Wow   Fields We   re very close. I have maintained a spreadsheet that has hundreds and hundreds of names, of trying to collect all these names. We   ve actually had a family reunion in Oklahoma City where seven hundred people showed up for it, so very, very big family.  Little Thunder To be connected like that, that   s really amazing. I   m wondering, too, you   re hanging around because you end up working in engineering and systems, and you   re hanging around your dad. You   re watching how parts are put together sometimes. I don   t know if that played a role in your interest in engineering, but there   s certainly an aspect of that in the way things work.  Fields I certainly watched   a number of the projects we had were building homes from the ground up, so you watch all those pieces come together. A lot of the work was frozen pipes in the wintertime, and I think frozen pipes put me through college. (Laughter) I wasn   t interested in really taking over a family business. I was a bookworm. In order to make my dad happy, one of the things I noticed was that he had some difficulty getting his statements put 6  together and collecting the bills. Once I learned to type, I volunteered to type the statements and then go out and collect the money and help make payroll. That was something he was very happy to turn over to me, to let me take care of that.  Little Thunder How old were you at that point?  Fields I was probably sixteen because I was able to drive and get around town to do that, so I was sixteen at that time. That was my major contribution to the company. Even though I did learn thread pipe, and do deliveries, and pick up supplies, my contribution was to help him with the finances.  Little Thunder That   s really interesting. Not every sixteen-year-old would be confident enough, probably, to even do that.  Fields His feeling was that people wouldn   t turn me down when I went to collect the money. They would say,    Oh, here   s this boy here. We got to pay up      Little Thunder    Isn   t he cute? We got to pay.    (Laughter) You talked a bit about your involvement with the church, and also a bit about riding your bike (Laughs) through the halls of Langston  University , like you said, really interested in books and education. What were you really   what classes drew your interest when you were younger, before you get to high school? What kinds of classes are you interested in?  Fields I certainly was interested in band. The first instrument I picked up I had to play was the piano because we had a piano at home. One of Mom   s good friends was a piano teacher, and I was learning from her. Then I learned to play the violin when I was in sixth grade, then I moved to the clarinet in junior high. It was Carver Junior High at that time. I think it   s called Carver Middle School now, but it was Junior High. I thoroughly gravitated toward the musical things, but I was still pretty much into academics, as well.  Little Thunder Did you like math quite a bit, math and science?  Fields I did. I will tell you that I had such a great relationship with my high school math teacher that after graduation, he would drive out to New York and come visit me. My kids called him Uncle Bob. (Laughter) I made some good connections with people. I think part of that is because my mom is a teacher, so the social circles that she was in had people like that in it. I stayed in contact with my high school teachers while I was in college. I was constantly going back, talking to the students back at Booker T. Washington High School and meeting with them and occasionally speaking at a student meeting in the auditorium periodically. I maintained really, really good connections with folks during the time that I was here at OSU, and helping to encourage kids who wanted to go to college. 7  We grew up in an environment which our teachers expected a lot of us, and they were in our corner. They were people that didn   t disappear at three o   clock. You would see them at night, at church, in the grocery store. You could not get away from the first-hand report given to your parents. (Laughs) You didn   t have to wait for a teacher conference. It would happen dynamically somewhere. It was an environment with those black teachers who wanted to see us succeed so much that we wanted to turn it around, and folk behind us,    Come on. It   s okay     When I came to Oklahoma State, I was fortunate that I had a bunch of classmates who were here, so I didn   t feel isolated.  I had some older cousins, an older cousin who was a couple years ahead of me. We would study together. He kind of helped ground me in some good habits when I got here. I felt like I had moved into a community that instead of being one of the top kids in a school of a thousand people, I was one of the kids in fifteen thousand or eighteen thousand, whatever it was, but it didn   t frighten me. I knew I had to step up to meet the challenges because the expectations were that you   re going to get this education and you   re going to do good. Especially when you turn down a scholarship already for somewhere else that was fully paid, you better do good when you get to OSU. (Laughs)  Little Thunder I want to talk about that in a minute. That network that extended, that network of caring, kind of, and you were able to enjoy that here even on campus     Fields Yes, I was.  Little Thunder    because you had those connections, because you mentioned it   s such a powerful example to come back to talk to students when you   re still in college and inspire them.  Fields I continue that. This may be out of sequence, but   after thirteen years at IBM, I went to work for Frontier Airlines. I still stayed connected to the school. We brought a black flight crew, black pilots, black flight attendants, working a trip together, and I was with them. I said,    Let   s go     I arranged for us to go to a career day at my high school and to go do that at a couple of schools: one in Denver and one in Tulsa. It was really   I felt so connected to that group of people, unlike   . I didn   t have that same connection with OSU. OSU was much more impersonal to me, but the people who I went to high school with (there were three hundred in my graduating class) were like cousins. They were like the family, and knowing their parents. I   m constantly now getting notices of the ones who are dying, parents, their brothers and sisters, parents, and it   s almost like a family thing still for me. That had a lot to do with my identity, who I am. 8  Little Thunder I do want to have a chance to talk briefly about the story that you shared last night in case somebody listening to this interview didn   t hear it. You mentioned that you had written the best essay for the Tulsa Library contest.  Fields That was a   Tulsa Schools had a research   write an essay where you did some research about something. I did the research on the design and construction of airport terminals. The reason that I went that direction was my dad. One of the architects that Dad did some projects for, Mr. Bradley, knew of my interest in architecture. I thought I wanted to be an architect. It   s better than being a plumber, crawling under buildings. You can   t live without plumbers. If your sewer is stopped up, you have to get out of your house. You cannot stay there. You know that. (Laughs) We definitely need the plumbers and carpenters of the world, and I   m very proud to have come from that. I asked Mr. Bradley if he could help me make contact with the guys who did that design  the Tulsa International Airport , and he did. I got some tours, had some interviews with them, got to see some behind-the-scenes, and wrote my essay. It turned out to be the best essay. At that time, that was around 1963, perhaps. They said,    We can   t say a Negro boy has got the best essay, so we   re going to give you a full scholarship to Spartan School of Aeronautics but say that you won second prize.    I think that whatever the first-prize winner got didn   t come close in value to what I got. I don   t know how they explained that, but that wasn   t my problem. (Laughter)  Little Thunder But your father said,    No. You will not use this scholarship.     Fields That   s right. First of all, it was somewhat offensive to say,    We can   t say that you have the best. We got to put that down and hide it.    The other thing was that he wanted me to get a full degree because it was something that he would have wanted to have been able to do for himself. The insistence was,    You   re going to go ahead and go to Oklahoma State engineering school.    I will tell you, (excuse me for interrupting) the fun thing about today is that the first appointment I had this morning was with a class in airline management. These kids, they were looking at design of airport buildings.  Little Thunder You were innovative even back then. (Laughter)  Fields I told them some stories about being project director of flight ops, engineering, and maintenance at Frontier and being the chief designer of United   s Apollo  reservation  system. When they told me what this class was about, I said,    Whoa, wait a minute  I can   t believe it  There   s more. Let me tell you....    (Laughter) We had some good discussions. It was energizing to be with young folk and to be able to share some of the real, practical things that I   ve experienced and learned in an industry that they   re studying. That was just fun. 9  Little Thunder That is really neat. How did you   . Of course, you   re dealing with these   . You   re in this very nurturing environment, but, of course, the minute you venture outside of it, you   re running into those walls. If you get that, when you   ve written the best essay, to be told you can   t get first place, how did you channel your feelings? How did you handle that?  Fields I think most of us in my generation, a lot of black folk for generations and generations have been trained and told,    You have to be twice as good to be accepted.    While it   s disappointing, you know that there   s some satisfaction of knowing that,    Yeah, you had the best. You did it.    You shouldn   t have to be twice as good in order to prove anything. Kids shouldn   t have to do that, but that   s the world I grew up in. Maybe that led to the drive and successes I had in my career because always felt like   . It wasn   t like a contest to be the best, but it was more of an internal thing. I had to push myself to do the best that I could. There were times I felt like,    Oh, man, this is hard,    but the end results would turn out to be very good. I   ll give you an example. The first, as an engineering student, I had to take a programming class. Maybe I was a sophomore when I had my first programming class. I think I was. I   m sure I was. It was a class in Fortran programming, and I was lost the whole semester. I had to have somebody help me with every exercise. It was a hard concept for me to pick up, but I worked at it and worked at it.  Part of it was the professor was a very poor communicator. He was brilliant, but he didn   t explain things, at all, very well. The summer before, I had worked, a summer intern, for the Army Corps of Engineers, downtown Tulsa. I was working in the drafting department, working on designs for dams on the Arkansas River system. These were actually what they called as-built. The dams were already there, but then we had to change the drawing to represent what actually got put in place. That summer was backbreaking, was hovering over drafting tables. I think this is part of why I said,    I don   t think I want to be an architect.    (Laughs) I got some experience hovering over that drafting table a long time that summer. Having just finished this course in Fortran and having trouble with it, when I went back to Corps of Engineers the next summer, my math teacher had put me in contact with the chief of the computer department there. I asked for a transfer to work in the computer section, and they gave me something practical to do. I rewrote a linear programming system that they had that GE had sent out, and I rewrote it in Fortran. Then we started doing things with it, feeding data to it, and things clicked.  I had something real to do it with, not something about some recipe. What if you were baking a cake? Draw a diagram of what are the ingredients of baking a cake and stuff like that. Something really practical, and things clicked. When I went back to OSU the next year, I started writing programs 10  to do my homework. I had these engineering things to do, and structures and things like that, and so sometimes instead of doing the homework I would write a program to do it. Then I   d have to consider all the things. What if this happened? What if that happened? I learned a lot of theory, beyond getting the right answer, about the variations and things. That was very enlightening to me. I started volunteering with that professor and said,    Can I be a lab instructor? I want to help some kids who are struggling like I was struggling.    Because I watched my mom teach classes and teach Sunday school and do things like that, I knew how to convey information to people. Occasionally, I got to do the lectures. When he had to be away, he asked me to get ready for it, and I did a couple of them.  Little Thunder You   re an undergrad.  Fields I   m an undergrad, (Laughter) yes. The other thing, I   ll tell you this. It   s a funny story. I had a statistics instructor who was a very challenging person to be in his class because he would pick and ask somebody a question. Whoever he asked a question the first time would get every question for the whole hour, so you knew that if you got asked, okay, you   re in the hot seat today. (Laughter) This guy was a former Korean War POW interrogator, and that was a technique that he used to ask questions. We were all biting our nails in fear. I decided,    I don   t ever want to be in the hot seat,    so I had a strategy. I would volunteer to write programs for him for a research project that he was doing. (Laughs) I said,    I can help you with that,    and he never touched me. (Laughter) He never called on me. I learned very early about the strategy of survival, and I called it defensive programming. (Laughter) I wrote programs for the school of civil engineering and for helping graduates who were doing research on air pollution. I began to get more into computer science than I was in the engineering because that   s how I was working my way through college.  Little Thunder Right, you had all that practical   .  Fields Then that summer after working in the Corps of Engineers, I became an intern for IBM for two summers at the branch office in Tulsa, working on Amoco accounts and oil companies and taking them to another level. They actually started recruiting some of my friends in my last year. I was recruiting for IBM on campus and encouraging friends of mine to join the company, and several of them did.  Little Thunder You also ran for the student senate, though, at some point, and I wasn   t sure if that was before your Atlanta trip or after, that you ran for   .  Fields It was before.  11  Little Thunder It was before. What did you learn doing that? What kinds of skills did you feel you came away with or you went in with that were helpful? You were representing the Engineering Department, right?  Fields Yeah, right. One of my friends was David Harris. He was a white boy, went to school in Tulsa, but we connected. Maybe he was student council president at  Will Rogers High School  or somewhere, one of the high schools, and so we knew each other before we came to OSU. We continued to be friends at OSU. He convinced me to run for student senate because he was going to run, so we were going to do this together. I had to hone my campaigning skills, (Laughs) and that was interesting. I didn   t feel like an outsider, racially, when I was here because I was in the Air Force ROTC drill team, and I was just doing my thing, sometimes putting my head down and making things happen.  I don   t know that I was doing this because I   d be the first African American. That was a by-product. The Stillwater newspaper covered it, and it became a big deal with people that I did do this. Then it connected me to another level, strata, of people. I did spend a lot of time in the president   s residence after that, meeting with freshmen coming in and connecting with   . I think President  Robert  Kamm was president at the time. I generated some friendships out of that, and I don   t recall any real big issues that we were deciding at the time because there was so much going on in my life. The senate was a good experience for me. It really was. It seemed like a natural follow-up to being in student council in high school and junior high.  Little Thunder Okay, yeah, you were   . That was a familiar leadership role that you   d been doing. Did you know anything about the race relations committee? I guess that was established in    65. Did you know anything about that?  Fields I wasn   t involved with that, no, although I talked to some friends who were involved in it and was a sounding board for some things but not enough to make comments about issues they were dealing with.  Little Thunder How about some of the other Booker T. graduates? Were they involved with Black Heritage Week at OSU? I don   t know when that was started, actually. I   m not sure about a date.  Fields I can   t remember us having a Black Heritage when I was here.  Little Thunder Yeah, that might have preceded that. Then Julian Bond.  Fields I was there for Julian   s   yeah. It was very inspiring to hear this young man from Georgia talk. Good looking dude and seemed to be so knowledgeable and worldly, compared to what we were used to here. I will tell you that one of my friends in Denver is Whitney Young   s daughter, Lauren Casteel, and 12  they were next-door neighbors to Julian Bond. When Julian died a year or so ago, I was talking to Lauren, and she says,    Julian taught me how to tie my shoes. I was a little kid, and he was this teenager, and he helped me tie my shoes     (Laughter)  Little Thunder That   s a neat story. So basically, you have a job when you graduate. You   ve been interning at IBM, and that   s where you go, right, full-time?  Fields Yeah, I had a job. I made a mistake. One mistake that I made was that I didn   t take interviews with different companies. I had a roommate, Johnny Jones who was from Bartlesville, white guy. Johnny was in mechanical engineering, I believe. He was interviewing all over the place and flying to these interviews, and I didn   t do that because,    I know what I   m going to do.    I should have taken these interviews. I should have looked around. I should have enjoyed myself  (Laughter) I was a little too focused.    I know what I   m going to do. I don   t need to do that stuff.    I should have gone. (Laughs) I may have had something that may have attracted my attention to get me to go in a different direction, but I should have been taking those interviews. (Laughter)  Little Thunder It   s nice to hear you say that, really, most of your experiences at OSU, you focused on your studies. Race is not an issue except for when you move into the dorm.  Fields Race was an issue over at University Heights Baptist Church. Off the campus, it was     Little Thunder Okay, I would love to hear about that.  Fields    because when I first got here, the miscegenation laws were still enforced. There were some deacons who made it very clear to me that I was not to mess with any of these little white girls. They monitored my movements to make sure that I didn   t do that. For social life, especially after I got my car, I drove down to Langston because I had lots of classmates and friends down there and had a girlfriend down there, so I   d run down to Langston. I had met a young woman who was from Tulsa, and we both sang in the choir at University Heights. You may have to edit this out, but she couldn   t sing. (Laughter) At a Baptist church, if you were in the choir, you get to do that. We were in the same youth group, and so Cyndy and I became good friends. We would always go to movies or go out to eat after the Sunday night services, and became really good friends. She had a boyfriend; I had a girlfriend. We were growing closer to each other emotionally, but we knew that,    You can   t do this.    We did get married after I left OSU, but it was hell.      13  Little Thunder Okay, so you didn   t get any other job interviews, and you end up working for IBM. How did you land in Denver?  Fields I came to Denver the summer before I graduated from college to visit. My mother   s sorority had a national meeting here, and I was bringing two of her college sorority sisters, young sorority sisters who were friends of Mom, up here. While they were in their meetings, I was out seeing the city. One of Mom   s friends who used to play piano at our church had moved here. Her husband worked for IBM, and he was showing me around. My thinking was, my rationale was,    Whoa, nobody told me about these mountains  (Laughter) This is great  I got to come back. Somehow, I got to find a way to get here.    When IBM wanted to make me a permanent offer to go to work for them, the offer was going to be for working in Tulsa, the branch office in Tulsa as assistant engineer.  I asked around and said,    How do you get a transfer to Colorado?    The answer I got back was,    There   s a long waiting list of people who want to transfer. If you don   t hire into Colorado, it   ll be a while before you get here.    I got my courage up and said to IBM,    If you want me to work for you, it   s Denver or nowhere.    A month later, I was here, (Laughter) so I guess I negotiated that. I told some students today that story. Told them to remember things can be negotiated. You don   t have to take the first thing that   s put on the table for you. You got to push for what you want. If you don   t ask, you   re not going to get it for sure if you don   t ask for it. All they can say is no, and you might just get what you want.  Little Thunder How was Denver different from Tulsa?  Fields It was like a different world. It was much more metropolitan, bigger city, all kinds of things to do. The challenge of being out of college and then getting involved in the work world was super invigorating for me. It was very right for a young man. I   ll tell you this. When I was apartment-hunting when I first got there, Denver put me up in a hotel, which happened to be the Playboy Club. (Laughs) I think they had a good idea of how to make me feel like,    I want to be here.    (Laughter) My first night in Denver, January, I   m having dinner on the top level, up in the club. It   s snowing, and I don   t get to see snow that   s sparkly like that that   s falling over the city lights downtown, out this window. Then there was these Bunnies over here. Which way do I look? (Laughter) Get whiplash  Denver was a great place for me to go, and to raise a family. I   ll tell you later about the neighborhood we chose to live in and why we chose that neighborhood when we get around to the multiracial family thing.  Little Thunder I read that you helped develop some of the following tools: spreadsheet technology, (and that   s really interesting to me because you were, both with your father   s business, you have all this incentive, and in college, too, 14  you   re   doing all of these programming experiments on your own to better master programming) the first laser video disc, and hotel reservation systems. Which of those do you think has had the biggest impact?  Fields They had different impacts. They   ve all been very impactful. Everybody uses Excel, and before that was Lotus 1-2-3 and Symphony. There   s been many variations of that technology. The business world revolves around some of that, right? DVDs, that   s a big thing, too. In order to create the video disc, we had to invent the IBM PC to drive it, so the PC came out of that. At one time, it was one project, and then we split it into two projects. Sent the PC down to Boca Raton, Florida, and we kept the video disc up in New York. The first video disc was a big disc like this, big as a thirty-three-and-a-third record, gold-looking thing. Put movies on it or play games with it. For me, that was an incredible environment. My work environment looked like the bridge of Star Trek. I had the opportunity to control all kinds of devices from the computer that I was working on, disc drives, tape drives, TV monitors on the other side for consumers to test it, and then work with people in Hollywood to generate the demonstration materials.  I actually worked with Charles Eames, the furniture designer. You   ve heard of the Eames chair? Eames was a furniture designer, but he was also a media expert and a real renaissance person. He designed the IBM Museum that   s in Manhattan. He designed Dulles Airport, that whole concept for putting the planes out there and having these buses go back and forth. I got to work with him the year before he died. When I was at the Library of Congress last year, doing some research on a book that I   m doing, I had been told that there were pictures of me with Charles Eames at the Library of Congress in the Eames Collection. My wife and I spent a whole day looking and trying to narrow   . I knew which months I had been with him, and we found them. We found two dozen pictures of me in the Library of Congress. (Laughs)  Little Thunder That is so cool   Fields It   s part of the Eames Collection, so that was really cool. That was impactful. The guys that worked for me, when I became a programming manager, created the ability to automatically detect software errors on a computer and download the fixes. Now you see technology all the time where they   re downloading updates. My guys created that, so that   s widespread around the world now. Working at IBM and working in research, I worked at the place where, at times, at the Watson research lab  Thomas J. Watson Research Center . You may have heard of the Watson system that beat Ken Jennings, this artificial intelligence thing that beat Ken Jennings in Jeopardy. At the time that I was there, we were trying to make it learn how to play chess, but it   s gone far beyond that now. One of the things we learned during that was you have to be careful who you let these 15  computers play because it was a learning heuristic. If we let it play a bad player, then it picks up bad habits. (Laughs)  Little Thunder That   s interesting  It makes total sense.  Fields Yes. (Laughter) That environment of creating things that hadn   t happened before translated into my life later on when I   m working in human systems and doing things. I have the mindset we have to have an R and D arm of humanity. We have to do research and development if we   re going to survive, if we   re going to figure out what the right relationships need to be between people. What I learned there and what I learned as an engineer, I learned that I had to be an anthropologist, as well, working in different companies and figuring out who makes decisions, and who does what, and what really works and what doesn   t work. Those things are coming into play with some of the work I   m doing on racial reconciliation and healing right now.  Little Thunder That came out in your talk last night because you happened to mention The Green Book, the Negro   s guide to hotels and eating places in the segregated South, and how that played into your thinking about reservation systems, and making the great point that you need people with these varied experiences. Thank God that experience isn   t condoned by law anymore, but you need people with those diverse experiences who can offer different perspectives on problems.  Fields That   s right. Another way of looking at it is, we should have   . Everybody benefits if women help design how cars operate and what   s available inside of a car: a place to put your purse, a place for your ponytail to be   . It won   t take away from a guy, but it sure helps to not to have to be doing this  Gestures  all the time. (Laughter) Having all of us have a seat at the table and having a voice and making decisions is a benefit to everybody.  Little Thunder Let   s talk about that a little more because after you get to Denver, then you get involved   . At some point you start, yourself, you initiate the Second Tuesday Race Forum in 1997. Of course, Denver has its own history, right, of black and white relationships and Hispanic and Native Americans, but you start this race forum. What inspired you to start that? What did you see its purpose as?  Fields I didn   t actually start it. President Clinton   s commission on race came to Denver to have a meeting there, a community meeting, and to make a report. They wanted to have   a community dialogue on race happened while they were there. Somebody asked Joyce Meskis and Clara Villarosa, two bookstore owners   . Joyce owned the Tattered Cover Bookstore, which is a big, famous bookstore, several locations in Denver, and Clara owned the Hue-Man Experience Bookstore, which was a black-owned bookstore. They 16  pulled together people from two different communities to have this conversation about race because the commission was in town. John Franklin was there. Now, John Franklin was my mother   s elementary school classmate. (Laughs) These connections, these degrees of separation are   . That   s an illusion. (Laughter)  I wasn   t at that meeting, but when they had it, nobody wanted to stop talking. They wanted to continue the conversation. They started having those conversations, initially, at the Hue-Man Bookstore, and that   s   . I had gotten wind of it a few months later, and I started attending. The owner of the bookstore was facilitating those conversations. She decided that she was going to sell the bookstore and move to Harlem. Actually, she opened another bookstore, called The Hue-Man, in Harlem. When she was making the decision to go, she asked me if I would take over and start facilitating. I   ve been facilitating those discussions now for about eighteen years, and we   ve had continuous conversations. The whole concept is based on building trust, not just a one-time conversation. You really can   t deal with this one-time kind of thing, but to build trust, to build vocabulary, to learn to make connections between what happened in history and what   s going on today.  We   ve had hundreds and hundreds of people come through, and it   s an intergenerational thing. I did it for seventeen years by myself, facilitating it, and it was getting out of hand. Success was killing me. (Laughter) I had already started to spawn other groups to reduce the size, starting groups geographically or with a particular affinity interest. In the last year, I have brought on two co-facilitators to help me: a young man who is active in Black Lives Matter, and then a woman who is professor of women   s and African American studies at the University of Colorado. I got help, thank God. (Laughter) It was time to be able to pass the baton on to somebody else to keep it running because I have a book project I want to work on. I have to get out of things in order to focus on that.  Little Thunder Talk about your book project a minute, or can you? Do you want to talk about it yet? You don   t have to.  Fields What I can say right now is that it   s about the period of Reconstruction   and about the incomplete work of Reconstruction when President Johnson ended Reconstruction prematurely because he was against it. There   s some parallels between Lincoln ending the Civil War, freeing the slaves, and then President Obama being president and somebody coming along to undo what he   s done. (Laughs) Some parallels there. I   m writing the story, but I   m going to make it sort of like a fictional story because I think narratives are things that people relate to, about what could have happened if Reconstruction had played out differently, what could have happened fifty years later, a hundred years later, two hundred years later. 17  I   m doing some research about what some of the black Congressmen did who were in Congress during the Reconstruction, and bills they introduced that did not pass. We   re looking at what people were proposing and some other things around the 4,700 documented lynchings, so I have some ideas about that, too. I need to plunge into that. Dr. Harding   s wife suggested to me, says,    You should sit at the keyboard and type. You could type A, B, C, X, Y, Z, A, B, C, until you get sick of doing that. Then start putting words together  You   ve got to do this     (Laughter)  Little Thunder Yeah, it sounds wonderful, that whole    the road not taken      . Can you talk a little bit about the organization Multiracial Families of Colorado? I believe you founded that one.  Fields I was one of the co-founders of that, and that   s because of the marriage that I had, a racially-mixed marriage. I married my friend that I met at University Heights Baptist Church. We had some difficulties getting married, and some trauma around that, which we healed some family relationships and came back together. When we had kids, we realized that we both grew up in environments that we felt fully protected. I grew up in an environment, she grew up in an environment, but we wanted that for our kids, as well. We had moved to New York. One child was born in Denver; the second child was born at Vassar Hospital in Hyde Park, New York, where we were living. After five years in New York, I was able to arrange to come back to Denver to work, actually to Boulder.  We knew exactly what square mile we wanted to live in, called Park Hill neighborhood, very mixed neighborhood. It turns out that we bought a house on the corner, and three of the four houses on that corner were mixed families. It would have been four out of four except that the other family, the fourth family, lived in the second house. They weren   t on the corner. (Laughter) Our kids got to grow up in an environment which they felt like,    This is normal. People look like us around us, everywhere we turn,    so we accomplished that. Part of what helped that happen, in terms of creating normalcy for them, was to create this organization, Multiracial Families of Colorado, which was a support group for people who were in a mixed marriage or who had adopted a child from a different racial or ethnic background.  We   d have monthly meetings: one meeting for the adults to share their experiences and exhale about what happened, and how people look at them and don   t realize that they   re together, all those kinds of things to feel normal; then another event each month for the kids. Get the kids together so they can go to the park together, go to the zoo together, and go to the museum, so we organized a lot of things. It grew to two hundred families by the time that our kids were getting old enough that they didn   t want anybody 18  organizing anything for them, get to be the teen age,    No, no, no, you can   t be involved with what we   re doing.    (Laughter) Out of that, friendships for the kids and for the adults became lifelong, and it was an important thing for us to do. We, because of my airline connections, actually helped start organizations like that in Ohio and other places.  Little Thunder It   s still ongoing?  Fields No   it   s not. We felt the organization should be organic. When it had served its purpose, the people had grown up, let it go. If somebody else wants to do it, they   ll find a way to connect with each other to do it.  Little Thunder That   s really neat. You got the Carl Whitehead Memorial Award in 2017. How did that feel?  Fields That was unexpected. Other people who received those awards were mayors and senators and ministers who were icons to me, and I   m thinking,    I don   t know if I belong to this group of people.    (Laughter) But they felt like I did, so that was quite an honor. It was a big deal but very humbling to me, too, to receive that kind of recognition. For so many of the things that I   ve been devoted to, I   ve been on restorative justice boards, working with the Denver Foundation on the board of directors there currently. This is my second term there.  Little Thunder Can you tell us what the Denver Foundation does?  Fields The Denver Foundation is a community foundation. It is one where many people put money in, and many people receive money out. It   s not a one-to-one kind of thing, which a business gives out its money, or a family gives out its money. People invest in it, and many of them get to have their donor -advised  funds for which they   re going to say,    This is how I want things to go.    We also have a Fund for Denver. A percentage of those funds goes into a common fund for which we do work with homelessness, veterans    issues, hospitals, racial equity efforts. We have over  750,000,000 to work with. I love spending other people   s money. (Laughter) I   m on the executive committee. I get to approve the things that are over a hundred thousand dollars. (Laughs) You become aware of what   s going on, and how people are opening up, and having new ideas. We   re doing impact investment, social bond, impact investing, and giving people opportunities to make money by investing in things that will make a difference socially to the whole community. That is the pinnacle of organizations that I have worked on boards for.  I was also on the board of directors for the I-News Network. This is an investigative journalism organization that did a lot of research about things. At times, they did investigative journalism that helped exonerate some 19  prisoners, and looking into racial equity issues. We were working to merge them with the Rocky Mountain Public Broadcasting, PBS station, so now that   s a part of that. At the same time, be merged in the jazz station. Now we got this thing, and I got to sign those merger papers. That was fun (Laughter) to make that happen. Yeah, I   ve begun to network with a lot of people in Denver and also around the country because of things we   ve been doing with the Thomas Jefferson family and Sally Hemings    family and others in an organization called Coming to the Table. Having an impact on how slavery is interpreted at different historical sites. Doing a lot of interesting work around the country that represents somewhat of a different model of how people can come together and heal.  Little Thunder To pick up on Coming to the Table, were you doing some of that before the documentary Traces of the Trade: Stories from the Deep North before that happened, or was that as a result, partly, of the   .  Fields Traces of the Trade came first.  Little Thunder Okay, and you had a role in   .  Fields I had a role in Traces of the Trade: A Story from the Deep North. We all know what the Deep South was like, but the Deep North had its secrets, too. It   s a story about the descendants of the DeWolf family. James DeWolf, during the time of Jefferson, was the second-richest man in America. He was a US Senator, had warships in the US Navy. What their family did was to make rum and then ship the rum to Ghana to trade for captured Africans, bring them to their plantations in Cuba, and trade them there for sugar and molasses to come back, make more rum, keep that triangle trade going. This family moved more Africans to the Americas than any other family in America. They   re from Rhode Island. They were Northerners. They were   . In the documentary, we take ten of their descendants on this journey to Ghana, Cuba, and back so they can see where their wealth came from, what they owe to black America, what should they do about this. It   s a history lesson in some ways because people don   t know, many people have no idea that the economy in New England was based on the slave trade.  You were either making the ships or making the rum. The banks were insuring the trips and the property that you were bringing back, making the ropes. It was almost like being in Poughkeepsie, New York, for IBM. Everything you do is for IBM. (Laughs) That   s where I was. It was quite an adventure. I was in the movie. I became the national training director for the film to help arrange screenings, to help write user guides for discussions and things like that, and to be present to conduct discussions after the screening. Two of the DeWolf family members lived in Denver, were friends of mine. That   s how I got involved. One of them, Holly, we still screen the movie together. I did anti-racism training with the family to help them deal with 20  what they were experiencing, what they were learning. We premiered this documentary on Martin Luther King Day in 2008. Congressman John Conyers came out from DC just for the screening of this, and he was on a panel that we had. One of the funny things was he made this remark.  He says,    I   ve been calling back to the office, and nobody answers. Then I realized,    This is Martin Luther King Day. They better not be in the office  I sponsored the legislation to make this a national holiday.       (Laughter) At the time in 2008, he says,    We really need to show this movie to Congress because they would benefit from it.    We had two hundred hours of film that we had reduced to eighty-six minutes, so you got to find your story. Katrina Browne was the director of that documentary. It was her   she invited eighty of her cousins to take this journey, sent the invitation out. Nine of them accepted, so it was ten altogether. There was controversy in the family about taking the journey, exposing themselves to the public with this thing, but the family has done incredible work. Those ten have been dedicated to telling the story in a way that you realize that the messenger makes a difference. Who is bringing you the message changes who listens and what they hear, what they pick up. People may expect me to talk about it, but to have a white family says,    We did this, and we took that journey. We looked at it, and we can heal from it, and this is what we   re doing.     It made a heck of a difference. We had a national broadcast on PBS. We have four different versions of the DVD. We got the full, eighty-six-minute one. We have a fifty-five-minute one, too, for classroom use. We have a Spanish language version of it. We have a faith-based version on it that has DVD extras with interviews with the heads of different denominations about their denomination   s role in the slave trade. By the way, DVD extras is one of my contributions to the laser video disc. It was one of my ideas. (Laughter) Can I say that because of Traces being screened and having this national broadcast, I   ll tell you something about that. It was on a show called Point of View, POV. On a regular basis, they show documentaries. Normally, after a documentary is screened, they get maybe a dozen, fifteen online comments. Within twenty-four hours after ours, we had nine hundred comments because it struck a nerve with America, something that needs to be talked about, and this is where that messenger makes a difference. It got the attention of a lot of people.  There were some nay-sayers who were saying,    They   re playing on guilt,    and the stuff like that, but then other people who resonated with,    I think I may have been involved. My family may have been involved.    That   s what got us to Coming to the Table. We were part of the inaugural group that met at Eastern Mennonite University at Harrisonburg, Virginia, a year or so after that to form an organization called Coming to the Table whose purpose was to bring together descendants of former slaves and former slave owners, using a phrase from one of Martin Luther King   s speeches for healing and 21  starting with the families of the Hairstons and the Jeffersons, the Hemings and the others who realized that they are distant cousins, coming together for healing. That   s what got us into Coming to the Table. One of the DeWolfs, Tom DeWolf, one of the things that he   . He   s just retiring from being the executive director of that organization. He   s written some books about the slave trade as a result of his journey, and finding out what he had learned wasn   t true, and actually being in the slave dungeons, (they were in the dungeons of those castles) and he had first-hand experience in them.  When you see it up close and personal, you get a different perspective about it. One of the family members, he and his wife were   the Episcopal church. They were Episcopalians, most everybody in that family, just about. They went to the Episcopal convention to introduce a resolution about slavery, which got approved but not funded. That   s where your organizations say,    We did this, but we haven   t put the money behind it.    Anyhow, he and his wife have gone up and down, really all over the East Coast, showing this to Episcopal churches everywhere and getting people engaged in it. We   re trying to open up, trying to normalize the idea that we can and should talk about it because silence is one of the things that perpetuates racism. If you don   t want to talk about it, then there   s something really wrong here, and people fill in the blanks. (Laughs) We   re trying to normalize a whole different paradigm about that.  Little Thunder I think we   ll maybe wrap up with a question about if we   re able to have this national truth and reconciliation movement and have restorative justice, how do you see that? How do you imagine that that could play out?  Fields HR40, which John Conyers had introduced every year in Congress, was a top-down approach where there should be a national apology thing and reparations. People always go hyperbolic when you say the word    reparations    because it   s money. (Laughs)    Why should my money go to that? I didn   t have anything to do with it. I didn   t have slaves. My family didn   t.    We have a two-tiered society in which one constantly benefits from the history of government policies. Took away from one group of people (literally took things away from one group of people) and gave it to somebody else. Now, that is hidden history that people don   t want to talk about because it   s a form of theft. It   s theft of property, theft of land, theft of opportunity that this country was built upon. That   s going nowhere. The lawsuit that survivors of the    21 race riot in Tulsa brought out, Alexander v. Oklahoma, Alexander being the father of my good friend, the Supreme Court said the statute of limitations has expired.  I always thought that statute of limitation never expired on murder and those kind of things, but for those survivors, they said it expired. The Supreme Court of the United States has sent the message,    There will be no legal recourse for this.    We think that truth and reconciliation won   t work here 22  like they attempted to do it in South Africa. It   s a different culture. Americans are so individualistic in their approach that they don   t understand concept of community, and we pushed away from that in lots of ways that are very harmful to humanity. This approach is one that   s bottom-up where we try to connect people and make people aware of what healing things are going on in this community and that community. One of the things about telling stories is that you usually find out you   re not alone. People, when they hear a story, say,    I   m so glad somebody said that. I   m not by myself     You can get ideas; you can build momentum. We think the momentum can be built, should be built, from the ground-up. Now, doesn   t mean you shouldn   t try to do things legislatively and policy-wise. Those efforts should always continue.  We have to take some hearts and minds; we have to try things out. I think I mentioned that being interested in research and development, R and D, arm of humanity, we have to try some things with humanity. One of the things I   m so interested in is consciousness, what creates a tipping point in consciousness, where an idea, its time has come and then it suddenly flows out. I   ll give you one example. When I was going to IBM graduate school in Midtown Manhattan, I had been invited to attend, it   s called System Research Institute, SRI. One of the things I wanted to do while I was out in New York was do a photo essay about New York. I spent several weeks on the streets of New York, taking pictures of things, but I had a focus. My focus was second-story shops, things right above eye-level that you don   t notice. My project, I called it,    Twenty Feet Above New York.    It was a four-simultaneous-slide-projector show that lasted thirty minutes that shows different things that are right up there. I couldn   t resist. I rented a helicopter, and I did aerial photography, did night photography, Times Square and Central Park.  I made it this grand thing, and   I was working on the laser video disc. One of the things I wanted to have happen was to create a video where you could drive down Fifth Avenue and see all the shops on Fifth Avenue. If you turned on Forty-Eighth Street, you could see what   s on Forty-Eighth Street. We figured out that to get the rights to the photographs for all that would be enormous for big cities, so they tried that with a small town. For the first commercial applications that came out commercially for the laser video disc was something called Touring Aspen. They did it for Aspen, Colorado, where you could drive around and see that. You know how you recognize   you know what that is today? That   s Google Earth, all right? Now, I am not claiming that I created Google Earth at all, but it was something going on, that that idea was coming to a point where it was trying to get born somehow. Somebody did that. When I was working in New York, I was living up in Hyde Park, Poughkeepsie, working in White Plains while I was working on the laser video disc. Commuted a hundred and fifty miles a day. I had three hours on the road. I had a lot of time to think about stuff. 23  I had a lot of time to think about,    How can I help a computer help me do this so I don   t have to do all of this by myself, all this driving?    I spent time at the Watson Research Library and did some research, and I wrote a white paper called    The Backseat Driver.    It was about how can we use computers and put things in the roads and signs to help it control driving so you can sit back and relax. I went through a couple of levels of management with IBM. They said,    This is a good idea, but we   re going to turn it over to Detroit. We   re going to let them take the ball from here.    Then a few years later, I started seeing onboard screens, GPS things. I said,    Whoa     I pulled out my old copy. I said,    That looks an awful lot like my white paper     I   m not taking any credit for driverless cars. I don   t think anyone will be around when that actually happens, (Laughter) but there were some ideas. The Wright brothers weren   t the only ones figuring out contraptions to do flight. They weren   t the only one, but the ones who got the credit. I   m very interested in consciousness.  What is it about group consciousness that helps an idea become viral and spread to people at a certain tipping point? I think we   re going to begin to explore some of that. I think we   re going to learn   . People who invented flying machines before the Wright brothers had machines that had wings that do this because they watched the birds do this, thinking,    That must be the answer     As you push it off the cliff, you were doing this, and as the ground gets closer, you would say,    Flap harder, harder, harder,    until bam  You crash. (Laughs) You do a few of those, and say,    I don   t think that was the right way to do that.    When we figured out that the shape of the wing, the airfoil, gives lift, that   s what it was. That was a natural law of aerodynamics that we learned to be in harmony with. I think there   s a natural law of human relationships that we must learn to be in harmony with, and that   s what I   m working on right now.  Little Thunder That   s a wonderful note to end on, and I look forward to hearing your discoveries. Thank you so much for your time today.  Fields It   s my pleasure.  -------  -------
