Speaker 1: Let's get this HistoryMakers [The HistoryMakers] interview started. I'm Cheryl Butler, I'll be conducting the interview today. Also joined by Matthew Hickey, who is the videographer. I'd like have you say your full name and spell it please?
Speaker 2: My name is Russell Williams, that's R-U-S-S-E-L-L, Williams, W-I-L-L-I-A-M-S, the II [HistoryMaker Russell Williams, II].
Speaker 1: When were you born and where?
Speaker 2: I was born October 14th, 1952 in Washington, D.C., Georgetown University Hospital [MedStar Georgetown University Hospital].
Speaker 1: What is today's date?
Speaker 2: If memory serves me it's the 26th of September 2007.
Speaker 1: And where are we conducting this interview today?
Speaker 2: We're conducting this interview in my office at American University, which is in Washington, D.C. as well.
Speaker 1: Thank you. A few questions just to--we'll actually ask you your profession as well?
Speaker 2: Okay. Well I'm listed on the roster as an artist in residence, that's a fancy professor that comes from some sort of artistic background. And I still have ties in the movie industry, but mostly from the finance side of the movie business as opposed to the almost thirty years I worked behind the scenes in a technical capacity and in certain cases in a producing capacity.
Story_ID: 486285
Speaker 1: Few questions just to get you in the mood.
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: What's your favorite color?
Speaker 2: Do I have a favorite color, I think blue is, is a pretty impressive color, so I'll go with that.
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: Favorite food, I would probably have said, before I went to California, it used to be fried chicken, and after California, it's sushi (laughter).
Speaker 1: Hm, does West Coast sushi compare to East Coast sushi in anyway?
Speaker 2: Well I mean there are some good sushi restaurants probably all over the country now, as strange as it seems, but nothing comes close to Japan. But there're a few in New York [New York] that are top shelf. There're a couple nice ones here in D.C. [Washington, D.C.]. But Los Angeles [California] has its share of really great sushi restaurants, no question about it. San Francisco [California], I for--don't, don't let me leave them out, yes, awesome selection there.
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite time of the year, favorite season?
Speaker 2: I'm an autumn person. Love autumn. I lo- especially having grown up in D.C.  D.C., unfortunately, especially in the summer is a very humid, sticky, bad for your hair, bad for your clothes, just as bad for you other than your sweat glands are very active. So when autumn finally gets here, ha- all the global warming has kind of pushed it a little bit (laughter), you know, later in the year. The air gets a little bit more crisp, and you know, I love sweaters and jackets and a little breeze. And I also love autumn because you get to wear a little bit more variety of clothing. Summer, you pretty much have to take everything off here. And wintertime, wintertime is not bad but, you know, it's a little severe as you get older. When I was a kid, I didn't mind winter, 'cause I'm playing in the snow. You're trying to maneuver in the snow, whole different world. Spring isn't bad, so I'll take autumn number one, spring is my second season.
Speaker 1: What about a vacation destination? What's your favorite spot?
Speaker 2: Love Hawaii as far as the United States is concerned. Another spot out of the country, Italy, Morocco, Marrakesh, I'd pay my own money two or three times to get back to Marrakesh. And let's see, any place else. I, I did enjoy Kenya when I was there in the '80s [1980s]. I don't know, you know, if, if the conditions are still good there, but it was a fabulous place in the '80s [1980s] to go. Not only for safari, but also because the people were so friendly and, and it, it was very enlightening as a, as an African American to, to be in that part of the continent and, and really see not only, you know, the Maasai with their straight backs and their completely erect posture and the very sweet and gentle, at least the ones I met, Kikuyu, but also just to see the landscape there and, and the wonderful animal life, the wildlife. So, now I'm not sure. But, I, I do love Hawaii and love the waterfalls. I'm a scuba diver, so the water is not bad there. The Caribbean had been one of my favorite spots but, you know, once you've been to Hawaii, in my opinion, the lushness of that island kind of spoils you for a lot of other places.
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite quote or saying?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Let's see Cheryl [Cheryl Butler], do I have a favorite quote or saying. I've been quoted as saying a lot of stuff (laughter). Most people ask me on a daily basis how am I doing, and my quote is, any day above ground--let me start that again, any day above ground is a victory. Okay, that's me. But quotes from other people, "By any means necessary" comes to mind. I remember one that I heard Ella Fitzgerald give in an interview, I think at a Playboy Jazz Festival, and every day I get older this makes more sense to me, is that, "The older you get, the more you realize how few things you actually do by yourself." I was like, go on Ella, you know (laughter). You really do, people are doing things for you even in the background, even though you don't know it, and you may not be aware of it. We are doing things for each other and people are doing things for you. So this whole concept of a self-made man, don't think so. You know, you may have a lot of drive and energy, and you may have connected a lot of the dots, but somebody had to pull some levers somewhere in order to get you in that position to push those buttons, guaranteed. And the older you get, and if you're wise and observant, you'll realize that someone has helped you get to wherever you are.
Story_ID: 486286
Speaker 1: I'm gonna find out a little bit about your family.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Tell me your parents' names, when and where they were born?
Speaker 2: All right, well--
Speaker 1: What about your mom?
Speaker 2: Well, we're getting into complicated territory here. My birth mom was a lady named Lillie Mae Williams [Lillie Robinson Williams] and unfortunately, I never got a chance to meet her. She passed away the morning after I was delivered. Apparently she had a blood clot and as was the practice, I'm told, in those days, she was born in, in an all-white hospital, which is Georgetown University [Georgetown University Hospital; MedStar Georgetown University Hospital, Washington, D.C.] and apparently based on--I've had a couple doctors look at the death certificate. And their opinion is, they basically just didn't check on her on a regular basis while she was in, you know, postpartum and had the clot, and I guess the clot went to her brain. So it was a happy day and it was probably a very, very sad day for my family at the time, it must've been devastating.
Speaker 1: This was--what was the date of that?
Speaker 2: So this was probably the morning of October 15th. I was born at two a.m. on October 14th. So in that, you know, twenty-four hour cycle--
Speaker 1: In 1952?
Speaker 2: In '52 [1952]. And my real dad, Russell Williams, Sr. at the time was working nights at Union Station [Washington, D.C.], and you know, he had to be completely devastated. So what ended up happening, and I--I'm pretty sure this happened within, you know, that first week after delivery, then my next--well my mother's next oldest sister, named Ruth, was childless. You know, she and my--and my uncle were childless, so I basically was raised by an aunt and uncle. And it wasn't until I was maybe, you know, six or seven that I realized that, you know, my aunt and uncle weren't my birth parents. My dad was still around, he had remarried. So I have three sisters and a brother from that union, and they lived in Northeast Washington [D.C.], I lived in Southeast [Washington, D.C.]. So, you know, we were always in touch throughout my childhood and you know, adolescent years. But I called James Harshaw and Ruth Harshaw [Ruth Robinson Harshaw] my mom and dad, and so they were essentially my, you know, sociological parents.
Speaker 1: Very nice. Sad story.
Speaker 2: Yes, and--and I have a friend that went to Wilson High School [Woodrow Wilson High School, Washington, D.C.] with me, who's a Washingtonian and she mentioned, and I've been on her for years. She mentioned that she had seen an article somewhere that talked about, you know, how there were a few, you know, deaths in the '50s [1950s] of black women at, at, you know, so called white hospitals as Georgetown, Columbia [Columbia Hospital for Women, Washington, D.C.], and there was on--another one that was listed in the article. Whereas most African Americans my age and older were born at what was Freedmen's Hospital [Howard University Hospital, Washington, D.C.]. And I don't know if D.C. General [Gallinger Municipal Hospital; District of Columbia General Hospital, Washington, D.C.] was in operation then. But, you know, there, there were a couple hospitals that did most of the business, so to speak, in terms of delivering black babies, even in Washington, D.C., the nation's capital. And I think because my mom's doctor also was a resident at Georgetown, that's where they did the delivery. The other thing that's interesting historically it was that it was also in the early years of doctors actually delivering babies, you know--
Speaker 1: Instead of midwives?
Speaker 2: Absolutely, who knew what they were doing. The doctors are pulling you out with forceps (laughter) and you know what I'm saying, you know, there's no telling what you may look like if a doctor did the delivery. It took, took a few years before people were comfortable with doctors doing deliveries, especially if you grew up in the South and rural areas where midwives did, you know, most if all of that sort of work with the moms. And, and doctors figure well, you know, we have a superior education and these people shouldn't be, you know, dealing with this delivery, you know, suppose there's complications et cetera, et cetera. You know, so yeah they had the medical, you know, understanding of everything, but it doesn't necessarily mean that they had, you know, the so-called bedside treatment to do this sort of work that midwives had been doing for years. So, it, it's also part of that, you know, period in history.

Speaker 1: So your mom, biological mom, Lillie Mae Williams [Lillie Robinson Williams]--
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: --passed away the day after your birth. Do you know around when she was born or where?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I have her exact birthdate I just couldn't find it on the PalmPilot. I wanna say, my aunt that raised me was born in 1920. I wanna say Lillie Mae was born in 1926. And they were all from--all my mom's side of the family is from, basically, Camden, South Carolina.
Speaker 1: Okay. Do you remember hearing any stories about your mom's life as a child and throughout her life?
Speaker 2: Yes. I, I think the stories that I began to hear, main- mainly because I started around twelve or thirteen, I really started to be more and more inquisitive about my real mom. Also, you know, as a teenager you start to become a little rebellious. So I was wondering, well if I had been raised by my real mom would I be--having any (laughter) of the same sort of issues that I'm having with my so-called aunt and uncle [James Harshaw]. But, apparently I got a lot of who I am from my real mom, from Lillie Mae. Apparently she was so--somewhat of a firebrand. She didn't, you know, take to, you know, the segregated South, you know, very kindly and then even moving to Washington, D.C., she wasn't exactly you know, overjoyed with D.C. in the late '40s [1940s] and the '50s [1950s]. And she got here, I guess, right about the time that--that they were changing over the separate facilities in D.C. to, you know, no, you know, de jure segregation of, you know, facilities here. She worked at Garfinckel's department store [Washington, D.C.]. My--my mom, Ruth Ann [Williams' maternal aunt, Ruth Robinson Harshaw], my mother worked at Garfinckel's department store in sales. She was study--I wanna say she was studying to go to Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] or she was about to enter college. She was very fashion conscious apparently. And one of my uncles on my dad's [Russell Williams, Sr.] side knows a lot more about the details. But one of the stories I heard was that--that my dad, as far as she was concerned and the rest of the family, they weren't so impressed with him when they first saw him. They really thought, you know, ah you know, she's probably gonna go for somebody a little bit more sophisticated, a little bit more polished.
Speaker 1: Did she come from--
Speaker 2: (Shakes head).
Speaker 1: Okay well--
Speaker 2: They came, they came, they came from the farm. You know, South Carolina farm. I think, I'm, I'm gonna say that Ruth had told me something about she was, I don't know how old, maybe in her twenties, no couldn't have been that old, maybe in her late teens before she saw her first radio. But the thing that was interesting about her, tha- the--she came from--they came from a family of, of seven. So there were, let's see Lillie Mae, Ruth, Mary Jane [Mary Robinson], Edna [Edna Robinson], so there were four girls and three boys.
Speaker 1: Okay, so what are the names of all the siblings?
Speaker 2: So yeah, the, the oldest sibling was Edna, of the girls, then there was Mary Jane, Ruth and then my mother, Lillie Mae. And then on the men's side, the oldest was Henry [Henry Robinson] and then Walter [Walter Robinson], and then Cleveland [Cleveland Robinson].
Story_ID: 486288
Speaker 1: And your maternal grandfather was a farmer?
Speaker 2: Right. And he was also somewhat of a schoolteacher. Joe, Joe Robinson [Joseph Robinson]. So, my mom's [Lillie Robinson Williams], my mom's maiden name, that whole family was the Robinsons. And Joe apparently was somewhat of a schoolteacher, a farmer, and he had a little side business making some, you know, some white lightning (laughter) I was told.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) What have you heard about that?
Speaker 2: Well, I mean, you know, I--not only have I heard it, I actually saw a couple, couple bottles that they brought it from the South. My grandfather, Joseph, lived in D.C. [Washington, D.C.] up until, I wanna say, maybe '61 [1961] or '62 [1962]. And you know, from the family members that still live in South Carolina, anybody that took a drive down to South Carolina to go to the old homestead and came back, you know, undoubtedly they'll come back with some fresh produce, you know, whatever was in season and they would come back with this big jug, that somehow looked like water and it was in the refrigerator. I remember I was saying, well I'm thirsty and I started to pour this stuff. And as a kid I was still pretty observant as I noticed, as this was going into the glass it didn't slosh around like water would slosh around. It seemed to have this kind of, it was almost in slow motion, it was almost syrupy. And I was like, "Mom [Williams' maternal aunt, Ruth Robinson Harshaw]," I said and it didn't really have a smell to it, so I said, "Mom is this water here?" She said, "Put that back in there, that's that--that's that white lightning that your father [Williams' maternal uncle, James Harshaw] brought up from the da-da." You know, as (laughter) I carefully poured this back before it burned my clothes or something. You know, so I never did get a chance to taste it, but that, you know, that was part of, you know, the, the--part of their lifestyle.
Speaker 1: And he taught in a sort of--was it a one-room schoolhouse?
Speaker 2: You know, the details of the actual schoolhouse I don't know, but I would assume. I mean seeing, seeing what was still around there when I would go down in the '60s [1960s]. There were a lot of one-room action still going on. But they did have a school called Mather Academy which was right there in Camden [South Carolina] and that was, you know (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Pretty prominent--
Speaker 2: Yeah, very prominent--
Speaker 1: --boarding school.
Speaker 2: --and, but you know, in my grandfather's day, I would as- I would assume we're talking wood, wood floors and one-room schoolhouse that probably doubled as a church or whatever. But I never saw any pictures or any more details about that.
Speaker 1: Do you have any sense of when he may have been born?
Speaker 2: Yes. I'm pretty sure he was born in 1899, and that year stuck in my head because that's the same year Duke Ellington came along.
Speaker 1: Ah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 486289
Speaker 1: What about your maternal grandmother, what's her name?
Speaker 2: Her name, now let's see. I met my, my maternal stepmother, my maternal grandmother [Mary Robinson] passed away when, I wanna say, right after Lillie Mae [Lillie Robinson Williams] was born. So she must've passed away somewhere in like the early '30s [1930s] and I do, I do not remember her name off the top of my head.
Speaker 1: But shortly after your mom was born?
Speaker 2: Right. So, the, the woman that I knew as my grandmother--name was Bertha and that was Joe's [Joseph Robinson] second wife.
Speaker 1: And do you know--was she also born in Camden, South Carolina?
Speaker 2: I assume. I know she was South Carolinian, but I'm not sure if she was born specifically in--in that area.
Speaker 1: Okay, so Bertha Robinson [ph.]?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And what did she do for a living, remember?
Speaker 2: Don't remember. I mean by the time I met her, all she did was cook (laughter), and make me feel like a million dollars every time I went over.
Speaker 1: Southern cooking?
Speaker 2: Yeah absolutely, yeah.
Speaker 1: Greens and sweet potatoes.
Speaker 2: Yeah, you know, I mean when, when they had Thanksgiving dinner or any sort of family event at the grandparent- my grandparents, it was laid out. You know, the yams, you had your choice of, you know, turkey, ham, Cornish hens, you know, all the sides that, that we typically would expect, you know, in southern style cooking. You know, fresh biscuits, everything was from scratch, you know. And there'd be a bunch of people in the kitchen at the time. You know, there'd be a bunch of heat coming out of the kitchen. And I'm like, okay when's the food gonna be ready and I would get swatted out. Just, just go out there and wait and be patient, you know. And you know, they'd pull out their best china and you know, just sit around. And I remember one specific time that my meal started out with a little tearf- a little tearful sadness because my aunt had brought a plate to me, Edna [Edna Robinson] had brought a plate over to me, sat it in front of me. My grandfather was sitting to my right. My Uncle Cleveland [Cleveland Robinson] was sitting over here, so I'm chit chatting with Uncle Cleveland and then I look back to the table and the plate of food has disappeared. Not the, not, not the plate being emptied, the plate and the food has disappeared. And so I'm looking around. Everybody's eating and talking as if nothing's happened. I'm like what happened to my plate, you know. And my Aunt Edna came back, "Well where was my plate?" "I don't know, I just gave you a plate," da-da-da. You, so it finally took me, you know, starting to cry before my grandfather, like a magician, came out from underneath the tablecloth with his left hand and put the plate back on there and said, "See, when I was growing up son, if you had that kind of food on your plate, you kept both your hands on the plate and you kept your eyes on your food (laughter)."
Speaker 1: (Laughter) So you never let your plate out of your sight from that point forward (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, food was a little scarce in his day, so. You know, just little, little lessons like that. But it was in--I just said, how could he have gotten that whole plate of food off the table without me seeing it? I mean, 'cause I ra- I wasn't like I was, you know, I was kind of like I looked over at Uncle Cleveland, da-da-da-da, and then looked back and I'm like. And he's sitting over there just, you know, (gesture) innocent, eating, you know, looking around talking, I'm like where's my food (laughter).
Story_ID: 486291
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Do you remember your Aunt Ruth [Ruth Robinson Harshaw] telling you about her grandparents? Do you know Joe's [Joseph Robinson] parents, anything about them, any stories?
Speaker 2: I remember that she mentioned that her grandmother was, I wanna say half Cherokee or one of the Native American tribes that was in the area. But that was one of the things that she and my Aunt Mary Jane [Mary Robinson] were always trying to confirm. I don't remember much of anything about her grandfather.
Speaker 1: Do you know how they got the land, your grandparents?
Speaker 2: No, do not, no, not specifically. They may have been sharecroppers, but you know, I'm just speculating here.
Speaker 1: Did they ever talk about, pass down stories of slavery at all?
Speaker 2: Not in my direct- not in, in their family, but I know that the rumor was that my, my mo- well what would be my great-grandmother, my maternal great-grandmother had been on someone's plantation. I'm not sure about any specifics. I don't remember hearing any specifics of about anybody else.
Speaker 1: Didn't they tell you her name?
Speaker 2: Now they had, I--and I don't have it written down anywhere, yeah.
Speaker 1: Uh-huh, no problem. Any conversations about miscegenation, the mixing of races down there in South Carolina?
Speaker 2: You know, my family you know, seemed to be pretty closed mouth about anything a generation or two before them. You know, they really wouldn't even talk about any situations that they had, you know, with say the whites in South Carolina just going from their farm down to the so-called dusty bin, which was kind of like the, the general store market area, you know. And only later on, I think I had talked to my Uncle Cleveland [Cleveland Robinson], who was the youngest, you know, my mom's [Lillie Robinson Williams] siblings and he, he told me a few stories about, you know, just how you just had to watch, watch yourself. Now on my dad's [Russell Williams, Sr.] side of the family, you know, my dad and his father, John [John Williams]--
Story_ID: 486293
Speaker 1: Well tell me about--your dad was born, you said, when?
Speaker 2: Russell Williams [Russell Williams, Sr.] was born in 1926 in Aiken, South Carolina.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what was his family situation?
Speaker 2: Well, let's see, his mom [Eva Williams], I'm trying to remember her name, her name, her name is, 'cause his, his--most, most of his family stayed in South Carolina. Some of them actually were in Florida, like on his dad's [John Williams] side of the family, some of them actually were in Florida in Titusville. And he--my--he--I remember him telling me a story that he and his dad used to go through Aiken and I would assume by this time he was either a young man or a teenager, and he and his dad walked through town all the time with double-barrel shotguns under their arms. That's, that's just how they rolled (laughter). I said well why, was it a little rough down there. Well yeah, you know, but that way you will be sure nobody was gonna mess with you, okay. So I said all right, I'll take that under advisement (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Your father's family, what did the grandparents do, paternal grandparents?
Speaker 2: You know, as far as I remember, because from my siblings from my dad's second marriage, they really have all of that history in their back pocket. My sister, Debbie Hairston [Deborah Williams Hairston], has actually been doing a lot of work on the family tree and she is more familiar with that. But I wo- I would assume that they're farmers, you know. But I didn't really have that much time with, with my dad even though he lived here in D.C. [Washington, D.C.]. When we did get together, we really didn't talk about, you know, the family so much as, as to, you know, how I was doing in school, did I have a girlfriend, was I being a good son, and you know, was I getting into trouble, those sort of things (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Sure. Did he have many siblings?
Speaker 2: Did he have many siblings? Yes. He had--I wanna say he had one brother and three sisters. But I'll get that confirmed for you.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 486295
Speaker 1: Well tell me about your childhood here in D.C. [Washington, D.C.] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 1: You were born in D.C.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: What's your earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: Wow, earliest childhood memory. I remember and I must've--I could've been maybe as young as two. At that time we were living in a, in the part of Southeast called Benning Heights [Washington, D.C.] in a--in some apartments off of Benning Road and I wanna, I can't remember exactly what street, I think it was one of the numbered streets. But apparently I was really like rambunctious this particular day and I remember running down the street away from my mom and people chasing me. The next real memory I have--
Speaker 1: People, you said people chasing you?
Speaker 2: Yeah, like my, my mom and, and probably one of my aunts. "Come back, come back," and I'm just like, you know, trying to get away, I'm just having--
Speaker 1: And this is Ruth [Williams' maternal aunt, Ruth Robinson Harshaw], right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I'm just having--I'm just giggling and silly, I don't know what I'm doing. I do remember specifically going to President Eisenhower's [President Dwight David "Ike" Eisenhower] second inauguration. So that would've been in '56 [1956], I was, I was four. Probably January 20th, standing at 7th [Street] and Pennsylvania Avenue. And all I really remember, I did not, I don't think I ever actually saw Ike go by, but I know I saw about a thousand soldiers, sailors, Marines [U.S. Marine Corps] and [U.S.] Air Force people. There were tanks, there were rockets, I mean. It was--because, by him being a general, I mean it was--the [U.S.] military was in heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy presence. I mean it was, you know, I said no wonder we won the war. Of course we ha- we were losing. We had lost Korea [Korean War], but (laughter), you know, at that time I wasn't really thinking in terms of Korea, 'cause his glory came from World War II [WWII]. So that was probably one of the earliest memories I have.
Speaker 1: What was--take me through some of the sights you saw, as you mentioned the rockets. Who, who was present at that inauguration, were these, you know, white Washingtonians, black, was it a mixture?
Speaker 2: Well, Washin- Washington has always been a city where very little that I can think of happened here without black and white being, being part of the process. Even if the black people on the scene were the butlers or serving the food, or you know, parking the cars or doing thi- they were still there. Doing the laundry. I mean, there's, there's a couple families that I've heard of that have done, you know, a lot of the, the sort of housekeeping chores in the White House [Washington, D.C.] for years. A lot of the rich people who have wonderful homes here in town and they would--they have a summer home someplace else, they have a vacation home somewhere else. Usually when they would leave, you know, there, there was a black staff that kept the house going while they were away. So, there were very few things here of note in those days that, you know, black and white didn't attend. So yes--
Speaker 1: Do you remember at that event? Do you remember seeing any specific groupings of people?
Speaker 2: Well, I mean at that time, I, I wasn't really aware of an- anything where like whites had to stand on side of the street and blacks on the other. So it was just a--it was just a big crowd of people. As far as I was co- as far as I could tell there were as many black people down there as there were whites. And we were all just looking at this parade. Some--a lot of people had Amer- little American flags on sticks. It was a little chilly, I do remember that, but it was, you know, it was impressive for a four year old I'll put it that way (laughter).
Speaker 1: Did you see the president's motorcade go by?
Speaker 2: I don't believe I actually saw Ike, himself. But I do remember--and if I did, you know, it was just another guy in a car. But you don't miss those tanks going by.
Speaker 1: And so that's what impressed you?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Oh yeah, I mean 'cause, you know, what little boy doesn't play with little soldiers and things like that. So to see them on fu- see them full scale and see that many of them, endless, endless, endless. And then of course there were bands and you know majorettes and things like that. But I was just impressed with all the military hardware that they put out on Pennsylvania Avenue.
Story_ID: 486303
Speaker 1: We're talking about your early childhood memories. Do you remember family members talking about your mom [Lillie Robinson Williams] and what happened? How old were you when you first heard the stories of your mom?
Speaker 2: Well, I wanna say I was probably about five or six when I found out that Ruth [Williams' maternal aunt, Ruth Robinson Harshaw] wasn't really my mom and in the--in the biological sense. But I don't think I started to really probe that issue until I was maybe eight or nine, and then, you know, from that point on, all through high school [Woodrow Wilson High School, Washington, D.C.], you know, I--I kind of felt like, you know, somebody was working and pulling strings in the background. You know, I kind of foun- I kind of felt like, you know, there was, you know, just some--somebody was looking out for me. And I had a really good friend that I'm still in touch with who her dad was one of Washington's [Washington, D.C.] most prestigious pediatricians. So she grew up in a scientific family. And I kept saying to her, you know, I--I can't really get a straight answer from my, you know, my aunts and uncles about what happened to my mom. I mean, with the cir- circumstances of her death, you know, you know, was it directly because of the delivery or was it something else, you know. So she said, "Well, why don't we just go downtown and pull the death certificate." I'm like, duh (laughter), why don't we? And we did, went down and got the death certificate.
Speaker 1: And you were how old?
Speaker 2: Oh you know, I was probably--I think I was probably in tenth grade at the time. And came back over to Muriel--Muriel Crawford [ph.] is the young lady. Her dad, Robert Crawford, very, very prestigious pediatrician and one of my first mentors by the way. And came back, sat in his office and you know, he looked at it and went down through the, (mumbles). Says, "Yeah well, just looks like your mom died from a blood clot and more than likely they just didn't check on her regularly because this would've taken a while. You would've seen signs of her discomfort, you know for maybe up to an hour, maybe two hours before this actually got to a point where it would cause her, you know, you know, cause--cause death." So, you know, we talked about that for a little while. So now I finally knew, it wasn't--it had nothing to do with me. It wasn't a difficult delivery or anything like that, you know.
Speaker 1: Was that a relief for you?
Speaker 2: Well it was, be- because you know, Muriel had told me that she thought that may have been why my--why my family wanted to kind of stay away from the issue. And also, I think, you know, culturally you know, a lot of black people, especially in, in, in my parents' generation, you know, they may not have pushed the envelope the way they should have either from a legal standpoint or from a medical standpoint. And they may have not gotten any real answers that were, you know, worth anything anyway. You know, because a doctor is--in--eve- and you know, doctors in that era were very, you know, "How can you question me?" You know, "I'm a doctor," and that was the attitude, I mean even as a patient, you know, the doc- the information that you can get from doctors now, they would look at you cross-eyed and says well, you know, why am I explaining to you what this medication does versus this medication, oh you know, you saw something on the Internet and so you think know that you have a medical--and I say well let's talk about this or what do you, you know. Back then, it's like now take these two a day and call me. That was a consultation. So more than likely, you know, through their sadness and their grief they may not have, you know, pressed the buttons and asked for any, you know, inquiry or you know, they just boohooed and cried and put my mom in the ground.

Speaker 1: Did you grow up really in two households or you grew up with Ruth [Williams' maternal aunt, Ruth Robinson Harshaw], who was essentially your mom?
Speaker 2: Right, yeah. I basically grew up in--I--well I'll put it this way. I grew up in one household, in Ruth and James' [James Harshaw] household, but we did things, you know, at Russell's [Russell Williams, Sr.] household. They came over to our house for barbeques and things like that. But plus, I also spent time with most of my other aunts, with Mary Jane [Mary Robinson] and with (laughter) Edna [Edna Robinson]. It was kind of like, if I got tired of Ruth's cooking I would go over and spend time--this is mainly during the summertime, I'd spend some time with Mary Jane who was a Seventh-day Adventist. The other advantage of spending some time with Mary Jane, is if I had something I wanted to do, like sports related or movie related on Sunday, I could always go to church with her on Saturday and require my mom's you go to church once a week, you know, rule. (Laughter) So, so that was an advantage. With Edna, Edna lived in a house over on Randolph Place Northeast, right in the shadow of McKinley Tech [McKinley Technical High School; McKinley Technology High School, Washington, D.C.]. So she was the first of the sisters to leave South Carolina and come to Washington, D.C. I think she came in the early--either the early '40s [1940s] or late '30s [1930s]. So she was kind of like a underground railroad so to speak, 'cause everybody that knew someone in South Carolina that was coming to D.C. spent a little time at Aunt Edna's house. I mean I have so many, like, cousins and folks that have spent some time there to get their foot in the door and then got their own apartment. I mean it was amazing. I mean some of my classmates here at American [American University, Washington, D.C.] in the '70s [1970s], we found out that, you know, when I f- when I met their mom, I looked at their mom like I've seen this lady before and then I had to think back and in my parents' wedding pictures, she's standing there as part of the wedding party. Because she just happened to have come up from South Carolina about that time, was in the wedding, and, and (laughter) when we put it together, they're like, "You're little Russell [HistoryMaker Russell Williams, II], oh my god," we're hugging and kissing. I mean, you know. So my aunt's house was pretty much where everybody congregated on the way either to New York or they decided to stay here in, in, in Washington, D.C. Mary Jane would've been the next one to leave. And she and Ruth ended up going to New York and I think they worked in White Plains [New York]. They worked as domestics for a while in White Plains. And at some point, I would say in the late '40s [1940s] or early '50s [1950s] came to D.C. and said, you know, settled in D.C. My mo- my Aunt Mary--my Aunt Mary Jane went into the air--she had been in the Air Force [U.S. Army Air Forces; U.S. Air Force] in--during World War II [WWII] in the Women's Army Corps. And so when she got back to D.C. she started working at Andrews Air Force Base [Joint Base Andrews, Maryland] at the flight clinic out there.

Speaker 1: So help me understand--
Speaker 2: Yeah (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) your neighborhood. So you were--you were living along--in Benning Heights [Washington, D.C.] along Benning Road (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right. So after I--when I was running away from my--from my family. At two years old, we lived in an apartment, I'm not exactly sure what street we were on. But I basically grew up at 826 51st Street Southeast. And it's, it's kind of a triangle. If, if you think of 51st street, Southern Avenue which is the border of D.C. [Washington, D.C.], and there was a letter street, H Street, as in Harry. So that triangle was kind of like my world, my universe.
Speaker 1: Describe the smells, sights, sounds of that neighborhood, take me around the block?
Speaker 2: Okay. Well that neighborhood, we're talking now the '50s [1950s] and '60s [1960s]. There're a lot of kids, which was great. Most of the parents were home owners. There was--the opposite side, the opposite side of my street, probably halfway down started with apartments and then further down we had more apartment units going towards Hanna Place. But H, Southern, at some--at one point Southern Avenue had no houses on it at all. No houses or apartments. And it was just a big field behind our house. So that was our baseball and softball field, and just general frolic. So we were very disappointed when the developers found that little space and then put, you know, they ended up putting houses on there. So, with more houses came more kids, but we had kind of lost our baseball field. Most people on that street or in that area, you know, if they did any outdoor barbequing it would've been fish or it would've been ribs, you know, southern style food. A lot of big maple trees.
Speaker 1: What's your earliest memory, you mentioned sports and playing outside with all these kids in the neighborhood, what's your earliest memory of, of play in that neighborhood?
Speaker 2: My goodness. Well I think one of the things that I loved about the house on 51st Street, the house, itself, was small. It was actually a triplex. There were a series of triplexes up 51st Street and I wanna say on H Street as well. But we all had pretty decent size yards. So I had two big maple trees in the backyard and at some point I had swing sets and things like that. But I remember a lot of the kids would come over and play, and I remember falling out of the tree a couple times, which is probably why I ended up deciding that I was crazy enough to go into the movie business, 'cause you had to be kind of crazy to go in the entertainment.
Speaker 1: And this was a black neighborhood?
Speaker 2: Yes, it, it I, I believe when my parents [Williams' maternal aunt and uncle, Ruth Robinson Harshaw and James Harshaw] bought their home there and let's see, I came along in '52 [1952], so I wanna say they bought in '49 [1949] or something like that. It was--it was really like the suburbs. And then as, as the first families started to buy, I think what whites lived in the neighborhood started to go over into Maryland. So pretty much by the time I remember, you know, being able to like call people by name and things like that, I pretty much, yeah there was--it pr- it was an all-black neighborhood by the time I was, you know, four or five at least.
Story_ID: 486306
Speaker 1: And you mentioned not being fully conscious of the racial divide in D.C. [Washington, D.C.]?
Speaker 2: Well (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Do you remember going from one part of town to another?
Speaker 2: Well, I became more it--more aware of that by--me, you know, my--Ruth [Williams' maternal aunt, Ruth Robinson Harshaw] worked Garfinckel's [Washington, D.C.], so by the time I was old enough to catch the bus and go, say maybe join her for lunch, so now I'm talking ten or twelve. You know, then you start to see, you know, a few looks and you start to see a few people that are, you know, kind of uncomfortable. My dad [Williams' maternal uncle, James Harshaw] worked at the [U.S.] Government Printing Office [U.S. Government Publishing Office], but he also drove a cab. And you know most black parents that I can think of in those days had more than one job. You know, they had their job and then they had to so call hustle. And so being a taxi cab driver was a lot safer in those days. And, and through him driving a cab and me sitting in the right-hand seat a lot of days just making change, that's how I got to see the other side of town, the Northwest, Upper Northwest [Washington, D.C.] and you know, picking up fares. And then I began to see, you know, some, some of the differences and also some of the similarities.
Speaker 1: Can you tell me a story about a cab ride with your dad?
Speaker 2: I remember--I'm trying to remember where we picked this lady up. I wanna say we pick--yeah we picked--I think we picked this lady up at the then Greyhound bus station [Greyhound Bus Terminal, Washington, D.C.] which was on New York Avenue. A nice white lady, but she was flustered. She was in this big hurry. She had to go to National Airport [Washington National Airport; Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, Washington, D.C.], okay. She had to get to National Airport in thirty minutes. That's no big deal back then, but she had to go to her apartment first because she left something in her apartment, maybe it was passport or whatever. So she lived in the Kennedy-Warren apartments on Connecticut Avenue just north of the zoo [National Zoological Park; Smithsonian's National Zoo and Conservation Biology Institute, Washington, D.C.]. And my dad rivaled any NASCAR [National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing, Inc.] driver of today. He whipped us up through all this traffic, he got her--she had to get out of the car, run upstairs, run back down to the car and then we had to go--I think we went through Rock Creek Parkway [Rock Creek and Potomac Parkway], snake our way through and got over to National Airport. I assume she made the plane, but we got her there inside of thirty minutes. (Laughter) And I was saying, this is probably the way--the reason I drive the way I do now. I mean I don't have a car now, once I moved back to D.C. from being chained to a car for twenty-four years in Los Angeles [California], I decided okay, I can increase my, you know, my footprint by not having a car, but you can do that here.
Speaker 1: Uh-huh. So on trips like that, you were able to see certain disparities?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, to me when I went across town in D.C. I really--it, it--to me it wasn't as--you, you would have to go to specific areas to see disparity. Because if we go right down the street from American University [Washington, D.C.], this part Upper Northwest, the houses almost the exact same size and have the exact same yard space as the house I grew up in, in Southeast [Washington, D.C.]. But there were certain areas in D.C. at the time just south--just right down South Capitol Street from the [U.S.] Capitol [Washington, D.C.] there were people who, unfortunately, were having--were living in wood-frame homes that still had outhouses, and still had chickens in their backyard. I'm talking about in the--in the '60s [1960s]. Right next to the Government, Government Printing Office on North Capitol Street, I wanna say there was a street called Defrees [Defrees Alley] and it was like--it was like something out of August, I mean it was something out of a August Wilson novel, you know. If you got to the other end of that street and you hadn't got cut, shot or abducted. I mean it just looked that way. It just looked like, you know, like this was where--this is where the--what would be the homeless community had started from. Now I don't know anything about those people, but I had never seen anything like that, not even in the Deep South, it was like what kind of poverty is this. But when you would go from say, like if you look at homes at Branch Avenue and Alabama Avenue and Southeast, and you go to Upper Northwest until somebody walks out their front door you really can't tell who lives there. As the people keep their yards up, they have flowers, they have nice trees. Maybe the cars on the other side of town maybe a little bit more expensive, but no--not really. I think the real, so called, if there was any disparity in D.C. that I started to really notice, it was really more people's attitudes. In other words, if you were in certain stores in downtown you might get--
Speaker 1: For example?
Speaker 2: Well say for instance, Garfinckel's was notorious. You know, my, my--by my mom working there she used to hip me to all those little scams going. She says no sooner you walk in the door, the store detective starts to follow you. Now you don't know who the store detective is, but you start paying attention to this guy over here, he's the store detective. So, so why's he following me. 'Cause he assumes you're gonna steal something. I said okay. I said so does he do that with every person that comes in that's of my age or--no, really they mostly follow--just, just follow black people. I said okay that's fun. She says, but you know, while they're following all the black people, some of the white people are stealing them blind. I said okay, well, you know, they'll get hip to that if--at some point (laughter). You know, but thank you, you know. I'm not sure about res- 'cause we didn't really go to too many expensive restaurants, you know, when I was coming up. It was, you know, family style stuff (simultaneous).
Story_ID: 486307
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What about movie theaters? You mentioned your aunt [Williams' maternal aunt, Mary Robinson] took you to the movies?
Speaker 2: I don't remember any problems in the movie theaters and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Tell me about some of the movie theaters you attended?
Speaker 2: Well, the movie theaters back in those days Cheryl [Cheryl Butler], were, were palaces. So you, you basically had two different cat- well actually three different categories. You had your neighborhood theaters, you know, your small theaters like the Langston [Langston Theatre, Washington, D.C.]. You had the U Street Corridor [Washington, D.C.], so there you had the Booker T. [Booker T. Theatre, Washington, D.C.], you had the Republic [Republic Theatre, Washington, D.C.] and you had the Lincoln [Lincoln Theatre, Washington, D.C.], and the Lincoln is--still exists and it's been, you know, refurbished and they do live shows there. And then in downtown, you would have the RKO Keith's [RKO Keith's Theatre, Washington, D.C.] which is now where the Old Ebbitt Grill [Washington, D.C.] has moved to, it was in that building. Where the National Press Club [National Press Building, Washington, D.C.] entrance on F Street, that was either the Loew's Palace [Loew's Palace Theater, Washington, D.C.] or the Loew's Capitol [Loew's Capitol Theatre, Washington, D.C.], 'cause there were two Loew's theaters in downtown. I can't remember which one was which. But that was a very impressive movie house. I think where the women's museum [National Museum of Women in the Arts, Washington, D.C.] is now on New York Avenue, that used to be either in that building or, or next to it was a theater called the Trans-Lux [Trans-Lux Theatre, Washington, D.C.]. The Warner Theatre [Washington, D.C.] which has live shows now was a movie house in my days. And so when we went to the movies, which was a weekly event, we would--depending on, on, on whether it was a small independent, and independent in those days meant it wasn't a big studio, but it was a--it was a smaller studio like MGM/UA [Metro Goldwyn Mayer Home Entertainment LLC] or something. The, the movies that kind of spoke specifically to a black audience more than likely would've been on U Street.
Speaker 1: Okay, so give me some examples? Recall a specific memory about seeing a movie on U Street (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay. Wow, I mean, it--it's such a blur. How many movies did I see--well I'm pretty sure that the first time I saw 'In the Heat of the Night' with Sidney Poitier that would've been in '67 [1967]. We saw it on U Street. I don't know whether it was at the Republic or at the Booker T. But then up the hill from me was a neighborhood theater, the Coral Theatre [Capitol Heights, Maryland] which was just over the line in Maryland and I must've seen it eight or nine times there. 'Cause it was just like walk up the hill and go see it. But in the downtown theaters you would see the big epic films. So 'Lawrence of Arabia,' 'Ben-Hur,' 'The Bible' ['The Bible: In the Beginning...'], '2001: A Space Odyssey' by the time that came along, I think that only played at the Uptown [Uptown Theater, Washington, D.C.] which is on Connecticut Avenue, still there.
Speaker 1: So describe for me the social experience of going to these neighborhood theaters or the U Street theaters versus the downtown theaters?
Speaker 2: Okay. At the, at the U Street theaters, pretty much all theaters at the time, as I recall, had--had ushers to take you to your seats. The only difference at the downtown theaters is that in--on some of the shows, since they were the big epics and the big studio productions, they may even give you a little booklet about the movie. And I had all of them until my mom [Williams' maternal aunt, Ruth Robinson Harshaw] cleaned house one day and threw all my movie booklets away. I had, you know, 'Ben-Hur,' 'Lawrence'--all this stuff would be worth money now. I don't personally remember anybody--I don't remember us having to specifically sit in the balcony or anything when we went downtown. I don't remember that. I've heard that, you know, in certain theaters in certain parts of the country that was the rule, you know, the blacks had to go to the balcony. I don't remember that. And if we did go to the balcony, is because, you know, to me that was a better view anyway. You know, I'm not sure whether, you know, that was still in place.
Speaker 1: So none of this whites only, coloreds only?
Speaker 2: We--definitely, by the time I came along there was--I didn't see any signs or any--if there was an unspoken rule, then nobody tur- nobody told me about it. Now I knew that there was a difference between the races and that, you know, that different races had different privileges. And I, I do remember asking my mom, and I wanna say I was in elementary school, I said, you know, it was something--I was--asked her something to the effect of, you know, why, why do we have to be Negro. You know, you know, what, what, you know, is there something--you know, it may even been, you know, to the point where did we do something wrong to be Negro. Because--and I'm, I'm trying to remember whether that was something I had personally experienced or whether that was just from what I was seeing on the early news reports. You know, the, the kind of bubbling up of the Civil Rights Movement. You know, I'm not sure. But I remember asking her that question, and she said, she said, you know, people are people. She said but just some people haven't figured out, you know, that we all bleed, you know, we all sit down when we get tired (laughter), you know, we all cry when we're sad, you know. But now if I'd ask that question to, to my real dad, Russell Williams [Russell Williams, Sr.], he would've had a, a lot more militant answer. You know, with my mom, it was always about, you know, let's ju- let's just make the peace--like don't get upset, you know, just, just kind of, you know, keep your head (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So your biological--
Story_ID: 486308
Speaker 1: --Keep your head (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So your biological dad, Russell, Sr. [Russell Williams, Sr.]--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --was he active in the movements, civil rights, black power?
Speaker 1: He wasn't so much active in the movement, but he was just a, a guy that just didn't take any shit. That was, that was his--I mean, he had a straight back. He worked--he worked manual jobs all his life, you know, and he just wasn't, you know, he said I'm not gonna sweat the small stuff, but you know, you're not gonna disrespect me either.
Speaker 2: Do you have a story to tell about that?
Speaker 1: Only, you know, only--the only one I remember specifically was he and his dad [John Williams] walking through South Carolina. I don't really remember him talking that much about his job at Union Station [Washington, D.C.]. Now, you know, my sisters and brother I'm sure would have a hundred stories about that. But aga- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Tell me--
Speaker 1: --yeah--but again when we got together it was more, you know, more social and was I being a pain in the behind, was I, you know, keeping my grades up?
Story_ID: 486309
Speaker 1: Tell me about your early education experiences. Where did you go to school and what kind of student were you?
Speaker 2: Okay. I started out at Davis Elementary School which is on H--yeah, is on H Street in Southeast [Washington, D.C.] and it was probably maybe a half a mile walk. I got in trouble the very first day of school. Ruth [Williams' maternal aunt, Ruth Robinson Harshaw] walked me to school and I was with m- one of my neighbors' kids down the street, Vash [ph.], Ty [ph.] and may have been another couple kids with, with us. We were walking together to school. First day of kindergarten, right. And so we get to the crossing guard, you know, 'cause they got their little diagonal elastic band and their, you know little bell clip. And so when we to the--to the street corner, the girl--I can't remember if it was a girl or a boy--but they, they put their arms out to stop us from going across the street 'cause the cars are coming. So I tried to push this person out the way. I tried to push this person's arm down, as if to say, you know you can't tell my mom that she can't cross here. And (makes sound), a couple pops on the back of the head. "Oh (imitates crying)." "That's his job silly, let him do his job. He's here to protect you from getting hit by these cars," ah, ah, ah, and you know, and she--the whole rest of the walk up the hill, you know, she's squeezing my hand and said, "You gotta stop being," da-da-da. So my first day of school (laughter) wasn't pleasant. Yeah, I got jumped on even before I got in the classroom. I don't remember much about kindergarten, except I probably didn't pay much attention. There was something between kindergarten and first grade, I can't remember what they called it. So I, I was in that for a while. Went to first grade. Somewhere in second grade I fell off the sliding board, almost cut the tip of my tongue off. And by the time I got to third grade, I think that's when I really started to take the lessons a little bit more serious. I had--in second grade I had a teacher named Mrs. Grand [ph.]. I don't remember my first or kindergarten teacher. But when I got third grade, I had a lady named Miss Key. And they said--oh Miss Keys [ph.], and, and coming into the class, everybody said Miss Keys does not play, and she didn't. And she was one of those teachers that knew that not only was she a good teacher, but she knew that she was bas- and we did have a few white students in the school, but not many. But she knew she was basically teaching African American students, so she specifically said these are the lessons that you're gonna have to take with you so that you can make it in the black or the white world.
Speaker 1: Was she a black teacher or white teacher (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, she was a black teacher. Now she didn't necessarily say black or white world, but she, you know, you understood what she was saying.
Speaker 1: Are there other teachers that stand out along the way?
Speaker 2: Oh absolutely. And I had a principal named Mr. Anthony [ph.]. Now Mr. Anthony, even when I was in high school [Woodrow Wilson High School, Washington, D.C.], if Mr. Anthony saw me at the bus stop, he'd pull over and ask me how I was doing 'cause I'd spent a lot of time in Mr. Anthony's office (laughter). You know, I had--I, I was kind of a trouble maker. I mean not like fistfights type trouble, but just you know, loud talk--I wanted to be the class clown. You know, so I was probably a disruptive student. You know, up until third grade. Third grade I had to pretty much clamp down a little bit.
Story_ID: 486310
Speaker 1: Can you tell me a story that would demonstrate your academic ability? Were you good in math or English?
Speaker 2: Well, I would say I really begin to notice--it really began to be more important to have my academic thing together once I went to fourth grade. Because somewhere in the third grade, about twelve of us from Davis [Davis Elementary School, Washington, D.C.] got a notice that we were being transferred to Randle Highlands Elementary [Randle Highlands Elementary School, Washington, D.C.] on 30th Street, and I do have my sixth grade picture for you all to photograph later. I keep this picture with me because it's--this was the beginning of my real education. So here I'm leaving a brand new school, cafeteria, auditorium, modern facilities, better books in my opinion, big, you know, play area. So now we go to 30th--we go to this school on 30th Street, Randle Highlands. Building built in 1911. It's got ten classrooms. It's got no auditorium, no cafeteria. The only advantage that I'm seeing on the first day of going to this school, is that it's majority white school. Otherwise, it's like well him, you know, in the South, you know it seems like the black students were going to the white schools because they had better facilities then the white schools. It seemed like this was the reverse. It's like wait a minute (laughter), I had better facilities where I was.
Speaker 1: For what year was this?
Speaker 2: Okay you gonna make me--ask me this--
Speaker 1: Was this on the heels of--
Speaker 2: So this would've been 1964.
Speaker 1: Okay, so this is desegregation?
Speaker 2: Right. This is after Brown versus Ed- the Board of Education [Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954] and also because there was still de facto segregation. What they were doing was moving certain groups of students around to try to make the schools a little bit more integrated, you know. And so I had no idea, but the twelve of us that were taken from Davis over to Randle Highlands prob- were skewed very highly academically. I'm like okay (laughter) glad you all told me 'cause I didn't know. And I remember that Mrs. Keys, or Miss Keys [ph.] gave us this very stern, it wasn't like stern like we had done something wrong, but this very stern talking to in terms of this is a very important experiment that you guys are participating in. So, even though you're gonna be leaving your comfort zone, you're gonna be leaving everything that you--that you--that you're familiar--don't ever not--don't ever doubt yourself that you can compete in this world and in this new environment.
Speaker 1: Do you remember your first experience at Randle? I mean so you're seeing these white kids for the first time, is that a shock or?
Speaker 2: Well yeah. I mean this is--I mean okay, this is, this is the thing that I was--that I was getting to, this is where my real education began. Because it wasn't so much that all of a sudden now being around white students was gonna make you smarter. But what happened with me was that now being in a mixed classroom, I could get rid of all these misconceptions that I have from only seeing white people on TV to actually asking a kid, well you know, do you get spankings or you know, what do you guys eat for breakfast, or you know, what kind of music do you guys listen to. And, and by the time, you know, I got to college [American University, Washington, D.C.], you know, I understood without any doubt. Yeah, there's smart white people, there's some not so smart white people. Some smart black people, not so smart black people. So in those early days, I think one of the first conversations I, I had with a kid sitting across from me was the fact that, you know, he, he was very lucky to be white because he didn't get spankings. He's like, "Really?" "Yeah, well on 'Leave It to Beaver' you know, you guys never get spanked." He said, "That's television."

Speaker 1: Were there other incidents where white students revealed what was going on behind the closed doors?
Speaker 2: Cheryl [Cheryl Butler], the thing that Randle Highlands [Randle Highlands Elementary School, Washington, D.C.] meant for me was now we could slowly, you know, but surely pull the veils back and you know, so I found out that there were white kids that came from broken homes or you know, mommy and daddy, you know, argued and whatever. You know I found out that there were so many things that the television which was really, you know, my only exposure to the so-called white folks. You know, it wa- it was entertainment, it wasn't--it wasn't--it didn't give a true portrayal of white people or black people, especially in those days, you know. So, I remember some of the--some of the female students, you know, would huddle off on the playground and talk about things, and I'd say, you know, "So what were you and you know, Katie talking about?" "Oh well you know, you know, she's afraid to tell her mom that, you know, she kind of has a crush on, on So and So and you know, he's a black kid," or whatever. I mean, you know, it, it was--a lot of it was innocent but all at the same time it really made me trust what Mrs. Keys [ph.] had told, told me and told the rest of us, you know, that we just had to really believe that we had a good foundation, we were gonna build on that foundation. There was a young lady in the class, a black girl, Diana Maxwell [ph.], smart as a whip, a certified genius. And Diana and I would always win the so-called memorization contests. You know, the [U.S.] Constitution, the Declaration of Independence or whatever. We would do a lot of those sort of things. There was a gentleman named Jonathan Farmer [ph.]. I think Jonathan was a wiz at math, but Ronald Colbert [ph.] really was the math genius. Each one of us had--had different skills. A few of us had, you know, some musical background. I was just starting my musical training by that time. So, by the time we got to sixth grade, you know, I really felt a lot more, I felt a lot better about my chances in this world. And even though I'd had no idea what I wanted to do, I just knew that this whole, you know, meeting of the races wasn't as gonna be--wasn't gonna be as cataclysmic as they portrayed it on television.
Speaker 1: Do you know the percentage of whites to blacks at that school, roughly?
Speaker 2: I would say roughly 80 percent white, 20 percent black.
Story_ID: 486312
Speaker 1: And you mentioned also that you were getting some of your instruction from TV?
Speaker 2: Well yeah, yeah (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So tell me about what you witnessed on TV, number one there's news and news accounts of what's going on vis-a-vis desegregation and there's also entertainment?
Speaker 2: Right. At the time that I'm watching television and I'm going through the '50s [1950s] and the early '60s [1960s], you know, we had maybe one black star and that was Nat Cole [Nat King Cole], and his show ['The Nat King Cole Show'] was only on for fifteen minutes and I don't think it went more than a couple months because they couldn't find a sponsor.
Speaker 1: When you saw Nat Cole, what caught your eye?
Speaker 2: Well, I mean, I was familiar with Nat Cole only because, you know, anytime you heard a record that--of Nat Cole singing everybody would stop and say that's Nathaniel, you know, and our parent's chest would stick out or any, you know, any, any time anybody black was doing something back then, you know, the whole community's chest would pump up, you know, whether it was boxing, music, you know, letters, whatever. So television was essentially a canyon, a vast canyon where you never saw black people, either they were in trouble or every now and then you would see an entertainer, you would see, you know, Sammy Davis, you know, break through on the show. You would see, you know, Nat Cole. And it was very rare, you definitely would not see black people pitching products, you know, in commercials, not gonna happen.
Speaker 1: Did you identify with people like Sammy Davis, Jr. and Nat King Cole? Did you think, you know, one I would like to be a part of that world?
Speaker 2: Well I knew that one day that at least you could have maybe some sort of role in entertainment or, or something where the cameras and, and, you know, and people knew your name when you walked down the street and looked at you as a celebrity. But I didn't really see myself as someone in front of the camera, you know. So, I said, you know, good for them 'cause I, I knew I couldn't kick the heels around like Sammy Davis, forget about it. I may have had a comedy you know outlet at some point, 'cause I was always be--being a fool in class. But that doesn't necessarily mean you have any material that's gonna be, you know, good enough to get you on television. But, you know, little by little you would see, you know, you might see Nipsey Russell, you might see Redd Foxx, you know, you might, you know, I remember when 'Julia,' you know, came on the air with [HistoryMaker] Diahann Carroll and that was actually the first black person to star in a television, you know, show, you know, on a regular basis. And then Cosby [Bill Cosby] and--and Robert Culp had 'I Spy.' You know so slowly but surely you started seeing, you know, black people in specific, you know, roles coming onto television. But you knew there was a difference in, in the news realm in terms of news anchors, it wasn't 'til much later, I would say probably in the '70s [1970s] before we saw like someone like a Max Robinson, and even locally, even with the--D.C. [Washington, D.C.] still being probably 85 percent black in 1970, there was a group here called BEST, Black Efforts for Soul in Television, that sued all the local stations. That gave us the [HistoryMaker] Jim Vance and at the time Max Robinson on Channel 9 [WUSA-TV, Washington, D.C.]. And on Channel 5 [WTTG-TV, Washington, D.C.], Larry Bryant, who's passed away and was one of my early mentors. You know, they actually had to sue these stations to get a black presence in local television.
Story_ID: 486313
Speaker 1: So, having access to kids my age, but you know, they had red hair, blond hair, brunette. You know, they had freckles or whatever, it just gave me a opportunity to--to sit down and say well how do you feel about--do you like baseball, you like football, you know, just things that kids talk about. But every now and then we, we would have to talk about things that were--that were--and things that were affecting all of us and also early news footage about this war in Indochina, which later on we, you know, we came to know as Vietnam.
Speaker 2: Um-hm. So were you aware of these social issues? I mean partly you have the news coming into your home, so you know, at this time you're hearing about civil rights and the unrest, especially in the South, but some of it filtering through here in D.C. [Washington, D.C.]. And then later you're hearing about Vietnam, so how are you processing all of this?
Speaker 1: Well, I remember asking my--my mom [Williams' maternal aunt, Ruth Robinson Harshaw] the question about, you know, you know, why are we Negroes or why do we have to be Negroes. That was, that was--that was definitely in elementary school. After I left Randle Highlands [Randle Highlands Elementary School, Washington, D.C.] in sixth grade, I went to Kramer Junior High [Kramer Junior High School; Kramer Middle School], which is in Southeast [Washington, D.C.] over near the Anacostia River. And that's about the time I really began to, you know, kind of feel a little bit more, you know, political I mean would be the word later on. I really began to, to notice the certain subtle ways that, you know, people may talk to you, either patr- patronizingly or just straight up talk down to you or maybe they treat, in my mind, the black kids a little different from the white kids.
Speaker 2: Was this a mixed school as well?
Speaker 1: Yes. And Kramer--Kramer was, was kind of like a great barometer of white flight, because when, when we came into Kramer, it, it--the--in the fall of '64 [1964], yeah I would say it was easily, easily 70--70 percent white at the time. By the time I left three years later, it was probably maybe 50/50. You know, (laughter) and I'm sure, you know, by the next year it was 60/40 black to white and then on down. You can look at my graduation picture, which I also have with me. And some of those kids that are in that picture were with me at Randle Highlands, which meant that their parents pretty much stayed in the D.C. area. A lot of them, just whoosh, you know, went over to Maryland. I remember seeing the--I remember seeing the police arrest some kid outside the fence of Kramer. And it, it seemed like, you know, the kid was, you know, obeying the police officer's instructions, because we were playing basketball, you know, just kind of fooling around and you know, off in the distance we saw, you know, a police car roll up on this kid who was walking down the street. Maybe he--maybe he was truant, but whatever, whatever happened, I don't know whether he said something to the cop, but next thing I know, billy club was out, whap, whap, whap, this guy's on the ground. He's being dragged to the police car, which by that time had kind of, you know, attracted more of us up against the fence and we were yelling and screaming, and, and the counselors and all--and the other monitors that were on the, the field started to push us, "Go back to class, go back to class, you know, it's none of your business." So after that, I was, you know, I was thinking I immediately went to the water hoses in Birmingham [Alabama] and you know, the Pettus Bridge [Edmund Pettus Bridge], you know, in Selma [Alabama]. I was like, okay that--that's not gonna happen here in D.C. You know, and I'm sure a lot worse than that has happened in D.C., but in terms of that was one of the first incidents I saw with my own eyes.
Speaker 2: So you're doing this, it seems, constant comparison the images on TV versus real life?
Speaker 1: Absolutely. We're, we're looking at what is being portrayed as something going on in one part of the country, as if it's just those bad people down south. But I'm becoming aware that, you know--you know, we got a few problems right here (laughter), you know, right here in D.C., the so-called nation's capital. And again, going back to that area in South Capitol Street where you have people that are still, at that time, probably by '67 [1967] they had--they had torn down that development. But it really kind of showed you there were two different worlds, even here in Wash- I mean you go further back into the history of D.C., I mean Georgetown [Washington, D.C.] was a black area, it wasn't posh and it wasn't the desirable high-value real estate it is now. So, you know, there have been several areas where you wouldn't associate with one race where the other race had been and then it switched back and forth.
Story_ID: 486314
Speaker 1: Yesterday, former Baltimore [Maryland] mayor, [HistoryMaker] Kurt Schmoke, was talking about the March on Washington and those images. Do you remember the March on Washington?
Speaker 2: Oh absolutely. My, my [maternal] aunt, Mary Jane [Mary Robinson], went to the march. I begged my mother to go with her. She was going with one of her church buddies, another Seventh-day Adventist, and my mom, Ruth [Williams' maternal aunt, Ruth Robinson Harshaw], was--she was a fraidy-cat. She was afraid of all of--she was afraid of anybody getting into any of the civil rights, you know, demonstrations. So, I was like--to this day I regret not being able to go down with mom, because I mean nothing happened. A lot of people sweated, but they heard, you know, some great presentations and of course principally, you know Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.]. I went to the Solidarity Day thing a few years later that--that was on, you know, on the Mall [National Mall, Washington, D.C.] and I was in Los Angeles [California] for the Million Man March, but I came back for the Million More [sic. Millions More]. But there were a lot of other things that I participated in, especially by the time I got here to American U [American University, Washington, D.C.] as an undergrad, which was anti-Vietnam [Vietnam War] demonstrations (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Story_ID: 486315
Speaker 1: And so you went to high school though at Woodrow Wilson [Woodrow Wilson High School, Washington, D.C.] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I went to high school at Wilson. That, that's an interesting story. I was supposed to gone to Anacostia [Anacostia High School, Washington, D.C.], which is a block away from Kramer Junior High [Kramer Junior High School; Kramer Middle School, Washington, D.C.]. And on the registration day, there were so many people waiting in line literally to get into the school just to do their paperwork, a woman came out, maybe an assistant principal and said, "Look if you wanna get into a school today, there's a bus here that's going to Western [Western High School; Duke Ellington School of the Arts, Washington, D.C.]--there's a bus here that's going to Wilson, and you just jump on either one of those buses and you can get registered today." So, having ridden around with my dad [Williams' maternal uncle, James Harshaw], I knew where Western was. I said, "There is no Wilson, there is no Wilson High School in D.C. [Washington, D.C.]." I said, "It's in D.C.?" She said, "Yes in D.C." I said, "There's no Wilson." So I got on the Wilson bus just to see where it was. And I realized I had never seen that high school. I had never--for some reason, even in hacking which is, you know, slang for driving a cab, we had never, you know, at least while I was with my dad, we had never come past that part of Nebraska Avenue. So I ended up going to Wilson.
Speaker 1: What kind of school was this racially?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Wilson was easily 80 percent white at the time in, in '69 [1969], '70 [1970]. By the time I left, I would say it was 30 percent black, 30 percent international, and 30 percent white. Because at the time, there were a lot of students whose parents were in the diplomatic corps. So it was really a miniature United Nations [UN].
Speaker 1: And share with us a story that would document this new experience, this new multicultural experience?
Speaker 2: Well, the multicultural aspect of, of Wilson wasn't fully appreciated until some of us in the then black student unions staged a walkout in January of 1970. And in the walkout in, in part of the paperwork that we presented to the school, we had mentioned that we would like that the assemblies that you have, you know, 'cause you know, you have your school assemblies, your band plays, your chorus comes out and then they do--okay, well that's fine, well can we hear something from the students from Indonesia one time or the students from South America one time or the students, you know, from other parts of the world who are here, you know. And, as well as, you know, of course the great European masters. And okay we have something from Africa every now and then, you know, because we're not gonna get this opportunity again. But most of the inter- intercultural exchanges were really like in classroom discussions and people having lunch together, and you know, maybe at certain sports activities. Because the, the--some of the foreign students had been probably told, you know, you stay away from those black kids, you know. But once they realize that for the most part the black kids at this school were, you know, some of the--I guess Du Bois [W.E.B. Du Bois] would've called some of the Talented Tenth. You know, so we, we were about the books and we were about, you know, let's get this, let's all get into college. I mean Wilson was one of the few high schools I knew in the D.C. area that had a whole room dedicated, that they called the college bureau. So we had admissions information from just about every school around the country. They'd help you with the applications and all of that.
Story_ID: 486316
Speaker 1: You mentioned earlier that you started taking music lessons. Can you talk to me about music in high school (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay, all right. Well what happened with me, Cheryl [Cheryl Butler], is, is I had to go to church weekly with my mom [Williams' maternal aunt, Ruth Robinson Harshaw] and dad [Williams' maternal uncle, James Harshaw]. So at some point when we were at our--I went to Israel C.M.E. Church [Israel Metropolitan Christian Methodist Episcopal Church], which is at 7th [Street] and Randolph [Street] Northwest [Washington, D.C.]. We started on New Jersey Avenue and moved there, I, I can't remember what year, but it was a very impressive first day in our new church. We had a great choir, a great organist, a lady named Helen Penn, and they--the choir got into this Negro spiritual called 'I Hear a Voice A-Praying.' And they did such a wonderful job that morning that I had tears in my eyes. And everybody, you know, all the old folks in the church they were kind of ribbing my mom, they were saying, "I thought--I think Russell [HistoryMaker Russell Williams, II] got called to preach this morning." I'm like no, but I did get called to take some music lessons (laughter), now that's really what happened to me. It's like whatever the minister was saying, I have no idea, but I need to learn about some of those chords and some of that harmony, it really spoke to me. So I started taking piano lessons in the church with this--our--then choir director Robert Shaw, and then after that I--my parents were kind enough to pay for private lessons with a lady named Cloretta Proctor [ph.], who was in Southeast [Washington, D.C.] at the time. I think she's in Maryland now. And she suggested to me, wise beyond, you know, her years. She says well, you know, you need to play another instrument like a band instrument or an ensemble instrument, because the experience of playing as a soloist all the time is not a complete musical experience. You need to get the experience of playing in an ensemble. So--and this--she told me this while I was still in junior high. So I'm like okay. So I went to the band room at Kramer [Kramer Junior High School; Kramer Middle School, Washington, D.C.] and I wanna say our orchestra director's name was Mrs. Lockhart [ph.]. Nice little old white lady. She kind of reminded me of Aunt Bee [Aunt Bee Taylor] on 'Mayberry' ['Mayberry R.F.D.'], on 'The Andy Griffith Show.' 'Cause 'Mayberry' came later, was a spinoff. So I'm looking in this room and she was already excited I could already read music. She says, "Well why don't you take the violin, I have a violin, I have a clarinet." I said, "Look I don't wanna learn another hard instrument, give me something easy." So I--there was this old beat up tuba sitting in the corner in no case, right. She says, "Well I really--I really could use a tuba player," and I said yeah, how hard could--I--I'm thinking in my mind how hard could a tuba part be right. So I grabbed the tuba and you know, walked to the bus stop, get on the bus. Everybody's laughing I mean I got this old beat up tuba. But the beauty of having piano experiences now, I can just take the sheet music, I can sound the note and then I can find the note on the piano to see if I'm sounding the right notes since you only have three fingers. And some in the bigger concert tubas you have four. But at least you can figure out what, you can play several notes on each finger. So am I on the right pitch. So I figured that out, man one weekend and I was playing with the band. So now I get to Wilson [Woodrow Wilson High School, Washington, D.C.], now the tuba parts look like violin parts. I'm like, uh-oh. I mean it's like going (laughter) (gesture). So I never got to taking private lessons on the tuba, but that was another interesting experience. We had a 100-piece concert band and we had four, four tubas in this band, and I'm the only black guy in the tuba section. And one of the kids, this is--I'm at Wilson when Martin Luther King, Jr. [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] gets killed. And we had some assembly a day--the very next day, you know, so that we have a kind of like a school prayer and try to calm the situation down. And you know, maybe even begin a dialogue.
Story_ID: 486317
Speaker 1: And so the next morning in band, maybe, maybe we had a weekend, you know, 'cause D.C. [Washington, D.C.] did burn, you know (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right. Were you--do you have memories of that?
Speaker 1: Oh absolutely 'cause I had to catch the 30 bus from Wilson [Woodrow Wilson High School, Washington, D.C.] over cross the Southeast [Washington, D.C.]. So you actually traversed the entire city and there were smoke and flames pretty much across the entire city, except in actual downtown. I, I will also say that's one of the last times that anybody can remember the traffic moving smoothly in D.C. This is once the National Guard came in 'cause they were moving cars in and out of D.C. like, okay this is what we do. We move convoys. So you could get from downtown out to the suburbs in like ten minutes (makes noise). After the National Guard left, it was back to being gridlocked.
Speaker 2: And do you remember getting the news that King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was assassinated?
Speaker 1: Yes, 'cause--I'm trying to remember, I think we were watching--what were we watching--we were watching something on the evening news and--not evening news but one of the evening shows and that news came across. And then I wanna say I either tuned into WOL Radio [Washington, D.C.] and, and started hearing, you know, some of the reports. Okay 'cause--so that's, that's the white people's version on television, so let's turn on the local radio and hear our version of it. So, you know, there were, there were rumblings that night, you know, around the U Street area, 14th Street area. We came to school the next day, we ended up having a half a day of school because, you know, it seemed like, you know, there were more restless natives then they had thought. So in that trip across town, I mean I saw a whole lot--a whole lot of violence.
Speaker 2: Describe what you saw?
Speaker 1: I just saw people, you know, I say for instance, up in Upper Northwest [Washington, D.C.], I remember at one of the bus stops I wanna say, I wanna say some of the kids on the bus in front of us got off the bus and started smacking, you know, some white folks around, you know, in Georgetown [Washington, D.C.], just at random. I think by the time we got down to--'cause this bus goes down M Street--it goes down Pennsylvania Avenue and by the time we got to the Archives Building [National Archives Building] at 7th [Street] and Penn [Washington, D.C.], I think, you know, people were--there was really not like exactly stones and things to throw, but people were like throwing things at people on Pennsylvania Avenue. But you were seeing plumes of smoke, you know, in, in the distance in various places. I remember one guy scared me to death. He was running by--running by--running past the bus with a .45 in his hand, tell me are we gonna get our get back now or get our payback now. I'm like okay, this is getting a little wild now (laughter). And, and we almost immediately, you know, you started seeing signs in the black-owned businesses like soul brother or black owned, or things like that. You know, but there, there was just a lot of just random, just, just attacking people at random.
Speaker 2: What was your sense, I mean at this point you'd been exposed to a multicultural academic setting--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: How did you assess what was going on?
Speaker 1: Well, I mean I was definitely angry that Martin Luther King was killed because in my opinion, that sent the message that, you know, here's, here's a man who came in peace and came in conciliation, so if you don't wanna hear what he has to say, okay, then, then you're really gonna reap the whirlwind. I didn't understand necessarily the wisdom of burning up our own neighborhoods. I mean our specific neighborhood out in Southeast didn't burn per se, but I know that the 7-Eleven at the time was a 7-Eleven, I don't think it still is, but that was probably the most surprising thing to me. The 7-Eleven right out on Benning Road went up like a fireball, you know. There was a lot of looting, you know, all across town and so that would've been probably my second vivi- most vivid memory especially as you get up and down H Street and those, you know, commercial areas, people breaking windows and coming out with TVs and clothes, and next thing you know guys have got a bunch of stuff in the back of their car, you know. And I'm thinking, okay well this is one way to demonstrate your dissatisfaction, but on the other hand, you know, we--we've essentially penalized our own self. You know, we haven't gone up into Upper Northwest, you know, or down and looted these government buildings, whomever you wanna really wanna blame for this. And a lot of areas in D.C., you can still see the remnants of the sixty--'68 [1968] riots. I mean there are a lot of areas that are still just empty lots. Now U Street has made an amazing recovery. But, you know, if you look close enough you'll say hey there's--nothing has been on that corner since, you know, '68 [1968], since April 14th, 1968, April 4th, 1968.
Story_ID: 486318
Speaker 1: At this time, music was a way for you to sort of express your emotions (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, the music for me was--I, I learned early on when I was taking piano that music is that--that salve for the savage beast. And, and my mom [Williams' maternal aunt, Ruth Robinson Harshaw] would say something to me, make me very angry, you know, and at this point I'm not playing anything complicated, so I say okay, I'm gonna go downstairs and get on the piano. What I'm gonna do is I'm gonna bang on this piano so loud it's gonna disturb her upstairs while she is watching her soap opera, which ever that may have been. So I, you know, I did that for a couple of minutes. And then after a while I'm like okay well I got that out of me, so well I might as well do my lesson while I'm here. So I started, you know, working my little lesson, (imitates piano). And then after about ten minutes, I still and to this day I can't remember what I was angry about. And I was like, now how come I can't remember why I was angry about. And I was like well I guess, you know, the music just took me someplace else. So I really then started paying attention to any music that I really liked and any music I didn't like. And it didn't really--wasn't because you say well this is a Ray Charles record, I'm gonna automatically like it. I either liked it, it either touched or it didn't touch me.
Speaker 1: Who was touching you, people like Duke Ellington, a native--
Speaker 2: Well at the time, I mean I was--I was listening to a lot of symphonic stuff, so a lot of Beethoven [Ludwig van Beethoven], a lot of Mozart [Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart], a lot of Chopin [Frederic Chopin].
Speaker 1: Classical music?
Speaker 2: Yeah, because that's what I was playing on the piano, European classical music. 'Cause my neighbors were playing American classical music, which is commonly known as jazz. So some of the first jazz I was getting into and this is like mid to late '60s [1960s], Jimmy Smith on the organ, [HistoryMaker] Ramsey Lewis on piano, Oscar Peterson on piano, you know, because I was keyboard player I, I was kind of listening to what they were doing. But then, bu- slowly someone turned me on to this guitar player named Wes Montgomery. I said that was kind of nice. And then I kind of eased into this guy named Miles Davis, and then, you know, all of a sudden I start--you know, it wasn't until--I think I started listening to, to Duke and Mingus [Charles Mingus] and other people that had orchestras or bands, once I got into the, the concert band at school. Because I said man, it--and Basie [Count Basie] especially. I said man it's really difficult to get a hundred people to play all at the same time and to play the same thing. And you listen to the Basie band (snaps fingers), it's like, you know, they used to--it's a joke when we say you could set your watch by the Basie band, because their timekeeping was--and then you listen to the Duke Ellington band and all these really difficult clarinet parts. I never appreciated clarinet until I listened to Duke Ellington's group, Russell Procope and Jimmy Hamilton. I--'cause most clarinet players in high school and junior high, you know, they squeak all the time, you know. So you, I'm just--I'm getting ready for that and I'm like, well that didn't squeak, now these guys know what they're doing, you know. And then I started listening to a little bit more radical music, you know, especially as, as more of the United States started to catch on fire. I started to listen to more people like Coltrane [John Coltrane], Archie Shepp, you know. By the time I got to college [American University, Washington, D.C.] it was people like Sun Ra. I mean, of course, you know, there was Cannonball Adderley, you know, 'Country Preacher,' that sort of thing. So, it, there, there was--there were different levels of appreciation.
Story_ID: 486319
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well what year did you graduate Woodrow Wilson [Woodrow Wilson High School, Washington, D.C.]?
Speaker 2: From Wilson I came out in 1970.
Speaker 1: And did you immediately enter American [American University, Washington, D.C.], if so why (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes. Well it's funny. I was, at the time, I decided I wanted--somewhere in the last year of--I think my music teacher, not Mrs. Proctor [Cloretta Proctor (ph.)], but this gentleman named Wilfred McKenzie [ph.] who was trained at Peabody [Peabody Conservatory of Music; Peabody Institute, Baltimore, Maryland], an incredible pianist. He told me about the life in the conservatory, and he told me about people jumping out of windows because of their tests. I'm like, well hell, I don't think I wanna to conservatory, even though I probably could've passed some of those tests without any problems. But, you know, I just started--I think I psyched myself out. I, I really enjoyed music in such a way that I didn't wanna be forced to have to play all this stuff, all day, all night, you know, and, and not make a career out of it. I really just wanted to play for my own pleasure. I didn't really necessarily wanna be a pianist as my, my bread and butter. So that's when I thought--started thinking about communications. And I thought about Univ- Boston University [Boston, Massachusetts], but it just so happened that a few of the black students from the black student union at American came down to one of our meetings at Wilson and said, hey, you know, think about American. Let's tell you about what we have over here and I ended up coming here, you know. I said why pay all that tuition money, I mean residence hall money, I could just go across town. 'Cause I, I really love D.C. [Washington, D.C.] and even though I did have one cousin in Boston [Massachusetts], I really didn't feel that, you know, good about Boston, you know.

Speaker 1: Tell me about your first memories on the campus of American University [Washington, D.C.]?
Speaker 2: I have a real fond memory, my first day of school at American. I had probably come up here a couple times during the summer just to kind of get the lay of the land. But, the first day of school our building that houses the School of Communication, which didn't exist at that time, it's--it was just part of the College of Arts and Sciences, but we've gotten more sophisticated now. It's called the Mary Graydon Center [Washington, D.C.]. And say--it was also, and still is, a student center where most of the activities that anybody from any other schools would come to, you know, have a beer at the tavern or come, you know, have meetings with the rest of the organizations, et cetera. I'm sitting on the front steps and it's kind of like being back in elementary school or high school the first day, except the kids are bigger. 'Cause it's, you know, a lot of white students, not too many brown faces, and the quad is laid out with these diagonal walkways. Well off to my left diagonal, I see this gentleman off in the distance with a big Afro, sunglasses and then as he gets a little closer I realize he has, you know, not deformed bow legs, but you know, prominent bow legs and as he gets closer I realize he has on some khakis, some penny loafers. He's looking, you know, decidedly preppy. And he's got a big moustache, and he's still looking. And he's got--he's got my eye, I've got his eye and he's coming dead at me. And he's got his hand out maybe twenty-five yards before he gets to the front steps and he says, "Luther Forrest [ph.], St. Louis [Missouri]. I didn't think there were any other black people on this campus," and he was just shaking my hand (laughter) and I was shaking his hand. I say, "Hey, I'm Russell Williams [HistoryMaker Russell Williams, II], I'm a native Washingtonian." "Hey man what are you majoring in?" I said, "Communications man." He said, "I wanna go to law man." You know, so--so we, we began a really, really, really tight friendship, started from the first day. And then probably after some registration snafus and some kind of like finding where this building was and that building, then I started to see--in--inside the Mary Graydon Center was a section of the--our little tavern where all the black kids sat and it was unofficially or officially named Amen Corner. So that began to be your daily stop. If you were on campus, you would have to spend some time at the Amen Corner, catch up on the gossip, maybe play a hand or two of bid whist. But the other thing that made coming to American U, you know, now in hindsight it was like a genius move was that the so-called black student union, which was called OASATAU, which I believe that acronym if I remember correctly was Organization of African and African American Students at American University [Organization of African and Afro-American Students at American University]. Whew, it's a mouthful, I should get an award for remembering that. I think, I wanna say they had their office--the office was on the second or third floor of this--of Mary Graydon. But anyway, the students who had come before us were real pioneers and they were dedicated to any black student coming to this school and getting out, I mean not getting out like leaving, but getting out with their credentials. And they had dossiers, that's the only way I could put it, on just about every professor in that school. What kind of test they give, what ki- what they expect in class, what they expect for the homework. Do they have, you know, any racial biases that are obvious. So if you needed to take chemistry, you know, you might wanna take it from this person 'cause this person is gonna grade you on your work and this person is gonna grade you on your color. And they had tutoring, they had any--they would put together any little ad hoc sort of group to help you or a group of you get through a course or get through a field. I mean, their, their whole attitude was, you know, black should mean excellence. It shouldn't mean, I mean the Amen Corner was, was something social, you know everybody has a life, you know, take a deep breath, you know, kick your heels up, talk some trash, you know, 'cause I mean we had people from all over the country here. You know, so we had Chi-Town [Chicago, Illinois], New York [New York], you know, Deep South, West Coast, you know, and a lot of D.C. [Washington, D.C.] people as well. So, you know, there was that side of it, but when the time came to roll your sleeves up and get the work done, the people who came in front of us, the people who would've been graduating the year I came in 1970 for example or maybe the very next year, they had set up a, a standard that, you know, they expected everybody else to go for and also because we were still relatively new in this whole process of being black at a so-called white university, you know, it still meant something collectively. In other words, you didn't wanna be looked at as the person that was bringing everybody else down, you know. And if so your reading wasn't up to speed, you know, you don't have to announce it, we'll help you over here on the side, you know.
Speaker 1: Wow, it's pretty progressive?
Speaker 2: It was very progressive. I don't--I don't even know, even though I'm a professor here, I don't even know--I mean there are black student organizations, but I'm not sure whether the urgency is the same. Because I think as a professor here I can tell that the white students here are completely different in most cases then the ones that I took classes with. Because they have grown up in a more multicultural, you know, they've been exposed to a lot more in their young years then--then I was in my years, be- because they've seen black successful people, Asian successful people, Latino successful people, as well as black unsuccessful--
Story_ID: 486335
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So who were the white students you attended American University [Washington, D.C.] with at that time? I mean is there an incident that would describe either the tensions or the relationships?
Speaker 2: Well, an incident. I mean, the, the, the white students that were at American in the '70s [1970s] were basically hippies, anti-war, and there was maybe a pretty sa- a pretty serious corps of, of conservative, you know, pro-Republican, pro-war, you know, type students. But they, they really weren't vocal, you know, they really didn't wanna get out in the middle of the quad and voice their position.
Speaker 1: Well tell me about some of those protests, the anti-war protests?
Speaker 2: The protest scene in the '70s [1970s] was, was kind of like--it was almost to the point where you couldn't get to class. For some reason, I remember, AU and only because I was on this campus, but AU was a staging ground for two or three big anti-war demonstrations. Meaning that people who came in from out of town would be camping out on the stairwells, camping out on the, you know, in front of buildings on the quad. In the case spiritual, they'd be making signs, they'd be printing up leaflets. They'd have kind of like a pep talk--pep rally, you know, at AU before you got on the bus or public transportation or march down to, to the Mall [National Mall, Washington, D.C.] for the real demonstration.
Speaker 1: Were you an activist?
Speaker 2: I did, I did a few of those demonstrations because I, I, I really began to understand, now we're in the middle of this Iraq War, which yeah I think most people would agree, unfortunately for the [U.S.] military that's exposed to--to the, to the situation in Iraq and the people of Iraq, you know, that the whole thing was really a sham about oil. Okay, it wasn't about WMDs [weapons of mass destruction] and security and terrorist brewing in Iraq that planned 9/11 [September 11, 2001]. There has been no credible information to support that. Vietnam [Vietnam War] essentially was also a sham. And I remember my attitude was, okay if, if Vietnam falls and the rest of Southeast Asia would fall to Communist aggression, et cetera, et cetera, I'm like well fine. When the Communist get to Mexico City [Mexico] give me a ring. But, you know, I see between us and them there's this big ocean and they don't have a blue water navy, they don't have a real supersonic air force, you know, what I'm saying and they don't have this standing army that they've used to, to, you know, take over other people's, you know lands, and they definitely haven't expressed any interest in coming over here and starting any trouble, so why am I going over there, you know. And it, it I remember Ali [Muhammad Ali] in the movie 'Ali,' one of the few scenes that I thought Will Smith really portrayed Ali was the scene after the boxing commission meeting where he comes out and he says, you know, when I'm looking for a job, you're my oppressor, you know, when I'm looking for rights and freedom, you're my--I remember that news clip, I remember Ali doing that. And I said that makes--that made a whole lot of sense to me. He says yeah no Vietnamese ever called me a nigger. That made a lot of sense to me. That's, that's all I needed to hear. The, the, the fact that I got drafted in the lottery and didn't have to go was, was more of an act of God.
Story_ID: 486336
Speaker 1: When were you drafted?
Speaker 2: So what year was I nineteen, that would've been '71 [1971], and the year before my, my birthday was something like 320 in the lottery, okay. The year that it mattered, my birthday came up something like seven or eight. I'm like ah, you know, all your major newspapers had this big block of numbers, right under the big, you know, your banner and it'd say--would say, you know, January 1 is like say 212, January 2 is 32, so but it was in the order of whatever number that they had picked. So October 14th was like less than 10 in that lottery and I was like, okay. I think maybe three or four days later, here's a letter from the Selective Service [Selective Service System]. And--so okay now all of, all of my beliefs are on the line now. Do I go to Canada, 'cause I'm not really interested in going in this war [Vietnam War]? You know, I'm in college [American University, Washington, D.C.], there's no more college deferment. Okay, I'm not even sure whether there's a conscientious objector, you know, deferment. So you, you get called up. You go, you meet at that time outside the, the [U.S.] General Accounting Office. Or actually we were outside what was called the Pension Building [National Building Museum, Washington, D.C.]. An old Civil War era a red brick building. Put us on a bus, take us up to Fort Holabird in Baltimore [Maryland], I said okay. So now I'm on U.S. Army property, right. You gotta take a written test, you had to take a physical. So I say well okay if I do have to go in, then I better do good on this written test 'cause I know all they really want to do is put an M16 in my hand and put me on the front line. But maybe I can get a radio operator's job or something, you know, a little safer, if I end up going. So I did the written test and then you go through the physical, you know eye, ear, nose and throat, bend over, you know, lift this leg up and then he reflexed this, all this junk. Then give some blood, you know. And you're sitting out there in your underwear with all these other recruits. So at some point, a corpsman, a medical corpsman says, "Williams [HistoryMaker Russell Williams, II], Williams, Russell." I said, "Here sir." He says, "Front and center." So I get up and kind of--I had taken--I had been in ROTC [Reserve Officers' Training Corps] so I tried to act like I was somewhat military, but I was like, you know. I get in this guy's office. He says--he shows me this test tube. He says, "You know what's in this test tube Williams?" I said, "Yeah blood." He says, "You know what's in the blood?" I said, "Well red corpuscles, white corpuscles." He says, "Syphilis." So I said, "Well that's--." And then I said well maybe I shouldn't be truthful right here, you know. I said, you know, that, "Bet it was that damn hooker on 14th [Street] and T [Street], had to be." I said, "So what does that mean?" He says, "Well, it means you can't come into this--this man's army with this dreaded disease." And I was like, "Oh bummer." "That's no laughing matter Williams," da-da-da-da-da-da-da, you know. I said, "I'm sorry sir. So what, what is my course of action?" "Well, you go to your local medical professional and yo- you'll get the cure and as soon as you're cured and we get the paperwork, you're 1A, you're going to Vietnam." I said okay (laughter). I said to myself, yeah like hell you'll ever get that paperwork. So I came back out and sat on the bench and I, you know, people can say that God doesn't, you know, show his hand in modern history, it's like I don't think you're paying attention. As far as I'm concerned, the Red Sea parted. Okay, there's no way I had syphilis, but in any case I went to the Upshur Street clinic [Washington, D.C.]. Just to show you the difference in medical--in, in, in the medical timing is. Now you can give blood this hour and in maybe three hours you can have your results. They said, don't do anything for two or three weeks. I'm like, don't worry about it. So two or three weeks later they call me back and they say, "Well Mr. Williams your blood test came back and we didn't find anything. There was no sas--." I said, "You know, look, look, look the Army was sure, you know, so I don't you incompetent public health people tell--I want you to test me again because I don't wanna mistakes about the Army, you know, Army doctor, you know." So I kept, I kept them testing me, you know, 'til Nixon [President Richard Milhous Nixon] decided to bring all these people back home. You know, I said like hell you're gonna get this paperwork (laughter), you know, I'm not sending that in. You know, so I mean they never found anything. So somebody in that gr- group had syphilis named Williams, but it wasn't me.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) But it wasn't you.
Speaker 2: You know, but I said you know what, I think I'll take this, I'll take this little opportunity right here. 'Cause all they would've done was give me another test, found out that they had made a mistake, and who knows, I could've gotten a Congressional Medal of Honor, or I could have a bunch of south- South Asian mud over top of me right now, who knows, I mean. My friends that did go to, to the war who were old--a little bit older tha- than me, they all came back physically, but they never really came back, you know, so.
Speaker 1: So maybe that was grace?
Speaker 2: I, I--hey I am not mad at all. I'll take that as just one miracle that I have witnessed myself, just one.
Story_ID: 486337
Speaker 1: Quickly before we move beyond American University [Washington, D.C.], were you still active in music?
Speaker 2: Well, when I was at American I, I played, you know, a little impromptu jazz ensembles here and there, but my real music interest shifted from being a performer so much, you know actually playing an instrument, to another student and I decided to petition the local radio station for some airtime because back then and you know, we never wanted to resemble the comment and as you go back to, to quotes, we never wanted to resemble that comment that used to be bandied about, more--I think more in my dad's time and before then now, but it--probably apply now too. So if you wanna hide something from a black person, put it in a book. So we never wanted to resemble that remark to go back to the Bowery Boys. So in, in--and also being kind of associated with the gentleman that ran BEST [Black Efforts for Soul in Television], as a communications attorney he said that the FCC [Federal Communications Commission] regulations state that the city of license for any broadcast facility dictates what that facility should broadcast. So at that time WAMU-FM [WAMU Radio, Washington, D.C.] broadcast pretty much nothing but European classical music and of course there were a NPR [National Public Radio] outlet as they still are. But they didn't really have anything aimed at the so-called black community and the black listening audience. They said well we don't really have that many black listeners. So we were like yeah why, I wonder why, gee, nobody, you know. So we said we just wanted to have a little two or three-hour show and at that time they weren't on the air twenty-four hours. So on Saturdays I don't think they came on the air until noon. So we said if we could get maybe a couple hours before noon that weren't part of your broadcast schedule anyway and do a show with black public affairs and jazz, and other black classical music, maybe some campus events, et cetera, et cetera. And so we--Ger- Gerald Lee [Gerald Bruce Lee] was the gentleman's name who's now a federal judge over in Alexandria [Virginia]. We loaded up for bear with all these documents and all these precedents and all, 'cause he, he was still undergrad, but of course he's practicing for his big--his big role as an attorney. And we, we had decided who was gonna play the good cop, who was gonna play the bad cop. Someone had to get an FCC license, and my, my mentor Larry Bryant over at Channel 5 [WTTG-TV, Washington, D.C.], you know, helped me with what I would have to know in order to get the FCC, at that time, third class radio telephone license. And so we, we also would have to probably get one of their engineers to help us engineer until we learned how to do the, you know, the board ourselves. But when we went to this meeting with the production man--with the station manager and the production dir- program director, I'm sorry, we were expecting all this resistance, and you know, they came in and says, "Oh you know what we're gonna do, we're gonna give you a 10:00 to 12:00 show, 10--10:00 to 12:00 slot, were gonna do this, do this, gonna put you with Bill Brown" [ph.], who was a student that I knew from Randle Highlands [Randle Highlands Elementary School, Washington, D.C.]. I didn't even know he was working up here. And you know, "You go on the air November 6th," da-da-da-da.
Story_ID: 486338
Speaker 1: November 6th, 1971, started 'Spirits Known and Unknown.'
Speaker 2: This is ten a.m. or ten p.m. (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah ten a.m. to, to noon. And what it was, was just Gerald [Gerald Bruce Lee] and I playing some jazz and ripping wire copy off the teletype machines and reading some news for probably the first three weeks or so. And then we decided, you know, this is a lot bigger than you and I, we could turn this into some kind of workshop. We could add a real--legitimate news department. So a lady at the time named Joy Epps, who's now Joy Thomas Moore became our first news director, and what she did was invite black students primarily who were in journalism here to be our news department, and then wh- what we did was also create a workshop where if you wanted to learn how to operate the equipment, you wanted to get your third-class license, if you wanted to learn, learn how to program music, we had a workshop that began earlier than the broadcast and they--this is all volunteer. So now the students that came through that, the best of which got an on-air position. And then our motto in that workshop, which is another quote that I, I wanna say he got from [HistoryMaker] Marion Barry, but our motto was, "Each one teach one." So even after Gerald and I left, even after I left to go to Los Angeles [California], the workshop went on from 1971, I wanna say 'til, I think I wanna say to 1986 when it finally went off the air. I split off and had a separate show in the evenings from ten [o'clock] to midnight called 'Sound Caller in Movement' [ph.], which is really like, you know, 'cause WHUR [WHUR Radio, Washington, D.C.] had started, so WHUR was playing real music at the time and so we had that, but we also had two or three jazz shows at, at American U [American University, Washington, D.C.]. One was by the left--the Left Bank Jazz Society from Baltimore [Maryland]. There was another one called the 'New Thing Rouge Music Show' [ph.] which is Rusty Elsan [ph.] and I had the show Saturday nights called 'Sound Caller in Movement.' So we played, you know, some, some heavy duty jazz, and between those three shows, you know, people started listening to WAMU [WAMU Radio, Washington, D.C.], and they really realized how much the demographics get changed because being a public station you have to go and do your, your, your drives. You know, you're on your drives for, for donations. So we raised a bunch of money during the hours that we were on the air which indicated and it doesn't necessarily mean it was just black people listening either, but that we had listeners, you know, that tuned in specifically for our programming because bluegrass was real hot and they were still, they still had a lot of, you know, European classical music. So I--my music interests really expanded through really understanding the, the, the length and the depth of what African Americans and other cultures, especially the Brazilians have contributed to the world of music. And I mean, I guarantee that's the only reason I'm still here.
Story_ID: 486339
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Did you get any experience with sound engineering at that time?
Speaker 2: Well Cheryl [Cheryl Butler], actually being able to operate the radio station facilities and every now and then we went out and did interviews with people, you know, for the news portion of our show. That was my first real professional audio experience, almost got me killed.
Speaker 1: How so?
Speaker 2: Because one of our--one of our reporters, a gentleman named Ernest Doolin Johnson [ph.], who was our answer to Petey Greene. You know, Petey Greene is portrayed in the movie 'Talk to Me,' was a jailhouse guy that became a, a TV and radio commentator. So at that time in D.C. [Washington, D.C.] everybody had to have a jailhouse guy. So Ernest Johnson had spent some time in Lorton [Lorton Reformatory, Lorton, Virginia] and he was our public affairs guy. So he was, you know, he was our version of Petey Greene. We ended up doing the very last radio interview with D.C. city councilman, Julius Hobson. It--we happened to go to do his interview the same day the Hanafi Muslims took over the District Building [John A. Wilson Building, Washington, D.C.]. We got in and out of there right before the siege. I mean literally, we sat on the front steps afterwards and played back a little of the interview to make sure, you know, we had it on tape and then we drove back up here to the campus [of American University, Washington, D.C.] 'cause of th- in those days WAMU's [WAMU Radio, Washington, D.C.] transmitter and studio was on campus. Now the studio is off campus. And as we drove up into the parking lot people came rushing out of the door. "How did you all get outta there?" Like, "Get outta where?" "The District Building." We're like, "We walked out." La-la-la-da-la-la. You know, so we come in and we're listening to the--to the live report, you know, guns, a guy killed, a guy that I know, Maurice Williams, no relation. A guy that I had worked with at the Library of Congress [Washington, D.C.] who said he wanted to be a reporter on WHUR [WHUR Radio, Washington, D.C.]. I hadn't seen him in years. And but I'd heard him on WHUR. So over the intervening years, this kid did what he said he was gonna do and when I walk into the District Building, he's in the press room, you know, 'cause he's got an interview with the mayor or somebody later on and we hadn't seen each other in at least four or five years maybe more (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And what year is this?
Speaker 2: Let's see, I wanna say this is probably, 'cause I left in '79 [1979]. I'm gonna say like '76 [sic. 1977], but I--I'll get the exact year.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 486340
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What year did you graduate from American University [Washington, D.C.] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) American, I graduated in 1974.
Speaker 1: Then what did you do next? You were still working at WAMU [WAMU Radio, Washington, D.C.], orchestrating things, managing?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I mean as--as a volunteer for the show that we created I was still--I still was kind of like the co-creator of Spirits of un- 'Spirits Known and Unknown' workshop. But, you know, a guy's gotta eat. So in seventy--in '71 [1971] I had started working part time in the Library of Congress [Washington, D.C.]. In '73 [1973] I left the Library of Congress to take a temporary, maybe, maybe you will, maybe you won't summer relief engineer job at Channel 4 [WRC-TV, Washington, D.C.], NBC. So that summer of '73 [1973] I worked the Watergate hearings as an engineer.
Speaker 1: So tell me a memory working Watergate?
Speaker 2: Well first of all I gotta give you the memory of getting the job. Getting the job was another miracle, you know, like the miracle with the Selective Service [Selective Service System]. I had met a young lady who was a student here, who was also interested in working at Channel 4, I think she still does, Jackie Flowers [Jacqueline Flowers]. Jackie Flowers said you better put your application in, this is February, because they're looking for their summer relief people who will start in April. Put the application in, type written, the whole thing, really nice. April, I haven't heard anything. So I see Jackie on campus. "Jackie, you know, are they doing interviews?" "Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, they're interviewing, you haven't heard anything?" I said, "No." You sai- she said, "Call this lady, Easter Winters [ph.]." Now Easter, a black woman, she was the secretary or the assistant to the chief of engineering. So I called her and I said, you know, "My name is Russell Williams [HistoryMaker Russell Williams, II], I don't know what happened to my application," da-da-da-da-da. So she gave me a date when I should come in. Okay, okay, fine. So okay. The day before, see I'm sitting in the Library of Congress in my, my little day job I get a call from Easter. Talk about a good looking out call. She says, "Look, I'm pretty sure by tomorrow, Paul Kir- Kirkham, Paul Kirkham [ph.] will have picked all of his people. Somebody cancelled this afternoon, can you come this afternoon." I was like, ah, 'cause now I'm wearing a dashiki, some jeans and some sandals.  And I'm like oh god, "Yeah I can, but I'm not properly dressed." And she says, "Well," and, you know, being a black woman she understood the dilemma. She said, "Well, I'm sure if you come tomorrow properly dressed there won't be a job. You know, maybe you, you can borrow a white shirt or something." And so I said, you know what, I'll be there. And then what I did, I ran through that building. I tried to--I found like guards, you know, does anybody have a white shirt, even a, even a guard shirt that says Library of Congress and no--but anything would've been better than going in there with a dashiki 'cause it's the most conservative news organization of the three at the time. Nobody can help me. No men's store on Capitol Hill [Washington, D.C.]. I didn't drive that day so I didn't have time to go home, get a shirt. I was screwed. I said okay, well here it goes Lord. I got in a taxi, went up to WRC. I see Easter, Easter sees me. She looks, looks, shakes her head, she looks at me, said okay. She said, "Oh and by the way, your application didn't come down from personnel." So now I had to fill out another application long hand. So imagine this, here comes the head of engineering behind me, he sees this guy with his back to him in a dashiki, filling out an application long hand. And I never got a chance to talk to him specifically about this interview, but I'm saying in his mind, he says oh this is gonna be quick, you know, I'm not gonna take long to get rid of this guy. So I come in the door and I, I go back to my friend Luther Forrest [ph.], right, who walked across the quad with his hand out. So when I came into his office, I'm ready to shake his hand, I'm trying everything I can to magically not have him see this dashiki. I'm telling him, I've got my smile going, I'm looking him in the eye, I'm telling him about all this equipment I work with, how excited I am for the opportunity. I've got a third-class radio and telephone license. I work with FM transmitters, et cetera, et cetera. And he's saying, you know, most of the guys he's interested in have first-class licenses and da-da-da-da-da. "Well, have you had any television experience?" I said, "Well, just at the mediocre TV station we have here we're still working with TK11s [RCA TK11]," you know, da-da-da-da-da. So, he's cordial, we chit chat a couple more minutes. And as we we're about to leave his office, I said, "Oh yeah and by the way, how's that new PCP90 [Norelco PCP90] working out?" Then there's like a screech of brakes, like, you know, he saw a cat on the interstate (laughter). He looks at me, says, "You know about the 90?" I said, "Well I just read a little piece about it in Broadcast magazine." But then I threw my education on him. I said, "But it sounds like it's gonna revolutionize the news gathering business." And then he says, "Would you like to see it?" I said, "You're kidding me, you have one here already?" He says, "We just got it in yesterday." So now he's telling--taking me to see the new mini cam, the mini cam that by today's standards is bigger than a studio camera, but it was portable back then in 1973. And we're standing there looking at it, all proud and he says, "Williams," he said, "when can you start?" I said, "I'll be back at five o'clock." He says, "No about two weeks."
Story_ID: 486352
Speaker 1: So how was your experience at WRC/NBC 4 [WRC-TV, Washington, D.C.]?
Speaker 2: My experience, Cheryl [Cheryl Butler], at Channel 4 in Washington [D.C.] was really my first big break and I've always pointed back to that summer. It was the summer of the Watergate hearings, after I miraculously and it was a miracle got the job. I promised Mr. Kirkham [Paul Kirkham (ph.)] who was the chief engineer that he would never regret giving me that opportunity, never, not for one second. So that meant that I had to be on my A-plus game every day. The policy was if you made two on-air mistakes as a summer relief engineer, just empty out your locker, all right. So, it's not like they made it easy for me. Back in those days, you know, people watching, you know, from this point would probably not remember unless you're, you know, old enough that the television, local television stations would go off the air at night. So they would sign on at maybe six in the morning and so the first assignment they gave me was sign on, which meant I had to be at the station at five a.m. They figure okay, you know, young black kid there's no way he's gonna be there at five a.m. on time. We're not talking about colored people's time, we're talking [U.S.] Naval Observatory time, okay. But they had the wrong guy 'cause I was there at four-thirty. I mean, you know, I would've slept at the station to make sure I was there at five a.m., they weren't gonna get me on that. So--
Speaker 1: Tell me about Watergate?
Speaker 2: The Watergate hearings were another Republican president [President Richard Milhous Nixon] had gotten himself in hot water. What happens, you had two sets of crews essentially. You had a crew that actually worked the hearings down on the Capitol [Capitol Hill, Washington, D.C.]. And then depending on what network you worked for, you would have a Watergate crew in your station. So ABC, NBC, CBS had a crew dedicated to the Watergate broadcast every day. So I was part of the station crew. Our director was a gentleman named Charlie Jones [ph.], who has since passed away. And at the time, we still had commercials on film and a lot of news footage film, so I work in the projection island. And I made myself invaluable to the director probably on the first day because, you know, you would always pop back and forth between the senators on the hearings. So it would be Inouye [Daniel Inouye] or it would be Talmadge [Herman Talmadge] or it would be Senator Ervin [Sam Ervin]. And my job, my big important job for NBC was to rotate the slide drum to put the superimposition, the super name of the senator over top of the picture. So at first I would wait for the director to ask for, you know, "Give me Talmadge," and I'd put Talmadge up. And then after I realized okay that's all he's go--that's all I have to do, well then as soon I saw whoever the senator was, I just flipped the slide drum to that name so the director never had to ask for that--that's one less thing he had to ask for. So unfortunately, even though I wanted to go downtown to the real Watergate hearings, that, that assured me just stuck on, on projection. But as, as the hearings went on, you know, I moved around a little bit. I did a little camera, I did a little videotape. And one day, a few days I did master control on-air audio. I was working on-air audio the day--and just a little other--a little bit mor- a little more background. When the hearings first started, all three--all three networks carried the hearings every day. And then after the major witnesses, then we would rotate, so CBC would broadcast the hearings one day, the next day ABC, the next day NBC so they would continue to make their soap opera money and not lose--everybody not lose their whole daytime schedule. So it just so happened to be an NBC day with yours truly running on-audio when Alexander Butterfield made the announcement that then rekindled everybody's interest in the hearings that they had--oh we have recordings of everything that the president said in the White House [Washington, D.C.] in the Oval Office and the private residence, and even the Executive Office Building [Old Executive Office Building; Eisenhower Executive Office Building, Washington, D.C.]. We were like, ah what. Now all of a sudden the Watergate hearings are big news again. And that almost had me hooked into staying in network television and not pursuing anything beyond that. I would've had everything that I wanted. I was already in D.C., which I considered the center of the new- the center of the known universe and that's largely from working at the Library of Congress [Washington, D.C.]. I would've had a great job. And I had a nice house down on Florida Avenue. I said what else--what else do I need, but I still had this thing bugging me about, well there's movies, you know, but how am I gonna get in the movie business from D.C.? The only thing that made me interested in the movie business again was the movie 'In the Heat of the Night.' Not so much because of Sidney's [Sidney Poitier] great performance, but because [HistoryMaker] Quincy Jones did the score and you know, it ga- I said wait a minute, so there're actually black people working behind the scenes in the industry.  Ah, ah, you know, it--you know, just never dawned on me. So that was kind of nagging me, you know. But I would've been perfectly comfortable in network television 'cause NBC offered me a job a couple of times. But I, I hadn't tried everything that--that I wanted to try in D.C. first.
Story_ID: 486353
Speaker 1: Were there other movies at the time that were really sort of calling you to that industry?
Speaker 2: Cheryl [Cheryl Butler], I can't really remember another film that, you know, made me really think seriously about being in the film industry other than 'In the Heat of the Night.' I mean--I mean and, and if, if there were, I apologize to the filmmakers. I mean there're plenty other films I enjoyed, but something about that film, I mean because not only the quality of the film, the subject matter, the way it was shot, the sound, the music, every- everything about that film really resonates with me. I'll stop and watch that film on television regardless of where I am in the--if, if I'm in the last scene of him in the middle I'll stop and watch, you know, Sidney [Sidney Poitier] and Rod Steiger go at it, you know.
Speaker 1: So you really are interested in the--in the production value of film at this time. I mean you're--it's--it almost sounds like when we had [HistoryMaker] James Ingram talking about his method of composing music, but your appreciation of, you know, the sound and the pictures, and the combination of all that sounds like the magic of composing in a way?
Speaker 2: Well to me, the, the film business or the process of making a--what we know is a feature film, which is of course is changing, but what we know is the process of making a feature film is really kind of our highest peak in the process of storytelling. I mean assuming that it's done right. Because you get to appeal to just about every sense but the sense of smell, you know. So you, you utilize music or not. You definitely utilize people's voices and the performance of people's voices, I think, gets--doesn't get as much credit as it--as it should, because yeah you might remember the shot of such-and-such and such-and-such a movie, but you're really gonna remember the line that So and So delivered it, you know, and from 'The Godfather' you're gonna remember Sidney saying, "They call me Mr. Tibbs" ['In the Heat of the Night']. You know, you're gonna remember. You know, "She's my daughter, she's my sister, she's my daughter," ['Chinatown'] you know. You know, you're gonna remember what people were wearing and you're gonna remember if, if they do it right how the camera just moved up to the actor at this particular moment when they turned and looked and said so. So for me all of this is, is like composing music. And even working on, on a big production when the crew and the director and the actors are all in sync, it is like making music. I mean when you--when you just as an observer, even though I'm part of the shot, I'm not really part of the shot like the dolly grip or the cam- the microphone boom operator or the actor. I'm actually just sitting back, you know, in my old job just writing faders and looking at levels and reading the words and looking at the monitor. But even in rehearsal I can look over and see, you know, grips, you know, adjusting lighting and, and an electrician, you know, moving a light and a camera oper- a camera operator focus pull and make it fine--a really fine adjustment there and the actor kind of checking their mark, but not looking at their feet to see where their mark is, you know. And all this has a flow in real time. Even though, we know, we always think in terms of getting a take one, a take two, a take three. If you nail it on take one, you know, that might be it. That might be what we record to history.
Story_ID: 486354
Speaker 1: How did you make your way from D.C. [Washington, D.C.] to Hollywood [Los Angeles, California]? I know you made a stop at the ABC affiliate here in D.C.--
Speaker 2: That's true.
Speaker 1: Can you quickly describe that, then get us to Hollywood?
Speaker 2: Well what happened is it was really--it was really the unions. At Channel 4 [WRC-TV, Washington, D.C.] the film people at the time were in the IATSE [International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees]. I was in a different union, NABET [National Association of Broadcast Employees and Technicians; National Association of Broadcast Employees and Technicians-Communications Workers of America (NABET-CWA)]. No way I'm crossing that divide. At Channel 7 [WJLA-TV, Washington, D.C.], our ABC affiliate, the film and the engineering people are in NABET. So that took another miracle to get over to Channel 7. I took a nonunion job for a year waiting on an opening, but all the time I'm buttering up the people who are in the film and documentary unit. So they finally create a second crew, they get me as a sound person. We do some work in Italy, we do some other, you know, work locally. But now I'm actually working with the, the tools I will be working with later. I'm working with Nagra, which is the, the reel-to-reel record that was the standard for motion picture audio. We have an editor that's right there in the building who's cutting the footage we just shot so I get immediate feedback on whether I did something right or wrong. And after that job--after video kind of took over the news gathering process, they offered me an opportunity to learn camera or take a hike essentially 'cause they didn't need a documentary crew anymore. So I took the hike. I tried to work, you know, freelance here for a little while. I went back to Channel 4 in '77 [1977]. But in '79 [1979] I've--I decided you know what, I'm gonna--I'm gonna make a break. There was an independent film that came to D.C. that never got released, but it was my first meeting of people who were in the film industry in California. And they said hey, you know, if you ever get out to L.A. [Los Angeles, California] look us up, yada-yada-yada. So I took some names and I, I was working for ABC radio at the time, which is the affiliate uptown WMAL Radio [Washington, D.C.]. I took a ninety-day leave of absence. I took an electronics course, which is the requirement of the union to get a leave of absence, it has to be for educational reasons. It just so happens they were teaching the course on Sunset Boulevard one day a week. So that left me the other six days to kind of try to find work and make contacts. I knew one other person from D.C. who'd gone out there and this gentleman's name was James Featherstone [ph.]. He was a lighting electrician and he had also been in my radio workshop at American U [American University, Washington, D.C.]. So, you know, he would feed me people who were doing sound and other contacts. And after those ninety days, I did kind of at the end of that period make enough money that I said okay I, I think I can do this, so I moved out permanently. I left ABC and moved everything, you know, like they said, they loaded up the truck and moved to Beverly [Beverly Hills, California]. Worked at documentaries and industrial films and you know, some commercials for about the first three or four years.
Story_ID: 486355
Speaker 1: My first feature film as a mixer was the perennial favorite 'Penitentiary II.' (Laughter) That's all we'll say about that. My first, first job was working I think what we would call pickup shots meaning that the major part of the movie's already been filmed, but now you're doing like little inserts that, you know, hopefully once you put those in it would make the story flow a little bit easier. It was with Rudy Ray Moore, disco godfather. And I said okay, it can only get better. You know one thing I liked about working with Rudy Ray Moore, he did like to keep, you know, a black crew. He, he did employ black technicians and he, he and his assistant fixed some of the best chili I had ever had and you hopefully liked it 'cause it was chili every day, every day.
Speaker 2: And what was surprising to you or exciting about this new job?
Speaker 1: The thing, Cheryl [Cheryl Butler], that I found most exciting, which I'll backtrack just a little bit. The local rental house in Washington [D.C.] at the time where you would go and buy your cameras or Nagras, and microphones, they treated me like, like gold as long as I worked for the television stations. But once I became a freelancer, for some reason they were kind of reluctant to show me anything. "Oh well you know, this--got a new (unclear) mic [microphone] here, but you don't need to see that." And you know they treated like, you know, all of a sudden I became a second-class citizen. I said all right. So I had a little, you know, I was kind of not sure how me as a black person was gonna be received going out to Los Angeles [California], 'cause I mean this was like the industry. And I was pleasantly surprised that when I went to some of the big rental houses out in L.A., they were like hey let me show you this kid. Hey you know what, you can hold on to that for three or four days, see if you like it, bring it back. I'm like, what. You know, I'm saying, I mean they were giving me respect coming in the door. I said all right, which is not to say that California doesn't have its own problems, but I thought within the industry, the people I ran into at the time, the company was called Audio Services [ph.], now it's called Location Sound [Location Sound Corporation]. But couldn't have--couldn't have gotten a foot in the door without their help. And I ended up running into the manager from this place back in D.C., which was called Brenner's Seni Sound [ph.] at the time. I ran into him at, at a big convention in L.A. So I--I had just happened that when he saw me I was behind a big movie camera, just playing with it, you know, you know, I wasn't interested in being a cameraman, but it was like one of the few times I was gonna get a chance to play with a camera. And he recognized me. He says, "Aren't you, aren't you--aren't you Williams [HistoryMaker Russell Williams, II], Williams from D.C.?" I said, "Yeah," I said, "I, I moved out here now. I--I live in Los Angeles now." "Oh so you're working out here?" I said, "Yeah, yeah, I'm working out here." "Well how do you like it?" "Oh it's great, it's nice weather," and I said, "While you're out here, you might think about visiting a real rental house."
Speaker 2: With all the cutting-edge equipment?
Speaker 1: Yeah, and plus with the people--the, the people's attitudes wasn't the way his attitude was. In other words, they're not gonna just assume that he can't afford what he's looking at or he doesn't know what he's looking at. You know, I never got that treatment from him when I was working for the network, but all of a sudden as a freelancer, you know, all of a sudden now I, you know, wait I'm the same guy, was in here two weeks ago, just now it's on--I don't get a check that says ABC on it, you know.
Story_ID: 486356
Speaker 1: Take me through some of your TV work, what was the chronology?
Speaker 2: Well, you're talking about in Los Angeles [California]?
Speaker 1: In Los Angeles.
Speaker 2: Well, most of my work in, in Los Angeles was trying to get into feature where I didn't do television until probably--well the first important job I had in television was in 19--we shot in 1984. And it's one of those situations where I had worked with this, this director named Alan Myerson who's--who did a few of the, the police, what is it called, not police story, the comedies, what's the name of the--'Police Academy.' He did a couple of the 'Police Academy' films, but this was later. He was always interested in comedy. I did a, you know, kind of like a pilot for him. A hundred dollars a day flat, no overtime, maybe you got lunch. The last day of the shoot we worked twenty-two hours, still a hundred dollars. But he said like all people tell you out there, "Hey kid, you know, when I get some money I'll call you, you know, on some real money." Well about two years later, he actually did. And it was--
Speaker 1: So what year is this?
Speaker 2: This wa- this is '86 [1986]. This is a show for Michael Nesmith was the host. Michael Nesmith had been one of The Monkees, and he had this comedy variety show that we called--that he called 'Television Parts.' I think they've re- they've packaged it in a DVD under another name. But what it ended up being was really a survey and a showcase for all the now big-name comedians. Jay Leno was on it, Whoopi [HistoryMaker Whoopi Goldberg] was on it, Arsenio [Arsenio Hall] was on it, anybody remember Arsenio. Garry Shandling, Seinfeld [Jerry Seinfeld], Bobcat Goldthwait who's passed away I think [sic.], and a few other big name people. And what they would do, since--at the time all these comedians are still doing standup primarily. So they would take one of their routines and they would turn it into a skit. And then Michael being a musician and a singer he would interweave it with, you know, in a different segment of the show he would put in some of his musical stuff from The Monkees or original material, and you know, some other little variety. But it really was the first time I actually had four--maybe four and a half months of work straight. You know, that's the hardest thing as a freelancer. I mean when you're working on a salary job, you know, you're gonna get your check every week or biweekly and it's gonna go on month after month. Now all of a sudden you're freelancing and maybe you get paid this week, maybe you get paid this month, you know what I'm saying, maybe the check will clear. You got all these added, you know, things to be concerned about in addition to if you're in a field like I was in, you have to provide all of your own equipment as opposed to if you're working for NBC, ABC or some other outfit. They're giving you the gear. You just have to not break it, give it back to them the way you found it. So there're added economic pressures on me, as well as you gotta sell yourself, you gotta get yourself around, get your name around. There's no Internet, there's no paging, there's no cell phones. So you're physically duplicating resumes and taking them to people and handing them out and shaking hands. You know, now you can just email somebody. So a lot of the, the stress was kind of taken off of me by getting a show that went four straight months. 'Cause now you're--when you are getting paid at that pay rate, now you can put a little bit of money away. I actually bought a van, so I had a new equipment vehicle and I got a real nice compliment from Mr. Nesmith one day. We were out near Edwards Air Force Base [California], cold morning, I think it was like the last shoot of that season. And he looked at the van, he says, "Is this new Russell [HistoryMaker Russell Williams, II]?" And I said, "Yeah it's new." He says, "I like a man that reiv- that reinvests in his business." And I mean, not that we didn't say anything to each other during the rest of the season, but that was one of the best compliments he had ever paid me. So I knew I was on the right track.
Story_ID: 486357
Speaker 1: During the '80s [1980s], late '70s [1970s], early '80s [1980s], a lot of, you know, 'Movies of the Week' ['ABC Movie of the Week'] this kind of thing, some people I know you've mentioned at some point, Raquel Welch, were there certain actors you enjoyed working with? Who, who are some of the actors you've worked with along the way?
Speaker 2: Okay. In, in the earlier part of my career, let's say '79 [1979] through the early '80s [1980s] and mid-'80s [1980s], one of the things that kept me from the major money, not only 'Movies of the Week' or feature films, not saying I didn't do any, but the major ones was because I wasn't in the union yet. The West Coast IATSE [International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees]. That took until about eighty--'86 [1986], '87 [1987] actually. Okay, now if there was any place where I would say I encountered discrimination or racism, it would probably be getting into the union. But that was my initial impression. What I was really encountering (laughter) was nepotism. Because you could be white and qualified and not get into the union, and that was the IATSE's major stumbling block, but we can get into that later. That's one of the reasons why the Screen Actors Guild says strike, everybody says ah no. If the IA says strike, everybody's like yeah so what. 'Cause they essentially created the nonunion pool of labor that they have to compete against by keep everybody out all those years.
Speaker 1: So your career really took off then in the mid-'80s [1980s]?
Speaker 2: Right. Once I got into the IA, then I was eligible--in other words, yeah I could--I could tell a production designer or I mean not a production designer--I could tell a production manager or director that I was qualified to do their show, but if their show was a Paramount show [Paramount Pictures Corporation] or 20th Century Fox [Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation], without a union card I couldn't step on the lot. So they couldn't hire me. So it wasn't--it wasn't really necessary to cultivate those kind of relationships until I had the credential. Once I got the credential--actually the first really, really good nonunion show that I worked on, feature wise, kind of led me into the, the, the real world of filmmaking, that was 'Field of Dreams.' That would've been 1988. So I got a chance to work with [HistoryMaker] James Earl Jones, a younger Kevin Costner, one of my mom's [Williams' maternal aunt, Ruth Robinson Harshaw] idols Burt Lancaster. I mean I'm sitting there behind the sound panel, I'm saying that really is Burt Lancaster. You know, who I heard later from a gentleman named Ivan Dixon, you know, Ivan Dixon was the only black guy on 'Hogan's Heroes.' But I had worked with him as a director. He said Burt Lancaster did a lot of things behind the scenes for black people. Never wanted any credit. He ins- he ma- he was one of the people that made--during the '40s [1940s] he made a couple films about, you know, World War II [WWII] experiences, and one of them concerned a black unit. And what they had planned to do was take white actors and do what they call a paint down, you know, just paint them black and put them on camera. He said oh hell no, unh-uh. You know, tho- those kind of things. You know, you would never hear that. So here's Burt with those eyes and that chin, you know, that jaw. Ray Liotta who at the time I couldn't figure out why the--why was he cast as Shoeless Joe [Shoeless Joe Jackson], you know, 'cause looking at him on--just--just standing there in front of the camera it didn't do anything for me. But then when I saw him on screen, and you see those eyes, I'm like oh yeah, okay. You see that intensity, you know, I--it didn't really come across when I was looking at him on person.
Speaker 1: What about Kevin Costner?
Speaker 2: At that point, Kevin was just--he was just--he's a California boy and he was really just a Californian. He was serious about what he did but, you know, he wasn't--he wasn't stiff and you know, stuck up or anything. The other thing I liked about Kevin, especially in the early days is, his parents [Sharon Tedrick Costner and William Costner] were around quite a bit. You know, really salt of the earth folks, really nice, sweet. They, they were excited as he was that he was in the movie business. You know, he was still married to his first wife, Cindy [Cindy Silva]. And, and--and she was, she was rare to me, I mean I don't know how their personal life was, but I don't know many Hollywood wives that would be out there with the kids, working on the set, and especially by the time we got to 'Dancing with Wolves' [sic. 'Dances with Wolves'], we're talking about working a sixteen-hour days out in that dirt in South Dakota. She's out there every day doing costumes and has the kids, and as the wife. You know, and as the mother. I'm like, you can't get that. Most Hollywood wives would be getting their nails done, "How's the shooting going honey? Okay well here's a kiss from the kids."
Story_ID: 486358
Speaker 1: So 'Field of Dreams' huge opportunity?
Speaker 2: Absolutely (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I mean as you're describing, I mean family's on set, all that kind of stuff. But who--which company is producing 'Field of Dreams'?
Speaker 2: 'Field of Dreams' was released by Universal [Universal Pictures]. The Gordon brothers, who their, their big franchise, that's Charles [Charles Gordon] and Larry Gordon [Lawrence Gordon], their big franchise that most people would be aware of was--is the 'Die Hard' series of movies. The first 'Die Hard' actually came out in '88 [1988] while we were in Iowa doing 'Field.' So not only am I meeting bigger producers, but meeting Kevin [Kevin Costner] led me directly to 'Dancing with Wolves' [sic. 'Dances with Wolves'] because Kevin is the kind of guy that hires people that he likes, and he hired everybody--pretty much everybody from 'Dancing' that worked with Kevin on some--one of his other movies, either 'Bull Durham' or 'No Way Out,' you know, et cetera, et cetera.
Speaker 1: So tell--describe for us what you're doing then?
Speaker 2: All right. My responsibility, Cheryl [Cheryl Butler], as a production and sound mixer on a feature, A, I have at least two people working with me who are responsible for the microphones and making sure that the microphones get planted or mounted the way we have to, to get the scene. But what we end up doing is, okay six in the morning, seven in the morning, the actors, the director, the other department heads are assembled. We watch the actors rehearse whatever scene we're gonna start with. So you may see the director say I wanna like, you know, the camera to hinge this way and push in later on in the coverage, we'll do x, y or z. So all the time they're talking about what we're gonna see, my crew and I are figuring out if--A, if there is dialogue and if there is dialogue, spoken word, then how are we gonna mic this person. Are we gonna have the microphone floating over their head, are we gonna hide a mic somewhere or plant a mic is the term. Are we gonna put a mic on their body, which was my least favorite option and one of the things I stayed away from as much as I could. And then after the director and the actors have figured out what they're doing, what the camera movies are, then you go into your lighting phase.
Speaker 1: So describe some of the situations you encountered on 'Field of Dreams.' This is a, a baseball movie?
Speaker 2: Right. 'Field of Dreams,' when you look at the film, you know, it seems like you should have absolutely no sound problems 'cause you're out in the middle of nowhere it seems. You're on a--on a baseball field that's on a farm, but on the adjacent farms you've got livestock. The livestock are making noise all day and all night. You've got a bunch of insects out there which, you know, at nighttime, once we turn those big lights on to light up the baseball field, you've got every insect in the State of Iowa all over you. But, for the most part it's, it's, it's a pretty quiet environment. Now you're in an environment without any city sounds, without planes flying over you, where as normal speech, you might be able to hear normal conversation fifty feet away. We're standing out on a street corner in D.C. [Washington, D.C.] or New York [New York], you can't even hear the person standing right next to you shoulder-to-shoulder. So, we get a little bit more background calmness and you get a little bit better bite, meaning you get more resonance out of the actor's voices. We--you know, we're there to figure out. The other, the other main issue that we have to deal with is how wide the person's image is on the screen and that determines how well you should hear them. In other words, if they're this close (gesture) they should sound like you're this close. If they're that big (gesture) in the screen they shouldn't sound like you're this close (gesture) and vice versa. So the camera perspective is one of the things that's the most important part of our job.
Story_ID: 486359
Speaker 1: So you were saying that Kevin Costner sort of moved his crew from prior sets to 'Dancing with Wolves' [sic. 'Dances with Wolves']?
Speaker 2: That's correct. Kevin is, is, is one of the people that, who is very loyal and loyalty is one of those old qualities that, I don't know if, if it's in high demand in, in the new entertainment industry. The gentleman who directed 'Field of Dreams,' Phil Robinson [Phil Alden Robinson], same thing. The only reason I got on the 'Field of Dreams' is because I worked his very first movie, which is kind of the obscure movie called 'In the Mood.' And he told the Gordon brothers [Charles Gordon and Lawrence Gordon] when they hired him as director, he wanted everybody from his first crew rehired for 'Field of Dreams.' See, that's loyalty. And so that led me into, into 'Dances.' 'Glory' was another situation where I had worked with a gentleman on a little television special, I don't know whether it was for an afternoon special or whom, but it, it starred Rosalind Cash, who is a real sweetheart and I'm really--we really miss her in the acting corps these days, and this gentleman's name was Pieter Jan Brugge was our unit manager. Which means he's the person responsible for the budgets and he hires a lot of the crew people that the, that the director don't--doesn't pick him or herself, and this was probably early '80s [1980s].
Speaker 1: What's this called?
Speaker 2: I--I'm trying to remember. I think it was called 'Overnight Guest' [sic. 'Just an Overnight Guest'], a little half hour show. Don't remember much about it. But, now I haven't heard from Jan Pieter in years and he gets in touch with me, and he calls me, says you know, "Russell [HistoryMaker Russell Williams, II] I want you to send us a resume because I'm doing this Civil War movie that stars Matthew Broderick and I'd like for you to be on the picture if you're interested." And I said, "Well when do you start?" "Well we start in mid-January," and you know, da-da-da-da. I'm okay. So I hang up the phone. I'm, you know, getting ready to, I think--I'm trying to remember whether I wanted to mail the resume or just take it to the office physically or fax it. Those were the options then, no email. And then I said, Georgia, wintertime, Civil War movie, ah. You know, I'm thinking the aggravation factors, mud, you know, if there, there--there's a lot of night work it's gonna be wet and mud in the dark. I'm thinking, hm it's all outside, it's gonna be cold, not D.C. [Washington, D.C.] cold, but it'll be cold enough. You know, when you stand outside for twelve or fourteen hours, I don't care where you are, you--you'll get cold eventually. But then the next day, as, as luck would have it, I--I'm--at the time I'm still trying to keep my East Coast connection. So I get The Washington Post and I get The New York Times in L.A. [Los Angeles, California], 'cause I'm not really happy with the L.A. Times [Los Angeles Times] as a newspaper back then. In The New York Times they had a little article about the Civil War movie starring Matthew Broderick, but they were also getting Morgan Freeman and Denzel Washington, and it was about the 54th Massachusetts [54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry Regiment] and I'm like, oh do you mean that Civil War movie huh (laughter). So I said I'm on it baby. I called him back, I said you know what, I'm going to bring the resume over, forget the mail. And I'd be glad to help out anyway I can, you know. So I didn't know Ed Zwick [Edward Zwick] who was our director. I didn't know Freddie Fields who was our producer, I just knew Jan Pieter. So that's how I got on that show.
Speaker 1: On 'Glory'?
Speaker 2: On 'Glory.'
Story_ID: 486360
Speaker 1: So tell me about some of the experiences, what were your challenges?
Speaker 2: 'Glory,' Cheryl [Cheryl Butler], I would--I would say was probably, at least for me, my memory of it was, was kind of close to what I was saying earlier about how when a crew and cast and everybody works together as one, it's like making music. I mean every day on that show I got up saying thank God, you know, for this opportunity. I mean we all realize what an opportunity this could possibly be. I mean it was on the, the script was, was, was pretty good. I mean I would've been happier if they had taken more time to develop the black players. The--you know, in other--the real sto--
Speaker 1: Quickly, catch us up to speed. We know this is a Civil War movie and many people have seen it, but quickly give us the plot and demonstrate how sound played a part?
Speaker 2: The, the plot really revolves around Matthew Broderick's character, Robert Gould Shaw, who was a real, you know, Boston [Massachusetts] intellectual and he would write letters home to his parents. He had joined up and served in one of the other volunteer units in Massachusetts when it was an all-white war. And then after 1863 when Lincoln [President Abraham Lincoln] decided, you know, through Frederick Douglass and other people, just other abolitionists saying, you know this is a war for freedom, you know, you can't have an all-white military, you know, service. So they formed a few volunteer units, some from Massachusetts, some from South Carolina and other states. So the movie really revolves around Matthew Broderick's letters back to his parents, his insecurity in taking over the unit, but then, you know, developing a rapport and the respect of his men and leading his men into this big charge at Battery Wagner in South Carolina [Fort Wagner, Morris Island, South Carolina], which doesn't exist anymore 'cause it's under water. But it was one of the first true tests of, of the black soldier in the Civil War, even though we had fought and, and represented ourselves very well in the Revolutionary War and other engagements. It seemed like no one remembered that.
Speaker 1: And so Denzel Washington's character [Private Trip] was central.
Speaker 2: Denzel Washington plays a character who is a fugitive slave who kind of doesn't get along with some of the other blacks in the unit, but he just wants to kill white people, you know. But the, the mission begins to become a lot more important to him, to his character, then his initial, you know, wanting to get in and just, just to--just to fight. He sees, you know, begins to take on a whole new path for him, even though in the film his character could've been two or three of the actual real soldiers that real--the real things that we know about the 54th [54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry Regiment] is most of them are writing home as well. So you could've paralleled some of their letters home with the commander's letters home as well.
Story_ID: 486361
Speaker 1: So did you do some of the sound for these key acts- actors, Denzel Washington and Matthew Broderick?
Speaker 2: In, in my role as, as a production mixer on that show, I recorded every line of dialogue in the movie. I--every day--in other words, every day the camera rolls and photographs the actors doing what they do, my crew or somebody like me on any other movie has to do the--has to record what the actors are saying.
Speaker 1: Now there was a lot of rugged terrain in that film. You talked about the mud and the grass and all that kind of stuff, so what kind of challenges did you face?
Speaker 2: Well what you have in, in any kind of outdoor film like a western or a Civil War movie, anything military, you really, not only are you challenged by the terrain, you also have to kind of rethink the equipment that you bring because you've either got to roll over this terrain or it has to be carried over, and you have to also be ready for rain, snow, whatever you may encounter. So, if the actors on camera look a little uncomfortable because of the temperatures they're working in, then you can guarantee us behind the camera (laughter) are probably uncomfortable. But that's all part of, of what we have to do. Again, its long hours, it's a minimum of a twelve hour day. But the one thing that was very well done in 'Glory' is that most of our locations were scouted far enough away from the 20th century, since we're trying to recreate the era of the 19th century. Even the scenes where Matthew Broderick accepts the command of the 54th [54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry Regiment] and comes outside this big house and, and Andre Braugher in his first role, straight out of Juilliard school of drama [The Juilliard School, New York, New York], he comes in, he says he's the first volunteer and Cary Elwes, and then the three of them were standing there at the fence. The art department took the time to take, you know, tons of dirt and put over the pavement in that immediate community in that square because back then there wouldn't have been any pavement. And you do have horse-drawn car- carriages going by in the scene, but you really don't hear them because they're on a dirt road. So that's the art department's attention to detail. The woman who was our costume designer, Francine Tanchuck [Francine Jamison-Tanchuck], actually went to England to get a lot of the women's dresses for some of the scenes, the big parade scene which was supposed to been leaving Boston [Massachusetts] and when the troop arrives in South Carolina you see women in these big dresses, you know, the period. She was the one that--that tipped me on to the fact that when you see the 54th getting their shoes for the first time, that back in those days there was no left or right shoe. It became left or right as you broke it in. Think of the barnacles they had on their feet then. So everybody has to get into a whole mo- different mode to do a period piece, meaning you're, you're shooting in a time period that's not present, either future or past. And past in most cases where sound is more challenging because anything mechanical that we hear now didn't exist in the same way or if at all in, say 1865. So nothing that we would've heard from the city could've actually worked in our soundtrack. I have to be aware of not only getting a dialogue, but also what I'm not hearing. No airplanes, no modern day vehicles, you know, nothing that takes you out of the illusion of being in the 1860s.
Story_ID: 486362
Speaker 1: And so what kind of microphones did you use for most of that film ['Glory']?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, all my favorite microphones for production are made in Germany. The Schoeps [Schalltechnik Dr.-Ing. Schoeps GmbH] is what we call a short shotgun mic, it's about this long (gesture). My long shot shotgun microphones are made by a company called Neumann [Georg Neumann GmbH], which is also a big name in the music industry. If you see shots of--classic shots of Frank Sinatra or Nat Cole [Nat King Cole], or say Dinah Washington and they have this big round microphone in front of them, that's usually a Neumann. That type of microphone wouldn't work on a movie set because it's, it's not really sturdy enough to deal with the exterior elements. But that same brand of microphone in a different format is used for a lot of movie work. So, it's important that you have many microphones and it's important that those microphones be of the same brand so that they have--whatever coloration they have, each mic is gonna sound like the mic before it. So if you have to use six or seven mics to get a scene, the audience shouldn't be able to tell that I switched from your mic to my mic to this mic over here. Because every time I open a mic I potentially add more noise. So every time I open a mic, I have to take the other mic down at--secretly at the same time. So it sounds like one mic is magically everyplace where somebody's talking.
Speaker 1: So that really is musical.
Speaker 2: It is and its timing and it's also the fact that when you're working with really good actors, which I have been fortunate enough to work with good actors, they pretty much, once they--once they get comfortable in the performance that they want--then their timing pretty much stays the same. Sure they can ad lib, sure something may hit them in the middle of a performance, they might do something different, you know, but for the most part, you know, you can kind of count on those levels. You can count or count on that exchange between one actor and the other. So we all have to be moving in sync. You don't wanna be the person at the end of the shot, if the cameraman loved it and the director lived it and the actor loved it, and you say well it was no good for sound. If it is no good for sound, then you want to be the first voice they hear once they say cut. Because after everybody else has fallen in love with it, you don't wanna be the only dissenter.
Story_ID: 486363
Speaker 1: This was a breakout role [Private Trip] for Denzel Washington?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Did you know it as you watched him in action?
Speaker 2: You know, watching Denzel in 'Glory,' I mean the whole--the whole cast for me brought their A game. But watching Denzel, especially in that whipping scene, it wasn't until I saw the dailies, which means we shoot our footage today, it gets processed in the laboratory and then the next day we actually see it on the screen. It wasn't until I saw it the next day that I saw the tear 'cause I was physically too far away from him to actually see the tear while he was doing that scene. But you could feel that defiance. I mean in other words, when he comes to work, he comes to work in character. So he's pretty much whoever he's playing, he's that person all day. The only other time I worked with Denzel was on 'Training Day.' Let me say for the record that the two times Denzel worked with me, he got an Oscar [Academy Award] both times. So can we say bonus money? He got nominated three other times between 'Glory' and 'Training Day.' Just--if you, if you finally get to HistoryMakers Denzel, just let him know (laughter), I'm waiting for my bonus check.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) I'll try (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) But, but yeah when he came to the set as Alonzo [Alonzo Harris], he was the guy. And when you--and when you have an actor that works in character, you as a, as a department head or a crew person have to know how and when to approach them cause you don't want to continually distract them with like, you know I need to move your mic [microphone] over here, I need to do this, I need to do that, you know. You know, because they're all--they're already the person that they're gonna be on camera. So you either have to find out whether they want you to communicate to them through the director because they could be one conduit of information and a lot of time that's the director and if that's the way they want it, that's fine with me. But if they do want input from the department heads, there's a certain time that you can approach them about stuff and a certain time you should back off. In an interview that Denzel had I think for 'America's Black Forum,' he mentioned that the people that he enjoy working with were the people that knew what they were doing and the reason you know they know what they are doing, because they don't bother you. And he says, "Russell's [HistoryMaker Russell Williams, II] like that." He says, "I--for, for a while I was wondering whether there was anything on the tape (laughter), you know, but you know, apparently there was. You know, 'cause he, he would never come over and just bother me about, you know." A, a lot of people that do sound because it is a lot of attention to detail, you know, you, you, you could be nervous all the time, you could be like real jittery and you know, well make sure you don't touch your mic, you know, make sure, you know. But you kind of like, I, I, I kind of let the person do what they naturally wanna do in the scene. Let me find out what their--what their inclination is and then if it's going to kill my recording of the performance, then I'll say well maybe we can work out a compromise here. Because I know you, you wanna do that, but it just so happens I have a microphone hidden under here. You know, so if you're--if you're married to that, then I--I should move the mic and come up with another plan. If you're not married to that, you know, and, and so it really is, it's like being in the United Nations [UN], as well as being a technician.
Story_ID: 486364
Speaker 1: Oscar [Academy Award] night in 1989 was a big night--
Speaker 2: Big night.
Speaker 1: For you, for Denzel [Denzel Washington], for almost everyone on, on that film 'Glory.' Tell me about it (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes. Yes, we, we--out of the five nominations that we received, our cinematographer Freddie Fields got--I'm sorry Freddie Francis, 'cause there are two Freddies on that movie. Freddie Francis received an Oscar which we--well deserved. Denzel and myself, now Denzel I believe as a supporting actor was the first category that was read. And I don't know if they still have this tradition, but generally in the Oscar show, in those eras, the supporting actor or supporting winner from the previous year would wi- would announce the winner for this year. So he's the first person to go up first, first award of the night, 'Glory' gets up, we're like yeah baby, yeah, at least somebody saw the movie. Okay, we were happy about that. Then it's probably twelve or thirteen categories into the show before we get to the sound. And you know, they were also presenting the sound as a remote, so the people who announced the sound award were in Australia. I'm like okay, so they're really like testing the satellite connections and all that. The thing that really made it kind of unforgettable for us on the crew was that our lead mixer, in other words in the sound category for the Academies, it's what they call a shared award. So even though I'm the person on the set that does all the actual location recording, all my work is sent through editorial and then it goes through another group of sound people called post production mixers. So they're the ones that add the music, they're the ones that balance the sound effects, they're the ones that balance the voices from what I've done and if necessary, re-record lines that may have been ruined because of airplanes or just, you know, industrial noise, or just the actor was too low or the sound man was incompetent. Whatever, they have to re-record and then seamlessly lay these lines in so that the audience shouldn't be able to tell the difference between my work and the work that's done later. So there's usually a lead postproduction mixer that does dialogue, there's another mixer who actually modulates the music, and a third mixer who does the sound effects like the car crashes, the doors opening and closing, footsteps. So generally there are four people that walk up on the stage when the sound award is announced. Okay now, all of that to say that on the night we were up for 'Glory,' our lead mixer was also up for the movie 'Black Rain.' He was nominated for two movies and he had a separate crew that worked postproduction for 'Black Rain' and a--and a different production mixer. So now, the way that they read the, the, the winner, they don't say 'Glory' and then read the names. They start reading the names of the people who receive the award. So they say Donald O. Mitchell, so he jumps up and he's on his way to the stage. Meanwhile there's seven people frozen in time because until they read the second name, we don't know for which movie (laughter). That was the longest one second in my entire life. I mean we're like (gesture). And then the next name they read was Gregg Rudloff, and then we said that's us (claps hands) (laughter), and then we jump up and we're going down through the aisle and up to the stage. The other surprise, the other--well because some of the people watching this may have already won Academies and if they haven't they're probably some of the people watching who one day will. So if they're in a category where they have a shared award, then the Academy sends you a letter saying that if there are four of you or three of you, whatever, you all have to decide who's actually gonna speak on the night. They really don't want everybody to say something, 'cause who wants to hear from the sound people. We wanna get the best picture, best actor, et cetera. So, we'd already agreed that Donald Mitchell was gonna speak, 'cause you know what, that was his twelfth nomination. He had never stood up before. So you definitely are gonna speak Donald, you kidding me. So he got up to the mic [microphone], he reads off all his tributes in about fifteen seconds, now they give you thirty. And out of nowhere he looks over his right shoulder at me and you can see it on the tape, and he says jump in there. So I hadn't prepared anything. So but I of course took the opportunity to speak to a billion people. So I come up and I say I'd just like to say thank you and all the, you know, to all the people in their home languages of all the viewers. You know, it's like what am I supposed to say. You know, so I, I got it out, you know, I had the Oscar in my hand which is the important thing, and then you go backstage, you go through this, you know, gauntlet of photographers. And one of the important things that they do right off stage, is they take the number on the badge at the back of the Oscar and then they ask you a question, because you have an option here. At this point, you get the Oscar there's no name on it. So they will ask you, A, do you wanna leave us with the statuette and then pick it up at the Academy office [Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, Beverly Hills, California] in a week or two once we put the badge on with everybody's name (shakes head), or B, do you just wanna hold on to it and then we'll call you when the badges have been sent from Chicago [Illinois] and then you know, you'll lose it for a day or so while we put the badge on and you can call, you can come back and pick it up (nods head). 'Cause who wants to go to an Oscar party with no Oscar, huh (laughter)? I got an Oscar dummy, hey, right here. You know, "Where's my Oscar? Well I, I let them--." No, that, that's not gonna play.
Story_ID: 486365
Speaker 1: So did you get your due respect that night at the parties (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh my dear, it was a wonderful feeling. I mean, you know, my first Emmy [Primetime Emmy Award] was, was another tell-tale situation. That was 1988 for obscure CBS show called 'Terrorist on Trial: The U.S. versus Salim Ajami' ['Terrorist on Trial: The United States vs. Salim Ajami'] which if they broadcasted now, everybody would know what they're talking about. In '88 [1988] they're talking about what terrorists, you know, we don't have terrorists over here. But it was--I took a friend of mine who was an actress, she's a still working actress in--in Los Angeles [California], Tina Lifford. And I said because I, I wasn't married at the time, I wasn't really dating anybody, so I said I'm going to the Emmys, I said I should take somebody who can benefit from this professionally, this is on a network. So I took Tina. So as soon as we sit down at this table of twelve, we're the only two black people at the table and everybody's kind of looking at us like, you know, why are you guys here. You know, no one says this, but it--you know, it's kind of like, you know, maybe we're at the wrong table. Okay, they're in a middle of a category while we're seating. The very next category was my category, you know, and I almost missed it 'cause I'm chit chatting with Tina, and then they said okay, you know, this is outstanding sound for the more- for a TV special or a mini. I said oh that's me. And they read the nominees and they said the winner is 'Terrorist on Trial' (laughter). And so I get up (laughter), I gotta go to the stage. The seat hadn't even got warm. Okay, I get to the stage, there's a woman there holding, you know, all the statuettes. So I get to the stage and she kind of looks at me like, I'm like yeah, I'm Russell Williams [HistoryMaker Russell Williams, II], I'm part of the sound team. 'Cause she's like, you know, okay. So then the other two guys come up and there's only three of us in this particular award night. And then work my way back through the crowd, everybody's giving me like, "Atta boy, atta boy." So I get back to the table, now everybody wants to know everything about me. Ended up being six other Emmys at that table before the night was over, but I was the first one. So now, everybody's saying yeah, way to go, way to go, but when I first sat there we were like, you know, (gesture), you know, it's like the neighbors with 'Bebe's Kids,' you know, didn't wanna be associated with them.
Story_ID: 486366
Speaker 1: So in the 1980s then you got an Emmy, a Primetime Emmy [Primetime Emmy Award] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, yeah.
Speaker 1: And an Oscar [Academy Award]?
Speaker 2: The very next year got an Oscar, very next year I got a second Oscar.
Speaker 1: All right, tell us about that experience?
Speaker 2: The second Oscar I was a little bit more prepared. First of all no one could've told me that, A, I would've got nominated two years in a row, but there's no way I'm getting the Oscar two years in a row. Everybody else said, I mean everybody, "Man you're gonna win two years in a row." I said there's no way. There's absolutely no way.
Speaker 1: So this is 'Dancing with Wolves'?
Speaker 2: 'Dances with Wolves.'
Speaker 1: Nineteen ninety [1990]?
Speaker 2: Yes. So I--and I, and I said that all through nomination time, all the way up to the night before the Oscars. And what happened the night before. The night before there was a group here in D.C. [Washington, D.C.] that used to give a really nice dinner and they called their dinner Friends of the either Black Oscar Nominees or the Emmy Nominees [Friends of the Black Oscar Nominees and Friends of the Black Emmy Nominees], 'cause they would do it twice a year. And so on that evening you would get the best of black Hollywood and the best of the journalistic press, even though the press didn't officially cover the event. And you would get, you know, distinguished speakers and it just so happened, Denzel [Denzel Washington] was our host. So Denzel brings me up. He says, "You know, last year Russell [HistoryMaker Russell Williams, II] and I da-da-da-da and da-da-ding." And so I had these prepared remarks. I get up there and I look out in the audience, I see [HistoryMaker] Maya Angelou sitting in the audience. Now Maya Angelou it's kind of strange that she would be there that night 'cause she actually granted us an interview back when I'm working on this little volunteer show at American U [American University, Washington, D.C.] when--not 'Caged Bird' ['I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings,' Maya Angelou], but 'Gathered Together in My Name' [sic. 'Gather Together in My Name,' Maya Angelou] was released. She gave me an hour interview as if I was like Mike Wallace. Very gracious woman. And what she didn't know until that night, was that that interview, that portion of the interview she talked about how she had to leave what she knew and go to Paris [France] and figure out a way to get into the Bricktop's place [Chez Bricktop] and do all these things she dreamed about. And she said she wished the young people would take those kind of risks today to get what they want. And so right before I'm going to L.A. [Los Angeles, California], I'm playing this, I'm pumping, I used to pump myself up with Maya. I used to pump myself up, I mean we broadcasted, but I was just keep that tape going, I'd go to that section, I'd say yeah, yeah. Yeah I can do this--I can do this. So for her to be there that night, that was the first sign I took as saying okay, maybe. And then Denzel happened to say as I was leaving, he said, "Okay, I'll see you on stage tomorrow night." I'm like, um okay. So that was really the first sign I, I, I really took on myself. So that night, things a little bit different. Okay I've been to this once. The second night you watch the tape, this is how you win an Os- this is how you accept an Oscar. You--I--you--don't--you really don't know whether you're gonna win, but it just so happened that the night of, first of all my, my wife, Renee [Renee Leggett Williams] at the time, she had the aisle seat. So I say, well let's switch, so now I'm on the aisle. Because the guy who was the lead mixer, you know, I'd talked about earlier how you have this kind of confab to figure out who's gonna speak. Well he never came to any of the other preliminary events, he never came to the Academy [Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences] luncheon, he never came to the party that the studio gave us, he never came to any of that stuff. He shows up on Oscar night and he says, you know, "I wanna speak." Now we've already agreed, the other two of us, the other three of us that I was gonna speak 'cause I would be the first African American ever win two Academy Awards in any category. So he's like, "Well you ain't gonna speak, you ain't gonna speak," but he says he wants to speak because it's his birthday. I said, "Well okay, well we'll see what happens." That's all I said, that's how I left it. And then once we got seated I said okay, I'm on the aisle, all right there's no way he's getting to the mic [microphone] before I do, no way, okay. You know, he'd have to shoot me first. And then the other thing that happened, and this is just pure ego here, but it also harkens back to starting in television. So before the categories are read on the air, the cameraman from ABC comes to that section 'cause they have actors of course the first two rows, but everybody else is in different section of the theater. So when it's sound, all the sound people are sitting in the same section. So whoever jumps up will be in the frame. So he's standing right there on the aisle right next to me and he's you know got his list, you know, and he's looking. And so then they read the categories, they play the little clips and then they start reading the names of the winners. So this time we don't have any conflict, our lead mixer only worked on one movie. So as soon as they say Jeffrey Wright, I know--not Jeffrey Wright, but as soon as they say Jeffrey [Jeffrey Perkins], I know it's us. So I stand up, stand in the aisle. But I notice the cameraman is like trying to right focus and get his act together and I don't see a red light on the camera. So I just stand there. The red light goes on then we walk. See you don't wanna--see--and if you look at the footage from the '89 [1989], Donald Mitchell [Donald O. Mitchell] is so excited he pushes the cameraman out of the way to get to the stage. I'm like no, no, no, no, no. (Laughter) You see like a wipe of him of him going by. I said no, no, no, no, no. Just take your time. He walked me all the down to the stage, up on the stage and you'll see Bob Hope in the audience gawking like (gesture) who is that. I get to the--I get to the mic, when we turn around on ABC's air, you look the other way the other guys are still glad handing in the aisle. I'm at the podium guys, I can't not say anything. So I start my little speech, but I do the same, I get my stuff out by the time they join me, I look at Jeff, I say, "Hey, jump in there."  You know, 'cause it was his birthday. But he didn't get to speak first, but he did get to speak.
Story_ID: 486367
Speaker 1: So by 1990, you have two Oscars [Academy Award] and an Emmy [Emmy Award]. Tell me why you're being recognized with so many accolades, what is the genius of your work? You might describe it through 'Dancing with Wolves' [sic. 'Dances with Wolves'] specifically.
Speaker 2: Okay. Well Cheryl [Cheryl Butler], I think that for me winning the second Oscar and if you count the Primetime Emmy [Primetime Emmy Award] then by that point there're three, three major awards in a row. It was--it was kind of like people--if I--if I look at it professionally I could say maybe the people who decide who gets nominated and generally speaking those are always people in your--in your branch of the respective academy. (Background noise) We'll wait for this, probably a UPS [United Parcel Service] truck. It's been almost totally quiet since we've been. Okay, the--to get nominated for either major award usually you're nominated by people in your branch. So these are people that theoretically can hear. So maybe it's the fact that I tried to approach my work as radio, meaning that even if you turn the picture off you should be able to hear everyone's relationship to the other actors, just like the radio dramas. And when you do have the picture on, it should perfectly complement what you see. Could be luck. It's definitely the influence of the Creator. Some of my friends in D.C. [Washington, D.C.] claim that I said that I was gonna win an Oscar when I went to California. I don't remember saying that, but they, they like, "No man, you were talking about winning an Oscar before you left here," you know. So maybe if, you know, if you believe in 'The Secret' [Rhonda Byrne]. I definitely believe in, in visualization, maybe that's part of it. Maybe it's all of it, maybe it's none of it. But, I think what happened to me professionally at that point was like an actor who received major awards. Then all of a sudden I--they started sending me scripts saying we would like your touch on such-and-such a movie. It became necessary for me at that point to get representation, you know, to get an agent. I had never, you know, I had done all my own negotiating, I never really thought, you know, a sound guy with an agent, yeah right. You know, but all of a sudden the business side of show became more important because now, you know, people want to know okay well what, what sort of things come in your package. I mean it's not just how much you make as a mixer and how much your equipment cost, but how do you travel. Do you have any special dietary concerns? Do we need to send tickets home to your family so your family can visit? You know, these are the kind of perks that are--that were common in what we call below the line positions. For your viewers, above the line generally means the writers, directors or producers. Anybody who's helping in the creation of the product right at it's--at its genesis. But once a studio or investor, or whomever funds the movie and says okay you have the green light to start shooting on, you know, January 1 and you have a four-week shooting schedule or a seven-month shooting schedule, everybody they hire from that point on is considered below the line. So your cameraman, your soundman, your costumers, production designers, grips, electrics, craft service, the 125 people on average crew is considered below the line. So the below the line people are not gonna get the kind of perks that the actors get, that the stars get. That's why everybody thinks that it's so glamorous working in show business. You know, they see these big star trailers on the side of the set when they come visit a set or they see the, you know, 'Entertainment Tonight' do their little, you know, "We caught So and So coming out of their trailer on Such and Such movie." It's like, I don't have a trailer. I have a truck that's got my gear in it and if I close the doors maybe we have some heat and maybe we have some air conditioning, you know. But, there still are certain things that you can ask for as a crew person. But what I liked about it was the fact that I was being sought out because certain directors wanted my touch, whatever that was.
Story_ID: 486368
Speaker 1: One of my favorite directors that I work with, you know, later on in my career was Billy Friedkin [William Friedkin] who got famous for 'The Exorcist,' 'The French Connection.' Even as--that's, that's a movie where I would say going back to movies that influenced me early, I wouldn't say that watching 'The French Connection' necessarily wanted me to get--wanted me--influenced me to get into the business, but I recognize that he had a whole different approach to how he did the sound in his movies, much more raw, much more documentary style, much more of the way you would really hear this if you were the person in the movie, the character. You know, there was not a lot of music in the sc- in, in 'The French Connection.' I mean there is, but it's not like these--this big lush score that is for the audience's benefit. I mean the person in the movie doesn't hear that unless it's--unless he or she is at an opera or something, you know. So hi- his, his approach to doing sound on the car chase and when--when Gene Hackman is being shot at by the sniper, you can hear him breathing, hear him running down the street. You know, I was like man this is almost like you were right there. So I do remember that. And when I actually got a chance to work with Billy, I worked with him twice. I worked with him on the remake of '12 Angry Men' for Showtime which was Primetime Emmy [Primetime Emmy Award] number two. And then I worked with him on the Sam Jackson [Samuel L. Jackson] and Kevin Spacey [sic. Tommy Lee Jones] vehicle called 'Rules of Engagement.' When I saw 'Rules of Engagement,' the television show, I said oh they're making the show about Sam's--. No, no, it's a whole different 'Rules of Engagement.' But that film, I mean Billy--to me it was, you know, even though working with Phil [Phil Alden Robinson] was kind of like this, Phil was--is really more of a writer then a director, but god bless him, because the movie that he really is known for is a movie that's become an American classic. You know, Billy, a- ano- another guy with no film school training, you know, came from the documentary world. But, you know, when you sit down and have meeting with Billy, Billy wants to pull the best of what you can bring to the program and put it in the movie. So when we got to the--Morocco for one portion of 'Rules of Engagement' he has me out recording indigenous music from different groups in Morocco because he wants to interweave this with whatever the real score is gonna be. He's got me going around getting, you know, special sounds of, you know, tea kettles or anything else that helps sell you that you are in Morocco. Even though in the movie we're in Yemen. I mean we ju- we were very careful to say, "Okay is this something that you would find in Yemen or is it something that's native to Morocco." "Well you wouldn't find it so much in Yemen." "Okay well we don't wanna hear that. You know, we wanna hear what you would hear in Yemen, in that particular party." When we're in the courthouse in the court martial scene, it's a whole different thing working with somebody like Billy Friedkin. And on '12 Angry Men,' when it's basically (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) This since a little bit later on?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: What year is this?
Speaker 1: This--this is towards the end of my career. This is to--this is like '97 [1997] for 'Rules,' and actually both of them, I think, were in '97 [1997]. But this is one of the first times where a director has asked me to be with the actors while they're just doing the table read, while they're just reading the lines, looking at the script. There is no set. There's no props. Just to get the flow of the dialogue. Just to talk about well, you know, how he wants this part of the scene covered, how he wants that part of the scene covered. So that's what I had always hoped to be, in other words, not looked at as just a technical person who records the sound, but one of the film makers. In other words, they would consult with the cameraman, they would consult with the production designer, but only the good directors who know that a lot of what the audience hears is doing more the work in selling the movie than what they see, because your imagination is engaged. If your imagination is not engaged, then I don't care what we put on the screen, you'll say oh yeah, but you know, it's a movie.
Story_ID: 486369
Speaker 1: So you mentioned the secret in visualization--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Does hearing for you work in a similar way? Do you imagine the sounds before you record them?
Speaker 2: I, I try to and, and this, this is a technique that I've used probably more in working with plays since I've been back at the university [American University, Washington, D.C.], I've gotten back into doing a little theater. But before I left to go to Los Angeles [California], I did work as a sound designer for some plays here and there. Not a lot, but what I try to do is, you have to put yourself in the character's place. And if you don't actually have the props that they would've had that creates the sound that you would hear, you have to go and find either prerecorded sound effects or maybe you have to go get this prop and make the sound yourself. But yeah sound for me, not only does it work as the eyes in the back of my head, but in--in doing sound for so many years it--it's a blessing and a curse because the curse part of it is that I always--my attention is always drawn to what shouldn't be there. You know, for so many years of listening to dialogue it's like okay, wel- a few minutes ago we had a truck pull up in the parking lot. That truck immediately draws me away from what I'm doing because I say okay that could be a potential problem. I hear people in the hallway. I hear, you know, machinery and things like that. That never goes away, even though I haven't worked a movie set in five years, you know. But it's the way the mind and the ears work together. People--I had a gentleman when I was at WMAL Radio [Washington, D.C.] give me the real secret, this is a gentleman that's still with us, his name Ed Walker, he's blind. He's--he was a radio announcer and a television personality on Channel 7 [WJLA-TV, Washington, D.C.]. And, and it was so much like the scene in 'Ray' which I wish I had done, but--bu- I was through by then. Where, where Jamie Foxx's character is explaining why the hard soled shoes and the report off the walls helps him locate where he is in space. Well I had almost that exact same conversation back in the late '70s [1970s] with Ed Walker and it saved my life. I'm on a bicycle one day and I'm looking off to my left. I'm in the street, I'm trying to figure out when I can cut into traffic 'cause way up ahead I see somebody parking and they--they're basically in the bike lane. But way before that is a truck, a big, big five-ton truck that's kind of pulled out and waiting to do the same thing, pull into traffic. But what I'm doing is I'm riding right up into the side of this truck. I'm looking this way, but I'm riding this way, and all of a sudden I noticed that I'm getting real close to something, I just whipped out. You know, because--I, I--all of a sudden I'm--for a while I'm hearing all this in the distance, you know, and all of a sudden now I'm hearing something right next to me, so I'm like what the--and I look back and I see this truck, I'm like man I would've been crushed 'cause I would've hit the side of that truck and probably fall right in front of his front wheel and we wouldn't be doing this interview. And that's Ed Walker telling me about his--as a blind person it's not that they hear better, but it's that they have to pay attention to what they hear more so then the people that have the crutch of sight (laughter), well okay. I never thought of it as a crutch. But you--if you see people nowadays out there with their ear buds on, they're walking through traffic, and they're on bicycles, it's like these ears are the eyes in the back of your head.
Speaker 1: Or driving with cellphones?
Speaker 2: Yeah, you know. So the other thing that I had always wanted to do if I ever directed a movie, this is only common in musicals. Usually in musicals they pick the music first to go with the routines and then they shoot the movie based on the routines. Well I wo- I would think any movie that's gonna have music, even if it's not gonna be something the character would hear, but if you have an idea what the score is gonna sound like beforehand, you should let the actors hear that, get them into character. We should know what the sounds are before, just like they know what they wanna see beforehand, we should know what you hear beforehand. To me that's the way to approach making a film.
Story_ID: 486370
Speaker 1: Can you take me through a couple of those films, 'Dancing with Wolves' [sic. 'Dances with Wolves'], '12 Angry Men,' you described 'Glory'--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --and the tapestry there.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Can you take us through 'Dancing with Wolves,' what--
Speaker 2: 'Dances with Wolves,' Cheryl [Cheryl Butler], was unlike--unlike 'Glory' which was a pleasure to go to work on every day, partly because everybody in Georgia can cook. The locations were scouted really well. The crew blended together real well. On 'Dances' nobody in South Dakota could cook that we found--that I found. Okay, so that made it miserable. We had long hours. The crew and cast got, got along really well. Kevin's [Kevin Costner] working style as a director made it a lot--took a lot longer to shoot every day then it would have if he wo- would stick to the convention. But South Dakota also had its benefits in that--that were, there were no extraneous noises. I mean we were so far out in the--in the--in nowhere--in the middle of nowhere, the center of nowhere that one plane flew over us the whole six months we were on that show and that was a B-1 bomber [Rockwell B-1 Lancer]. No commercial airliners, no private planes, you know, like looking for a nice place to play golf, none of that. So we might as well have been in the 19th century as far as what we heard. A little bit of wind every day, you know, but no real sound problems.
Speaker 1: A sound engineer's paradise?
Speaker 2: Paradise, except for the fact that once you got off from work, I mean the first half of the movie we were in Pierre, South Dakota which is spelled like Pierre, but they call it (pronunciation) Pierre, that's the capital. Not a lot of amenities in Pierre, at least in 1989. The second half of the movie we shot in Rapid City [South Dakota]. Okay now you got real restaurants, you got tablecloths on the tables, you can get magazine. I mean you couldn't even get a New York Times [The New York Times] in Pierre, that's how backwards they were, in my opinion.
Speaker 1: And what were some of the central sounds in that film?
Speaker 2: Well, fo- for the--for 'Dances' it's really the voices, the horses, the big thundering herd of the buffalo, which when tho- when they ran those buffalo past you it wo- it would be very easy for you to get trampled because they didn't make the noise that you hear in the movie, that's all created in postproduction. You almost heard nothing. And you're talking about a--I think we ran five thousand head of buffalo past camera. The other issue that we had in actually making the scene is to drive those buffalo. They used some pickup trucks and they used a helicopter, so most of the sound that I actually recorded of the actual stampede we couldn't use anyway. When we got to the, to the--to the Black Hills, a lot more scenic. You know, you get that wind through the pine trees type sound. The other main sound cue for me was the beauty of the Lakota Sioux language. We had a woman named Doris Leader Charge, who unfortunately has passed away, but if you go back and look at that award night [Academy Awards], she's the one that goes up with our writer, Michael Blake and translates his speech into Lakota Sioux. Well she would get us a pair of headphones every day, at least every day that we had Native Americans on camera just to make sure that they got all the language right, and of course when Kevin's trying to learn the language, you know, she has to make sure he's getting, you know, most of his cues correct.
Story_ID: 486371
Speaker 1: '12 Angry Men' I would say was one of my--even though we only shot--I think we only shot maybe fifteen, sixteen days. And we--it was one of the few projects that we actually shot in continuity, meaning we started at the beginning and shot through the way a play would be done. Most feature films you don't shoot like that all. You shoot on, A, actor's availability, B, location availability. So everything we have to shoot at American U [American University, Washington, D.C.], we'll shoot today regardless of where it falls in the actual story arch, and then we move to our next location. Maybe go to North Carolina, and we shoot everything we need in those locations. That's how it's usually scheduled. But I've got twelve of the best voices I've ever worked with, and there's nothing but respect in the room. I mean starting from juror number one, I got Courtney B. Vance, I've got [HistoryMaker] Ossie Davis, George C. Scott, I've got Dorian Harewood, the then kind of unknown James Gandolfini, Tony Danza, Jack Lemmon, Hume Cronyn, Mykelti Williamson, Edward James Olmos, William Peterson, right. And at the end of every day (laughter), these eleven guys would come out of this stage shaking their head and they would all say, George C. Scott. They would all say, out of all those--out of all that talent in the room, it was about George (laughter). So, at one point I remember Courtney Vance coming out of that room shaking his head like, oh. I said, "What's wrong Courtney?" He said, "Man, did you see George in that last scene?" I said, "Yeah." He said, "He has more tools in his toolbox." That's how Courtney--that's how Courtney phrased it. But that to me was, was a--that was one of my favorite productions because that's a show about twelve guys talking. It's not about what you see on the walls and no big vistas, there's no big, you know, camera. I mean, now don't get me wrong, I love that, I love when the camera booms up over the horses and you see, you know, the Grand Canyon off in the distance. This is twelve guys in a room talking about this one guy's rights, was he guilty, was he not guilty, what does the evidence say. You know what I'm saying. It starts out with eleven to one for guilty and that one hold out changes everybody's vote around to not guilty. In the original, of course, was Henry Fonda. The other difference in Billy's [William Friedkin] version versus the original was that in the original was all twelve white actors. In this one we have a multiethnic cast. Mo- Mykelti Williamson plays the bigot that Ed Begley, Sr. [Ed Begley] played in the original. So here--pretty much the dialogue is exactly the same as the original, except we changed--we had to change the method of ex- execution in New York [New York] and we mentioned some different ballplayers because no one would've known who they were talking about in the '50s [1950s] script. But other than that, it's the same words. So now here's Mykelti Williamson talking about those people. You know, and it, it really just puts everything out on Front Street. But it was all about the, the voices, it was all about--it's one of the few times where an actor came over to me and told me that he wanted me to run the set in his big moment, his big closing monologue, George C. Scott comes over, first he asks me am I gonna put a radio mic [microphone] on him. And I said, "George," I said, "have I felt you up any other time in this production?" He says, "No, no, no you haven't." I said, "Well why would I disturb you for your big moment?" And he would call me Commander and I would call him General in tribute to his Oscar [Academy Award] winning role as Patton [George S. Patton]. I would quote him a line from 'Patton' every day. He would say--I'd say, "What line do you want me to hear--what line do you want me to do from 'Patton'?" He says, "How about when I see Rommel [Erwin Rommel] for the first time." I say, "Oh, okay, yeah I remember that." He says, (Gesture) "Rommel, you incredible bastard I read your book (laughter)." You know, he said, "Pretty good, you have to work on it--work on it," you know. But he came over to me, he asked me, he says, "Are you gonna need anything special from me before this shot, because if anything goes wrong with the sound before I get to my big finish, I want you to call cut." I like, "Okay, well we might have to discuss that with Mr. Friedkin." He says. "No don't worry, I'll tell Billy." I'm like okay. So but I said what I would like is a walk through just so I can see where you're physically gonna be, 'cause we have three mics working to get this. And he gave me a walk through and for camera, not in character, but just to show I'm gonna look this way for this line, I'm gonna look that way, I'm gonna turn around, I'm gonna finish here. He nailed it in one shot. As is his--just like that big monologue in 'Patton,' where he starts the movie, nailed that in one shot I was told. But when Billy came over, he says and, and, "George wants you to call cut." I'm like, "No, no, I'm not gonna call cut. I'll just stick my hand out and give him a thumbs up or down if something goes wrong so you can call cut, I wouldn't even think of calling cut on your set."
Story_ID: 486372
Speaker 1: So you have quite a resume, I mean for that one ['12 Angry Men'] again, another Emmy [Emmy Award]?
Speaker 2: Yes. And the only time I was up for a major award that we didn't get that I thought we should have gotten would have been a Primetime Emmy [Primetime Emmy Award] for part one of 'The Temptations' miniseries. Another musical exp- I mean literally it was music, but again just a really beautiful cast, a beautiful crew. We shot all of that in Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania] mainly because the residential areas of Pittsburgh looked just like Detroit [Michigan] in the '60s [1960s], but you know, the property is still in good shape. So they created Hitsville [Hitsville U.S.A., Detroit, Michigan] almost to a T. I think Suzanne de Passe had shot another Motown-related production in Pittsburgh a few years earlier, so she was familiar with the area. But with the music editor and music supervisor, a gentleman named Dan Carlin [Daniel Allan Carlin], they had you know, re-recorded so many of the songs, I think there was only one song in 'The Temptations' miniseries that's actually The Temptations, which is "My Girl." That's the actual Motown [Motown Records] release we--everything else they reworked in--in post. And in a lot of cases, it's the actors on screen that are doing the singing.
Speaker 1: So was that challenging?
Speaker 2: Yes. It--usually when you're doing any--anything where you have dialogue and music at the same time, the problem is the, the approach as a production mixer is the approach of a recording engineer in music. In other words, once we were introduced to what they call multitrack, you don't wanna have the clarinet on the piano track, you don't wanna have the base leaking into the drum track, you don't wanna have the pianos heard over the woodwinds. So when they get to a studio with real instruments, they want to isolate them so that I mean, yeah, you could hear all--you could hear two or three trumpets in one channel, but you don't wanna hear the woodwinds in the brass channel. So it's a little harder to separate those divergent elements on set. So what ends up happening in most scenes where you see, say for instance it's a standard scene, there's a, you know, people walk into a club. Say for instance--well that's--they don't do any music in that scene though. But a standard scene, people walk into a club, they sit down, somebody's performing on the stage. They have dialogue at the table. Now what happens, is we usually play music for the people in the room so they can dance or get into the feel of it all along the walk so the--until the actors get to where they're gonna say their first line. Then we shut off the speakers on the stage. Then the people who are actually performing have little ear pieces and they still hear the song going in their ear, so they can mime. And they can--if they're playing an instrument they just mime their instrument. So it's still in sync when we add the music later, they're still on the same beat they would've been on, but it gives us clear air to get the dialogue. The extras in the background who are doing all this talking and yeah baby all that, they're miming too (demonstrates). So we're only getting the principal actors. Then after we've gotten them, we'll get the background actors to say hey man, and we'll get--we'll get what we call an omni [ph.], so everybody gets to talk and high side, and jive, and if there's applause involved, we get three or four levels of applause. And they add all that together later, so they put the real music in. They put the background level of the extras, but they can keep the dialogue separate from the extras, separate from the music, separate from the effects, similar to what a music engineer does. Where you get in trouble or what's more challenging if you were a documentarian or you're doing a student film where you don't have control of the location, you don't have control of the people in the restaurant or the club, you know, you--you're at a live event and you can't like shut down the speakers so you can get clean dialogue because everybody else wouldn't be able to hear the music. Then you're married, everything is married at whatever level hits the microphone. And it's hard to get divorced once you get married, especially in sound.
Story_ID: 486373
Speaker 1: I wanna find out how you made the transition from Hollywood [Los Angeles, California] back to D.C. [Washington, D.C.], but you have some other really important projects on your resume throughout the '90s [1990s]. I know you worked on 'Jungle Fever.' Can you give us a list of some of those high points?
Speaker 2: Yeah 'Jungle Fever' actually came as a result of going to one of those dinners that I mentioned for the Friends of the Black Oscar Nominees and I met Spike [Spike Lee] at that particular party. It was a great party, Sidney Poitier was there and all of his elegance and class, and, and, and Spike begged me to do this, this movie. And I was like okay, well working in New York [New York] isn't qui- isn't easy because of different union issue. Ended up working with Spike. I loved working with his crew. I mean the crew that he had at the time great, great, great bunch of people. You know, working with Spike was a little difficult. Spike wasn't the best communicator, director-to-department head I've ever worked with. And a couple times I had to pull Spike over to the side, say look, you know, I need a little bit more specific information to help me make your movie. And you know, it actually boiled down having a discussion with Ernest Dickerson [Ernest R. Dickerson] who was a cinematographer at the time. And, you know, he said, "Hey this is Spike's way of taking control of things, you know. Don't--don't pay him any mind." I said, "Well, it does become problematic, 'cause if I'm supposed to get the sound for him, I need to know what he's got in--in his head." But working in New York, a lot more challenging in that there's always noise. So I would--I would never wanna do a period piece in New York. I mean in--like say for instance he asked me to do 'Malcolm X' and I, I told him I was gonna need at least thirty days of prep, and he said no way. I said okay well then, forget about it. 'Cause part of what I wanted to do is when you see photographs of Malcolm X, you know, in a--as an orator, you see like twenty-five to thirty microphones there on that podium. I wanted to get those mics, you know, I would be working with the production designer, but I'd make sure all those mics you see in those famous shots are there. And then maybe two or three of them are actually working. So that when you hear Malcolm in the movie as an orator, he has a different sound then Malcolm walking through the scenes. You know, we used modern mics to do that the way most movies sound. But when he's, you know, when he's giving the speech for The Ballot or the Bullet, you know you want him to sound like the--the Malcolm you had heard on the records or on the films, on the news reels. You know, and a lot of things like that. I wanted to be part of the location scout, 'cause that again, you're shooting the '40s [1940s], '50s [1950s] and '60s [1960s] in 1990s New York. How you gonna get any quiet, how are you gonna get away from the three airports. You know, I mean you can't get completely away, but you can get far enough away so that at least once we put those different decades in the mix, you still won't be hearing the '90s [1990s] still lingering in the background saying, hey you hear that bus, you hear that motorcycle.
Story_ID: 486374
Speaker 1: How did you decide to make the return to Washington, D.C.?
Speaker 2: Well Cheryl [Cheryl Butler], after being in Los Angeles [California] for twenty-three years a couple things had happened. I had started pursue--started to pursue a few projects in producing features, none of those came to fruition. But, a few music videos, a couple behind the scenes projects and things like that, because I really hadn't expected to spend my entire career doing sound, but that was a door that was open when I came to Los Angeles. I had actually--it was interesting--I had actually applied to AFI [American Film Institute] and in the same pile of mail that I got the rejection slip from AFI for the directing program, I got a big--big tax return. So I said, you know, well there's more than one way to get to Los Angeles. So I'll just go out and be a technician and you know, see if I can move horizontally once I got out there. But the problem is, kind of like my experience at the Watergate hearings, once they know you're good at one thing, then that's what they want you to do. So it took a--it took a while, but my initial intention was to try to make a switch over after the second Oscar [Academy Award]. You know, but my wife [Renee Leggett Williams] was--at the time, was like no, no you shouldn't do that now, because now people wanna--I said yeah but this is, you know, this is not really how I wanna di- I don't wanna die doing sound. I wanna die doing something different. Not necessarily being director, but producing had interested me. The other thing that was happening was a lot of our work, meaning a lot of the work below the line was going to Canada and other countries. The same labor and economic forces that have hit the rest of the United States of textiles, auto industry, steel making, a lot of industries that depended on union labor found their labor force in other countries 'cause it was cheaper. You know, we like to eat, we like to have nice houses, we like to have nice cars, you had to pay us a nice hourly. Well you can find somebody else in another country that will work for pennies on the dollar, and that's what a lot of industries did. It took a little longer for that pressure to hit the entertainment industry, but it finally did. So as I found that even my old loyal friend, Phil Robinson [Phil Alden Robinson], who one of the last films he's directed in--of recent years was 'Sum of All Fears' ['The Sum of All Fears'], with Ben Affleck and Morgan Freeman. He called me and he said we're going to Canada. He said Paramount [Paramount Pictures Corporation] wouldn't even take a meeting to consider taking a sound guy to Canada. So you'll be able to do everything we do in the U.S., which I did. So instead of having six months of work, I ended up with five weeks of work and it wasn't five consecutive weeks at that. So which paycheck do you think I would've rather had? And then, couple that with, you know, my dad, James Harshaw, or who's my [maternal] uncle, but you know, my sociological father was starting to feel a little ill, you know. He was starting to run, he had a bout with prostate cancer while he and my mom, [Russell's maternal aunt, Ruth Robinson Harshaw] were living in South Carolina. Once she passed in '92 [1992] and I think the next year he moved back up to D.C. and he started also to have some problems with diabetes. You know, I didn't wanna be in the same situation I was in when my mom died, I was working on a big Eddie Murphy production ['Boomerang'] and you know, she was getting progressively more ill and I had to basically leave the show to run back to South Carolina just in time, you know, to, to, to hear her last words, you know, basically. And I didn't wanna have that same experience again with my dad. Plus I was--I was kind of getting tired of living in Los Angeles. I mean, Los Angeles is Hollywood, it's Beverly Hills [California], it's all that, but most people think of it as glamour. I think of it as--it's probably three hundred square miles larger than it needs to be. You know, D.C. is only sixty-five square miles, plus it's home. So I said how can I get back to D.C. and I need--I need some work, and it just so happened that the dean of the School of Communication and the lady here, who's--
Speaker 1: At American University [Washington, D.C.]?
Speaker 2: At American, who's in charge of a, of a--what is she in charge of? The word just ble- blew right through my head. She's, she's in charge of development. So the dean of American Univ- the dean of the School of the--the dean of the School of Communication at American and the lady, Ann Monett [ph.] who is in charge of development, came to Los Angeles as they do on a regular basis and talked to their alums about either contributing money or contributing to the curriculum. So they took me out to lunch one day and they asked me, you know, ways I might be interested in, you know, giving back. And I said, "Yeah I could give back, but the question is can I give back on campus." "Yes, so you mean moving back to D.C.?" I said, "Well if it can be arranged, I mean, you know, if you have, you know, an opening like that I'm sure that I can contribute some things to the faculty that--that you don't already have, namely I'm--." And at this point it's still true, five years later, I'm the only person on this faculty that's done Hollywood time. You know, most of our faculty, very distinguished faculty, are really great documentarians, but very few of them have done any--I mean more than a year, very--almost none of them except me. So twenty-three years in large format is a great calling card, plus you know, these little statuettes back there don't hurt.
Speaker 1: What's your title here?
Speaker 2: So I--I'm--I started as what they call an artist in residence, and then just this past fall they changed the category to professor of the practice.
Speaker 1: Very nice.
Speaker 2: So that's--that's the new title.

Speaker 1: And while you were doing all of this work in film, you also had children?
Speaker 2: Yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Gotten married. Can you just give us a quick rundown of the family?
Speaker 2: In 1990, my daughter Myles came along. That's spelled M-Y-L-E-S, Myles Candace Williams [Myles Williams]. And I decided that I wanted to not miss the first six months of her life working on a movie. So that was kind of my introduction to working as a professor because I, I took that six months and taught at UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California] just like one day a week. And I really didn't take any long-term jobs so I was actually home. I learned how to change diapers. I learned how to, you know, take the milk out of the refrigerator, the breast milk, warm it up, put it in a bottle. You know, I did all those things, I really lo- I really loved doing that.
Speaker 1: And she was born in 1990?
Speaker 2: Nineteen ninety [1990]. Then my son Khemet Williams was born in 1994. And you know, Khemet is, is too much like his dad. From, you know, he's--he's got a million questions about everything. Well up until he was three, he almost said nothing. And since he turned three, he hasn't stopped talking and he's thirteen (laughter). But--yeah, they--and they still live in Pasadena, California with their mom [Renee Leggett Williams]. But, they have made several trips to D.C. [Washington, D.C.]. They really like D.C. but Myles really is hung on--hung up on being California. I think Khemet probably would like to live here at some point.
Speaker 1: And your wife's name currently?
Speaker 2: Is Rosalind [Rosalind Brown Williams]. So we call ourselves Rosalind Russell [HistoryMaker Russell Williams, II].
Story_ID: 486376
Speaker 1: As you look back on your life, what are the biggest moments? Give me three big moments, just give me a list (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Wow, three big moments. Well are we talking professionally or we talking--
Speaker 1: Professionally.
Speaker 2: Well professionally, definitely number one I would say the getting the job at WRC/NBC [WRC-TV, Washington, D.C.] with that dashiki on (laughter). I, I still can't believe that. Number two, well let's not talk about actually getting the awards [Academy Awards], it's really the, the contacts that led to that. So number two I would say 'Field of Dreams.' And then after the awards, which were--which are pretty big I would have to say, you know, jobs that I enjoyed the most, I wh- I would have to put them in, it would be kind of an arm wrestle between 'Boomerang,' this is like the most fun on a set, 'Boomerang.' Probably the most rewarding professionally, well outside of the award winners, well actually this was an award winner would be '12 Angry Men.' You know, just cast level. In life experiences, I, I was able to do a lot of traveling through the movie industry which is another perk for me. So not the first time I went to Africa, but the second time which wo- which wo- which would be--which was going to Kenya. A real eye opener. Having kids, definitely life changing in a positive way. I mean, I remember my daughter looking out the window. I had a lo- the last eight years I lived in L.A. [Los Angeles, California] I lived in a loft in downtown. I was trying to make L.A. seem like a real city, you know. And she looked outside the window and she saw the skyscrapers out there. And she said, "Daddy, are those castles?" I was like, "Well--," I said, "well yeah, yeah when you think about that, they could be castles." 'Cause I'm looking at the books that she's reading and anything of that scale in those little kids books is usually a castle, you know, where the king, where the big money is. I said, "Yeah, it's almost the same thing," you know. So even to this day I'll ask Myles [Myles Williams], who is now sixteen, although she'll be seventeen in December. I said, "So have you seen your castles recently?" Oh no, no, you know, she's too busy doing, doing girl stuff now, you know.
Speaker 1: So you said Kenya and kids on the personal?
Speaker 2: Let's see, I tell you, my life has been so rewarding in so many different ways.
Story_ID: 486377
Speaker 1: Well let me put it this way (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: What would you like your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: Well I think more so then any of this stuff that people use as a--as a yardstick like what movies you've done, how many awards you got, how much money you've made. My real legacy for me is, is really goes back to the 'Spirits Known and Unknown' workshop. I was always about--I understand that I did nothing without somebody giving me a hand and pointing me in the right direction and maybe even giving me some specific, you know instruction and that was really my legacy. Not only helping so many minorities get into broadcasting here in D.C. [Washington, D.C.], but even in Hollywood, even though it's more different because you have the union problem, I was always a person to bring new blood in where I could. And if they didn't wanna do sound, if they wanted to do camera or some other, you know, craft. I would try to--first, at first you had to pass the test. You had to prove that you were serious. You know, because working freelance in a high-pressured business like the entertainment industry you don't wanna send some- somebody to somebody because they're interested and they're excited and they have a smile on their face, but it turns out they don't have--they don't have the stuff, they can't cut it, they're slackers. You can't send someone a slacker, you have send somebody who really is like--not quite a fanatic, but just about a fanatic about it. Because the referral is sacred. I say you go talk to Cheryl [Cheryl Butler]. Cheryl will, you know, give you a start. Now if you turn out to be a mistake, now I'm in trouble with Cheryl, Cheryl's in trouble with her boss or if she is the boss, you know, it's like, no, no, no. If I say that you're good enough to take the risk on, then like I told Mr. Kirkham [Paul Kirkham (ph.)] back in NBC, you will not regret giving me this opportunity and that's the ethic that I came from because I realized they didn't have to open the door. The door didn't have to open. You know what I'm saying. I could still be in southeast, you know, delivering The Washington Post every day.
Speaker 1: Very good. Well, Russell Williams [HistoryMaker Russell Williams, II] it's been a pleasure speaking with you today.
Speaker 2: Thank you, my pleasure Cheryl (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You've earned the many honors you've been given.
Speaker 2: I appreciate it. And tho- those won't be the last ones though, I'm still working on best picture (laughter).
