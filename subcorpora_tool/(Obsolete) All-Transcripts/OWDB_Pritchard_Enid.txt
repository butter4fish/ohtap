Pritchard   My name is Enid Goble Pritchard. I was born on a farm northwest of  Chandler, Oklahoma, October 6, 1906. My parents, William Perry Goble and  Martha Anne Matthews Goble were born in Indiana. Their parents migrated to  Kansas when they were young. My father was in the run of the second  opening of Oklahoma in 1891. It was the unassigned lands of the Iowa Sac  and Fox and Pottawatomie and Shawnee tribes. He was a farmer. By working  hard and saving, by 1910 a large, two story, five-bedroom house was built for  their growing family. Nine of the eleven children had been born. The house  was made modern in 1926. Various crops were raised such as cotton, corn,  grain, sorghum and alfalfa. There were some fruit trees and berries. They  always had a large garden. There were some pecan trees on the bottom land.  By the    30s 140 acres were farmed. Cows, hogs, and chickens were raised for  family use. In this time in central Oklahoma horse drawn machinery was still  used. Usually we got up at six a.m. The men folk did the out door chores such  as milking and feeding of the animals while breakfast was being prepared. We  all ate at the same time. There was always work to be done by each one. The  girls helped to chop and pick cotton in season. Some of us learned to milk if  needed, but we did not operate machinery. There was always plenty of indoor  work to be done with washing, ironing, cooking, cleaning, sewing, gathering  food from the garden, and drying or canning. There was a cellar for storage of  food. Hogs were butchered and the meat sugar cured for use. When the dust  bowl days and the Depression years came in the    30s, we were more fortunate  than many. Our parents reminded us that if they had not saved we would have  lost all as so many did. Most of the ones who left Oklahoma for California  were farmers who rented farms, and depended upon cotton for a cash crop.  Those who stayed had to get government assistance such as the WPA. There  had been very little rain for several years. Too much of the land in western  Oklahoma had been plowed up. So with no rain, or very little, we had terrible  dust storms. We could see the dust clouds rolling in from the west. The dust  that came in from around the windows was so fine it could hardly be swept up.  Some put damp sheets up around their windows. We did not, as we had too  many windows.  Feed sacks came in prints as well as plain. Children   s dresses were made from  5  them. I made my husband   s boxer shorts, pillow slips, and tea towels from  what I had. For fun in our community when I was younger, we had weekend  parties. No invitations were sent out, all who wanted to come could. We  played singing, swinging games, such as Skip to My Lou, This Old Maid,  Miller Boy, and others. Each family would bring cake or pickles for  refreshments. Sometimes we had homemade ice cream socials. We had  swimming parties. Sometimes we girls went with the boys on opossum hunts,  but usually caught no opossums. Each year there was a pie or box supper in  the community to raise money for Christmas treat sacks for each person. The  sacks were made of red and green mesh, and were filled with hard candies,  nuts, an apple, and an orange. The school children put on a program.  My first paying job was teaching the first four grades in my home district. In  1932, I had saved money and was attending Oklahoma A M College. I had  invested  600 in a company that went broke, so I lost the money. I had to  borrow  300 from my oldest brother to finish the term. In September of 1932,  I married Guy M. Pritchard. He had worked himself through school in my  brother   s Piggly Wiggly grocery store, but he had no job. His degree was in  arts and science. I took the first school I could get. It was a one-room rural,  all eight grades, for  60 a month. Guy went to a CC Camp in Colorado for  several months. I stayed with my parents. My father, Papa, let me drive his  Model-T Ford four miles to my school for  15 a month, and he furnished the  gas. I paid no board and room. Lucky me.  My youngest sister had her elementary teaching certificate, and was hired by  the local school district to teach for  45 a month. By staying at home she  could do this. She walked three fourths of a mile to school. She and I paid a  neighbor girlfriend who needed work, to come live at our house and help my  mother, Mama, with the housework. Her parents were in bad financial shape.  That  3 bought her clothes. You could buy a nice cotton dress for around  2  or  3. You could also buy a good pair of shoes. I had to save all I could to  pay back the  300 I had borrowed from my brother. Anytime I had  20 or  30  to spare I would send it to him. He did not charge me any interest. It took  over two years to get it paid.  When my husband came home from the CC Camp he reentered A M to take  enough hours to get his B.S. in education. The school board where I was  teaching hired him in my place for  70 a month. Now, it was time for us to set  up housekeeping with about 50-some dollars. We rented a little three-room  house, about a half mile from the schoolhouse, for  10 a month. The house  was sheetrock inside, but did need new paint and paper. The landlord bought  me a quart of white paint, for 90 cents, to paint the wood work, and some  pretty apple green wallpaper with a little white flower on it to paper the  bedroom, for 25 cents a roll. The kitchen floor had linoleum on it. I bought  varnish for the other two room   s floors. The kitchen had no built-in cabinets.  I painted five apple boxes white, stacked them up, and put a white curtain in  front for my kitchen cabinet. For cooking, we bought a two-burner oil stove  with a little one burner removable oven. It was set on top of a three foot by  three-foot furniture crate. The inside of the crate is where the few pots and  6  Lemons  Pritchard  Kite  Pritchard  Kite  Lemons  Pritchard  pans were kept. A curtain was put in front. A little unfinished drop leaf table  and four chairs cost  12. I varnished them. For the bedroom, I had bought a  good used Simmons bedstead for  10. For a dresser, I stood two orange crates  on end and placed a three foot one by twelve piece of lumber across the top. I  placed a dresser scarf over that. A curtain was put in front. An 18-inch  circular mirror was hung on the wall above. I covered a nail keg with some  paisley green material that I had made a bed spread from for a seat. For the  windows, I bought white ruffled curtains. Now the room was finished, and it  looked real pretty. After having grown up in a big house, this little three-room  house was like a playhouse.  We eventually bought a cow, a pig, and some chickens. Later we bought a  two-acre place with a nice little house and a peach orchard for  500. We lived  in this community for six years. I promised myself during those years that I  would never complain as long as I had plenty to eat, plenty to wear, and a nice  warm bed to sleep in. We had been so much more fortunate than others. We  did have a job. As for political views, I felt like president FDR  Franklin D.  Roosevelt  saved the country. One big lesson learned was to save if possible  for the future, and at the same time be generous in helping those in need. Now  it was time, in 1942, to move on. Times did get better.  After eight years of not teaching, I started back. We moved to Stillwater in  1951. After my 31 years of teaching, the last 17 were at Will Rogers   s second  grade here in Stillwater. Guy was hired in 1951 at OSU  Oklahoma State  University  as assistant audio-visual director, and retired in 1972, as director. I  had retired in 1968. At this time I am living in a nice retirement home called  Christian Villa.  The end.  There was a time or two I kind of     You made it through just fine.  But all in all I went through straight.  Do you have any questions?  I just wanted to say I think it   s really clever that you used the apple crates in  the kitchen. What a good idea.  You know, it was real cute. You just can   t believe. Well, in the kitchen the  apple crates, the apple boxes   stores don   t get things like they used to.  Everything comes in cardboard, but we used to get real nice apple boxes. I  kept those apple boxes. I still had two or three of them over in my garage  down here six blocks south, before I moved up here. I just couldn   t give those  apple boxes away. I used them for storage out in the garage. Then the orange  crates were divided. They were bigger than apple boxes.  Describes sizes of  apple and orange crates  So when I set those  orange boxes  on end for my  7  Kite  Pritchard  Kite  Pritchard  dresser, you see, I had those two little shelves in there, and with that piece of  lumber, that one by twelve, across the top, and then the dresser scarf. People  don   t use dresser scarves anymore, but everybody had dresser scarves in those  days. You put a dresser scarf on top. And then with that 18-inch mirror  above, and as I said I got that nail keg and covered it with that same paisley  green material that I had made a bed spread with, and then those little white  ruffle curtains that you see still today, those little white ruffle curtains, it really  made it presentable. The bedrooms had varnished floor. I suppose you used a  throw rug. But really it was kind of cute. Like I said, for me I had grown up  in that great big old house, and that was just kind of like playing house for me.  You had to be creative. You kind of had to know how to make things out of  what you had.  Oh yeah, but we didn   t have any money. People in those days, they didn   t  have so much built-in cabinets. Everybody bought stand up cabinets. Well we  didn   t have enough money to buy cabinets, so that   s just the way I made my  cabinets. Of course, we didn   t have a lot in the way of cooking utensils, and  furniture comes now in cardboard crates too, and it used to come in wooden  crates. That wooden crate, about a three-foot square wood crate, stood up  about three feet high and my little old oven sat on top of that. Then, down  underneath, that made my kitchen cabinets. I probably had a skillet or a pot or  pan or two.  During the 1930s though, I do remember we bought   they were selling this  Wearever aluminum    Wearever     the name printed on the bottom of the pan ,  you   ve heard of Wearever aluminum, and there was a salesman going around  the country selling aluminum. For  36   now it   d cost a  150 or  200 if you  bought anything like that   it had two big pans, a two-quart cooking pan, and a  one-quart cooking pan, and then I bought a ricer. You know what a ricer is?  A funnel shaped thing with a little hole, and you put fruits in like plums or  something and get your pulp out to make your jelly and stuff. I got all that for   36. I   ll show you, I still have one little piece I couldn   t give away. A long  time ago they got this thing that aluminum wasn   t good to cook in, and they  came out with other pots, the steel and stuff, but that ricer stayed good. I  couldn   t give it away. But when I came over here, I gave all my good things I  had to my nieces and great nieces. All my furniture and everything like that.  My niece here in Stillwater did take the ricer because sometimes people still  like to run potatoes or something through it.  My mom still uses that to make her jelly. She has a big wooden thing.  Yeah, that   s what I had. It was a ricer, but it was in that Wearever aluminum.  I   ll show you. I kept one piece as a souvenir, my little quart aluminum pan.  I   ll show you that little pan. You know what? After I moved over here, I  brought my little toaster oven and a waffle iron, and they have a microwave  here, but I had no way of cooking anything on top if I wanted to. So just a few  months ago, I decided I just didn   t like a scrambled egg in a microwave. I  don   t know whether you do or not.  8  Lemons  Pritchard  Lemons  Pritchard  Kite  Pritchard  Kite  Pritchard  Lemons  Kite  Pritchard  Kite  Pritchard  Not really.  And I had given away all my little skillets and everything, so I went down to  Ace Hardware and bought a little one burger electric hot plate and a little iron  skillet so I could make me good scrambled eggs. Now I can use that little pan  I saved if I want to cook something on top of the stove. I   ll show it to you. It  was bought in 1936, and it   s still good.  Just the right size, huh?  Just the right size. I remember our little electric burner and that pan. But I  don   t think there   s anything to it, but aluminum was bad for you to cook in.  I   ve used that since 1936.  Wow, it   s still in great shape.  Sure, it   s still in good shape.  That was a good deal. How much did that pan cost you?  The whole set cost  36. I think we paid it out by the month.  Laughter  But I  just couldn   t give that away. I gave all the rest of it away, and I thought, well  if I ever do need it, and since then I decided to buy that little burner, hot plate  burner   I don   t often use it, but every now and then if I want a good  scrambled egg, that   s what I use. It   s so much better than one made in the  microwave. Microwaves are wonderful for warming up, and I couldn   t do  without them now. At first when microwaves came out, I thought oh I don   t  need a microwave, I have plenty of time to bake potatoes and things like that.  It takes about an hour to bake a potato in a regular oven, and I thought, oh I   m  home all the time, I don   t need this. I about decided I was going to buy one  anyway when my brother died. His wife had already died, and his children all  had a microwave, and so they gave me his. I was in the mood then already,  and now we don   t know how we could get along without a microwave   That   s for sure.  I had a question about some of the games you used to play. I never heard of  Miller Boy before. I heard of Skip to My Lou and other ones but was Miller  Boy?   Singing  Lou, lou, skip to my lou. Lou, lou, skip to my lou.  We   ve heard that one.  Let   s see how does the Miller Boy go?  Singing  There was a Miller boy that  lived by the mill, the mill turned round with the    Well, I   ve almost forgotten  it now, it   s been so long ago. Anyway you change partners and everything.  It   s kind of like Skip to My Lou, you go right and left and around. They   re a  little bit similar to square dancing, but not the same.  singing  Once when the  9  Kite  Pritchard  Kite  Pritchard  Kite  Pritchard  Kite  Pritchard  Kite  Pritchard  Kite  Pritchard  Kite  Pritchard  Kite  Pritchard  Kite  Pritchard  Miller boy lived by the mill, the mill turned around with a really good wheel.  Hand in the hopper and the other in the sack  Kite and Pritchard sing together   ladies step forward and gents fall back.  I know that song.  Then we went right and back.  That   s right we had an old man at the mill.  Singing  Same old man sitting at  the mill, mill turned around of its own free will, one hand on the hopper the  other in the sack, ladies step forward and the gents fall back.  Well we didn   t know that verse, but it   s the same tune, and you   d play it the  same way. See, ladies step forward and gents fall back.  I never knew that was a dance song  I sing that song all the time, that   s a  good song.  Did they dance with it?  I never knew that.  Well, you were in a circle and you sang it, and the boy and the girl was  together. I forget whether the girls were on the inside or the boys on the  inside.  It   d have to be men on the inside because the ladies step forward and the gents  fall back.  All right, I   d step forward and we   d have a different partner then. Then you   d  go right and left around, and then maybe you sing another verse.  Do you know any other verses?  No, just the one I sang, and I   d never heard the one you sang.  I   ve got a ton of them. I know a lot of verses to that song.  You do?   Yep,  Singing  my old man   s in Kalamazoo, you don   t know where, oh yes I  do, first to the left and then to the right, this old mill grinds day and night.  How   d you happen to know them? You grew up in the country, I   ll bet.  Well, some people would think so. A little bit, yeah. I like old songs.  Oh, you just like old songs. Well, how   d you happen to get a hold of that old  Miller boy song?  10  Kite  Pritchard  Kite  Pritchard  Kite  Pritchard  Kite  Pritchard  Kite  Pritchard  Kite  Pritchard  Kite  Pritchard  Kite  Well, we called it    Old Man at the Mill   .  Do you have a book with those songs in?  I have an old recording of an old group doing it. I guess they were from  Tennessee doing it, and I just learned it off that tape that I have.  Well, we didn   t have a lot of verses to it, so whoever taught it to us just taught  us that one thing.  It seemed to fit okay for you guys. Well, that   s neat, I   m glad to hear about  that.  But we played it. We got out in the circle, you see, we did all these things.  You go right and left around, and different ones.  Now I have an interesting question for you. What was the business that failed?  You invested  600 in?  Oh, it was some kind of an ice company here in Stillwater. I forget what they  called it, but my brother had a Piggly Wiggly store here and he thought it was  a good company. I was wanting to get some interest on that money, and then  they went broke. It was some kind of ice company right here in Stillwater, but  I don   t remember what it was called.  Your brother owned the Piggly Wiggly?  Yeah, now Piggly Wiggly stores you bought the franchise, so you owned the  store. You bought the franchise.  That was in the early    30s?  He moved here in 1925, he bought the Piggly Wiggly store. It was downtown,  right in that block where Pier 1 Imports are. He sold out, I think, about 1940  to another man, and then he moved. Grocery stores were moving out from  downtown, and he moved the store up to about where that Good as New  Next  to New  clothes store is on Main. Eventually he sold it to Louis Geyser, and  then it moved up to where the old IGA was on North Main, and then it went  completely out of business. Later IGA went in there. All in the    20s and early     30s, all the grocery stores were downtown. In all towns, that   s the way it was.  Now you don   t find the grocery stores, in towns of any size, downtown. The  grocery stores are out, but in those days, the    20s and    30s, and even before  that, the grocery stores were downtown.  I remember that store on the corner of Sixth and Washington, that IGA there.  It   s still there.  It used to be a Piggly Wiggly.  11  Pritchard  Kite  Pritchard  Kite  Pritchard  Kite  Pritchard  Kite  Pritchard  Kite  Pritchard  Kite  Pritchard  Kite  Pritchard  Kite  Pritchard  Kite  Pritchard  Did it?  Cross my heart. When I first came to Stillwater.  Sixth and Washington, it was a Piggly Wiggly?  Yes it was.  Well, I never did know that.  When I first moved here people would  say  let   s go down to the Piggly  Wiggly. And they   d go down there, and then, of course they weren   t use to it  changing.  Sixth and Washington?  Yeah, you know where that IGA is?  Yeah. I like it.  That   s what all the locals told me, they   d always say let   s go to the Piggly  Wiggly, and head over to that store. When I   d say why was it called that  they   d say because it used to be.  Who are some of your old people that told you that? I never knew that a  Piggly Wiggly was there.  Some of the old faculty members.  My brother   s  Lloyd Goble  Piggly Wiggly store was downtown, and then  Louis Geyser moved it up. Of course, there was a period of time when I  wasn   t in Stillwater much, but I never knew a Piggly Wiggly store was on  Sixth and Washington.  Well, they could have been pulling my leg, but it was a couple of the old  professors.  There were several other grocery stores in there, but I don   t believe a Piggly  Wiggly.  Humpty Dumpty?  Humpty Dumpty might have been there.  I might have been confusing those two.  I think maybe you   re confused. It could have been Humpty Dumpty, it could  have easily been, but Piggly Wiggly moved from, when Louis Geyser bought  it, he moved up to where that Good as New  Next to New  is, and then on up  12  Kite  Pritchard  Kite  Pritchard  Kite  Pritchard  Kite  Pritchard  Lemons  Pritchard  to where IGA on north     I bet it was Humpty Dumpty.  I think that   s more likely because there never was but one Piggly Wiggly store  in Stillwater.  It   s weird how they started nursery rhymes.  Where that place is, used to be Eugene Fields Elementary School.  On that corner there?  We had three schools in Stillwater. They were Jefferson, where the Board of  Education building is on north Main now, Eugene Fields, where the IGA store  is now, and then they had a school where they keep the buses and everything  on the south part of town. They had three schools here, and then in 1951     that   s when we moved here   they had built three new schools, Westwood,  Highland Park, and Will Rogers. They were open for school in February of     51. We went from that rural school to a consolidated school near Cushing,  and stayed there until he went into the service and a then a year or two after he  came back. Then we moved to Kansas, thinking maybe we   d stay there.  Guy  had the opportunity to come to OSU as assistant audio-visual director at  midterm. Well, he took that, and I stayed and finished out the term in Kansas,  and then we moved down here.  Those schools opened in February of    51,  Highland Park, Westwood, and Will Rogers. I started teaching there  Will  Rogers , and stayed there for 17 years, until    68.  So you taught near Chandler.  I taught nine years in Lincoln county. See, I couldn   t put all that in. I had  been teaching several years before I had come up here in    32 to go to school. I  taught my first years in my home district, as I said, but I didn   t put the year. It  was 1925-26. I taught my home school. Then I   d teach two or thee years, and  then I   d come to school.    32 was the year that I had been teaching at a school  for three years, and had saved my money. I had come up to go to school, and  that   s when I lost my money. The Depression had hit, so bad.  So did you always want to be a school teacher?  No, not necessarily. I didn   t know what I wanted to be. I went to high school,  and I started teaching primarily because my home district offered me a school.  I had to take a county examination. I started teaching without going to college.  In those days, in the early twenties, you could take what they called a county  examination, and you could get a one-year teaching certificate. Then if you  wanted to renew it, or if you didn   t want to have to take that examination each  year, you had to go to school and take some hours to renew it. So I taught my  first school in my home district, as my sister later did. I didn   t want to take the  county examination again, so I came up here and went to school. We used to  13  Kite  Pritchard  Kite  Pritchard  Kite  Pritchard  Lemons  Pritchard  have the quarter system. The school I taught, we   d have a summer term, July  and August, and then school was let out for cotton picking until November.  Well, there was a quarter in there that I could come up and go to school. So I  came up and went to school to renew my certificate, instead of taking the  examination. That way I just started teaching and saving money and coming  to school. You could get a life elementary teaching certificate with two years  work, and that   s what I had. That   s what I had when I taught my whole nine  years in Lincoln county, was a two-year elementary teaching certificate.  Then, after World War II, when I went back to teaching, we would come to  summer schools. Guy was working, he worked at a consolidated school over  at Cushing, Hillside   north of Cushing, and he was working in the audio-visual  center  in the summer , so I came over too and took courses, you know,  and went to school and kept teaching. Then, finally got my B.S. in    39. Since  we were living here then, well Guy said,    Well, you just as well go ahead and  get your master   s since you live here.    So I   d go to summer school and got  my master   s in    54. So I   d been in school practically all my life, I felt like. A  lot of the teachers could teach and take night classes or Saturday classes, and  work toward their degrees. I didn   t have enough vitality to do that. I spent all  my vitality teaching during the day, and I was too tired at night to want to go  to school. I spent my Saturdays cleaning house and doing things like that. I  tried taking Saturday classes once, and it just didn   t work for me, so I would  just go to school in the summer time. I just couldn   t do two things at once. I  couldn   t teach school and go to school. It was just too much for me.  It   s better to concentrate on one thing.  I guess that   s it. I just had to do one thing at a time. It just didn   t work for me.  I couldn   t go to school and teach school at the same time.  I thought it was interesting that you were paid  60 a month, and when your  husband took over the same position, he was  70 a month.  Yes, well, salaries were coming up a little, and I guess they thought a man was  worth more than a woman  Laughs . No, men always got a little more on  women.  That was quite a bit more.   10, yeah. I think things had begun coming up a little. I taught at that school  three years before he started teaching it. Teaching all eight grades is a hard  job.  I bet   The first year that I took that, the first school during the Depression, and I took  that, before I had just taught the first four grades. I had not had any arithmetic  or grammar or anything like that since I   d left grade school. They don   t teach  grammar in high school. You take English, but it   s more composition. You  14  Kite  Pritchard  Kite  Pritchard  Lemons  Pritchard  Kite  don   t take grammar, which I think is a bad mistake. I think more grammar  ought to be taught because it   s so hard for most people, and really grammar  was hard for me. Maybe because I hadn   t had very good teachers. When I  took that school, and I knew I had to teach seventh and eighth grade grammar  and seventh and eighth grade arithmetic, and I had had none of it since I was in  the eighth grade myself, I had to study. So I got some books, and I had a  sister-in law who was an excellent English teacher, best I   ve ever known, and I  came up here, she lived in Stillwater, and stayed two weeks. I   d go off to the  bedroom and started through that seventh and eighth grade English book,  grammar book. When I came to something I didn   t understand she   d come in  and explain it to me. As for the arithmetic book, I guess I was a little better at  arithmetic than I was in grammar, and I got that myself. I found out I had to  go back and review percentage from the sixth grade. It was only then that I  realized that percentage and fractions were the same.  So you were learning as you were teaching.  You learn more teaching than you ever do learn going to school. I went  through that arithmetic, and I never went to school a morning when I was  teaching that that I wasn   t sure that I could work every problem that would  come up. If I had come to a problem I couldn   t work, I would have just been a  nervous wreck. Lots of teachers tried that, and they couldn   t teach it. I knew  if I taught arithmetic that I had to know it, and the same way with grammar. I  feel like I could read history and geography, and sort of keep up with that, but  there was an awful lot of reading to do when you   re teaching all eight grades  and have all those books.  I can imagine.  Then you have to combine. You can   t have history everyday. You can   t have  English everyday. You have to rotate them. Some subjects you   d have twice a  week and some three times a week. You just couldn   t have all of them every  day. You just couldn   t possibly get it in. The way I did arithmetic, we did the  blackboard. Teachers don   t use the blackboard much anymore, but I did. Kids  like to use the blackboard. I put the first graders up at the blackboard and give  them little things to do and then would call the second graders up. When it  was too much for the second graders they   d sit down and then the third graders  would come. I nearly always everyday had each class up at the board working  some. In a one-room school, they do learn from each other. I had sixth  graders, sometimes, that were as good as seventh and eighth graders.  How many students did you have?  Well, the first year I taught school an awful bunch, the whole year long I had  58 on roll, which is an awful lot. I changed schools, and had about 30 some,  usually.  That   s still quite a few.  15  Pritchard  Kite  Pritchard  Kite  Pritchard  Kite  Pritchard  Kite  Pritchard  Kite  Pritchard  That   s still quite a few, but you wouldn   t have so many in a grade. Maybe  you   d only have three or four in each grade, but still you had all eight grades.  The student to teacher ratio wasn   t much better then.  No.  If you had 58 on the roll.  Yeah. My first year was my hardest year that I ever had because that is the  first year of all eight grades. That was the hardest year I ever had in my life  because it was the biggest school I   d had. I had more studying to do. That  year when I changed to this other school, I knew it wasn   t such a big school,  but that very year was when that school that had so many, a lot of them pulled  out and went to California, and it turned out that they didn   t have more than  half as much the next year as I   d had.  A lot of people consider 1935 to be the height of the dust storms. You were  here at that time, weren   t you? You   d be 29.  In    35 I was teaching my last year there at that school before Guy took over in     35,    36.  So that would have still been in Lincoln County?  I was in Lincoln County, and I was living at home. Eunice and I both were  living at home. I had to drive from that school just about a mile, a mile and a  quarter, and she walked three-quarters of a mile to school. That girl, our  neighborhood girl, she really grew up in the same class as Eunice, but she  hadn   t been able to go to high school. Her folks couldn   t send her. And so she  was a good intelligent girl. Her people, they owned their farm, and they had  an awful struggle getting through those years. They didn   t have any money to  buy clothes or anything. Her coming down to live at our house, she got her  food, her folks didn   t have to feed her, and with that  3 a week, that went quite  a ways in buying her clothes and shoes and things that she needed. You just  can   t imagine. Things have just changed so fast. I retired here in    68, and my  salary, and we thought we were doing pretty good, but my salary, I kept my  last  pay slip  for showing what your salary was for the year, just to keep, or I  wouldn   t have believed it. I was teaching for  7,000 a year, in    68. Things  have just changed so fast   inflation. I just couldn   t believe.  That does seem like a small amount.  Yeah, but that was in    68. But since that time, inflation has just come up so  fast that you just can   t believe it. Of course, Guy was teaching too, and we  had built. When he came out of the service he was eligible for a GI loan for a  little house. First we built the little house down here on Bennett Drive which  is still there, a little two-bedroom house for  9,000. Then in 1964   and that  was before I retired in 1968   we built a brick three-bedroom house right there  16  Kite  Pritchard  Kite  Pritchard  Kite  Pritchard  Kite  Pritchard  across from Will Rogers school, and at that time, in    64, we paid around   35,000 for that big house. That   s how inflation has come up. I sold it for   120,000.  Is it on the corner?  It   s not on the corner. It   s the one second from the corner, on Graham Avenue.  I didn   t want the corner lot. Our house was built before theirs  the house on  the corner  was, just about the same time. That cost around  36,000, and then  I sold it for  120,000. Can you imagine? See, now that was just how inflation   worked . So you can see where my  7,000 was pretty good, considering what  we bought the house and what sold it for.  Do you know what your husband   s income was at that time?  Well, his was more than mine, considerably. No, I don   t. His was probably  about  9,000 or  10,000 with the university.  And that was considered lower-middle class or middle class or what?  Well, I would say that was good middle class. Now, he didn   t have his  doctorate degree, he just had his master   s degree. When I look back at it and  see how things are today, it   s just gradually come up so fast that you can   t  believe that it was like it was. I just can   t see any young people going and  housekeeping like I did.  Laughter  One of my great-nieces has already just  built a nice, big, new house. That one up there.  Points to picture   That white one?  That house. She married a young man   they went to high school together     that was going to dental school. She continued working until he got through  school. They rented a house at first, and then bought one, and then decided on  this one. By now they have two little boys, and he   s doing well in dental  practice, and they built that nice, big house. I   m sure they plan it to be a  permanent home to raise their children in. Piedmont, which is right out of  Oklahoma City somewhere.  I have another great-niece that is a court reporter, and she   s been married for  several years. They   ve been saving money for a house, but they want to live  out in the country, so they   re building a nice, big house now out in my home  community. Her dad, my nephew, operates a dairy there on our original home  property. He went into the service and when he came back he said he wanted  to raise his family out in the country, but he didn   t want to do like his dad, or  my dad had done, just raise crops. He wanted cash daily. So he put in a dairy,  and he still operates the dairy. His other daughter married a man that   s in  construction work, and they   re building a house right there in that same  community. It isn   t on our land, there wasn   t any spot that her dad still had, but  it   s just about a mile from it. I guess their house is going up real fast now. But  him being in construction work, he   s doing a lot of the work himself, so their  17  Interview  Note  house isn   t going to cost them as much as it would have if he couldn   t do the  work. They   re getting ready to put the roof on it just this week. I hope to see  it, but I want to wait until it   s completely finished. Life is different.  -------  -------  Mrs. Pritchard added more information to her stories on a subsequent visit.
