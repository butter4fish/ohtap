Speaker 2: Now, do I need to tell that (laughter)?
Speaker 1: Well, it's a historical document--
Speaker 2: I know it is, but I don't want it on the website (laughter).
Speaker 1: Well, oh.  We can omit it from the website.
Speaker 2: Okay, that would be fine.  I noticed my friend, [HistoryMaker] Renee Ferguson, didn't have hers on there.  My birthdate is May 30, 1934.

Speaker 1: Before we go into depth, there are five lightweight People magazine-ish type questions that I am compelled by Julieanna [Julieanna Richardson] to ask you, and they only require a short answer.  The first one is do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: I guess I don't. (Laughter) I guess I really don't.  I like a variety of foods, but at the moment I can't think of a one that would be considered my favorite.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: I did at one time, but I guess I should say pink and green.  Those are two colors (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that's for a different reason.
Speaker 1: Yes, I understand.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: I think spring and autumn are my favorites.
Speaker 1: Okay.  A favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Southern California.
Speaker 1: And do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Yes.  You can do anything that you want to do, it takes work.
Story_ID: 351824
Speaker 1: Now, I'm gonna ask about your family history.  I'm gonna ask about your mother's side of the family first, and then your father's [Joseph Wright (ph.)] side of the family.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And, can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us first (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.  My mother's name is Bernyce [Bernyce Hayes Wright], B-E-R-N-Y-C-E, Eleanor, E-L-E-A-N-O-R, Hayes, H-A-Y-E-S, Wright, W-R-I-G-H-T.
Speaker 1: All right. And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: October 29, 1910, and she was born in Stamps, Arkansas.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what do you know about her side of the family?  What about the ancestors on that side?  How far back can you take them?
Speaker 2: I know about them.  Her father was John Henry Hayes [ph.], and he was born April 6, 1858.  He was five years old when slavery ended, and remembered when a man came riding through the fields saying [President] Abraham Lincoln had freed the slaves and he told me about that because he lived to be 101 and he died in 1959.
Speaker 1: Now that's, that's something and a lot of people don't have a direct connection to someone who was alive during slavery and remembers about the end of slavery and has a story about it.
Speaker 2: Has a story about it.  He, having lived so long, was able to share that story with me, and I was accused by the rest of my cousins as being his favorite grandchild, but it was only because I was born in Stamps, Arkansas and all of the other cousins, their parents had moved away from Stamps to various places in the United States, and so they were not around Grandpa Hayes.  Grandpa Hayes' father's name was Payton Grigsby, P-A-Y-T-O-N, G-R-I-G-S-B-Y, and he was a slave in Forest, Mississippi.  I don't know his date of birth and grandpa didn't know it either, but he was a slave on a plantation owned by a Mr. Grigsby in Forest, Mississippi, and he was sold.  He had a wife and children at, on this plantation, on the Grigsby plantation and he was sold to a slave master from Homer, Louisiana, whose last name was Hayes.  His first name I don't know.  And so, he was taken away from that family and relocated to Homer, H-O-M-E-R, Louisiana, and mated with another slave there by the name of Kizzy, K-I-Z-Z-Y.
Speaker 1: Actually the same as the, in the 'Roots' ['Roots: The Saga of an American Family,' Alex Haley] novel (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Same, okay.
Speaker 2: Kizzy.  And that was the mother of my grandfather, John Henry, and there were three other siblings born to that particular union.  Their names escape me at the moment, but my grandfather does not remember his mother, so we don't know if she died or if she was sold to someone else, but he was raised by someone that he called Aunt Norma, N-O-R-M-A.  Well, at the end of slavery, when he became a young man, he left Homer, Louisiana and, as you know, when slavery ended, the newly freed slaves had no place to go so many of them remained on the same plantations where they were and worked as sharecroppers or whatever, but Grandpa Hayes left home in Louisiana and started northward, looking for a better way of life.  He passed through Haynesville, H-A-Y-N-E-S-V-I-L-L-E, Louisiana [Haynesville, Louisiana], where he met my grandmother, who was fifteen.  Grandpa was twenty-four, and she was fifteen, and they married and settled in the Haynesville area in Shongaloo [Louisiana], S-H-O-N-G-A-L-O-O, name for an Indian [Native American] tribe, actually, and somehow [HistoryMaker] Ronne Hartfield and I have common roots.  We discovered that we are relatives somehow; either through marriage or through blood lines, because she is related to that particular area of Shongaloo.  We just discovered that a couple years ago, because we were both on the community advisory council at the symphony [Chicago Symphony Orchestra] and we grew up together.  We were classmates in high school [Wendell Phillips High School; Wendell Phillips Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois], and we found out the, what should I say, the kin--not kinship issue, but the closeness of our families and it was only a little bit later on that we discovered that we might be related.
Story_ID: 351825
Speaker 1: Grandpa [John Hayes (ph.)] met grandma and they married and had thirteen children in Louisiana.  A Mr. Barry [ph.] was residing in the same area and he went to Arkansas looking for another community in which to live.  My grandfather had five sons and the community in which they lived, of course, was all black but my grandpa's heritage was Chickasaw Indian [Native American] and black, and Grandma Hayes was the child of slave master, Ben Sykes [ph.], and a slave, Tina [ph.], and therefore she was biracial and these handsome sons of grandpa, he did not want them to get lynched in Louisiana because of the racial practices there and young women of other races were pursuing them, they were handsome guys, and so he was looking for a place northward in order to move his family to protect his sons and Mr. Barry came back from Stamps, Arkansas, and told grandpa what opportunities there were available, that there was land available for purchase and it was probably that forty acres and a mule thing, but grandpa loaded up his family and they moved northward and it was probably no more than twenty-five or thirty miles, because Stamps, Arkansas is in the southwest corner of Arkansas right at Texas and Louisiana and he moved his family to Stamps, Arkansas, and that's where my mother [Bernyce Hayes Wright], the final child and the fourteenth was born. The previous thirteen were born in Louisiana.
Speaker 2: Now, there's something about Arkansas.  There are so many stories that people have told me about Arkansas.  They're moving to Arkansas from other states, from South Carolina, other places, Georgia, moving, you know, west to Arkansas. I don't, maybe someone watching this later on can connect all the dots, but you're right, you know [HistoryMaker] Ronne Hartfield's family and the Bowmans, I mean, there are, there are a lot of people in Chicago [Illinois], especially, that have roots in Arkansas that have, that speak to some kind of, I don't know, there's a historic, it's was a historic gathering place for people, especially if they were doing some activist type thing or something (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 2: I don't know.
Speaker 1: Well, the further west you went in Arkansas, the less severe, should I say, treatment one received as a result of being black.  The, it was not considered, it was considered more southwest than southern, even though it was north of the, south of the Mason-Dixon Line.  But, it wasn't, the lynchings and the cruel treatment of blacks did not occur in Southwest Arkansas as it did in Mississippi and Alabama and Georgia and perhaps Carolinas.
Speaker 2: Yeah. Yeah. That's interesting.
Speaker 1: And, I think that was the safe haven, more or less, because my mother's family, according to her and according to my grandfather, never had any incidents regarding racial, I shouldn't say, I don't mean racial prejudice, but they never had any incidents, punitive, with, relative to being punitive for being black or stepping out of line or that kind of thing.  When Grandpa came to Arkansas, he purchased thirty-five acres and became what we call a gentleman farmer and during the Depression [Great Depression], he just opened his farm up to the town and anybody who needed food; blacks, whites, whomever, to come and just park, take what they wanted and also he fed most of the town during those severe, very severe times and as his children grew up and married and moved away from home, ultimately my mother was the final one left at home and she met and married my father [Joseph Wright (ph.)].
Story_ID: 351826
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Did she [Wright-Pyror's mother, Bernyce Hayes Wright] talk about growing up, what it was like when she was growing up (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, she did.
Speaker 1: And going to school, and that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  Yes, she did.  Mother attended the Lafayette County Training School/Ellis High School [Lafayette County Training School, Stamps, Arkansas], Lafayette, L-A-F-A-Y-E-T-T-E, County Training School, slash Ellis High, named for George Ellis [ph.], who was the black physician in town, for, to eighth grade.  At that time, the school only went to eighth grade, so she had to go to Hope, Arkansas for high school and she attended Hope high school [Shover Street School, Hope, Arkansas] for one year--
Speaker 1: Hope is a town in (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) H-O-P-E, yeah, where Bill Clinton [President William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton] was born, yes.
Speaker 1: Bill Clinton, yes.
Speaker 2: She attended Hope high school for one year and then she--
Speaker 1: Oh, this is Hope, colored high school?  Or is it, was it--
Speaker 2: No, it was a colored high school.
Speaker 1: Okay. All right.
Speaker 2: It may have been named, I don't think it was named Yeager High School [sic.] at that time, Yeager, but he was the professor.  Later on, it was named after Professor Yeager [Henry Clay Yerger], Y-E-A-G-E-R [sic.].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It's an interesting thing about Bill Clinton too, because my cousins babysat him in Stamps, Arkansas.  (Laughter) He was, his uncle, his mother's sister's husband [sic.], was the sheriff of Stamps, Arkansas of Lafayette County and his name was Wade Tatom [Samuel Wade Tatom], T-A-T-O-M, and Virginia Kelley [Virginia Cassidy Kelley], who was the mother of Bill Clinton, was married to, I'm sorry, her sister was married to Wade Tatom, and my cousin's mother was a domestic in the household and Jo, female Jo Brown [ph.], J-O, used to play and babysit with Bill while her mother was working there, whenever Mrs. Kelley came to town to visit.
Speaker 1: Hm.
Speaker 2: That's kind of the Arkansas stuff (laughter) that goes on.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: In fact, whenever Bill Clinton comes back to Arkansas he visits everybody around the Little Rock [Arkansas] area.  I don't think he makes it back down to Stamps anymore because his aunt and that uncle have now passed away, so I don't think he goes back down there, but he would remember all of that.  He would remember all of that (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) He would, he would.
Speaker 2: He would remember.  He never forgets.
Story_ID: 351827
Speaker 1: (Simulaneous) We had her [Wright-Pryor's mother, Bernyce Hayes Wright] at the Hope colored high school [Shover Street School, Hope, Arkansas].
Speaker 2: Okay, yes.  And then for her sophomore, junior, and senior years, she attended the Arkadelphia Presbyterian Academy, that's A-R-K-A-D-E-L-P-H-I-A Presbyterian Academy in Arkadelphia, Arkansas, and she finished twelfth grade there.  She was a basketball star.
Speaker 1: Now, this is something, I've heard this over and over again and it sort of, it reconstructs the image we have of girls sports in those days, in the early part of the century basketball was a big sport amongst girls, I suppose, especially down south (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes. Yes.
Speaker 1: A lot of people talk about that, basketball.
Speaker 2: Well, actually I think it was, you know, late 1800s that James Naismith invented that game of basketball, and so it was very popular among girls and boys.  I think the rules were different for girls at that time. I think, now they play more according to the general rules of basketball--
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: But, mother played on the team and I think she told me she was a center on the team, but at any rate she completed--
Speaker 1: Was she tall, was she?
Speaker 2: No, she's not (laughter).  Well, when I, since I've known mother (laughter), which would be since my birth, and was aware of anything about height, she was about five [feet] three-and-a-half [inches], and well now, due to arthritis, she's about five feet three inches now, or maybe five two-and-a-half, but when I look at the picture of her on the team, she looks taller so she may have been taller and, due to arthritis and that what-have-you, she's, she's shorter now.  But, she was a basketball star, and those are some of her very favorite memories. In fact, her picture is at, in the archives at Johnson C. Smith University [Charlotte, North Carolina] over on the East Coast, and one of my cousins went there.  She's a member of the presbytery from Detroit [Michigan], and she went to there and then called mother and said, "I didn't know you played basketball in high school" and mother said, "Yes, I did.  How did you know it?"  She said, "I saw your picture on, in the archives at Johnson C. Smith."  And so, that's how extensive (laughter) that connection runs.
Story_ID: 351828
Speaker 1: But, mom [Bernyce Hayes Wright] finished Arkadelphia, graduated in 1930 from the Arkadelphia Presbyterian Academy [Arkadelphia, Arkansas], and then she returned to Stamps [Arkansas].  Her family all played piano.  Her, one of her brothers played for the silent movies in the local movie house there in Stamps, but if they went, they had to sit in the balcony but he, of course, was down front playing the piano (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So he was the regular musician--
Speaker 1: Yes, he was.
Speaker 2: --for all of the performances.
Speaker 1: Um-hm, yes, yes.  And, I indicated as each child married, well the first child, you might want to know, was born in 1888.  That's the oldest, the oldest of the children.  No, that's not correct.  That is not correct.  That was the third child that was born in 1888.  The first one must have been born in 1884 or 1885, so you know, my mother's history runs a long time and, of course, she knew all of her brothers and sisters, being the baby.  They have a long line, lifeline.  Her father [John Hayes (ph.)], I said, was 101 when he passed and she had one brother who was 100, who passed in 1993.  He is the only one who remained in Arkansas.  He moved to Little Rock [Arkansas], and he was drafted into World War I [WWI], actually, and was part of the Meuse-Argonne campaign [Meuse-Argonne Offensive] where he was gassed during World War I, and came home after Armistice Day and was dying of lung disease and died at age 100, and we used to laugh all the time (laughter) and said Uncle Ruben [ph.] has been dying since 1918, and he lived to be 100 (laughter) but he always talked about I was gassed in the Meuse-Argonne campaign in France in World War I (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So he expected to--
Speaker 1: Yes.  And he was on disability with the government all of those years and finally toward the end of his life they reduced his pension to five dollars a month.  I guess they decided, well I guess he's not seriously injured (laughter).  I don't know what happened but, as I said, he passed away in 1993 at age 100, and another brother was 99 when he passed away, and a sister was 99 and one was 96, and various ones of them, a couple of them passed in their twenties and sixties and seventies and eighties, and so my mother is the last remaining one of the Hayes clan.  We had a family reunion last year at, at the Oak Lawn Hilton [Hilton Chicago/Oak Lawn, Oak Lawn, Illinois] and, of course, mother being the patriot, or the matriarch of the family, people came from all over the country.  There must have been about forty-five or fifty of us who were present to renew those roots and acquaintances, and share our family history with the generation that does not know about it.  It's being passed basically as an oral history.  Some of it is written.  The hundred-year-old wrote down quite a bit of it and shared it with me because I'm the regular visitor to Arkansas, having been born there and visiting my paternal grandmother [Roena Brown Miller (ph.)] through the years, and we still have the family home there, so I'm there annually and I guess I'm the repository (laughter) of the history that Uncle Ruben shared with us.
Story_ID: 351829
Speaker 1: Now, can you give us your father's first name and spell it for us (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.  My father's name was Joseph Dudley, D-U-D-L-E-Y, Wright [Joseph Wright (ph.)], W-R-I-G-H-T.
Speaker 1: And what--
Speaker 2: And daddy was born November 27, 1909.
Speaker 1: Where was he born?
Speaker 2: He was born in Buckner, Arkansas, B-U-C-K-N-E-R, which is the adjoin- town that adjoins Stamps [Arkansas].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what do you know about the ancestors on your father's side.  How far back can we trace that?
Speaker 2: I can go back to his mother, whose name was Roena, R-O-E-N-A, Brown Miller [Roena Brown Miller (ph.)]. Well, (laughter) she had three husbands and she outlived all of them, so Roena Brown Wright Coleman Miller.  And she was born July 18, 1892, and my grandfather, my father's father's name was Huey, H-U-E-Y, Wright [Huey Wright], but I don't know, I don't know his birthdate because he died while my father was a very small child but I did know his parents, whose names were Allen [Allen Wright (ph.)] and Nancy Wright [ph.], and they resided in Buckner, Arkansas.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They had two or three additional children besides my grandfather, Huey Wright, but I don't recall their names.  My paternal grandmother was one of about eight children, and I have a list of their names at home, but I don't recall many of them and most of them, I think, had passed away by the time I was born, but I did meet two of her brothers and then some of her nieces and nephews.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, are there any stories passed down from that side of the family about the end of slavery or--
Speaker 2: No, because my grandmother was born in 1892, and, but she was born on Azar, A-Z-A-R plantation.  That's my paternal, Roena, was born on Azar plantation in Buckner, Arkansas, so that said to me that she was residing, her parents were still residing on the plantation from which slavery had ended because she told me that was where she was born and she met Huey Wright in Buckner, Arkansas, and they married and that's where daddy was born.  She only had one child and that was my father, Joseph D. Wright, and they called him J.D. for short.
Story_ID: 351830
Speaker 1: Now, did he [Wright-Pryor's father, Joseph Wright (ph.)] talk about growing up--what do you know about how he grew up and where he went to school and that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: He grew up and went to school in Buckner [Arkansas].  They lived near whatever the school was at that time, but, and my grandmother [Roena Brown Miller (ph.)] was a domestic, his mother was a domestic in households of the whites in the area.  That's the way she earned her living because, as I said, she was widowed when daddy was a small child, and he was left alone much of the time when he didn't go with her to her place of employment and then she married her second husband, Thurman Coleman [ph.], and they were married maybe only three years and he passed away, and the grandfather that I knew was William Miller [ph.].  That was her last husband, and I knew him as an infant because they were married when I was born, and they lived on the next block from [HistoryMaker] Maya Angelou's uncle's store, which is on what's now Magnolia Street.  It was on what was named later Magnolia Street, and when I would visit my grandmother as a child during the summers, we used to run through the yard across the street from us over to the store and Willie would wait on us, Willie Johnson, and Maya, Marguerite, Maya's grandmother, whom we called Mrs. Murphy [Annie Henderson] but her name was Ms. Johnson.  I think she was married to a Murphy, and then she remarried a Johnson, but everybody called her Ms. Murphy, or maybe Murphy was her maiden name. I don't know which, but it was Marguerite Johnson, and there I am saying Marguerite again, but I did not know her.  I just knew her by the name of Marguerite, because she was long gone from Stamps [Arkansas] when I was born.  She, in fact, she was, here I go again getting in trouble, she came to Stamps with her brother, Bailey Junior [Bailey Johnson, Jr.].  My mother [Bernyce Hayes Wright] remembers them.  My mother was a sophomore in high school in 1928, when Marguerite and Bailey came to Stamps.  She remembers they came with tags on them from St. Louis [Missouri], because their, her parents [Vivian Baxter and Baily Johnson, Sr.] had broken up and, but unfortunately that's the year that Marguerite gives us her birth, 1928, and my cousin, who was born in 1922, his name was Garland Lougin [ph.], L-O-U-G-I-N.  He and Marguerite were classmates.
Story_ID: 352074
Speaker 1: We were talking about [HistoryMaker] Maya Angelou's family coming, they were the Johnsons, right?  You said Marguerite Johnson, before (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, Marguerite Johnson and Bailey Johnson [Bailey Johnson, Jr.].  I think he was named after his father [Baily Johnson, Sr.], and my mother [Bernyce Hayes Wright] remembers--she was not in Stamps [Arkansas] at the time--but she remembers the time that they came to Stamps in 1928, and she was a sophomore going into her junior year, probably Arkadelphia Presbyterian Academy [Arkadelphia, Arkansas], and she said that they came from St. Louis [Missouri] and they were both tagged because they were travelling alone, and were picked up and they lived with Mrs. Murphy, Mrs. Johnson [Annie Henderson] at the store, and with Mrs. Johnson's son, Willie [Willie Johnson], and this is the one that Maya talked about who, he had cerebral palsy, actually, and a cleft palate.  I remember him very well, and, but he spoke and he could walk but he walked with a limp and one side of him was, like paralyzed and he worked. He used one hand to do what he had to do, and every year that I would go to visit my [paternal] grandmother [Roena Brown Miller (ph.)], well it wasn't, it was not consecutive years that I would go, but I would for the store and he would always remember me, but, as I said, this was long after Maya had left Stamps, Arkansas, and my mother was friends and colleagues and classmates in the elementary school with Mrs. Flowers' [Beulah Flowers] children, with Mrs. Flowers' sons, Cleon [Cleon Flowers] and Harold [William Harold Flowers] and Curtis [ph.]. And Mrs. Flowers was the teacher that Maya accredited with being such an inspiration in her life while mother was colleagues of those young men and, as I said, they were classmates and this was elementary school. So that kind of speaks to the time that Mrs. Flowers was teaching and the time that Marguerite was going to school.  Now, a cousin I mentioned was in, was her classmate and Garland [Garland Lougin (ph.)] was born in 1922, and he was pictured in the Bill Moyers [Bill D. Moyers] trip to Stamps with Maya Angelou when he did this pictorial history of her back in the '80s [1980s], I think.  It was either the 1970s or--I think it was like the 1970s, after she wrote, after her book came to prominence, 'I Know Why The Caged Bird Sings' [Maya Angelou], and they were walking down the street and Garland was in a wheelchair and they were talking about the days of their being classmates in third grade and that was around 1928 or '9 [1929] or '30 [1930], something like that.
Story_ID: 352075
Speaker 1: There any stories about them [HistoryMaker Maya Angelou's family]--I mean, did anybody recognize this tremendous talent in her at that point, or--I mean--
Speaker 2: No.  She says that she had been assaulted, as I remember, and I'm getting it confused but I think she said she was assaulted before she came to Stamps [Arkansas], raped, or something as a youngster, and did not speak (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, I know she didn't speak for--
Speaker 2: But mom [Bernyce Hayes Wright] said that she never remembers her not being able to speak.  My mother said she does not recall this.  Now, I know that Stephanie Flowers, who was the granddaughter of Miss Beulah Flowers, tried to acquaint herself with Maya when she was in Tucson [Arizona], or in Arizona for a, some kind of speaking engagement that she had and Stephanie happened to be there at the time.  Stephanie is a state legislator in Arkansas now, and an attorney as her father, Harold [William Harold Flowers] was.
Speaker 1: That's Stephanie--
Speaker 2: Stephanie Flowers.
Speaker 1: Flowers, okay.
Speaker 2: Stephanie Flowers-Kirk, hyphen Kirk, K-I-R-K. She's an attorney and she is now a state representative in Arkansas and her father, Harold Flowers, was the son of this Mrs. Flowers that taught Mar- Maya, and Stephanie tried to get to, in fact she did encounter her and she went up and introduced herself and she said, "I'm Mrs. Beulah Flowers' granddaughter," and she said that Maya said, "You couldn't be her granddaughter."  She said, "Yes, I am.  I'm her granddaughter and I wanted to meet you because I read your book and you talked about my grandmother in your book."  And she said, "No, you couldn't be."  And she refused to talk with her, according to Stephanie.  So, that's, that's hearsay (laughter) but Stephanie did tell me that because I had retained her as an attorney for our property in Arkansas and they have to have someone who has passed the Arkansas bar, and that was how we got our roots together.  I went to her because my mom had known her and her father had done legal work for our family before he passed away, and so I went to Stephanie as the logical person and we began to talk about past histories.  She's a young person.  She's probably in her forties by now, and is a par- has a par- is a parent of a high school young lad, and that it was kind of interesting to me that she did not get to talk with her at all and so Stephanie said she just said okay and just walked away.
Speaker 1: Stamps, Arkansas--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: When you were coming along, she had already left town, I guess, by that time?
Speaker 2: She had to have been gone, but if she wasn't, I would not remember her.  According to her book, I think she must have been only in town three or four years before she left.  I think that's what she stated in 'I Know Why The Caged Bird Sings' [Maya Angelou], and if she was in town only three or four years, then four years from '28 [1928] would have been '32 [1932], and that was before I was born, and I have another cousin who was born in 1920.  She resides in Detroit [Michigan], and she is the child of my mother's oldest sister, the very first born of those fourteen children.  She said she was a couple of years older than Maya and they used to play together when they were kids, so she does remember her very vividly.
Speaker 1: Does she remember her not being able to speak?
Speaker 2: No.  She didn't remember that either.  And she lived, this cousin lived in Chicago [Illinois]--no, I'm sorry--in Stamps, until 1938, because she came to Chicago with me and my mother when they were, when we were relocating to Chicago from Arkansas, so 1938 is when my mother left, left Stamps along with this cousin, Johnny Kendrick [ph.], and my grandfather [John Hayes (ph.)] and my father [Joseph Wright (ph.)] had come earlier in the year to live with another sister and her husband and my father came to find gainful employment and then when he found a job he was able to send for mother and we came in September of 1938.

Speaker 1: Let me go back a little bit.  Is there a story about how your parents [Bernyce Hayes Wright and Joseph Wright (ph.)] met?
Speaker 2: I'm not sure.  I think they met because those two communities were so close together and with my paternal grandmother [Roena Brown Miller (ph.)] coming to Stamps [Arkansas] from Buckner [Arkansas] and my mother's father's [John Hayes (ph.)] property being almost to the Buckner town line, it was just normal that they would get to know one another.  But at the time that they met, my father had already been married and had a child, and he has been my very close brother all of these years.  His name is Otis Wright and he resides presently in Hacienda Heights, California, so my father had this child by a previous marriage and then he met my mother years later.  This brother is six to seven years my senior.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so they met because of being in the same, let's say county or township and the fact that black families were very closely related. Individual families met at work, church, you know church was the center of the community (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, you know sometime there's a story even, you know, about how they focused on each other--
Speaker 2: No, I don't know that.  I never did.  I think they just probably saw one another and were attracted to one another and he began to date her, date my mom.
Story_ID: 352077
Speaker 1: Now how would you describe your parents' [Bernyce Hayes Wright and Joseph Wright (ph.)] personalities and who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: I probably take after my mother more so.  My daddy liked to sing, didn't have much of a singing voice, but his mother [Roena Brown Miller (ph.)] did.  She was a contralto when she walked aisles of County Line Baptist Church [Stamps, Arkansas] (laughter) singing as soloist and in the choir.  My mother came from a musical family.  All of her, all of the nine girls played the piano and as each one married and moved away, the next one became the church pianist and the uncle who lived to be 100 played violin, and you know, that happened a lot in that day too.  They just picked up violins and learned how to play them, and--
Speaker 1: Did he play? I know (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) He played fiddle.  We called it fiddle at that time.  He was a fiddler.
Speaker 1: So he played more or less for contemp-, you know, the contemporary music of--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  The general contemporary music that they sang and things that he heard that were probably popular at that day, and that was Uncle Ruben [ph.].
Speaker 1: And the violin in those days, I mean, people listening to this may think of it primarily as a classical instrument, but it is an instrument used for popular music in the country setting--
Speaker 2: It was, and probably--
Speaker 1: And blues and jazz, even, like Stuff Smith, and these other jazz violin players and--
Speaker 2: Certainly.  Probably because the slave master [Ben Sykes (ph.)] that had my, who was the father of my grandmother, mother's moth- maternal grandmother, was Scotch Irish, and they're the fiddling tradition and what have you, and so Uncle Ruben learned to play the fiddle, and, but he played it not, well, I don't know, I guess he played it in Louisiana because he was like the fifth child of these fourteen, and that's how far ahead he was of my mother, having been born in 1893, and mother in 1910, you see the difference in ages, but he was a self-taught fiddler and then he learned it, became interested, I think, in the fiddle because one of my grand- maternal grandmothers' brothers played fiddle as well.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The one for whom he was named.
Speaker 1: Well, there's a lot of music in the family.
Speaker 2: A lot of music in the family.  After we relocated to Chicago [Illinois], I grew up in music and, of course, the black church was the center of music.  It was the center of culture, the center of, really life in Chicago as I was growing up.
Story_ID: 352078
Speaker 1: Now did you, what caused your family to move, I mean, well, it seems like it doesn't, this seems like maybe a dumb question to ask, but we always ask it of everybody but in different circumstances, you don't know who the family is, but why did your family move from Stamps, Arkansas to Chicago [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: For economic opportunity.  I was born, as I indicated, in 1934, and the Depression [Great Depression] of 1929 five years before, my [maternal] grandfather [John Hayes (ph.)] opened his farm and said for everyone to come and get food so that they did not starve.  They had enough food to eat whether they had money or not, and recovering from the Depression, and I guess the election of Franklin Roosevelt [President Franklin Delano Roosevelt] and the New Deal and all these things, my family left, seeking a better way of life, economic opportunity, and opportunity for me as a youngster growing up.
Speaker 1: Now, was there any, did they have any resistance to or did anyone try to block them from leaving?  You hear these stories about where the white men tried to stop them. Okay. All right (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, no they did not.  They did not.  In fact, I don't remember any conflict in Arkansas.  I, well, at age two-and-a-half or three, or however old I was, I guess maybe I was four, leaving Arkansas, I would not know it, but from my mother's [Bernyce Hayes Wright] talking and her, among her sisters and brothers that we youngsters would sit around and listen to about these oral histories and the like, there was not racial conflict in Stamps, Arkansas, because in their words, it wasn't a matter that segregation did not exist, it's just that the blacks who lived there were basically self-sufficient and didn't need to become involved with whites.  There was a time when you went to a store, if you tried something on you had to buy it, and that happened.  That was going on at that time when my mother was growing up and her family was growing up.
Story_ID: 352079
Speaker 1: But, as far as any racial conflicts and lynchings and drownings and killing somebody and throwing them in the pond or Lake June, as it was called, mother [Bernyce Hayes Wright] said there was no such thing.  The only body that she remembers being pulled out of (laughter) Lake June or the pond there in Stamps, Arkansas, was of a black man who was killed by a black man who caught him with his wife, and everybody knew the story, but in the book ['I Know Why The Caged Bird Sings,' Maya Angelou], various bodies were pulled out of the pond, it was all fictionalized, but when Maya [HistoryMaker Maya Angelou] came to town, the Stamps, at the time that Bill Moyers [Bill D. Moyers] did this TV documentary ['Creativity'], the people were very dismayed with her; blacks and whites alike, because they felt she did not picture their town correctly.
Speaker 2: They're directly in opposition to what she's saying--
Speaker 1: Yes, yes.  They are, and they said it did not exist, it did not happen, and I think that's why she never came back.  She was too, Brown's Chapel C.M.E. Church in Stamps was their family church and my cousins on the corner, there are four (laughter) I guess, major churches in Stamps; there were, at that time, and probably still are, and they were the A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal], the C.M.E., and two Baptist Churches.  Brown's Chapel was the C.M.E. church, which was Colored Methodist Episcopal at that time--
Speaker 2: So that was the --
Speaker 1: But they changed it to Christian Methodist Episcopal.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: But initially, it stood for Colored.  And, that was the church of Mrs. Johnson [Annie Henderson], and that's the church that Marguerite went to, and on that visit to Stamps, with Bill Moyers, she attended the church and she told them that she was going to pledge to help them refurbish the church, renovate the church and to bring it up to standard, and she also was going to make a museum out of the family store.  It has since fallen to the ground and the church has not been refurbished.
Speaker 2: Okay, nor has the store been raised?
Speaker 1: No.  The store has collapsed and they carted the lumber away.  It just rotted.  It was never made into a museum.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, you're saying that the people of Stamps are not very happy with her--
Speaker 1: They're not very happy with her.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: No.  And it began initially when the book was published and that was quite a time, maybe several years, two or three years before Bill Moyers did the, you would have access to those historical records.  I don't know how long it was after the book hit the best, made the bestseller list that he did the documentary.  It may have been a year or two years later, but they were not very receptive to her when she came back, because they had read it and, as I indicated, the entire town was just so angry and dismayed with how they had been portrayed, how their town had been portrayed to the world.
Speaker 2: Hm.  Okay.  That's interesting.  Where are the, the men in your family are Masons in Arkansas?
Speaker 1: Not in my family.  I think my, I had one uncle who moved to Long Beach, California.  I think Uncle Jim [ph.] was, became a Mason.
Speaker 2: There seemed to be some connection there with Arkansas and the Masons--
Speaker 1: Well, remember now, at the time that these children were born, between 1884 and 1910, and so many of them had married and moved away to other parts of the country; Detroit, Michigan; Tucson, Arizona; Long Beach, California; Chicago [Illinois], Detroit, I think I said Detroit already, and mother was the last one at home, Minden, Louisiana, where [HistoryMaker] Dorothy Brown is from, incidentally; Minden, Louisiana; Texarkana [Texas], I think Texas, also the family had moved.  The children had all moved to different places and therefore the associations and affiliations they made were mostly after they left Stamps.
Story_ID: 352080
Speaker 1: Do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: I have some very early childhood memories (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yeah, but when is the earliest one, the very earliest one?
Speaker 2: The earliest one was when we were living with my grandmother, my maternal grandmother after she had had a stroke and I must have been like two years old, and I recounted this to my mother [Bernyce Hayes Wright] years later and my mother was amazed that I remembered that, but I remembered, I told her what the house looked like, and where the various rooms were and how I used to go in my grandmother's room and con her out of her fruit and things that I would want that people had brought her because she was ill, and mother said, "I had no idea that you remembered things like that.  You were only two years old then."  But I remembered the house, the big house on the hill, the big white house on the hill sitting down a lane between two big magnolia trees, of course, I've seen the trees because I go back there every year, but to recount the inside of the house, and my mother and father's [Joseph Wright (ph.)] room, and I know in which I slept at that time, just amazed her.  'Cause my mother and father had purchased a house and they were, we were living in another location and then when my mother's mother had a stroke, then we moved back because my mother was the only child left at home and we moved back so mother could care for, for her mother until she died in 1938, and then that was when the family decided to leave home.  Grandpa [John Hayes (ph.)] no longer wanted to stay there after his wife died, and then when, and hence the migration to Chicago [Illinois].
Story_ID: 352081
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Did you have relatives already here in Chicago [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Yes.  There were two, there were three sisters living here, two of them married and one a widow, and they were living in, two of them were living in an apartment building, in the same apartment building, and one was living maybe three or four blocks away, and that's where my [maternal] grandfather [John Hayes (ph.)] and my father came to live with one of the sisters and her husband, while my daddy looked for work, and then sent for me and mother and my cousins--two cousins came on the train--and we all lived in this four room apartment. My aunt and her husband, Johnnie [ph.], and Vernon Anderson [ph.], and my mother and father, Bernyce [Bernyce Hayes Wright] and Joe Wright [Joseph Wright (ph.)], and myself, and my grandfather and the two cousins.  That's eight people.  So, the dining room became a bedroom, the bedroom was a bedroom, the living room was a bedroom, no, the dining room was the center of activity, the living room was mine and daddy's and mother's room, the bedroom was Aunt Johnnie and Uncle Vernon's room, and there was another room that was made--oh, Grandpa slept on a sofa in the dining room, that's how that was--and I don't know where Johnnie and Norman [ph.] slept (laughter), but we were all eight people in this four room apartment at 4916 Saint Lawrence [Avenue], right across from the Willard School [Frances Willard School, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Hm.  Okay.  Now, what were some of the, you said you actually grew up, more or less, on Ida B. Wells [Ida B. Wells Homes, Chicago, Illinois], right?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Of course, the living arrangements at 4916, were temporary until various ones found someplace to go, and my Aunt Florence [ph.], who was a widow and her two daughters, moved to 43rd [Street] and Saint Lawrence.  They found an apartment and my Aunt Rose [ph.] and Charles Berns [ph.] found a place at 37th [Street] and Giles [Avenue], where they could rent the entire house.  This elderly lady wanted to rent her house.  She could no longer keep it up and she just wanted to keep a room for herself and so they moved from 47th [Street] and Saint Lawrence, I mean Champlain [Avenue], to that location.  In the meantime, Chicago Housing Authority had begun construction of Ida B. Wells housing development for low income people and my mother and father applied for an apartment there, and after a serious screening and the like, because at that time they screened families and they were accepted for residents, and we were one of the first, I guess we probably were the seventy-eighth family to move in, because our apartment was number seventy-eight (laughter) in 1941, 1941.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Nineteen forty-one [1941].
Speaker 1: So, you were about eight years old, I guess? Eight (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Forty-one [1941]? No. (Laughter) Thirty-four [1934].
Speaker 1: Oh no, no.
Speaker 2: I really was seven at the time--
Speaker 1: Yeah, seven.
Speaker 2: --because it was before my, I was six.  It was before my seventh birthday.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 352082
Speaker 1: Do you remember Mr. Robert Taylor [Robert Rochon Taylor]?  That they named the Robert Taylor Homes [Chicago, Illinois] after (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No.
Speaker 1: He, I think he was a supervisor of Ida B. Wells [Ida B. Wells Homes, Chicago, Illinois] at one time.
Speaker 2: I don't remember him.  Oscar Brown, Sr. was the supervisor of Ida B. Wells, I think when we moved in, and I was there until I married in 1954, with mom [Bernyce Hayes Wright].  My mother and father [Joseph Wright (ph.)] separated and divorce--separated when I was nine years old in 1944, just before my tenth birthday, I think.
Speaker 1: Hm.  Now, that, well, how did that affect you, you know at that time, I mean, I don't know, we don't, I don't tend to think of people as getting divorced in those days.
Speaker 2: Well, they didn't divorce. They separated.
Speaker 1: They just separated?
Speaker 2: They did not divorce actually (laughter).  The divorce was, I won't say final because I don't know if that was final, but my mother was divorced the week before I was married in 1954, but they separated in 1944.  So, for ten years they were separated, and I don't know, they didn't call it legal separation at that time, but they were separated at that time.  I loved my father and I missed him but he was not at home very much, and so therefore I was very close to my mother as well.  My mother never talked negatively about my father to me, so I never had a problem with that.  I would hear her sometimes talking with her sisters about various things that my father did, and I remember making a comment, made a negative comment about my father, and my mother upbraided me instantly and said, "You will not say anything about your father.  What happened between him and me has nothing to do with you.  That is your father and you will respect him."  And so, that set me straight right then and there.  So, I didn't have that, didn't have that problem.  Of course, I missed him and he did not, it was difficult to get him to live up to his legal responsibility of supporting the child support that he was supposed to get.  I'd go to his job and pick it up every two weeks, that type of thing.
Speaker 1: What did he do for a living?
Speaker 2: He was a co- a laborer.  At that time, they called it a common laborer.  He had no skill but he worked, when he came to Chicago [Illinois], he found employment at a gasoline station.  I think you're out of time, out of tape (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) We've got another minute.  That's all right.
Speaker 2: Oh, is that what it is?  Oh, okay.  He found work, so he did various jobs.  He worked at a gasoline station.  He was self-taught, or someone taught him how to do automobile mechanics, and he also worked at a firm called Chicago Towel Company, where he, I don't know if he sorted laundry but it was at 25th [Street] and Wabash [Avenue], and they provided towels for industry, you know, hand towels and towels that various industries used, and it was like a, I guess maybe it was like a commercial laundry, more or less, and daddy did repairs on trucks and various things and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I know they, they actually used an actual cloth towel in a dispenser.  I know that you'd pull them down on a roll--
Speaker 2: Yes. Um-hm. Right.
Speaker 1: And they would, you know, they would just keep hanging down until they ran out.
Speaker 2: Until they ran out.  Yes, um-hm.  I think that was the, what that industry was, and he did various labor jobs.  When he first came, though, to Chicago, he also worked on the WPA, the Works Progress Association [sic. Work Projects Administration], and that was in the '40s [1940s] and I don't know how he balanced that with working at Coopers greasing palace at 111th [Street] and State [Street], too, but he worked on that project and that's the project that built Lake Shore Drive, the Lake Shore Drive that currently you see.  The lake [Lake Michigan] came up to the railroad track at that time and this WPA under Fra- under President Roosevelt's [President Franklin Delano Roosevelt] administration that was passed in order to provide labor post-Depression [Great Depression] for income.
Story_ID: 351840
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I think I must have reversed my father's [Joseph Wright (ph.)] employment history.  When he came here [Chicago, Illinois] in 1938, I think his first job was on that Works Progress Administration [Work Projects Administration] project, the WPA, where they built Lake Shore Drive. And then, when that ran out he found the job at the Coopers greasing palace is the name at 111th [Street] and State [Street].
Speaker 2: That was the gas station?
Speaker 1: That was the gas station.  That was after, after the WPA.
Speaker 2: Coopers greasing palace.
Speaker 1: Coopers greasing palace.  It was at the corner of 111th and State across from a White Castle, which incidentally is still there.  I mean, it's been rebuilt and modernized and the like, and the biggest treat of my life was for daddy on payday to come home with a bag of White Castle hamburgers (laughter).  They call 'em sliders nowadays.  White Castle hamburgers, and in the newspapers at that time there would be coupons printed for five hamburgers for a quarter or something with this coupon, and we would religiously watch the papers for this coupon so we could give it to daddy when he went out to work that day and he could bring home this bag of hamburgers.
Speaker 2: Now what, what did, how did your mother [Bernyce Hayes Wright] make ends meet?  Did she, she had to work too, I guess--
Speaker 1: Well after, after the marriage began to break out, break up, mother found employment herself and that's when they broke up, with her finding a job and she worked at Alden's Incorporated, which was a mail order house similar Spiegel [Spiegel Inc.] and Montgomery Wards [sic. Montgomery Ward] and the like, and her rationale was if I have to work and daddy was not bringing any income home, then she didn't need him.  She didn't need to take care of him too.  (Laughter) So there we have it.
Speaker 2: So, finance-based breakup (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) It's finance, finance-based and daddy was a handsome guy, and women chased him and I think he chased women.  I think (laughter).  I know he chased women.  So, that was probably the basis of the breakup.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And, my mother being the person she was, would probably have remained in the marriage had he done his financial responsibilities, so that I would have, she would have attempted to have a two-parent household for me.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But, insofar as he did not do that, then they broke up.
Story_ID: 351841
Speaker 1: We have to always say this so that someone watching this later on can get the right idea, but the projects as we know them now, people, you know, return to those and it's a deplorable state, but in those days the projects was a step up from--
Speaker 2: The project was a step up from private housing. Well, from rental housing, let's put it that way (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Which was overcrowded, was overcrowded, and, yeah.
Speaker 2: It was.  It was overcrowded.  All the families were screened.  Many of them were rejected because of various things in their background. I don't know what, but at the time that we, that Ida B. Wells [Ida B. Wells Homes, Chicago, Illinois] was developed--and incidentally I went to school, high school, with her grandchildren--at the time that Ida B. Wells was developed, it was in the heart of the South Side [Chicago, Illinois] black community, the doctors and lawyers and teachers lived in the same community Ida B. Wells, the youngsters and the families who did not live in Ida B. Wells, looked up to the residents of Ida B. Wells as, as respectability, because everyone was in there until they could better.  People were employed and your rent was based on a sliding scale, as things are done now as well--
Speaker 1: They were the up and coming.
Speaker 2: They were the up--well, let's put it this way, at that time, blacks were not considered poor.  They just didn't have any money.  It was not a, indicative of a subcultural-type thing.  They were, they had middle class values, but no money, or little or no money, upwardly mobile, wanting to do better, provide better opportunities for their children than they were able to have themselves, and I think there are many success stories out of Ida B. Wells, such as Doris Davis [Doris A. Davis], who--well Doris was in high school, at Phillips High School [Wendell Phillips High School; Wendell Phillips Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois].  She may not have lived in Ida B. Wells, but she was in the surrounding community.  She was the first black mayor of Compton, California a number of years ago and she was my big sister in high school.  There, I mean, there are just stories and stories and stories, the Duster family, whom I indicated earlier that I went to high school with and those were Ida B. Wells' grandchildren.  Alfreda Wells Duster was their mother, and Ida B. Wells was her mother.  Donald [Donald Duster] and Benjamin [Benjamin Duster] and Charles [Charles Duster] and Troy [HistoryMaker Troy Duster]--and I think Troy is, he may be retired now, but he was professor last at Stanford [Stanford University, Stanford, California], and he may be a HistoryMaker.  Alfreda, Junior may be a HistoryMaker, I mean, but Murrell Duster was married to one of the Dusters and they're divorced.  I think she was married to Donald [sic. Benjamin C. Duster III].  But that was the type of, everybody was striving to make a success of themselves, to move upward, and to make a contribution back to society, that was, and to make a contribution in whatever way.  We all had career goals of professionalism and many of them, many doctors, many attorneys--[HistoryMaker] Lester McKeever was one of my classmates and he probably is a HistoryMaker.  I haven't gone over the entire site.  I've only looked at probably the arts portion, because, I mean, how many interviews do you have and how many people do you have on it, so it would take me months and months to just sit there and go through all of the archives but the movers and shakers of my generation came from three high schools, Wendell Phillips, DuSable [DuSable High School, Chicago, Illinois], and Englewood [Englewood High School, Chicago, Illinois].  Those were the--I'm sorry, Dunbar [Dunbar Vocational High School; Dunbar Vocational Career Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois].  Englewood was, had a few blacks, Hyde Park [Hyde Park High School; Hyde Park Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois] had a few blacks--[HistoryMaker] Herb Kent was one of them, and he was very close to our family as well, he was best buddies with one of my older cousins and growing up in that, what's now called Bronzeville [Chicago, Illinois], 37th [Street] and Giles [Avenue], and then later Herb Kent moved, he and his mother moved into Ida B. Wells as well.
Speaker 1: What was it called when you were coming up, I know, at one time it was called Blackville, but did call it--
Speaker 2: It was always called Bronzeville.
Speaker 1: Bronzeville.
Speaker 2: It was always called Bronzeville.  We had a mayor of Bronzeville, and they still do.  I think Herb and Pearl Griffin are probably the co-mayors of Bronzeville, but we called it Bronzeville, Bronzeville, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay. I think that's a term coined by the Defender [Chicago Defender], I think, right--
Speaker 2: Probably.  It probably was.  Because the founder of Chicago Music Association, Nora Douglas Holt, was the classical music critic of the Defender.
Story_ID: 351842
Speaker 1: So, what were some of the other sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: The esprit de corps among people within the community [Bronzeville, Chicago, Illinois].  The nurturing that went on in the school system--in the elementary [Wendell Phillips Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois] and high school [Wendell Phillips High School; Wendell Phillips Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois] that I attended. The nurturing that went on in the churches that you attended, the friendships that one made at that time were lasting friendships because there were common goals, there were common interests, whether one was musical or one was not musical friendships were based on personalities, getting along and just enjoying one another and one another's company and doing things together and, of course, your, your families directed you.  The church was the, the center of black life at that time.  It was a cultural avenue, it was a religious avenue, it was community based.  Families came together and related and long time, full time relationships were developed in churches, and then you left your own particular church and went out into the wider community and developed friendships with people from other churches, and eventually there was a network.  I can remember we used to go from church to church every Sunday.  There was, some church had a program going on, and so we all went and helped each other at our own churches, went from Hartzell [Hartzell Memorial United Methodist Church, Chicago, Illinois] to Quinn Chapel [Quinn Chapel A.M.E. Church, Chicago, Illinois] to Institutional [First Baptist Institutional Church, Chicago, Illinois] to Pilgrim [Pilgrim Baptist Church, Chicago, Illinois], Olivet [Olivet Baptist Church, Chicago, Illinois], you know all of these children who came from these church-related families, came together and melded as a group, and, as I said, long-lasting relationships were formed.
Story_ID: 351843
Speaker 1: Last Sunday, I attended the fifty-fourth anniversary of my high school class' graduation.  We have a reunion every single year.  That's from Wendell Phillips High School [Wendell Phillips Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois], and there were people there from other classes.  We have a following and people come from, we had people from the class of 1930-some-odd, Porter Myrick [Porter Myrick, Sr.], but he, I think he's kind of home bound now, so he doesn't come too much now, but I think he came out in 1934, the year I was born, and youngsters that I have taught from later classes also come.  There must have been three hundred people present and our class was not that large, and of course, we've lost some to death and illnesses and the like, but people such as Clifton Washington, who now lives in Las Vegas [Nevada] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right. Doctor, Las Vegas. Right.
Speaker 1: Well Clifton was a classmate of mine.  Alvin Ward [ph.], well Cecil Ward [ph.], the older brother of Alvin Ward, psychologist who is out in Arizona--well, Cecil was in Arizona and now I'm not sure if Alvin's in Arizona or not.  [HistoryMaker] Lester McKeever, millionaire, CPA [certified public accountant], attorney, just so many, many, many, many people who have made contributions and, as I was saying, that was our reason for living, you know, to be creative, to discover the talents that we had within us and to nurture them, to improve them, to grow in them and to either perform a service or do that which interested us artists, singers, dancers, businessmen, bankers.  Lucius P. Gregg [HistoryMaker Lieutenant Colonel Lucius P. Gregg], he came out the year before I did and he was the first black to attend Annapolis Naval Academy [United States Naval Academy, Annapolis, Maryland], the first to be appointed to Annapolis.  I think Congressman Dawson [William Dawson] did that. Of course, Congressman Dawson was a legend in himself, too, in black politics here in Chicago [Illinois].  Lucius was at our, he comes every single year.  Jonathan Reed, who's a retried obstetrician--gynecologist and obstetrician--he moved to St. Louis [Missouri] for his practice and, but he was one of my, well he was just ahead of me in high school, but we were all friends and grew up together, so it was just a close knit community. In fact, Ida B. Wells [Ida B. Wells Homes, Chicago, Illinois] was called Wellstown and there was a community newspaper.  During the war, World War II [WWII], everybody had victory gardens under Oscar Brown, Jr., um--Senior, Senior, Senior [Oscar Brown, Sr.] (laughter).  There were plots in the backyard.  Trees were planted and this was part of the architecture and the landscaping of Ida B. Wells at that time.  There were trees, perhaps, in an eight by eight area, bricked in area, and every apartment was given a certain area to cultivate and to grow plants or flowers, or whatever you wanted to do.  Each apartment, each household was responsible for maintaining the cleanliness of the hallways and the areaways and people took pride in it.  It was as if they owned the apartments, which they didn't.  They simply paid rent for it, but everybody did their share and kept the place spic and span and, of course, we had, had the janitorial staff who did the major janitorial work, but you can imagine with apartment buildings, four-story apartment buildings with three to four to five entrances each running from 37th [Street] to 39th Street, and then the townhouse apartments that were, that lay east of Rhodes Avenue on the other side of Madden Park [Madden Park Homes, Chicago, Illinois], it would have been probably an impossible task to supply maintenance and janitorial services for all of those.  I mean, the apartment numbers went up into the thousands, so therefore, everybody kept their area clean.  This was your assignment was.  And we, we swept it weekly and scrubbed the stairs down from the third floor to the second floor, and then the second floor did the second floor to the first floor and the first floor did the first floor, and that kind of thing.  So, it was cooperative living as if you were in something that you owned but you didn't own it, but you felt like you did, and you had pride in your community.

Speaker 1: Now where did you start grade school?
Speaker 2: I started elementary school at Willard [Frances Willard School, Chicago, Illinois] when we were living at 4916 Saint Lawrence [Avenue], and that was right across the street from me.  I attended kindergarten and 1B, as they call it, they were B and A grades then, rather than just one full year in the grade. 1B at Willard and then we moved to Ida B. Wells [Ida B. Wells Homes, Chicago, Illinois], 3723 South Parkway [sic.] was our address, and I was enrolled in Wendell Phillips Elementary School [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Where they placed me in 1B and I said, "I've been in 1B already," and they checked and then said they'd move me to 1A, and of course that was midyear, and from 1A I received a double promotion to 2A, and from 2A a double promotion to 3A, which I would not allow to happen to my child nowadays if I had, if the same circumstances came up.
Speaker 1: Why? Do you think you were just too young?
Speaker 2: Well, because I was too young and then because I missed some crucial concepts in math that were taught at the third grade lev- the beginning of third grade level and that were taught at the beginning of second grade level, you know, so, percentage, I missed percentage because I went from 6A to 7A.  I took 7, went to summer school for 7B and that was the grade where percentage was taught and I missed understanding that and it was only when I got to college [Roosevelt College; Roosevelt University, Chicago, Illinois] and had a professor for college math, a five-hour course who taught high school that my understanding of math really picked up.  I always did it at grade level or above, but never at four years advanced like my reading, and when I got to high school, then I mean to college, and this high school teacher taught us math I understood the concepts and came the breakthrough.
Story_ID: 351845
Speaker 1: Of course, you went to Phillips High School [Wendell Phillips High School; Wendell Phillips Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois]. (Unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I went to Phillips High School, yes.
Speaker 1: And, so you were, I guess, a pretty good student.  I guess, you were always being skipped ahead and--
Speaker 2: Oh, that was from elementary school, and then when I got to high school, I graduated at age, I went to eighth grade at eleven, but by the time I graduated to go to high school, I had made twelve and my other classmates were thirteen and fourteen, and I was always the baby in the class (laughter) and as the baby of the class, you know, they just kind of looked out for me, my big brothers, and they tease me now, even now when we go back for reunions, about my immaturity and how young I was and how they just kind of protected me from anybody.  They wouldn't let anybody bother me and the like, you know, if there was such a thing as bothering.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So they, they looked out for you.  So, now Phillips High School, I know, is--now were you taking music lessons by this time? Or were you--
Speaker 2: You know, I, I was doing my music.  I sang in elementary school.  When I got to high school I was terrified of the acapella teacher and I refused to try out for acapella, but I did join the girls chorus, but I was singing at church and involved in music outside of church, so I didn't find it necessary to actually excel or concentrate, let's say, in music in high school other than the girls chorus.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, music at Phillips is a, is a golden tradition in Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 2: It was.
Speaker 1: Now wasn't Walter Dyett there at that time?
Speaker 2: No, Phillip- Walter Dyett actually was at DuSable [DuSable High School, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: DuSable, okay. Who was the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And that must have been the new Phillips High School when it was built.  I think Phillips burned down and they built a new school and then they decided not to name it Phillips but it became DuSable and Walter Dyett--Walter Dyett taught in Phillips evening school--
Speaker 1: Okay,
Speaker 2: --but he was the bandmaster and the musician--
Speaker 1: At DuSable.
Speaker 2: --at Phillips, I mean at DuSable for years and trained scads and scads of musicians.
Speaker 1: But Phillips didn't have a band, regular leader. I mean the, the wall of fame there is filled with them (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh no, it did not. It's filled with them and there is also arguing and bickering between the DuSable-ites and Phillips-ites as to who went where. [HistoryMaker] Marla Gibbs went to Phillips.  But they fuss about Nat King Cole.  They said, "He went to DuSable.  He did not go to Phillips."  They said, "Well he went to the new Phillips.  It was the new Phillips at that time that became DuSable later."  Same thing for Harold Washington, so, we all claim those, both (laughter) and there's contention but the DuSable-ites and the Phillips-ites claim Nat Cole, they claim Harold Washington, and Dinah Washington.
Speaker 1: Dinah Washington.
Speaker 2: Yes. Oh my dear, Dorothy Donovan [ph.] is so funny.  She was a very dear friend.  I met her late in, late, later on in life, but she said, "I gave Dinah Washington her name."  I said, "You did?"  She said, "Yes.  Her name was Ruth Jones and I asked what is your name, girl?"  And she said, "Ruth Jones."  She said, "You'll never make it anywhere with that name.  Change your name.  Dinah Washington."  And she did.  And Dorothy was right (laughter).
Story_ID: 351846
Speaker 1: Was there any attention given to classical music at Phillips [Wendell Phillips High School; Wendell Phillips Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois] when you there (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, definitely.  In fact, that's what the acapella, that's what the girls' chorus, that's what the boys' chorus sang, classical music, folk music, spirituals, the Negro spiritual.  Of course, that's the expression of the soul to black folks who made it through the Middle Passage and it's the only American music, original American music, I guess besides that indigenous music of the Native American black music, that's the soul, that is the beginning of American music. All of the music out of the American music tradition came from black music.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, were you involved in clubs and that sort of thing in high school?
Speaker 2: In high school, I was a member of the Tri-Hi-Y.  Those were organizations for girls and the Hi-Ys were organizations for boys and they took Greek letters as their names, similar to sororities and fraternities, and there was always a leader, a mentor who was associated with each one, similar to a counselor, more or less, and we did cultural activities, we did community-based activities, we had dances, we met people who were not like us.  It was, there were service organizations at the high school level, built, patterned after the fraternities and sororities, but not as extensive as those organizations.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Abraham Lincoln Centre [Chicago, Illinois] was a cultural, a center of culture.  There were music teachers there.  Many students took dance, many, or took piano or voice lessons, or choral.  They were involved in that Abraham Lincoln Centre.  It was a beacon in the community and at 700 Oakwood Boulevard, it wasn't far from Ida B. Wells [Ida B. Wells Homes, Chicago, Illinois].  The Oakland branch library was located in there as well.  It was a residence for people.  There was a dean, and all of a sudden I have forgotten his name, I can't think of it, but I did meet that dean of Abraham Lincoln Centre that was prior to the new center being built at 38th [Street] and Cottage [Cottage Grove Avenue], which Ace Ellis [Othello Ellis] (unclear) was the executive director of.  Incidentally, he was a member of the church [St. Mark United Methodist Church, Chicago, Illinois] that I'm a member of now, so I knew him very well.
Speaker 1: Yeah, the old side of Abraham Lincoln Centre is now the Northeastern Illinois Center for Inner City Studies [Jacob H. Carruthers Center for Inner City Studies, Chicago, Illinois] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, Center for Inner City Studies, right.  Um-hm.
Story_ID: 351847
Speaker 1: Well it was an exciting time to be in high school in Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 2: It was, it was.  As I indicated, there were three black high schools and, so because the black community--well, I should not say that.  There were three black high schools on the South Side [Chicago, Illinois].  That does not mean that there weren't--Marshall High School [John Marshall Metropolitan High School] on the West Side [Chicago, Illinois] was the center for those who lived on the West Side.  There was a West Side group of blacks who had lived there for generations.  And everyone on the West Side and everyone on the South Side was not a recent migrant coming to Chicago for a better way of life.  Some had been there for maybe several generations, some families had, and then other people came to Chicago and the general pattern, and you know, when we do generalizations, (laughter) we're apt to not be accurate because it's kind of a middle ground, but in many instances, blacks who were migrating from the South to the North moved to the West Side and then, as they got their feet on to the ground, then they would move to the South Side.  It did not always happen, but that was kind of the general pattern, with the exception of those long-time landed blacks who were there.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think I, I understand (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And so you know about--
Speaker 1: I think you're right.  As a generalization, it's probably true.
Speaker 2: Yes. Um-hm, um-hm.  As a generalization, it is.
Speaker 1: That's probably true, so--
Speaker 2: But, you asked about high school and the exciting time it was; yes, I remember, I was to meet this man many, many years later and that was [HistoryMaker] William Warfield, but when we were in high school, William Warfield had just made his Town Hall [The Town Hall, New York, New York] debut. And I guess we were juniors at that time, because he made his Town Hall debut in New York City [New York, New York], I think, 1950, and I graduated in 1951.  Well, right after that, he came to Chicago [Illinois] and, of course, he was programmed to visit Phillips High School [Wendell Phillips High School; Wendell Phillips Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois], because that was the quote, leading high school (laughter) in the community and he was going to sing several selections for us in an assembly and the music teachers weren't able to play what he was going to sing, and it actually was an aria from Handel's [George Frideric Handel] 'Messiah,' "Why Do the Nations" ["Why Do the Nations Rage"] and so they got my best girlfriend, who was fourteen years old, out of class to come and play for him for this assembly (laughter) which was really, I mean, that spoke to the ability, the artistic ability of youngsters who were growing up at that time and how we were immersed into music, instrumental, I took piano for about four or five years, but I learned early on that I would never be a concert pianist, but singing was my forte as it was (laughter) and it was choral singing at that time in high school, elementary, high school, until I married, as I indicated out there, and my husband [Harry Pryor II] said, "You have a classical voice," and then I took it beyond that point.
Story_ID: 350685
Speaker 1: After [HistoryMaker] William Warfield made his Town Hall [The Town Hall] debut in New York City [New York, New York], he came to Chicago [Illinois] and they had him scheduled to visit with the students as our role model and mentor, and then as a person who has made world history by making this Town Hall debut and being such a wonderful artist, and the teachers were not able to accompany him on the songs that he had selected specifically from Handel's [George Frideric Handel] 'Messiah,' "Why Do The Nations" ["Why Do the Nations Rage"], and so my fourteen year old girlfriend, who was the youngest in my high school [Wendell Phillips High School; Wendell Phillips Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois] class--I was the second youngest--(laughter) was taken out of class to come and accompany him.  That is the level of musicianship that you found in some of the young people in that day and it was nurtured by the church, there were music teachers in the community, you went to, you took your lessons in the community.  You didn't, there weren't, well, I'm sure there were conservatories and things, but they were not open to us because all of our artistic persons were in the community.  They were in churches.  People with bachelor's [degree] and master's degrees worked at the post office, which was the best place for gainful employment and they practiced their art in the churches.  They were church musicians and very, very competent.  They taught a balanced, a well-balanced curriculum, let's say, of music; the classics, spirituals, the true gospel, not the stuff that goes on today that's not that far from rap, (laughter) but the true gospel, the gospel of Thomas Dorsey and it was the forum for life in the black community.

Speaker 1: Upon graduating from high school [Wendell Phillips High School; Wendell Phillips Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois], I attended Chicago Teachers College [Chicago State University, Chicago, Illinois], in the meantime, I met the man that I was to marry and I left college after a year and worked for a couple of years and then we married and then I went back to school after my son was born.  I went back to school to complete my education, so from 1951 to 1961--I entered college in '51 [1951] and I graduated in '61 [1961], and all of these things had taken place during that time.
Speaker 2: So, did you graduate from Chicago Teachers College (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I graduated from Chicago Teachers College, which became Chicago State University.
Speaker 2: Okay. Right. And you didn't know--
Speaker 1: After, I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: Now, you didn't major in music.  You majored in counseling, right?
Speaker 1: No, I did not.  I majored in education, actually, with a focus on social science and English literature.  I took music courses at the university level, as I indicated, harmony and sight-singing, ear training, conducting, and all that, and then my husband encouraged me to go back to the conservatory where he had attended and where he attended actually and study with his teacher after we married (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Now, he was a, yeah he was a musician, right?  What was his name?
Speaker 1: Harry Leonard Pryor.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Harry Leonard Pryor, II [Harry Pryor II].
Speaker 2: You all, you were married in what, 1954?
Speaker 1: Married in 1954.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And he passed in 20- 1984.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And he encouraged me to go back and study classical music as I indicated prior to our official interview that, at that time, being married, having home responsibilities and a child, it was not prudent to attempt to seek a career in music, in vocal performance, even if I were inclined to, but at that time, there were such limitations on what you could do that we did the church circuit, we did the recitals, concerts, and choral music, of course, was our institution.  That was our, our life, livelihood.
Speaker 2: Now, when you were (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) By livelihood, I mean that was our cultural outlet.
Story_ID: 350687
Speaker 1: What part do you sing?  You're a contralto, right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I'm a contralto, mezzo-contralto was my vocal category.
Speaker 1: Right.  Is that the same range as Marian Anderson? Was that--
Speaker 2: It is.  Yes.
Speaker 1: All right. I thought it was.
Speaker 2: Well, actually I think Marian Anderson began as a soprano, and, because she could sing high and early in her career, but she was considered a contralto.  The only mezzo contraltos that I know of were my later teacher Sonia Sharnova, Eda Moltan [ph.] and myself, with that voice category, meaning that you could sing the height of a mezzo-con- mezzo-soprano, which is a second soprano, which is lower than soprano, but you could sing that high and you could also sing low.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You either have a contralto who has that low voice, or you have a mezzo, who has that medium voice and a soprano goes higher than that, but for a mezzo contralto, that means I could sing low and medium high as well.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: And the arms are going (laughter).
Speaker 1: Now did you, I mean, we didn't talk about this but did you idolize Marian Anderson when she was coming along?
Speaker 2: I did. I did. When I was in elementary school, our music teacher played recordings for us for music appreciation for exposure in the like, and because we weren't able to go to concerts and things, and Marian Anderson was not in the city [Chicago, Illinois] often, you know.  She did a lot, but she did more in Europe, basically, than she did in the United States, but we heard recordings by Marian Anderson and by Dorothy Maynor and Paul Robeson, Roland Hayes, all of the great singers of that day and age, [HistoryMaker] William Warfield and the like.  Leontyne Price made her advent after I was out of high school [Wendell Phillips High School; Wendell Phillips Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois]; in fact, she, Leontyne, oh my goodness, Leontyne will be eighty next year.  Isn't that wonderful?  February 10, 1927, that's her birth date.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And she is just as gorgeous now as she was all along.  She did her last recital here in 1970, at Orchestra Hall [Symphony Center, Chicago, Illinois].  She was printed, presented in recital and I was there and--age seventy, I'm sorry, 1997 was when she, and it was actually around her birthday.  I don't remember if it was on her birthday but after this glorious singing that she had done, somewhere past the middle of the recital one of the audience members yelled out, "It's nothing but a number," because she was seventy and was singing as gloriously as she did earlier, early on. (Cough) I'm gonna have to take a sip. And I went back stage after that particular recital, as I said it was her last here.  We didn't know it was going to be her last, but it was, and Uncle Bill, well we called him, William Warfield, Uncle Bill, all of his students and colleagues and the like called him Uncle Bill.  So, we all went back stage afterwards, and some friends, some colleagues, co-members from St. Mark Church [St. Mark United Methodist Church, Chicago, Illinois] who grew up in Laurel, Mississippi with Leontyne--and it was just a glorious backstage meeting, so personable and she was the ideal and she was the symbol to black musicians that this is the breakthrough.  It can be done. Of course, as I said when she came along, I don't put myself in her category at all because I did not have the level of training that she had.  She started early on and did it consistently.  When she married it was after her career began, because she and Bill met, well knew each other more personally when they did 'Porgy and Bess' [George Gershwin] together and then, of course, that's when they married during that, and I think they were married like ten years before they divorced and they went their separate ways but they remained friends for, forever, actually, from that time on.  But, I'm getting away from what we were talking about.
Story_ID: 350688
Speaker 1: What is the proper age to start?  Now, you started taking formal lessons in your twenties, right?  Early twenties (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, really the voice does not mature until about age twenty-five, it, unlike learning instruments like violin and other instruments.  You can do that and you make accomplishments.  You become more polished and more capable of handling your instrument and performing, the earlier you start with piano and with stringed instruments or woodwinds, or whatever.  But, with the voice, with the maturation of the voice being much slower than the maturation of the motor skills, because you're growing, you know, as boys change, grow when their voices change, they go from talking up here to becoming tenors or bases and the voice gets middle or lower and it's a consistent change of technique in order to produce the voice.  Studying voice at an early age is beneficial in that it teaches a person how to place the voice in the body structure and how to produce the tone, but as your body grows and develops, and as your vocal cords mature, you have to make adjustments in that in order to focus the tone properly and you don't get your normal sound, your natural sound, your final sound in voice until around age twenty-five, and that's why voice contestants usually are older when, they are allowed to be older when cate- when they're in competitions because of the maturation of the voice being slower.  It's matched with the maturation of the body.
Speaker 1: Now, is there an age when the voice starts to deteriorate or--
Speaker 2: It's, you know, it is, it's based on the individual.  It's an individual-type thing.  Nell Hunter, who was a classical singer, she never made it big on the major stages of the world, but she was a Chicago [Illinois] musician.  She sang up into her nineties, and still had very good control of her voice.  Marian Anderson's voice began to decline in her sixties.  She began to sing under in pitch.  So, it's basically--Leontyne [Leontyne Price] did her last recital at age seventy.  Bill Warfield [HistoryMaker William Warfield] did a recital at Pick-Staiger Concert Hall [Evanston, Illinois] back in, I think, 2000, 'cause Uncle Bill died.  He died eight days after I married my present husband [George Williams], 'cause he was supposed to sing for our wedding and he fell and broke his collar bone and was in the hospital and was unable to sing, but he did a recital in the year 1999 or 2000 at Pick-Staiger, and the voice was just as strong as it could be and he was, see Uncle Bill was born in 1920; January 22, 1920, yeah, so at that time he was like, what, eighty, eighty some odd years old, and he was still singing.  The voice still had the timbre, it still had the quality, the resonance that he always had.  He didn't have the control of it that he once had, and that's what happens.  The muscles get looser and you don't have, maybe, the control and so you have to adjust your repertoire so that you don't try, you don't sing those things that are so far out, you know, that require you to sing very, very high or that call for long breath, breathing phrases because the breath lessens.  You're not able to sustain it as long.  I find that now, at this age, I'm not able to sustain the tones as I don't have the breath control that I had as a younger person, but that's part of the human (laughter) physiology.
Story_ID: 350689
Speaker 1: When did you sing your first solo con-?  I mean, when did you first perform as a solo contralto--
Speaker 2: I guess my first solo really was with a choral group, with my husband's [Harry Pryor II] choral group, the Dorian Choral Ensemble, and we were headquartered at the Washington Park YMCA [Chicago, Illinois] there at 50th [Street] and Indiana [Avenue].  That was our rehearsal space, and I sang solos with the chorus and then that's when he encouraged me to--and I was also alto in the choral group and that's when I was encouraged by him to go back and study, so I sang in concerts at Chicago conservatory of music, and at various churches as I indicated.  Those were the center, that was the center of the cultural life, because we didn't sing at Orchestra Hall [Symphony Center, Chicago, Illinois] and we weren't, we couldn't sing at various places, Lyric Opera [Civic Opera House, Chicago, Illinois] and the like, so I sang at Monumental Baptist Church [Chicago, Illinois] at Quinn Chapel A.M.E. Church [Chicago, Illinois], at Woodlawn A.M.E. Church [Chicago, Illinois], St. Mark United Methodist [St. Mark United Methodist Church, Chicago, Illinois], St. James United Methodist [St. James United Methodist Church, Chicago, Illinois], and at that time, and Greater Bethesda [Greater Bethesda Missionary Baptist Church, Chicago, Illinois], St. John Church-Baptist [Greater St. John Baptist Church, Chicago, Illinois], the entire Hartzell Methodist Church [Hartzell United Methodist Church, Chicago, Illinois], the entire, those were the performing arenas.  We sang for general conferences at the old Coliseum [Chicago Coliseum] here in Chicago [Illinois].  That was as children, and also as children we sang at Soldier Field [Chicago, Illinois] because there was an annual Chicago Tribune Chicagoland Music Festival, and in which various musical organizations were presented in the like and J. Wesley Jones of Metropolitan Community Church [Chicago, Illinois], and there was always a mass black choir brought to sing music of black composers and spirituals and the like at that event, and they also had a competition in which someone won first prize as a singer in Chicagoland, and I never was part of that but I was always part of the mass choir.  I was, believe it or not, I was bashful and didn't want anybody to hear my voice and it was only after my husband encouraged me and insisted that I go back that I began to sing more freely and not mind singing solo-wise.  At the time that we were doing, of course 'Messiah' [George Frideric Handel] is a staple in the black community, Maudline Kelly [ph.] on the West Side [Chicago, Illinois], she was the first black hired by the Chicago Park District to teach music back in the '30s [1930s] probably, probably during the WPA [Works Progress Administration; Work Projects Administration] area [sic. era].  They had a 'Messiah' at Mozart Avenue Baptist Church [Mozart Baptist Church], which is now First Baptist Congregational Church [Chicago, Illinois] and Arthur D. Griffin was the former--he's retired now--but he was pastor of that church, is the center of culture on the West Side.  And in the various churches on the South Side [Chicago, Illinois], each church did a 'Messiah' presentation and they hired soloists who were classically trained, and so I was part of that cadre of soloists, as was my colleague, [HistoryMaker] Earl Calloway.  He's a tenor, from the Defender [Chicago Defender].  He's a tenor and he would sing solos as well, and he still conducts it as well but the musicians, who were the instrumentalists, were hired from the Local 10 musicians union [Chicago Federation of Musicians Local 10-208], and they were members of the Lyric Opera Orchestra, and the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, and that is how on my resume it indicates that I have sung with members of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and the Lyric Opera Orchestra, because they accompanied me on various concerts and they were hired as musicians to accompany.  So, I have done 'Messiahs,' I've done--well, on the bio that I gave you, there are many oratorios that I have sung. As a, an older person studying music, and I say older people of my family responsibilities, I did not, I told you, I majored in voice performance but it was not for opera purposes, for being in operas or learning opera.  It was for church singing, for oratorios, for recitals.  Oratorios, and there are a wealth of them, and at the time that I was coming along, the black churches did a lot of classical singing and presenting of oratorios, which are sacred works, telling stories in music, biblical stories in music.  And then those who were always accompanied by professional musicians.
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That was a church circuit.
Story_ID: 350690
Speaker 1: In 1961, Irving Bunton, who is now, he's a retired supervisor of music with the Chicago Public Schools, but he formulated, called together singers and colleagues of his to form a musical unit called Chicago Concert Choral and we did sacred works, Poulenc [Francis Poulenc] 'Mass,' ['Mass in G Major'] we did various, Mozart [Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart] 'Requiem,' we did various oratorios and classical works similar to what the Chicago Symphony Orchestra Chorus does, but this was an opportunity for blacks who were classically trained or interested in seeing classical music, for a great number of them to come together in music.  At that time, in 1962, Duke Ellington was in the process of, he had been commissioned to write a show to commemorate the centennial of the Emancipation Proclamation and our organization, our Chicago Concert Choral was one of the choral groups that went to audition to be the chorus in this particular work and Duke selected us as the choral group to appear in his musical revue entitled 'My People.'  And, as I said, it commemorated the hundredth anniversary of the Emancipation Proclamation and it showed the progress that Negroes had made.  That was the terminology of the day in that one hundred years in the arts, in literature, in science, in, in all arenas, but especially in music.  And, as a result of that, being in that, in the chorus and being part of the cast because the chorus was used to depict various scenes and the like, in 1968, when Duke came to do his sacred concerts that he had begun at that time, he said that, you know, the first, that first portion of his life he had done jazz and, in fact, he didn't call it jazz. Music is a beyond category.  Those are his words.  Music is, there are only two kinds of music, good music and bad music, and so, and that was his terminology as well.  But he said he was going to spend the rest of his life because he had been so blessed in doing sacred music, so then he did these sacred concerts one [A Concert of Sacred Music], two [Second Sacred Concert], and three [Third Sacred Concert].  Well, he was contracted to come to Chicago [Illinois] to do a sacred concert at the Auditorium Theatre [Chicago, Illinois] and I was sought as the choral director to train the chorus for this performance.  It was November 8, I think, 1968.  I was only five years old.  I was just a prodigy (laughter) and that was the, the 1963 experience with 'My People' and the 1968 experience of being his choral director were the highlights of my life, to work with this genius who had composed more than three thousand pieces in his lifetime, and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I remember from that period seeing him on television, on Sunday morning, on CBS, with, I think the New York Philharmonic, or something, you know.
Speaker 1: Yes.  He was an amazing person.  I just adored him.  In fact when Mercedes [HistoryMaker Mercedes Ellington], his granddaughter, and I worked together at later years.  I told her, you know, "I was in love with your grandfather," (laughter) and we had a big laugh about that.  And, in love as far as being, adoring him and seeing him for, as the person he was.  He was a magnificent person.  He was a humanitarian.  He was truly America's cultural ambassador.  They designated that he was and he was.  I mean, he did state department tours and the like, and just spread, he was just full of love, just full of it and embraced all sorts of humanity, gave dignity to people in all walks of life.  He was a magnificent person.

Speaker 1: But, at any rate, I, that was an experience that I will never forget, being choral director and training that choir [Chicago Concert Choral], and I put together fourteen voices for the Auditorium Theatre [Chicago, Illinois], and when we went for rehearsal that afternoon, his advance man, Tom Whaley [Thomas Whaley], came in from New York [New York] to work with us and to see that we were on track with getting the music and learning and the like, and Duke [Duke Ellington] didn't hear us until the afternoon when we did the dress rehearsal prior to the show [Duke Ellington's Second Sacred Concert], and he said, "Fourteen voices?  This is all you have?"  And we said, "Yes."  "Well, they'll prob- we're gonna have to mic them." And we, these fourteen voices opened up and he said, "Boy, these cats can sing" (laughter) and their voices bounced off the back--of course, the Auditorium Theatre has perfect acoustics you know. It's acoustically perfect (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah it's acoustically, right, that's what they say.
Speaker 1: And it. And it is.  You can whisper in there.  If you know how to project your voice, it will go to the back and you can hear it.  But he was so impressed, and it was, as I said, it was the thrill of my lifetime.  Skipping ahead--
Speaker 2: But did you, you were, you were directing his original music?
Speaker 1: Yes, it was his original music.  He took music from the 'My People' ex- work, some music, and he composed new music to go along with it and reworked some things and created the sacred concerts out of them.  And, the crowning glory, because he had passed away by that time, was in 1998, when the sixteenth international Duke Ellington concert, I'm sorry, sixteenth international Duke Ellington conference, was coming to Chicago [Illinois].  I was asked if I thought it a possibility that I could get in touch with people to recreate the 1963 'My People' review.  The problem was that Duke never wrote it down.  The music was there, but he never wrote the show down in show form.  I was in the show and I remembered it from curtain to curtain.  So, I took eleven months and recreated the script from the beginning through the end of the show.  I was able to contact Bill Berry, trumpeter, and some of the orchestra members who had reel-to-reel tapes of our recording at the studio when he did the record, the cast record, and was able, Bill Berry made copies of everything and sent them to me and we gave them to Charlie Harrison [Charles Harrison], who was associate conductor of the Chicago Jazz Orchestra with Jeff Linberg, Lindberg [Jeff Lindberg].  He was centered here in Evanston [Illinois] at that time, and a tremendous musician.  He took those audio tapes, transcribed the charts for the orchestra and we were off and running.  I had written the script, Mercedes [HistoryMaker Mercedes Ellington] flew into town and I went over with her what went from scene to scene, with scenes segued because it started off in the African jungle and it brought us up to the present day in black life in America, and on the, and at that time when we did the show in 1963, Billy Strayhorn was still alive too, so I got to work with him and we had recordings of his playing the celesta in the studio because they couldn't have a piano in there, so they had to use the little celeste and he was accompanying us on that.  At any rate, the show was a success.  It was so expensive to put on that it never, we weren't able to do it again, and I had the very, should I say bitter experience as a result of it because the person who was chairperson [HistoryMaker Josie Childs] of the sixteenth international conference that was held here in Chicago, did not pay me and everybody else got paid (laughter).
Story_ID: 361041
Speaker 1: When the sixteenth international Duke Ellington conference was brought to Chicago [Illinois], it was chaired by [HistoryMaker] Josie Childs, and [HistoryMaker] Geraldine de Haas allowed her, some, they were friends and she got Jazz Unites to kind of sponsor or co-sponsor the event under its umbrella more or less.
Speaker 2: So Jazz Unites was the fund- I mean the conduit through which all of (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Through, yes.  Through what, the funds that were raised, but, and Dick Wang [Richard Wang] was part of the original committee and when he found out that Josie was going to be chairperson of it, he backed out.  He would not have anything to do with it.  You know Dick Wang, jazz, eminent jazz musician, expert, and the like, probably is retired now from the University of Illinois at Circle Campus [University of Illinois at Chicago Circle; University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, Illinois], but he's said, "No, no no. I will not have part of this," because he was aware of her history.  Unilateral decisions, you have a committee, you use a lot of people's names and you don't do what you're supposed to do.  The funds that were raised were more than enough to pay the expenses of the production itself.  [HistoryMaker] Mercedes Ellington had to fight to get her pay and she said, "Never again will I work with this woman.  Never again."  All of the bills were paid with the exception of mine and at this time, I knew Josie through a church that I was singing with and we had gotten to be somewhat friends and she knew of my history with Ellington [Duke Ellington] and knew of the knowledge that I had of him and his music, and so in a telephone conference call with Mercedes, when I called Mercedes to see if she would choreograph the remake of this show [Duke Ellington's Second Sacred Concert], we both stated what our fees would be and Mercedes was a witness to--my fee was to be three thousand dollars and we're talking about 1997 for a 1998 production.  That was to produce, meaning to go into my head, and sit down and it took me eleven months to recreate the script and I still have the script.  I gave Mercedes a copy of it and refused to give anybody else.  I recreated the script.  Through Josie's phonebook, who she has the phone number of everybody she has ever met in life, we were able to contact Bill Berry, to get the--and he said, "Yes, I do have the reel-to-reel tapes.  I'll make them for you and send it to you."  And, through Robert Harris [HistoryMaker Robert A. Harris] at Northwestern University [Evanston, Illinois], professor of music there, he's been there since 1977, we knew of Charlie Harrison [Charles Harrison], who, he's a fine guitarist and conductor and has the ability to listen to a tape and transcribe it for various instruments, to recreate the Ellington sound.  We got David Baker from Indiana University [Bloomington, Indiana] to come, and he was the orchestra conductor.  I sang one piece, the heritage piece ['My Mother, My Father (Heritage)'], "My mother the greatest and the prettiest," and did the, wrote the script and staged it.  Mercedes served as the stage director under my direction, telling her what had to be done.  It was done at the New, at the Regal, the New Regal [New Regal Theater; Avalon Regal Theater, Chicago, Illinois] on 79th [Street], and the scenery was built according to my recollection and a picture that was on the cast album so they were able to create the scaffold, not scaffolding but the raised stage portion that was central to the action, and it was attended by all of the delegates to that sixteenth international conference, and it was a hit.  We brought in Robert Morris, who I said was the ghost writer for Duke's 'My People' back in 1963.  He was a music student at the time, but that was in 1963.  He was a student at DePaul University School of Music [Chicago, Illinois], and I suggested getting him because with him having been the ghost writer, the arranger for the choral parts, and he had a choral group in Minneapolis [Minnesota] where he was located.  He was a professor at Macalester College [Saint Paul, Minnesota] at that time, it was more feasible to have him because he didn't have to learn the music.  He knew it because he wrote it.  He arranged it, so he taught it to his chorus and brought them down.  The chorus got their fee.  Robert did not get his equal fee of three thousand dollars and I did not get my equal fee of three thousand dollars, although the income that was generated to produce the show more than paid for the expenses of it, and I don't know what she did with the rest of the money.  I just don't know.

Speaker 1: Chuck Sherrell, Charles Sherrell, of WBON, WBON, Charles Sherrell, GCI, wait a minute, BEE, (laughter) I'm getting it wrong.  Charles is gonna kill me.  I think it was WBEE-AM [WBEE Radio, Harvey, Illinois] on the radio.  He was the general present--
Speaker 2: I remember his name.  I can't think of which one it is (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) He didn't even get a ticket [to the sixteenth international Duke Ellington conference] to come in and he was one of the prime ones raising funds to put the show on.  He was so dismayed.  Tim Black [HistoryMaker Timuel Black] was part of the, he was on Jazz Unites board and Tim, God love him, will not take a stand one way or the other.  If there's conflict, "Well you know how Josie [HistoryMaker Josie Childs] is."  That's his answer, you know, and you can imagine how angry I was.  I went to the lawyers for creative arts and talked with him with reference to suing. Barbara Kinsey [ph.] of Kinsey and Kinsey.  She did not--I'm sorry, there are three of us who did not get paid.  She had done publicity up to maybe seven or eight thousand dollars she was owed, and we talked together about putting together a law suit and the two, with Robert [Robert Morris] being in Minneapolis [Minnesota], he said "I'll do whatever, you know, whatever you two do."  Barbara elected to just let it go and not pursue it, because she didn't, it was just too much of a hassle, so that left me and I said, "Well, you know what?  That's a three thousand dollar lesson to me.  Never engage in anything with a friend on a professional level without a contract, trusting the friendship is going to be observed."  It was a hard lesson to learn.  I mean, I didn't starve as a result of it.  It was additional income for me, but it was not, at that time I was a widow, had been a widow for fourteen, yeah fourteen years, so it was, could have been used, you know, but--sixteen year- fourteen years.  My husband [Harry Pryor II] died in '84 [1984].  But, that was the bitter experience, and so we see one another in passing.  My mother [Bernyce Hayes Wright] was the type of person who is a loving person and she said, "Don't bear grudges because it tears you down."  So, for that reason, you know, I don't bear grudges.  I see Josie in passing, and I will speak and keep going and that's it.  But that's the story.  That's the way people will do (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Unfortunately this happens way too often and to a lot of people.
Speaker 1: It does, it does.  But you think, you know, you're engaged with a friend and you're doing this and she knew what my experience was with Ellington [Duke Ellington] and we had, had collaborated, actually, on a sacred concert back in 1994, and I should have known better then, because Mercedes [HistoryMaker Mercedes Ellington] came in to do that.  She did that for the Park Manor Congregational Church [Congregational Church of Park Manor, Chicago, Illinois].  It was to be their anniversary fundraiser, and it was put on at Christ Universal Temple [Chicago, Illinois], because that was a large area.  It seated three thousand people, you know, and so I was consultant on that one.  I didn't have to any training or anything.  Bob Harris, Robert Harris [HistoryMaker Robert A. Harris] from Northwestern [Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois] conducted the orchestra, and some of the alumnae from Ellington's orchestra came.  I think Britt Woodman came at that time.  He's deceased now, and Clark Terry came in as trumpeter and he was suffering from arthritis so badly at that time, but he managed to do it and get back up, get up on the stage, you know, and do the performance and at that time, they videoed it and what I saw, I volunteered my time.  This was not for pay.  When I saw the preliminary, my name was nowhere on that and I helped get the chorus together, (laughter) I got Robert Harris, so I should have known.  I really should have known better.  Four years later when she called about the, 'My People,' but it was such an important piece of history, this review that Duke, who had died in 1974, had put together 1963, and this international group of people, I mean they're coming from all types of countries.  They were just aficionados of Ellingtonia, and I said this is too important a piece, and I can do this for posterity as it were, but my previous experience should have taught me something.  For some reason, it didn't.  Artistic took over and there I did it.
Story_ID: 361043
Speaker 1: Tell us about the, about the, I'm still trying to get the name right, like I had it wrong earlier, but the Chicago Music Association and its origins in 1919; that's a long time ago (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It's a long time ago.  Yes, for the very reasons that we were talking about, the discrimination against blacks and the performing arts, Nora Douglas Holt, who was the music critic for the Chicago Defender, called together musicians, black musicians here in Chicago [Illinois], and they were all professionally trained and to form an organization in which blacks could perform on stage concerts and classical music and create music themselves, and to promote the use of a Negro spiritual as indigenous form of music to this country.  She called musicians up around Chicago and they established this organization called Chicago Music Association.  It was to provide performance venues for blacks who were traditionally left out when it came to performing on major concert halls and opera, opera stages.  At the same time, or in fact prior to 1919, these series of meetings took place before 1919, but Chicago Music Association was officially formed on March 3 of 1919.  At the same time that all of this was going on, Henry Grant [Henry L. Grant] in Washington, D.C. was attempting to form an organization composed of black musicians nationally, Negro musicians, that was the terminology then, Negro musicians nationally, for the same reason.  Incidentally, Henry Grant was Duke Ellington's high school music teacher in Washington, D.C. And he actually was the first president of the National Association of Negro Musicians [NANM] after it was formed.  Well, they heard about this fledging, fledgling group in Chicago and they contacted Nora Douglas Holt, and said we'd like to come and meet with you, and so musicians came from all around the country and met in Chicago during the last of July and the first of August 1919, during the most horrendous race riot that ever occurred here in Chicago.  They met at the Wabash Avenue YMCA [Chicago, Illinois], and from accounts of the recording secretary that we have in our archives, they could hear the noise of the riot that was going on further to the north, the shots and various things that were going on.  They met and they hammered out and they saw and were led by Chicago Music Association as to how they came into formation and the purposes and what they did, their constitution and the like, and out of these meetings, the National Association of Negro Musicians was formed and Chicago became the first chapter, even though it preceded, so NANM was formed like August 9th.  Earl [HistoryMaker Earl Calloway] can correct me.  He remembers those dates.  It was either August 8th or August 9th of 1919, and Chicago Music Association was formed March 3, 1919.
Story_ID: 361044
Speaker 1: The first scholarship was granted to Marian Anderson during that conference in 1919, and it consisted of two hundred and fifty dollars, but, and when she eventually got it, they raised funds and we just potted up money.  They heard this beautiful, it was not a competition.  She sang for them and the assembly made pledges and contributed money to provide a scholarship for her so that she could go to Europe and study further.
Speaker 2: Well, two hundred and fifty dollars, in those days--
Speaker 1: It was a lot of money.  She didn't get it right away, but when she did get it she went to Europe on it (laughter) and there she met, can I say it, Kosti Vehanen who was one of Jean Sibelius' colleagues.  He became her first accompanist, actually, in Finland, Finland.
Speaker 2: He's the, Sibelius is the author of 'Finlandia.'
Speaker 1: Yes, yes.  Well, Kosti, K-O-S-T-I, Vehanen, V-E-H-A-N-E-N, was an associate of his and he became Marian Anderson's accompanist, succeeded by Franz Rupp in later years.  But Chicago Music Association then took on a role of leadership, the National Association of Negro Musicians [NANM], its headquarters is now in Chicago [Illinois], although its officers live all around the country, but the executive office is here in Chicago, and there are branches all around the country now in various cities and states, the West Coast, Las Vegas [Nevada], there is the Jester Hairston branch [Jester Hairston Music Association] is in Las Vegas named for you know whom, Rolly [Rolly Forbes] of, what was it, 'Good Times,' not 'Good Times', Rolly on the Sherman Hemsley show, 'Amen,' that's what it was, 'Amen.'
Speaker 2: 'Amen,' okay.
Speaker 1: Jester Hairston was a very fine classical musician and he also wrote, arranged a lot of spirituals and in his later years, he went to television, he was on that 'Amen' show.  There are, as I said, chapters, there are several chapters in New York [New York], Norfolk [Virginia], Atlanta [Georgia], New Jersey, Detroit [Michigan], the one in Columbus [Ohio] is defunct.  There was a Columbus.  Cleveland [Ohio] is defunct too.  William Wilson [sic. Todd Wilson], who was at Cleveland Institute of Music [Cleveland, Ohio], used to be the chairperson or the president of that group, but they've kind of fallen by the wayside.  Denver [Colorado], Akron [Ohio]--
Speaker 2: [HistoryMaker] Charles Burrell part of it in Denver or?
Speaker 1: I don't recognize that name.  Bennie Williams is, and Bennie Williams is a female.  She's [HistoryMaker] Dianne Reeves' high school teacher, and she's the one who coached Dianne Reeves, the jazz singer (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Dianne Reeves is Charles Burrell's niece.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well then he's part of it, then.
Speaker 2: Charles Burrell, he plays bass, I mean, yeah bass fiddle for the, violin for the--
Speaker 1: I'm thinking of Kenny Burrell (laughter).
Speaker 2: For the Denver Symphony [Denver Symphony Orchestra].
Speaker 1: Okay.  I'm thinking of Kenny Burrell.
Speaker 2: He also plays jazz too, but Dianne Reeves is his niece.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, Dianne, Bennie Williams was her high school teacher and Dianne often tells this story of when she was in high school and she was, they were doing a Mozart [Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart] or Bach [Johann Sebastian Bach] piece, J.S. Bach piece and she began to (laughter) improvise and Bennie stopped and said, "No Dianne, you cannot do that.  You have to sing the music like it's written."  And when she does her show at Symphony Center [Chicago, Illinois] or various shows periodically, she'll bring Miss Bennie, "Miss Bennie just got all on my case," she says, (laughter) "because I started ripping on it and she said, 'You cannot do that, you have to sing it the way it's written.  This is not jazz.'"  And she was very delightful.  But anyway, there are chapters, as I said, all over the country and we come together annually.  This past year, the souvenir booklet that I gave you is from the Norfolk convention that was just in July of this year and I hated to part with it (laughter) but I think my husband [George Williams] has his copy, so I'll have that one, but I did want you to have it for, just for background information because it has some history about the organization in it.
Story_ID: 361045
Speaker 1: You were telling me off camera, I think, about the, about you trying to gather materials to give to the Woodson Regional Library [Carter G. Woodson Regional Library, Chicago, Illinois] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh yes.
Speaker 1: --the Harsh Collection [Vivian G. Harsh Research Collection], and to the Society for Black Music Research [sic. Center for Black Music Research] and, at Columbia College [Columbia College Chicago, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 2: Yes, that's true.  The way I came in possession of these documents, well I don't have that many of them now, but the previous president of Chicago Music Association was Theodore Charles Stone, and he was the music critic for the Chicago Crusader.  Originally, he was the music critic for the Chicago Defender, but they went on strike back in 1960, for more wages and instead of settling with them in 1960, the Defender hired other people in their position, and [HistoryMaker] Earl Calloway became music critic of the Chicago Defender, and then Stone moved to the Chicago Crusader then as music critic for it.  He was president of Chicago Music Association from 1954 until 1996, which was forty-two years.  At the time that--he was born in 1912--at the time that he retired from the presidency of Chicago Music Association, he had some health problems and I was scholarship chair at that time under his administration, and I was nominated to succeed him as president in 1996, because he could no longer serve.  That's how I happened to become president of Chicago Music Association with Theodore Stone.  I eventually became his, not caretaker but just because of the relationship of his being president, he was eighty some odd years old at that time, I and several other members, he was a bachelor.  He had no children, was married only for a brief time, and there's a story behind him too, but I just assumed some responsibilities for him and took him around for his doctor's appointments and the like, and at that time he needed, it appeared that he was going to need more care.  He could not live independently any longer, so he gathered together about twenty-one cartons of his papers and music and stuff, and he donated it to the Center for Black Music Research.  At the time that he died, he had not given all of it away, and at the time that he died on October 17, 1998, he left me as custodian of the papers that he had left, and I went through quite a few of them, and donated some more of them to the Center for Black Music Research, and others to the Harsh Collection at the Woodson Library, and so both of them are repositories for Chicago Music Associations papers.  At the time that I made the donations to the Harsh, Mr. Miller [Robert Miller] and Mr. Flug [Michael Flug] told me that they had space at the center for NANMs [National Association of Negro Musicians] papers and materials if the National Association, we call it NANM, N-A-N-M, cared to contribute them, and so I think the president of NANM, now Roland Carter, who is at the University of Tennessee in Chattanooga [University of Tennessee at Chattanooga, Chattanooga, Tennessee], contacted me just recently to get the contact information because he wants to get those materials into the archives.  At any rate, that's the story of how I became president of Chicago Music Association, and how I made those and why I made those contributions.
Story_ID: 361046
Speaker 1: Dr. Stone [Theodore Charles Stone] had an, an, what should I say, a career really that was so interesting.  He never made it nationally.  He was a baritone.  He was singer.  He was a native of Gainesville, Texas, and when NANM [National Association of Negro Musicians] went to Fort Worth, Texas, he must have been twenty years old, so that would have been 1932, because he was born in 1912, 1932, they staged a Mile of Music parade, NANM members, musicians, and the like, and Theodore Charles Stone was on that parade route.  He, in Gainesville, Texas, had been raised by his grandmother [Mary Houston] and he went to high school there and he worked for a German woman [Otto Vaeth] who found out his interest in music and she gave him piano lessons and music lessons. He attended Houston-Tillotson College [Samuel Huston College; Houston-Tillotson University, Austin, Texas] and graduated from there, actually.  It was Sam Houston College at that time, but Houston-Tillotson now, and he came to Chicago [Illinois] to attend Chicago Musical College, which is the Chica- CCPA Roosevelt University [Roosevelt University Chicago College of Performing Arts, Chicago, Illinois] now, College of Performing Arts, Chicago College of Performing Arts, but its forerunner was Chicago Musical College.  While here, Marian Anderson came to town, Kosti Vehanen heard him sing, and invited him to, rather offered him a scholarship to Sibelius Institute [Sibelius Academy] in Helsinki, Finland, making him the first black student at Helsinki Institute, Sibelius Institute, rather, in Helsinki.  A group of ministers got together and raised up funds for him to go.  He went and this was in, like 1934, 1935, or 1936, and the outbreak of war [World War II, WWII] in Europe ended his career in Finland and he had to come back to the United States.  When he came back, he reunited himself with National Association of Negro Musicians and ultimately became president of Chicago Music Association.  Members of Chicago Music Association in those days were Florence V. Price, whose symphony was played by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, first black composer to be played by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra.
Speaker 2: About when was that? When did they do that (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) In 19- for the Columbian Exposition, I'm sorry, for the Century of Progress [Chicago World's Fair, A Century of Progress International Exposition, Chicago, Illinois], in 1933.
Speaker 2: In 1933?
Speaker 1: In 1933, except that going through the ledger, I discovered that Chicago Music Association raised the funds to pay Frederick Stock for the orchestra to play it.  It was not played by the choice of the symphony, and the symphony doesn't tell that, but I've got it in documentation, because I've got the ledgers from 1936 through, '35 [1935] probably through '38 [1938], how they wrote in these big, thick books, you know, and the minutes of every meeting and it's documented in there.  Margaret Bonds was also, and she's a very fabulous musician.  Gertrude Jackson Taylor, [HistoryMaker] Regina Harris Baiocchi did a study on Gertrude.  And her daughter Betty Jackson King, and I performed on one of the American Women Composers' concerts [International Alliance for Women in Music] singing music by Betty that she had written and dedicated to me on one of Regina's programs back a few years ago, in the '90s [1990s] anyway and it was before 19-, it was about 1993 or 1994, it was after Betty's death and before Betty's mother's death.  They died a year-and-a-half apart, so it must have been the fall of 1994 or the spring of 1995 that Regina put this on.  So we've collaborated on projects as well, and we stayed in touch with one another as well.  I've gotten off ground now, so you need to steer me back on.

Speaker 1: Blacks have composed music throughout the classical history, classical period, at the time that Bach [Johann Sebastian Bach] and Handel [George Frideric Handel] were composing music. Palestrina [Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina], the 17th century composers Meude-Monpas [Chevalier J.J.O. de Meude-Monpas], Rachel Barton Pine has discovered music by him for violin and she is playing that kind of music, playing that music so people can hear the beauty of it.
Speaker 2: And you mentioned (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) The Chevalier de St-Georges [Joseph Boulogne Chevalier de St-Georges], who also was a composer in the 17th century.  We've had composers throughout the classical period, the romantic period and the like.  You know--
Speaker 2: And we mentioned off camera, well, who is the English--
Speaker 1: Coleridge-Taylor.
Speaker 2: Samuel Coleridge-Taylor.
Speaker 1: Samuel Coleridge-Taylor, Samuel Coleridge-Taylor, for whom Coleridge-Taylor Perkinson was named, a very dear friend that passed away several years ago.
Speaker 2: We mentioned off camera the dilemma of Scott Joplin.
Speaker 1: Scott Joplin, who--
Speaker 2: The composer, played popular music but composed operas too.
Speaker 1: Composed opera, 'Treemonisha' [Scott Joplin], composed operas and wanted to, he aspired to perform that level of music that he had created, not that there's anything wrong with rag [ragtime] or the type of music that he was most known for, but as an artist, you explore the entire realm of your ability and you want to do that.  That's what you want to do, to perform that which you create.  You don't want to be pigeon-holed.  That's why Duke [Duke Ellington] refused to, refused to say that this is jazz, this is classical, this is sacred.  There are two kinds of music.  Music is beyond category, and that's an expression that he used all the time, beyond category.
Speaker 2: Stories of Will Marion Cook.
Speaker 1: Certainly.
Speaker 2: William Grant Still and others, there you see the swing between the popular and the classical and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And certainly.  And Will Marion Cook actually, he and Harry T. Burleigh, were the ones who took Dvorak [Antonin Dvorak] by hand when he came to head the National Conservatory [National Conservatory of Music of America] in New York City [New York, New York], which is now Juilliard [The Juilliard School, New York, New York]. But, the National Conservatory, headed by Mrs. Thurber, Jeannette Thurber, back in the late 1890s. Harry Burleigh and Will Marion Cook and Will Vodery, V-O-D-E-R-Y, were students at the conservatory.  Dvorak came here to study American music.  He wanted to see what it was all about, came from Czechoslovakia, and he heard the spirituals that Burleigh had arranged and was so taken aback with his mastery of musicianship and creating chords and chord progressions that he would sit with them in the dorm and listen to them play and sing, and when he created, composed his 'New World' ['From the New World'] symphony, 'Symphony Number 9' [Antonin Dvorak], that was inspired by Harry T. Burleigh and Will Marion Cook, who incidentally, (laughter) here we go, who incidentally were colleagues of Henry L. Grant, who was Duke Ellington's teacher, and that's the connection between Dvorak and Ellington.  Will Marion Cook used to confer with Duke Ellington, Vodery and Will Marion Cook, and you can read it in 'Music Is My Mistress' [Duke Ellington], Duke's autobiography.  He told about the people who influenced him in music and his compositional style and Will Marion Cook used to tell him, "You don't need to ask me anything because you're gonna do it your way anyway."  (Laughter) "You don't do what I say to do."

Speaker 1: Was William Grant Still related to Henry Grant [Henry L. Grant]?
Speaker 2: No, not to my knowledge, he wasn't.  Do you know Judith Anne, Judith Anne Still is William Grant Still's daughter by Verner Avery [ph.], and Verner Avery might have been his second wife.  That was an interracial marriage as I remember, and she has studio, she has the publishing company.  She is located in Flagstaff, Arizona.  She is keeping her father's music alive.
Speaker 1: I heard that a lot of his music was used on radio programs in the 1930s or '40s [1940s] or whatever.
Speaker 2: 'Afro-American Symphony' ['Symphony No. 1,' William Grant Still] was one of the most famous ones that he composed and it's the one that has the most exposure, but he was a dean of American composers.  He probably has composed more music than a lot of them combined, but for the very reason that the National Association of Negro Musicians [NANM] and Chicago Music Association came into being is the reason that his music is not played and is not prolific around the world. The same reasons.  It's not that it's not good music.  It has been pushed aside, Rachel's [Rachel Barton Pine] terminology, it's been marginalized, and it is, the world is denied the beauty of this music of black composers.  I keep, I say black.  I refuse to use African American, because it's too loose.  Here I go digressing again (laughter), but a person from Morocco, if they come to the United States and become a citizen, what are they?  They're an African American.  Algeria, Tunisia, it does not refer to the blacks in Africa.  It refers to anyone from the African continent.  People got angry during the last presidential election, because Teresa Heinz Kerry, who was born in Madagascar, which is Africa, said, "I am an African American.  I'm an American of African descent."  "How dare she call herself an African American?  She's not African American," but she is.  She's an African who came to the United States, became a citizen, what does that make her?  So, I use black because it's universal, it does not need any description.  It can be a Frenchman, it can be a Canadian, it's the race.

Speaker 1: We asked [HistoryMaker] Charles Burrell of the Denver Symphony [Denver Symphony Orchestra] about this, because he plays jazz and he also plays, sang bass in the Denver Symphony Orchestra, about the two forms and he says he performs well in either form, he said, but he said they're different, and he said the classical genre is, you have a master and you have, every note is written down and you're supposed to play it according to the way it's written (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's right.
Speaker 1: And if you don't you're in big trouble and it's more like a dictatorship and it's more of a right-wing form, we were saying, of music.
Speaker 2: That's what a jazz person would say (laughter).
Speaker 1: And he said likewise, when you look at the composition of a symphony, I mean they're very, it's hard for blacks to get involved in that kind of music.  I mean, they don't let you in, first of all.  It's hard for them to get in.
Speaker 2: That's why they don't go, that's why we don't go into it; because they don't let us in.  It's so hard to get into it and its long-time endemic systemic, what shall I say, I mean, do I need to say any more--
Speaker 1: This is where you can check out jazz, though. You've got people, they can, they can compose as they go along--
Speaker 2: Because we developed jazz.
Speaker 1: They can add, even the guys in the audience, they come and sit in.  Now, if he doesn't play right people won't like it.  He'll probably get down and sit back down again, but it's more, it's improvisational and free.
Speaker 2: But it's because we invented that art form.  We invented that art form so we were the masters of it, and others learned it from us, and they've taken it from that point and moved beyond.  The classical music, perhaps, we learned it from the European standard and, as American composers, it's based on the European standard so we did not create that, so therefore we are not considered the masters of it.  We're not considered the masters of it--doesn't mean that we don't master it.
Speaker 1: Some have certainly mastered it.
Speaker 2: Of course, many have mastered it and they're marginalized.  We're back to that.  But, you can't deny the fact that gospel came out of blues, and jazz came out of, what?
Speaker 1: Jazz came out of blues?
Speaker 2: Came out of religious music, blues, yes.
Speaker 1: Blues and gospel, yes.
Speaker 2: Yes, they're all related, and that's why, George Gershwin, great jazz master, 'Porgy and Bess' [George Gershwin].  What is that based on?  The black experience.  Not the Appalachian experience, the black experience, and he heard this music.  He was a classically trained musician, but he heard this music and he loved it.  He loved that expression, and his classical music has the elements of jazz in it.  Has that same, but it's written down and it's played exactly the way it is written, but in jazz, jazz is creative.  It's not static.  It's creative, and as you play you have charts and you have notes there, but you, in jazz you improvise from those notes and go beyond what the composer has put down and it's expected to do that.  It's like with singing gospel.  The basic notes are there, but you hear all these extra notes that people put on, and singing Ellington [Duke Ellington]; melisma, it's called, whenever you, in vocal music it's melisma, M-E-L-I-S-M-A, when you improvise on a melody and you add extra notes into it.

Speaker 1: Now, do you have a favorite piece of music that you like to perform yourself, or like to hear?  What's your favorite music?  I mean, or your favorite piece of music?
Speaker 2: It's hard to say.  There are so many that are so special to me.  The compositions of my friend, Betty Jackson King, are really very special to me.  She wrote a piece and dedicated it to me, entitled 'In the Springtime' [Betty Jackson King].  It's taken from Shakespeare [William Shakespeare].  "In the springtime," I can't remember all of a sudden, it's not 'Midsummer Night's Dream' ['A Midsummer Night's Dream,' William Shakespeare], 'As You Like It' [William Shakespeare]?  Oh, goodness.  That's terrible for an English literature major (laughter).  I can't even remember which one it was.  But, "In the springtime, the pretty ring time when birds do sing, hey ding-a-ding ding, sweet lovers love the spring."  That is, it's from a Shakespearian play, and I'm glad Betty's not here (laughter), and she's passed away twelve years ago so she can't reprimand me for not knowing the quotation (laughter).  I think it's from 'As You Like It,' but I'm not sure.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I, I love organ music.  This would be surprising to you, but my current husband is an organist and he and I were classmates in college when I went back to school, and he married one of my friend's colleagues from Teachers College [Chicago Teachers College; Chicago State University, Chicago, Illinois], and I was already married, so the four of us were friends and my current husband, George Williams, hired me and my husband [Harry Pryor II], who was a tenor, to sing oratorios in various concerts with him throughout the years.  Well, my husband died in 1984, and we attended concerts together, the four of us, opera, Lyric Opera [Lyric Opera of Chicago], together, and my husband died in 1984.  Annabel [Annabel Williams (ph.)], who was George's wife, died in 1981, and there were the two of us left, and he proposed.  "Let's get married."  So, it was a continuation of a friendship of forty years or so, and we married one another, and I said all of that because I said he was studying organ when we were in college, and he taught with City Colleges of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois] for thirty-six years, Harold Washington College [Chicago, Illinois] downtown, taught music theory, piano, and voice, and he's been organist, choirmaster at the Northfield Community Church [Northfield, Illinois] since 1967.  We worked together right after I finished college in 1961.  I was his children's choir director and alto soloist at St. James United Methodist Church [Chicago, Illinois], where he was minister of music at that time, and so the association has been a long-time friendship.  Now, I said about organ music, I love the music of Viernes [Louis Vierne] and Cesar Franck, and various organ, I guess the organ is my favorite instrument next to voice.  I like some of the vocal works of Bach [Johann Sebastian Bach].  I love the spirituals.  I love the arrangements of Burleigh [Harry T. Burleigh], Boatner [Edward Boatner], of Rollo Dilworth, who is a current young composer in his thirties, trained at Northwestern [Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois].  He got his doctorate and he's teaching at North Park College [sic. North Park University, Chicago, Illinois] now.  Robert Morris, the one that I mentioned who did the Duke, Duke Ellington, he's written music, written something and dedicated it to me, as has Rollo.  There are so many wonderful composers, but I love the music of black people.  I love my music.  I love the music of my composers in addition to the European masters and the American masters.

Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns for the black community today?
Speaker 2: Some of my hopes and concerns are that I wish that we could reconnect ourselves as family units and become more, in, for lack of a better term, in control of our children so that they are directed in paths that are positive and not self-destructive, so that they can learn the beauty of relationships, relationships that are creative and not detrimental to themselves so that they can appreciate the beauty in their surroundings, the beauty of music, whatever type music you like, art, culture, to reconnect with a religious base, I won't, churches, synagogues. Well, I'll say churches because there are very, very few black Jews, but they do exist, and those who do exist are still connected in that manner, I think.  To redirect ourselves and get out of this self-destructive pattern that we see going on in life. You know, babies having babies and not being able to prepare that child with the necessary tools for creative living, for creative life.  If the world is not better off because you lived, then your life has been in vain.  You've been not a contributor.  You know, because I've been here something should be better.  That's what I was always taught.  That's what life is about, and what you are doing, and what he's doing, this is creativity, and it's doing something to better life on earth, and if the world is worse off because you've been here, then your life is negative and was not worth it.

Speaker 1: When you look back at everything that you've done up to this point, is there any major thing that you would do differently now if you had to do it again?
Speaker 2: I've, that's a rhetorical question (laughter) and as a person who sometimes engages in rhetoric, you've got about ninety-eight pages there (laughter).  I would say this.  As a student of logics and social science, I would not have done anything different because I would have still been that same person at that time and place when I made that decision, and that's the only thing I could do.  As I look back, if I had more knowledge, if I had the knowledge that I have now, if I had that at age twenty, maybe I would have done something different, but I'm, I would be that same person with that same experience base, experiential base at that point in time, so I could only have made that decision, so my life would have played out exactly as it did.
Story_ID: 351854
Speaker 1: Also, if you look back at everything you've done up to this point, what would you consider today at this moment to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: Hopefully that I've been able to provide some guidance and leadership to young artists who are coming along now when there are more opportunities available for them in the performance arena.  As Chicago Music Association, we present young artists in concert, young artists at various levels of their growth.  We present children.  We try to inspire them into the cultural arts, and that type of thing, so I would hope that because in a way to illustrate it, we've pounded on the door until out knuckles were bloody.  I hope that now that the doors are opening, those who are coming behind us could enter them.

Speaker 1: Now you've talked about your family, your, you don't have any children, yes you do have children, yes you do (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, I have, my son passed away suddenly four years ago. In fact, four months before I married Mr. Williams [George Williams], and my husband [Harry Pryor II] had a daughter, my first husband had a daughter by a previous marriage that I raised, and so she's in Atlanta [Georgia].  She's a grandmother now and she was, she's close to me in age, actually.  I think I'm like fifteen years older than she is, but at the time that we married she was four years, five years old, four years old, and she and my son grew up together.  She, we had custody of her until she was twenty years old, and then she got married, and my husband, current husband, had a set of twins by his previous wife [Annabel Williams (ph.)].  They're adults as well, and so those are the children that I have.
Story_ID: 351856
Speaker 1: I also have children that I call my children, former students.  One of them, Dr. William Hallman [ph.], who is a gastroenterologist right now, in Racine, Wisconsin, was my seventh and eighth grade student, and at the time that I was teaching in the classroom at that, at George Donoghue School [George T. Donoghue Elementary School; University of Chicago Charter-Donoghue Campus, Chicago, Illinois] at 37th [Street] and Cottage Grove [Avenue], we, there was a program called operation, or Project Wingspread, and it was an attempt to expose inner city youth to suburban youth and to attending, having a school experience in a suburban area, so we commuted daily from the inner city, thirty children from my school, to Skokie [Illinois], where I taught in a position, the position of a teacher who also brought thirty children from her school to the inner city and taught in my classroom.  It was a way of creating understanding and friendships among children of different races in order to solve some of the problems of the times.  Now, this was 1969, so you know what was going at that time; the civil rights demonstrations and 1968 riots here in Chicago [Illinois], the Democratic National Convention and all of that was going on during their time in elementary school.  They were sixth graders and Wingspread started in '69 [1969], this group.  It went for two years, until Nixon [President Richard Milhous Nixon] didn't re-fund it.  Am I correct?  Nixon, yes.  At any rate, this young man, William Hallman, who was a seventh and eighth grade student, always wanted to be a doctor but he was a little kid, a black kid from South Side [Chicago, Illinois] in the projects and he couldn't do that.  When he got out there into Skokie and in the experiences that we provided for them and with my, constantly reiterating what I told you.  You asked me what was my philosophy, you can do anything you want to do.  You just have to work for it.  He became convinced I can be a doctor.  She's told me.  She believes in me.  I can be a doctor.  I may be a little poor black kid from 40th Street and Vincennes [Avenue] in Chicago, but I can do it.  He graduated from Donoghue School in 1971, and he went to Lindblom Tech [Robert Lindblom Technical High School; Lindblom Math and Science Academy, Chicago, Illinois].  From there, he went to Bradley [Bradley University] in Peoria [Illinois], won a scholarship to the University of Pittsburgh medical school [University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania] and started his medical training.  Well, I told you that I was a social service, social science teacher and he waited until he got into medical school to become an activist, meaning speaking out against the unjustness in medical schools and the discrimination against black students in medical school.  And one night, I got a phone call.  He was gonna be kicked out of, he knew he was in trouble.  He had been engaged in activism among the black students (laughter) and this professor was out to get him.  "What am I gonna do?"  I said, "You chose the wrong time to open up your mouth (laughter), for one thing."  I said, "It's one thing to be an activist, but you can't, unless you're willing to make the sacrifice, and this is going to dash every hope you ever had."  "Well, what can I do?"  Well, we talked and talked and talked and I said, "Is it too late to withdraw from, from the school without getting a grade?"  He said, "No."  I said, "Withdraw." Withdraw from classes because now you don't have to be with, at a certain point it's withdraw and passing, withdraw and failing.  It had just begun he could withdraw.  There was no negative record on his--so he did.  I said, "You withdraw from medical school, go to Carnegie Mellon [Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania], get your master's degree in public health, and by that time it should have blown over and then you go back to Pitt medical school," and that's what he did.  In 1985, about February, my doorbell rang and here he stood on the front porch with a cup in his hand that said Student Medical Society, University of Pittsburgh medical school.  He said, "Here, it's yours.  If it hadn't been for you, I would never--." He was elected president of the Student Medical Society.  He graduated in May 1985.  I went to the graduation, sang for his wedding, and today he is a gastroenterologist in Racine, Wisconsin, All Saints Medical Center, Hospital and Medical Center [All Saints Hospital, Racine, Wisconsin], and he says, "If it hadn't been for you, I wouldn't be this."  I said, "Unh-uh.  If it hadn't been for you, you wouldn't be this.  You're the one who did the work.  I didn't do the work.  You are the one who's qualified to be the doctor.  I'm not the doctor.  You are.  All I did was to open to you what your possibilities and your potential was."

Speaker 1: We always ask this question.  It's similar to legacy but not quite the same thing, but it's the last question we ask.  How would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: I would like to be remembered as someone who appreciates the beauty in life, the beauty in cultural events, and especially the beauty of music, because music has that ability to unite people universally.  You don't have to speak the same language in order to enjoy the same music.
Speaker 1: Okay. Well, thank you very much (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You're welcome.
Speaker 1: Pleasure to meet you.
Speaker 2: It's a pleasure to meet you too.
Speaker 1: Okay.
