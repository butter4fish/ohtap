Speaker 1: Now let's talk a little bit about your mother, starting with her name and where she was born and what you know about her background.
Speaker 2: Okay, well my mother's name, course maiden name was Brown, but it's Bernice Baker, and she was born in Augusta, Georgia, I think about 1915, 1916, yeah, and she grew up in Georgia and then moved to Washington D.C., back, I believe, in the '30s [1930s] or the '40s [1940s].  And what I do remember she always owned property, she always owned a house even before she was married, and in 1949 I believe it was, at least it may have been when I was born or shortly thereafter, she and my father [Oscar Baker] adopted my brother [HistoryMaker] Donald [Baker] and I and gave us a loving home, and she was just a wonderful woman.  You know as a matter of fact she got me started on my path to photography.
Speaker 1: And how would you describe your mother?
Speaker 2: She is independent, an entrepreneur.  She didn't do any complaining.  She always did what had to be done, and she never made us feel as if we didn't have anything, I mean, she always provided, at her own peril I would say, but she was committed to her family.
Speaker 1: And can you tell us the story of how she and your father came to adopt you and your brother?
Speaker 2: Well, she realized she couldn't have children early, I guess in her adulthood, because she had suffered an accident when she was growing up.  So, she came to the adoption agency, as she told my brother and I, and she said when she passed our crib she said these two little boys just reached their arms up at her, and she just knew that they were the ones that she was supposed to adopt.  And I guess they made the arrangements and we had a home.
Speaker 1: And how old were you all?
Speaker 2: I would have to say that we couldn't have been more, I really don't know for certain, but I don't think we were more than six months to a year old when that happened.
Speaker 1: And did your mother ever share any stories with you about her growing up and what life was like for her growing up?
Speaker 2: No, we didn't really know a whole lot about her growing up.  I mean, the most we knew is that, you know, she had suffered an accident riding a bike, you know, which ultimately resulted in her not being able to have children and that's really all we know.  We never really discussed that, but then that generation generally didn't talk too much about those kind of things, you know, I mean you pretty much knew what your parents were about based on how they dealt with you at that time.  And there wasn't a whole lot of history discussed.
Story_ID: 192114
Speaker 1: Let's talk a little bit about your father now, starting with his name and where he was born and that kind of thing.
Speaker 2: Okay, my father's name was Oscar Gilbert Baker, and he was born in Alexandria, Virginia, I think about 1917, and my father was a good looking man.  I'd say he was a player.  I confirmed that he definitely was a player, and he always you know wore nice suits, always wore nice, nice double-breasted suits, you know.  He also was an entrepreneur.  He was a watch- he did watch repair, but he also worked for the government.  He worked at the government printing office and then in 1960 he was--he took on a position as a supervisor in the main post office on Capitol Street.  I believe he was the first black supervisor in that, in the [U.S.] Post Office in that department anyway, and so basically he did entrepreneur work as well as worked in the government and he retired because of health reasons back in the mid '60s [1960s] and died in July of '69 [1969].
Speaker 1: And who would you describe your father?
Speaker 2: Well, he was energetic.  He was a people person, pretty much like myself.  He was outgoing.  You know he definitely had a straight eye for the ladies (laughter), pretty similar to me except for he strayed a bit unlike myself, but he was good.  He was good with my brother [HistoryMaker Donald Baker] and I.  He was a disciplinarian, but he was, you know, real fair, and he taught us a lot, you know, in how to basically be an entrepreneur and how to be committed to something and sticking with it.
Speaker 1: And did he ever any share any stories with you about his growing up--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --and what life was like for him growing up?
Speaker 2: No, it was never any kind of discussions like that and when I look back on it, it is kind of strange, but a lot of our friends don't know a whole lot about their parents, you know, it's just something they didn't really talk about with us.
Speaker 1: Now, there was something you had mentioned before about your father that was kind of interesting in his workshop.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, he used to keep this jar and, and it was like a pickle jar and he kept, apparently he had an accident and cut off the tip of his baby finger, I think it was, and he used to keep that in the jar as a reminder to whatever it is that he did to cause that to happen, not to do that again.  We kind of thought it was kind of crazy though 'cause every time we'd go down to the basement to his work bench here's this, this piece of finger floating in a jar, which, it was just strange, but, you know, I guess for us it became a normal thing, but something we didn't necessary share with the kids in the neighborhood.
Speaker 1: And did he ever discuss what happened?
Speaker 2: Nope, never knew how he lost it, so we don't know if he lost it, you know, I don't know he could have been jumping out the window of somebody's house or something for all we know and the window came down on his hand.  I don't know.  I'm assuming he did it in a work bench related situation, but with my father you could never tell.
Speaker 1: And how far back can you trace your ancestors?  Do you know if you all came from free people, slaves, in terms of your adopted family?
Speaker 2: Well, far as I can recall, my grandmother's father's name was Hunter Daniels and I believe that he, he may or may not, he probably was a freed slave, 'cause my grandmother was born in 1884, so I'd have to believe that her father had to have been a slave.  Or even if he was a teenager when he had her that would have had to have been shortly thereafter.  So, he was probably somewhere in that neighborhood, and they were born in South Carolina as far as I know and, and of course my grandmother I think was born there as well and that's pretty far, as far back as I can recall as far as that's concerned.
Speaker 1: How did your parents meet?
Speaker 2: I have no idea.  I--you know in all honesty knowing my mother [Bernice Brown Baker] and father they probably met, probably met on the job or something, or at a club 'cause my mother liked to party too and so I really don't know how they met.  It's so funny, because there are things that you'd almost think, I talk about all the time with people on how I met my wife [Imogene Baker], but it's--and my daughter [Kellee Baker] knows, you know, but it's something our parents never really talked about--
Story_ID: 192115
Speaker 1: Let's talk a little bit about your grandparents, starting with your maternal grandparents, with their names and what you can tell us about them.
Speaker 2: Okay, I never knew my grandfather, 'cause he had passed before we were adopted.  My grandmother was named Sarah Fagins and--
Speaker 1: Could you spell Fagins?
Speaker 2: F-A-G-I-N-S.  And as far as I could tell, when we were growing up--she always lived with us, and when we were growing up she was a typical grandmother.  She was a very stately looking woman.  She had long gray hair, you know, just like a grandmother really, but she still was young looking for a grandmother I thought.  But, grandmothers during those days had gray hair and now they're like in their 30s, you know, so it is a difference I guess after a few generations.  But, she was a disciplinarian, you know, and she, she could command you to go out to the tree and get that switch and you'd find yourself trying to find the smallest switch, and she'd go out and get the tree trunk, so you didn't wanna cross her, you know, when it came time for the disciplinarian type of a situation.  But, she was always sweet to us.  I think she kind of spoiled us a little bit, you know, and she always gave us that extra feeling of security.  You know when we came home from school, there was always lunch or you know snacks or something prepared for us.
Speaker 1: And what about your grandparents on your father's [Oscar Baker] side, your paternal grandparents?
Speaker 2: We had met my father's mother.  Her name was Alice and then there was her, their grandmother.  I think we may have a picture of her, but I don't really know what her name was.  I probably have to check with my aunt who is the only surviving member on our side of the family, my father's sister, Louise Chandler Baker.  And she, as far as the father was concerned, the grandfather, I don't know--they never talked about him, so I don't know what the situation was with my father's father.  But basically we had met his aunt and his mother and grandmother, and that was probably back in the '50s [1950s] and they probably passed not much, much probably into the late '50s [1950s] or early '60s [1960s] they had already passed on.
Story_ID: 192116
Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] Mr. [Ronald Gilbert] Baker, if you will, tell us what your earliest memory of growing up is?  What's your earliest memory?
Speaker 2: I think my earliest memory of growing up probably was back in the early '50s [1950s].  Our parents [Oscar Baker and Bernice Brown Baker] used to, at least my mother, used to dress my brother [HistoryMaker Donald Baker] and I alike, so we had these little cute little white caps on and white suits with you know the shorts and you know I guess we were paraded out, you know, amongst the people 'cause being twins it's a rarity back then.  There were no, there were no fertility pills or anything like that, so if you were a twin you were, especially an identical twin, you know that was really a spectacle at that point.  You know you're like probably two or three dollars from being in the circus and so you get out there and we remember all of the attention that we got from people, you know, saying that we're twins and we used to play, I remember we used to play out in the yard 'cause my brother and I played a lot together 'cause we always had each other, so we'd play out in the yard and I think we had a dog.  You know somehow I don't remember the dog living, but we have pictures with a dog in it, so I'm assuming it was our dog.  It might have been the neighbor's dog for all I know, but I assume it was our dog.  I don't know its name.  It was black and it looked like a schnauzer or something.  I don't know, his name was Spot or something like that, you know, but King, you know black neighborhoods and the dog is always named King, King or Prince or something or Queen, Queenie, there's always a Queenie in there.  But, it was kind of funny because I'd never remembered interacting with the dog, so I guess I'm just assuming it was a neighbor's dog, you know, but we, we used to have a lot of neighbors up and down the street that we played with and it was always enjoyable because it was a community where everybody knew everybody.  The parents knew who all the kids were and so you couldn't go anywhere in that block without being monitored by an adult, you know, and it was almost critical that you don't do anything that could cause you to be, I think, disciplined either by the neighbor or have a phone call made ahead of you getting home and being disciplined by the people at home or being disciplined by both.  You know, I mean, that's the kind of community we grew up in, which was a good community.
Story_ID: 192117
Speaker 1: Can you kind of describe your block [in Washington, D.C.] for us a little bit, just visually describe it for us?
Speaker 2: Well, it was a middle-class neighborhood, of course, we didn't know that then.  You know, we thought we were living high on the hog.  It was a middle-class neighborhood, which was pretty good for the community back then and it was integrated, you know, which we didn't know was a rarity as well because there were whites and other nationalities in the community back then and they were all semi-detached brick homes, you know, well-manicured lawns and shrubbery and stuff.  It was real nice, real nice home.  Most of the people lived in the neighborhood were either government workers or they were teachers.  I think we had a couple of doctors and lawyers that lived there, so it was pretty--a middle-class neighborhood.
Speaker 1: And can you just share some stories of growing up with us?
Speaker 2: I don't know, in that neighborhood we used to, I do remember every time I go over there now, the smell of sand, you know play box sand, always bring back those memories of growing up.  You know, there's always something that you do, or that you experience growing up that a smell or a sight or something brings back those memories and we used to have neighbors that we played with who had sandboxes and swings and stuff like that, so it was a lot of that.  We used--there was always the old ice cream truck, you know, and of course when you hear that coming you'd start running because it was critical, you know, that you got your ice cream.  And I remember one day we had, the ice cream truck came and one, two of our neighbors, brother and sister, Bobby and Alvarette [ph.] Spielman [ph.], they ran out into the street in between two cars and out into the street, to the street to get to the ice cream truck and got hit by a car, both of them, and it was the scariest thing.  They weren't injured bad, just kind of scuffed up, but it taught me a lesson about running after the ice cream truck, and so I didn't stop liking ice cream as a result of that experience, but I learned you don't run from in between cars out to the street.  And so it was a valuable lesson, and so that's one of those lessons you got that was involuntary, but very valuable.  We played the usual, you know, cowboys and Indians kind of stuff.  We didn't know any better.  We didn't realize we weren't either, you know, but growing up then we liked that.  We also grew up looking at like 'The Ed Sullivan Show,' and it was, I think I can, I think it was like, I remember I think '55 [1955] or '56 [1956] Elvis Presley came on and we had neighbors, we had some neighbors who somehow were related to the Everly Brothers or something and they came on 'The Ed Sullivan Show' and everybody was notified, you gotta look at 'The Ed Sullivan Show.'  And so anytime anybody like Little Richard or anybody black was on there you know we were always looking at it, 'cause there wasn't that much going on as far as black entertainers were in the '50s [1950s].  You might get Little Richard.  You might get Nat King Cole, or maybe you'd get some other artists, but as far as rock and roll, no, pretty much it was kind of limited to the Elvis Presley or Roy Orbison or you know some of the more rock or pop groups other than Elvis Presley.  So a lot of things centered around television.  We remember, I remember growing up looking at 'Amos 'n' Andy.'  I thought 'Amos 'n' Andy' was hilarious because I knew some of those characters, you know.  My father [Oscar Baker] belonged to the Masons, and I didn't know much about the Masons.  I knew they were some kind of club, you know, and I noticed they didn't discuss too much of anything, so whatever they were doing I never knew what it was, never got enough interest to join it, but I could always imagine my father's associates and their club, this organization, of Masons with the, I forget the name, the knights of something on 'Amos 'n' Andy,' but I know looking at that, it was a bad time for that show because the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] felt that it was degrading to black image.  And technically it was, but you know sometimes the black image is degrading to the black image, so in all reality back then we just saw it as humorous, you know, because Andy was always being taken by "Kingfish," you know, and "Kingfish" was always scheming.  I mean, he was an entrepreneur's entrepreneur.  He never really made any money, but he always had an idea and always had a scheme, you know, but he was always cheating the same old people, the people he knew who didn't have any more than he had, so I figured wasn't that bright, you know, but he had this, I imagine you'd say loving wife, although we grew up with the understanding that if you had a wife and they called her a sapphire, that was not a good thing, 'cause apparently that meant she was a nagging kind of you know testing kind of person that you probably didn't want to be involved with.  So, black women took an offense to being called sapphire.  I understood later in years why that was the case.  And so, but we loved 'Amos 'n' Andy' and of course when they went off the air it was like the only black show that was on in the '50s [1950s], so when you looked at it from the perspective of the groundbreaking, somebody had to do that type of stuff so that the shows that would come on later like 'Julia' and 'The Mod Squad' and shows that came on in the '60s [1960s] would not have had a chance if it wasn't for 'Amos 'n' Andy.'  So, 'Amos 'n' Andy' really was not a bad show, and when I look at old DVDs of them now, those shows were really funny and they really, a lot of them really did make sense it's just at the time we wanted, I think black people wanted to be viewed differently because it was always only one way that we were being seen.  And growing up, I understood that, you know, so it--but those were good memories though for me growing up back there in the '50s [1950s].
Story_ID: 192118
Speaker 1: You told me a story once about when you were a small boy and you were gonna help your neighbor's hair grow.  Was that you?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, yeah, that was--
Speaker 1: Can you share that story with us?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that was, yeah, that was interesting because I was--I can't, I still can't remember.  As a matter of fact, I was in my neighborhood a couple of weeks ago and I went by the house and I was trying to remember which house it was, but the exteriors have changed a little bit, but I remember being on the porch, a kind of enclosed screen porch, and one of the neighbor girls had pigtails or something like that, had a braid, and I told her I knew a way for her hair to get, you know, grow longer and down her back, but she had to close her eyes and turn around and just as I was getting ready to drop a silkworm down her back, her mother peeked out the door and said what are you doing, and I dropped it and took off.  Before I got home, you know, the word had gotten out that I had done something I wasn't supposed to do, so I met Mr. Strap, you know when I got in the house.  And of course I haven't dropped any silkworms down anybody, any girls' backs lately, but that was--I don't even know how I even thought of that, you know.  It was just something, I guess, boys do at that age.  I don't know if it's instinctive or it just comes with the DNA or what, but it was just something I thought I wouldn't have thought of doing that, you know; it just happened.
Story_ID: 192119
Speaker 1: Growing up, as you said, you know, twins, identical twins, were really a rarity.  Was it difficult for like the neighborhood kids and parents to tell you and your brother [HistoryMaker Donald Baker] apart?
Speaker 2: No, I think most--it's so funny because my brother and I had two different personalities.  I was pretty much an extrovert and he was pretty much an introvert and so he was much more serious.  I was much more outgoing, so people even to this day pretty much tell us apart by our personalities.  And so if we, if I approach you, then pretty much, you've gotta be Ronald you know, or, Donald doesn't tend to run to somebody arms open embracing and that kind of stuff.  He's not a hug person, so as a result I think that's how people tell us apart.  But, growing up I think it wasn't difficult, but it was challenging because people, you know once you are an identical twin people first of all always trying to figure out who's who and then people try to figure out well who can do what and who can't do what, you know, who's smarter, you know who can do this and that and so what you end up doing is what happened to us we ended up getting, developing a competitiveness between us that resulted in us always trying to outdo each other in whatever we did, and we still do that today, absolutely ridiculous but--
Speaker 1: So who is smarter?
Speaker 2: Well, I'm sure my brother would say I am, you know, but you know I wouldn't bet the house on that, you know, but I'm sure he'd realize that certainly, I'm the most mature.  But, I'd probably be challenged by his response to that either.  So, I would just say, I would say he'd say he was smarter, but I'd say we both know the truth.  So, we just pretty much leave that there.
Story_ID: 192120
Speaker 1: You mentioned earlier, we talked about what sights, sounds, and smells remind you of growing up.  Could you just tell us again, you talked a little bit about smells and sounds, and so what smells, sights and sounds?
Speaker 2: I remember, every time I see a weeping willow tree it reminds me of the big weeping willow tree we had in the backyard.  We had just a nice backyard.  We had so much fun playing around that tree and that was also the tree we had to usually pull a limb or something off of to help assist us in the, I guess the kids would call it brutality know by parents, but what we just call it a whooping.  And I remember the smell of honeysuckle, and honeysuckle, we had honeysuckle trees in the yard too and so that always reminded me of that, and then when I see houses with long stairwells up to, of course our house was, it was kind of funny it had the basement and then above on the next floor from the backyard there were long stairs that led up, so when I see a house with long stairs especially in the back it reminds me of the back of our house and how we used to play up and down those stairs.  I kind of wondered well, how did we ever avoid not falling off of those steps 'cause it was pretty high up, you know, but it was, it was always something nice about it and we always found something to play around that area.  I'm trying to think I also remem- I'm not big on cutting grass.  I'm not a yard person and I think part of that comes from when I was growing up I remember playing out in the yard and I think at that time I was playing by myself and I remember my neighbors, Mr. Lyon [ph.], across the street was cutting his grass and he had one of those--our house, on our side of the street, most of the houses were level, ground level, so you didn't have high steps to get to the house.  Across the street the majority of the houses had two to three levels of steps you had to go up to get to the house, because it was more on the higher part of the hill.  And so he was cutting his grass and I specifically remember him scream all of a sudden and then I looked up and apparently he had, his foot had slipped under the lawnmower and I don't know if he cut his toes off, but he damaged his foot pretty bad and all I remember is people running out of the house and wrapping his foot up in towels and him screaming and stuff like that.  And I remember growing up saying, "I never wanna cut grass."  I never wanna use an electric lawnmower or a power lawnmower, I mean, to this day I think of that.  Not every time I go out to cut the grass, 'cause usually by the time I even cut the grass it needs cutting.  You know the neighbors are like looking at it, you know, okay, let's cut the jungle scene, you know, but for me that was some experience.  So, anytime somebody is cutting grass on a hill I always remember that or when I cut grass on a hill I always get as far away from the lawnmower as I can get, you know, never afraid to bail out away from it if I push it and it slips or something like that you just never wanna go to that experience.  So, those, that's some of the things I remember and I remember riding in a car with my father [Oscar Baker], he and his buddies would load up on Saturday and they'd go wherever it is they go and if he took us along, you know, we'd be sitting in the car watching him and his buddies, and of course back then all the guys always smoked and it's something we never did.  But, they smoked and I guess they had their favorite beverage of choice, which was probably some kind of rotgut liquor.  They were probably drinking scotch or something, gin, whatever, they were drinking back in the days, and they, and that would be the Saturday excursion.  I'd hardly call that the kind of father and son outing that most people would kind of associate with parental involvement, but I guess that was, he was preparing us for well, this might be how you were living when you become an adult, so you might as well get acclimated to this now.  Now that I think about it, you know, that was abuse.  You know and I swore from when I was growing up that I'd never, 'cause I never saw any of those guys that rode with my father pass a dollar for gas and even at that young age I felt that somebody must be paying for, 'cause we're riding and we know we had to stop at a gas station, so I think during that time I always swore I would never have a bunch of people in my car and I never have.  I don't ride, I don't have a whole lot of friends that ride.  I have a lot of friends, but nobody that rides around in the car with me.  I don't allow it, I mean, I'm testy when my wife [Imogene Baker] is sitting in the car, you know, so I'm just funny like that.  You know, I just never wanted that to be the case, so now that I have a little sports car and hardly anybody can get in it, you know, so I kind of ensure that that won't happen.  But, that was some experience growing up like that.  But, those were I guess the weekend outings that we had with our dad and I guess that was about as close as we were gonna get.  But, some of the places that they visited when I think back on it I can remember a few places they seem kind of questionable and I think it probably backs up the fact that I'd say my father was a player 'cause I think it was some ladies in some of those places we went to (laughter), but my brother [HistoryMaker Donald Baker] and I didn't understand.  We'd stay in the car and play around and once in a while we'd go in some of these places.  I guess they (unclear) the places his friends were, but you know they were, they seemed kind of seamy to me.
Speaker 1: Nowadays when you look back on it?
Speaker 2: Yeah, you know it's funny what you can remember and what you didn't--you weren't analyzing it very much at the time, but you know when you sit back and think about it, we did some strange things back then, you know.
Story_ID: 192121
Speaker 1: Okay, so [HistoryMaker] Mr. [Ronald Gilbert] Baker, let's talk a little bit about the elementary school years.  Can you tell us the name of your elementary school?
Speaker 2: Okay.  As I recall correctly, it's Benning Road Elementary School [sic, Benning Elementary School, Washington, D.C.] and it was on Benning Road Northeast in Washington [D.C.] near the H Street Bridge, and I remember we walked to school, which really probably took us maybe about ten minutes or so to get there and I don't remember a whole lot that went on there, although I do remember taking field trips.  And one of the things that we did in our field trips, I remember going to the Constitution Hall, DAR [Daughters of the American Revolution] Constitution Hall [Washington, D.C.], and that was my first experience and exposure to symphony music, you know, orchestrated music and we got to see the violins and the kettledrums, you know, and the oboes and the flutes.  It was just an incredible experience because it pretty much followed on some of the classes that we used to take, well in some of our classes, they would have a record player and they would play, we'd get a story read to us and it would be like maybe Peter Rabbit or it would be Little Red Riding Hood and they apparently had records out that you play and the music and everything would go along with the reading part of it and so you'd get this visualization as the teacher is reading a story, and you hear the music, and there was always those instruments in it, so as a result seeing it live like that, you know, played by I guess it was the Washington [Civic] Symphony or something, it was just an overwhelming experience for me and then since that time in my life I always loved orchestrated music.  You know, and always loved [Pyotr] Tchaikovsky and [Johann Sebastian] Bach and [Ludwig van] Beethoven, I mean that music always inspired me.  But, I still love my soul music, you know, but then I got a better appreciation of music, a broader range of accepting some different types of music as a result of that experience.
Speaker 1: And what kind of student were you in elementary school?
Speaker 2: I don't know, I guess I was pretty much an average student, you know, 'cause my brother [HistoryMaker Donald Baker] and I we got so much attention from just being twins, I mean eventually, they broke us up at the third grade level because the teachers couldn't tell us apart.  So, as a result my brother ended up in Ms. Elder's [ph.] class and I was in Ms. Stevens' [ph.] class.  My brother got, apparently got the bad part of it because he had this really disciplinarian teacher, Ms. Elder, and she wasn't that good looking either and so I guess maybe she's just mad 'cause she didn't look too good and she was mean, I mean she was like a reincarnation of the devil according to most of the students there and I mean I was glad I wasn't in there, but I felt bad for my brother.  As a matter of fact, he got, he was held back in the third grade, had to repeat it, and I don't know if it was because of his experience with her or what, but that was the first time we had that separation, but elementary school was pretty good.  I mean we enjoyed, we did things I don't know that a lot of kids do today, but there was always a lot of things that involved the imagination.  I mean, we would go to planetariums.  We would build things in classes and stuff like that that you know you had to use your imagination to create and so it was a fun experience for me, but we were pretty much average students.  I don't know that we excelled in anything in particular 'cause we were always the center of attention, so I guess we didn't feel we had to work so hard, you know.
Speaker 1: And had you started developing a love for photography yet during the elementary school years?
Speaker 2: Not really, I don't think I really started having, I guess an affinity for photography until I got into my middle school years, junior high school [Kramer Junior High School, later Kramer Middle School, Washington, D.C.].  Back then we were pretty much always the subject of being in the pictures as opposed to taking them, so I didn't really pick up a camera at that point.  It was usually, it was probably when I was in my early, well, I guess about twelve or thirteen years old, starting junior high--

Speaker 1: During the elementary school [Benning Elementary School, Washington, D.C.] years, [HistoryMaker] Mr. [Ronald Gilbert] Baker, did you have dreams and aspirations at this time?  What did you want to be when you grew up?
Speaker 2: I know I didn't want to be on the back of a garbage truck, I knew that.  I mean back in the day, today you know the trash and the garbage is all together and they pick it up at one time.  Back then when I was growing up you had trash pickup and you had garbage pickup and, and back then you had these stainless steel, you wouldn't want stainless steel, it was probably steel garbage pails and they were like small trash cans, you know, with a lid and that job had to be the worse job ever given to a person to do you know where they actually would do it and have to go home.  I mean when the garbage man was coming you knew it because it couldn't have been, it could have been two or three blocks away, but the odor was so horrible.  I mean to this day I still can smell that garbage truck.  It was horrible, and you know in those days you had, you know you had to set it out on the curb and we just wondered how in the world could these guys pick this stuff up and throw it in there and the truck was garbage, garbage, garbage, you know it wasn't trash.  So, having to go--and I just though how in the world could that person stand themselves at the end of the day and I never wanted to be a trash man or a garbage man; I just didn't want that job.  So, my aspirations really was to be anything but that, you know, which meant you know I mean kids grow up and they say you wanna be a policeman, you know a lawyer or doctor, you know the standard kind of stuff and half the stuff black kids weren't gonna be, at least we didn't think so at the time.  So, I think I just wanted to at least have a job like my mother [Bernice Brown Baker] and father [Oscar Baker].  I wanted to be able to go off to work and wear a suit and tie, and I don't know what that job was, but I know they dressed nice when they left so and when they came home, so that's, whatever that was at the time, but I hadn't formulated some, some goal for a particular type of career or developing a certain skill at the time.
Story_ID: 192123
Speaker 1: Did you and your family attend church, and if so, what were those experiences like at church?
Speaker 2: Let me see, back in the '50s [1950s], we used to go to church every Sunday with my grandmother [Sarah Fagins].
Speaker 1: And what was the name, do you remember the name?
Speaker 2: I cannot remember.  I cannot remember the name of the church.  I remember the church was on Underwood Street Northwest [Washington, D.C.], but I cannot remember the name of that church to save my life.  All I do is remember the building and I remember it was a church that apparently they were building the church and it was actually below ground.  It was the strangest thing because apparently--I knew eventually they built a couple of levels above ground, but it was like you'd go to these steps and you go down.  It's like kind of maybe it was like going into a crypt and didn't know it, but you know, I mean it wasn't really below ground, but it was, it wasn't a very high above ground church and it was the strangest thing now that I think about it, but yeah we weren't crazy about going to church 'cause we pretty much gone kicking and screaming 'cause my father [Oscar Baker] didn't go, you know, and I know my mother [Bernice Brown Baker] went occasionally, you know, but, you know my mother and father they would party on Saturday night, so I guess they weren't in any condition to go to the church the next day.  So, I guess we were forced to go in their place, you know.  I guess we had to say a prayer for them or something, I don't know, but, but yeah during those days you'd go--it was kind of to me a scary place to be because there was always some woman that would get the Holy Ghost, as I was told, and all of a sudden they were, we were told speaking in tongues.  Now, I don't know what that was supposed to mean, you know, I guess when we got older we learned okay somehow the spirit got in them and they were saying things that only whoever could speak in tongues understands.  I never met anybody who would do that, but somebody'd always fall out in the aisle.  There were always these women who were the nurses.  They weren't like registered nurse, I mean, it may have been some of them, but you know they gave them a uniform and some kind of little pin that they put on and like a nurse's hat and I guess they walk up and down the aisles and I guess if somebody started going through something, you know, the Holy Ghost or whatever it was, or just I always felt grabbing attention because I figured like if you get the spirit how, how did the same person get the spirit every Sunday around the same time.  You know, so I figured this was somebody just, you know, they were, they had apparently become legendary in the church for getting the spirit, so now if they got the spirit it was important, you know, so we either had to pay attention or something was associated with that, so I always felt that that person was putting on.  I just didn't believe anybody got the spirit that often and such on a regular pace.  You know it was like a bus schedule.  And so I always remember the deaconesses of the church, when you know they had a processional everybody would come in.  It was always so funny to me because they always came and they came down always so slow and this rhythmic rock from left to right and it took them forever to get down the aisle, you know, this is why we pretty much hated going to church 'cause it took us all day because the processionals took forever, I mean the deacons would come in and they'd march right on down, but the deaconesses had to do this two-step from left to right and it's like they only took a half a step forward every time they did it and so it took them forever to get down there, you know, and I always thought that was kind of strange.  But, and I always thought it was strange the way the, the pastor would they'd, they'd start preaching and they'd be talking regular and stuff like that and then they'd all of a sudden go into this rage and they would be hollering and screaming and this ah-ha and, I mean, I said like why do people even talk like that, I mean, I could never understand why they did that and then I think when I got older I found that that was something that a lot of the bible schools taught, that this was just something they did.  But, I just found it annoying when I was growing up, you know, and of course there was, there was always the organist, there was that guy that you knew that he was a little girly man.  You just knew he just wasn't quite manly enough, you know because he had lacquer, you know, or some kind of nail polish on.  You know I didn't know any men that wore nail polish.  The nails were always long and looked like the ladies' nails and they wore these funny glasses and his hair was always in the process, you know, of what they called, I then when we was growing up they call them pompadours and they always had that funny smile on that face.  You know it was just something strange about 'em, and then I know in that church and another we went to, the organist was what we, I guess we learned later that they were probably, you know, had a sweet tooth for men.  I guess they call them gay now (laughter), but it was so strange you know growing up, but I knew some, it's like some things you just know is not right, you know and I mean I guess to today and you know politically correctness to each his own, but back then I just knew there was something funny about that.  You know you didn't want to get near that guy.  That was like that uncle you--people say, "Don't leave so and so with that uncle," you know, 'cause they gonna come out abused (laughter).  You just didn't want that.  You didn't want to be that child and say yeah he's a good child, but he got abused by Uncle Joe, so you just don't want to--you didn't wanna be that person.  So, we didn't ever know anybody that those pe- that the organist knew.  I mean if they had family members or whatever they never showed up in church.  We never saw 'em, 'cause they weren't, I mean they always hugged the deaconesses and assistants, the minister.  We never knew who the family members of the organist were.  I guess they just wanted to remain anonymous and apparently did a good job at it too.
Story_ID: 192124
Speaker 1: Let's talk a little bit about junior high school.  What was the name of your junior high school?
Speaker 2: Well, we went to Kramer Junior High School [later Kramer Middle School, Washington, D.C.] and it was on R Street in southeast Washington [D.C.], and that was a nice experience, because there is when you start to grow up and you're experiencing puberty and you, everybody is trying to get a girlfriend or whatever, and of course that was when you really got conscious of the fashions of the day.  And of course back then when I was in junior high school it was the Peters Jacket, which was this waist length type of a windbreaker type jacket at the time and gabardine slacks that had the pleats in them and a cuff, but you had to wear them with either a pair of Stacy Adams, preferably black with, I guess the white stitching, or some guys had orange, I guess you might call them tan, but they looked kind of orange to me, or you wore them with Chuck Taylors and Chuck Taylor was what the Nike tennis shoe is today.  Chuck Taylor I would say was really the first Converse.  Chuck Taylor was the first designer tennis shoe.  You know before then it was just Keds and you know whatever tennis shoe, but once Chuck Taylors came out, it's like if you were wearing anything other than that, you weren't living the life, whatever that was at the time.  And so you had to have that and you had to have a cap which would be, I guess, equivalent to the Kangol cap now, but you didn't wear it backwards, you wore it like a regular cap, and so fashion was real important.  And then of course in the summers there was the Hawaiian shirt and of course you had to have an Hawaiian shirt, you know, to go along with the gabardines, but then those of us who couldn't afford, you know, the real thing, the real gabardines, the real Chuck Taylor, the real Hawaiian shirt we went to Morton's [Department Store].  And of course Morton's was like your modern day Target, you know, because that was where you got everything discount and they looked like it, but of course everybody who had the real thing knew what the fake stuff was.  So, I think we didn't understand but getting the fake stuff at the time was worse than not having it all because then you were labeled as a fake, because you were wearing a Hawaiian shirt from Taiwan.  You know you were wearing not so gabbie gabardines.  You know and the Chuck Taylors these were like the fake Chuck Taylor.  They had the emblem with some kind of star or something on there, but usually the sole of a shoe was pink and Chuck Taylors' shoe soles weren't pink, so you knew you had the cheap ones, and so you couldn't hang out and act like you were well-dressed.  You only impressed somebody who didn't know any better, you know, and so we always kind of like sought those people out, you know like some of the dumber students in school who think these are like real gabs and real Hawaiian shirts and stuff like that.  So, but that was a time that we also were pretty much preparing for life, and so we would pretty much learn about the birds and the bees around that time, although I must express that we weren't as fortunate, I guess, fortunate as some of our other friends who were a lot more proactive in that, you know, arena of romance than my brother [HistoryMaker Donald Baker] and I.  We were like the ninety-pound weaklings that weighed seventy-five pounds, so nobody was really interested in Donald and I, you know, so we had to, okay, we had to survive on our twinship, you know, that was pretty much all the attention we were getting at the time.
Story_ID: 192125
Speaker 1: Who were some of your friends in junior high school [Kramer Junior High School, later Kramer Middle School, Washington, D.C.]?
Speaker 2: Well, my best friend who I had met when I was ten years old in elementary school [Benning Elementary School, Washington, D.C.], Michel Daley, he owns, one of the owners of the Zanzibar restaurant and club [Zanzibar on the Waterfront, Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 1: How did you meet Michel?
Speaker 2: Well, I met Michel when I was in fourth grade.  He was having--I overheard him telling somebody he was having a party and so being that ninety-five, ninety-pound weakling, seventy-five-pound, there wasn't anybody in school I was bullying even at that time and, and, but I overheard him say he was gonna have a birthday party and so I basically threatened him saying that he'd better invite me.  I didn't even know him, but I said well you better invite you to your party and then I said, and of course as all bullies do they, they threaten you, you know you better invite me to the party and then you say can I come?  I guess you politely ask if you can come after you've threatened somebody, you know, and so I guess I always remembered my manners.  And so he said, yeah, you can come.  I said, oh, I'll bring my brother [HistoryMaker Donald Baker] too.  He said okay.  And so we went to the party and he lived around the corner from us, and that's what you do you threaten somebody to go to a party, you don't even know where it is or where they live, you know, or who they are and I guess that's how you develop a best friend type of relationship.  But, I met Michel there and from that point on we kicked it off, 'cause we found as we hung out with each other more that his life paralleled my brother and I, both parents divorced and being raised by the mothers and it's just two of them, him and his sister, and just amazing the similarities in the way we grew up.  And so I guess by the time we got to junior high school, you know, we were still friends and we're still friends today.
Speaker 1: Let me ask you this?  Did you ever think it was odd that his name was Michel?
Speaker 2: You know it didn't seem odd to me, but it seemed odd to some other people as we got older because even today when I mention to people my best friend Michel they say, well who is she, and I say no it's M-I-C-H-E-L.  Well, the thing is that he and his sister were actually born in Louisiana, New Orleans [Louisiana], in the French Quarter and so their mother, and their family is a prominent family in Louisiana and so his father was a doctor, his mother was an educator and so as a result his sister's name is Camille, so they had French names, you know, and they spoke French, but for black people we didn't know too many black people from France or you know with French persuasion, so you have a guy name Michel, you know, we didn't meet anybody, but it didn't, it never struck me odd until other people brought it up.  And so I always kind of found myself defending, you know, him, you know because people had these pre-determinates.  He didn't name himself, you know, his mother named him, but it was just kind of funny at the time because other people saw it a little differently, but I never questioned his name because you know he never, he never acted like you think a Michel would act, you know, although Michel to me seemed like a guy's name at the time I guess because I knew him and we were friends.  But, yeah that, that was something I'm sure he continues to deal with today.
Story_ID: 192126
Speaker 1: One thing we didn't talk about was your parents' [Oscar Baker and Bernice Brown Baker] divorce.  How old were you when your parents divorced?
Speaker 2: I think my mother came to my brother [HistoryMaker Donald Baker] and I, we were about eight years old when she started preparing us for this (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What did she tell you?
Speaker 2: She basically told us that "Your father and I are not getting along, you know, it has nothing to do with you and your brother, so I want you all to still love him, but we're not gonna be together," and she explained that to us right after she had given us a bath, she was toweling us off and I remember that conversation in the bathroom with us and I think our reaction to it was, okay, you know, and we went to bed, I mean we didn't like, you know, plan to be the Menendez Brothers [Lyle Menendez and Erik Menendez] or anything like that after that experience.  I mean our thing was, it was what it was, and we didn't, I don't think we really understood it completely, but we understood it the way she explained it, and so we--she explained it in a way it's not like, trying to get us to be bitter against my father or whatever.  It just it was clear that their problem, she said, wasn't our problem, you know, and that we should still, you know, deal with him as our father and still love him and not blame him or whatever.  And pretty much that's how we did.  That's how we found out and I think we handled it as an eight-year-old would handle it, so by the time they split up completely we were--and my mother sold the house and moved into another house we were nine that year.
Speaker 1: And what impact do you think it had on you?
Speaker 2: Well, for me I knew probably maybe shortly thereafter, I gave it some thought and I said to myself that I would never leave my family the way my dad left us.  I mean, that's the way I saw it, that it was the wrong thing to do and so my feeling was that I would never do that to my family.  I would never do that to my kids, and to this day I have not done that.
Speaker 1: And did you still have an opportunity to see your father and spend time with him?
Speaker 2: We saw him a couple of times.  He remarried and he had a stepson, and I think he tried to get his stepson involved with us, you know.  It was kind of like awkward because this kid was like twelve or thirteen years old and he was like about six feet and he seemed at least six feet tall to us because we were always short.  And you know he was kind of goofy and you know it's like trying to get somebody to like somebody that you don't like 'em and I don't know why we didn't like him, probably self-conscious that we didn't like him because he wasn't related to us, you know, and maybe 'cause our dad was trying to get him to like us, like, you know, like your new stepmother.  Well, we didn't like him, so we didn't try to foster any kind of friendship or whatever.  I mean, we weren't nasty to him or anything, but we didn't see we had anything in common with him 'cause he was bigger than us, so we just figured, why bother, so we didn't.  So, our relationship with our father was kind of, it really wasn't because we didn't do anything together I mean other than a couple of incidences where he bought me my first transistor radio, and that was an experience because it took him forever to get it for me.  I don't know how much transistor radios cost back then, but I don't think they were that expensive, but they were very new on the market, but they came from Japan, so you know they probably cost maybe ten or fifteen bucks, you know, which could, I guess could have been a lot back in the '60s [1960s].  But, but we didn't really do that much together--
Story_ID: 192127
Speaker 1: So let's go back to junior high school [Kramer Junior High School, later Kramer Middle School, Washington, D.C.].  Tell me a little bit about who was influencing you at this point in your life around the junior high school years?
Speaker 2: I don't know.  I think other than music, I think in the junior high school years I don't really cause--I don't really recall any real influences as far as maybe artists or politicians.  I think maybe some of my teachers.  I mean, I don't really recall anything that was, you know, impacting my life at that time.  I don't think those things kind of happened until, probably until high school.
Speaker 1: Who were some of your teachers in junior high school?
Speaker 2: To tell you the truth, I don't remember any of my teachers in junior high school.  I really don't, you know, because that's, pretty much it was kind of a--I mean, that period was kind of--it seem like it happened very quickly, because at the time my brother [HistoryMaker Donald Baker] I think, let me see I think was it, I think by the time I was in the eighth grade 'cause we had, we were one grade apart.  When I was in the eighth grade, he was in the seventh grade.  He had gotten injured playing football in the street and ran into a car and kinda, and apparently did some internal damage to his stomach or something, and had to have an operation actually just literally hours from losing his life, but we didn't know it, 'cause we thought he was faking 'cause he ran into this tail fin of an old Chevy, a '59 [1959] Chevy and of course that stopped a whole lot of us from playing, you know, in the street.  But, so I spent a lot of time getting him to school.  I had to walk him to school 'cause he was still recovering from the operation and stuff, so when he was able to go back to school it was kind of difficult for him, but that, that period was somewhat of a blur.  I mean, I think during that time period I served the Washington Post, the Washington Star, and the Washington--the [Washington] Daily News, I served all three of those newspapers during, or started to, during that time period and so I had my own paper route--
Story_ID: 192128
Speaker 1: I don't know if you remember this story you shared with us though, about your paper route when you went to collect your fees once from two gentlemen (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh yeah, now about then I was in, that probably was in my early year in high school--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --because by then, and I take that back I probably was in my last year of junior high [Kramer Junior High School, later Kramer Middle School, Washington, D.C.] because I think I was still serving the Washington Star at that time.
Speaker 1: Can you tell us that story?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we had--my paper route was in the Parkland Apartments [Washington, D.C.] area, and I think I was serving the--one of the routes was on 23rd Street Southeast right off of Mississippi Avenue, and of course back in the day we used to have to serve the paper and then on Fridays and Saturdays or, you know, even sometimes Sundays you knocked on people's door to collect your money, and I think a paper was only about like five or ten cents, but you know you'd be amazed at how many people will tell you, you had to come back.  I mean come back for what, a dollar and something?  I mean if you thought about it, it's like these people were avoiding paying you, but this particular door I knocked on it was a Saturday morning and I never will forget it because a guy came to the door with what I later understood was a kimono and I knew it wasn't right.  You know just some things you know that's just not natural and for me to see a guy in a kimono, and barefoot, maybe he wasn't barefoot, maybe he had on like those Japanese, you know, foot thongs or whatever they were or flip-flops or something.  All I know it was, you don't come to the door dressed like that, and it looked like he had on, if wasn't wrong, it looked like he had on some kind of eyebrow liner or something like that.  I know he, he looked rather girly and so he was trying to invite me to come in and you know I told him I couldn't come in, you know I had to stay outside.  I said we're not allowed to go inside the house to collect our money.  I didn't want that door to close behind me 'cause I knew something wasn't right in that house.  And all of a sudden another guy came out from the other room and I said oh my God I knew that wasn't right at that point and I said okay.  So, that was my introduction to gay.  So, now we had a lesbian on my neighborhood when I was--across the street from my house with these two ladies.  I guess one of them at least was a lady, and the other one she was a big girl.  Oh man, I mean she had this haircut it was, you know, pretty masculine looking haircut and she was big.  I mean she always cut the grass and I always found that--I guess I never, I guess I was waiting maybe for her foot to go under the lawnmower, but that never happened, but then she didn't have a hill on that side of the street.  But that was a strange experience because that was my first experience with what I knew to be lesbianism, and so I saw that and then to have a paper route and then see the other side of that, which was the gay side, I said you know something is wrong here.  So, those are two things like I never wanted to be.  I knew I couldn't be a lesbian, but I certainly didn't want to be gay either.  So, I said I wanted to stay away from that.  But, the paper route, you know, I was very careful not to step in anybody's house after that experience, you know, but they always paid.  That was one of the great things I always could count on getting paid, but I kind of always kind of left them for the last ones.  Either they were gonna be the first ones I'd go to, to get them out the way or they'd be the last ones, you know, but they always paid, so you know, no complaints on that.
Story_ID: 192129
Speaker 1: Okay, so around junior high school [Kramer Junior High School, later Kramer Middle School, Washington, D.C.] that's when you got your first camera, so tell us what year you got your first camera and how that came about?
Speaker 2: I got my first camera in 1963 and what happened was, back in those days there used to be two major stamp companies and they were called S&H Green Stamps and there was Top Value Stamps, and the S& H Green Stamps were green and Top Value Stamps were yellow.  And usually like the old Peoples Drug stores which are now CVS's [CVS Pharmacy] would carry the Top Value Stamps.  My mother [Bernice Brown Baker], you know, every time you make a purchase they give you so many stamps and they stick them in this little book and you could redeem the coupon book for some kind of gift thing that you could get from a catalog and my mother used to collect those books, so she, I asked her about getting a camera that I saw in one of the catalogs and I knew it was about two and a half of those books and I knew how much, you know, she had to spend to get those books, so it was really special that she let me use two and half of her books to get this camera and so basically that's how I got my first camera and they called it, it wasn't a Kodak Instamatic, it was Anscomatic, so I started out with brand X from day one, which is kind of the story of my early life, never got the real thing, you always got the imitation.  But, it worked.  You know, you put this 126 film, which I don't think they make anymore, but it's--it was smaller than 35 mm, but it was larger than that little 110 film they came out back in the '70s [1970s], which I don't think it held on too long.  But, we put the--you put it in a cartridge and drop it in the camera and it pretty much worked like any other camera and so that's when I got started.
Speaker 1: And what kinds of photographs did you enjoy taking and what did you photograph?
Speaker 2: Well, I think I was just learning how to use the camera, so I would take pictures of a lot of the friends and acquaintances in the neighborhoods and you know kids playing basketball and stuff like that.  So, I mean I thought I was a photographer when I was taking this camera. I mean, I had a little Instamatic or Anscomatic plastic camera in my hands, but in my mind I was welding a Nikon, with a zoom lens like I was out on a safari or something.  So, I felt as if I was a real professional because it just gave me this power that I, you know and so if I imagined that I had to be camera, you know, I didn't have to look back at it and see well you just got this little piece of junk in your hand, but it worked because people wanted to pose in front of the camera.
Speaker 1: And were you kind of developing a reputation as like the camera guy, the guy, to go to guy to get your picture taken?
Speaker 2: Well, people didn't come to me to get their picture taken at that time, but it, after a while they expected when they saw me that I'd have the camera and I'd be taking pictures, so unfortunately a lot of the pictures I took and the negatives are long gone, you know, flown to the wind, some reason it just didn't attach the value to taking those pictures at the time and of course as I got older I realized how critical it is to make sure to maintain the negatives and the prints at least so you'd have something and, but yeah after a while I got the reputation of always having a camera with me, so I got pictures of people in almost any kind of situation that we were hanging out or doing something or going somewhere at school, whatever, I always had the camera.
Speaker 1: And how were you able to pay for developing the film?
Speaker 2: Well of course I had may paper routes and of course I was serving those papers, so I basically would put the film in, have it processed, and of course back in those days you had to wait a week and so we'd have it processed and I'd go and after I collect my money on the paper route I'd go pick up the pictures and of course that got me started on doing that as I started doing more serious work in, when I got to high school [Anacostia Senior High School, Washington, D.C.].
Story_ID: 192130
Speaker 1: Tell us a little bit about high school.  What was the name of your high school?
Speaker 2: I went to Anacostia Senior High School [Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 1: And what were some of your experiences like in high school?
Speaker 2: High school was a good experience because what I think--basically I realized once I was in high school that I was gonna be out of school in a couple of years, you know, and so you start pondering what you wanted to do in life, what you wanted to be, and one of the things I did know is that I wanted to work in an office.  I didn't want any job where I had to be outside at the time.  I just found that everybody I saw that worked outside didn't, they never was smiling, you know.  I just never saw a smile on anybody's face who had to work outside.  Of course the people we saw working outside were gardeners, trash men, you know, garbage men and everything you just, they just seemed--when you saw those people they were working hard, they were sweating, they were not happy, you know, and I could not see myself doing that.  So one of the things I did was I took some business classes, which was, and one of the classes I took was typing.  And of course back then, that was kind of unusual for guys to be taking a typing class, because that's office and of course back then everybody knew that's a woman's job to do work as a secretary and all that kind of stuff, but I saw it as an opportunity to meet girls.  So, I took the class 'cause I was, I was really after this one particular girl and I--
Speaker 1: What was her name?
Speaker 2: I can't remember her name.  All I know that she was this pretty chocolate-colored girl that just took my breath away.  But she unbeknownst to me was a senior and I think at that time I was a junior, so she had no interest in me and I didn't have the nerve to approach her, so I just figured, well maybe she will notice me if I'm in the class and I was like maybe one of two guys in the class.  But, what I was learning in typing actually helped lay the foundation for what I would be able to do in the future because obviously the keyboard was the tool which was used for data input, so eventually once I got involved with data entry and, and before you know, the desktop computers or personal computer became a big thing, having that keyboard experience and knowing how to type was very critical to work in an office environment.  So, I made the right decision in high school to pursue certain business classes, which then ultimately turned out to my benefit.  But at that point in high school, I mean, I didn't play sports.  I mean I wasn't an athlete, but I did take pictures.  I did start to take pictures then, the football games and the basketball games, stuff like that.  But, then at that point I discovered that I had the power, when I put girls in front of the camera and I would take pictures with the girls all the time at lunchtime.  Everybody wanted to be a model, so it would be easy for me to get the girls and then come back next week and give them their pictures.  And of course all my friends would always laugh at me and say oh man you got no rap, but after about two or three months of this, of constantly being out there with these girls lined up to have their picture taken by me, all of a sudden the guys who were laughing at me were running out buying cameras, especially my best friend, Michel, and my brother [HistoryMaker Donald Baker].  You know they were amongst the leaders laughing, but they stopped laughing.  And it's so funny 'cause obviously my brother developed his career as a photographer as well, but it was based on me doing it first, you know, and having to stand up to their ridicule.  You know, so that part of it, that's what pretty much got me on that, on that path; I found that I was good at working with people.
Story_ID: 192131
Speaker 1: Were you successful in terms of, did it work with the girls, did you get a lot of dates as a result?
Speaker 2: No, no, no, that didn't, apparently actually I enjoyed taking the pictures more, because I was still relatively shy, you know, and nobody was like, knocking themselves out to ask one of the Baker twins for a date.  I don't think we were like horrendous looking or anything like that it's just that you know we weren't on anybody's dream list, we were like we were in sports, we were the last ones chosen.  If you had to have nine players on a baseball team, which you did, and if, they didn't--the ninth person had to be, on either team was gonna be my brother [HistoryMaker Donald Baker] or I, you know, but we were the last resort and so I think that was our lot in life with the girls, we were like the last resort, so nobody was that interested, which was so funny because the girl I ended up going to the prom with, I was like the last resort for her because apparently who she wanted to go to the prom with the guy didn't ask he went with some other girl and I felt lucky 'cause this girl was beautiful and you know I mean I just couldn't believe she went out to the prom with me.  Course ultimately that experience was not a great experience, because we went out to the prom that was held at the Willard Hotel [Washington, D.C.], which back then was really a dump, of course shortly after we had our--when we graduated in '67 [1967] shortly after that they renovated, they tore it up, you know, the thing apart and renovated it and of course now it's a luxury hotel, but back then it was a dump and so as a result when we went out that night she got sick, so she said, so I gave her cab money 'cause I didn't drive at the time 'cause I didn't have a car, and so we went with a neighbor of mine whose parents had just bought them, he and his sister, a new '67 [1967] [Chevrolet] Camaro, 'cause that's when the car first came out and here we are riding in style to the prom, but I did give her cab money to get back home.  Well, we, my first experience staying out all night.  Well, ultimately what happened was went to a party and 3:30 in the morning guess who was at the party, my date who had just gotten sick.  So, that was my first experience being dumped, but I was too stupid to feel really bad about it you know.  It just taught me a lesson that people could be kind of fickle, so that experience was when I look back on it, it was probably a little tough on me 'cause it was kind of embarrassing 'cause some of the people I went with obviously said man is that your date over there (laughter), wasn't she sick.  You know I'm feeling like a real idiot at this point, but I guess it didn't better me as much as it probably did later, I mean later I found out that, she was married, and divorced and overweight and so it's like she got her comeuppance, she continued to live and got worse and I continued to live and got better.  So, it's like you felt like there was some justice being served out there, and not that I would wish her anything bad, but I think I probably wished her something bad and it probably happened, you gonna be stuck with some bad kids and a no good husband.  But, other than that, but that was probably my worst experience.  But, I had a good experience in high school [Anacostia Senior High School, Washington, D.C.], my homeroom class I had a teacher, Mr. Hazel, you talking about names.  His first name was Fleeks, F-L-E-E-K-S.  You imagine being a student with a teacher's name, first name is Fleeks.  Fleeks B. Hazel, but he was like a real father figure to us, and he always had a saying that he would tell us you know, "He who plays in the sands the desert will not enjoy the shade of the olive tree."  Now you know a black man saying something like that, you know, that's tantamount to blasphemy, what in the world is he talking about?  We never really understood it, but basically he was saying you all screw around during these years of high school and you don't get what you're supposed to get, then you won't be able to sit back and enjoy life because you will not achieve your education.  And, so we really began to understand that at the time, a little later, but Mr. Hazel was, he was a great teacher and I still keep in touch with him today.  I mean, he's probably in his mid-seventies, but he was a really, really great influence on me when you talk about people who had influenced.  He was a real influence on me and a lot of the other students that were in this homeroom class.  And, but basically throughout high school you know that's where I really developed my real passion for photography and it went beyond just taking pictures of girls, I mean, that was a good byproduct, but it wasn't--I began to get more involved in getting good quality work 'cause I would look at National Geographic magazines and stuff like that and I wanted that quality of work.  And I knew I wasn't going to get that with that little plastic camera, but I didn't have the money to get a real 35 millimeter camera, so that didn't happen until after I graduated.
Story_ID: 192132
Speaker 1: And so tell me when you were in high school [Anacostia Senior High School, Washington, D.C.] what were you thinking you were gonna do with your life?  What were you thinking?  Were you thinking about college?  What were you thinking about?
Speaker 2: Well, what happened was I was fortunate because back in those days they had the summer work program, so as a result in, in those times you could apply for a job during the summer and I was applying for a job in the government and a position in '65 [1965].  My first summer job was in '65 [1965], was working in the public relations office in the [U.S.] Navy Department on Constitution Avenue in these buildings they call the temporary buildings, which were buildings that were constructed during World War II [WWII] and so we were right alongside the [Lincoln Memorial] Reflecting Pool [Washington, D.C.], and so I worked in the public relations office.  I guess it was their way of, you know, putting young black people in an office environment because most of the people were white, so you kind of like felt like a little animal in a cage in a zoo 'cause everybody is looking at you.  I guess we were, I guess you might say the charity case, but I came there with typing skills and stuff like that, so it started to benefit me.  Well, basically what happened was being in that environment and being able to produce and I did typing and at the time we called it xeroxing, you know reproduction and carrying messages and mail and stuff like that, so just any just general office type work.  And so I got a good understanding of how things worked in the office and was able to perform the duties and also was influenced by the people in the office, because I never will forget like a lot of black kids from the inner city, we don't tend to enunciate, and so therefore we shorten everything and of course now it's called hip hop, but back then, you know, it was just called bad grammar.  And one of the things that we would do is we'd say ax instead of ask, and my supervisor at the time I said something like "I wanna ax you a question," and he said, "Now is that ax like in cutting wood or is that ask?"  And I remember being so embarrassed that this white man is correcting me.  But, he was right and I never forgot that again and I never said ax unless I was referring to a tool.  And, and I do that to other people, to other kids, in hopes that they will be influenced the same way I was about that experience.  But, being exposed to that environment where you're dealing with people who did speak well and people who were in an office environment where that was their job to be able to communicate information coming out of various areas in the Navy Department and redistributing that information to the press and to the other departments within the [U.S.] Department of Defense; that gave me a good understanding.  So, the experience of that during the summers and then some of the classes I was taking in high school really prepared me and, and it allowed me to see where I really wanted to be, in an office environment, because I found that I wasn't half bad in that environment and so that's what really got me started on working inside you might say in an office environment by having that experience.
Story_ID: 192133
Speaker 1: And at this time, your last year in high school [Anacostia Senior High School, Washington, D.C.], had your mother [Bernice Brown Baker] become ill at this time?
Speaker 2: Well, my mother actually became ill in 1965.  She was still employed at the government printing, was it government?  Yeah, she was still at the government printing office at the time.  And as a result, she had to retire on disability because she had developed high blood pressure and I think she had hypertension and all of the things that people from her generation got from bad diets, smoking, alcohol, all the things that you weren't warned would kill you, that you thought they were just social things you did, 'cause, I mean my parents came from the South, so you know pig feet, you know, pork chops, you know anything from a pig, you know to chicken and steaks and so everything bad for you we consumed it, and as a result it shortened their life span, which caused my brother [HistoryMaker Donald Baker] and I to do just the opposite.  We stopped eating those things and of course we never smoked or drank, but you know the point was we had reason for not doing it, you know from our parents' experience.  So, my mother and father [Oscar Baker] actually died six months apart in 1969.  So, we were already out of high school at the time, but while we were probably in my junior and senior year of high school, those years my mother was really ill and in and out of the hospital, so that was a kind of difficult period for us at that time.
Story_ID: 192134
Speaker 1: And so after graduation, what did you decide to do?
Speaker 2: Well, after graduation I knew I didn't have the money to go to college, so I went, I was fortunate I was able to get a permanent position as an office clerk typist in the job I was working at in the summer in the [U.S.] Navy Department.  So, I just basically started my work career at that time, but that allowed me to invest the same year in my first 35 millimeter camera, so then at that point I had my first real camera with an interchangeable lens, and put real film in it and you know you just, you know now, at this point, now I'm prepared to work for 'National Geographic' and/or 'Playboy', you know whichever came first, and not necessarily in that order, but--
Speaker 1: Do you remember how much that you paid for the camera?
Speaker 2: I know it was a Mamiya 35 millimeter, and I think the camera probably cost maybe about sixty or seventy dollars at the time.
Speaker 1: And this was in 1967?
Speaker 2: This is in 1967.
Speaker 1: Nineteen sixty-seven [1967].
Speaker 2: Yeah, so the camera to get though, as I learned from one of my colleagues in the public relations office, he was a black man, Mr. Harper, I never will forget him he was a real educated brother and he was an artist, and he was one of those brothers who with all of his talents and skill it took him forever to get in that position.  With a college education, going into the government they put you in the mail room or reproduction--(unclear)-- any of the jobs that you were overqualified for.  So, he was one of those guys that really had to work hard to get to the job where he was qualified for as a graphic artist and he had a Nikon camera and that was like the camera card to have, Nikon F.  And that was the camera you aspire to get, but I didn't want to spend the money for it.  I think probably the camera cost about $280 or $300.  I couldn't see spending that kind of money for a camera, but he said, you could either buy the camera now or you will, you will pay what it would cost you by the time you buy two or three or four of those cameras, and he was right.  He said if you want something, get what you want now and not worry about the price if you can afford it as much as, 'cause if you're gonna ultimately get it, you gonna probably have spent the money anyway in the process of leading up to getting it, buying all these cheap cameras and other equipment.  So that's--I took that from him as part of the philosophy that I learned--
Story_ID: 192135
Speaker 1: And how were you developing your craft, your skill since, you know, you weren't in college studying it?  How were you developing it on your own?
Speaker 2: Well, I did it by buying books.  So, I would buy books and basically I would teach myself.  One of the things that I did that I wasn't proud of, you know, is I don't often talk about it, but it was my period of, I was in the period of denial.  I lied about developing my own film and making my own prints.  It was a part of my life that I really, I look back on it with a great deal of shame.  'Cause people ask me, do you develop your own film.  Well of course, if you're supposed to be a photographer, of course I do what kind of question is that, but I didn't.  You know I didn't have a dark room.  I didn't have any chemicals or anything like that, but I'd tell people I did it, you know, and apparently I must have gotten caught in a lie or something like that.  Somebody came by the house and said, where are all the chemicals and stuff?  You know, I had to throw them out, you know, they spoiled (laughter), something like--but whatever I think I got pushed into doing it.  I think probably I got an assignment that required that some film be developed, black and white, something like that, so I had to buy it.  So, I went to Penn Camera, at the time, I think.  No, I take that back, Potomac Photo--
Speaker 1: Well, first tell us about your first experience with trying to develop film on your own.
Speaker 2: Well, the first experience was, you look at TV and you see film being developed in this dark room, so I figured okay we've got a bathroom, I can turn the light off, and it will be dark, you know, forget the fact that you know I had to put towels along the base of the door 'cause you still had the light coming in under the door.  And what I did was open up the cassette of film and put water in the sink and dipped it in there and I'd pull it up and down, like I saw on TV and I'm standing in the dark and then I turned the light on 'cause that's that they did on TV.  The thing was they were using a red light on TV.  They were using trays.  They were using chemicals, and they did everything in total darkness.  And of course I realized once I didn't have anything developed, you know well apparently water doesn't do it (laughter), and so I was forced you know to get a book and learn, oh you got to put chemicals in this water (laughter) and there's like two or three steps to the process.  So, you know, after, you know, accepting the fact that I had really done something really stupid that I probably shouldn't share publically, I was motivated to learn.  And so I moved from the sink to the tub, so I was able to put like three trays in the tube and you know and I got the thermometer--(unclear)--and when I developed my first roll of film it was like incredible experience, I mean, it was like I was free to do anything that I was capable of doing, 'cause now I could develop film, and so once I did that I was able to take assignments that required film, developing a film in black and white, and making prints and then from that I got the enlarger and started learning how to make prints and stuff like that.
Speaker 1: And what year did you get your first professional assignment?
Speaker 2: I didn't get my--I can almost say I got my first professional assignment back in, I'm not sure when was that.  I'd say professional assignment 'cause I got paid.  I think my first true professional assignment was 1974, that's when I established my company, because I was actually paid to do a wedding and I was actually doing my best friend's sister's wedding; it was kind of my play sister.  So, that's when I document as my first professional work, but I had done things for other people before, but I was doing it for the experience, so I really wasn't considering myself a professional in the early '70s [1970s] because I was try- I was still learning and I was trying to really commit myself, 'cause you know you're working and you're doing this on the side, but it's not real work, but once people start paying you real money then you really gotta do it right and you know, so at that point was when I really in '74 [1974] is when I considered myself a real professional, but by then I had invested in some really top quality equipment.  I had my darkroom skills and I was using photo labs to do my printing and developing.  I wasn't taking it to the drug store.
Story_ID: 192136
Speaker 1: Have we talked about yet you going into the [U.S.] Army?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay, we, we skipped that didn't we?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, so what year did you go into the Army?
Speaker 2: Well, my brother [HistoryMaker Donald Baker] and I actually originally got drafted in 1969, but that was the year that my mother [Bernice Brown Baker] died, so I think I take that back we got drafted in 1968.  But, because my mother was in the hospital, they deferred that draft notice and so when my mother died in '69 [1969], I think two years later, we had to go in.  So, we went in, we served.  We did not go to Vietnam [The Vietnam War] because we were the only surviving sons, so we served our two years here in the states.  My brother went to Fort Carson, Colorado, after basic training and then came back here to Fort [George G.] Meade and served out the seventeen months.  I went to Fort Knox, Kentucky, and then came back here to Fort Belvoir, Virginia, and served my last seventeen months.  So, we really were fortunate and we were able to actually live in the house that we inherited from our mother and we were able to basically live off the base, but still report.  So we did our two years in the Army.  I actually was like the company radar and so I was the company clerk, you know, did the morning reports.  I made sure everybody got paid, stuff like that and I did that, I had that type of position in Fort Knox, Kentucky, as well as at Fort Belvoir, although in Fort Belvoir I worked for this department called the department of non-resident training and it was part civilian, part military, and they did training courses and so I handled a lot of the, the materials associated with that and then the general office work.
Speaker 1: Did you take any, were you still taking photographs while--(simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: Yes, as a matter of fact during my whole stint in the Army everywhere I went I was able to utilize my photography skills, because once they realized I could do it they would give me these little assignments even within the department or the branch I was in, and so I always got recognition for my photography work and that gave me additional confidence that I was getting pretty good.
Story_ID: 192137
Speaker 1: After you left the [U.S.] Army, then you went back to your job with the [U.S.] Navy (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, I went back to my job at the Navy Department and stayed there for a year. I went back and I really didn't feel that welcome when I went back.  It's like the person who I replaced, who had replaced me, apparently didn't understand that I had a right to that job and I had just finished serving my country, involuntarily, 'cause the notice I got, the letter I got in the mail was greetings, you know, didn't invite me, told me, and so I was kind of, you know, put off by the fact that the welcoming party wasn't exactly a welcoming party.  But, after a year I saw I had more potential than the position I was in, and I think I just literally had gotten bored with that, that position and saw I wasn't going anywhere and so I figured I would go back to college, so I started at that time was--
Speaker 1: Did you utilize the G.I. Bill when you went?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yes, and so at that time it was called Federal City College.  It's the University of District of Columbia [Washington, D.C.] now, but it was Federal City College and it was probably only about a year old when I started at Federal City.
Speaker 1: What year was this, [HistoryMaker] Mr. [Ronald Gilbert] Baker?
Speaker 2: Nineteen seventy-four [1974].
Speaker 1: And what did you study there?
Speaker 2: Mass communications, television production, cinema photography.  My professor was Tex Scathings [ph.], who was really a real character at that school.  I mean, he was like, he would go off in a minute.  I remember him ripping the phone out of the wall one time because he couldn't get in touch with somebody and the next thing I know somebody was hollering "Tex, no!"  And all of a sudden he was ripping the phone out of the wall and smashed it to the floor and then the next moment he was like normal and I'm saying boy, he really vents his anger in special ways doesn't he.  But you know, but he was a great guy, a good mentor, and I recognized him in my first book.
Story_ID: 192138
Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] Mr. [Ronald Gilbert] Baker, after you left your job at the [U.S.] Navy Department, what did you do next?
Speaker 2: Well, I went straight to Federal City College [later University of the District of Columbia, Washington, D.C.]--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and started studying mass media and studying photography.
Speaker 1: You were a full-time student?
Speaker 2: I was a full-time student.  I was using my G.I. Bill, which was paying me about $320 a month, which was good because I was only paying about a hundred dollars a month on the mortgage, which we ultimately paid off that year and--of my mother's [Bernice Brown Baker] house, and so I was doing that and my photography and of course on campus it was always a lot of girls, so I always had opportunity to enhance my skills there.  Actually I still have pictures of some of the young ladies I photographed back then.  I still have them.  I'm sure some of them would be more than happy to see those pictures today.
Speaker 1: And at this time were you thinking, wow, I could probably really make a living doing this?
Speaker 2: Actually by that time I didn't give it a whole lot of thought, but I knew at that point that I really didn't want to do a nine to five [job], but I knew ultimately because of the responsibilities I had and of course I didn't have any children at the time and we, my wife [Imogene Baker] and I were still married and we were about three years, four years from having Kellee at that time, and that was based on our plan not to have children until we'd been married five years, and if she could put up with me after that, then we would have children.  So that was an agreement we made when we got married in '73 [1973].  So, I hadn't really given a lot of thought, but I knew it was something that I could do and make money with on the side, so I kind of committed myself to enhancing as much as I could my skills, so that I could at least get some work here and there, do a couple of weddings, whatever, something that would pay for itself, 'cause I still felt I was still learning a lot, you know.
Story_ID: 192139
Speaker 1: And when was your first photograph published?
Speaker 2: First photograph was published in the Afro-American newspaper [AFRO-American Newspapers] in 1975 and the credit went to Mr. [Cliff] Cabell who was the staff photographer, and needless to say I was crushed, because you know you gotta carry this picture around from the newspaper, and then you carry the picture you took, and you said the credit really is mine, but they put the other photographer's name.  Well you know after a while too much explanation messes up the purpose of showing the picture, and so I just used that as an opportunity to remember to always put my name on the back of the print and make sure that the publisher knows to use my name, otherwise he can't publish the picture.
Speaker 1: And what was it a photograph of?
Speaker 2: It was a photograph of a young lady, Avis Harrell, who was Miss Black D.C., and she was as a matter fact a young lady that we grew up with her family, her sisters and brother and they were, as a matter of fact, had a young little singing group and they were very talented singers, a group called the Fawns, and they sang around town and stuff and then they got a record contract, released a couple of mild hits regional.
Speaker 1: And when you saw your picture published in the newspaper how did it--
Speaker 2: Oh that was like the greatest feeling in the world.  It's like, you wanna run outside and tell everybody this is my work, this is my work.  Of course from my perspective I couldn't do that.  This might work as my work, but oh, that's not my name.  And I still have that picture today, but it was a nice feeling because I'd never had my work published before.  So, when you know a lot of people are seeing something you did even though at that time wasn't connection my name to it, it is something that I knew.  And every time I did that at every level, be it something in the newspaper, my first album cover for a recording artist.  You know your first national newspaper or magazine, all of those things extremely important events and benchmarks in your life.
Story_ID: 192140
Speaker 1: And let's talk a little bit about your first celebrity shoot.  What year was that and how did it come about?
Speaker 2: Okay, in 1976 I happened to go to what was called at the time I think the Sagittarius Club, which was on the corner of Connecticut [Avenue] and R Street Northwest, Washington [D.C.] and what happened was, I was taking pictures, actually outside and I was taking pictures of different celebrities and stuff that was attending an event for Muhammad Ali and he was in town to fight Jimmy Young at the Capital Centre [Landover, Maryland].  And so they had this big party for him and I met people like J. C. Hayward and a few other people at this event, but what happened was, some guy who was working for Don King saw me and kind of escorted me in, and said you need to take pictures of this, that, and whatever.  So, I'm taking pictures and I'm excited 'cause now I'm like, you know, I'm like part of the press, without a press pass and, which actually has been my whole career, I think as far as photojournalism is concerned.  And basically what happened was the guy who hired me, this guy named, I can't remember I think it's Charles Jones [ph.], but the thing was that he worked for Don King in public relations.  The next day when I developed the film and was trying to catch up with him, couldn't find him because he had gotten fired by Don King for putting a lunch tab for 300 kids on Don King's tab, so Don King fired him.  So, here I am stuck with all these pictures and nobody to show them to.  So, went back home and found out that Don King was staying over here in the Landover [Maryland] area or New Carrollton [Maryland] area at the time at the I think it was called the Sheraton Hotel at that time and so something tells me, well, go over there and see if you can meet up with Don King or somebody representing him, show him the pictures, and see if you can sell some of them.  So, I was trying to make some money at this point 'cause I spent my money doing this and so I don't know where I got the nerve to do it and I went right over there and I said, I went to the desk and asked for Don King's room and they gave it to me and they'd never do that today, but they gave me the room and they called up and a Mr. Griffin [ph.] answered the phone, which was Don King's personal assistant, and I told him who I was and what I had, and he said well come on up.  So, I went up and I go into this suite, and of course you Don King has to have a big suite, and I'm looking around I'm just really impressed and Don King is not in the room, he's in the bedroom, and so I show the pictures to this Mr. Griffin and told him, you know, if Mr. King is interested in any of them I'd be glad to sell some of them to him.  What he did was he took them back to the bedroom and he came back out, and when he came back out, he said well Mr. King saw some of the stuff that he liked and he may only like a few of them and then that's when Don King came out.  But you know it's like you, it's like, you know, a glow preceded him, and then it was the hair, and then it was him and it was like, you know.  So, I'm trying to act cool like I'm used to this type of environment, so it's no big deal, but it was a big deal inside, you know, I'm running a hundred miles an hour and it was so funny because when he came out he said yeah I really like your work and everything, but he said I only saw a few pictures I like.  I said well, whatever ones you like, go with those and I said some of the other ones I said you're welcome to, I said, because I'm gonna lose money on this deal anyway, and he said well, just hold on a second.  So, he went back and went through a few more of them, and they said, well, what are you doing tonight, and I said well let me call my secretary and I'll see and so I called time, you know, and so while he was saying, you know, at the tone the time will be and I'm saying well what's on my calendar for the night and supposedly this, you know, phantom voice is telling me what's on the calendar.  So, now I'm hoping they can't hear the time.  You know I think back on it and they probably could, but you know hey Don King was one of the greatest hustlers of all times, so I was hustling him.  So, I said, well okay cancel all my appointments for this evening, I think Mr. King has something for me to do.  So when I got off I said I'm free for the evening.  He said okay why don't you come down here to the Embassy Row Hotel [Washington, D.C.] on Embassy Row on Massachusetts Avenue Northwest because I'm having a big party, it's called Golden Circle Ball, and everybody who has five hundred dollar ringside tickets and up, gets to come to this ball and you know we have entertainment and everything.  So, I go to the Embassy Row Hotel.  Oh, it's just fabulous, but the thing is here's how I get there.  He tells me to come back to the hotel that evening and meet them and I will be riding over there in the limo, so I go over there and I swear I see this is the biggest limo I ever seen, I mean I hadn't been in a limo since a funeral, so you know to go on there for other reasons was a nice experience and it was the first time for me.  And so I'm going in there with the big man, and we roll over the hotel, to the Embassy, and it's just a great, great time, I mean all these celebrities, Edward Bennett Williams, who was the owner of the [Washington] Redskins or one of the key partners of the Redskins at the time.  He had entertainers like Lloyd Price.  [HistoryMaker] Marion Barry was there.  He was a councilman at the time and of course he was seen with several ladies.  As a matter of fact I got pictures of him with several ladies there and just a number of people that were there who weren't, who I didn't really know who were either coming into prominence or already prominent, it's just I didn't know who they were, but, I was photographing everybody, I mean.  And then I went home, developed the film, got it back to Mr. King's hotel the next morning.  Well lo and behold, he loved the proof sheets and everything and said, well what are you doing tonight?  I said well I don't know I have to check with my secretary.  So, I called the weather, you know, so while they were giving me the weather and I'm saying okay well cancel everything else I think Mr. King has something else for me to do.  So, I get off the phone and I say I'm free Mr. King, what would you like?  He said well you know the fight is tonight, so we'd like you to come in and like you to follow me around, take pictures with me with anybody that I talk to, and so he said I don't want you taking pictures of the fighters, you're supposed to take pictures of me, no problem.  So, I said can I have my brother [HistoryMaker Donald Baker] come in.  So, I got my brother to come in and Donald was able to take pictures during the fight, which now I'm mad 'cause I should have taken some, so I had no pictures of Ali fighting, you know, but I had pictures of him at the weigh-in and stuff like that.  So, we went by to the fight by the limo and I'm taking pictures of him with, you know, these famous, well they weren't famous to me, Abe Pollin and people like that.  I didn't know who they were, but whoever he stood with I took a picture of them and so we, we did that and that was really our first really true celebrity experience.  But, within three days I would meet and develop a friendship with Van McCoy who was being celebrated in D.C. with his own day for winning a Grammy [Award] for 'The Hustle,' you know, so that was really the start with Don King and then it just kind of exploded from there.
Story_ID: 192141
Speaker 1: And how did you meet Van McCoy?
Speaker 2: Well, someone had referred me to Paul Cohn, who was partnered in a production house with Van McCoy, a place called White House Productions up in Silver Spring, Maryland, and they had referred me as the person who could take the pictures.  So, I was hired to follow Van McCoy around all day to the record stores and to [District of Columbia] City Hall [Washington, D.C.] and to all these proclamations and all that kind of stuff and through the course of the day we kind of developed a friendship, 'cause I had to interact with him to get him the type of pictures that we were trying to take and of course a lot of dancing, him dancing doing the Hustle and stuff like that.  And so ultimately when they saw the pictures, he developed an interest in having me come in and take pictures at some events that he was going to and one of them was the [U.S.] Naval Academy [Annapolis, Maryland], and at that academy they were performing at a concert and he did the, you know, he was doing the Hustle.  He had this big symphony orchestra; it was just awesome.  But, what came out of that was a picture I took, which was my first picture of the week, of him doing the Hustle with one of his back-up singers, Dianne Destry, and as a result, that being my first picture of the week, that really cemented--
Speaker 1: And what's a picture of the week?
Speaker 2: Picture of the week is one of the photos, they don't call them photos of the week now and they usually have two or three, but back then they usually ran one picture of the week and that would be a full page shot of some celebrity or something that Jet deemed the picture of the week and I had submitted that picture and it just happened, and that was the first time you know that the picture had my full name on it.  Now, now I was excited about that because that was really truly my first national exposure as far as my work and that also cemented the relationship I had with Van McCoy and their people because that was more publicity for them.  And so, as a result ultimately, we became really close friends and I was his last personal photographer up until his death, you know, in 1979.  So, that, that was really an awesome experience during that period of time.
Speaker 1: And did that lead to more celebrity--
Speaker 2: Well, yeah--
Speaker 1: --shoots?
Speaker 2: --it all snowballed 'cause from '76 [1976], when I did Don King to present everything piggybacked on each other 'cause once you start doing stuff for one famous person they see the work, then they refer you to someone else and no matter what event you attend, whosever in the picture with a famous person contacts you, because they want that picture and so you end up doing work for so many, I mean it's a small circle, but it's a big small circle in this town.  But it's--once your name gets out there and once people like what you do and you show up as dependable and delivering, you know, 'cause we don't get a second chance to get it done, you gotta have that shot right there, and, but it has been something that has been our reputation of being able to deliver on as a result.  We have been able to meet people and go places where, you know, I think without photography would not necessarily have been open to us.
Story_ID: 192142
Speaker 1: And can you share some more stories with us about some of the other celebrities that you've worked with?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well we worked with some (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) How about the Jack- how about if I throw out some names and you can--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Okay, so the Jackson Five, Michael Jackson.
Speaker 2: Okay, we got hired, I believe, I don't know for certain, but we got hired I think through a recommendation of Paul Cohn, 'cause he was managing Peaches and Herb at the time.  Peaches and Herb we started working with in '76 [1976].  It's actually the same year that I met Van McCoy because they were all--he was producing Peaches and Herb's first album and, well second album, this is the new Peaches, Linda Greene, and so as a result of him producing their album, they wanted me to do the first promo pictures.  So, I did all of the first promo pictures of Herb and Linda, and so I think as a result of that experience, I got referred to do the Jacksons.  I got a call from California from their management company called Weisner-DeMann Management and they said, well we were referred to you, and we'd like you to meet the Jacksons at the Sheraton Hotel, which is where I met Don King, you know, and they were coming in to do a concert at Capital Centre [Landover, Maryland] and that's where they were staying and so I was able to go out, meet them, took pictures of them getting off the bus going into the hotel and stuff like that, and then I had a sit-down meeting with Michael, and he was all shy.  We were sitting in a room that really wasn't that well lit, now that I think about it.  It was kind of dark in there, but we were going over what kind of shots they wanted, what they wanted to do, and you know it's like pulling hen's teeth trying to get him to talk, you know, a little bit more.  I couldn't hardly hear him, I mean, he just was so reserved.  It was like, he was just shy to I think a point that it was just ridiculous.  But, nonetheless, we hit it off a little bit and he talked about he had a dark room at home and he developed film and stuff like that.  So, we had something in common, but you know, I guess I never really did much to expand on that relationship and I'm kind of disappointed that I didn't because he was real nice to talk to and stuff, but I think he just, I think he needed somebody who had something in common with him and I think people who were around him were more yes sir kind of people, and but you know obviously he went on to do okay for himself.  But, it was a good experience working for them because I was able to bring my brother [HistoryMaker Donald Baker] in and we were able to cover a lot of stuff and we get, able to see, and they weren't as big as they were when they were the Jackson Five, of course by then they were the Jacksons, but they were still big, but then it was the year prior to Michael releasing the 'Off the Wall' solo project, which launched him as an international superstar, so we pretty much got pictures of Michael and his brothers before he made the music transformation to a solo artist as well as before he made, before he crossed the color line, so there was a lot of things historical about that experience--
Story_ID: 192143
Speaker 1: And we worked with Donna Summer, my brother [HistoryMaker Donald Baker] and I.  We actually sneaked into her room.
Speaker 2: How'd you do that?
Speaker 1: We had some passes from Jet magazine.  E. Fannie Granton, who used to write the social column for Jet magazine's society column from Washington [D.C.], for the Washington DC Perspective [sic, Washington Scene].  She got us some--she kind of was like a mentor, and she got us some passes to go see Donna Summer at Painters Mill [Theatre, Baltimore, Maryland] and what we did was when we got a hold of the passes we were saying, "We're from Jet magazine we need to do an interview with Ms. Summer," and somebody just led us right to her dressing room.  So, we go in there right at the intermission of the show and I think they were having like a forty-five-minute intermission.  We go in there and you know she and her sisters who were doing some back-up singing, were sitting there talking and stuff and of course they're amazed at these two twin photographers, and so by the time we were there in a half hour, I mean, it's like we were like lifetime buddies or something and it's so funny because it, I think a couple of her sisters was trying to hit on my brother.  I'm saying hey y'all could do better.  Y'all can't do no better than that.  You can tell they'd been on the road too long and they must have been desperate and so it was really funny because our talk, was talking with Donna and we took some pictures of her and her publicist and stuff and I told her I wanted to do an interview with her for Ebony magazine.  Well, obviously I didn't have any credentials for that, but she said she would be glad to do it and, but she said she couldn't do it that night because they had to finish the show, and then they had to go on to Cleveland [Ohio] the next day, but she would call me from Cleveland, and I'm saying yeah, yeah sure, I'm saying that to myself of course.  The next day at two o'clock, the phone rings she calls me from Cleveland and we sit on the phone and talk for two hours.  She let me record the conversation over the phone.  You know I had one of those little--back then you could get those things, the little things with the little suction cup, stick it on the phone, and you could basically eavesdrop, but she, I told her I was doing that and she said it was okay, so I told her I didn't have to do a transcript.  And I did it, we had a great talk, I mean she talked about things that I think she just wanted to talk about and it got really personal and by the time I started doing the transcript a week or so later I think I got into about fifteen or twenty pages, and then I realized, these are things she just wanted to talk about.  I don't think these are things that she'd want to share with everybody and so I felt that we were like at a personal relationship type of discussion that it just wasn't for everybody, just like venting and so I never submitted it to Ebony magazine.  I just felt it wasn't necessary and I didn't do that.  And sometimes I look back on that 'cause that following year she put out the 'Bad Girls' album.  She had the 'Bad Girls' special on TV and she like blew up and I'm saying, man you know, you probably should have, but it was just the way I am.  It was just a personal thing and I felt that, you know, that was just between us and I kept it that way, and it's been like that, you know, since.
Story_ID: 192144
Speaker 1: Of all the celebrities that you've worked with, who did you enjoy working with the most and why?
Speaker 2: Probably Muhammad Ali.  I enjoyed working with him.  I really enjoyed working with Bill Cosby, 'cause see, Bill Cosby was real interactive and see he used to like, really mess with my brother [HistoryMaker Donald Baker] and I, 'cause you know, 'cause it was two of us, you know he really gave us a lot of grief.  You know he'd always had a joke.  I mean, he'd start joking about us and he didn't even know us when we first met, he didn't even know us.  All he know was we were twins, you know as if we grew up in the neighborhood with him, he'd just start in on you.  I enjoyed working with, you know, people like Donnie Simpson.  We played golf together occasionally.  Russ Parr.
Speaker 1: And Russ Parr is a radio personality.
Speaker 2: Yes, radio personality with Radio One, has a syndicated show in the morning.  There's so many people.  [HistoryMaker] Cathy Hughes, I met her.  She helped me when I published my first coffee table book ['Solid Images: A Collection of Memories'] in '94 [1994], and she had me on her show--
Story_ID: 192145
Speaker 1: Let's talk a little bit about your book, starting with the title of the book and why you wanted to do it.
Speaker 2: Okay, well I published a book in 1994, it's called 'Solid Images:  A Collection of Memories' and basically it was a compilation of pictures that I had taken over a twenty-year period, well really a nineteen-year period.  I just say twenty to round it off, but it covered from 1975 to 1993 and basically it was my attempt at putting together images that after I started to compile them, were really kind of somewhat historic, at least for me, and it was also at a time when my wife [Imogene Baker] had gotten ill and things were a little touch and go, so I felt, life's not guaranteed to any of us, and if you're gonna do something you better get going in doing it.  And so that was my real motivation to have something down in case something didn't work out with her, that I could dedicate the book to her and as it turned out, things did work out.  And, but when I published that book my thoughts were to put something out there that kind of reflected those nineteen years and what things were going on because we covered the gamut from Tina Turner and when I took pictures of Tina she was still with Ike [Turner], so you know I had pictures of Ike, but I never published those pictures 'cause I didn't want to glorify abusive men and I felt putting his picture in there, even though I was a photojournalist, it didn't do anything for me because to me Tina was always the center of the show, you know he just tried to steal some of her spirit, but in fact I think he made her a stronger woman as a result of it.  So, I didn't want to glorify him, so I've never published any pictures I did of Ike, even though I had some good ones I didn't see any purpose in doing it.  I mean I may do it in the next book, but it certainly would be with an asterisk.  But as a result of that, though that book basically was my entry into publishing because I had to do everything myself.  Once I got it printed up I had to do all the marketing and promotion.  I was able to get on, like I said, the [HistoryMaker] Cathy Hughes show several times.  She was real supportive in helping me out.  Of course, she was in it too; that didn't hurt her, and I was able to get some response from Jet magazine who wrote a piece on it and BET [Black Entertainment Television] did a review of my book in between the review of Janet Jackson and Michael Jackson, which I have a tape here somewhere.  I mean that was incredible because it came on and we didn't know it.  A young lady, Sherry Carter, said she would, she would do something on it.  And I met her at an event I was doing on boarder babies, where I was covering Larry King and Babyface, who were co-chairs of this event.  And she said she would do something, and you know you get people who say things, and you don't take them at their word necessarily and sure enough my brother [HistoryMaker Donald Baker] and I were sitting up talking strategy about the book and here's this thing that comes on and they mention [HistoryMaker] Ron[ald Gilbert] Baker, photographer to the stars, and his new book and they start showing pictures of different people who are in the book.  I'm like, shocked 'cause I didn't have a tape in the tape deck and I'm running all over the place like a chicken with their head cut off, how I'm gonna record this and of course that was back in the days when 'Video Soul' came on at nine o'clock and came on again at two in the morning.  So, I stayed up, had three tape decks running and made sure that I had that thing recorded, you know, so I could have that for posterity.
Story_ID: 192146
Speaker 1: What's your favorite photograph that you've taken?
Speaker 2: I have several, but I think probably my favorite is the one of Muhammad Ali doing the weigh in in 1976.  I took a picture of him leaning over the ropes taunting the press, and he just happened to have a wink.  He winked with his left eye and I'm certain I'm the only one that got that moment of him winking and but I even didn't know.  I didn't know at the time that I had it because being short, just like everybody in the press was either standing on something or just happened to be taller than me.  So I held the camera above my head and in holding it above my head I just shot and I didn't know what I had until I got home and developed the film and there was this great picture.  So, sometimes even if you're a professional, sometimes you're more lucky than good because that was clearly just luck, you know, I mean I had, it was in focus and everything like that, but it was just a great, great shot and it was just lucky that I got it the way I did, and I gave that picture to him some fifteen years later.
Speaker 1: And tell me a little bit about what you feel your greatest accomplishment has been?
Speaker 2: Actually my greatest accomplishment has been helping to raise my daughter [Kellee Baker] in entrepreneurial spirit where she has gone on to develop that spirit in real estate where she is doing quite well, right now while she's in law school.  And I think that kind of is my greatest accomplishment because you can't judge it by who you photograph or what you've done or what even kind of fame comes to you, it's all based on, as far as I'm concerned, how you pass it on.  The book was an accomplishment and it showed me I could do something if I put my mind to it, but I think being able to present an example to the next generation, especially a generation that comes from you, and show them some history.  See my daughter had some history that like in a lot of black families it's--there is sometimes no history, there's nothing to pass on, there's no family crest, I mean that's like Tupac [Shakur] says, most black families the first person who is successful in the family is usually the first person who is successful in the family, I mean there's not like there was something passed on to them, the family crest or the you know the family history, you know something rich or the heirlooms or something like that generally didn't start with the person who experienced that success.  So, for me to be able to pass that on to her and, and use that as a foundation that she can use to say okay well my parents did this and my dad was recognized for this or that and the other and he did it his way and on his own, that to me is my favorite accomplishment.
Story_ID: 192147
Speaker 1: And how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: As somebody who, who took the gifts that were given and utilized them and made something out of it that others can share and that would be a permanent remembrance of not only my experiences, but the experiences of people who I've photographed whether it'd been a celebrity or whether it'd been a wedding or a family outing or just a chance picture of someone, if they got it and they can use it as something to point to that was special in their life then it would become special to me.  So to me being able to share my work and share my work in a way where it becomes memories for other people is really the best accomplishment you can have.
Speaker 1: So, would you like to be remembered as a celebrity photographer or just a photographer?
Speaker 2: No, I just wanna be remembered as somebody who took advantage of the gifts that were given to me and used them to benefit myself as well as others and of course as a celebrity photographer you know, you know once, sometimes you're a celebrity today, and the scourge of the earth tomorrow, I mean, ask O.J. [Simpson].  You know one minute he's running through the airport for Hertz [Corporation] and the next minute he's running down the highway in that [Ford] Bronco, so you go from good to bad and sometimes back to good.  I mean look at [HistoryMaker] Marion Barry.  I mean, look what he's done, I'm sorry I didn't get that picture in that hotel (laughter) 'cause I know I could with my camera and that film I could have gotten a lot better than the FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation] spending all those millions to get that bad tape.
Story_ID: 192148
Speaker 1: So, who haven't you photographed yet that you'd still like to and why?
Speaker 2: Okay, well I haven't photographed Aretha Franklin.  I'd love to photograph her.  I haven't photographed Oprah [Winfrey].  Now my brother [HM Donald Baker] has photographed Oprah and I've photographed Stedman [Graham] years ago.  As a matter of fact, he's in my book ['Solid Images: A Collection of Memories'], but I never got a chance to photograph Oprah, but at some point hopefully I'll be able to do that maybe when we get on her show when we do our next book.
Speaker 1: And when is the next book?
Speaker 2: Well, we're actually working on it now.  My brother and I are trying to compile all the images.  We've pulled some images, but you know the problem is we're constantly doing new stuff and so there's some people you just gotta get in the book.  So, it's almost as if it wasn't meant for us to get it out this year, so our expectation is we plan during the winter and stuff that we're gonna start putting things together and really get this thing out next year.  As a matter of fact, I've talked to a couple of potential investors already about it because we really wanna do it really nice.  We really wanna do a nice hard cover and we want it to be like a history document as well as a coffee table book.  So, we don't want it just to be a coffee table book.  We'd like to get it in the school systems and stuff like that as well.
Story_ID: 192149
Speaker 1: And, has there ever been a photograph that you regretted taking?
Speaker 2: Well, the closest I can say to that is I took a picture for a cover of Players magazine of Linda Greene, who was Peaches, the second Peaches of Peaches and Greene, Peaches and Herb, I'm sorry.  Because, only because--I didn't regret taking the picture, I regretted that we published it because she did her own makeup and I think it was probably on one of those days when her limited makeup skills were probably magnified because it was horrible.  It was really--and I didn't know how to do makeup and I really had to, that's really what got me into learning how to do makeup because her manager suggested, you gotta learn how to do makeup.  Of course, when I was growing up you equated or mis-associated guys doing makeup with like Mr. Earl [ph.] or somebody (laughter), some guy that wasn't, you know, manly.  So, I avoided doing makeup, but I eventually had to go and learn how to do it because it was critical that, especially a lot of the models that I worked with even today that I know how to do it, because that cover is one of the covers I don't show people.  You know, it's like the relative you don't talk about.  That was one of those things you don't call out and say oh yeah look at this, I mean, she had that Cleopatra look, and it just looked like maybe she might have been on something, that day (laughter).  So, we don't talk about that one too much.
Speaker 1: Do you ever wish you would have chosen a different career path?
Speaker 2: No, no, because I know this is what I was meant to do.  I mean, 'cause I do it so well and so easily in it, it's blending of my affinity for people and my love for working with people.  I mean everything I've ever done, every job I've ever had I've serviced other people, so it's what, it's who I am is what I'm meant to be, and so I never looked to be anything else than that.  I mean even in cinema, when I took cinematography in college I did a few short films.  I didn't like it, the process was too long for me.  It was too much work involved, too many other people had their hand in the pie, and so I knew I didn't have control.  And so I think the fact also that not many black cinematographers and independent filmmakers were getting any work back in the '70s [1970s] when I finished.  That--I said, well let me stick with what I know how to do, and what apparently I'm meant to do, and it's worked out.  And of course if I'd known about 'em early, mid '80s [1980s], that music videos were gonna be really big, maybe I might have stuck in it for the money and the opportunity, but of course who knew, but it wasn't meant for me that was meant for somebody else.
Story_ID: 192150
Speaker 1: And even though, you know, you are known, you and your brother [HM Donald Baker], as the photographer of the celebrities in many circles, especially prominent people, especially here in the Washington D.C. area, is your goal to someday be--for the world to know you and to know your work?
Speaker 2: No, I don't think that's important, because all of the billions or so people that are in the world, I don't know if there is a billion or two people in the world, that might be just China, but I think personally no matter how well you're known that the most important people to be known to are your friends and your family.  And I think those people whose lives you impact in a positive way, and there may only be a few people because basically there's--I don't think there's any way that you could ever--you may be known by people, but to me being known by people is having interacted with them.  You know it's like there are people who can say they, I know of someone, but that doesn't mean they know you.  And if you're known by so many people, there's no real benefit to you because they don't really get to know you.  They get to know you through the product you produce or whatever, or maybe they see an interview or something or hear something you say, but that doesn't really get to know you.  So, you don't really, that knowing or being known to me isn't that important when you get outside of a certain sphere of friends and family and clients.  I think being recognized as a person who delivers a quality product, a quality service and who's consistent if you're gonna, if I wanna be known around the world, I'd like to be known for that or recognized for that, but as far as being a celebrity I never put my stock in that because I've photographed too many celebrities over the years and the worst thing that you can do is be a has-been and approach somebody and say, "Do you know who I used to be?"  You know I never wanna be that person who used to be somebody, you know, so I'm still who I always was.
