Speaker 1: Hence the black archives?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, yes, yes.
Story_ID: 111449
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, we'll move into your family history right now.  Can you give me your mom's full name, including her maiden name?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Her name was Dorothy Catherine Johnson Jenkins McKellar, M-C, capital K-E-L-L-A-R.
Speaker 1: And when was she born?  Like, just the year.
Speaker 2: January 11th, 1909.
Speaker 1: And what do you know about her childhood and her background?  Anything--do you know anything about her childhood?
Speaker 2: Oh yes, she's one of seven children, five of which were, five of whom were born right here in Miami [Florida], in Miami's Colored Town [now Overtown].  Miami was incorporated in 1896.  Our family, my mother's parents moved from Key West, Florida after leaving Harbour Island in the Bahamas.  They settled in Miami's Colored Town in 1943.  When they settled in 1903, they brought two children with them, Samuel and Elaine.  And the other five children were born in Colored Town.  My grandmother was on her way to Atlanta, to Jacksonville or to Atlanta.  She was--had read when she was a child in the Bahamas that black people in America were doing well in Jacksonville, Florida and Atlanta, Georgia.  So she was really headed to one of those places.  But when the first two children were born in Key West and then they got to Miami and five children were born, that kind of stopped her in her tracks.  But it's interesting that the children subsequently several of them did go to school in both Jacksonville and Atlanta.  So I'm sure my grandmother was behind that.
Speaker 1: Now what do you know about your mom's life in Colored Town in--?
Speaker 2: Miami's early Colored Town?
Speaker 1: In early--yeah in the early turn of the century?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Well, again the family was originally from the Bahamas.  My grandmother was supposed to have said that the trip coming from the Bahamas to Key West was so rocky that she never wanted to go back again.  It was such a small, ding, dinghy that she was in and the waters evidently were unsettled.  And so they did come to the states.  She never went back again.  And she became a part--she wanted so much to become a part of the, of Americans.  She wanted to be Americanized because they were ostracized so that--
Speaker 1: Because they were Bahamian?
Speaker 2: Because they were Bahamian, yes and that was always a problem.  I know my mom said that children would laugh at them sometimes and black children in the community.
Speaker 1: Oh what, because their accents or clothes or--?
Speaker 2: Because of their--well my mother and her siblings were born here.  But the food and the culture that my grandparents brought with them was something that sometimes the American children, not understanding that we're all a part of the same culture and we're different because our ancestors were left at different ports and that's how the cultures changed.  Not understanding that, there were many instances unfortunately where they were ostracized.  And so that was something that was--that my mother told me at a very early age.  But she seemed to have enjoyed life.  She was a phys--she became a physical education teacher and she loved dance and basketball.  And I think she had hoped that I would go into that same line of work. I learned to enjoy them and became an advocate, but certainly that was not my style.  But she passed away in February of 2002, at the--
Speaker 1: Oh I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: --age of what, ninety-three or so.  And--but she was a wonderful person.  Everybody says that about their mother I would hope.  But she was so supportive.  She was so encouraging as she realized what I was doing.  And as I realized what I was doing cause I wasn't sure at first.  But much of what I did, I did because of her and her family.  When I was born, my mother, her two sisters--
Speaker 1: When--and when were you born?
Speaker 2: Thursday, December 31st, 1942, at Christian Hospital in Miami's Colored Town.
Story_ID: 111450
Speaker 1: When I was born my mother [Dorothy Johnson Jenkins McKellar], her two sisters and four brothers were college graduates, which was a rarity even for white people in, not only in the Jim Crow South but I'm sure in the North, in the West and all around.
Speaker 2: And where did they all go to school?
Speaker 1: The first four of them had to go away to high school because there was no high school provided for black children.  My reach--research in later years showed that the first high--white high school started about four years after Miami [Florida] became a city.  But the first black senior high school did not open until thirty-one years after Miami became a city, after the black leadership complained and really put up a fuss.  Before that they were told that black children did not need a formal education.  Finish eighth grade or tenth grade was enough, and they could get out and work because biologic--they were supposed to be biologically inferior and blacks would never be more than servants for others.  My grandmother and many other mothers and fathers did not believe that and so the eldest child, S.H. Johnson, who later became the first black radiologist in South Florida, was sent to the Florida Baptist Academy in Jacksonville, Florida about 1911.  And it was there that he became roommates with Howard Thurman.
Speaker 2: Oh, from Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia]?
Speaker 1: Yes.  And--
Speaker 2: But that was the Florida--?
Speaker 1: The Florida Baptist Academy--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --which has now relocated to Miami and is Florida Memorial University [Miami Gardens, Florida].
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: For a time it was--relocated to Live Oak, Florida but ultimately since the '60s [1960s], it's been here in Miami.
Speaker 2: Oh you know what, may I get your grandparents' names, your maternal grandparents?
Speaker 1: Yes, Ida Ellen Roberts Johnson.
Speaker 2: And your grandfather?
Speaker 1: Samuel Davis Johnson--David Johnson.  And I had a father (laughter).
Speaker 2: Okay, oh yeah we're going to get to that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We start with the--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --maternal side then--
Speaker 1: Yeah, maternal side.
Speaker 2: And do you know their birth years--
Speaker 1: I don't.
Speaker 2: --for your grandparents?
Speaker 1: Yes, I don't--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --remember those.
Story_ID: 111451
Speaker 1: Since you want to talk about your dad, well let's talk about your dad.  What was his name?
Speaker 2: Melvin Adolf Jenkins.
Speaker 1: And where was he born?
Speaker 2: I'm not sure.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I think he was born right here.  I think he was born in Homestead, Florida which is a community south of Miami [Florida], right here in Dade County [Miami-Dade County].
Speaker 1: Okay.  And do you know what year he was born?
Speaker 2: No, I don't.
Speaker 1: You have a rough idea?
Speaker 2: Between Nineteen-eight [1908] and Nineteen-eleven [1911].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I would think.
Speaker 1: And what do you know about his childhood here in Dade County?
Speaker 2: Very little.  My mother [Dorothy Johnson Jenkins McKellar] and father were divorced when I was two years old unfortunately and I spent--except for some visiting days with my dad, I spent all of my time with my mom and her family.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My father was killed on the--he was a cook.  He did go to Tuskegee Institute [now Tuskegee University in Tuskegee, Alabama] for I think two years, and then he became a cook on the Champion, the FEC [Florida East Coast Railway] train that ran from Miami to New York.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And he was killed when the Champion had a wreck, April 21st, I guess it was 1953.
Speaker 1: Oh okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So you were very young.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Oh yes, you were just what, ten, eleven years old.
Speaker 2: Yes, um-hmm.
Speaker 1: Now did you know your father's side of the family at all?
Speaker 2: Several of his sisters and brothers, Benjamin Jenkins who lived in Boston with his wife, Sis, Australia Jenkins and my Aunt Mattie [ph.] also lived in Boston and an Aunt Ethel Holt who ultimately moved to Los Angeles, California and went into real estate there.  But I knew Uncle Ben best of all and in fact he is very much a part of my story.
Story_ID: 111452
Speaker 1: Growing up, my mother [Dorothy Johnson Jenkins McKellar] wanted to be sure that I had everything. I'm an only child.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And she grew up with six siblings.  I don't know that they wanted for very much.  My grandmother [Ida Roberts Johnson] was a washerwoman and my grandfather--
Speaker 2: Your Grandma Ida, right?
Speaker 1: My Grandmother Ida, yes.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Ida Ellen, and I'm named for her.  My name is--my full name is Dorothy Ellen Jenkins Fields.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: In the south you know it's important to carry on those names and so the first born [Field's first born] was Catherine named for my mother--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --Dorothy Catherine, yes.
Speaker 2: That makes sense.
Speaker 1: And Edda is named for her dad, Eddie Fields, yes.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But my mother--what was I going to say?
Speaker 2: Oh you were saying that your grandmother was a washerwoman.
Speaker 1: A washer woman, yes and my grandfather Sam D., as he was known, was an insurance man.  Prior to that in the Bahamas, he was a sponger.
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Diving--
Speaker 1: He was an excellent swimmer and he was one of the men who would dive into the water and go deep and get, harvest the sponges and bring them to the surface, yes.
Speaker 2: That is so cool.
Speaker 1: Yes, and so I learned the song (singing in another language) or sponge is money.  And I've heard someone singing it and I, I started singing it one day and my grandmother was very, very upset.  And I did not realize that the spongers (foreign language) were the women who would go to the spongers for their money before the spongers got home, brought it home (Laughter).  So you never know how those kinds of things happen.
Speaker 2: (Unclear).
Speaker 1: And again as a child, I was just picking up a tune and really got bopped in the mouth because--and she didn't think to say why.  And of course I was too young really to explain and it wasn't until much later.  In fact, I asked my Aunt Roberta I guess just about five years ago about that song and she said oh, you didn't know?
Speaker 2: You're, and you're a grown woman and you didn't even know?
Speaker 1: Yes, yes.  But it stayed on my mind.  You never know how children, what will impress a child.  And that's why it's so very careful--important to be careful with what you say and what you do.  What you do is so much more impressionable sometimes than what you say.  But both are important with children.  And my mom was a teacher as was her siblings.  They were--we called them a family of teachers because they all were--my grandmother was a teacher.  Although she did not have a formal education, she was a Sunday school teacher and of course with seven children, she was a teacher.  And she was an orator and spoke as a part of the [Masonic] Lodges which were very important in the early days.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 111453
Speaker 1: You know, we were talking off-camera earlier and to go back to your mom's [Dorothy Johnson Jenkins McKellar] education, but you didn't say in particular where your mom went to school in Atlanta [Georgia]. So can we talk a little about that?
Speaker 2: Okay.  She did all of her elementary and high school work here [Miami, Florida].  She was in the second class to finish from Booker T. Washington, Senior High School [Miami, Florida].  Again, that was the first senior high school in Miami-Dade County.  Children came from as far south as Key West [Florida] and as far north as Pompano [Beach, Florida] in order to finish high school because again there was no high school, because of Jim, the Jim Crow laws.  And there were no high schools for children so she was in the second class to graduate from Booker T.  From there she went to Florida A&M College.  We now know it as Florida A&M University [FAMU, Tallahassee, Florida]. Her older sister, Elaine Natalie, Elaine Johnson Natalie, was the one who went to Spelman [College, Atlanta, Georgia] for high school and the second sister, Roberta Johnson Thompson went to Tuskegee [Institute, now Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama] for high school.  Brother Samuel, S.H. Johnson who later became the first black radiologist in South Florida, went to Florida A&M when it was a college for high school.  The second was Fredrick Johnson who went to Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia] for high school and then college.  It was interesting because when he went to Morehouse for high school and they asked him what was his classification he said, I'm a junior.  So they thought he meant a junior in college until they got his records.
Speaker 1: Like, uh--?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Go back.
Speaker 1: That is too funny, wow.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: You know what, now I don't even think I knew that Morehouse had a high school.  I knew that Spelman did.
Speaker 2: Spelman--well all of them did, all the HBCUs [Historically black colleges and universities].
Speaker 1: (Unclear) they had to.
Speaker 2: That's a part of the history of the HB, HBCUs that really is not told.  And when they keep saying, do we still need them?  We need them yes now because they were the ones who provided the education, the high school education.  Yes, we'll have to write that down somewhere.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: In the complete absence--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and outright neglect--
Speaker 2: Yes, absolutely.
Speaker 1: --in major cities everywhere.  That's--it's really interesting to think that a parent would have to send their child, have to send their child away.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: I mean the distance between Miami and Atlanta is what, like--more than, okay more than 500 miles.
Speaker 2: Oh definitely, on yes, um-hmm.
Speaker 1: And traveling then--
Speaker 2: Yes oh yes, not the superhighways that we have now, of course not.
Speaker 1: And dirt roads and--
Speaker 2: Then the first child went at age eleven to Jacksonville to the Florida Baptist Academy because again, like when my grandmother [Ida Roberts Johnson] worked for white people in the Bahamas, my understanding is that she would read the newspapers as a girl and--that they would throw out.  And in reading the newspaper she would see where black people were doing well in Jacksonville and Atlanta.  So her wish was to get married, come to the states, have babies and live in Jacksonville or Atlanta so they could do well, and they did extremely well.  When I was born, by the time I was born I had two uncles who were doctors.  Well one was already a medical doctor.  The other one the next year finished Howard--I'm sorry, finished Meharry [Medical College, Nashville, Tennessee].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I'm thinking, I can see in my mind's eye, he and his brother on the front of the newspaper.  One was finishing Meharry in 1943, and the other one finishing law at Howard [University School of Law, Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 1: That's pretty impressive.
Speaker 2: Yes.  So growing up I had two uncles who were doctors in the Miami that, the Colored Town [now Overtown, neighborhood in Miami, Florida] that you never hear about.
Story_ID: 111454
Speaker 1: Where is--well where was Colored Town [now Overtown, neighborhood in Miami, Florida] in--where is it--I can't speak.
Speaker 2: It's--
Speaker 1: Where can I find its parameters today?
Speaker 2: South parameter would be Northwest Sixth Street.  The west I guess would be I-95 Expressway.  The east would be First Avenue and the north would be Northwest 21st Street.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: And it's the same--Overtown. It's now known as Overtown--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --when people moved from the area, not just moved but were relocated because of the highway in the 60s [1960s].
Speaker 1: Okay, that's--I just wanted--
Speaker 2: They named it, we're going back Overtown, when people moved out to where we are now--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --to differentiate between going Downtown, which was the white business section and Colored Town's business section, the reference was to Overtown.
Speaker 1: Town--okay.
Speaker 2: Yes, um-hmm, cause in New York it's Uptown and--
Speaker 1: Right, Downtown, okay.
Speaker 2: Yes (unclear).
Speaker 1: That was the one, I--cause I'm like what happened to Colored Town?
Speaker 2: It's still there.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Just not--
Speaker 2: Unfortunately, in too many ways.  And I say it that way because of the neglect, of the relocation of people against their will, of the vacant land that's there and that in past decades we have--even though a lot of money has been assigned to it, the money too often has been diverted to other projects.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And there have not been enough of us interested in trying to preserve it and make it a part of the marketplace.
Speaker 1: Right, which we will get to in its--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --in its time 'cause you haven't been, even, you know been born yet so we got to get to that, so--
Story_ID: 111455
Speaker 1: Here you are born right at the start of--or the end of '42 [1942], in the middle of World War II [WWII].
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Tell me about your childhood and your neighborhood.
Speaker 2: Well at age four, my--when I was born, we lived with my grandmother [Ida Johnson Roberts] and grandfather [Samuel Johnson] and all of my mother's [Dorothy Johnson Jenkins McKellar] siblings across the street from the Lyric Theater at 159 NW 10th Street, 1004, Northwest 1st Court.  There were three houses that my grandparents owned.  And so until age four, I grew up there and then my uncle, Dr. S.H. Johnson the radiologist, found property for us in Brownsville [Florida].  Right, it was then called Brown Sub, Brown Subdivision.
Speaker 1: Brown--
Speaker 2: Subdivision, which would be northwest of Colored Town [now Overtown, neighborhood in Miami, Florida].  So that became a pocket settlement, another Colored Town.  Colored Town was wherever colored people lived and you lived in pocket settlements and enclaves because there were restrictive clauses and deeds, yeah.  It wasn't just a, an area that you selected, it was restricted clauses and deeds that limited where black people could live, yes.  And that didn't change until 1964.
Speaker 1: (Unclear).
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: So we moved there and we moved to an area, a two block area where again my uncle, the radiologist bought property for my grandmother, and his sisters and brothers bought their property around in the same block.  So the entire family moved from Miami's Colored Town, Overtown to Miami's Colored Town, Brown Sub.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm really learning a lot about Miami history.  There's a lot of name--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --name changes so okay.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Story_ID: 111456
Speaker 1: And so I went to the same school that my mother [Dorothy Johnson Jenkins McKellar] and her siblings, the older--the younger siblings attended, Booker T. Washington High School [Miami, Florida].
Speaker 2: Now where did you go for elementary school?
Speaker 1: Phyllis Wheatley Elementary School in Colored Town [now Overtown, neighborhood in Miami, Florida] because my mother was a physical education teacher there.  My Aunt Roberta was the--was a fifth grade teacher there.  My Aunt Johnna Lee Johnson was a third grade teacher there.  My Aunt Pauline, my cousin Pauline Johnson was a third grade teacher there and my father's cousin Grace Benson Albert was a principal.
Speaker 2: So you had a really tough time there?
Speaker 1: Absolutely.  And the only 'F' I ever made in school--came close with a 'D' at Spelman [College, Atlanta, Georgia] in French.  But the only 'F' that I ever made ever in school was an 'F' in physical education--
Speaker 2: But wait, your mom taught--
Speaker 1: The teacher, the physical education teacher was Dorothy Catherine Johnson Jenkins McKellar, my mother.  She had said that when they did forward rolls and tumbling, because she just knew that I was going to be this petite child 'cause she was petite and had an hour glass shape.  I even put that in her obituary because it was true.  And it was pride and joy that she had--so she expected this petite child, especially a girl.  It's a girl so it's going to be petite and it's--she's going to be dainty and she's going to be able to do all these things that I do.  And as it turns out, the ball was not petite at all and my father was approximately I guess 6'2", and I guess maybe, he wasn't fat but he certainly was 280 pounds.
Speaker 2: Wow.
Speaker 1: So he was a good size.  So obviously my physical side came from my dad.  And I always thought I was going to be very tall and as a young child that was--would have been fun but I realized as a teenage girl, being that tall would not, wouldn't have been to my advantage.  At any rate, in I guess third or fourth grade or maybe fifth grade, I don't know, the physical education teacher said that we had six weeks of tumbling and she was sure that if she structured it like that and said it was a requirement that all the children would do a forward roll and that she'd finally make her point and her daughter would then become, would have swallowed the magic bullet and would have become the petite tumbler that she wanted me to be.  And I just didn't do it.  I still have not done a forward roll.  And she announced to all the children that if you did not do a forward roll you would get an 'F.'  You would earn--she wasn't going to give it to you, you would earn an 'F.'
Speaker 2: Earn an 'F.'
Speaker 1: Yes.  And so showdown, showdown time came and I just could not do it and would not do it, and so I got an 'F.'  And of course all--cause she had announced it publicly so all, everybody is waiting to see and I got my card and got home--
Speaker 2: And--
Speaker 1: --and she said as she always did, did you get your card, your report card today?  And I'm thinking now this lady is really just, you know, trying me.  I'm thinking this to myself.  And--
Speaker 2: You know I don't want to break up your story but we're about to--this tape is going to end in a couple of seconds so we'll finish that on our next tape.  But it was so good, so it's a cliffhanger.
Story_ID: 110028
Speaker 1: So our cliffhanger, you come home from school, your mother [Dorothy Johnson Jenkins McKellar] asks you, have you--?
Speaker 2: My--for my report card and so I gave it to her.  And in dismay she said, you got an 'F.' Why did you get an 'F'?  Playing the mother role, you know.
Speaker 1: Not that a teacher--
Speaker 2: That's correct.
Speaker 1: --even put 'F' down on your card?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, because I earned it for not following instructions.  But it was an important lesson.
Speaker 1: What was that lesson?  Please tell me.  Was it, do what your mother said?
Speaker 2: Yes, well that too, and that you have roles to play.  And she was accustomed to that because her brothers had always taught her.  The brothers who were older always taught the other children.  They taught them math, they taught them all of the subjects, formerly as their teachers in school.
Speaker 1: (BRIEF INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 2: So that was, that has been very important to me to understand different roles that you have at different times.
Story_ID: 110029
Speaker 1: So who are some mentors that you recall from your elementary or high school days?
Speaker 2: Start with Aunt Bert, Mrs. Roberta Johnson Thompson, who was my mother's [Dorothy Johnson Jenkins McKellar] second sister, was my fifth grade teacher and Aunt Bert was quite a literary person.  She saw to it that we read 'Little Women' [Louisa May Alcott], 'Little Men' [Louisa May Alcott], 'Black Beauty,' Ebony Magazine, which is where we got our black history from.  But she was quite a community and family historian herself.  And the fact that she was a graduate of Tuskegee--well she actually went to high school at Tuskegee [Institute, now Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama].  She graduated from Florida A&M College [now Florida A&M University, FAMU, Tallahassee, Florida].  But because she was at Tuskegee and took a picture once with Booker T. Washington, she was in a group or--the scientist.
Speaker 1: Oh, George Washington Carver?
Speaker 2: George Washington Carver, she's on a picture with--not Booker T. Washington because Booker T. Washington died in 1915.  But with George Washington Carver, was really something that she was very proud of.  And she taught handwriting, which was something that I never seem to get to her satisfaction.  And to bring that forward, she died just a year--seven months before my mother did and Aunt Bert was at age ninety-seven.  Aunt Bert was really, really--
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: --aiming for a hundred and it's not her fault that she did not make it because she was determined to do it.  When she was in hospice just two weeks before her death, she looked at something that I had written.  Well first of all, we were--I was talking to the nurse, the hospice nurse and Aunt Bert sat up in the bed and she said, that, that should have been an adverb.  And I said Aunt Bert I thought you were sick.  Well, I'm not that sick.
Speaker 1: That she could allow this--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --this poor language to be--
Speaker 2: That's an adverb  (Laughter) Okay.
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: And then while she was sitting up, as weak as she was 'cause she was very frail, as weak as she was she said, and I hope that when you are signing my checks and writing my checks and paying my bills that you are using your best penmanship, you know that's some unfinished business that we have  (Laughter).
Speaker 1: Ninety-seven?
Speaker 2: In hospice.
Speaker 1: Well--
Speaker 2: At ninety-five, two years before, it was the last time she did her income tax 'cause she always did her own everything, and she did her own [Form] 1040.  And usually she would do it and call me to come pick it up and I'd make a copy and whatever.  This time took a little bit longer and I'm thinking, well ninety-five, I guess she's wavering a little bit.  So I called, Aunt Bert, how you doing--cause again, we lived in the same block.  So she said, I'm, I'm--it's taking me a little more time than I thought, but I'll get back to you.  So a couple days later she called me and said you can come pick it up now.  I'm ready.  And she signed it as the preparer.  So I said what happened?  She said--and she didn't say anything.  She said, you know she just gave it to me.  So I took it to an accountant to look at.  He said oh, I see that your aunt found out that they changed the schedule for her tax bracket.  So she had read the new regs [regulations] (laughter)--
Speaker 1: Adjusted--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Wow--
Story_ID: 110030
Speaker 1: But what did you learn from her [Fields' aunt, Roberta Johnson Thompson] besides that you were inadequate in your penmanship and misused adverbs?
Speaker 2: All of them, I mean I, as a child I was just always in awe of them.  At a very early age I realized that these were special people.  My mother [Dorothy Johnson Jenkins McKellar] and my stepfather and I lived in the same house with my grandmother [Ida Roberts Johnson].  My grandfather [Samuel Johnson] died in 1944.  So we were--so I grew up with my mother and my grandmother and her wisdom.  And the fact that her four boys and other two girls always came to her home as soon as they left work, they would come by and--I'm sure to see what was cooking on the stove--but also to see how she was doing and to talk about their day.  And I thought for a long time that the Alpha [Phi Alpha Fraternity] hymn was the Star-Spangled Banner and the Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia] hymn because those were the songs that I heard--
Speaker 1: All the time.
Speaker 2: --my uncles sing all the time, yes.  Yes, yes, yes.
Speaker 1: That Morehouse hymn is very moving.
Speaker 2: It is.  It is.  So I was--I never thought that I would be able to do anything, I mean a consciousness, I remember being conscious about all of these extraordinary people who seem to be doing a lot of things.  And I just thought as a youngster, well I'll never be able to do half of what they're doing, but I would like to write their story.
Story_ID: 110031
Speaker 1: Just finishing up with Aunt Bert [Fields' aunt, Roberta Johnson Thompson], I guess.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: What--you just--we were talking about how vital she was in your life--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --and how influential.
Speaker 1: And all of them.  And again as a child it was clear to me at an early age that the, that the people who were around me who were my family were not only important to the family but they were doing things in the community, from the things that they would say when they would come to see my grandmother [Ida Roberts Johnson] every day.  And the fact they lived--and as teenager that wasn't so much fun because, you know, if I had done something--yes, yes.
Story_ID: 110032
Speaker 1: But it was an exciting childhood.  At Phyllis Wheatley Elementary [Miami, Florida], I was very active in activities.  At Booker T. [Washington High School, Miami, Florida], I was on the newspaper staff and in the band.
Speaker 2: What instrument did you play?
Speaker 1: Bells, the easy way out.  My cousins played clarinet.  Jewel and Ken played clarinet and Leo played flute.  And I didn't want to learn all those instruments, all those, all that music, all those notes but I wanted to be in the band with them so I decided to play the glockenspiel, known as bells.
Speaker 2: Do you still remember some songs?  Can you tap some out?
Speaker 1: No (laughter).
Story_ID: 110033
Speaker 1: Well you know, you were talking about your home and your grandmother [Ida Roberts Johnson].  What are some of--in thinking back on that time what are some sights--or sounds or smells that conjure up some memories for you?
Speaker 2: Well, we lived right off Second Avenue which was known as Little Broadway and we were on Second Avenue and Tenth Street.  All the homes then were Bahamian style so we had a porch and I remember going--I remember Easter-time for instance.  My mother [Dorothy Johnson Jenkins McKellar] would always hide socks and ribbon and candy for me and eggs of course to go out and to get Easter eggs.  Again as an only child although I had cousins who lived, some of them lived in the houses very near, me but others lived away so a lot of the time I was alone.  But my mother wanted to be sure that I was well-balanced, that I had friends and that I learned to play by myself.  And that has taken me a long way even as a little girl, eighteen months old I guess, because my mother was working full time.  I went to the hairdresser and got my hair shampooed and I sat in Mrs. Theodora White Cooper's [ph.] lap and she shampooed my hair and straightened it.
Speaker 1: With a hot comb?
Speaker 2: With a hot comb, oh yes.  Oh yeah, well that was before permanents.
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: Oh, sure, so I always had that and I always had stiff ribbon bows and large ribbon bows.  My Aunt Elaine, Mrs. Elaine Adderly was a home economics teacher at Booker T. Washington Senior High School.
Speaker 1: Can you spell her last name for me?
Speaker 2: Adderly, A-D-D-E-R-L-Y.
Speaker 1: Okay, thank you.
Speaker 2: And I'll have to find a picture of her with the children.  This was the first high school, senior high school black or white to have a childcare program in the school.  And so that was an important part of growing up before there was daycare and Head Start and all of that.  And she--
Speaker 1: She understood the importance of this.
Speaker 2: Yes.  And then she had--my aunt had a child, Leo Adderly, who needed childcare and so she started with him.  He later became a county court judge and is retired now and lives in that same block, yes, in the family homestead.
Story_ID: 110034
Speaker 1: Well you know what, I--just for people who aren't familiar with South Florida architecture and Miami [Florida] architecture, can you describe what a Bahamian-style house is a little bit?
Speaker 2: Wooden with a porch and the windows are arranged so that you get a breeze through the house without air conditioning.  And the ball--they have balustrades in the front with the porches so that, that gives it a very airy and sort of gingerbread look.  Many of them are built up off the ground or sit on cement blocks.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, off the ground.
Speaker 1: Now, I know if--one interview I had earlier this week that said we had a Bahamian kitchen and--which was outside.  So was your home--did--where was the kitchen?
Speaker 2: No, our plumbing was always inside.  That's one of the things--my understanding is that when my grandmother [Ida Roberts Johnson] was thinking about coming to the states, we already had family like [HM] Thelma Anderson Gibson that you interviewed the other day.  She's a part of our extended family from Harbour Island [Bahamas].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They were already here but they settled in Coconut Grove [neighborhood in Miami, Florida].  My grandmother said that she didn't want to live in the sticks.  She didn't want to live in the wilderness.  She wanted to live in the city so that's why they came directly to Miami's Colored Town, Overtown.  Well, it was Colored Town then.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes, and settled there.  And it wasn't that much more developed than Coconut Grove but it had businesses.  And the fact is, it was adjacent to Downtown Miami [Florida] and I think that's why it had, it grew so well and so fast because, I mean adjacent, I mean just across the railroad tracks.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So that a lot of the things that were done Downtown could easily be done in Colored Town.
Speaker 1: Okay, so for you, you particularly remember just--yeah, I don't think maybe we really said--
Speaker 2: Okay, so that's--
Speaker 1: --what sights, sounds and smells.
Speaker 2: All right, so that--well let me get back to the kitchen so that--I said all of that to say that because we lived so close to Downtown and in fact, Tenth Street the actual street that the house, my grandmother's house faced went from Biscayne Boulevard all the way to Seventh Avenue which was a main thoroughfare.  When some of the other streets, all of the streets in Colored Town didn't go from White Town all the way through.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I think that's why they may have gotten plumbing before they got it in other places even in Overtown, and certainly before they got plumbing in Coconut Grove--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --because we were so close to Downtown.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 110035
Speaker 1: And so the sights again would be the house and the porch and the things that we did.  The smell would be the hair.
Speaker 2: Cooking hair?
Speaker 1: We said it, cooking hair.  No, no, we said it.  I just wasn't explicit.  So you want me to bring it out?
Speaker 2: Okay, well yeah because you know--
Speaker 1: The smell of burning hair.
Speaker 2: Okay, there you go.
Speaker 1: I remember this from, since, from eighteen months or so.  That's not nice.
Speaker 2: But it's true.
Speaker 1: Of course it's true.
Speaker 2: My mom did the same thing.
Speaker 1: Sure, sure, sure, and high school the band playing.  I was both in the concert band and the marching band doing the same thing playing bells every time.  You know they'd point to me I'd (gestures hitting the bell), but had lots of fun.  And you had asked me earlier about mentors and I talked about Aunt Bert [Roberta Johnson Thompson] and the whole family of seven and my grandmother [Ida Roberts Johnson].  And in high school, Mrs. Marian Shannon, Marian Harry Shannon [ph.], a graduate of Hampton Univ--Hampton College, now Hampton University [Hampton, Virginia], who was and still is member of Zeta Phi Beta Sorority.  My mother was a charter member of Beta Tau and I joined a graduate chapter.  Since the time I was at Spelman [College, Atlanta, Georgia], Dr. Manley [Dr. Albert E. Manley who was president said young ladies, Spelman is a sorority so you don't need to have that division of those individual groups.
Speaker 2: Amongst you.
Speaker 1: Yeah, among you, that's correct.  So we accepted it at the time but I understand my sisters later on did what they should have done before and that is you know, bring the sororities in.  That would not have stopped our family--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --but--
Speaker 2: So actually that's a perfect segue.
Story_ID: 110036
Speaker 1: So you're at Booker T. [Washington High School, Miami, Florida]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: It's time for you to go to college.  How old were you in your senior year?
Speaker 2: Seventeen, I guess.  I--
Speaker 1: So that was 19--?
Speaker 2: Well, I was born in--December 31st, the last day of the year, that's New Year's Eve.
Speaker 1: Right, right.  So that--no, that's why it throws you off you off--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --in terms of where you are in school?
Speaker 2: But my mother saw to it and my--I told you my cousin was a principal so I went to school as if I was six years old earlier that year.  But I can't gloss over the teachers at Booker T. Washington because they took pride in all of us.  They were concerned about us.  Mrs. Marian Shannon [ph.] was the sponsor for journalism and I never thought about writing, but she didn't want to hear it.  She and my mother were sorority sisters and she knew about my family and she thought that I had potential.  I guess she was the first person out of the family who ever personally took an interest in me and said you can be something.  Because I had already concluded that I couldn't.
Speaker 1: Really?
Speaker 2: Yes, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Now, why was that?
Speaker 2: Because again seeing so many accomplished, that everyone in the family was so accomplished, certainly I would not be able to be that smart.  So I decided the best thing I could do was to write their story, and--
Speaker 1: So you, at that time you--what were your aspirations for yourself?  Where did you see yourself or did you?
Speaker 2: No, I really did not.  But in high school, again Mrs. Shannon took interest in me and through the journalism class.  And I like to travel, so the journalism class went to Tallahassee [Florida] twice a year, so hey that's great.  I get to travel.  We had--we were then in a group called Allied Youth, which was Youth Against Smoking and Drinking.  Drugs were not in.
Speaker 1: That wasn't even a--?
Speaker 2: No, it was tobacco and alcohol that was the big thing.  And they went to Buck Hill Falls, Pennsylvania every year and it was Mrs. Blanche Dean [ph.] who was a sponsor and she was my homeroom teacher.  And she said Jenkins, sign up for this.  And I said, what do they do Mrs. Dean?  She said it's against tobacco and alcohol and we go to a conference in Pennsylvania.  Where do I sign?  I was ready to go.  It was there in the national conference that we met--and this was a conference for black and white children, we met Penney.  J.C. Penney [James Cash Penney] was the sponsor and he would come every year and he would give--and we'd all line up at the end, 'cause he was the keynote speaker and he'd give each of us a penny.  And he would say, now if you save this--he was in his nineties--if you save this by the time you get to be my age, you'll be a millionaire.  And we thought yeah, right.  This, and then money during the year, save it and you'll have it.  You'll have money.  You'll be rich.  And we never believed him and then of course we would not have, but we could have had more than we have now--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --if we had not only saved it, but invested it.  And so travel has been a very good part, a very important part of my growing up.
Story_ID: 110037
Speaker 1: But before I leave high school [Booker T. Washington High School, Miami, Florida], I have to go back to elementary school [Phyllis Wheatley Elementary School, Miami, Florida].  And I guess about age--right after my grandmother [Ida Roberts Johnson] died and my father [Melvin Jenkins] was killed within two years of each other--
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: --one in '52 [1952], and one in '53 [1953], and I was very, very depressed.  And my mother [Dorothy Johnson Jenkins McKellar] was thinking about going to graduate school.  At the time black children--black teachers throughout the South were paid to go to graduate school out of their state because of Jim Crow laws and customs.  The State of Florida paid black teachers to go out of the state.  They would pay your tuition as long as you could prove that the curriculum at Florida A&M [University, FAMU, Tallahassee, Florida] did not have what you want.  Well, that was easy.  So she was a physical education teacher.  They didn't even have a pool.  So she, with my being so unhappy having lost my grandmother and my father, she decided that this was the time for her to go to graduate school.  So she went to--very resourceful, she was all--and she was always a part of whatever professional--whatever profession she was in she was always professionally a part of it. So she was a part of the National Physical Education Teachers and she--basketball and everything.  So she knew that basketball was started at Springfield College so she wrote them and decided she'd go there.
Speaker 2: In Springfield College is--
Speaker 1: Springfield College--
Speaker 2: --in Massachusetts?
Speaker 1: --Massachusetts.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Springfield, Massachusetts.  Now my uncle Benjamin was, and Aunt Sis lived in Boston [Massachusetts] so that was a natural.  So we leave a week early and go to New York and stayed with relatives there and we always went to Broadway.
Speaker 2: Nice.
Speaker 1: Always saw the Broadway shows and went shopping for winter clothes in New York.  That was a big thing, yes.  And I had an Aunt Johnna Lee Johnson [ph.]who was there in summer school and so we would connect with her and my Godmother Georgette Campbell [ph.] actually owned a place on 125th Street.
Speaker 2: Oh!
Speaker 1: Yes.  And I know now that people from the Harlem Renaissance were there and I didn't even know it.  Yes.  So that--going there and then staying there in the summer, living in Boston and New York, my Uncle Ben was very much involved with the Cecilia Choir [Boston Cecilia].  He was a policeman but he was very much involved with and sang with the Cecilia choir in Boston.
Speaker 2: Now what's--?
Speaker 1: It's the--it wasn't a part of a church group but it was a, an oratorical group--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --that sang throughout the city.  He started singing at Booker T. Washington here in Miami's Colored Town [Florida] and then joined the choir there.   My aunt and uncle wanted to be sure, they tried to make up for what my father would have--could have done, would not have done but could have done.   And so they knew that my mother was interested in dance so they heard about Jacob's Pillow, which is a dance reparatory company in the Berkshires in Massachusetts, so that's where I spent my summers.
Speaker 2: Far away from Florida.
Speaker 1: Yes, in a very different environment and atmosphere.  And this is--I realized now this is a part of why I'm doing what I'm doing because I've live--I've had some of those, I've had these experiences.  They were part of my early childhood.  We always went to the Boston [Pops Orchestra], to Arthur Fiedler's concerts.
Speaker 2: Arthur Fiedler, wow.
Speaker 1: Yes, Arthur Fielder, yes, uh-huh, uh-huh.  Yes, yes, uh-huh.  So--and then, so she went to Springfield College and--
Speaker 2: So you would just go up in the summers?
Speaker 1: In the summers, yes.
Speaker 2: Okay, so now this--you started going there in the summers in fifty--?
Speaker 1: 'Fifty-three [1953], 'fifty-four [1954].
Speaker 2: Okay.  And when did--?
Speaker 1: I remember being there in '54 [1954].  We were there in the summer.  The Supreme Court decision for the Brown [Brown v. Board of Education] decision was May 17th of '54 [1954].  So I guess sometime in June, we were in--at Springfield, Springfield College.  I was the only black child at the camp, the Springfield College camp, and I have to find that picture among my mother's things.  And that's where I learned archery and went boating and that kind of thing.
Story_ID: 110038
Speaker 1: And then there was a camp, Camp Atwater [North Brookfield, Massachusetts].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Ah, have you heard of Camp Atwater?
Speaker 2: Historically black.
Speaker 1: Yes, yes.  My aunt found out--so while my mother [Dorothy Johnson Jenkins McKellar] was in college, my mother was always concerned about where, who would keep me and where I would be.  She didn't leave me with everybody.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: She wouldn't leave me with my godmother on 125th Street.
Speaker 2: And why not?
Speaker 1: No, she would not and my godmother was a bit cross about that.  But my mother was very, very careful as to where I was while she was doing something else 'cause we were always, always together and I certainly appreciated that.  So for a while I went to Camp Atwater and--
Speaker 2: What was--now, there's an interesting bit of history there.
Speaker 1: Um-hmm.
Speaker 2: What was camp life like in the '50s [1950s] at camp Atwater?
Speaker 1: Well of course, it was an all-black camp and for me it was very cold because I wasn't used to the cold weather and then going swimming in such cold weather.  But I enjoyed it and got a chance to meet a lot of you know other children.  I didn't--there was no one who I remembered or kept in touch with but I enjoyed it.  There were some things that I learned about life that I could have done without at that age.  But--
Speaker 2: Like--?
Speaker 1: It was a growing up experience and--but I guess that's what camp is about and I don't know that I would send my child to camp right now.  Things are so open now I guess it doesn't matter, but I enjoyed it and it was an interesting experience.  But those are the kinds of things that my mom did to give, to help me to have a balanced life.  And I know now that the village that I'm building and the theatre and all the things and the fact that I, I'm very much concerned that the children not only in Overtown [neighborhood in Miami, Florida] but the disadvantaged children all over Dade County [Miami-Dade County] have more experiences.  That's what the theatre is all about.  That's what the [Historic Overtown] Folklife Village is about.  That's what the archives is about, to give them an opportunity to know that beyond who they are and where they are right now, they can through reading, they can through field trips, now they can through television unfortunately sometimes, and on the butterfly garden that I'm hoping to build or hoping to plant will help to take them beyond where they are now so that they can become useful citizens in this community.
Speaker 2: That's great.
Speaker 1: And so that's really what I'm all about.
Story_ID: 110039
Speaker 1: So you have wonderful teachers like Marian Shannon [ph.] and your Aunt Roberta [Johnson Thompson].
Speaker 2: And Blanche Dean [ph.].
Speaker 1: And Blanche Dean.
Speaker 2: Mrs. Blanche Dean.  She was the one with the Allied Youth Against Tobacco and Alcohol.
Speaker 1: I love that.  So--
Speaker 2: And when she took us to, I'm sorry, to Buck Hill Falls, Pennsylvania and we saw J., J.C. Penney [James Cash Penney] and those, she also took us to New York and we would go to the Bowery [neighborhood in New York City, New York].  And that was the '50s [1950s] and the '60s [1960s] name for the homeless in the bowery.  But the most exciting place she would take us would be to the Cathedral of Saint John the Divine [New York City, New York].
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: And I was really very moved by that, about the story that they had--were building that over a hundred years, that generations would come and work on it and they would train their young.  And again I find myself doing that with the [Historic Overtown] Folklife Village that I'm establishing, you see.
Speaker 1: Many parallels.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.  So that's very important.
Story_ID: 110040
Speaker 1: So although you--didn't have a vision of yourself as achieving at the same level as your aunts and uncles--
Speaker 2: And mother [Dorothy Johnson Jenkins McKellar].
Speaker 1: --and your mom--
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: --but you knew you were going to college or what did you think you were doing after you finished at Booker T. [Washington High School, Miami, Florida]?
Speaker 2: Well there was never a question as to whether I was going to college.  The question was where are you, where do you want to go and have you sent the application yet?  And I really sent the application to Atlanta University [now Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, University] 'cause I didn't want to go to an all-girls school.  I didn't think that's what I wanted to do even though I knew that my aunt had been.  I had a friend then who was stationed at Fort Benning--
Speaker 1: A friend?
Speaker 2: --so I decided--
Speaker 1: And what was that friend?
Speaker 2: A boyfriend.
Speaker 1: Yeah, there we go.  I'm like--
Speaker 2: I had a boyfriend who was stationed at Fort Benning so I wanted to go be close to Fort Benning.  And it's interesting that the application went to--I sent it to Atlanta University, not understanding that they didn't have an undergraduate.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: They could have sent it to Clark [College, now Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia], they could have sent it to Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia]--to Morris Brown [College, Atlanta, Georgia], but they sent my application to Spelman [College, Atlanta, Georgia].  And I was surprised to get a response from Spelman and--
Speaker 1: After sending it to AU [Atlanta University].
Speaker 2: Of course afterwards I was very happy to be there and had a wonderful experience there.
Speaker 1: Now what dorm did you live in your freshman year?
Speaker 2: Morehouse North [now Morehouse-James Hall].
Speaker 1: Oh, just like [HM] Yvonne Jackson--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --(unclear) in Morehouse North.
Speaker 2: Oh, she was in Morehouse North?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: I became a counselor my sophomore year.  And one of my counselees was Alice Walker in Morehouse North.
Speaker 1: Really?
Speaker 2: Yes, uh-huh.  Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Wow.  Well here, just a little side note--what do you remember about Alice Walker as a student then?
Speaker 2: Being very recluse.  I mean we were in the same dorm and you know those dorms are very small.  She was always to herself and that's all I can say, she was just always to herself.  I don't remember having too many conversations with her, yes, um-hmm.
Speaker 1: And an interesting small world.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Well I lived in Abby [Aldrich] Hall, so--
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: --I always wanted to live in--well we call it Morehouse-James.
Speaker 2: Yes, now, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: But that was like the ultimate cool dorm.
Speaker 2: Oh really?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Well until they built the really new ones.
Speaker 2: Yes, well Willis [Laurence] James was one of--was at the Florida Baptist Academy [Jacksonville, Florida] when Uncle Sammy was there.
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: Dr. S.H. Johnson, the radiologist.  So when I got to Spelman, Uncle Sammy said well be sure and look up my classmate Willis James.  So I went at a time when they were rehearsing and preparing for the Glee Club, auditioning for the Glee Club.  So I went in to audition and after we got through with the audition I went up to him and I said, my uncle--you and my uncle went to Florida Baptist Academy at the same time.  Of course he looked up.
Speaker 1: Hadn't heard that.
Speaker 2: He said, you're Sam's niece?  I said yes.  He said stand over there.  You don't sing.  You can't sing.  I'll find something else for you to do (laughter).  Stand over here.  You can't sing.  I'll assign something else to you.  So finally I was the one who would--well you don't know about this, but when you went to Chapel, in order to know the hymns that were to be sung, the numbers were put over the door.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: So I got to be the one to put the numbers over the door.
Speaker 1: He just boldly told you, you couldn't sing?
Speaker 2: Yes, he said no, you can't sing.  But Catherine [Fields' daughter], when Catherine was there 19--she graduated in 1991.
Speaker 1: (Unclear)?
Speaker 2: She came in with Johnnetta Cole, she was in that class with her.
Speaker 1: Right, right.  That's--
Speaker 2: Yes, the first class.
Speaker 1: Yeah, 'cause Johnnetta came my sophomore year.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So, it was '87 [1987].
Speaker 2: So Catherine did qualify for the Glee Club and she sang one year, yes.
Speaker 1: You were vindicated.
Speaker 2: Yes, absolutely.
Speaker 1: So, now what was life--now you started at Spelman in what year?
Speaker 2: Nineteen-sixty [1960].
Speaker 1: Nineteen-sixty.
Speaker 2: Very interesting story.
Speaker 1: Yes, please share.
Speaker 2: Very interesting story.
Story_ID: 110041
Speaker 1: But in high school, let me just finish with that, there was an intergroup youth council for high school students.  Booker T. Washington High School [Miami, Florida] was a part of it, Jackson, I guess--Miami Senior High, not Jackson but Miami Senior High School, which was an all-white school.  And Mrs. Marie Roberts [ph.] who was the human relations teacher at Booker T. Washington along with Mamie Williams [ph.], they were counselors.  But it was Marie Roberts who was really a part of getting black children and white children to at least know each other.  The South of course was still segregated by law at that time and it was--
Speaker 2: But it's, even though post-Brown [Brown v. Board of Education (1954)], what was Miami [Florida] like?
Speaker 1: Well no, this is 1959, 1960.  This was--
Speaker 2: So that's what I'm saying, it's post--
Speaker 1: --pre-Brown.  Pre-Brown.
Speaker 2: No, 1954 was the Brown Decision.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay, all right.  I'm thinking of civil rights in '64 [1964].  Right, right post-Brown, '60 [1960] '50 [1950]--well, that didn't--
Speaker 2: Didn't change it?
Speaker 1: Brown who?  Brown who?
Speaker 2: Never heard of him.
Speaker 1: It was still against the law for black people and white people to be in the same room.  We would be arrested if he were in this room with us today.
Speaker 2: Against the law to be in the same room here in Florida?
Speaker 1: In the same room with us, yes.  And the other--
Speaker 2: Wow.
Speaker 1: --southern states.  So Brown--to the point that the Intergroup Youth Council, which it was started earlier before my time in the '30s [1930s], and by the time I got in it in the '50s [1950s] the--there were people from the University of Miami [Miami, Florida] who would have meetings once a month and we'd all meet at the YWCA [Young Women's Christian Association] downtown.  But the police would have to be notified that we were going to be meeting.  And sometimes if for any reason, god forbid white children and black children were riding in the same car, the police would stop you.  Oh no, this was very real.  This was very real.  So in my lifetime I never expected it to change.

Speaker 1: When I got on the train to go to, with all my other cohorts going to Clark [College, now Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia] and Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia] and Morris Brown [College, Atlanta, Georgia], oh we had a good time.  At the time, I was the only one going to Spelman, but there was someone going to ITC [Interdenominational Theological Center, Atlanta, Georgia], oh it was wonderful.  And we went by train.  We never expected things to change because we were going from a segregated community to another segregated community.  Freshman year of course the first week or two, you take exams and I took the reading exam just as you did.  I did not score high on the reading exam and so I was sent to a reading class.  I had to take reading my freshman year and then later on had to catch up.  So I was assigned to a reading teacher whose name was [HM] Christine King Farris and she said to us about two or three weeks in that my brother [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] and his wife [Coretta Scott King] and family are going to be coming to Atlanta and he--my brother is going to need some help.  He's going to be at Rush Memorial Church which is you know, not too far from Spelman and right down Fair Street and I will give you permission to get out of the gate and go down to Rush Memorial Church to help my brother, if you will do my homework first.  Now you have to understand what it meant to get out of the gate, front gate at Spelman or any gate at Spelman in 1960.
Speaker 2: Yes, that was the other part that I wanted to get to because it went through phases.  So how was it in 1960?
Speaker 1: You had to have a recent handwritten letter from your mother [Dorothy Johnson Jenkins McKellar] and they already had her handwriting because I had some sisters who played some--who tried to do that for themselves, who tried to write their mother's letters for them.  So early on they--the administration had your mother's handwriting or your guardian, whoever it was.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Yes, so it had to be a recent letter from mother on file.  You had to have at least, I think five friends to walk with you.  You had to have on stockings.  You had to have on hose.  You had to have on a hat and a purse and gloves to get out of the gate.
Speaker 2: So, you know you couldn't wear pants and sandals?
Speaker 1: Pants?
Speaker 2: (Unclear)?
Speaker 1: Oh no.  Well, in 1960 you didn't wear pants to work.  Women did not wear pants in the street.  I remember finishing in '64 [1964], and coming home and there being a big faculty meeting about whether you could wear pants to work.  I mean I was as the folks would say fully grown before that happened.  So at any rate, she told us about her brother and of course the first Saturday everybody was there.  The whole class was there and then it started tapering off.  And so I remember when Martin Luther King--cause I was with him every Saturday, that he was in Mi--in Atlanta, in '60 [1960] and '61 [1961], several of us continued to go and help.  And I remember him always for the most part in his overcoat and his hat.  And even with his hat on, he wasn't too much taller than I am.  And he would tell us what he wanted and we would write press releases and of course we were all very nervous because if it wasn't correct of course, it'd get back to her.  And she's a very stern woman.  I saw her at Catherine's [Fields' daughter] graduation and said hello, 'cause she wouldn't remember me.  I was just one of many.
Speaker 2: Right.
Story_ID: 110043
Speaker 1: But that was quite an experience then because as the movement [Civil Rights Movement] started, I mean when we started with him [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] in the fall of '60 [1960], it was a matter of helping to get Rich's Department Store to serve black people.  One of the graduation presents that I got was a credit card to Rich's Department Store, one of the largest department stores in the southeast.  And of course I would--wanted it so I could go for dinner and treat my friends for food.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: I wasn't--and a few clothes, but then food. Not that the food at Spelman [College, Atlanta, Georgia] wasn't good but it was just a matter of being out and being able to do something someplace else.  But we couldn't sit down.  You'd have to get it and stand up.  And so it started off a very small movement and then I remember I guess maybe--that was in the fall, maybe by spring he told us that they're going to start marching, actually walking from the AU Center [Atlanta University Center, Atlanta, Georgia] to downtown, to Rich's, and so we started doing that.  And we made a human chain around Rich's, and you know how large Rich's is?
Speaker 2: Yeah, the one right Downtown--
Speaker 1: Downtown.
Speaker 2: --it's huge.
Speaker 1: That was the only one at the time.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: Yeah, there's no Lenox Mall and--
Speaker 1: Didn't exist.  A human chain was made.
Speaker 2: Of Spelman [College, Atlanta, Georgia] and Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia] and Clark [College, Atlanta, Georgia] students?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: And Morris Brown [College, Atlanta, Georgia]?
Speaker 1: And students started coming from all over the country.  And when we would get to--we would march quietly.  You were not supposed to say anything--just and if anyone said anything to you, just you know turn the other cheek, don't say anything.  When we would get to a corner, the Ku Klux--Klu Klux Klan in full regalia would come and run into us.
Speaker 2: Oh!
Speaker 1: And the guys from Morehouse would be--the Ku Klux Klan would do a counter march.  The guys from Morehouse would run across the street through the traffic and try to catch us, hold their arms out like this so we wouldn't be pushed into the traffic.
Speaker 2: Wow.
Speaker 1: The Ku Klux Klan would also march with, do a counter march.  We're going one way, there going another.  They had bowling balls in shopping bags and they would swing the bowling--the shopping bag to try to hit us in the stomach, to try to give us you know, so we wouldn't be able to have children.  It was not easy.  And then we would--
Speaker 2: Bowling balls?
Speaker 1: Bowling balls in shopping bags that they would swing at us, try to hit you.
Speaker 2: Right, cause you're not going to punch a woman?
Speaker 1: Yes, yes, yes, yes, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.
Speaker 2: Wow.
Speaker 1: And then when we get back on campus there would be a cross-burning.
Speaker 2: So--
Speaker 1: So I don't know how we studied.  I don't know how we studied and how we got through.  And I know my mother [Dorothy Johnson Jenkins McKellar] was so, so afraid because she said, not only for my safety and the safety of my friends and the whole campus, but she was concerned that she was going to lose her job.  She said if they see you on television, and recognize you I can lose my job.
Speaker 2: Wow.
Speaker 1: So she was always very afraid, yes, that she would lose her job.  And she could have.
Speaker 2: To think, so that retaliation--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --all the way down here--
Speaker 1: Oh, definitely.
Speaker 2: --because of--?
Speaker 1: Oh, sure, sure.
Speaker 2: Had that happened to anybody else that you knew around here or just--?
Speaker 1: No, but did [HM] Thelma Gibson tell you that her husband [Reverend Canon Theodore Roosevelt Gibson] was with, was president of the [Miami chapter of the] NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] and they--the [Joseph] McCarthy people requested during the Red Scare, the membership roll and her husband refused to do it and they, yes.
Speaker 2: No, she didn't.
Speaker 1: She didn't tell you that story?  Oh my, that was very important, yes, uh-huh.  So we knew that that could happen.  We knew that that could happen.
Story_ID: 110044
Speaker 1: What was Dr. [Albert] Manley's response to this student activism because, I mean, the Spelman [College, Atlanta, Georgia] lady, some woman with her gloves and hat and her hose is not supposed to be battling bowling balls in shopping bags?
Speaker 2: Yeah. He was a fine gentleman and I thought very timid.  He was like a father.  He was a father figure and he was very concerned about it.  I remember Herschelle Sullivan [Challenor], I saw her in Boston [Massachusetts] with--some time ago.  She was I think with the United Nations.  She was a senior at the time and Marian Edelman, [HM] Marian Wright Edelman--Edelson.
Speaker 1: Man [Edelman].
Speaker 2: Edelman, yes, was in that senior class.  And so they were all activists and it really didn't matter what he said.  The movement was--it was like a groundswell.  The fall of '60 [1960], it started off very calmly, young ladies now you're at Spelman.  And his big thing that I remember is that he continued to tell us that behind us was a generation of children that Spelman had to prepare for.  Now we--they're known as baby boomers, but they were immediately behind us and his big concern at that time in addition to the Civil Rights Movement, was that--was Spelman going to be prepared with dormitories and curriculum and programs for the children who had been conceived at the end of World War II [WWII].
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And that they were coming and he just wanted to be sure that it--that the campus and the school was ready and would be a part of that change.  And so change was so much a part of my days, of both the Civil Rights Movement and the now known as, generation known as baby boomers.
Story_ID: 110045
Speaker 1: At-- at that time in addition to the Civil Rights Movement, how were young Spelman [College, Atlanta, Georgia] students dealing with--and I know it's a little early, but in having freedom?  It didn't just--it wasn't just racial but also gender freedom.  So were those some of the issues that were addressed at that time, like you know, I don't want to have to wear clothes and carry a purse.  You know, why can't I just leave campus?
Speaker 2: Then you don't go to Spelman at that time.
Speaker 1: So the only--there was no--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --movement in that respect at that time?
Speaker 2: Well, there was unrest.  If you were a freshman and went to the movies you had to be in by nine o'clock, sophomore, ten, junior, eleven and senior, twelve.
Speaker 1: Could you live off campus?
Speaker 2: Not if you were from out-of-town.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: If you were from out of town then it was assumed that you would live on campus unless there was some extraordinary reason why you couldn't.  But if in fact you came in after nine o'clock and you were a freshman, the--your ticket home was available the next day.  I mean there was just no question.  You stayed out all--if you stayed out all night.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Now if you came home an hour late--
Speaker 1: That's one thing.
Speaker 2: --then they would, you would be reprimanded.  But if you stayed out all night, then your ticket home was waiting for you.  They'd buy it for you.  And your--yes, it was just no question about it.
Speaker 1: So what was your major?
Speaker 2: Art.
Speaker 1: Really?
Speaker 2: I was an art major, yes.  My mother [Dorothy Johnson Jenkins McKellar] kept saying to me, get some education.  But I don't want to be a teacher.  I don't want to be a teacher because I don't want my dining room table filled with schoolwork like my mother and my aunts.  I don't want to be a teacher because I don't want to have to use my money to buy supplies for the school.  I don't want to be a teacher 'cause I don't want to be a teacher.  I've got to be something else.  And so I didn't want to major in psychology.  I talked to someone the other day and they said--I asked what are you majoring in?  Psychology.  I said are they still doing that?
Speaker 1: Uh--huh.
Speaker 2: After all these years?  And usually that's an area that you go into because you're not sure what you're going to do.  And so I decided that I would be an art major, art history major.  And Mrs. Holloway, of course, I'm sure she wasn't there when you were there.
Speaker 1: I don't think so.
Speaker 2: I would hope not (laughter).
Speaker 1: Geez, how old was she then, like one hundred?
Speaker 2: The time comes when you just need to rest, to rest your body, your mind and your soul.  Someone they told me is still there that shouldn't be there, but anyway.
Speaker 1: There was a lot of somebodies--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --like that.
Speaker 2: I'm sure, but you get into it and it becomes a part of you.  But my mom kept writing me and calling me and saying are you majoring in education?  And the answer was all, always no.  But finally with her persistence, she said but that's the way you're going to be able to get a job.  And no matter what else you do, you can at least start off with that.  In other words you're not going to come home and do nothing.  You need a job.  You're going to--
Speaker 1: And it was assumed--
Speaker 2: --have to work.
Speaker 1: --that you were going come back to Florida after school?
Speaker 2: It was assumed.  Now my senior year I sort of caught up and did well, except for French and the 'D' was for Dorothy is what I said.  That was the only 'D' I got but I just--that was not quite my interest.
Story_ID: 110046
Speaker 1: But I did get an offer for a scholarship at Pratt Institute [New York City, New York].
Speaker 2: Oh--
Speaker 1: And that's interesting because--
Speaker 2: --in Brooklyn [New York City, New York].
Speaker 1: --that's where Catherine [Fields' daughter] lives.  There is a campus, part of the campus is right there on Myrtle Avenue.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: And Catherine lives across the street from it in her condo.
Speaker 2: That's so funny.
Speaker 1: Sure, sure, sure.  And the gentleman came and I was interviewed and he was telling me that his wife would help me find an apartment.  And I remembered when, as a child when we would go to visit Aunt Alice in New York, that Aunt Alice lived I guess on the twelfth floor and there was no elevator and the only way you could get to the twelfth floor was the stairs.  And there was one light up there and I'm thinking do I want to live in a place like that?  And I--you know where I live now, it's a house and I have all of this room and I have grass and everything.  Do I really want to do that?  And I know also when we would go to visit our cousins would eat in shifts so they wouldn't have to offer us any food.
Speaker 2: Wait, wait.  I--
Speaker 1: So I thought that's what everybody in New York did.
Speaker 2: Eat in shifts.
Speaker 1: In shifts.  We knew they were eating.  We would go and visit and it would get to be dinnertime and they'd never offer us anything but they'd come back wiping their mouths and you know, they ate in shifts.  I said, well I don't want to do that.  But we did have cousins in St. Albans, New York, Mamie and T. R. Manuel [ph.], and they had a beautiful home with their daughter Susan.  And so whenever we went out to St. Albans, that was a different story.  But to live right there in New York--
Speaker 2: Ate in shifts.
Speaker 1: They ate in shifts.
Speaker 2: That is terrible.
Speaker 1: And never offered us anything, so I knew then that I did not want to live in a situation like that.  So I gave up the--and cold weather.
Story_ID: 110047
Speaker 1: I mean my senior year [at Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia], I took the teachers' exam early.  Uncle Sammy suggested I take it in the summer since I wasn't doing anything and that if I you know didn't pass or didn't make a high enough score, then I could take it again.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: At least I was familiar with it which made a lot of sense.  Again, they always gave me advice and many times I didn't take it, but I listened to it.  And I, for the most part, I took it which is what some of our young people don't do--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --sometimes.  So, I went to--I was able to go to Smith College [Northampton, Massachusetts] because they had the second semester my senior year--no, Spelman always has exchange programs for students. I read about this exchange program and decided that I wanted to try that since it was so close to Boston [Massachusetts] and I could get a chance to see my uncle and aunt.  And my uncle of course decided that he was going to drive from Boston to Northampton [Massachusetts] in one of Boston's worst blizzards he would drive a block, have to get out and scrape the snow off the windshield, and my aunt was just beside herself.  Benjamin, park this car.  We'll never get there.  They fussed the whole way.  And how he knew which way to go with all the snow, I don't know.  But the day we got there it was a beautiful, beautiful sunny day, cold but sunny day at Northampton.  And that was really the first time that I had seen snow.  Of course in Atlanta [Georgia] it pretends to snow and everybody gets excited about it, but it really doesn't.
Speaker 2: That was the real deal.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: So you're finishing at Spelman.
Speaker 1: Well, but at--you need to hear this because at--when I got to Smith, the roommate that I was supposed to have moved out.  As it turned out her father--she was white and her father was from New Jersey and he was running for office that fall.  And it was decided from his agent in his campaign that he should, she should not room with me and so she moved out.  So that was--so I had a room by myself.  The second incident at Smith, I was straightening my hair, smell and sounds, and I heard a fire truck.  Now the girls next door were ironing their hair--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: -- with wax paper.  Then you had long straight hair.  In order to get long straight hair the white girls would use wax paper and put their long hair on the ironing board and use a hot--a warm iron--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and iron their hair.  So they were ironing their hair and I had a straightening comb, I was straightening mine.  And I heard the fire truck coming and clanging and coming up the stairs and then they came into my room.  And I didn't know what the problem was.  I'm just sitting there minding my own business.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And they said, where's the fire?  I said, well there's no fire in here.  The fire was in my hand.  It was my straightening comb that they had smelled.
Speaker 2: What, someone called?
Speaker 1: Yes, uh-huh.
Speaker 2: Oh okay.
Speaker 1: They, cause they could smell the hair burning and they thought I guess I was in there you know, I don't know.
Speaker 2: Immolating yourself?
Speaker 1: Yes, something like that.  And then they asked me, one of those forums, one of those round table discussions and they would say well, how do you like Smith?  And I was enjoying it because as an art major they had slides, art slides of art through the centuries.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And we didn't have that at Spelman, so that was quite interesting.  We would--I guess I was there about six weeks.  There were, I guess, about three, three or four of us.
Story_ID: 109349
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Okay, so you're at this forum at Smith [College, Northampton, Massachusetts], what--they would just hold for students to air concerns and--?
Speaker 1: Yes.  And again, they brought us there to see if black women from southern colleges could in fact adapt to the seven sister schools [the Seven Sisters].  I think it was really a project of the seven sister schools.  And I was at--we were at Smith, some of the other girls were at you know, other places.
Speaker 2: Like Holyoke [Mount Holyoke College, South Hadley, Massachusetts]?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Sarah Lawrence [College, Bronxville, New York]?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Vassar [College, Poughkeepsie, New York].
Speaker 1: So the question came up in this forum, how do you know when you're clean?  If you're black, how do you know when you're clean?  And it wasn't so foreign because I had seen on television some of--when they--some of their washing products, whom I shall not name, but I can see very vividly--
Speaker 2: Why won't you name them?
Speaker 1: --they would have a--
Speaker 2: There's nothing wrong.
Speaker 1: --dark towel like Tide--I, I--they've had Tide commercials where they would hold up a brown towel to smell it to see if it was clean.  So it wasn't so new to me, but it was still offensive that someone would actually need to--not--would need to know that.  I mean were to ask that, to ask it--I don't know.
Speaker 2: Do you remember what you said in response?
Speaker 1: No, I don't.
Speaker 2: Well long as you weren't dragged out kicking and screaming I guess then--
Speaker 1: Yes, yes, yes.
Speaker 2: So that was just you're second semester, senior year--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --that you were at Smith?
Speaker 1: Yes, and again, not the entire semester.  It was I guess about six or nine weeks that we were there.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yes, yes.
Speaker 2: So--
Story_ID: 109350
Speaker 1: So I came home because staying in Atlanta [Georgia], while I thought about it many times as we all do, I guess--I realized that I didn't know anyone there.  I'd been there for four years, I had met some people but I had not connected.  I didn't have any educational experience.  Then, blacks seemed to have three or four PhDs.  I didn't have one, I didn't have a master's.  And my family was not a part of the pioneer structure and that was important to me.  I need to be connected to feel connected.  So I thought well, I know where I can go.  I can go home.  And again, I know that they'll help me find something and because--while I was at Spelman [College, Atlanta, Georgia], I started working in the library with Mrs. Mickleberry [ph.] and--who was the other person from Albany, Georgia?  I'll think of her name in a minute.  She was really the connection because my Aunt Johnna Lee was from Albany.  She married my uncle John.  And Hulda Wilson was the assistant librarian.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So my Aunt Johnna Lee told me that Hulda Wilson was someone who would help me find a job.  Not that I needed one but I wanted to fill the time a little bit.  And since everybody else was working, I was the only one I think who wasn't on scholarship.
Speaker 2: Now you mean fill the time between when you came back from Smith [College, Northampton, Massachusetts] and graduation or--
Speaker 1: I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: --after graduation?
Speaker 1: Fill the time while I was at Spelman.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I'm back at Spelman now, to fill, fill that time.  And I want to go back and talk a little bit about my time at Spelman because that led me to the work that I'm doing now.  And so I guess my sophomore year, I may have applied for a job and worked in the library and really liked it.  And a lot of time they were just sitting and reading.  I thought, oh I can do that.  Did not know about all the other things that you need to do as a librarian.  If I had understood it, I would have started taking my master's at Atlanta University [now Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia] at the same time and could have gotten a master's when I got my bachelors.  But I didn't realize that there was a library program at Atlanta University until I was almost through.  But became very much interested in library science and children's libraries, and the fact that children--every circumstance that you have, there is a book that's been written.  Somebody's already done it.  And so you can refer children to children's books and see how other people have solved their problems.  And that became very interesting to me.  So I finished Spelman, came back to Miami [Florida] with all intentions of going back to Atlanta University.  I did get a scholarship--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --to AU and so I just came home for the summer to rest and to prepare myself for AU.  So while I was here, my mom [Dorothy Johnson Jenkins McKellar] had one of her friends who was a principal to interview me.  She needed a librarian.  Well, I only had six hours in library science from Atlanta University.  This was an elementary school way down south and the principal Mrs. Azzalena Pinckney [ph.] agreed to interview me and of course I went then with my hat and gloves and hose and heels, yes--Spelman.  Oh, Mrs. Pinckney, I don't think she even interviewed me.  She was just so delighted to have a Spelman woman interested in her school, in her library.  And it was a very small school, I guess maybe about three or four hundred children, way south in the agricultural part of Miami.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So I got the job immediately, start the next day.
Speaker 2: Wow.
Speaker 1: Yes.  So before I accepted it of course, I called Spelman and talked with Hulda Wilson to find out if she agreed to it.  If she thought it was something I should do.  So she said, how much are they going to pay you?  I said, 13,000 dollars.  She said, well I--let me tell you.  I have I think, she said two master's degrees and she'd been working at Spelman there for thirteen years and I think she was only making ten-five, 10,500 dollars.
Speaker 2: Are you kidding?
Speaker 1: She said stay.  And I didn't have to pay rent.
Speaker 2: Okay, wow.
Speaker 1: And I was getting--
Speaker 2: And she was only making-?
Speaker 1: Ten thousand five hundred dollars and I was starting off at 13,000.  She said stay.  So--
Speaker 2: (Unclear) and see if you can switch jobs.
Speaker 1: Yes, yes, yes, yes.  So I stayed and of course with the understanding that I would go ahead and get my certification in library science.  So that's when I started as a school librarian and reading teacher.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 109351
Speaker 1: Two years into that--so that was '64 [1964].  So by '65 [1965], '66 [1966], there was a program for a cadre of eleven persons were selected to be in a federal program.  And we were trained how to replace eleven teachers in senior high schools every six weeks so that the teachers that we replaced would go to Robert E. Lee Middle School and be trained how to deal with Negroes.
Speaker 2: Robert E. Lee--
Speaker 1: --E. Lee.
Speaker 2: --School, to learn how to deal with Negroes?
Speaker 1: Negroes, yes.
Speaker 2: You weren't colored anymore then?
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: Okay, let me just--
Speaker 1: Interesting.
Speaker 2: --see if I understand this.
Speaker 1: And a federal program that was--oh, it was a big program.  So that's what we did.  We would go into, we--I think I went into about five different schools with a team, with a cadre and replaced the people who were there and they went and got colorized.
Speaker 2: Oh my goodness.  Okay, let's put you in a larger perspective what's going on in America at the time.  So John F. Kennedy has been assassinated in '63 [1963], right before you finish at Spelman [College, Atlanta, Georgia].
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Lyndon Johnson is now president, Great Society programs.  Was this one of those Great Society programs?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Or was it a State--?
Speaker 1: No, no it was a federal program.
Speaker 2: Federal programs, right.
Speaker 1: Yeah, definitely a federal program.
Speaker 2: But what is Miami [Florida] like now in 1964?
Speaker 1: Same Miami.
Speaker 2: Still--?
Speaker 1: Still segregated, oh yes, in mind and thought as well as in deed.  Oh yes, uh-huh.  So that going to Homestead Senior High School [Homestead, Florida] for instance, which is way south and all, was then all white, it was not a good feeling at all.  I mean the faculty shunned us.  The parents didn't know why we were there.  It was an uproar and the whole, but the whole idea was to prepare the schools for the fall because they were going to be sending black children to that school.
Speaker 2: So now, there was ten years after Brown [v. Board of Education (1954)], the schools in Miami are finally going to desegregate?
Speaker 1: Think about desegregating because again this was a federal program.  So the federal government was saying this is what you are going to have to do in order to receive federal funds, yes.  And so that continued and I then transferred to, finally to Myrtle Grove Elementary School [Miami Gardens, Florida?].  And about that time--which is north of here.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: An all-white school again.  And about that time, August of 1966 was married.
Speaker 2: Okay, and your husband's name?
Speaker 1: My then-husband, Eddie Fields, who was finishing the serve--in the service and--
Speaker 2: Wait, is this your same boyfriend who was at Fort Benning?
Speaker 1: Oh ab--no.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: No, that didn't work out and so we went our separate ways.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But I did marry in August of '66 [1966], and Eddie had actually been in the service and came back to Miami to live.  He was originally from South Carolina which later on fits into the story.  It's interesting how things connect and you have to wonder about predestination because sometimes it comes together so well, you--I have to wonder.  We married and he then went to school, because he had not been to college before but always wanted to.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So he went to--there wasn't a community college here at the time so he--well yes, he started Miami Dade Community College [Miami, Florida] and then went to Florida Atlantic University to finish in Boca Raton [Florida].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: FIU [Florida International University, Miami, Florida] had not come on board then.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But we now have a state university right here in Miami.
Speaker 2: Which is funny if you think about, you know, one of its most populous cities not having--
Speaker 1: Yes, a state university, yes, but we do now.  And I have an honorary doctorate from there.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: Yes, mm-hmm.
Story_ID: 109352
Speaker 1: So it was ten years later in 1974, getting ready for the [U.S.] Bicentennial and there were all this--these posters and all the media hype about preparing for the Bicentennial and everybody should be involved in it.  I thought well, I'm at an all-white school.  I need to do something.  And let me just tell you about my first time going to the school.
Speaker 2: This is at Myrtle?
Speaker 1: At Myrtle Grove--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --Elementary School [Miami Gardens, Florida?], yes.  At first I didn't know where to go.  It was up 27th Avenue but black people lived on the east side of 27th Avenue, so I had never been.  Never been on the west side of 27th Avenue and I was lost getting there and finally I called the school and they told me where to go and I was afraid because as a child and young adult that was off limits.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So I did go and about two or three days after I had been there, I was walking around with my Louis Vuitton, which Catherine [Fields' daughter] now owns, and one of the teachers stopped me and she said, you haven't cleaned my room.
Speaker 2: You--
Speaker 1: So I didn't say anything to her.  I--
Speaker 2: 'Cause you of course, are--
Speaker 1: I'm dressed.
Speaker 2: --a Spelman [College, Atlanta, Georgia] woman and--
Speaker 1: Yes, of course, with my Louis Vuitton bag, which was really all the rage then.  I see them--see it creeping back now but that was "the" thing then.  So I didn't say anything to her and by the end of the week, she came to me again and said, I'm going to have to report you. She thought I was the, she thought I was a new maid at the school, and I knew what she thought.  So--
Speaker 2: Did you report her?
Speaker 1: No, because I knew that I would be introduced at faculty meeting on Tuesday.
Speaker 2: So Tuesday rolls around--
Speaker 1: You choose your--I learned early to choose my battles.  So when Tuesday came and at the end of the faculty meeting I--oh yes, and we have a new faculty member.  Dorothy Jenkins is now the librarian and I stood up and said to her--(No audible response, waves hand with a big smile).  And of course she came over and apologized profusely and--but we became very good friends--
Speaker 2: How funny.
Speaker 1: --after that.  And then my clerk was an older woman, Mrs. Florence Gerard [ph.], I will never forget her.  And it was unsettling to her to have to work with and for a black person.  She had never thought that in her life.  A southern white woman who was working because she had to work now, and whatever her husband had wasn't enough.  But she wasn't even accustomed to working and found herself in this situation.  I had a regular-sized desk and she had a table as a desk that faced mine.  Whenever the books--we ordered books--whenever the books came she was uncomfortable if I was there because if the person delivering the books was a white man, she wanted, she didn't want him to think--
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: --that--and I was the--in charge and she was working for me.  And it was so unsettling to her and once we finally talked about it 'cause at first, I didn't know what the problem was.  And first, when I realized what the problem was, I said I tell you what we'll do Mrs. Gerard, always Mrs. Gerard.  I will, when they come to deliver the books, I'll get up and go into the library and you can sit here and check the books in.  Just don't sign my name.  You sign your name as having received them and that will be fine.  Will that help you?  She said, well yes.  She did not come back the next year.  She was that unsettled.
Story_ID: 109353
Speaker 1: Well I was there [Myrtle Grove Elementary School, Miami Gardens, Florida] in '66 [1966], and by '74 [1974], when they were talking about the [U.S.] Bicentennial, I thought it would be good for our children, for the children there to know about the black people in Miami [Florida]. I had no idea how long my family had been there.  I just knew all of the stories--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --that my uncles would tell and my aunts and whatever and my mother.  And so I called the downtown library because as an educator, you could get as many as twenty-five books on any subject to take to your school and I'd done that all the time for other teachers or if I was working on a project.  So I expected to get at least ten or fifteen books on local blacks.  Called the downtown library and asked, told them what I wanted and so they connected me to the Florida room.  They--and so I said I was looking for books about black people in Miami and the state of Florida.  She put me on hold and then came back after what seemed like a long period of time, so she said we only have a folder with obituaries about black people in Miami.
Speaker 2: Not one book?  Not one?
Speaker 1: We only have a folder with obituaries.  And I said why?  She said, I guess those people haven't thought enough of themselves to write their history and I was just stunned and disappointed and upset.  First of all she didn't realize from my voice that I was one of those people, but maybe one of the reasons she didn't was because I spent summers you see, in Northampton [Massachusetts].  I mean--
Speaker 2: And Springfield.
Speaker 1: --in the Berkshires [Massachusetts], yes and in Springfield and all those places.  And of course everyone in my mother's family spoke perfect English.  So that's all--and my mother [Dorothy Johnson Jenkins McKellar] was an English and physical education major, so that's all I heard.  And I remember mother, my mother always saying it's not white, it's white.  It's not library [pronouncing it li-berry], its library.  There were certain things that I was taught to say, a way to speak so that I would always be accepted by the larger community is what I was told.  So I did not want to accept what the person at the library said.  So I said well somebody must be, must have done something?  And she said, well the Historical Museum [of Southern Florida, now HistoryMiami, Miami, Florida] has been in business since the '40s [1940s].  Call them and see if they will have something.  And I said Historical Museum?  I had never heard of them.  And she gave me the number and Dr. Thelma Peters answered.  And when she answered, she said that she was a board member for the Historical Museum, that she had been a teacher for thirty years at Edison Senior High School [Miami, Florida], an all-white high school, and that she had just retired, had gone to the University of Florida [Gainesville, Florida] and gotten her Ph.D., earned her Ph.D. in history.  And so now that she was back and that she had interviewed some people and asked about black people for her book on Lemon City [Little Haiti, a neighborhood in Miami, Florida] and they had given her some pictures and they had given her some interviews, but they didn't seem interested beyond that.  And that she also had a friend, Arva Moore Parks [McCabe] who was also at the Historical Museum as a volunteer and as an active historian and that Arva was working on a book on Coconut Grove [neighborhood in Miami, Florida].  And she too had talked with people but had not gotten anything beyond some pictures and a few interviews.  And she was in my mind, saying the same thing that the person at the library was saying, that people really didn't care.  Of course that wasn't true because you know black people were not even allowed by law for over a hundred years to learn to read and write.  I mean there are just so many things that might discourage someone.  But be that as it may, she was very interested because my family was from the Bahamas and that I had talked about that and that Arva's then-husband was from the same place that my grandparents grew up, Harbour Island, not just the Bahamas.
Speaker 2: Right, but--
Speaker 1: But Harbour Island.
Story_ID: 109354
Speaker 1: And later on, I found out that the Parks family signed--that the Parks family was a part of the government and they signed many of the documents for my family and other families.  Her [Arva Moore Parks McCabe] husband's uncle or grand-uncle was in fact the recorder, yes, like the--for the circuit court, something like someone for the court.  So that was a very interesting--so they were able, they were very interested in me and what I brought to the table.  And I was able to get myself reassigned from the school [Myrtle Grove Elementary School, Miami Gardens, Florida] to the downtown social studies office through the American Association of University Women [AAUW].  They were the ones who said, who were threatening to write a book about women.  And it was a threat because there'd never been a book about white women, black women, no women at all in Miami [Florida].  And I'll--that's one of the things that I need to show you, a copy of the, it's called 'Julia's Daughters[: Women in Dade's History' by Marie Anderson]
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And Julia was a white woman from Cleveland, Ohio whose vision it was that Miami would become a tourist mecca.  And she was the one who really encouraged [Henry] Flagler to extend the railroad [Florida East Coast Railway] from Palm Beach [Florida] to Miami [Miami, Florida].  So I wanted to learn how to do that and so I worked with them on writing 'Julia's Daughters.'  And the school system said, well will give you a half a day to do research on women and a half a day to do research on children, on blacks and the rest of the time you must prepare and present curriculum.  And in doing that they didn't have any place for me to sit so they actually assigned me to the Historical Museum [of Southern Florida, now HistoryMiami, Miami, Florida] and I'd never ever thought about a historical museum before.  And I was fascinated so much so that whenever I didn't have a tour to give, I was in the office listening and watching to see what they were doing.  If the secretary was out ill, I would go and be the secretary for that--I'd volunteer to be the secretary that day and take the phone calls.  Whenever I'd hear them talking about writing a grant, I'd ask to sit in.  So I learned how to write a grant, from getting the information, collecting the information, writing the grant, getting the letters of support, putting it to--the package together, everything--putting the stamp on it and taking it to the mailbox and mailing it.  I learned everything.
Speaker 2: All of those steps?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: So, these events that--like you said the [U.S.] Bicentennial, your own personal interest in your family history, and the lack of information kind of moved you to square one?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Story_ID: 109355
Speaker 1: What continues to propel you along this path that's brought you here?
Speaker 2: Well, actually when I went home the day after, the day that I spoke with the women at the library, and she had said--so what she said, I went home and Uncle Sammy lived right across the street and I went, stopped home like my uncles and aunts would always do--
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: --and talked to him about it.  So he said, "Well Mrs. Fields, I guess you don't understand our history any more than the woman at the library."  He's saying don't blame her.  This is the kind of family, right?  No nonsense.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Okay, remember my mom [Dorothy Johnson Jenkins McKellar] and the F, okay.  Never, you know not any nonsense, loving family, but no nonsense.  He said, "Well you don't understand it any better than she.  The fact is my generation has been too busy trying to survive.  It's going to be up to you and your generation to write the history.  No there's no written history.  It's going to be up to your generation."  He was very philosophical about it and always with stories to tell.  He even told me that as a young boy, he remembers in Miami's Colored Town [now Overtown, Miami, Florida] the old men sitting around talking and playing checkers and laughing and boasting that they helped Miami become a city.  So once I started on this, it opened new vistas, which was his, one of his favorite words.  He said, "See if you can find any evidence of what they've been talking about."  And sure enough I was able to get from the clerk's office a copy of the original charter for the city of Miami, and it just blew my mind because that charter shows--we have that original copy.  I mean we have a copy of that--the same copy that I got then, I have now and I want to bring it out for you to see it, shows that a third of the men who stood for the City of Miami's incorporation were black men.  And my uncle really wanted see if the men could--who could read or write.  He wanted to know which names he recognized, and many of them had been in slavery.
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: See, this was 1896--
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: --and so that was 19-, I mean 1865, so many of them were old men but they were there.  As it turns out all of the names were written in one hand, the hand of the clerk of the court at the time.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But next to each man's name was his race, so that's how we knew.
Speaker 1: Oh, exactly.
Speaker 2: That's how we know who was black and who was white.  That's why instead of people saying, "Oh, you should have a museum." I say, well a museum is fine and you bring in collections and you interpret the collections.  But when you identify, collect, process and make available to students and scholars and teachers and to the public at large, the primary source material that then is interpreted by a historian, then for me that, that goes deeper than just showing something that's on the wall, and so I started collecting primary sources.
Story_ID: 109356
Speaker 1: Well you know what, I wanted--probably just group it as, well not a group but ask you when did you pursue your master's degree?  What year-- was that later on?
Speaker 2: Well, that was in the early '70s [1970s].  I was really searching for something.  This--that was before I started the archives.  In fact, I had just finished with a master's degree in curriculum and instruction.
Speaker 1: Where was that?
Speaker 2: Just a moment.
Speaker 1: It's okay.
Speaker 2: It will come back.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And it was an outreach program, University of Oklahoma.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes, but it was an outreach program so the program was really here in Dade County [Miami-Dade County, Florida].
Speaker 1: But you.
Speaker 2: I didn't have to go to, yes, didn't have to go there.
Speaker 1: That's a heck of a commute.
Speaker 2: Yes, and it was in curriculum and instruction.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so it was--when I finished that in '74 [1974], trying to find something and seeing the ads for the [U.S.] Bicentennial that caught my eye--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --knowing that my family had been here for a long time.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 109357
Speaker 1: What school did you get your master's degree from again?
Speaker 2: I applied to the University of Oklahoma, but did get it from the University of Northern Colorado, again an extension program, an outreach program that was here [Miami-Dade County, Florida].  And after finishing that was really looking for something--that was '74 [1974].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then kind of backed into the [U.S.] Bicentennial Project.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And I guess we should probably put you in the bigger perspective again here, you have children.  When were they born?
Speaker 2: Catherine, she'll love this, was born in 1970.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And Edda, E-D-D-A, was born in 1972.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So by '74 [1974], I have two babies and a then-husband [Eddie Fields] who decided to quit his job to go to law school fulltime.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So that I had my hands full with this idea that was just beginning to perk and my family was so supportive.  My mother [Dorothy Johnson Jenkins McKellar] and my uncles, especially Uncle Sammy and encouraged me to go ahead and try it and see what that--see what it was all about.  So I was transferred or reassigned to the Historical Museum [of Southern Florida, now HistoryMiami, Miami, Florida] and as I said earlier, I kind of learned what a historical society was and how they, how did--how it operates, never thinking that I would be one to operate one.  As the news got out that I was collecting data on local black history, I remember one person, one grandmother got on the bus and came down to, kind of a long distance, caught two or three buses to get to me at the Historical Museum in order to deposit some of her materials.
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: And then when the family came from out of town they had to get on the bus and come.  And so I, I was beginning to realize that I needed to be closer to the community.  I don't live very far from here [The Black Archives History & Research Foundation of South Florida, Inc., Miami, Florida] and I did not really notice this building when it was being built because I was busy with these babies and this building actually opened in 1977.  It's a part of the LBJ's [President Lyndon B. Johnson] Great Society.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: This is a part of the Model Cities Program, yes.  And so I was right here when it opened.  In '74 [1974]--
Speaker 1: But did it open in '67 [1967] or '77 [1977]?
Speaker 2: Seventy-seven [1977].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Seventy-seven [1977].  Again, starting in '74 [1974] when the interest peaked and I was able to get myself reassigned and the school board gave me just a half a day to do research on blacks.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: And sometimes I'd go to a retirement home and meet with someone and interview them and that would take all day.
Speaker 1: Took you half a day?
Speaker 2: And I had--yes, I had no idea what research meant. I mean I'd never done any historical research.  And I would always go home and talk to Uncle Sammy about it.  He said well see if you can find someplace that will--a school that will teach you what you need to know.  You know you are accustomed to bound volumes with--as a librarian, but there must be someplace that will teach you what to do with the feral [ph.] materials and we now know that as special collections in libraries.  So I wrote to Case Western Reserve [University, Cleveland, Ohio] and Northwestern [University, Evanston, Illinois], Columbia [University, New York City, New York], NYU [New York University, New York City, New York], all the larger library schools asking for information.  I got all the information.  My mind said, you're a graduate of Spelman [College, Atlanta, Georgia].  See what Emory [University, Atlanta, Georgia] has to offer.  And to my good fortune, Emory was having a special summer program for archives administration. It was a fairly new field that was coming on, much like public history which started I guess just a few years earlier with many of the white male PhDs who could not find jobs invented public history.  Could not find jobs and so--at the universities so they went to the outreach programs to archives and museums and places like that and actually started the field.
Story_ID: 109358
Speaker 1: So archives administration was coming on about the same time, so I wrote to Donald Stewart who was then the president of Spelman [College, Atlanta, Georgia], this is now 1977, and let him know what my--the work that I was doing and that I had a chance to get formal training in archives administration and wanted to know if I could get a dormitory room because--or two dormitory rooms because my mother [Dorothy Johnson Jenkins McKellar] was coming with me and I was going to bring my girls.  And so see, I'm doing what my mother did for me.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So you see, taking me to colleges, Syracuse [University, Syracuse, New York] and Springfield [College, Springfield, Massachusetts].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Yes, yes, yes.
Speaker 2: So I just actually just saw Dr. Stewart about two weeks ago.  So you wrote to Dr. Stewart?
Speaker 1: Yes, and asked if he could make arrangements for me to be there and he wrote back and said come on, they'd find space for me.  What I didn't know was that they had, they gave me the guest house.
Speaker 2: Oh, right, right.
Speaker 1: Yes.  That's no longer there.  That's where the Cosby Center is I guess.
Speaker 2: Right.  It was knocked down.
Speaker 1: Yes, it was knocked down.  But that's where I lived, yes, I--as I was looking for pictures today, I found pictures with my girls scampering around and my mom was there with them.  And they took dancing and they went bowling and just enjoyed the campus as I knew they would.  As knew they would because it had meant so much to me, yes when I was growing up to go to those kinds of things.
Speaker 2: So you were doing the summer program at Emory--
Speaker 1: Yes, at Emory, yes.
Speaker 2: --learning about public history, learning about archives?
Speaker 1: Archives.  It was actually archives administration.  It was while I was there, they had a field trip to Rabun Gap, Georgia where the--
Speaker 2: And where is that?
Speaker 1: --Foxfire program--
Speaker 2: Oh yes.
Speaker 1: --where they teach the children how to interview, yes.
Speaker 2: Well I, and I did a program that's a child of the Foxfire program called the Saltz [ph.] Institute in Maine.  So--
Speaker 1: Oh, is that right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Without Foxfire--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --I wouldn't be here right now.
Speaker 1: That's correct.  And I have a picture of myself with Eliot Wiggington--
Speaker 2: Wow.
Speaker 1: --who was the founder of Foxfire (laughter).
Speaker 2: That is so won--(laughter).
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Well it is now--I have officially declared it a small world today.
Speaker 1: Absolutely.  Sure, sure, sure.  And it was there that I learned about historic preservation.  I had never thought about preserving a house.  But now when I was born, my folks owned property, you see.  I mean my grandmother owned property.  She owned three houses, my grandmother and grandfather.  So owning property was not something that I--that was foreign to me but preserving it certainly was.  But it was there that I learned a lot about historic preservation.
Story_ID: 109359
Speaker 1: And so coming back from Emory [University, Atlanta, Georgia], there was turmoil at the time because they were getting ready to tear down Booker T. Washington [High School, Miami, Florida], the first [black] high school.
Speaker 2: Oh, right.
Speaker 1: Yes, because they--and I was going, started going to the meetings and they said, well you can't make a school historic.
Speaker 2: Who is they?
Speaker 1: You can't put it on the National Register [of Historic Places].  You cannot make it historic and they were coming to the meetings every week from the school system.  Now I was working for the school--still working for the school system and so we believed what they said.  About three months after the school was torn down, banner headlines in the Miami Herald, Miami Senior High [School, Miami, Florida] is on the national register so the same people I guess who were telling us that you could not make a school historic would leave our meeting, go to Miami High--
Speaker 2: And tell them--
Speaker 1: --and help them put it on the national register.
Speaker 2: Because I, I was just thinking I know that Little Rock [Central] High School [Little Rock, Arkansas]--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --is on the national register.
Speaker 1: Sure.
Speaker 2: Well that is some dirty double-dealing.  I mean, well--
Speaker 1: What's new?  What's new?  I just left a meeting last night for the Florida Department of Transportation is trying to widen the highway, the same highway that destroyed the community before and now it's going to not only destroy the highway, but it will kill the children because their, they--there's no way they can cross that highway.  They were supposed to give us a bridge--
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: --almost five years ago for the children, a walkway.  And we haven't gotten that yet. So it--
Speaker 2: Wait--
Speaker 1: --the more things change, the more they stay the same.  That's why it's important for people to know about the past, I mean really understand what happened.
Speaker 2: So they knocked down Booker T.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: What is there now?
Speaker 1: Oh, a new school.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Oh, a new Booker T.
Speaker 2: But it's not the historic building?
Speaker 1: Not the same.  It just--
Speaker 2: And was the original building in bad shape or--?
Speaker 1: Same as Miami High, yes, same as the other one.
Speaker 2: But it was important for them to make sure to preserve the white school?
Speaker 1: (No audible response.  Shrugs shoulders]
Speaker 2: Well I guess that's the history of blacks in Miami [Florida] though.  The people didn't care enough--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --to write their own history.
Speaker 1: That's what we were told.  So I've done all of this to show, we care and we're going to let you know about it.
Speaker 2: Now what year was this with the Miami v. Booker T. preservation?
Speaker 1: That was '70s [1970s].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Late '70s [1970s].
Story_ID: 109360
Speaker 1: What's happening in Florida at this time?  Like who is the governor, Lawton Chiles or--?
Speaker 2: Jeb Bush.
Speaker 1: No, no, not now.
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: That I know, god.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I meant then in the '70s [1970s] and late-'70s [1970s], early '80s [1980s].
Speaker 2: Chiles came later.  Askew, Governor Askew I think, Reubin Askew.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --may have been in the '70s [1970s] and '80s [1980s].
Speaker 1: And the Mayor of Miami [Maurice Ferre], this--because okay, in 1979, '80 [1980], you have the Marielitos--
Speaker 2: Yes, um-hmm.
Speaker 1: --which substantially changes the face of--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --of Miami [Florida].
Speaker 2: Of Miami, but we also had Haitians coming in too.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Right.  So how was that impacting what you're doing in terms of preserving black history here in Miami?
Speaker 2: Well I mean when you think about it and you think about the African diaspora, Haitians are a part of us, certainly.  And while my grand, immediate grandparents came from the Bahamas, I understand their grandparents came from Haiti and their grandparents may have come from Barbados and their grandparents from Sierra Leone.
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: And so I've learned this through oral tradition in recent times.  And so we are, you know as we collect our history, we've tried to get people to talk about their ancestry but many like me don't know that much because the ancestors did not--it wasn't a pleasant experience and they don't talk about it.  We have for instance a, an obituary collection, it started very small and now it's about five binders.  And as you look through there's research that's gone through there, there's very little history as to their grandparents.  So often, people start with themselves, you know, the world started with me.
Speaker 1: Of course.
Speaker 2: So now we're beginning to probe and to ask about ancestry because it's certainly important as we're putting this together.
Story_ID: 109361
Speaker 1: Know that the, when I finished the program at Emory [University, Atlanta, Georgia], because it was a graduate program, I had to write a paper.  And the paper that I wrote was 'The Establishment of the Black Archives,' because the instructors there knew my story, knew that my then-husband [Eddie Fields] was in law school, that I had these two babies and they even kind of joked to me that if you were white, you would probably not have to work and you could pursue this full-time. But I didn't need them to tell me that I was black and that I needed to work full-time.  But they did suggest to me that--and my paper was in fact 'The Establishment of the Black Archives Foundation.'  And I had gotten the title from the black archives that was established in Florida A&M [University, FAMU, Tallahassee, Florida]--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --many years ago.
Speaker 2: So right then you--that's the seed that is--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --now what we're sitting in was firmly planted?
Speaker 1: Yes, there.  And that I should get a board of directors and incorporate.  And I said, what's a board of directors?  They said since you work for the school system, you are going to need a--you're going to need people to sign off on the documents and to be responsible for the work that you do.  You can't do it because you work for the school system.  I knew that.  So I--but I was glad that they said it--
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: --and put it in context. So when I got back, we--I was able to get my mother's [Dorothy Johnson Jenkins McKellar] friends and my uncle's clients and my uncle's patients, you see.  I'd ask, I'd see people at a funeral or I'd see them at the grocery store and I'd say, would you be on my board?  And they say, what a--what's a board?  I said I don't know but we can find out together.  If you're retired you can give--you know I need your time right now.
Speaker 2: Right.  Not so much--
Speaker 1: And so one of the persons, a founding director, Ms. Leome [Scavella] Culmer has been on the board since the first day, since 1977.  And when you go to these board retreats and board management programs they tell you, oh change your board every three years.  Don't let anybody be on there more than--if I had done that, I wouldn't have an organization.  And I got people who could give the credibility because they lived the history.  They were so much a part of it that once they--and you know when people give interviews that's one thing.  But we always go back and check information that they give, dates and institutions, that kind of thing just so we can anchor what they have done.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And so from the interviews we were then able to go back to the census, to the city directories, to primary sources, published sources that would help to anchor the interviews.
Story_ID: 109362
Speaker 1: So when you incorporate, what is the first project that the Black Archives [History & Research Foundation of South Florida, Miami, Florida], I say, you know, a larger project that you start working on?
Speaker 2: My shock was going, coming to the first meetings and everybody here and they were all--they're about twenty years my senior for the most part and my--of my mother's [Dorothy Johnson Jenkins McKellar] friends.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: They're twenty and thirty years my mother's senior.  I mean, my senior.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: My mother's friends.  But they were all excited and talking, couldn't start the meeting each time because they're all excited about Overtown [formerly Colored Town, neighborhood in Miami, Florida] and while they had been forced to move out like many others--
Speaker 1: Because--?
Speaker 2: Because of the expressway that was coming in.
Speaker 1: And which ones, 95?
Speaker 2: Ninety-five, I-95.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.  And in high school I remember them, the teachers taking us to the library, to the community library, the Dorsey [Memorial] Library and we were told that there was going to be a highway in the sky and we had to do an essay on the highway in the sky.
Speaker 1: The sky.
Speaker 2: I'll never forget that.  That's the expressway.  Now I know.
Speaker 1: Right, right, but--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --it sounded so lofty.
Speaker 2: Yes, that there was going to be a high--and when you're adults you're going to be riding on a highway in the sky.  And so we want you to think about what that's going to be like and what you will do and how that would work.  So they took us to the library to go to 'World Book Encyclopedia.'  Well 'World Book' didn't have anything like that in it.  So I wish I had kept whatever I wrote, but of course I didn't.
Speaker 1: That would be interesting.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So yes, I mean now at this point in the early-'80s [1980s], 95 [I-95] has already cut through Overtown because it was--
Speaker 2: Yes, it was in the--but it was, it wasn't until the 60s [1960s] that it came through.  I thought it was going to be earlier than that.  In fact, my uncle moved us out in 1948.
Speaker 1: Oh, 'cause they had already--
Speaker 2: (Unclear) there had been talk about it, you see.  Understand that Downtown [Miami, Florida] and Overtown are adjacent communities and just the streets separate them.  So Downtown has been wanting to expand and the natural expansion would be through Overtown.  So the whole idea was to wipe out Overtown and I don't know that there was any understanding that that had developed into a vibrant community.  Sometimes I think we give white people too much credit thinking that they know you know since they have entitled themselves, that we go along with that assuming that they have all the answers.  But as I understand it now and looking at the historical record, it was a matter of them wanting to expand Downtown and the natural expansion would have been west.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And we were just in their way.
Story_ID: 109363
Speaker 1: Now they knew about the night light--the night life in Overtown [formerly Colored Town, neighborhood in Miami, Florida].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: The hotels and the nightclubs and the first-rate restaurants that we had.  I mean it was a self-contained community unlike Coconut Grove [neighborhood in Miami, Florida] and Richmond Heights [Florida] and Seminola [neighborhood in Hialeah, Florida] which was settled by blacks and Seminoles near Hialeah [Florida] and even Brownsville [Florida].  Those were all bedroom communities. But Overtown because it was adjacent to Downtown [Miami, Florida], was in fact a self-contained community so that you didn't really have to leave Overtown to buy clothes because there was a seamstress in every house almost I mean who were professionals who did professional work.  You could go to a tailor and they had tailor shops, actually had standalone buildings [ph.].  You could buy a hat that was done--we had a shoemaker, Mr. Donald Evans not only repaired shoes but he made them.  He was from the Bahamas, he had the tools that would cut out the shoe, the leather, sew the leather to the sole, punch the holes for the shoe strings and so that you could be one of a kind.  Now if you went Downtown and bought shoes that you could not try on--
Speaker 2: Oh right, let's, yeah, let's describe what is life like for blacks in Downtown.  So you can't sit at the lunch counters, no--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --eating in the restaurants?
Speaker 1: Could not eat in restaurants, you could not try on clothes, getting ready for the prom, you could look at something and point to it and you couldn't take it back if it didn't fit.
Speaker 2: That was a nice little expensive prom dress.
Speaker 1: And we laugh out of, we're--you know, we laughed out of disgust and we laughed out of emotion because it is not funny.  But that's the way you lived.  And I know when Uncle Sammy came back in 1939, I hear he came back from Meharry [Medical College, Nashville, Tennessee], a newly licensed--had passed the test, newly licensed medical doctor.  Went Downtown to buy a new suit and try on shoes, Nashville like Miami hadn't changed.  This is '39 [1939].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So he thought because he was a medical doctor that it would make a diff--it didn't make any difference--boy, you know.
Speaker 2: Get out.
Speaker 1: Yes, yes, yes.  And he too had to use a string to measure his foot for his shoes.  And when he had patients, a patient in particular who had a broken kneecap and took them to City Hospital, at first they didn't wait on him at all and then about twelve hours later, they waited on him and then would not let my uncle read the X-ray.  They were going to mail it to him.  He said well it will set by that time.  They said well, we can't have you coming in here reading X-rays.  So out of great personal sacrifice, he closed his office next year.  Where do you think he went?  Cook County Hospital in Chicago [Illinois]--
Speaker 2: Oh!
Speaker 1: --to do his fellowship in radiology, Cook County Hospital.
Speaker 2: County Hospital up there in Chicago.
Speaker 1: Yes, in Chicago, yes uh-huh.  Yes, uh-huh, and then also to St. Louis [Missouri].
Speaker 2: Oh, was he a, at Homer G. Phillips [Hospital]?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Yes.  My dad did his residency there.
Speaker 1: Both of them were with Homer G. Phillips, oh okay.  Uh-huh. (Laughter).
Speaker 2: That's--and my dad went to Meharry.
Speaker 1: See, of course.  No, he didn't go to Meharry--
Speaker 2: Well right, but--
Speaker 1: --he graduated from Meharry.
Speaker 2: Oh yes.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: That's right. I'm sorry.  He graduated.
Speaker 1: Graduated.  Going and graduating are two different things.
Speaker 2: I was like, well no he did--yes.  Yes, you're right.  You're right.
Story_ID: 109364
Speaker 1: So, you know and I'm kind of looking at the map here and that's why it's really on my mind.  So everyone is excited.  What are they excited about in terms of the Black Archives [& Research Foundation of South Florida, Miami, Florida] and Overtown [formerly Colored Town, neighborhood in Miami, Florida]?  What is it that's--has everyone's energy up so?
Speaker 2: Well, I guess we are one of the first comm--one of the first organizations to really be able to collect the history.  I mean, there are people older than I am: [HM] Thelma Gibson, [HM] Enid Pinkney, Eunice Liberty who is with the National Council of Negro Women and she actually got this space that we're in now.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And we worked with her for some time.  Ms. Nathalie Range [ph.] and others who even before my birth thought about doing something like this.  But this was the first organization to actually collect the data from people.  And then with me going to get certification in archives administration so that I could be trained to do it was an important part of the process of preserving and making available to students and teachers and scholars the history of the community of people of Miami-Dade County.  And so beyond, and then beyond collecting primary source materials, because I had learned about historic preservation at Emory [University, Atlanta, Georgia] when I was at the Emory program, started looking at buildings.  And when I got back from Emory, one of the first meetings that we had, people were just chit-chatting and I said please come to order, please come to order, they were just so excited the possibility of being to--being able to be a part of preserving this.  Finally after the third or fourth meeting because we couldn't get anything done, people were just talking, got in the cars, everybody get in your car.  Let's ride through.  Many of them had not been back since they were forced out in the '60s [1960s].
Speaker 1: So once 95 [I-95] was built and people were forcibly displaced--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: They didn't even like buyout their land, they just went--took it by eminent domain?
Speaker 2: Eminent domain and you know gave them a few dollars for it.  Most people didn't have pictures of their homes.  They never thought they were going to leave.  This was home.  You never expected someone to come to--you never expected to get a letter that said because a highway is going to be built, we're taking your property by eminent domain.  You should be out in the next three months.  Here, you'll get some money to buy property.  And--
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: --it was sobering.  Now there were--there will be people who say well there were some public meetings.  There were no meaningful public meetings.  People who worked for white people, they had been told that there's going to be a meeting.  But there was no public stand and blacks were too intimidated.  I mean there were--Florida was one of the places where according to the NAACP's [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] records, had the most lynchings in the--at the turn of the 20th Century.  And intimidation is an awful thing and a lot of things are done through intimidation.
Speaker 1: So what, and really, and the wheels have been set into motion as you said in the -40, late '40s [1940s] so when segregation and Jim Crow were still very strong. So despite the Civil Rights Movement by the '60s [1960s], nothing seems to have affected that.  They were going to build it and it didn't matter--
Speaker 2: Oh yes.  Oh yes, because it was--well the reason that Booker T. [Washington High School, Miami, Florida] did not open on time, it was built in '26 [1926] but didn't open until '27 [1927], was because it--of the hurricane, but more than that it was damaged because it was bombed because it was supposed to have been too close to 7th Avenue, the main artery that took whites from Downtown Miami to the suburbs.  It was bombed.  The school was bombed.  The principal called the other day and said--in fact she sent one of her--she sent the social studies teacher over to get some information on the school because they wanted to have a celebration for the opening of the school.  I said well no, not this year, it's next year.  She said it was built in '26 [1926].  I said, but it didn't open in '26 [1926], couldn't open 'cause it was bombed.
Speaker 1: Wow!
Speaker 2: That's a part of the history.  Sure, yes, uh-huh.  So it didn't open until February of '28 [1928]--
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: I mean '27 [1927].
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: Twenty-seven [1927], sure.
Story_ID: 110048
Speaker 1: And who else would you see on the streets of Colored Town [now Overtown, Miami, Florida]?
Speaker 2: Yes.  As a student at Booker T. Washington [High School, Miami, Florida] sometime in the afternoon, you would see Nat King Cole.  In fact he would come to the, they would all come to the school.  And we have a picture of him teaching Bobbie Kendrick [ph.], one of the children how to play the piano.  Muhammad Ali later on of course, you'd see all the time.  He even bought a home in this area.  He lived at the Carver Hotel.  And whenever he was here, he and his entourage took up the entire third floor.  Marian Anderson at the Lyric Theater, Langston Hughes--oh, I didn't bring my book that he autographed for me.
Speaker 1: Oh wow, you met him.
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yes, I met him.  And my mother [Dorothy Johnson Jenkins McKellar] had him autograph a book for me.  I don't remember meeting him, but evidently I did.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And then we have a copy of the program.  Mary McLeod Bethune was here and I have this--the guest book.  My mother's, my-my mother didn't go.  My grandmother signed in, my Aunt Roberta signed in 'cause Aunt Bert drove that day, yes, uh-huh, for Mrs. Bethune.  But it was just a place where--oh, and Georgia Campbell, my godmother who had a place on 125th Street and Lenox [Avenue, New York City, New York], was in fact moved to Miami [Florida], had a restaurant on 2nd Avenue and then had a tea house in Brown Sub, now Brownsville [Florida].  And that's where I met Billie Holiday.
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: Yes, and her chihuahua.
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: So the stars were in and out.
Speaker 1: Yes, it was very, obviously a very vibrant--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --place that in throwing a major highway and a secondary artery through did what?
Speaker 2: Destroyed it, absolutely destroyed it.
Speaker 1: The population went from what, 40,000--?
Speaker 2: From 40,000 to last count I think was about 8,000.
Speaker 1: And it's now--I, in my research saw that the real estate here is the cheapest real estate in all of Miami-Dade [County, Florida] and the people who live here are the poorest--
Speaker 2: No, no, no the real estate is not cheap.  Oh absolutely not.
Speaker 1: Not, no not inexpensive.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: But that it's less expensive than anywhere else--
Speaker 2: No, I don't think so.  The real estate here now is--has skyrocketed.
Speaker 1: What, in the last five years or last ten years?
Speaker 2: Yes, um-hmm.
Speaker 1: Yeah, this is not--
Speaker 2: Has developed.
Speaker 1: This is not dated.  Overtown has one of the highest poverty rates and the worst and cheapest housing in Miami-Dade County.
Speaker 2: Cheapest housing but that's not, housing not necessarily talking about the--
Speaker 1: Not land?
Speaker 2: --real estate, the dirt?
Speaker 1: No, no.
Speaker 2: Oh, okay.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes, um-hmm.
Story_ID: 110049
Speaker 1: So your passion now is to, I mean it seems like it's to do more than just collect the stories of the people who are here--
Speaker 2: Well we identify buildings of historical significance and one was the Lyric Theater.  I'd never been in the Lyric although my mother's family--my mother [Dorothy Johnson Jenkins McKellar] was born just two blocks north of the Lyric.  I--when we got in the car and went by, it was so neglected.  The roof was off, the stench was awful.  The homeless were living in there.  There were mattresses piled up and--
Speaker 1: Now the Lyric was so vital in the--
Speaker 2: In the early days.
Speaker 1: --(unclear) because it was black owned--?
Speaker 2: Black owned and operated.  Geder Walker, a black man from Georgia came to Miami [Florida] at the turn of the 20th Century, and a businessman.  He went to Paris [France] and saw the opera houses there, decided that he wanted an opera house in Miami's Colored Town [now Overtown, neighborhood in Miami, Florida] and built it in 1913.  And that's the building that stands now.
Speaker 1: So it was in decline--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --by when, when you were a child or a teen or when?
Speaker 2: When I was a teen and so he built it in 1913.  It opened, and I didn't know to ask Aunt Bert about that until very late.  She said she was there when it opened, the day it opened.
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: That it was a cowboy movie because it was both a movie house and vaudeville stage.  And traveling troops would come in, Marian Anderson was there, Langston Hughes, more culture than entertainment and the people separated the two.  The nightclubs was entertainment, but the culture, the graduation from--the high school graduations and the concerts and everything were at the Lyric Theater.  And it was really a very important part of the community with the traveling troops like [HM] Etta Moten [Barnett] would come in--
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: Yes, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Another HistoryMaker.
Speaker 2: Yes.  So it was important and in the '40s [1950s] it started decline, declining.  Daddy Grace [Marcelino Manuel da Graca] bought it late Forties, early '50s [1950s] and we actually bought it from Daddy Grace, Daddy Grace's people.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.  But it was a church and that's important.  It's possible that that's the only reason that it remained, it remained because all of the nightclubs and the hotels for whatever reason had all been torn down.  Any places of significance for entertainment had all been razed--
Speaker 1: With nothing in their place?
Speaker 2: --with nothing in their place and all left vacant.  But this that was known to have been a church remained and it was not known that it had been a theater.  And when we went by and looked at it, I got home and I went to Uncle Sammy and I said we went by, we went by the Lyric Theater and he sat up straight, he said oh, I hope you can save that.  Mr. Geder Walker was the one who built it from the ground up and it should be saved.
Speaker 1: Now you had never even heard that story before at that point?
Speaker 2: No, no, no, no.  I mean you can't save other peoples' property.
Speaker 1: True.
Speaker 2: Somebody would have to buy it.  You know I thought, save, oh no, so I knew he wasn't talking to me.  That was for somebody else.  But it was one of those vistas that he had opened and continued to bother me.  And at one point and there's a picture of me with a hatchet actually--well that was the Dorsey House, but actually going in to the Lyric Theater looking at it and realizing that if a black man built this, we have to save it.  We can't let this be torn down.  So that's how I got into historic preservation and since we have saved the Dorsey House, Uncle Sammy's X-ray clinic, he came back from Cook County Hospital [Chicago, Illinois] and built his own clinic.
Speaker 1: Okay, so he didn't have to wait--
Speaker 2: That's correct.
Speaker 1: --for them to mail--?
Speaker 2: That's correct.  And so he--we--he gave that to the Black Archives [History & Research Foundation of South Florida] --
Speaker 1: Oh wow.
Speaker 2: --to honor me and so we now own that and we're getting that restored, yes.
Speaker 1: It's good to have a big family.
Speaker 2: Yes, it is.  And so as a part of that--so the Lyric really is the anchor, one of the anchors for the development of a complex that will include the Folk Life Village.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I see the Harlem Renaissance as a model.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And so I see it as a Harlem Renaissance of the South and so we're doing a cottage industry--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --in a two, three block area that will provide work, live-work units for the literary, visual, performing, culinary arts and fashions.
Speaker 1: Wow.  So--and where is that going to be located?
Speaker 2: Second Avenue to 3rd Avenue.  Well actually 3rd Avenue to 1st Avenue.  We have expanded it.  We have a new commissioner, Commissioner Spence, Michelle Spence-Jones who has just been in office since December.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And she has been working in the community, really a grassroots person and she shares the vision for the Lyric and for the Folk Life Village.  And so she has suggested that we expand the boundaries from--to 2nd Avenue or 3rd Avenue to 1st Avenue--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and 8th Street to 11th Street.  And so in that contained area we will have the--will be the Historic Overtown Folk Life District--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --for a cottage village or a cottage industry--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --for the literary, visual, performing, culinary and fashion arts.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 110050
Speaker 1: Now I want to jump back into the Lyric [Theater].  What year did you start working on the Lyric project?  I know you had to purchase the property--
Speaker 2: In 1988, and we got the money from the State of Florida.  It was a, what they call, pork--a turkey project, a project that Jimmy Burke [James Burke] who was a state legislator asked if there was something that we needed and I--'cause I was always asking for something to preserve the history.  And I told him yes, we wanted to buy the Lyric Theater.  He said, how much is it?  Fifty-thousand dollars.  So he was able to put that in his legislation and get that for us.  And then the [D. A.] Dorsey House which we also owned and re--had to reconstruct because it was in such bad condition.  We had to do measure drawings in order to reconstruct it and recreate it the way it once was.  And then the X-ray clinic is the other one that we own.  And as a result of my research, there are six buildings, including three churches that are now on the National Register of Historic Places.
Speaker 1: Well, I will do another question about that part.  Now how long did it take to restore--
Speaker 2: Re--acquired it in '88 [1988], opened in 2000.
Speaker 1: Long process.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: What were some of the things that--?
Speaker 2: Money.
Speaker 1: Just plain old--
Speaker 2: Money.
Speaker 1: --greenbacks.
Speaker 2: No dedicated funding.  We still don't have dedicated funding for any of our work.
Speaker 1: So you're constantly requesting--?
Speaker 2: Yes, grants.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Fighting grants, yes.  And it just took all of that time to--you know you get the money and then you--and of course know that I'm still, all this time now I'm still working for the school system.
Speaker 1: You're still teaching.
Speaker 2: I'm still teaching.
Speaker 1: That's right, you--
Speaker 2: Yes, uh-huh, uh-huh.  And this became my work, this really became my work so I didn't have to go to a classroom, this became my classroom.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And students would come here for research, yes.  But I'm still working for the school system.  I have a growing family.
Speaker 1: That's right you have--they're going to high school--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: --and college.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.  And in order to get money you have to go to all these meetings.  Last night for instance I was in Overtown [neighborhood in Miami, Florida] at a meeting of the Overtown Advisory Board.  Almost every night there is a meeting you have to go to, to present yourself, to present your project, to convince people.
Speaker 1: Do you ever get tired?
Speaker 2: [No audible response - laughter].
Speaker 1: Or are you superhuman?
Speaker 2: Tired all the time.  But you get tired, you stop and rest and you start again.  This is life's work.
Story_ID: 110051
Speaker 1: Well, you know, I wanted to talk a little about the infrastructure of restoring and preserving the Lyric [Theater, Miami, Florida].  It's been abandoned as you said for decades.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: So that's what, the roof and the walls and ceiling and--
Speaker 2: Had to be restored, yes.  And now my master's [degree] in, was in education.  I didn't know anything about architecture.  But while I was at the Historic Museum [of Southern Florida, now HistoryMiami], they were talking about assistance through the county (unclear) preservation board.  And I got myself, thanks to then Commissioner Barbara Carey[-Shuler] who had became the black commissioner, I got myself assigned to that and I stayed on it twenty-too many years.  But it was through that process that I learned what historic preservation really meant because people would have to come to our board and present themselves and present their work because once your property is designated locally, then you have to go back, to the board each time you want to make a change.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: Yes.  So I would read, stay up all night and read all of that you see, and that's how I learned what to do and what to ask for, yes.  But talking about being tired, there were several years when I first started that I would go home from the school system or from the Historical Museum, wherever my meeting took me.  I would you know have to get dinner ready, play with the children.  My mother [Dorothy Johnson Jenkins McKellar] lived next door so I have some you know interaction with her and with my husband [Eddie Fields], put the children to bed and put him to sleep and from midnight until six o'clock in the morning, I stayed up all night.
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: All night preparing--by now we had space here at the Caleb Center and my mother used her retirement check to help pay for someone to be at the--here at the office.
Speaker 1: Really?
Speaker 2: Yes.  And--but I would stay up all night and answer the questions that people would ask on the phone, type it up, put it under the door for the young lady to come and called them back just as if I was in the office, give the information and then she'd get more questions.  And February was just unreal, unreal.
Speaker 1: As you were saying--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --earlier.  So--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 110052
Speaker 1: You also mentioned earlier they're trying to widen what is it, 395 or 95 or 836, which--?
Speaker 2: I-90--I think it's 395.
Speaker 1: [I-]395.  So your battle isn't just to preserve things but it's also to prevent further destruction?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Now how is that coming about?  I mean that seems like a very daunting--
Speaker 2: Like everything else.
Speaker 1: --project (laughter).
Speaker 2: But never stopped us before.  No, but it--and the people have to be educated and they have to know what has happened in the past, what's happening now and what can happen in the future and we have options.  We didn't have options before.
Speaker 1: Right, because you were hired by FIU [Florida International University, Miami, Florida] to conduct--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: --that study.
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: So that's what--that's why I was kind of honing in on that.
Speaker 2: Yes.  And they didn't know when that RFP went out, request for proposals went out, it was never the thought that there was someone in the community who could do that.  And I say that because it was a very short window of time.  I don't think that RFP was out more than two weeks, ten days maybe and it was such an--a daunting request, all the things you had to do--
Speaker 1: And the request was find out if the highways had negatively impacted Overtown [neighborhood in Miami, Florida]?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.  But I mean the way the proposal was put together, it was impossible for somebody to do, to even to write the proposal in such a short period of time.  I looked at it when it came across my desk and threw it in the trashcan.  And--
Speaker 1: Ten days.
Speaker 2: Yes.  And then a number of people called me and said, are you applying?  I said no, I'm not going to apply for that.  Said well you really need to apply for that.  And the people who put it together had no idea.  The university was going to be paid to do it.  They didn't expect to outsource it, the university was going to do it.
Speaker 1: But they couldn't--?
Speaker 2: They couldn't--well it wouldn't have been the same.
Speaker 1: Because they don't have--
Speaker 2: Right, right, right, right.  That's why I was encouraged to do it.  So I applied for it and we got it.  Oh sure.
Speaker 1: And how long did it take for you to, in the end to put that RFP together?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think it was about what, three months or so.
Speaker 1: Wow, from ten days?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Oh you mean to actually put the proposal together?
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Oh no, we waited within the ten days.
Speaker 1: Oh okay, but your research time--?
Speaker 2: Sure, yes, yes, yes.
Speaker 1: So--which has been--
Speaker 2: And we knew everything to do, to get a videotographer [sic], we had everything lined up.  I mean, those are the people we work with everyday, so it wasn't a problem.
Story_ID: 110053
Speaker 1: --see, that's what I find so interesting is that it's not--the archive is not just a repository for knowledge, but it is also an advocate.
Speaker 2: Yes, absolutely.
Speaker 1: And I mean when I think of archive, I just think of it as being a dusty--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --moldy place.  So--
Speaker 2: I'm an active archivist and a member of the Society of American Archivists.  Remember I told you that my mother [Dorothy Johnson Jenkins McKellar] was very much a part of whatever prof--whatever her profession.  Whatever she was doing she always went to the zenith with it.  So that I'm a member of the Society of American Archivists and--
Speaker 1: Well you also have your PhD as well.
Speaker 2: Went to college--
Speaker 1: That--you have to tell--
Speaker 2: Want me to tell that story?  Yes.
Speaker 1: Tell that story of you being in the registrar's office.
Speaker 2: Office and they wanted to know whether I understood because I was signing for a student loan, that I would be in my eighties paying the student loan back.
Speaker 1: Because you were how old when you started?
Speaker 2: Because I was fifty years old, yes, in 1992.
Speaker 1: And you went to Union--
Speaker 2: The Union Institute, University [Union Institute & University] it's called now, in Cincinnati, Ohio.  And they actually had an outreach program here [Miami-Dade County, Florida]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --that the people from the University of Northern Colorado flew in every two weeks.  But the Union Institute actually has a program here--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --that was established oh, I guess in the early 1990s, and they started off as an undergraduate program.  And it's a wonderful, wonderful program because it provides an opportunity for you to continue your work 'cause a lot of schools do that now.
Speaker 1: Right, right, but that was pretty--
Speaker 2: But they--that was--
Speaker 1: --innovative then.
Speaker 2: Yes, at that time.  And then they started a Ph.D. program and I was in the first doctoral program that they started in 1992, oh about a month after Hurricane Andrew.
Speaker 1: Oh (unclear).
Speaker 2: So we actually drove to their campus over live wires and through puddles and over fallen trees to get there.
Speaker 1: Very dedicated.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 110054
Speaker 1: But I'd always wanted a Ph.D. and so I must say something about my children before I--
Speaker 2: Well yes, yes.
Speaker 1: --before it ends.  Catherine and Edda were two and four when I started in 1974, and they have certainly been very much a part of everything that I do.  I use to drag them to meetings and never thought that they were paying attention to anything.  And I was very surprised when Edda was at Emory [University, Atlanta, Georgia]--well Edda got to Emory because I had gone to Emory for certification archives administration.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And she--and they lived on Spelman's [Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia] campus.  So when it was time for them to go to college, I just assumed that they would both go to Spelman.  And Catherine didn't really care one way or another and so we got her application to Spelman and she was fine.  The little one, no, I don't want to go there.  I want to go to the other school that you went to.  And I guess she thought I had gotten a master's [degree] or something there.  She didn't know what I had done there but she knew--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --I was there.  Didn't want to go to the same school as her sister and so wound up going to Emory University.  And the first two or three weeks that she was there, there was a rape and there was a racial situation and immediately she turned to the black students because both she and her sister were graduates of Carrollton School of the Sacred Heart, which was all-white in Coconut Grove [neighborhood in Miami, Florida].
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: So this was really--she had not had that much contact with black students in school.  But this racial incident was something that really, really concerned her and she decided that she was going to find out more about black history because she hadn't been very interested before to put it mildly.  So she--I was shocked in her junior year when she informed her dad [Eddie Fields] and I that she was majoring in English and African History, to the point--and she became so interested in it that she I think was the first person in this history department at Emory University to request a summer internship or a summer program in Africa.  And they said, sure, let her go.  You know she'll never come back.  She'll be lost.  (Laughter).
Speaker 2: That's terrible.
Speaker 1: So she went to Sierra Leone, yes.
Speaker 2: Ah, yes, came back.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: (BRIEF INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 1: Okay, so--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So she goes there for her internship--
Speaker 2: Yes, and again that was before--no, that was after I learned that my families may have originally come from Sierra Leone.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: And I really need to do that DNA--
Speaker 1: Oh, right.
Speaker 2: --to find out what that has to say about it.  And so her career has just moved forward in the field of history, which of course is something that pleases me, the fact that we get to do a lot of things together--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --because of that.
Speaker 1: Did she go to Penn?
Speaker 2: She graduated from--
Speaker 1: Yes--did she graduate from Penn?
Speaker 2: Yes, oh yes.  Oh yeah.  She graduated from the University of Pennsylvania [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].
Speaker 1: With a degree in--?
Speaker 2: She was a Fulbright Scholar, University of Pennsylvania--well University of Florida [Gainesville, Florida] with a master's.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And she was asked to transfer to University of Pennsylvania.
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: Yes.  She and another student transferred with Steve Feierman [Steven Feierman] who is one of the top people in African History and then she became a Fulbright Scholar and she did her teaching assistantship at Oberlin [College, Oberlin, Ohio] and that's where she met Sam Black [Samuel Black], who was in Cleveland at the Historical Society, Cleveland Historical Society.  And they married about I guess 2002, and live now in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.  And Sam is a curator at the [Senator] John Heinz History Center and Edda [Fields-Black] is on the faculty at Carnegie Mellon [University, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania].
Speaker 1: Which is where our digital archive is going to be housed.
Speaker 2: Is that right?
Speaker 1: Yes, which I just realized I had not mentioned to you so, yeah.
Speaker 2: Oh my goodness.
Speaker 1: Okay, I'm declaring for the second time--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --it is officially a small world.
Speaker 2: Oh that's wonderful.
Speaker 1: So yes, she probably knows a lot about this or you know at least has probably heard more about it than the average person.
Speaker 2: Yes, and she will--
Speaker 1: We have to talk to her.
Speaker 2: Yes, absolutely.  And I think it was Sam who was one of those at least who recommended me for this project.
Speaker 1: Oh, and that's probably why--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --because they knew about it from--well--
Speaker 2: Yes, it's a small world.  Yeah, we'll have to write a song.
Speaker 1: I can see the words now.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And Catherine of course is living in Brooklyn, New York and works for Time Warner Cable and is just such an exciting person.  She works and lives and loves New York.  When she comes home to visit she watches all the New York stories.  She brings The New Yorker, she brings The New York Times. (Laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter)  Like she would shrivel up if she doesn't have it.
Speaker 1: Yes, yes, yes, yes.  So it's always fun when I get to go there to visit her.  And last year I had the opportunity to go when she was inducted into the Greater New York Links Chapter, The Links, Incorporated.  And of course I'm a member of the Greater Miami Chapter of The Links, Incorporated.  And I was honored for the 50th anniversary for our chapter--
Speaker 2: Oh wow.
Speaker 1: --this--the past year.
Story_ID: 110055
Speaker 1: One of my mentors in my work is [HM] John Hope Franklin.  I met him more, I guess about fifteen years ago as I was attending the ASLH conferences, Association for the Study of African American Life and History, the organization that was founded by Carter G. Woodson.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And of course we have the Miami-Dade [County] chapter here [Miami, Florida] as a part of the [Black] Archives [History & Research Foundation of South Florida].  And Dr. Franklin was in Miami, in fact, just last November as a part of the book fair for Miami-Dade College [Miami, Florida], and we helped to promote his book and--
Speaker 2: Right, his biography.
Speaker 1: His autobiography ['Mirror to America: The Autobiography of John Hope Franklin'], yes, yes, yes.  But he's been instrumental in helping me in my work as we collect this local history.  Primarily my work is in the era of Jim Crow, the Jim Crow period from the Civil War to the 1964 legislation.  And for Miami, it's 1896, the year in which Miami became a city, incorporated because a third of the men who stood as incorporators were black.
Speaker 2: And that's beautiful.
Speaker 1: And so that's the story that I tell.
