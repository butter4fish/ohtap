Speaker 1: --okay, and your grandfather's name?
Speaker 2: On my father's side?
Speaker 1: On your mother's side.
Speaker 2: John Sibley.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now you told me off camera that you can, that you do know the name of your great gran- great-grandfather?  In other words, your mother's grandfather, is that right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  Yes my--they were my mother's, on my mother's side.
Speaker 1: Right.  We're talking about your mother's side.
Speaker 2: My mother's side.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Okay.  His name is, I'll think about it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Let me think about.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: I don't wanna mess it up.
Speaker 1: All right.  Well, let's talk about your grandparents then until you can think about your great-grandfather.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Tell me about your great, great--no your grandmother and grandfather, John and Jessie.
Speaker 2: Jessie Lee Downs was from northern Louisiana, well actually from, from around the Cane River area, she was a graduate of Grambling College [North Louisiana Agricultural and Industrial School; Grambling State University, Grambling, Louisiana] and she was a great, loved to fish, and in the Louisiana tradition she was mulatto, and she was a--she taught school for forty years or so at, in Columbia, Columbia, Louisiana, under the name of Jessie Lee Downs, when she married her second husband [Leon Downs].  And we got our inspiration from her, she loved her alma mater, Grambling College, and she loved to fish and cook fish and she was a real fun person.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Can you remember or share any stories about personal time spent with her or--
Speaker 2: Why certainly--
Speaker 1: --things she might have told you?
Speaker 2: --all of my summers were spent in West Monroe, Louisiana, where she was, where she was staying and I played a lot of baseball there and she always gave us a lot of things, in my family it's all about work and education.  And so the interesting thing about grandmother was that she would come in and say, we going fishing today?  And I could remember when I finished high school [Washington Parish High School, Franklinton, Louisiana] that she was my biggest supporter in going to, to LSU, Louisiana State University [Baton Rouge, Louisiana], were I went, I had a brother [Terry Earl Butler] at Indiana University [Bloomington, Indiana] at the time.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And all of the daughters had gone to Dillard University in New Orleans [Louisiana].  So, she was always about encouragement, about education, and doing things.
Speaker 1: Tell me about where she lived, about the area.  Was it city, was it in the country?
Speaker 2: She lived in the city.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Of West Monroe.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Now what about your grandfather?
Speaker 2: My grandfather, John Sibley, was a musician, he was from Cane River, just south of Natchitoches [Louisiana].  He did lots of things, but he played guitar and sang in blues facilities around Natchitoches and southern Louisiana.  And, I don't know much about him, he was older, but I shared his name and I also play guitar, so maybe I am the reincarnation of John Sibley.
Speaker 1: So he didn't, never had the opportunity to teach you to play the guitar?
Speaker 2: No, he never taught me to play the guitar--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --but I can remember when I was sitting at the--in Greensburg, Louisiana, which is the home place of my father [Thojest Butler, Sr.], St. Helena [St. Helena Parish, Louisiana].  And his sister came out and said, "Well my, gosh, you look just like your grandfather sitting there playing and singing, playing the guitar."  So, that's what I know about John Sibley.
Story_ID: 632966
Speaker 1: Did your [maternal] grandmother [Jessie Cahee Downs] remarry and did you get to know your, I guess step-grandfather?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Jessie Lee Downs.  Was the step-grandfather that I knew.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: Worked for the Louisiana Power and Light Company [Entergy Louisiana] for years, died at a late age.
Speaker 1: Tell me his name again?
Speaker 2: Leon Downs.
Speaker 1: Leon Downs.
Speaker 2: D-O-W-N-S.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right, tel- go ahead continue.
Speaker 2: And he worked for Louisiana Power and Light Company.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He was a lineman, you know, that dealt in electricity and power, and was a great person and was really involved in all of our lives and doing great things and making sure that we do great things.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He bought me all of my sporting equipment as a kid, baseball gloves and baseball bats because I played a lot of little league ball in West Monroe, Louisiana as a kid growing up.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, have you thought about your great-grandfather's name?  Okay, were there any stories shared about anyone in your family being in slavery?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I know that on my grandmother's side that his, that her father was a medical doctor and he sent her to college in a nice automobile.  And, but there was no sharing of slave stories by the time I came of age.
Story_ID: 632967
Speaker 1: All right, let's talk about your father's side of the family.  Tell me your father's name?
Speaker 2: Thojest Jefferson Butler [Thojest Butler, Sr.].
Speaker 1: Spell it please?
Speaker 2: T-H-O-J-E-S-T, J-E-F-F-E-R-S-O-N, B-U-T-L-E-R.
Speaker 1: All right, and do you know when he was born?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Eighteen seventy [1870].
Speaker 1: This is your father?
Speaker 2: This is my father's father.
Speaker 1: Okay, so this is your grandfather?
Speaker 2: That's my grandfather.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Tell me your grandmother's name?
Speaker 2: My grandmother's, on my, on my fa--?
Speaker 1: On your father's side.
Speaker 2: On my father's side?
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: Mrs. Butler (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.  You didn't call her grandmother?
Speaker 2: Called her Grandmother Butler.
Speaker 1: You didn't know her first name?
Speaker 2: Anna [Anna Butler (ph.)].
Speaker 1: Anna?
Speaker 2: Anna.
Speaker 1: Okay--
Speaker 2: She died (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) and tell--
Speaker 2: --early too.
Speaker 1: Oh she, okay.
Speaker 2: When I was seven.
Speaker 1: Do you remember anything about her?
Speaker 2: She sent, she, it was the first family in Louisiana who sent all her kids to college.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And she was an entrepreneurial type, she baked and she, she sold stuff and, she cooked and, but she died when I was seven.
Speaker 1: Seven, okay.  Tell me about your grandfather?
Speaker 2: Grandfather was a, worked for a life insurance company, or insurance company, one of the black insurance companies and was interested in buying land and educating his children and sent all of his kids to, to college and they all graduated from college.  And so, it was interesting growing up, all of my uncles and aunties had finished school and had gone to graduate school at Michigan [University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan], Michigan State [Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan] and other great northern schools.
Speaker 1: Where did they live?
Speaker 2: St. Helena Parish [Louisiana], Greensburg, Louisiana, G-R-E-E-N-S-B-U-R-G.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Are there any other stories about your grandfather and grandmother, this is on your father's side?
Speaker 2: On my father's side?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Well, I think it was pretty interesting.  Again, I think the value structure was there, the emphasis on buying things, the emphasis on land ownership, emphasis on the education of children.  And it really came out of the, I guess the Booker T. Washington philosophy, that if you were somebody to the extent that you owned land, and educated your children and built a house.
Speaker 1: Okay, so both your grandparents both owned their own homes?  They had land?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, any stories on the family mixture on your father's side?
Speaker 2: I don't know any mixture on my father's side, I think it's Indian [Native American].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But certainly on my mother's [Johnnie Mae Sibley Butler] side it's something else.
Speaker 1: All right.  Now tell me your father's name?
Speaker 2: Thojest Jefferson Butler.
Speaker 1: So he's a junior?  I thought that was your grandfather's name?
Speaker 2: No, that's my father's.
Speaker 1: What is grandfather's name then?
Speaker 2: The?--
Speaker 1: On your father's side?
Speaker 2: My grandfather's name on my father's side was T.E. Butler.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And you, you don't know what the T.E. stands for?
Speaker 2: I think it's Thomas.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Did your (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Wait--
Speaker 1: --mother--
Speaker 2: --his name was Alex, Alex Butler, I'm sorry.
Speaker 1: Alex?
Speaker 2: I'm getting 'em mixed up.
Speaker 1: Alex?
Speaker 2: A-L-E-X, Alex Butler was his name.
Speaker 1: A-L-E-X?  Alex Butler and he wa--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and he was married to Anne?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  It's Anne or Annie?
Speaker 2: Annie.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 632968
Speaker 1: Did your father [Thojest Butler, Sr.] share any stories about his growing up?
Speaker 2: Well yes, my father grew up in, in St. Helena Parish [Louisiana], he was, as a kid, he was always interested, of course, in agriculture, and I think that that his hero in life was Booker T. Washington in Tuskegee [Tuskegee Normal and Industrial Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama] and I think he played the French horn in college in Southern University's band.  And he went to Southern University [Southern University and Agricultural and Mechanical College, Baton Rouge, Louisiana] and majored in agriculture and he was in that, the class of 1932, and he was an ag agent in Washington Parish [Louisiana], and the sharing has to do, again with his emphasis was on the ownership of, of things.  For example, his life was not only his profession but we owned it, we owned a malt shop when I was growing up, we owned rental complexes, rental houses, twenty or thirty rental houses and very deep involved in the Methodist church.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, I look at him as a religious person who had a deep education of values, and they were builders.  So, I think that his family helped to build, his father [Alex Butler] helped to build the church where they were and they maintained the church.  So the religions variable was very, very important to my father and that whole generation as they were growing up.
Speaker 1: Tell me about per- your personal relationship with your father and times that you spent together.  What were some of the lessons learned from him?
Speaker 2: Well I think the lessons learned were, he was a--
Speaker 1: And I'm talking about as a small child.
Speaker 2: As a small child?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Well first of all, it was religious lessons, that is, I can remember him saying, "All right it's time to get up and go to Sunday school."  And another thing was the importance of study, we went to some baseball games together, I remember we went a baseball game in California.  But it was all about doing the right thing and realizing that you're responsible for yourself and that responsibility involved in knowing how to do something.  And the thing is, if you know how to take anything to the market in America, you'll be fine.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I was the third, I was the fourth in my family, there were three boys and I was the youngest boy.
Speaker 1: All right.  Who was the disciplinarian in your home?
Speaker 2: My mother [Johnnie Mae Sibley Butler].
Speaker 1: And, and, tell me any stories th-
Speaker 2: Oh, she would just get a switch and put it--
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: --put it, put us in the bathroom and beat the hell out of us, basically (laughter).
Speaker 1: Did (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Case closed.
Speaker 1: --did she share any stories about her growing up?
Speaker 2: Oh yes.  And of course, she's not in--ninety, ninety-three years old.  And she finished from Grambling High School [Grambling State University Laboratory High School, Grambling, Louisiana].  And she, and then she went to, I think she went to two years of Grambling [Louisiana Negro Normal and Industrial Institute; Grambling State University, Grambling, Louisiana] and then she finished from Southern University.  And she, she had a master's degree and she concentrated on rearing children and cooking and making sure that we did the right things.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, and it was more, it was my mother and my grandmother [Jessie Cahee Downs] together 'cause they were very, very close, she was an only child and so, and I still talk to her of course as much as I can.
Speaker 1: Is there a story about how your mother and father met?
Speaker 2: Yes.  My father was a principal in northern Louisiana--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --and he met her while he was a principal there, I think she was in school at Grambling, and they got married.
Speaker 1: Okay, so your father was a teacher and an insurance agent?
Speaker 2: My father, not a, my father was a county agent, C-O-U- agricultural county agent, he would have started out as a high school principal.
Speaker 1: Okay, did (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) In saint--in--out from Many, Louisiana.
Story_ID: 632969
Speaker 1: And so they [Butler's parents, Johnnie Mae Sibley Butler and Thojest Butler, Sr.] met and they married, do you know what year it was?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Tell me about your siblings.  Do you have siblings?
Speaker 2: Yes I do.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My oldest sister, went to Dillard University [New Orleans, Louisiana], finished from--
Speaker 1: What's her name, sorry.
Speaker 2: Beverly, B-E-V-E-R-L-Y.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Beverly Ann Butler, now Pool [Beverly Butler Pool], and she went off to college to Dillard University in New Orleans [Louisiana].
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And then she switched and finished from Southern University [Southern University and Agricultural and Mechanical College, Baton Rouge, Louisiana] and she married Daniel Pool who was in ROTC [Reserve Officers' Training Corps], so he was a service person and she kind of ended up in San Francisco [California] as a high school, north of San Francisco, was a, as a high school teacher.  And she went to San Francisco State [San Francisco State University, San Francisco, California] to pursue her Ph.D. and then her husband came down with multiple sclerosis and her husband then died of that disease and now she lives in Novato, California.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The next one is T.J. Butler, Jr., Thojest Jefferson Butler, Jr. [Thojest Butler, Jr.], and he's still in my hometown of Franklinton, Louisiana, which is just north of New Orleans and he was also in education area.  He was a high school principal, high school teacher on the school board.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Do, he does those kinds of things.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The third one we lost, his name was Terry Earl Butler.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He went to finish from Indiana University [Bloomington, Indiana] and then he went and got a Ph.D. from the Paris Conservatory of Music [Conservatoire de Paris, Paris, France], under Jean-Pierre Rampal, and then he got drowned in Morocco coming home at a beach party.
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: Then there's myself, and there's my youngest sister, her name is Jesslynn, J-E-S-S-L-Y-N-N, Sharmaine S-H-A-R-M-A-I-N-E, Butler [Jesslynn Butler] and she went to Dillard University and then went to Howard to med school [Howard University College of Medicine, Washington, D.C.], now she works for the CDC [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention], and she lives in Atlanta [Georgia], Jonesboro [Georgia].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's all of us.
Story_ID: 632970
Speaker 1: Thinking back to when you were a young man, a young boy, think of the sounds, the sights, and the smells of your home or neighborhood where you lived and tell me what comes to mind?
Speaker 2: Well I was reared in a very interesting enclave, what comes to mind is nice greenery, bayou looking place, everybody owned their own homes on my street, matter of fact, everybody finished college on my street.  And the food was absolutely wonderful and I could see people in my high school [Washington Parish High School, Franklinton, Louisiana] was right on the corner and I could see people walking up and down my street going to different kinds of activities.  I think that I had the best childhood of any person in America.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Um-hm.
Speaker 2: So I think of the good days of people telling you to dress well and do great things and the smell of gumbo and crawfish and neck bones, my [maternal] grandmother [Jessie Cahee Downs] liked to cook neck bones and mustard greens and it was a good thing, it was good times.
Speaker 1: What were some of the sounds that you hear in that area at that time?
Speaker 2: You hear crickets, you hear crickets and you might hear a car going up the street every now and then, somebody might have a muffler on their 1956 Chevrolet, flying down the street and so the sounds were good.
Speaker 1: You said you had a wonderful childhood, tell me about some of the things that happened during your childhood.
Speaker 2: Well you know, I, you know, I was, if you look at the southern population, of course, it was during the days of segregation--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And there was a bifurcation in segregation, on the one hand it was like an enclave, it was like living in a Chinatown, it was much like the immigrants develop, and in my situation, with a great elementary school and a great high school, and, and I'm raised in a town forty miles north of the city across Lake Pontchartrain, with a great emphasis on, again the importance of religion and the importance of, of education, and of course you played all the sports.  You had great role models, next door to me was my ag [agriculture] teacher in high school, the next, the next person was my high school principal, take a left behind his house was my high school coach, across the street was a cottage that, where teachers lived.  And I can think of going to Southern University [Southern University and Agricultural and Mechanical College, Baton Rouge, Louisiana] football games every Saturday, which was the best football in the country at that time, I would go to Southern University basketball games and we'd go down to Dillard University [New Orleans, Louisiana] to, Dillard had a football team then.  And so you think about all of the things that, that you essentially did and it was pretty interesting and it kind of gears toward, you know, people telling you to dress well and do great things because, you know, at that time, wherever you went you had to represent.  And of course, it was a life that, I call it the greatest generation had established since the slavery days and it was an emphasis on an enclave kind of phenomenon where people were expected to do good things.  And they were builders, I guess people built daycare centers, they built universities, people built high schools and they had private high schools, they had public high schools, so it was a generation that built things, they didn't ask people for much, but they built things.  And by the time I came of age, you had a cadre of black teachers that were doing great things in the Old South.
Story_ID: 632971
Speaker 1: Tell me about your elementary school, what was the name of the elementary school that you went to?
Speaker 2: Washington Parish Elementary School [Franklinton, Louisiana].
Speaker 1: And tell me about Washington Parish.
Speaker 2: It was a block from my house, there was probably thirty kids in my elementary, in my class, my mother [Johnnie Mae Sibley Butler] taught second grade so I'd always see my mother in elementary school.  I was always late because I didn't hear the bell from my house.  I can remember forty buses lining outside of the school, bringing people in from around the different parishes, from Lake Pontchartrain, to all the way from, to the northern part of the parish.  And the elementary school of course was connected to the--across the street from the high school [Washington Parish High School, Franklinton, Louisiana], but you had all of the programs there and you had people just learning, you know, the expectations were high, you had dress codes.
Speaker 1: What was the dress code?
Speaker 2: We had to dress well, I mean you had to have your shirttail in, you had to have khaki pants and, you know, those kinds of things.  It wasn't like going to a Catholic school, you know, where I'm from, there are lots of Catholic schools and I think that however that kind of bled off on the public schools.  Because if you were to go to a Catholic school, St. Mary's [St. Mary's Academy, New Orleans, Louisiana] or St. Augustine [St. Augustine High School] in New Orleans [Louisiana], you definitely had to have dress codes.  But I think that dress code kind of bled off on the expectations, and the other thing is that people were always teaching you how to essentially do well.
Speaker 1: Good.  Can you remember about the books that you had and whether you had a library (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, we had a library.
Speaker 1: At your school?
Speaker 2: A library at home, a library at school.
Speaker 1: Do you remember whether the books were knew books or whether they were, they came from another, maybe from the white schools (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I cannot remember--
Speaker 1: --and some others?
Speaker 2: --but I would think that, that would be the tradition.  If you look at research, two things happened, you would augment, that is--if the schools were, quote, underfunded, then you would augment, the parents would augment that and remember that know good schools were good in the South at that time, I mean when compared to the Northeast schools, the white schools were lacking.  So I think, that's why I think they had so many private, private black schools in the Old South, I mean there were academies in the Old South but I can't remember if the books were used or new.
Story_ID: 632972
Speaker 1: So we were talking about elementary school [Washington Parish Elementary School, Franklinton, Louisiana].  So, tell me some of the organizations that you've participated in, maybe the Boy Scouts [Boy Scouts of America] or (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh yeah, well you know--
Speaker 1: --things like that.
Speaker 2: --when I was, when I was growing up, Mr. Hollis [ph.] was our Boy Scout leader, and we, we went camping, and we did a lot of great things.  'Cause I was involved in church organizations as a kid.  I was the president of the MYF [Methodist Youth Fellowship] for example.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And, of course you had the basketball and you had the baseball and you were just, the grownups would organize you and you were just in essential place.  So, I can remember going to different places and playing different sports, I can remember playing Little League baseball and going to other towns, and competing and then of course seeing those kids grow up and mature.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: So, so you know, it was, we had a saying, you could never have too much sports or too much church and I think it was a--revolved around those kinds of activities.
Speaker 1: You also said that your [maternal] grandmother [Jessie Cahee Downs] liked to go fishing, did you go fishing with her?
Speaker 2: I went fishing many times, all the time.  We'd go to Cheniere Dam in Monroe, Louisiana and catch bass and bring 'em home and I would have to gut 'em and clean 'em, they would freeze 'em, and she also did, she made jelly out of apples and those kinds of things.  So, you learned to fish, 'cause you know, if you're from Louisiana, you've got to fish and so we learned to do those things and of course, when you did those kinds of things, you were excited and, because we would always pack a lunch, and we would eat out there as we were fishing and so it was just great.
Story_ID: 632973
Speaker 1: Who were some of the teachers in elementary school [Washington Parish Elementary School, Franklinton, Louisiana], maybe somebody that you admired or that inspired you in any way?
Speaker 2: Why certainly, I think that the--Barnes, Mrs. Barnes [ph.], was at my elementary school and she certainly inspired me and if I look back on, Coach Crain was an inspiration, Coach Johnson [Walter Lee Johnson] was an inspiration and of course my mother [Johnnie Mae Sibley Butler] was an inspiration but the person who really, really, really, really took care of me was a woman by the name of Eva McGhee, her married name was Eva Crain [ph.].
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And she took me around everywhere, around the parish [Washington Parish, Louisiana], and called me Little Johnny [HistoryMaker John S. Butler] and every time she went somewhere she dragged me along.  And so I think a lot about Eva and her family and her offspring because when I went to LSU [Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge, Louisiana], Eva said, "Don't go to LSU 'cause you will never finish."  But, certainly in elementary school these were the people that had great inspirational stories.
Story_ID: 632974
Speaker 1: And see, by the time I finished high school, the school had been there, you know, a hundred years and so it was a great place and people would come back from different parts of the world, so they would finish school and they would go to college and would go get a great job in Chicago [Illinois], a great job in Michigan.  And of course there was a place where, it was an interesting place, as a matter of fact, Julian [HistoryMaker Julian Bond], Julian Bond's father [Horace Mann Bond] was a dean at Dillard University [New Orleans, Louisiana]--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and there was a lynching around, it wasn't around a traditional lynching, it was around animals, they went after my hometown and he wrote a book and called it Star Creek, 'The Lynching at Star Creek' [sic. 'The Star Creek Papers,' Horace Mann Bond and Julia W. Bond] and someone just released that book about, about five years ago, and I got a letter from the author of that book who's an Englishman, I think.  But Julian Bond described my hometown of the 1900s, before my parents really got there, it was very, very interesting of how he talked about the hometown, the development of school, the relationship between the races because basically they're the same fa- a lot of the families are the same families, you really don't know where traditional white and blacks start and begin because we had lots of Creoles and lots of mulattoes in the black community.  But reading that book was, I knew all of their offspring, but I certainly did not know them because my family was not originally from there.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And he asked me to go back, and update the book because he was really interested because the school there, he said it was well financed more than other schools in the state and he was, he wrote a whole chapter on the relationship between the races that was so smooth in the 1890s and 1900s.
Speaker 2: So, can you remember as a child whether you were told about any racism, or did you experience anything that you can remember or did you just follow the routine of everyday?
Speaker 1: Well I think segregation was legal--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and basically there were two things that you were told.  First of all, you never got in trouble with the white population, but the white population was divided into two populations.  One was the white population who were merchants, and a lot of those merchants were Jewish merchants, and then, then there's the white population that the whites call white trash.  What segregation did was to keep you away from the white trash, but certainly you did not violate any of the rules, that is, I can barely remember the "For Colored Only" and the "Whites Only" kinds of signs but you certainly did not violate those rules.  The emphasis at that time was, oh you're doing well, and not, and not solving the issues of the white population 'cause much later our people would switch from you're doing well to how do you change and get people to like you.  But certainly where I grew up, I was, we were told that we were better than most people and education was the key.  And again, the heroes were Mary McLeod Bethune, Booker T. Washington, the people who were doing great things, mostly business people and educators, you know the people who were putting Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia] together, the people who were putting Spelman [Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia] together, the people who were putting Dillard together, those were the heroes, those were my heroes.  So we didn't really think much about the white population, but in a small town where I grew up, I mean, the white high school was, gosh, less than a mile from where I lived, and in terms of census strikes, there were whites who lived on the next, you know, on the next street.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Because a lot of the southern towns were like that.  But certainly segregation was a legal phenomenon, that is, there should be no mixing of the races in terms of the drinking of water fountain where you went to high school, where you went to elementary school and et cetera.
Speaker 2: So tell me, where did you go to--did you go from elementary school to high school, or was there a middle school?
Speaker 1: The middle school and elementary school were--
Speaker 2: Were together--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So, when you left there what high school did you go to?
Speaker 1: Washington Parish High School [Franklinton, Louisiana].
Speaker 2: Okay.  (Laughter) That's easy.  All right, now what year are we in when you go to high school?
Speaker 1: I finished high school in 1965, so this is nineteen--
Speaker 2: Nineteen (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) sixty [1960].
Speaker 2: --sixty [1960]?
Speaker 1: One [1961] or so.
Story_ID: 632975
Speaker 1: All right.  So while you're in high school [Washington Parish High School, Franklinton, Louisiana], civil rights is, begins to really start to heat up.  What are your remembrances of the early '60s [1960s] when the March on Washington happens and Kennedy [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy] is killed?
Speaker 2: Well, when Kennedy was killed I was on my--my brother [Terry Earl Butler] was in Indiana University [Bloomington, Louisiana] and I was on my way to, we were on our way to see the Indiana, Purdue [Purdue University, West Lafayette, Indiana] football game.  Well, I think that when the movement started as I can remember, and my parish was real active, Washington Parish [Louisiana] was active, Bogalusa [Louisiana] was active, we lost a good friend who was the sheriff in Varnado [Louisiana] in Washington Parish.  And, and also from my parish came the Deacons for Defense [Deacons for Defense and Justice], okay, so you had phenomenons going on.  The whole idea, and of course, in Baton Rouge [Louisiana], they had had bus boycotts way before the traditional kind of civil rights movement 'cause as a kid I can remember a kind of a, kind of two things, on the one hand, as the King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] tradition began, and of course this is when the ministers kicked in.  So I like to say that the ministers replaced the businesspeople for the erection of some black communities, so when I was growing up, it was the educators and the, and the scientists and the businesspeople who were important.  And I think that the first thing that you saw is that people organizing around the churches, what struck was that the organization, how organized it was, remember these were people who were well educated, these were the black teachers and et cetera.  But everybody didn't want something to do with the Civil Rights Movement as I remember, okay, 'cause also within the context of segregation, there was the protection of black enterprises that was protected, then over for a hundred years they had developed a school system that they considered that was, had done a good job, and were sending kids to college and doing good things.  In, I can remember when, was it Bartholomew [Joseph Bartholomew] who, when the first black country club was built in New Orleans [Louisiana] out on the, at SUNO [Southern University at New Orleans, New Orleans, Louisiana], if you wanted to play golf, and of course, there were all of these kind of structures there.  So, I can remember, and of course my class was the first black class of LSU [Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge, Louisiana], I mean, I was scheduled to go to another school and my father [Thojest Butler, Sr.] asked me to go to an undergraduate school at Louisiana State University, which I did, you know, for my father.  And so, I think that I can, it was just beginning to heat up on television and those kind of things and by the time I got to college in '64 [1964], you had James Meredith at Ole Miss [University of Mississippi, Oxford, Mississippi], so I was a junior in high school.  So by the time I got to college, you were in the full forces of, of the Civil Rights Movement, by '68 [1968], all the northern cities were burning, where they might have had more of an impact by the way.  The NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] was of course, was the legal organization, King was associated with the Southern Christian Leadership movement [Southern Christian Leadership Conference] that was different from the NAACP.  And so I think that the thing about the Civil Rights Movement is how organized it was, of course, King had gone to Morehouse College [Atlanta, Georgia], one of the most prestigious colleges in the South, they were all fraternity people or sorority people.  We had, it was great leadership, I think, what happened is that, what I remember, is I remember the news, I can remember I was a junior in college when King was shot, I think that was '68 [1968].
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: I was a junior at LSU when King was shot, and Michael Dick came and told me that, that King had been, had been killed.  So, I think that what I remember is, then the reaction and then the development of the Deacons for Defense in Bogalusa, Louisiana where they began to say, okay, you know, you know, there'll be no more of the turn the other cheek, and then developed the Deacons for Defense and then there's Carmichael [Stokely Carmichael; Kwame Ture] and Hamilton's [Charles V. Hamilton] black power and to politics and liberation.  So about, about 1960, I don't know, '6 [1966] or '67 [1967], I think that the Civil Rights Movement was replaced by, you know, the Black Power movement, the pride movement, the development of Afro, and that was another phenomenon.  So I kind of, I could live through that so I went from the--I can remember the, you know, conversations about, about the King movement and supporting the King movement because, because many people in Atlanta [Georgia] were also from, they're basically the same families, you know, some from Louisiana and Atlanta.  So, I can remember that, I can remember stories, I can remember King being on 'Johnny Carson' ['The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson'], everybody sitting around the TV listening to his philosophy and so it was, I found it very, very interesting.  And of course, it was based on religion.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: It was all based on, it was, it was a switch because the switch was from how people should treat you, and we had always been taught that you never worry about what people think about you, you get yourself together educationally.  And that's the way you operated.
Story_ID: 632976
Speaker 1: So, you started telling me a story about you were on your way somewhere, when Kennedy [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy] was killed?
Speaker 2: Well yes.  I was on my way to--my parents [Johnnie Mae Sibley Butler] and I, my brother [Terry Earl Butler] was going to Indiana University [Bloomington, Indiana]--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --he played in the band in Indiana University, we were going to the Indiana University, Purdue [Purdue University, West Lafayette, Indiana] football game and he lived in the Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity house, with Booker T. and the MGs, and we were going up there to see him and spend a weekend with him and when we got there, they cancelled the football game and everybody sat around the television and watched all of the horrible kinds of events that, that evolved after the assassination of President Kennedy.  But I can remember that I was maybe, tenth grade, ninth grade, ninth or tenth grade [at Washington Parish High School, Franklinton, Louisiana], that was 1963.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And so, that's kind of where I was when Kennedy was assassinated.
Speaker 1: Assassinated, okay.
Story_ID: 632977
Speaker 1: Tell me more about your high school days, some of the other things that you might have began to do in high school [Washington Parish High School, Franklinton, Louisiana].  You're very musical, so tell me when did music come into your life?  When did you start (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I'm very mus--
Speaker 1: --playing?
Speaker 2: --well, you know my mother [Johnnie Mae Sibley Butler] plays piano.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My [maternal] grandfather [John Sibley] plays, my sister [Beverly Butler Pool] started majoring in music and we all played instruments.  My brother played trumpet in Southern University's [Southern University; Southern University and Agricultural and Mechanical College, Baton Rouge, Louisiana] band, had another brother who was a drum major in Southern University's band, my brother [Terry Earl Butler] played, when he transferred from Southern, he went to Indiana [Indiana University, Bloomington, Indiana] he played in IU's band, I played in LSU's [Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge, Louisiana] band.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: I played guitar, I played piano and I sing.  If you're from southern Louisiana, you can't get a date unless you know how to play an instrument.  So, if you go to, if you've ever been to New Orleans [Louisiana] and music was, sort of the life.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Everybody had a band, kids in my high school had a band called (unclear), The Astronauts, and so I, I took to the guitar, I always liked the guitar.  We found our, my brother and I went to Western Auto [ph.] and bought our first guitar and I started playing the guitar.  So, my music evolves from my family, we would sit around the piano and play, play songs, remember that there was television but there was no Internet and so, and the games that we played had to do with musical games.  And of course I also sang in the church choir, my mother was director of music for the, for Winan United Methodist Church in Franklinton, Louisiana and so music has always been a way for me to really, really enjoy myself.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so in high school I played trombone in the band, I played on a great basketball team, I walked on at LSU to break the, to help break the color line in the SEC [Southeastern Conference] and so in high school basically it was study, basketball, and music.  I was in the honors society, the National Honor Society in high school, and I was president of Methodist Youth Fellowship, for the State of Louisiana, went all over the country.
Speaker 1: What was that?
Speaker 2: Methodist Youth Fellowship, MYF.  I was on the national council of the Methodist Youth Fellowship and we went to Purdue [Purdue University, West Lafayette, Indiana] and Emory [Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia] and Berkeley [University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, California] for different kinds of programs, so I, I enjoyed my high school days.
Speaker 1: Now (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Great stories.  Of course you get introduced to girls during--
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: --during high school.
Story_ID: 632978
Speaker 1: Now tell me the story about how you decided once again to go to LSU [Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge, Louisiana]?
Speaker 2: Well I was either going to go to Indiana [Indiana University, Bloomington, Indiana], Michigan [University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan] or--Southern [Southern University; Southern University and Agricultural and Mechanical College, Baton Rouge, Louisiana] was my family, and my mother [Johnnie Mae Sibley Butler] had gone to Southern, my father [Thojest Butler, Sr.] had gone to Southern, I knew J.S. Clark [Joseph Samuel Clark] so, and I spent so much time on Southern campus, I was really looking at Indiana, and Brandy Bauker [ph.], asked me to go to Louisiana State University to be in their first black undergraduate class to go there.  And so I caucused with everybody and said, why not, so, it was only about an hour and a half from my house and so I went to LSU and with the understanding that I can transfer anywhere and I stayed there and basically I enjoyed the school, fell in love with the school, I played in the band for four years, I did the, I walked on the basketball team to kind of break the color line at seventeen.  Seven years later, another great family member, Collis Temple, would be the first black scholarship athlete at LSU in basketball.
Speaker 1: So you were the first black on the baseball team?
Speaker 2: Basketball.
Speaker 1: Basketball team.
Speaker 2: Well it was, actually it was the walk on, you know, it was against the law for blacks to play in the SEC [Southeastern Conference], believe it or not, now we've got to tell the coach to go recruit a white player now.  But in those days, the SEC was mostly, was all-white, and that's one of the biggest surprises, as I look back that, that Alabama [University of Alabama, Tuscaloosa, Alabama], and Tennessee [University of Tennessee, Knoxville, Tennessee] where your son played and Georgia [University of Georgia, Athens, Georgia] and LSU and Florida [University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida] would start eleven black players, that's the biggest, when I look back because it was, going there and desegregating the, the southern schools was about academics, it was never about sports because it had a tremendous impact on the black colleges [HBCUs].  So, when I was growing up, I can tell you this, then the, the best football team in America was probably Prairie View [Prairie View Agricultural & Mechanical College of Texas; Prairie View A&M University, Prairie View, Texas] in the '60s [1960s], and I think they've have won a national championship if they had played in the old Southwestern Athletic Conference.  I think that Southern University would have won the SEC almost every year, so, I think that the unattended consequence was that the great football powers of the traditional white schools, I mean Prairie View, Southern University, Alabama or any of us, the kids had a different choice and there's no greater stage, if you're going to play football in Georgia, then to go to the University of Georgia.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Good.
Speaker 2: It's a great stage.
Speaker 1: So, academically how did you do there at LSU?
Speaker 2: I did pretty good, I wa- I did good enough to go to a graduate school at Northwestern [Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois] (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: Yeah.  It was, you know, academically it was, I could have done better, but you know the, I guess there were three of us when I first got there and the professor would always say, well you know, I had one professor say, "Well the federal government put you here and we don't want you here, but I'm not gonna do anything against you academically."  And so, I think that that was the deal that you could ask for, and of course, I think it became better as people became, by the time I graduated in '69 [1969], I think that there were probably, we had gone from three on campus to a good number of black kids going to LSU.  But you know, when we, when we went there, I mean it was, it wasn't like we were the first generation to go to college.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So Wanda Sanders [ph.] was there, her father was a professor at Grambling [Grambling College; Grambling State University, Grambling, Louisiana], Brenda Temple [Brenda Temple Tull] was there, her father had gone to Michigan State [Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan] and was with my father at Southern, he was also an inspiration to me.  As a matter of fact, his grandson Garrett Temple now plays on the LSU basketball team.  So, and our parents paid our way to go to school, so it wasn't like we were there, I would say, if I were to say anything, we thought we were better than most people, you know, who were there.  We came from great families with a great emphasis on education.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Yeah so, so it was pretty interesting.
Story_ID: 632979
Speaker 1: You graduate in 1969, had you decided what you were then going to do after--
Speaker 2: Well, I wanted to go (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) school [Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge, Louisiana]?
Speaker 2: --to graduate school but I got drafted, you know I'm a Vietnam [Vietnam War] veteran.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, tell--
Speaker 2: --I got drafted--
Speaker 1: --me about that.  Tell me about the draft.
Speaker 2: --well I got drafted and I went to basic training and I was a medic in Vietnam.
Speaker 1: Where did you go to basic training?
Speaker 2: Fort Polk, Louisiana.
Speaker 1: And how was that for you?
Speaker 2: Well you know, it was like the Boy Scouts [Boy Scouts of America], an upscale version of the Boy Scouts, you know we did, we did the cadence, and it was, it was different and you got to realize at the time, I think every, probably every male teacher that I had had, had gone to the service.  It wasn't until later that people would have protests against our [U.S.] military service.  So, it was a thing about every generation had its war and of course, I was in the class, I guess that first class that was drafted when they got rid of the, what, you know, they got rid of deferments.  And so it was pretty interesting, I had a lot of friends who got drafted with me so, we went up to basic training and it was typical basic training it was pretty tough and it wasn't like it is today.  And, but it was interesting because I ended up studying military organizations in, you know as a professor but, you know then I went to San Antonio [Texas] for my medic training and then I was off to Vietnam in the 27th Surgical Hospital [Chu Lai, Vietnam] pulling people off of helicopters and trying to get soldiers back home.
Speaker 1: So what years were you in the service?
Speaker 2: Nineteen sixty-nine [1969], '70 [1970], it was a two year commitment right?
Speaker 1: Um-hm, all right.
Speaker 2: And then I left Fort Hood [Texas], drove to Northwestern [Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois] and went to grad school (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Any stories to share about Vietnam?
Speaker 2: You know, I don't talk much about Vietnam, I think that, I think that all wars are bad and I think that the experience is the same for probably all soldiers, I think that we share a certain kind of fraternity, I think that when I talk to World War II [WWII] veterans, what's interesting about them is that they didn't know when they were coming home, you know?  With Vietnam you knew that if you went on January 1st, you came back the next year, January 1st and I think that it was, the thing about war is that you bond with the soldiers themselves, and the interesting thing is, how do you get back home?  And so Vietnam to me was, as a medic was pretty hairy in terms of things and so, so we would have a Huey [Bell UH-1 Iroquois] to come in, and it's full of bodies, and you pull 'em off and determine who would live and who would die and try to get 'em into the surgical hospital as fast as you can.  And you try to stay alive, there was lots of rockets thrown at you and those kinds of things.  But you, you saw it as a, you did it as a young person and you did it with people your own age and so it was.  As a matter of fact when I went back to the Vietnam Memorial [Vietnam Veterans Memorial] in Washington [D.C.], I didn't know how powerful it was 'cause it's just a V in the ground but, they had to take me out of there, it was like going to church.  I think that the lesson for me from Vietnam is that this little stuff worries me, you know?  I don't, I don't worry about a lot of things.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so, it was pretty interesting.
Story_ID: 632980
Speaker 1: So you go off to Northwestern [Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Go off to Northwestern University.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  Tell me what happens?
Speaker 2: Well you know, I go to graduate school and I go study with Charles Moskos, who's the foremost organizational person in the world on military organization.  Morris Janowitz in Chicago [University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois], a military organization, Howard Becker [Howard S. Becker] is there, and I studied with great people and I always had an interest in organizations whether they're a business organizations or all types of organizations.  I settled on studying military organizations because at first, because it was the only play where you could get race effects, because in the military there are always lots of black populations, so you could study job satisfaction, you could study organization commitment, you could study promotions, you have, you had enough of the black population to put in samples to do the statistics analysis.  So, I came under the influence of Northwestern University and a great school and also had an interested in my, I was interested in and always studying black entrepreneurship and the immigrant entrepreneurs, my major professor, Charles Moskos was a Greek, we would go to Greektown [Chicago, Illinois] to eat and I was fascinated about, you know, the number of enterprises and from a sociological point of view and the business point, it was always interesting to see how somebody could land in America one month, and the next six months have a business going.  You know, of course, the immigrants continued to do that today and so in my career, I've written on blacks in the [U.S.] military, immigrant entrepreneurship, wealth creation among black Americans.  So, I went to Northwestern University and met my wife from Cleveland, Ohio, and--
Speaker 1: What was her name?
Speaker 2: Rosemary Griffey [Rosemary Griffey Butler], G-R-I--G-R-I-F-F-E-Y, that was her maiden name.
Speaker 1: And when did y'all marry?  What year did you get married?
Speaker 2: Nineteen seventy-two [1972].  (Laughter) I think (simultaneous).
Story_ID: 632981
Speaker 1: We were beginning to, or we need to talk, go back a little bit and talk about how you came to decide about organization, and tell me more about what it is that you do?
Speaker 2: Well you know, if you, if you go back and look at what my father [Thojest Butler, Sr.] did, my father was interested in agriculture, that is, what plants did, what made plants grow?  And as a county agent working with experiments, they would say, "Well we're gonna create a cucumber that is big as this house and we're gonna take it to the fair," or the farmer would say, "I'm having trouble with the soil," and he would say, "Well, to explain this, what you got to do is to rotate the soil, okay?  Or add this to the soil."  I was always interested in human behavior, what made people do what they do, and I was drawn to sociology because my early readings was like social physics, physicists and sociologists modeled the world in the same way, that is, create the model that will explain why things happen.  So, for example, we've never seen gravity, but Newton [Isaac Newton] created an entire science around the impact of gravity, well the earliest scholars in, in sociology, people like, Emile Durkheim and Auguste Comte, would say, well you know, you, you could never see a norm or value, but it has a force on the individual just like gravity, so therefore social physics, as it was originally called, was the science of trying to understand exactly why people do certain things and within the context of that mix I was not interested in plants, I was not interested in going to med school, I was not interested in biology, or chemistry, I was interested in why people do certain things.  And psychology doesn't do it for me because nobody does things based on their psychological makeup unless of course they've lost touch with reality, their norms and their values and their expectations, just like there's gravity, the gravitational pull, so I like to model the world from an organizational point of view, essentially argue that, for example, if you become a part of military organizations, then there are certain values and norms and expectations that you must do, it's not that you want to go to war, but the expectations are there.  If you become a minister, right?  It's not that you want to go to church every Sunday, but the expectation's there.  So I chose organizational science because it is, I think the best way to try to explain human behavior and in the context of human behavior there's organizations, and within the context of organizations, why do people do what they do?  And so we studied why people stay in organizations.  Why they leave org- why, why do they leave organizations?  Why do people create business enterprises?  So that me starting a daycare center or starting a religious institution is just like starting an idea with computers, it's all about creating an effective organization, when people understand the expectations and the values in what you want to do.  So there's no better science and everything evolves from that, communications comes out of that, film comes out of that, management is applied, psychology and sociology.  Everything but accounting, accounting has its own discipline.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That's a good explanation so that you know, you can understand what it is that you do.  I mean it was, it makes a lot of sense to me now, okay.  Seventy-one [1971], you're at Northwestern [Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois], a fellow for social change, is that right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And then in '72 [1972], you have another fellow, the Center for Urban Affairs [Institute for Policy Research]?
Speaker 2: Right (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) A graduate student--
Speaker 2: --these are as a graduate student.
Speaker 1: A graduate student.
Speaker 2: I was a graduate student, and these were fellowships that allowed me to pay the high rent in Evanston, Illinois.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Okay.  Now when did you pledge?  Did you, you pledged what?
Speaker 2: Kappa Alpha Psi [Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity].
Speaker 1: And when did you pledge?
Speaker 2: Well I actually started, there was, there was a person from Southern University [Southern University and Agricultural and Mechanical College, Baton Rouge, Louisiana] who came down to LSU [Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge, Louisiana] and my brother, Willie Kaplan [ph.], and he came and said he had pledged at the Alpha chapter at, in Indiana [Indiana University, Bloomington, Indiana], and he had told this person that I got a younger brother at LSU there's no chapter, what are we gonna do?  So, he came down to campus and he said, "You know you got to pledge Kappa Alpha Psi while you're in college."  I said, "There's no Kappa chapter," whatever--the Alpha, Alpha Sigma chapter at Southern University.  So we tried to set up a colony at that time.  By the way, the Kappa chapter at LSU was developed, I don't know, fifteen years later.  And so, we were working on the Alpha, on the, on Alpha Sigma, and so he was a registrar at Southern University, and so he started there and he started all the paperwork and we couldn't quite get it, get it together, so I interacted some with the alumni chapter there, and where would I--Mr. Chapman [ph.].  So when I got back from Vietnam, all of the paperwork was there, so I finished up at the, at the Evanston, Illinois alumni chapter, so they brought all my paperwork and just completed the process, completed the process there.
Speaker 1: Oh (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It had just--
Speaker 1: --okay.
Speaker 2: --you know, now my nephews are, my nephew's a Kappa and--but my son [John Butler] didn't pledge, he went to Texas [University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas], but I thought it was pretty interesting.  But, I think that the black Greek organizations are, have always done great things, although we had some, some challenges with the hip hop culture in Greek organizations.  But I think that for the most part, it has--over the years it was done for services and to better one's self with the emphasis on achievement and doing great things.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And of course, to be a Kappa you got to be kind of good looking--
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: --not like the other ones (laughter).
Story_ID: 632982
Speaker 1: So, you graduate in 1974 [from Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And, is there any stories about you being a visiting research fellow in McLean, Virginia?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I was--that was really my first job.  I went to Washington, D.C., there were doing their first study of military organizations and race, and I was supposed to go to Europe and do my dissertation, but I was hired as a research assistant and we did all the original questionnaires on race relations in the [U.S.] military, hadn't been done since Stouffer's book 'The American Soldier' [Samuel A. Stouffer].  It was a time when the American military was experiencing, coming out of Vietnam [Vietnam War], there was a lot of racial polarization within military organization as there was in the civilian sector.  So the question was, what's going on, and so we did questionnaires, we did it all over the world, and I was a part of collecting the data and helping to analyze the data.  It was a great exercise in sampling, and a great exercise in statistical analysis and also provided me data, they provided me data for me to start my career in publishing as a professor.  So a lot of my early articles are on race and the military organizations, academic articles, and then much later I would do a book with Charles Moskos ['All That We Can Be: Black Leadership and Racial Integration the Army Way,' Charles Moskos and John Sibley Butler].
Story_ID: 632983
Speaker 1: Let's talk about that book at this point.
Speaker 2: 'All That We Can Be' ['All That We Can Be: Black Leadership and Racial Integration the Army Way,' Charles Moskos and John Sibley Butler] book.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Well, Charles Moskos was my major professor.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And we did that book in 1997, and I finished in 1974, so how many years later?  So basically, we got the idea because Moskos had also had done early stuff on race in the [U.S.] military and when you look at organizations, it was obvious that the military had done all of this stuff much sooner than, than civilian organizations.  For example, Truman [President Harry S. Truman] desegregated the military in 1948, that's way before 1954 and all deliberate speed.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: So actually you could, you could go to a military base in Georgia, and on the military base it's completely integrated and the civilian sector is completely segregated, and so we asked the kind of question that you ask, you know, a book was asking like, in search of excellence, and asks what are the lessons that you can learn from the military because from a historical point of view, an opportunity, that is, we were not concerned about who liked who and, as they are today.  We taught, we're concerned about a paycheck, so we put together a book entitled, 'All That We Can Be,' actually it was written for Harvard Press [Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts] and then they said it was, the lessons were too great to go to an academic press, so we put it with a regular press out of New York [New York], in a big, you know, a big networking and launch and basically looked at what the military had done historically to provide opportunities for black Americans.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: So it was all about opportunities.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so we looked at the impact of training and of course what came out of the book is that of course, the relationship with training and what you do.  That is, if you, if you're doing a job in the military, you basically know how to do, and of course the military, the list in rank can get up to 40 percent, 40 percent black, the officers corps came mostly from historically black colleges [HBCUs], so that took us back to what they were doing right, the NCO Corps was, was very, very interesting, perhaps the most interesting thing in the book to me was how the NCO Corps educated their kids, which is very similar to me, to the old black southern bourgeoisie that developed black colleges.  So we went around to colleges and universities and we found that kids who finished from military services, excuse me, kids of sergeants in the military were just blowing through American colleges and universities, I mean Tiger Woods' father [Earl Woods] was in the military, Shaquille O'Neal's father [sic. stepfather, Phillip A. Harrison] was in the military, so it goes on and on and on.  So it led us to argue that the military culture also produced college educated kids, but the book was about the excellence of military organizations and providing opportunities for people, it provided the first scholarship, ROTC [Reserve Officers' Training Corps] scholarship and so it was interesting but the book got a whole of press by the way (laughter).
Speaker 1: It did.  When the term Afro-Anglo culture--
Speaker 2: Yes--
Speaker 1: --was used in, tell me about that.
Speaker 2: Well I believe that American society is Afro-Anglo, that is, it's Anglo because it's the, it's English institutions, it's English language, it's the English way of doing things, it is not a multicultural society, it's basically Afro England, I mean, Afro, it's Afro in the sense that, I think that, if you look at the mili- if you look at military service, if you look at the white population, there are many elements of the black culture that white population share, whether it's music, whether it's film, or just thinking about the world.  So, we argue that the American society basically, the Europeans migrated to the English culture and we know that there's German culture in America, but don't stick out, all right?  We don't think that the Spanish culture sticks out like the African culture does, and if you look at the military service where it was, the country started out as black and English and so it was black Americans and the English who defeated the British.  The Buffalo Soldiers had a great thing to say about the covered wagons crossing the plains and they fought the Indians [Native American] and won tooth and nail.  So, at the end of the day, we argued that the black culture, in American black culture, has influenced white culture, so we call it an Afro-Anglo culture.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You like that?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: That didn't catch on too much though.
Story_ID: 632984
Speaker 1: When you finish the research there as a research assistant there, we're into 1975--
Speaker 2: And I got to University of Texas [University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas] in 1974.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: As a professor.
Speaker 1: As a professor in 1974 (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --University of Texas.
Speaker 2: I, I--
Speaker 1: Okay--
Speaker 2: --chose to come to, to UT Austin.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, okay now, in 1975, the presidential think tank on an all-volunteer military?
Speaker 2: Yes--
Speaker 1: Tell me about that--
Speaker 2: --this was the, well we switched from the all-volunteer force, we switched from the draft to the all-volunteer force.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: President Carter [President James Earl "Jimmy" Carter, Jr.] had think tanks, and we went out to, to the Air Force Academy [United States Air Force Academy, Colorado].  I'll never forget it because I, I roomed with Reuven Gal, who at that time was the chief psychologist of the Israeli military, and we compared from an intellectual point of view, we compared different militaries around the globe.  And the question was, could the American military have an all-volunteer force, could we do what we needed to do based, not on the draft, but on an all-volunteer force?  Of course, the draft got in a lot of heat, especially when all of the anti-war movements had developed around Vietnam [Vietnam War], that was done mostly on the, on white campus and my white middle kids, white middle class kids refused to go in the service.  They were burning ROTC [Reserve Officers' Training Corps] buildings, ROTC buildings were moving from white campuses to black campuses, so it was during that time period.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And so, out of that book, Charles Moskos and Wood [Frank R. Wood] did a book called, 'The Military, Just Another Job?' [sic. 'The Military: More Than Just a Job?,' ed. Charles C. Moskos and Frank R. Wood], and have a chapter in there about how the changing organizational structure of the military would affect race relations.  So you would have now, the separation of workplace and residence, whereas before, everybody was on the base.  You would have the development of marketplace standards, whereas before, you served in the military for duty and country and you were an institutional format.  So, it was like the priesthood, everything was paid for, but now it's more in the marketplace thing, so that was an interesting kind of thing I did as a young man.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So tell me, what happens next?
Speaker 2: Oh well, what happens next is I settle into the tradition of an academic, that is, being a professor in a major university means lots of publications, lots of writings, publications and great journalist, you forget about writing books, you publish in, in organizational journals such as the American Sociological Review, the Journal of Political and Military Sociology, so it's all about being a scholar, that is, if you're going to maintain that tradition, then you've got to, you've got to publish.  So I was in the publication mode, so I did work on military organizations, I started work on black entrepreneurship, I did work on organizational commitment, why people stay in organizations, why they leave organizations. I did work on why people are promoted in organizations.  And so, I settled into a, in a vernacular of the university to get tenure and to show that I could be a tenured professor at a major research university.  So, from about 1974 to, I don't know, 19--to six years later, that was my life, it was all about writing publications, writing publications, writing in publications.
Speaker 1: So, when do you, you, let me see, create the National Journal of Sociology?
Speaker 2: The National Journal of Sociology was created in the 1980s as, as a way to--it was really related to desktop publishing and it was done to extend the knowledge base of what people were publishing and the journal was around all disciplines, we had some great scholars to publish there, I was the founder of the journal.  And it was about,  basically the number of journals were, were beginning to increase at the time and we decided here at the University of Texas that we would do a journal called, the National Journal of Sociology, and to publish work and so it turned out to be a good thing.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I think it was in print for maybe, we did it for maybe fifteen years?
Story_ID: 632985
Speaker 1: And I see you are in many think tanks--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: --testing on American organizations, and this is at California (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Berkeley.
Speaker 1: Berkeley [University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, California].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And what was that about?
Speaker 2: Right, you know, the question was the place of test scores, how do we predict test scores.  And of course the [U.S.] military had done the early work on test scores and performance, and I guess coming out of, the biggest thing coming out of the--the biggest thing coming out of Stouffer's [Samuel A. Stouffer] study was that northern blacks scored higher than southern whites on the military batteries when they were first done.  And I think that, and the question was, how do you know I'm testing?  Because you know, testing in advanced societies, you got to have a way to, to weed people out, if you will.  So we went out to the University of California, Berkeley, and spent some time out there and we did a book that came out of there and I have a chapter in there.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And what it does is kind of look at the impact, the academic impact of testing, and of course, with me studying entrepreneurs, it probably doesn't have any impact on entrepreneurship.  But certainly going within an organization that--in who goes to school to who hires you.  And of course the--I mean it's still out on testing because when I study entrepreneurs, I mean, we have a kid here, Michael Dell, who dropped out of school and did well.  We have another guy from Austin [University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas], John Mackey who, who finished school, he did Whole Foods [Whole Foods Market, Inc.] and he's done well.  So, the entrepreneurship stuff and the creativity is different when it comes to testing.  We have kids who can win the oboe recital, right?  As we say, and Einstein [Albert Einstein] couldn't write his name.  So that was the whole emphasis on test scores and the impact of test scores and what test scores, it does, and how people get into organizations, and there was a whole research agenda associated with test scores.
Story_ID: 632986
Speaker 1: Tell me about the different organizations that you belong to.  Were you ever a member of say, the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] or any other organizations that were affiliated just with African Americans?
Speaker 2: Well I guess I'm a paying member of the NAACP now, I'm not sure what their mission is today, but certainly I'm a paying member.  I'm a member of, gosh, the National Center for Neighborhood Enterprise [Woodson Center, Washington, D.C.], Bob Woodson's [HistoryMaker Robert Woodson] shop, that does, we studied the, how neighborhoods can revitalize themselves and how neighborhoods themselves, how people can take sort of control of their life through entrepreneurship, Bob Woodson has done a good job, we had a thing on '60 Minutes' where we had people who would take over neighborhoods and put the entrepreneurial spirit there and really, really change, you know, the neighborhood kind, kind of components.  And so, anything having to do with black entrepreneurship, I was always involved in that.  I'm a board member of OFC, Opportunity Funding Corporation, which Jesse Hill, your Atlanta [Georgia] guy is the--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --he's a major part, and we, we sponsor things like business plan competitions in historically black schools [HBCUs], and we've really gotten really into the education component of that.  I sit on the board of the Morehouse Research Institute that enhances the abilities of Morehouse College [Atlanta, Georgia] to get research money, you know, and do the, and do those kinds of things.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: So, I can go on and on, I guess (laughter).
Speaker 1: Well you received the Eyes of Texas award, which is an award given by the students is (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes--
Speaker 1: --that right?
Speaker 2: --the Eyes of Texas award is an award given to faculty members for involvement in student affairs, I helped to charge, to start the Kappa Alpha Psi [Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity] chapter here at the University of Texas [University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas], I was always involved in student activities here, faculty advisor, University of Texas, athletic counselor, University of Texas, so that award sort of goes around campus and ask, hey which professors speak to us and do great things (laughter)--
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: --so I was chosen there to do that and that was interesting.
Speaker 1: Now what's interesting is that you would become the president of LSU's [Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge, Louisiana] alumni association, is that right?
Speaker 2: Yes, I was the president of the LSU alumni association for central Texas, and now sit on the board of that organization.
Speaker 1: Thank you, and just imagine that you were in that first class (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I was in that first class--
Speaker 1: --with three (laughter), with three blacks--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: --at that time.
Speaker 2: Yeah with, yes with three blacks at that time, and you know?  And, like my [maternal] grandmother [Jessie Cahee Downs], I love my alma mater, I give a lot to my alma mater, and I'm just doing a scholarship in my father's [Thojest Butler, Sr.] name, I just finished a fifty thousand dollar commitment to my alma mater, now I sit on the board of directors now, we raised professorships at the colleges, we've raised top one hundred scholarships at the college and, and it's a different school than when I was there and it's all about opportunities.  So, you know, I get that from my parents and my grandparents, that is, you always give back to your school, and I happened to have gone to a, not a historical black college but to a previously segregated school the Old South.  And so--
Speaker 1: But it was all about opportunity--
Speaker 2: It was all about (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) but you studied--
Speaker 2: --opportunities.  It was all about opportunities, and so that's why I went to school and that's why where I'm gonna leave a lot of money and that's where I'm gonna give a lot of money because that's how, that's where I went to school, it's about education, they do lots of good things there and it's a, that's why I went to school and so it's had a great impact on my life and I wanted to have an impact on other people's lives.
Speaker 1: All right.  All right, so now we're in about 1989, tell me about IUS [Inter-University Seminar on Armed Forces and Society]?
Speaker 2: IUS is a military organization.  It's like a, the academy of management, the university seminar on the armed forces--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --and a great professor by the name of Morris Janowitz from the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois] started it, and basically IUS, we have a national meeting every year, we have a journal called, Armed Forces and Society, and these are scholars who study military organizations, so we publish in that journal and I was associated with that, I am a member of that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, because I studied military organizations.
Story_ID: 632987
Speaker 1: What happens next in your life as far as--we're talking about, we're going into the 1990s now.
Speaker 2: Well I'm rearing a son [John Butler] who's my namesake, and he's finishing high school in 1995, and he attends the University of Texas [University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas] and finishing, finished this year, and became the fifth generation college graduate in the family, which we are very proud of.  And of course I'm getting more involved into chairing things, I'm chair of the sociology department, I chair the management department and I was interim director of African American studies so, I'm getting to be an old head at the university so they're pulling on me to do administrative work.  And my research is, I published a book called 'Entrepreneurship and Self-Help among Black Americans' [John S. Butler], which is a history of the greatest generation, of how people came out of slavery, within one hundred years, they created business enterprises, over one hundred private colleges and universities.  And how that sort or parallels the emphasis on civil rights and how the Civil Rights Movement came out of that.  And so, I'm still publishing, I'm still writing, but I'm getting more involved with this administrative stuff, and now I'm director of IC^2 Institute [Innovation, Creativity and Capital Institute] at the University of Texas where we do lots of, create companies, we have an incubator, we do a lot of research on wealth creation.
Speaker 1: We probably need to explore that a little bit more.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: IC^2 Institute, tell me more about that.
Speaker 2: It's an institute for innovation and creativity and it was, you know the universities are designed to, to have departments and institutes and basically we collect faculty around the, the campus and study market economies and how can market economies improve and the founder of that is George Kozmetsky, who is the former dean of the business school, Michael Dell came through his tutelage when he was at IC^2.  We've built over a hundred companies, we had six companies to go public, we've created a lot of wealth, so as the component of the university engages in technology transfer, and our laboratory is not a chemistry laboratory but rather it is, like the medical students, we have a laboratory where we learn to start companies.  And so what I have to manage is the IC^2 Institute and the incubator, we have a commercialization area and we get grants and instead of it being in a biology lab it's, it's a lab about wealth creation and it's kind of similar to what, similar to what Booker T. Washington did with Tuskegee [Tuskegee Normal and Industrial Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama] at the turn of the century when he had George Washington Carver creating the peanut and industries all around the peanut.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: So right now we're looking at, we have an incubator, we do clean energy, we do traditional IT [information technology], so we're doing all of the, trying to stay ahead of, here in Texas those things that would allow jobs and opportunities.  Texas is a state that creates wealth, and you know that Southwest Airlines [Southwest Airlines Co.] came out of here, Dell [Dell Inc.] computers came out of here, Whole Foods [Whole Foods Market, Inc.] came out of here, National Instruments [National Instruments Corporation] came out of here, Golfsmith [Golfsmith International Holdings, Inc.] came out of here, (unclear), it just goes on and on and on.  So, the thing about this state is that the University of Texas is committed to staying ahead of the industry and IC^2 is a part of that.
Story_ID: 632988
Speaker 1: Okay, so let's talk more about entrepreneurship.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Tell me more about your involvement.
Speaker 2: Well you know, as a black southerner growing up, when we would go to Dooky Chase's [Dooky Chase's Restaurant] in New Orleans [Louisiana], we'd go to Mary's [ph.] in Baton Rouge [Louisiana], and then you, you look at people who were sending their kids to college, and it was the kind of enterprises that were, are the lifestyle enterprises that is, for example, I consider owning your own farm an entrepreneur, you know, because you are, you're working the land and you're bringing a crop and putting the crop to market.  I have a saying I always tell my clients, nobody ever came to America to vote, and I think that the--and I do that for the jolt if you will, for the importance of entrepreneurship.  So I was always fascinated by people owning things, when I was in high school [Washington Parish High School, Franklinton, Louisiana] taking civics or when I was in high school taking mathematics, I really wanted to learn about how they started Sears and Roebuck [Sears, Roebuck and Co.], I wanted to learn how General Motors [General Motors Corporation; General Motors Company] started, I wanted to know more about Ford Motor Company, I also wanted to know more about Magee Financial [Magee Financial, LLC, Franklinton, Louisiana], I wanted to know more about the person who owned the restaurant.  How do you start an enterprise?  Well there's nothing, there was nothing in the education component except one thing, and that was coming out of Booker T. Washington's Negro Business League [National Negro Business League].  So certainly we had a bus- Negro Business League where, where I grew up and that is an emphasis on business enterprise, so I kind of grew up in the heyday, right at the end of segregation where the enclave, the business enclave was the most important for me.  The enclave, I mean things today like Chinatown, the little Vietnamese areas, in the old days it's Germantown in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], it's Little Italy in Cleveland [Ohio], it's Greektown in Chicago [Illinois], where people are of the same culture and same race would come together and essentially figure out a way how to create a business enterprise to draw money from the larger population.  See, Chinatown in New York [New York] was developing into a ghetto for example until immigration from China began to happen in the 1960s.  So, I've always been fascinated.  And I know one thing: that the black population in terms of entrepreneurship, their lives haven't changed.  That is, the entrepreneurs, the Gates [Bill Gates], the Gastons in Alabama, who gave a lot to the Civil Rights Movement, that he, he understood a process of how you live and adjust to America.  And I think that what I like to do is study those people who create the future through entrepreneurship, so it's fascinating to me.  You can either create the future by, through politics which is fine, but as I said, I don't know anybody who came to America to vote, people came to America for opportunities.  So I placed a study in the context of early black entrepreneurship, just like I look at Chinatown, so I, and I look at the outcomes, so if you look at my book on entrepreneurship, self-help, black entrepreneurs between the 1890s and 1960s educated their children just as Jewish entrepreneurs did in the Old South, and just as the Japanese entrepreneurs did on the West Coast.  As a matter of fact, W.E.B. Du Bois book, 'The College-bred Negro' ['The College-bred Negro: Report of a Social Study Made Under the Direction of Atlanta University'], 1911, showed that 100 percent of black college graduates had parents who had jobs and businesses, and then of course looking at the research, coming on down to the--Harris' book, 'The Negro As Capitalist' ['The Negro as Capitalist: A Study of Banking and Business Among American Negroes,' Abram L. Harris] had those kind of effects in it, and so, it's always been fascinating to me, but what I've done is to study black entrepreneurship, and I study that from a comparative point of view.  So it's not so much how much money you make as a value structure and as we enter the new century of course, black entrepreneurship is different, it's less likely to be enclaved.  So for example, in Atlanta [Georgia], when you do the index or the similarities, I think 80 percent of black enterprises is in the suburbs now.  Whereas in Detroit [Michigan], I think they're more likely to be in the context of the city, and so it's been fascinating to see how, how communities change based on entrepreneurship.  So, so you show me a city where the entrepreneurs are active and I'll show you a viable city, if you show me a city where the black population is active in entrepreneurship, I'll show you a viable city.  The opposite, I'll show you a different kind of city because the value structure is different.  So, I look at, I can look at Atlanta, Georgia for example, look at the history of, of Atlanta, Georgia, very, very entrepreneurial and then look at the impact that the Civil Rights Movement had on entrepreneurship in Atlanta because it was very entrepreneurial to start with and it was hosting the Olympics [1996 Summer Olympics, Atlanta, Georgia], maintaining colleges and universities whether it's the traditional black colleges [HBCUs] or the integrated colleges, you go to Detroit it's the opposite.  So the black population in Detroit is completely different from the black population in Atlanta based on the variable entrepreneurship.  And it's the same thing true of the white population, the Jewish population is so different, then other whites in America, because they had a, they have a high propensity to be entrepreneurs because of anti-Semitism, so in an interesting kind of way, wherever blacks were treated the worst historically is where they're better off today because of the history of entrepreneurship.
Story_ID: 632989
Speaker 1: When you talk about the northern cities versus the southern cities, when blacks moved to the northern cities their focus was on getting a job.  Do you think that they taught their children, get educated, get a job, whereas in the southern cities they were saying, yes, get an education so that you can be an employer?
Speaker 2: Well there were no jobs in the Old South, the best jobs in the Western world were in the northern cities, Boston [Massachusetts], Cleveland [Ohio], Chicago [Illinois], but of course that played out.  The problem is that when there are lots of factories and lots of opportunities, statistically the present education, so if you are growing up in Chicago, or if you're growing up in Detroit [Michigan], and there are factory workers making thirty bucks [dollars] an hour, why should you go to college?  You're growing up in Jackson, Mississippi, by the way, Mississippi leads the nation in the percentage of blacks finishing college, then the opportunity structure is different, that is the kind of jobs that were available at the early part of the century had to do with jobs revolving around the state, the segregated school systems for public school teachers and principals working in state government even today, and et cetera.  So, what happens is that also, the factory workers were less likely to educate their children or less likely to have generations going into the factories, going into the unions.  But there were no great jobs in the South, and so therefore, it was also true for our, the education rate in our, in the breadbasket of America is greater than the education rate where there's lots of factories, as I said earlier, factories have a tendency to be depressive.  And looking back then, what you see then is when the factories disappear, and you don't have any alternatives especially if you don't have an education their communities are more likely to disappear and this is what, what, like William Julius Wilson's work shows.  But that's, that is a Chicago phenomenon, that is not a Jackson, Mississippi phenomenon.  Now, there are poor people everywhere, the question is how do you make a living and can you make, do you have land to make a living.  But anyway, the difference is based on what happens to factories?  So, we sit here in Austin, Texas now with all of these great opportunities and high tech jobs, but if someone does not mind the store or creating a new company, then you would expect for those things to disappear as new technologies come aboard.  So, for example, the automobile replaced the horse, the combustion engine, in other words, replaced the horse, the computer replaced the typewriter and all of those things had jobs around them.  So, the study of entrepreneurship, it is the fundamental, it's the fundamental source of wealth creation and job creation in America, and of course if you go to other ways of creating, there's a state, that is, you could work for the state which is fine, but in terms of work creation and job creation, there's nothing like having the person to come out of Arkansas and do a company called Walmart [Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., Bentonville, Arkansas] that provides all kinds of opportunities, or a kid to come out of Memphis [Tennessee] to do a company called Federal Express [FedEx, Memphis, Tennessee], or a kid to start a Microsoft [Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, Washington], remember that most of the great companies that we have today were not around when I finished high school [Washington Parish High School, Franklinton, Louisiana], they were all done by entrepreneurs.  So, I always like to say, I tell my students put the emphasis on entrepreneurship, certainly you're gonna work for a job, but always keep in the back of your mind to what extent can you start a company to create wealth?  And the company does not have to be a Dell [Dell Inc.] computers or Whole Foods [Whole Foods Market, Inc.], it can be a lifestyle company that brings you a mere $300,000 a year or $1.5 million a year because small businesses provide most of the jobs in America.
Story_ID: 632990
Speaker 1: Do you want to talk about why is it that immigrants can come here and, as we talked about off camera, and start a business, and as African Americans, we still haven't gotten to that level where immigrants are as far as entrepreneurship?
Speaker 2: Well actually in the 1930s, black Americans had the highest percentage of business enterprises, but that was coming out of the newcomer foundation.  If you look at Morgan Livingston's [ph.] work, her work on the 1910 census, the black Americans was more likely to be self-employed than any group in America.  With immigrants, whether they are from whatever part of the world, are more likely to be self-employed than anyone and I like to say that the American dream is an immigrant's dream.  So right now, here in America, 17 percent of all kids in the Ivy League are of African origin, we have eight hundred kids of African origin at the University of Texas [University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas] with a GPA [grade point average] of 3.5 or better.  So what happens then is as you, the reason why the immigrants outperform us all is because they come to America looking for opportunities so the history of black entrepreneurship is a history of a lot of self-employment up through the Civil Rights Movement and then it dropping off afterwards because Americans for the most part are more likely to work as jobs.  Remember that, coming out of the 1970s, when the Japanese took over the industries, the automobile industry, and still disappeared in America, we hadn't taught entrepreneurship, right?  So as a matter of fact, if you look at Silicon Valley based on Saxenian's [AnnaLee Saxenian] work, 40 percent of the enterprises were done by immigrants.  So, the self-employment of black America reflected the fact that they're more likely to be Americans, and they're running around the same kind of statistics that Americans run in terms of starting enterprises, whereas Africans on the other hand, have a high propensity to start an enterprise, especially if they're Igbo because of their tradition in starting business enterprises.  So black entrepreneurship has got to be seen in its historical context.  The more you become an American, the less likely you're going to create the future for yourself.  Even when I study immigrant entrepreneurs, they don't talk about what they're doing, they talk about their son or daughter who are engineering majors at the university because they educate their kids away from entrepreneurship.  So the first generation created all of the companies, make all of the money, the second generation goes to college, the third generation struggles to go to college and the fourth generation drops off the plate, and somebody has to start all over again, so I think that understanding the process is understanding the history of entrepreneurship in America.  So, what immigration does is to revitalize entrepreneurship in America, and this is why there are great cities like San Francisco [California] and New York [New York], remember that when we were in high school, when I was in high school [Washington Parish High School, Franklinton, Louisiana], Miami [Florida] was dying, and Castro [Fidel Castro] said there would be a new Havana [Cuba] 'cause we're gonna be Communist, and then he said there would be a new Havana, but he didn't know that the new Havana was gonna be in Miami.  So people left Cuba, the immigrants created an entrepreneurial boom among, around the Cuban enclave in Miami.  Miami replaced New Orleans [Louisiana] as an importer, see, and Dade County [Florida] had the fastest growing business community in America in the 1970s and 1980s, because they came as entrepreneurs.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: So, if you wanna make some money, go move in with an immigrant.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: With an African immigrant for about six months (laughter).
Story_ID: 632991
Speaker 1: Let's go back to the time of, I guess it's 2000, when George Bush [President George Walker Bush], you're elected to the committee advisory team?
Speaker 2: Yes George is a--the president, excuse me, the president is a good friend, and he was governor of the State of Texas, and when they were putting his advisory team there were two professors who were asked, Michael Porter from Harvard University [Cambridge, Massachusetts] and myself from the University of Texas [University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas], and our job was to look at the entrepreneur research and to help him form the government at that time on issues revolving around entrepreneurship.  And from, I guess, Michael Porter's point of view, what had been happening around Route 128 [Massachusetts Route 128] in Boston [Massachusetts], and from my point of view, why Texas was so different in terms of the entrepreneurial spirit.  That is, why we have we done all of these companies here and how could that be spread to the rest of America.  So I served on the committee, the economic committee for the election of the president, the election of Governor George Bush to the presidency of the United States which was very exciting in itself.
Speaker 1: So you are Republican?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I think that the tradition of business enterprises--see up until Goldwater [Barry Goldwater], I guess 19- what, '60 [1960]?
Speaker 1: Sixty-four [1964].
Speaker 2: Sixty-four [1964], more black southerners were, were Republicans if they could vote, and I think with Goldwater, most people switched to the Republican Party.  And to me the Republican Party of Lincoln [President Abraham Lincoln], not necessarily the Republican Party we have today.  It's a party that looks, that concentrates on business enterprise and creating a future that is it's a party that essentially a big business the party that supports the development of business enterprises.  So where we are now, today, is that we are in a competitive world arena where our best jobs are going overseas, new technologies are coming along, you've got biotech, you got nanotech and the question for America to be competitive in the future just one, who are all the new technologies in the business enterprises of the future?  Will people migrate here and, and go to, to China to live or will they go back to Western Europe to live, if the country continues to not provide the different kinds of opportunities?  So I think that the traditional Republican Party has always been concerned with entrepreneurship and business enterprise.
Speaker 1: Do you remember the very first time that you voted?
Speaker 2: Do I remember the very first time that I voted?  I think I do, I remember the first time I made a dollar (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) When was, when was that?
Speaker 2: I think I, I think the first time that I voted might have been when I was in, in--when was the voting act passed?  Nineteen sixty-four [1964]?
Speaker 1: No, voting rights?
Speaker 2: Nineteen sixty [1960].
Speaker 1: It was right after--
Speaker 2: Vote, in 1966 wasn't it?  Voting Rights Act [Voting Rights Act of 1965]?
Speaker 1: Sixty-six [1966], or '67 [sic.].
Speaker 2: Sixty-six [1966], or '67 [1967]?  I voted in, I think that I voted, I know that I voted in college [Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge, Louisiana], yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I think that the vote is very, very important for the, for the movement of the country and the politics of the country, but I always tell my students, they say, "Well I wanna be president of the United States." I say, "Well, you know, the president, the White House [Washington, D.C.] is public housing," it's like living in a fancy Booker T. Washington [Booker T. Washington Terraces, Austin, Texas], Booker T. Washington public housing that, that we first started.  The question is, can you build your own White House?  (Laughter) If you're gonna do that, you can be a merchant.
Speaker 1: Were your parents [Johnnie Mae Sibley Butler and Thojest Butler, Sr.] political?
Speaker 2: No.  Not really.
Speaker 1: No?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Were they also (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Because remember--
Speaker 1: --Republican?
Speaker 2: --my parents could not--I think my father was, was, was a caring kind of person--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --and remember when I grew up we couldn't vote.
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I mean after (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) We didn't--
Speaker 1: --the '60s [1960s]--
Speaker 2: --have a vote--
Speaker 1: --they were able to vote, I mean you never talked to them about politics at all?
Speaker 2: --no.  They didn't, they weren't involved in organizing people for political stuff like we did in college and stuff, you know we had a, in college we organized people to vote and organized people to do this, but no, I think that my parents were more about education, and my father more about his own entrepreneurial kinds of activities.
Story_ID: 632992
Speaker 1: And that was in 2000, then in 2003, you're appointed to the Fulbright scholarship [Fulbright Fellowship], tell me about that (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.  Well the Fulbright board, of course, is the goodwill portion for American society, and I'm a presidential appointment to the Fulbright board, William Fulbright [J. William Fulbright] was a senator from Arkansas who set aside money so that people could come to America and scholars and students can go to America and I got the call from the White House [Washington, D.C.] that the president [President George Walker Bush] wanted to appoint me to the Fulbright board when, when he was first elected I went up and looked at some stuff around the Pentagon [Washington, D.C.], that is and whether it would be the undersecretary of the army or secretary of the army or I looked at stuff and just explored those kinds of things, and decided I wanted to come back to Austin.  And so I've been a member of the Fulbright board, I was just appointed again last week, and in that connect what we do is give scholarships, you know nine hundred, I think, to people around the globe.  I was a visiting professor in China last summer and hosted Fulbright in China, I was a visiting professor in Japan for, for fourteen years or so and the Fulbright board hosted me there and it is the country's way of reaching out so that people can understand the American culture.  And of course there's the fall of the Soviet Union, and how countries are coming to market economies.  Then, the American way of doing things, especially in terms of market economies has sort of taken over the world.  So China has a market economy on top of a Communist government, the former Soviet Union, the Russians are trying to make it as a market economy, Poland is trying to make it as a market economy, it's hard to do when you've been a Communist for so long.  And so I think that the sharing of knowledge from the American tradition is a market economy, this is very, very important, of course, most Fulbrights do pottery in 18th century Spain, and language, and all those great kind of things too that comes out of sciences and liberal arts.  But, it's been a great time, I've learned a lot, a great board and have--and I see it as serving my country, yes, so I served my country in Vietnam, now I've served my country on the William J. Fulbright Board [J. William Fulbright Foreign Scholarship Board].
Story_ID: 632993
Speaker 1: Tell me at least one story about conversations with President Bush [President George Walker Bush].
Speaker 2: Conversations with President Bush?  (Laughter) Well we were playing golf--
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: --playing golf at one time at Barton Creek [Texas], and he likes to hit, hit the golf ball, and he had a little machine with him and I was trying to figure out what it was, well he owned the range at that time, it was the first time that I'd ever seen someone follow a baseball game exactly while they were playing golf.  And so I said, "My gosh, that machine is good."  He said, "Well you know, I own, I'm a part owner of the Rangers [Texas Rangers], and I think that I can follow my team," and then we went to dinner one night at Alan Sager's house, we went to Seder, which is the celebration of the Jewish tradition.
Speaker 1: Friday night dinner?
Speaker 2: Yes, we went to it and we sat through three hours of Jewish tradition and we, we--and you know he's a real, real fun guy, you know and so, you know as families are there, and I can remember Alan had a daughter, and so we were leaving, this big long limousine came to pick up the governor, the little girl was maybe ten years old came out and said, "Now I wanna know why you have a limousine and everybody else has a regular car," and he just said, "Well because I'm the governor."  She said, "Oh," (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so it's pretty interesting.
Story_ID: 632994
Speaker 1: Did you say that you lived in Japan?
Speaker 2: I was a professor at Aoyama Gakuin [Aoyama Gakuin University] in Japan [Tokyo, Japan] for fourteen years in the summer, I taught an M.B.A. program, the entrepreneurship in Japan, as a fellow, from the IC^2 Institute [Innovation, Creativity and Capital Institute] as a professor at the University of Texas [University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas].
Speaker 1: What was that like living in Japan?
Speaker 2: Well it was very good 'cause it is so different, the language is very different, and I think the last three years I just requested to live in Japanese only hotels so I could get around, you know, (speaking Japanese), and I could, I could get a taxi, it's a very interesting language.  You know I do French pretty well and I do English pretty well, I do jive very well too, by the way (laughter).
Speaker 1: Let me hear (laughter).
Speaker 2: But it was good, it was good, it was different because they have a different kind of entrepreneurial culture.  It would be done I think out of large companies there, that is the individual entrepreneurial spirit is not the same as America, and Japan would solve its own future by depending probably on large companies and continuing to turn out products based on entrepreneurship, or entrepreneurship within large companies.  The opposite is true of China.  I was a professor in China last year, year before last.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And the entrepreneur spirit there is much more like the Western tradition even though it's based on an economy society, what China is doing is very, very interesting and if you add the innovation to it, that is if they ever make their own televisions, their own automobiles, their own airplanes, they don't need the rest of the world for customers.  And so, I think that China represents the future in a lot of ways.  I think that it is gonna be a, a great competitor to innovation and job creation and web creations in America.  And again, as I said earlier, staying ahead on the innovation, innovative curve, that is, what will products look like?  What will manufacturing look like?  Would it be nanomanufacturing, would it be biomanufacturing, becomes very important for the 21st century.

Speaker 1: Now tell me about your music, still playing the guitar?
Speaker 2: I play guitar and I sing, and I play piano and I sing, and I'm the best that there ever was, I'm just not publishing (laughter).
Speaker 1: That's how you, you spend your (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I do, well--
Speaker 1: --down time?
Speaker 2: --I do, you know I play piano, I like to play all Motown [Motown Records] songs, I like to play, you know, Temptations [The Temptations] songs, I'm a fan of Lionel Richie, I like Lionel Richie's music and I like Bill Withers' music, I like to play his music on the guitar, and of course that was in the 1970s, and I can do all the stuff from, you know, 'Use Me' to 'Sweet Wanomi,' "Sleeping in my dreams."  I do a lot of Willie Nelson stuff, my wife [Rosemary Griffey Butler] is a Willie Nelson fan, Willie Nelson is from here, from Austin [Texas], so I like to play a lot of his songs.  I played a classic guitar with a violinist in my church I used to attend.  And I like playing, I played for the, for members of my golf club, and so I just like music, it's what I like to do.  I never did drink, I never did any drugs, I just like music.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So that's been my--you know, I go home and take my guitar and I play for a long time.  As a matter of fact, I started cutting a CD last year, and I wrote the official song for the Rose Bowl [Rose Bowl Game] when Texas [University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas] went to the Rose Bowl last year in 2004 and--
Speaker 1: What was the name of that song?
Speaker 2: 'Pasadena and the Rose Bowl' [ph.].
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: I'll let you hear it before--
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: --before we leave.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now talking about music, you mentioned about the Kappas [Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity] and having a problem with the hip hop culture, what do you think (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh--
Speaker 1: --about hip hop?
Speaker 2: --well I think that it's different, I think they're much, much different than anything that the society and black America has seen.
Story_ID: 632996
Speaker 1: So we were talking about hip hop music.
Speaker 2: Hip hop music, yeah.  It's interesting to me, it's sort of a throwback, you know, it's kind of like music at the turn of the century where you just play the music and talk, it's kind of like a Johnny Cash, you know, where you just play the music and you know, "My daddy left home when I was three and didn't leave much for ma and me but this old guitar and an empty bottle of booze," ['A Boy Named Sue'] and you just play the music behind that.  So, I think from music structurally, you know, you know, music has different kinds of structures, I think it just has a beat and I think you talk and it's not like [HistoryMaker] Isaac Hayes, Isaac Hayes was more of a musical kind of rap, it's to me, it's more like a country mess, country western beat and where you just kind of talk and which is interesting.  So it's not like a, you know, the soulful singing of The Temptations or the soulful singing of people actually singing, although I guess it's getting mixed now, so I certainly can play it because it's very simple to do, you just play the background and then you talk.  But it also had--the other thing interesting is that it's, I mean visually it's like the skinheads, I don't know if you remember the white skinheads who cut all their hair off and put earrings on.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: And put tattoos all over their bodies, and if they were intellectual property, they should sue the hip hop artists because it was the white skinheads who did that, which is probably the first time that black artists ever took something from the white culture, which is interesting in itself.  But you know when blues came out, or when Elvis Presley started singing, there was a lot of reaction, but a different kind of reaction, you know there was a lot of reaction to blues in--as a matter of fact, there was a reaction to Motown [Motown Records].  So to my parents [Johnnie Mae Sibley Butler and Thojest Butler, Sr.] it was Nina Simone, it was [HistoryMaker] Nancy Wilson, you know and then when Motown came out, that was so different, it was a jazz, it was so different, and if you look at, I think if you look at black music, and look at well, what Ray Charles did with gospel, I mean, I mean is it, it's what?  Ray singing gospel (laughter), you know.  And because gospel didn't get here until the 1950s, so I've had a deep interest in music, I like to play it all on the piano so I can do most of Ray Charles on the piano, I like to do Lionel Richie.
Speaker 1: What's your favorite Lionel Richie song?
Speaker 2: 'Hello,' I like 'Hello.'
Speaker 1: Give us a little rendition.
Speaker 2: (Singing) "Is it me you're looking for, and I wonder where you are,"--
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: --I like, I like 'Hello' and I like 'Say You, Say Me.' I like 'Easy,' and so it's, I like those songs.  I like, I really like Bill Withers, yeah.  Give me a guitar and I'll sing for you (laughter).
Story_ID: 632997
Speaker 1: GloFish.
Speaker 2: Glofish.
Speaker 1: GloFish, Inc., tell me about GloFish?
Speaker 2: Well GloFish is a company that I was the first investor.  And basically it came from science and we have commercialized that, and of course what I do as director of the IC2 [Innovation, Creativity and Capital Institute], with the incubator is to create companies and GloFish is done by Alan Blake, who is a former student here in the business school [McCombs School of Business, Austin, Texas].  GloFish, Yorktown Technologies [Yorktown Technologies, L.P.], that's where he's from in Yorktown [New York].  And, you know the businesses for the 21st century will come out of the laboratory, it is the first genetically altered pet that we have.  And the scientist were trying to create a fish that would change colors when the water was polluted, much like the canaries and much like the bass, and so they took the genetics out of a fruit fly and put into a zebra fish and created a freshwater fish that looks exactly like a saltwater fish.  And so, we did the first investment, we started the company and so it's a business enterprise, that is what I like to do in my time here, not only research and write and administrate but also start companies.  So many of my students have started business enterprises and some of those have done extremely well.  And so GloFish represents a continuation of the Booker T. Washington effective saying, Booker T. Washington said the following: anyone who has anything to bring to the market can do exceptionally well in America.  And as I said earlier, remember it was George Washington Carver who took the peanut and created all kind of interests, including the paint for Ford Motor Company.  So, what I like to do is encourage people to look at the new science and ask how can you engage in technology transfer, how can you take the new technologist out of the laboratories and create new companies and in the 21st century medicine will become more of a science as they, as they map the genome, we will.  Nanobiology is a reality, engineering is becoming nanoengineering, operations are different than they used to be, and all of these new ideas require that someone commercialize them.  So we need companies to create the small affairs and nano affairs.  We need companies that create all of the new ideas of business enterprises because believe it or not, the silicon, the silicon sort of tradition will last and computer will also go through a new kind of generation.  We know that there will be a new kind of computer company, and we want that company to be a Michael Dell, we know that there will be a new can- kinds of organizations and we have to do those things.  So GloFish is a company, I'm on the board and it's been exciting, it's a technology transfer company and we hope we continue to do well.
Story_ID: 632998
Speaker 1: Is there anything that we have not talked about that you would like to talk about up to this point?  Like maybe, your wife [Rosemary Griffey Butler] and your children?
Speaker 2: Oh okay, I married a girl--
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: --from Cleveland, Ohio, we were as different as the--when she saw me she said I was introduced to her as being right off the plantation, since I was from, from Louisiana.  She grew up in Cleveland, in Englandville [ph.], and I met her as a student at Northwestern University [Evanston, Illinois], and it was cold at Northwestern, but it was worth it because I married the prettiest girl from Cleveland, Ohio.  And we have one son, who's, you know, gone through high school and is twenty-nine years old, and we've been married, oh, thirty-four years, and she has her own career, she works for the attorney general's office.  And we, we do a lot together and so we've been married, I can't even remember when I wasn't married (laughter).
Speaker 1: And what's your son's name?
Speaker 2: John.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: John Sibley Butler [John Butler].  You know the tidbit is my legal name is Johnnie Sibley Butler, but what happened is, there were three Englishmen publishing under Johnnie Sibley Butler, so I picked up my grandfather's name, John Sibley, so I wouldn't be confused with them in the publication rights.  So my son is really named after my grandfather, John Sibley.
Story_ID: 632999
Speaker 1: When you think back over your life, is there anything that you would change?
Speaker 2: I would take flying lessons.
Speaker 1: Is that something you've always wanted to do?
Speaker 2: Well I think, I thought about it, my wife [Rosemary Griffey Butler] says that I always tell her she wouldn't allow me to do that.  But I think that if I had to do it again, I'll take flying lessons and fly my own airplane, and I think that's about it though.  I mean I cannot, I thought that socialization where I grew up was just absolutely, you know, fantastic because of the way it was, the way it was done and, and a lot of changes have taken place but that's the one thing that I would do.
Story_ID: 633000
Speaker 1: What is your concern today about the African American community?  What is maybe just one concern of yours?
Speaker 2: Well the, the bifurcation is, is interesting, that is, on the one hand the community's doing better than it's ever done, it's just like the regular society, that is when E. Franklin Frazier wrote the book, 'Black Bourgeoisie,' all the things that he described just gone the other way, and when, when it's changed, to me as a southerner is that I grew up with everybody, now people can live wherever they want to live.  So now, black Americans are more likely to live with their own economic kind, whether they're black, white, Asian, or whatever have you.  And the concern is--the concern that any family would have, how do you continue to educate people and how would, would people do well in the 21st century?  Because remember coming out of slavery there's a great celebration.  All the people asked for was freedom, they created towns in Oklahoma, they started colleges and they started universities.  Coming out of the Civil Rights Movement, we sort of lost the deal for the economics, and that has to be replaced, and I think Africans will, will do that.  You wonder why there aren't private black schools [HBCUs] all over the country, now, why isn't there a Tougaloo [Tougaloo College, Tougaloo, Mississippi] in Detroit [Michigan]?  Because black southern culture is so much different than northern black culture, it is as black and white.  And I think the concern is that you have to have families to educate children, when I say education it can be formal education, or know how to do something, I mean, do you know how to do something, to take it to the market?  So it's a concern, and that hasn't changed since the ancient Greeks, you go back and read today on ancient Greece and they're concerned about their children and, but what has happened is that the media has focused more on problems within black America rather than on what black Americans have done.  So very few people know about, I mean you would never see a movie on how Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia] was created, and all the graduates, you just won't see that in America and of course, great communities that people tried to create have become hoods, that's a bad thing, you should never say the Rust Belt.  You should live in a neighborhood, and the whole ghettoization of black America has been commercialized, that is, it's all on the commercials as to say that this is how all black Americans should live, well now it's commercialized, I mean the culture has been commercialized so you look at commercials and everything is about what they call inner city black Americans, but the inner cities are rapidly being converted to great places, and my advice is, is that black Americans live in the best land in the Western world.  Without entrepreneurship in cities then it's gonna disappear.
Story_ID: 633001
Speaker 1: Now because this information, your life story, will be reference material for future generations, what message would you like to send to the future generations?
Speaker 2: Future generations is, read Booker T. Washington, and read about all of the colleges and schools and universities and businesses that were created between the end of slavery and the 1960s, learn 'Lift Every Voice and Sing,' because that is a chronology of the celebration at the end of slavery and no group can prosper without referring to the best practices of past generations.  And black America did not start with the Civil Rights Movement, it did not start with the right to vote, what we did is very insignificant compared to what the ex-slaves did, that is, we marched, and we marched for people to, to like us but Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] pales in comparison to the Booker T. Washingtons of the world and all the people who started Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia].  You know, Martin was a third generation college graduate when he got to Morehouse and without Benjamin Mays, who might be the greatest of all Americans, they need to know who Benjamin Mays is 'cause he created the eloquence of a Martin Luther King and he created the elegance, they need to know about all of the black enterprises that were created in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and in America it's what you can do and bring to the marketplace.  So, the greatest generation in black America were those who came out of slavery, and had a vision, and was very successful in carrying it out.  By the time I finished high school [Washington Parish High School, Franklinton, Louisiana] there was a system of schooling, people were being educated, there was a whole system of teachers, there were businesspeople, there were people who laid bricks, there were people who built, there were engineers, all of this was in place.  So, you cannot not allow black America to start with the '60s [1960s] and the modern Civil Rights Movement because they made all of the '60s [1960s] people who they were as children.
Story_ID: 633002
Speaker 1: Now I know you have many, many, many, many more years to live.
Speaker 2: Oh, I don't know (laughter)--
Speaker 1: But how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: --how would I like to be remembered?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: I've never been asked that before.  Well, as a, I think that, I'd like to be remembered as someone who teach people how to live well in America and on the continent and I think that my, my students over the last thirty-plus, thirty-three years here at the University of Texas [University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas], you know I hear from them, you know, all the time and I think my books and my articles would reflect the fact that people have to learn how to think and act like free people.  I think that thinking and acting like you're free is very difficult for people to do.  So, I have a concept I call free thinking people, and free thinking people have always been dangerous, these are the people who created America, these are the people who created Ford Motor Company, these are the people who created Tulsa, Oklahoma, they were free thinking people, they created--I write about Durham, North Carolina, at the turn of the century, free thinking people also created the State of Texas, and when you think and act like a free person, then you have to realize that it's up to you to determine the future and the context of where you are.  And most Americans cannot think and act like they're free, we depend on other people to create the future for us.  And only a small segment of Americans are free thinking people, and of course to me the ultimate form of a free thinking person is someone who figures out what they have to bring to the market, whether it's a Ray Charles who can play music, whether it is a Bill Gates who understands codes, you know, or whether it is an Oprah Winfrey who understands the whole idea of entertainment, and free thinking people have always advanced their knowledge especially when it comes to education.  So, for example, when Oprah started her schooling in Africa, it was just like starting at Spelman [Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia], you know, and, and that was a great thing.  The reason why Boston [Massachusetts] has so many colleges and universities is because free thinking people founded Boston, you know, the reason why there's a Baylor University [Waco, Texas] is because they were thinking like they were free and the reason why there's a BYU, a Brigham Young [Brigham Young University, Provo, Utah] is because they were thinking like they were free.  And the reason why there's a Tougaloo [Tougaloo College, Tougaloo, Mississippi], a Dillard University [New Orleans, Louisiana], a Spelman, a Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia], is because there were free thinking people, so how can you learn to live and think like a free person, that is the challenge, and America is the best place to do that.
