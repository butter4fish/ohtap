Story_ID: 608218
Speaker 1: Before we go into depth, there are five lightweight, People magazine-ish type questions that management compels me to ask of people--
Speaker 2: (Laughter)
Speaker 1: --and they only require short answers.
Speaker 2: Okay.

Story_ID: 608219
Speaker 1: Now, I'm gonna ask about your family history.
Speaker 2: Uh-hm.
Speaker 1: I'm gonna ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's [Robert H. Jordan, Sr.] side, but we'll start with your mother's side.  Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: My mother's full name is Millicent, M-I-L-L-I--C-E-N-T, Dobbs [Millicent Dobbs Jordan], no middle name, D-O-B-B-S.
Speaker 1: And what was her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Atlanta, Georgia, and I think 1912.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, what do you know about the ancestors on your mother's side, how far back can you trace those ancestors?
Speaker 2: My father--my grandfather was the son of slaves.  And there has been a, a genealogical study done and I don't remember all of those dates as well as I should.  I, I do plan to go back and refresh my memory on those, but I do know that on my mother's side she talked about her father and her mother's [Irene Thompson Dobbs]--I, I don't remember her talking about her grandparents.  So I, I, I think that's about as far as I could go.  And I think that there has been some studies done on that though.
Speaker 1: Now, you're related on your mother's side to John Wesley Dobbs, right?
Speaker 2: That's correct.
Speaker 1: And is that your, your grandfather?
Speaker 2: My grandfather's name was John Wesley Dobbs.
Speaker 1: And he's, he's quite a figure in Atlanta history, history on--
Speaker 2: Yes.  He was--John Wesley Dobbs was a railway postal clerk during the time when the mail primarily was carried by the rails.  And, he was in charge--what made it so unusual though was that, packed a gun and was in charge of a six-man crew, all of whom were white.  So for a black man in turn of the century, the early part of say, maybe nineteen- early 1900s, to be on the railroad and in charge of a crew and making sure that the mail made its way wherever was quite an unusual event.  Because most blacks at that time, or most Negros, at that time were--who worked on the railroad, worked in the capacity of either porters or--most of the time porters or in other capacities of that nature.
Speaker 1: Right, brakemen and such, cooks, and so (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right. That's correct, yes, worked dining cars and that sort of thing.
Speaker 1: So, he was, he was security you're saying?
Speaker 2: He was--he worked for the government.
Story_ID: 608220
Speaker 1: This was the time (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) He was like, like Pinkerton [Allan Pinkerton] or something, or, or--
Speaker 1: Well, what happened, the government took over the mail and it has a Chicago [Illinois] connection believe it or not.  And, I, I'm not completely certain about this but the Kimball piano company [W.W. Kimball Company; Kimball International] is here in Chicago, and when Kimball [William Wallace Kimball] was trying to--had a--trying to keep down a strike of workers at his piano company, he was able to get the government to--or was this Pullman [Pullman Company]--I'm sorry, that's George Pullman.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But Kimball had something to do with that too.  But anyway, it was George Pullman who, who made the Pullman car, the, the, the overnight sleeper.  There's a whole section of Chicago on the South Side, where they were made and manufactured, and all the workers lived in the area.
Speaker 2: Yeah, 111th [Street] and Cottage Grove [Avenue].
Speaker 1: That's correct.  To break the strike, Pullman had the government take over the mail service so then, at that time, the workers could no longer strike against the government.  So the mail was able to go through.  Now, I--
Speaker 2: Okay, so that was a way for the--for Pullman to keep rolling because he (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) To keep the trains, to keep the trains rolling.  That's right.  If he had a government contract, then the workers couldn't strike against the United States government to stop the mail.  So, Pullman was able to break the strike and what happened was, after his death, there was so much hatred against Pullman that in Graceland Cemetery [Chicago, Illinois] where he is buried, supposedly, there is not only a false grave but the vault in which he is encased was covered with cement and railroad ties to keep people from coming in and defacing the grave.  So that's how much animosity there was.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think like people were killed I think, shot down in the fields surrounding the Pullman plant, I believe (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That is correct.
Story_ID: 608221
Speaker 1: My [maternal] grandfather [John Wesley Dobbs] benefitted from the fact that the government now operated the mail service.  And, how he obtained the position of chief mail clerk on the rail service I don't know.  But I do remember that he had to carry a gun and he was in charge of a crew of white men who were letter carriers on the trains.
Speaker 2: Now, did he have a background in the [U.S.] military prior to--
Speaker 1: No background in the military.
Speaker 2: Or in law enforcement?
Speaker 1: No, as a matter of fact, he attended Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia] at I think in the class of '02 [1902] for a couple of years.  But, at any rate after he retired, he was very active in the Masons and went on to become grand master of the Masons in Atlanta, Georgia.  And was a, a speaker who toured all around going to the various chapters of the Masons throughout the South.  And so he became an orator who was very well known because of much of his travels on the railroad.  And he would tell me as a child about his days traveling the railroad and many of his stories, how he traveled throughout the Jim Crow South but had regular places where he could stay.  Nashville [Tennessee] was a favorite spot of his because he could go to Fisk University [Nashville, Tennessee] and read in the library.  And, I remember him taking me to one colored hotel where he could stay.  It's a small place, maybe like a three-flat, but I remember that, him taking me there later in life when I was living in Nashville, and showing me where one of his stops was.  And he made many friends in Nashville and knew lots of people.  And, so he would stop all along--he knew all of these cities all along the way of the railroad, which traveled throughout the South.  So, his notoriety grew as he traveled through all of these locations and this enabled him to later parlay I guess much of that as he became--as he moved up through the ranks of the Masons and became grand master in Atlanta, which I guess was the southeastern regional area for the Masons at that time.  And his wife, Irene Dobbs [Irene Thompson Dobbs], was over the Eastern Stars [Order of the Eastern Star], which was the maternal organization or the sister organization for the Masons.
Story_ID: 608222
Speaker 1: What particular aspect of his career I guess gave him the most notoriety, because there's a street [John Wesley Dobbs Avenue] named after John Wesley Dobbs in Atlanta [Georgia] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's correct.  He, as I said, was grand master of the Masons, and that gave him a platform.  And I can remember vaguely as a child walking with him down Auburn Avenue.  Auburn Avenue was the main colored strip that ran through the neighborhoods, which back then, I remember my grandfather called (gesture) Darktown [Atlanta, Georgia], which was where some of the slums were off of Auburn Avenue.  But there were the main businesses, the pharmacies, the fish store, the five and dime store, all of the main businesses ran for maybe four, five, six blocks along Auburn Avenue which ended right at the edge of downtown Atlanta.  So this was really prime real estate, but it was off on the southeast side of the city in a ghetto.  And Atlanta has since spread out for miles and miles and miles in all directions.
Speaker 1: Like, uncharacteristic of the north of this strip was, was predominantly by black businesses, right?
Speaker 2: That's right.  One of the things that helped to get--there were several reasons why Atlanta became such a mecca for black businesses.  One, being Auburn Avenue in the beginning, the other, the fact that there are the colleges and educational institutions there.  The, the huge sites of learning, Spelman [Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia], Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia], Morris Brown [Morris Brown College, Atlanta, Geogia], Clark [Clark College; Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia] Atlanta University [Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia], Interdenominational Theological Seminary [sic. Interdenominational Theological Center, Atlanta, Georgia], all in this one cluster.  But, because of them they fed the city with an intellectual that spread out through the city and gave it it's base.  Because of Spelman and Morehouse, Atlanta always had a, a strong black intellectual base and a business base upon which the rest of the city was able to build.
Story_ID: 608223
Speaker 1: He [Jordan's maternal grandfather] was known to walk from one part of Auburn Avenue to the next, stopping in stores and talking to people, he'd go in the barbershop.  I can, to this day, remember him in the barbershop and he would be there, and there'd be some discussion going about something and he get in--these would be heated discussions and he was almost preaching.  But he was a scholarly gentleman who had a library in his home, the first home that I can remember going in that had a library.  My father [Robert H. Jordan, Sr.] had a library, my mother [Millicent Dobbs Jordan] had a library and I have a library.  And books have been important to all of us and learning and reading.  And so, I mean, here's a man who was born the son of slaves but had enough savvy to realize the importance of books and learning and reading that he had a library in his home.  And so, he was well known up and down the strip of Auburn Avenue, and gave it the name Sweet Auburn [Atlanta, Georgia], which lives to this day.  So, if there was an unofficial mayor of Auburn Avenue, it was probably John Wesley Dobbs.  So, that was how he was so well known.  Amassed a fair amount of money from his speaking engagements traveling all the time, driving to churches and places all over the South.  So he lived comfortably. He had six daughters, no boys.  He adopted a boy later on who was kind of adopted from some other family.  But, all of his daughters, he was able to put through Spelman College [Atlanta, Georgia] and graduate school, and some post-graduate school.  But this was almost unheard of at that time, I mean, most black people didn't even go to college or many didn't even go to finish high school.  We're talking about a time, when most colored people didn't finish high school, he was sending his daughters on to graduate school.  So, it was quite an accomplishment, and they all did well and all married well.  And that helped to continue the growth of the family in prosperity.  And his values and principles of education and church and civic affiliations, and giving back to the community, all of that continued through his progeny which were his six daughters.  And they in turn were able to pass that on to my generation, and we, hopefully, have continued to pass it on through our generations.
Story_ID: 608224
Speaker 1: I guess it's--it's would be interesting I guess to kind a walk through the daughters, you know, and, and just, you know, these are your, your mother and her sisters.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And just tell us something about 'em.  I know they, they have some interesting stories?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  The oldest daughter was Irene Dobbs Jackson, who married a minister [Maynard Jackson, Sr.], who became the pastor of Friendship Baptist Church in Atlanta, Georgia.  Friendship is the home of [HistoryMaker] Andrew Young and many other local civic leaders there in Atlanta.  Her oldest son was Maynard Jackson, who went on to become the first black mayor of Atlanta.
Speaker 1: Okay, and that, that's your first cousin?
Speaker 2: That, and Maynard is my first cousin.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He--Irene had six children and Maynard was the oldest boy.  There was then--there was Sandra [Alexandra Jackson] the oldest daughter, then Maynard, then Jeanne [Jeanne Jackson], then Paul [Paul Jackson], Carol Ann [Carol Ann Jackson Miller], and Connie [Constance Jackson Carter].  The second daughter--the second sister was Willie Dobbs Blackburn, her husband [Benjamin Allan Blackburn] before he passed, was a coach at Jackson College in Jackson, Mississippi.  Jackson State, I think it was.  No, it was Jackson College then I think it became Jackson State [Jackson State College], now I think it's Jackson University [sic. Jackson State University] or something.  And she was a college professor and taught at Jackson College as well.  Irene, by the way backing up, was a concert pianist, had a Ph.D. from the Sorbonne [University of Paris] in Paris [France] so she studied overseas.  And that's where she obtained her Ph.D.  Willie had a master's [degree], had two children,  Ben [Benjamin Blackburn II] who is a dental- a dentist, and Juliet [HistoryMaker Juliet Dobbs Blackburn-Beamon] who is a college professor as well.  Third sister is my mother, Millicent [Millicent Dobbs Jackson], who married Robert Jordan [Robert H. Jordan, Sr.].  My father was a dentist.  She had three children, my twin brothers and myself.  One of my brothers [James Jordan] died about fifteen years ago and the surviving twin [Dobbs Jordan]--both finished Howard law school [Howard University School of Law, Washington, D.C.], neither practiced law.  One went to work for the City of Atlanta and the other is an Atlanta police officer who also has his own security company.  And, myself, reporter-anchor with WGN television [WGN-TV, Chicago, Illinois].
Story_ID: 608225
Speaker 1: The fourth sister was Josephine Dobbs Clement, who had five children, Alexine Clement [HistoryMaker Alexine Jackson], married to a urologist in Washington, D.C., Aaron Jackson, a very noted urologist, internationally known.  William Clement [HistoryMaker William A. Clement, Jr.], who has a computer company in Atlanta [Georgia]. Wesley Clement [Wesley Dobbs Clement], an ophthalmologist in Charlotte, North Carolina; Arthur John Clement [Arthur Clement], who is an architect now in Atlanta; Jody Clement [Josephine Clement Smart], who is--I'm missing someone.  I think Jody's--I'll have to check on that.  And then the fifth daughter is Mattiwilda Dobbs [HistoryMaker Mattiwilda Dobbs Janzon], who is a retired now, but a former Metropolitan opera singer and star.  The third African American to sing in the Metropolitan [Metropolitan Opera], first to sing a romantic role.  She was a coloratura soprano, internationally known, sang all over the world, in La Scala in Italy [Milan, Italy], and Covent Garden, England [Royal Opera House, London, England] and Glyndebourne [Lewes, England], and all over the world.  And as well as concertized here in the United States quite a bit.  She's now retired, she taught for a while at Howard University in Washington, D.C. and lived in Sweden for a number of years as did she and she--before that she lived in Majorca, Spain.  The sixth daughter is [HistoryMaker] June Dobbs Butts, B-U-T-T-S.  She was married to a psychiatrist, Dr. Hugh Butts [Hugh F. Butts] of Harlem Hospital [Harlem Hospital Center] in New York [New York].  They have two daughters, Flory [Florence Dobbs Johnson] and [Lucia Dobbs]--slips me right now.  That'll come to me as well.  And so, that's kind of the immediate family right now.  Of course, there have been--those grandchildren have now had great-grandchildren of John Wesley Dobbs and Irene Dobbs [Irene Thompson Dobbs] on my mother's [Millicent Dobbs Jordan] side.
Story_ID: 608226
Speaker 1: That makes quite of--for some rich family gatherings I would think, you know (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It does, there are--we haven't had family reunions recently.  We used to when my [maternal] grandfather was alive, we would have periodic--well, we'd have family reunions at least once a year.  When I was a boy, when I was born in 1943, World War II [WWII] was going on and my father [Robert H. Jordan, Sr.] was drafted into the [U.S.] Army.  So we lived in my grandfather's house, John Wesley Dobbs' house while my father was in the Army.  So, I was the first boy to ever live in his house, so I was kind of like his son, after having had six daughters, to now have me there.  And for his youngest two daughters, for Mattiwilda [HistoryMaker Mattiwilda Dobbs Janzon] and June [HistoryMaker June Dobbs Butts], I was kind of like the play toy for them because they were teenagers at the time.  They were young girls when I was a baby living there, so I was spoiled a lot as a little boy.  My grandfather would take me with him as I got older on his trips up and down Auburn Avenue [Atlanta, Georgia].  And I can still remember seeing him going in and out of many of these places talking to people and everyone knew him by name.  We'd stop in Ebenezer Baptist Church [Atlanta, Georgia] and Daddy King [Reverend Martin Luther King, Sr.] would be there.  And they would talk and, you know, we'd go in Big Bethel [Big Bethel A.M.E. Church, Atlanta, Georgia] and there would be--on, what's the minister's name there at the time, I can't remember.  And they would talk, but I got to know all of these people.  The King family and my grandfather's family were all very close.  June and M.L. King, Martin Luther King, Jr. [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.], were in the same class.  So, all of 'em were very close and Martin Luther King was teaching at Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia] when I was there later in college.  I did not have him for religion, which I wish I had, I think he had left by the time I was going to be able to, to take a, an elective as a religion class because I would have wanted to take his world religion course, which I understand was just great.  So, growing up I was in the household with my grandfather and had a very special place in his life and he in mine.  And, as we later moved when my father got out of the Army, we moved to Nashville, Tennessee, where my mother [Millicent Dobbs Jordan] and father both taught at Tennessee State [Tennessee Agricultural and Industrial State University; Tennessee State University, Nashville, Tennessee] and before my dad went to Meharry medical--dental school [Meharry Medical College School of Dentistry, Nashville, Tennessee].
Speaker 1: Okay, now, how long did your grandfather live?
Speaker 2: My grandfather lived--died on my birthday in 1979, August 31st.
Speaker 1: So, well, do you know his birthdate?
Speaker 2: I think he was in--I used to know it, I think he was in his mid-seventies. Mid to late seventies (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, so he was born around turn of the century?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 608227
Speaker 1: Okay, I was asking about your [maternal] grandfather's [John Wesley Dobbs] date of birth and place of birth.  You know, he was born in Atlanta [Georgia] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) He was born in Kennesaw, Georgia.
Speaker 1: Kennesaw, Georgia, okay.
Speaker 2: Right, just north of Atlanta.  And--which Atlanta now has grown beyond Kennesaw, the metropolitan Atlanta area.  But then, that was a day trip to go to Kennesaw and it was way out of town, I mean, even Marietta, back in those days was a long way away.  But now, that's--with all the expressways and so forth, that's nowhere. It's a part of metropolitan Atlanta.
Speaker 1: That's the same Kennesaw of Kennesaw Mountain fame, right?
Speaker 2: He, as a little boy with his cousin, Jess [ph.], would climb Kennesaw Mountain and collect arrowheads, and that was his hobby as a little boy, so they'd climb up and down Kennesaw Mountain and that's where he grew up.
Speaker 1: Okay, he was--would have been born in 1890s [sic. 1882]?
Speaker 2: He would have been born in the, in the late 1800s, around 1890s.  I'm guessing somewhere around there because I think that he--
Speaker 1: He died in '69 [1969] [sic. 1961]?
Speaker 2: I think it was '69 [1969].
Story_ID: 608228
Speaker 1: Did your mother [Millicent Dobbs Jordan] give, give you a sense of what it was like to grow up in Atlanta [Georgia] in those days when she grew up?
Speaker 2: Growing up in Atlanta during that time, they grew up in a home that was very strict.  My grandfather [John Wesley Dobbs]--you can imagine what these six, very attractive girls, very eligible, were sought after quite a bit.  But my grandfather, I can remember them saying, wouldn't even allow them to ride in cars.  And he bought his first car because he said he didn't want a car to be a novelty, that some slick guy could entice one of his daughters into a car.  So, he said he went out and bought his first car just so that his girls could ride in it and not find it to be so unusual that, that would happen.  Very strict household and very loving household with--all of these girls were raised as individuals each with her own ability to think and nothing was squelched.  They were taught, they were taught to allow yourselves to be individuals and to think and to question authority, which they all did.
Story_ID: 608229
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So they--it was a strict household but not an oppressive household (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) A strict household but not oppressive, not oppressive at all.  I can remember as a young man hearing--we--Sunday dinner was always a huge gathering.  Whenever we would go to my [maternal] grandfather's house [John Wesley Dobbs] there were always people there.  He would cook, sometimes he'd go down to the municipal market and buy fresh fish and take and bring it home and scale it, and, and prepare it.  And it would always be people cooking, cooking in the house.  There were aromas coming out of that house all the time.  And so, the meal was a big deal, especially on Sundays, after church.  And, there would be so many of us that there would be a kids' table in the corner or in another room, and the big dining room table where all the adults were, you know, and sometimes they would whisper.  And you always wonder what were they talking about, and you never found out but, yeah, that was it.  But then these arguments would erupt.  And, as a child, I often thought they were arguments, but they were just discussions where they would challenge authority.  And my mother [Millicent Dobbs Jordan] was one of them, she and my grandfather, her father, would sometimes be at odds on issues and many times it could only be resolved by going to the dictionary or to the encyclopedia, and that's the way they would resolve an issue.  But there would be these very intense discussions all the time.  And that continued as anytime mom and all of us would go home in later years.  We'd end up finishing the meal but sitting around the table sometimes for hours talking about topics, about issues, about things.  And the seeds were planted among all of his daughters and the grandchildren that discussion is healthy.  Thinking is healthy.  And trying to look at issues as good, and so that's, that was integral to the family to try and challenge authority and get to the roots of this and that and the other.  Many times the dictionary was right there or this huge encyclopedia or something was right there on the table as a reference (laughter) to try and settle some of the many arguments that would inevitably develop.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, so they were over points of grammar or--
Speaker 2: Not just points of grammar but facts concerning dates or whatever, and they would be challenged.  These discussions would be far ranging and would be on maybe current events, world issues, historical facts, whatever.  I mean, there were no limitation to what the current discussion might be going on at that dinner table.
Speaker 1: But you had to get your facts straight?
Speaker 2: Absolutely, and you'd be challenged if you weren't careful.  You couldn't just spout off anything without somebody saying, "Wait a minute, what about that?  I'm not so sure about that."  And, that's when we'd have to go somewhere to find out what's the truth.
Story_ID: 608230
Speaker 1: Now, as we sit here in your house, we're surrounded by beautiful works of art, lots of African art.  And your, your mother [Millicent Dobbs Jordan] was a specialist in African art, right?
Speaker 2: My mother fell in love with Africa.  And made twenty-some trips to Africa during her adult years.  Even one summer, spending time at the University of Lagos [Lagos, Nigeria] studying.  Because, as a professor, they started African studies in the '60s [1960s] and the '70s [1970s] at many of the colleges.  And, Spelman [Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia] where she taught was a United Negro College Fund [UNCF] school and along with the AU Center [Atlanta University Center; Atlanta University Center Consortium, Atlanta, Georgia] they began some black studies programs.  She had historically taught speech, English, speech and drama throughout most her career, but then she broke into the black studies program as well.  She even taught my wife [Sharon Lundy Jackson].
Speaker 1: Now, was she, was she a graduate of Spelman?
Speaker 2: She was--all the six sisters--
Speaker 1: All of them at Spelman (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) were graduates from Spelman.
Speaker 1: I just wondered if she had encountered along the way William Leo Hansberry, the Africanist--the only one teaching about Africa really in the black colleges back in the--
Speaker 2: When, when was--
Speaker 1: Yeah, Hansberry taught from the 1920s through the '50s [1950s] at, at Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.], you know.
Speaker 2: Maybe, but she got her masters in--at Columbia College, I mean, at Columbia University [New York, New York].  So, she was there during the Harlem Renaissance period, happen to know many of those people, and many of those artists were friends of hers.  And, Aaron Douglas, she later commissioned a wonderful painting when she was in Nashville [Tennessee], that my brother [Dobbs Jordan] has in his home.  A beautiful oil that she commissioned Aaron Douglas to paint for her, and so art has been something that we grew up appreciating.  And I've just about run out of wall space here in my home, but I just--as she felt, I feel it's so important, it so enriches the spirit to have--to be surrounded by art.
Speaker 1: Okay, she knew also [HistoryMaker] Allen Stringfellow, Romare Bearden
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.  Actually, I met Allen first.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Now, my mother was a close friend of Romare Bearden's and as you can see we have one there, one there, there's one back in another room that my mother kept my father [Robert H. Jordan, Sr.] working all the time to (laughter) to help feed her love of art and her travels around the world.  Well, she worked too as a, as a professor at Spelman, but she had a love of art and I'm sure my father spent a couple of extra hours in bending over someone's mouth (laughter) in his, in his practice to help support her, her travels.
Story_ID: 608231
Speaker 1: And, in your mother's [Millicent Dobbs Jordan] I guess later years at Spelman [Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia], she led a, a demonstration against the school administration for--
Speaker 2: My mother was, as I said, very outspoken, almost radical.  And this came from her days--and in New York in Harlem [New York, New York] in grad school [Columbia University, New York, New York] with those artists in the Harlem Renaissance.  And she was always forward thinking, and after Dr. Manley [Albert Manley] died, who had been the president of Spelman for a number of years, my mother had taught there for thirty-odd years or more and felt that it was time for a female institution like Spelman to have a female president.  And so when a male was appointed to replace Dr. Manley, my mother felt that, that was a slap in the face of the students who she felt were--should have an example as a female president.  So they organized a, a group and they eventually staged a sit-in demonstration in the administration building where they chained themselves to the doors and gained quite a bit of notoriety in Atlanta [Georgia] with the local press outside watching them while they took over this administration building, demanding that there be a female president selected as opposed to a male.  They eventually reached an accord and a male did come in.  And I'm, I'm groping for his name right now [Donald M. Stewart].  He and I have since talked and he and my mother became fast friends later, but that was just the way she was.  She believed in stepping up for issues that were important to her.
Speaker 1: Now, about what year was this that she staged the demonstration?
Speaker 2: I believe this was in the '70s [1970s], early '70s, I believe.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 608232
Speaker 1: Let's see, let's--I'm gonna leave your mother [Millicent Dobbs Jordan] for a minute and let's go to your father's side of the family.  Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) My father's full name is Robert Howard, H-O-W-A-R-D, Jordan, J-O-R-D-A-N [Robert H. Jordan, Sr.].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He was a dentist.
Speaker 1: And what's his date of birth?
Speaker 2: June 6th, 1916.  He was born in Wybark, Oklahoma.
Speaker 1: How do you spell Wybark?
Speaker 2: Wybark is W-Y-B-A-R-K, I believe.  It had the--it was an all-black town in Oklahoma.  And, from what I read in a book on black cowboys, Wybark was a notorious town.  And it had signs on either end that said no whites allowed after sundown, representative of what whites had done to Negros in the South in many areas.  My father was the oldest of five boys.  So--
Speaker 1: So, this is--well, he must have had some stories about growing up.  Now--
Speaker 2: He did (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) is there a, is there a, a--
Speaker 2: But he grew up in--sorry, that's where he was born.  The family moved from Wybark to Kansas City, Kansas, which is where he grew up.  He and his brothers grew up in Kansas City, Kansas.
Speaker 1: Now, is there a, a, any story about another origin for the family prior to Wybark?
Speaker 2: Yes.  From what I understand, my great-grandfather was--or it might have been great-great--was a Buffalo Soldier.  And had come through the South, migrating west through Louisiana then further north and somehow ended up in Oklahoma after riding with the Buffalo Soldiers in, during that time, married a, an Indian [Native American] woman.  And had a daughter who was my grandmother, Beulah [Gertrude Jordan], and she married a man by the name of James Jordan.  And I don't know his origin, much about him, he died when I was a boy.
Story_ID: 608233
Speaker 1: That's quite a story on that side of the family (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.  But my father [Robert H. Jordan, Sr.] tells a more interesting story--
Speaker 1: (Cough) Okay.
Speaker 2: --that, he said, during the Depression [Great Depression], his father [James Jordan] had a job.  He said, the most--and that job had the most profound effect upon the family.  Because we're talking about a time in the late 1920s when everyone was out of work.  Whites were out of work, so you know most blacks were out of work.  But here is a black man who had a job.  His job, by the way, was sweeping out buses and vehicles that the city owned.  It paid pennies but it was a job.  And that was enough to give the family a slight leg up because during this time of extreme poverty all over the country for someone to be working was amazing.  And, even though you're only bringing home pennies virtually, it's enough to keep the family fed, keep you buying clothes, put, you know, a little here and there.  And my dad, who was the oldest of these five boys, was able to always find a job.  Whether it was--and this is later on--to--he would a get a job and they would pass down jobs from one boy to the next.  And my father, in talking with some of his friends, was kind of a hustler.  He's a very handsome man who had kind of star-like qualities, very likable, very affable, but--shot pool, was a whiz and heard of him playing dice games and that sort of thing.
Story_ID: 608234
Speaker 1: So they were--he [Jordan's father, Robert H. Jordan, Sr.] was able to hustle his way around and put some money together.  Went to the University of Kansas [Lawrence, Kansas] and majored in education, came out, went to Pine Bluff, Arkansas to Arkansas State [sic.] where he met my mother [Millicent Dobbs Jordan], who as teaching there at the same time.  And that's where they met.
Speaker 2: That's the University of Arkansas Pine Bluff [Arkansas Agricultural, Mechanical and Normal College; University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff, Pine Bluff, Arkansas]?
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Okay. He, he went to the University of Kansas, now, was that unusual in those days for a black student to attend (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) It was unusual for him and he worked in, worked in sorority houses, he worked the whole time.  He put himself through school, working at the same time that--because he didn't have any money, I mean, his father [James Jordan] couldn't pay his way through school so he hustled and, as he describes it, hustled his way through sc- through college.  And, got out, and I don't know how he ended up in Pine Bluff, Arkansas but, sure enough, that's where he was, that's where he met my mother and they got married, had me.  He went off to the [U.S.] Army.
Speaker 2: Okay, so he met your mother at--
Speaker 1: At Pine Bluff, Arkansas.
Speaker 2: Now, what was your mother--was she teaching there?
Speaker 1: My mother was teaching, she had gotten her master's [degree] from Columbia University [New York, New York] and had come back and somehow heard about a position being open there and--at Arkansas State.  And so, she and my dad met on campus.  And that's where they met, fell in love and married.
Speaker 2: And this would be in nineteen for- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) This was probably in 1941, yeah.  I was born in '43 [1943].
Story_ID: 608235
Speaker 1: Let's see, when you think about your parents' talents and dispositions and, you know, personalities, who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: Well, if you ask my wife [Sharon Lundy Jordan], she'll tell you that I'm a lot like my mother.  But the older I get I think I'm a lot like my father [Robert H. Jordan, Sr.].  And, I see a lot of them coming out in different ways.  My mother would not be ashamed to correct you if you made a grammatical mistake.  And, I was at dinner--we were at dinner the other night, (laughter) a month or so ago, and someone made a statement, I can't remember what it was now, and I corrected them.  And my wife kicked me under the table, and later she said, "You know, I saw Millie [Millicent Dobbs Jordan] coming out of you."  Because everybody called her Millie.  And we both laughed because I remembered, I said, "Yeah, you're right," because that's what mama would do.  If we said anything wrong, she'd correct you.  Stop you right there, and correct you.  And, but I feel if--you don't want someone walking around--and she's done the same thing now, I mean, with--in instances where she's heard someone.  So, as--my mother taught my wife too by the way at Spelman [Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia].  And my daughter went to Spelman so, my daughter, Karen [Karen Jordan], is a third generation.  But, at any rate, my father was more, more stoic.  He used to say it was the Indian [Native American] in him (laughter) but, he, among his friends, he was very outgoing and laughable.  But I used to see a very, sometimes melancholy side to him that, that others didn't see.  And, but my mother was, was much more outgoing than my father.  And I think I'm probably a mixture of them both.
Story_ID: 608236
Speaker 1: You were born in Atlanta [Georgia], right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: My earliest childhood memories are of the time when I was living in John Wesley Dobbs' house while my father [Robert H. Jordan, Sr.]--and I find that very difficult to believe because I had to be under the age of five and four, but I remember things like being afraid of the tuba when the kid from the marching band would go home with it in the afternoon and he'd walk down the street playing the tuba.  I later played the French horn.  But, I remember being with my [maternal] grandfather, of course, that also occurred later in life so I could be confusing those.  My earliest memories are of those times when before and after we moved to Nashville [Tennessee] and would come back to Atlanta to visit.  Happy times.
Story_ID: 608237
Speaker 1: Well, we always ask the question--
Speaker 2: Right (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) like this. What were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Some of the smells I have are of those wonderful dinners in my [maternal] grandfather's home [John Wesley Dobbs], cooking of fish, cooking chitlins, chicken, the aromas of the house at my grandfather's house.  My mother preparing chili at home, which later became known as Millie's [Millicent Dobbs Jordan] chili, which she became very well known in the family for.  Laughter, music all the time, music.  My mother played the piano, and there was always music in the home.  I can still hear (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You mean live music?
Speaker 2: Live music and recorded music, my Aunt June [HistoryMaker June Dobbs Butts] and Mattiwilda [HistoryMaker Mattiwilda Dobbs Janzon], as I was saying, I was kind of like the little live doll that they had to play with.  As I was learning to speak, one of the first things they say is that I would recognize that's Rachmaninoff [Sergei Rachmaninoff].  And they would play different records and symphonies and piano concerti and so forth, and I could recognize them.  And, of course, as my aunt began to sing more and more, I would vocalize with her because as a kid, you know, you have the real high voice.  And so here she is a soprano and I'm (makes sound), I, of course, can't do it now but then, you know, I could go as high as she could, you know.  And so, so music, all the time music and music has always been a big part of my life.  Music and, and sounds, a home full of sounds and laughter.
Story_ID: 608238
Speaker 1: Was church a big part of growing up?
Speaker 2: Church was a big part of growing up.  First Congressional Church [First Congregational Church of Atlanta, United Church of Christ, Atlanta, Georgia] was where I grew up, and my [maternal] grandfather [John Wesley Dobbs] was a deacon there in the church.  And my mother [Millicent Dobbs Jordan] was not as devout as my father [Robert H. Jordan, Sr.] was and--but even when we moved to Nashville [Tennessee] those were years when I didn't--I went to church, a little community church in the neighborhood where we lived but kind of stopped for a while.  And then after I got married to my wife [Sharon Lundy Jordan], whose family has some very deep church roots, she kind of brought me back in.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, now did you--did the church provide like leadership roles for you growing up and that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: It did because, you know, I went to convocation classes and, you know, I kind of thought my way out of the church.  You know, you can't think too much and I think thinking is the greatest enemy of religion.  Because when you question, you begin to--when you question without answers, then that I think has caused people historically to fall out of, out of the church.  And I have always felt that thinkers are the biggest questioners of organized religion.  Doesn't mean that you can't be faithful and devout in your internal feelings towards a higher power or a divine being, or whatever.  But organized religions somehow come into question I think for people who are sort of existential thinkers, who begin to question the whys.
Speaker 1: Did you start thinking about the--
Speaker 2: I think I always have.  From the first time I heard the story of the parting of the sea and, you know, you start thinking, well, you know, should I believe in the Bible word from word?  You know, what do I do here, how do I question all of these miracles that you hear about?  And so, here again I say, people who think and who question many times can think themselves right out of it, right out of the church.
Story_ID: 608239
Speaker 1: I was asking you about the church [First Congregational Church of Atlanta, United Church of Christ, Atlanta, Georgia] and basically you were saying it's influence was minimal I guess in some ways.  It was there but it wasn't over--
Speaker 2: I think that came--the influence of the church was not important to my mother [Millicent Dobbs Jordan].  She even has said that she was an atheist, but believed to some degree in an order that must have, must be in place somewhere.  And, but as I was saying before, I think that people can allow themselves to think themselves out of the church by questioning too much.  Because, when you think about what religion is, basically an effort to ask you to have blind faith.  Blind faith that there is this creator or that religion or this, and if you don't have blind faith then you question religion, you question that authority.  And it makes it difficult to say specifically that this what I believe in even though you may to some degree have that uncertainty because we all have that uncertainty.  Just like we don't know for sure what happens after death any more than we know what happened before birth.  So there is that part of this whole life cycle that we will never fully understand, not while we're here.  So, unless you have that blind faith which I have often heard is an effort on the part of mankind to explain what happens after death, and an ability on man's part to accept the finality of death.  Because if you do that, it can be frightening for some people.  And so the way around that is to say that there is life after death, there is something going on after here upon which most religions are based.  The teaching, the carrot at the end of the stick is you live well in this life, something good's going to happen afterwards.  And the religions are based around that.  I have no problem with that--those tenants of that philosophy.  I adhere to those tenants of, of trying to live as good and moral a life as you can while you're here, because I believe that, that we can derive a great deal of satisfaction from helping others, from doing good for others.  And that's the way I've tried to live my life, and I even take it to another level and I believe that each--I believe that one person can make a difference.  Luckily, as a, as a reporter all these years, I've seen instances of that.  I've done stories on people who have stood up when no one else would, who have stepped forward when no one else would, and who have made the effort when no one else would to do something.  And have, as a result of that, inspired others, turned around communities, helped thousands of people, one person.  So I truly believe that one person can make a difference.  And I've seen it happen over and over and over again.  And so I've tried to live by that as well to make a difference in other people's lives and I think that, that's a good way to live.  And so I'm happy and confident with that.
Story_ID: 608240
Speaker 1: I hear you saying that, that I guess the moral instruction that you received growing up was, you know, from the church [First Congregational Church of Atlanta, United Church of Christ, Atlanta, Georgia] but was also from, from your mother's [Millicent Dobbs Jordan] intellectual activities and other--and the activities of other people around you.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.  Now, there, there was religion in my home as with my [maternal] grandfather [John Wesley Dobbs] and all of his, all of his children.  My mother and, and some of her sisters in varying degrees were involved in the church, some less than others, some more than others.  But, my father [Robert H. Jordan, Sr.] had a strong church background and would go to church even without my mother.  And always kept--we were always members of a church community and there were always the family, the social activities that went along with being members of a church.  I was baptized and went through the instructions and all of that.  And so, there is--I am imbued with the foundations of Christian life.  I cannot escape that, that is a part of my childhood and my upbringing.  And so I don't try to fight and escape it, I don't chase it either.  I have set standards that I have set for myself, as I said, trying to live a good and wholesome and productive life helping others as much as I can.  And so I believe with that in mind I am comfortable with my life as I live it and I don't try to proselytize my way of thinking on anyone else because I'm maybe unique in what I believe, and I don't know maybe there are hundreds of--millions of other people who feel the same way.
Story_ID: 608241
Speaker 1: Let me ask you this.  Now, you're a good-size fellow, you know, were sports important growing up?
Speaker 2: Sports were always a part of my life, I was always active.  And started out as a kid riding bicycles and running and then later in basketball, did a little boxing until I got--caught a couple of right crosses to the jaw and realized I had a glass jaw and said this isn't for me.  (Laughter) And just stuck to basketball, but I caught elbows in the jaw, but that was better.  Then later in life more track and field sorts of sports and then into my forties triathlons.  I would swim and bike and run, and I continued to do that.
Speaker 1: Well that's, that's really strenuous activity.
Speaker 2: So I, I have a gym right upstairs in the house right now where I still go in and workout and pump a little iron and I'll show you some of the pictures upstairs.
Speaker 1: So were you a high school athlete, I mean, did you, you were on the teams and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah. Walt Frazier, who played with the Knicks [New York Knicks], and I were on the same high school basketball team together.  We went on and we were All-City when I was there.
Speaker 1: What high school is it?
Speaker 2: This was David T. Howard High School in Atlanta [Georgia].  I transferred my junior year and ended up graduating from H.M. Turner High School [Henry McNeal Turner High School] in Atlanta.  But, for my first two years of high school at, at Howard, David T. Howard, I played on the varsity basketball team.  As I said, Walt Frazier was one of my teammates.
Speaker 1: Yeah, the great Walt Frazier was--
Speaker 2: Clyde.
Speaker 1: Yeah, on the National Basketball Association Hall of Fame [Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, Springfield, Massachusetts].
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Story_ID: 608242
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Let me go back to grade school.  Now, we didn't establish where you went to grade school.  Now, where did you go to grade school?
Speaker 2: When my father [Robert H. Jordan, Sr.] got out of the [U.S.] Army in 1945, '46 [1946], we moved from Atlanta [Georgia] to Nashville, Tennessee.  Both my parents taught at Tennessee State University [Tennessee Agricultural and Industrial State University; Tennessee State University, Nashville, Tennessee].  My father taught biology and science and my mother [Millicent Dobbs Jordan] taught speech and drama.
Speaker 1: (TAPE INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Speed.
Speaker 1: When my father got out of the Army in 1945 or '46 [1946], we left Atlanta and moved to Nashville, Tennessee where both my parents taught at Tennessee State University.  And my father taught science and biology, my mother taught English, speech and drama.  My father taught for a number of years and eventually decided that he wanted to be his own boss, so he left teaching and enrolled in a dental school in Meharry Medical College [Nashville, Tennessee].  Again, my mother continued to teach.  By that time, I had spent the first elementary school years at Ford Greene school [Ford Greene Elementary School], G-R-E-E-N, school in Nashville [Tennessee].
Speaker 2: Now, is that the like the lab school for Tennessee State or was--
Speaker 1: No, by the time, by the time I reached my first grade, we had moved a little away from the school, bicycle ride away from the campus.
Story_ID: 608243
Speaker 1: My dad [Robert H. Jordan, Sr.] had already, as I said, begun to enroll in dental school [Meharry Medical College, Nashville, Tennessee].  And, by the time he graduated, I was twelve.  So, we moved back to Atlanta [Georgia] and--
Speaker 2: So this is like seventh grade I guess?
Speaker 1: That's right.  Middle school, yeah, sixth and seventh grade.  Because I began my eighth grade at David T. Howard [David T. Howard High School, Atlanta, Georgia].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And my middle school then was Nathan B. Forrest [Nathan B. Forrest Elementary School, Atlanta, Georgia].
Speaker 2: Nathan B. Forrest.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was a confederate general (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Nathan Bedford Forrest, the founder of the Ku Klux Klan [KKK].
Speaker 1: That's right, and I went to a school named after him.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so this school, did it sort of end up inadvertently in a black community?
Speaker 1: You got that right, very good on your history.  Changing neighborhoods in Atlanta at the time, when we moved back to Atlanta, where we moved had previously been an all-white neighborhood.  And this was the beginning of changing neighborhoods at that time, and so I end up going to Nathan B. Forrest middle school or junior high, as they called them then.  Nathan B. Forrest, named after the Confederate general, and as you said, the--
Speaker 2: Founder (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) founder of the Ku Klux Klan.
Story_ID: 608244
Speaker 1: But then graduated and went right into David T. Howard [David T. Howard High School, Atlanta, Georgia].
Speaker 2: Okay. Now--
Speaker 1: Which, by the way, was right across the street from my [maternal] grandfather's [John Wesley Dobbs] house where I had--where I was born, spent my early years, and where the guy with the tuba had been walking down the street terrifying me (laughter) as a child, as a baby.  But, by then, I had been playing the trumpet--started playing the trumpet in the si- in the first grade actually.  So, by the time, I got to high school I was pretty proficient and had given some concerts around and things like that.  My mother [Millicent Dobbs Jordan] had wanted me to--I had taken piano lessons beginning at age six, as each of her sisters--as she and each of her sisters had done.  I didn't like the piano, I hated the piano, I'd cry before every class.  And I wish that they had made me stay with it, but they let me stop because I said, "Okay, well, can I pick up an instrument?"  So I picked up the trumpet and then, when I got to high school, there wasn't a position in the marching band that was open but there was one for a French horn.  So I made the switch from trumpet to French horn and fell in love with the French horn, and just continued that throughout high school.  And eventually I was first chair, French horn and kept that up.
Speaker 2: Yeah, usually the French horn player in high school is--he gets a lot of attention 'cause, you know, it's a hard, harder instrument to play.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it is, very difficult and takes a particular embrasure and that those days I was playing an instrument that had been knocked and beat the hell, and all dent up.  So it was really tough to get a decent sound out of it, and the fact that I could I think probably says a lot about how well I could play.  And, but I enjoyed it, I liked it.  And even tried to go back to it about fifteen years ago, but I'd lost it all.
Story_ID: 608245
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, so you were a French horn player in high school, basketball player (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 1: --started on a team with Walt Frazier.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Now, you have to tell us about that experience before I ask about the academic side, but what was that like (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay, basketball I loved.  My father [Robert H. Jordan, Sr.] had been a basketball player.  And as part of his--during his hustling days, basketball was a part of that too so he was very athletic, he and all of his, his four brothers.  So I would go to the Y [Young Men's Christian Association] then we'd play on weekends.  And Walt would run along, we'd--he didn't live to far from me and he was one of my buddies.  And so we had a good team.  During those days, the tallest man on our team was a guy who was about 6'7", and he was the center, 6'7".  That was tall.  So, but we were good.  And Clyde could shoot, I could shoot, and we were fast and we were All-City.
Speaker 1: Now, Walt Frazier was like 6'4", right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we're about the same height.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.
Speaker 2: Six-three and a half, 6'4".  He's 6'4" so we're about the same height.
Speaker 1: Now, did, did you guys play guard?
Speaker 2: Yep, we both did forward.
Speaker 1: Okay, forward?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, 'cause I was gonna say that in those days that'd been pretty tall set of guards.
Speaker 2: Right, yeah, we were forwards.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, so we played around.  I, my first year was on the B string I wasn't--he was first string and I was not.  And, but I made, made the varsity my--would be my sophomore year.  And got to play a little more, and of course as I said, he was first string and played all the time.  He was good.  And I got better and better, and by the time I transferred to Turner High [Henry McNeal Turner High School, Atlanta, Georgia] my junior and senior year, I was varsity from on both of those years.
Speaker 1: Now, you said you all won the city championship? When you were there? Your (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm, that would have been my sophomore year at Howard [David T. Howard High School, Atlanta, Georgia].
Story_ID: 608246
Speaker 1: Then, my parents--my father [Robert H. Jordan, Sr.] was practicing then so we built a home in Atlanta [Georgia] out in the suburbs, out in a wooded area outside the city.  Now, just like in all cities, the city has grown way beyond where that home was then.
Speaker 2: What was the suburb called then?
Speaker 1: It was called Collier Heights in Atlanta.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And built a home up on a hill with a driveway that curved around to get you up to the house.  And, my mother [Millicent Dobbs Jordan], I remember picking out the lot.  We'd go out every Sunday and driving around and my parents found this, this double-lotted area and they bought it and later built a home up on top of that hill, still there to this day.  And it was beautiful, ranch-style home.  But on the top of the hill there was a huge backyard that ran for another whole lot.  And since the driveway curved around between the trees to get up to the top, then my father built this huge asphalt turn-around behind the house which the size of a half of a basketball court.  So, naturally, put a basketball (laughter)--
Speaker 2: Stand there in the yard--
Speaker 1: Yeah--stand right there in the yard.  Guys would come over and on weekends we'd have so many guys.  We'd have fifty, sixty guys in my backyard on a weekend.  Cars would be parked on the street, on the street behind the house, all over.  Running in and out of the house so much my mother had my father install a water fountain outside the house because people were just running in the house all day on Saturday and Sunday.  So, we'd have great games, we'd start early Saturday morning and we'd play all day long.  And these were great games.  And, since it was half court, we could get a five-man game going out there.  And it was good, it was good basketball.  A good sandlot basketball, so that's, that's where I really developed my talent was out there.  That's where, you know, you learn it, you know, it out playing on, on the courts like that, you know.  That's where you learn because you're catching elbows and you're getting' pushed and there are no referees out there so it's, that's, that's sweet basketball there though.
Story_ID: 608247
Speaker 1: Now, what was your favorite academic subject in school?
Speaker 2: I always liked the sciences.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I think that came from my father [Robert H. Jordan, Sr.] because I would go up even during the time when he taught at Tennessee State [Tennessee Agricultural and Industrial State University; Tennessee State University, Nashville, Tennessee], I would go up to his classroom with him and sit in on his courses in biology and the sciences.  I'd go with him when they'd go out and catch specimens for the, the aquariums and so forth that they had in the biology department.  They'd go on snake hunts, and I'd go with him when they'd catch snakes and so I didn't have a fear of snakes or animals or anything like that and loved biology.  So I thought that maybe I wanted to go into medicine, wanted to be a doctor.  And that's why when I sort of continued to take a lot of the science courses, but I was weak in math.  And somewhere along the line I didn't get a good foundation in math and that followed me and it crippled me.  I had--the best math course I had was geometry, I had a great teacher and I loved it, and I was good in it.  But my other instructors in math growing up weren't that good and it really crippled me and I suffered from it later on.  But the sciences, because I guess I had that extra interest and incentive to learn, I did so and it came naturally to me.  So the biology I did well.  So when I got to college, when I got to Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia], I was doing well in the sciences but chemistry was kicking my butt--
Speaker 1: Okay so (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) because of the math.
Story_ID: 608248
Speaker 1: So you graduated from Turner High School [Henry McNeal Turner High School, Atlanta, Georgia] then (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 1: --in '61 [1961]?
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Okay. All right.
Speaker 2: But I'll backup, I'll tell you an interesting story.  In the marching band, we used to go to Fort Valley, Georgia every year for a big band concert.  And there would be marching bands from all over the state and they would convene in Fort Valley, Georgia for a day of marching and we'd have our concert season there as well.  But we--the big triple-A school, the triple-A schools in Atlanta [Georgia] would march through first and then the smaller schools would follow.  And I remember my junior year, we'd already marched into an area there in Fort Valley and I walked back out to watch some of the other schools come by.  And I saw this majorette.  I looked at this woman when she walked by and I thought, ah, be still my heart.
Speaker 1: (Cough).
Speaker 2: Yeah, I know, man. It's nothing worse than that. So, let me back up.  The marching bands would go to Fort Valley, Georgia in the spring for our concert season and to march. (Background noise) And I remember seeing the--(laughter) let me go back once more.
Speaker 1: (TAPE INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  And speed.
Speaker 1: When I was in high school, the marching bands would have a big convocation each spring and they'd meet in Fort Valley, Georgia, which is in central Georgia outside Macon [Georgia].  We'd have our concert season there and then we'd watch the other bands as they'd march around.  I walked out to watch some of the other Georgia high schools walk by and I saw this majorette.  This girl went marching by and I looked and I couldn't believe my eyes.  If there is such a thing as love at first sight, it happened.  I became haunted by this woman.  Because I walked along the sidewalk following them just looking at her.  And, finally, they marched on out of sight, I never saw her again.  But her image was burned in my mind and I never forgot it.  At least I thought I hadn't forgotten it.  So, anyway, two years later I graduate from Turner High School, I go to Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia] and with my buddies we would always go over and hang out at Spelman [Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia], the women's institution right across the street.  So, I'm over there and we're kind of sitting on the railing watching all the girls walk by, heading to the cafeteria in the afternoon.  Who should walk by but the majorette that I had seen two years earlier.  I didn't know it, but something in my subconscious knew it.  Because I saw her and again I was thunderstruck, and I kind of (makes sound), she just kind of looked at me and walked on by and ignored me.  But I went after her and I, you know, kept finding--had to find out "Who, who is that?"  Said, "That's Sharon Lundy [Sharon Lundy Jordan]."  "Sharon Lundy, huh?  Man!" So I tracked her down.  Come to find out, she was in one of my mother's [Millicent Dobbs Jordan] classes.  And in a few--I didn't get to catch up with her until a few months later and a few girlfriends later (laughter) but I eventually did.  Found out that she was from Waycross, Georgia.  I remembered it was Center High [Center High School, Waycross, Georgia] when they came marching by and sure enough that was Sharon that I had seen marching by two years earlier and who had haunted me for all that time, the mystery woman.  And we ended up dating for a number of years and a long time, and eventually got married.  And we've been married now thirty-seven years.
Speaker 2: That's quite a story.
Speaker 1: Yeah (laughter).
Speaker 2: Okay, Waycross, Georgia, that's where [HistoryMaker] Ossie Davis is from.
Speaker 1: That's right, he sure is.  Very good.
Story_ID: 608249
Speaker 1: Well when you were on the verge of high school [Henry McNeal Turner High School, Atlanta, Georgia] graduation, what did you envision your prospects to be? What did you think you wanted to be?
Speaker 2: When I was in high school I, by that time, I really intended to go into medicine, wanted to be a doctor so I took all of the physics and chemistry, and the science classes that I needed so that I could qualify to get me down the road.  But, as I said, I was so crippled in math that it was gonna be a problem for me.  Not only that, but my freshman year at Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia], all of my friends who were there with me were in political science.  I was the only guy in a pre-med regiment of classes.  They didn't have any labs; they were basically done.  I had all these labs in the afternoon, but then it was time to go hang out on the corner, go watch the girls.  It was either go hang out on the corner and watch the girls or go to lab.  I'd go hang out on the corner with the boys (laughter) and eventually my grades started to suffer.  My father [Robert H. Jordan, Sr.] kept telling me, "Boy, keep those grades up."  I do fine in biology, I do fine in all the other courses but the chemistry and the physics where I needed that math was kicking my butt.  So, eventually, my grades were not doing well and I really wasn't concentrating as well.  And, if you didn't keep a C+ average to maintain a deferment, you could get drafted into the Vietnam War, which was going on during that time.  One semester allowed my grades to fall below a C+ and (snaps) like that, I was drafted.  And so--
Speaker 1: So what year is this?
Speaker 2: Nineteen sixty-six [1966].
Speaker 1: Sixty-six [1966].
Speaker 2: No.  Yeah, around 1965.  And so, I had allowed my grades to fall to that point.  So, when you're drafted back then, you were drafted for two years, but if you what they call re-upped or decided to enlist for another year, for a total of three years, then you could pick and choose the school that you wanted to go to.  Well, I thought, you know, if I as a draftee, I'm gonna be carrying a rifle in Vietnam.  If I re-enlist for a year, I can pick a school so I chose to do that and enlist in the operating room school, which knowing that I wanted to go into medicine down the road, would give me an opportunity to get some real good experience.  So, I re-upped for a year, six months of which were spent in Fort Sam Houston [San Antonio, Texas] in the O.R. [operating room] school and in in OJT [on the job training].  And then got sent to San Juan, Puerto Rico (laughter) as opposed to Vietnam.
Story_ID: 608250
Speaker 1: You're in- assigned to Puerto Rico now.  This is about 1967 now, we're talking about?
Speaker 2: Right, when I, when I got out of OJT [on the job training] in Atlanta [Georgia] I got my orders, most of the guys were either getting Vietnam or other places.  And I got sent to San Juan, Puerto Rico.  I couldn't believe it.  My best friend, who had gone in with me, was sent of course to Vietnam.  I would get letters from him, they'd have mud all over them from when he was in during the monsoons.  And, of course, I'd send him letters with pictures postcards in there with me on the beach, with the little glass with an umbrella in it.  He hated it.  But, I was there for two years, worked in a military hospital and was still trying to prepare myself for what I thought would be a career in medicine.  So, we scrubbed all the cases for the support personnel from all the--there's a huge naval base there in San Juan [Roosevelt Roads Naval Station, Ceiba, Puerto Rico] and so we got a lot of the sailors and their wives.  We also got Puerto Rican soldiers who were coming back to San Juan to be treated for wounds and injuries they suffered and for which they had been initially treated overseas, and now they were getting their subsequent care.  So we did all of that, plus VA members [Veterans Administration; U.S. Department of Veterans Affiars] as well.  You need to get that?
Speaker 1: (TAPE INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Speed.
Speaker 1: So after, after I spent the two years in Puerto Rico, I also worked at night while I was there in a civilian hospital to make extra money.
Story_ID: 608251
Speaker 1: So when I left there I got sent to Fort Bragg in North Carolina and I got put into a MASH [mobile army surgical hospital] unit, which is a mobile hospital, and we set that up and got it ready to go.  And, as Tet [Tet Offensive] was about to set in, they were preparing this hospital to be shipped over during that time.  But I was able to get an early out to go back to college.  And so, went back to Nashville, Tennessee and enrolled in Fisk [Fisk University].  And so I was in Fisk for about a year and a half, still trying to complete my college work when I needed a summer job.  And I worked at Meharry [Meharry Medical College, Nashville, Tennessee] at night in the OR [operating room], and the doctors there thought that I, you know, I was just great. Because I knew all of these techniques I had learned in the [U.S.] Army, which were cutting-edge techniques that physicians coming back from Vietnam were showing everyone on how to treat mass casualties and so forth.  And I'm right in there scrubbing in the OR with them and so I knew all of that.  So the doctors who were at Meharry wanted me to go, they were even willing at that point to give me an early admission in scholarship to Meharry.  I had most of my college work completed but not all of it.  But they had seen me work and in the OR, and they knew.
Story_ID: 608252
Speaker 1: Of course, my dad [Robert H. Jordan, Sr.] wanted me to go into Meharry [Meharry Medical College, Nashville, Tennessee], his old school.  But, I still was having second thoughts about it, and so in the summertime of 1970, I got a job at a television station.  And, it was working in the booth, which is the announcer's booth, at the top of the hour and the bottom of the hour where I had to do station identifications.  It was at WSM television [WSM-TV; WSMV-TV, Nashville, Tennessee].  And so I would say, "This is WSM television, the broadcasting service of the National Life and Accident Insurance Company, Nashville, Tennessee."  And my wife, Sharon [Sharon Lundy Jordan], would tune in at the top of the hour just to listen to me say that (laughter). And so, but then I started doing more and more, working on a morning show and even doing a little weather and sports.  And, and started working with a guy in radio.  He was teaching me how to write newsreel style, and I started liking it.  Before that I had thought that I couldn't write, I really thought I could not write.  I had, I had papers returned to me in college that had more red lines through them than a roadmap.  And so I really felt like I couldn't write.  But I just didn't know, I hadn't had an opportunity.  So, to make a long story short, I decided to stay with that television, give it another year.  And after a year, I, I told the doctors at Meharry, "You know, I'm gonna stay with this television stuff for a year and make a decision after a year."  By then I had started to get offers from little television stations around in Nashville and--I mean, in and around Tennessee and surrounding communities and areas.  And I asked the general manager of my station, "What do you really think my career in broadcasting could be?"  And I said, "Please be honest with me."  And I liked this guy and I knew that he had my good interests at heart.  And he said that he thought that I had a, probably a very bright career ahead of me.  So, I made my decision to stay with it. And was learning to write more and more, I was blending into news out of programming and more into news while I was working at that station.  And I began to like it more and more.
Story_ID: 608253
Speaker 1: And got an offer in 1973 to come to Chicago [Illinois].  Oh, I forgot.  Once I got that job, I had a little money for the first time in my life so I proposed to Sharon [Sharon Lundy Jordan] and she accepted, and we got married in December of 1970.  And so she moved to Nashville [Tennessee] with me, we had a little tiny apartment.  A little two-bedroom apartment and we had fun.  And my daughter was born, Karen [Karen Jordan] was born about a year and a half later.  And--no, about three years later, because she was six months when I moved to Chicago in 1973.  So, we moved here and life took lots of different turns from that point on.
Story_ID: 608254
Speaker 1: Now did you have a lot of offers to choose from when you got the offer from Chicago [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Not really.  I had started sending out tapes at that point.  I had tried to go to Miami [Florida], I had tried to go back to Atlanta [Georgia].  But there were never openings available when I was ready to go, and so nothing quite worked at that time.  Miami was offering about the same thing I was making in Nashville [Tennessee] and I didn't see moving from Nashville to a much larger market like Miami and make the same thing.  So I turned that offer down and it wasn't until I got the offer to come to Chicago that we decided to--they flew me up here and I drove around and looked at the city and I thought Chicago.  Man!  This was not on my mind.  But, we made the move and came here in March of 1973 and moved in an apartment on the Near North Side [Chicago, Illinois] of the city not too far from the station, and began our new life here.
Speaker 1: Now, this is with WGN [WGN-TV, Chicago, Illinois], right?
Speaker 2: That's correct.
Speaker 1: Tribune's--
Speaker 2: Right.  WGN stands for World's Greatest Newspaper, owned by the Chicago Tribune.  And, let me try that again.  WGN stands for World's Greatest Newspaper being owned by the Chicago Tribune.  One of the original television stations dating way back sixty years.  And the radio station [WGN Radio, Chicago, Illinois] was one of the first clear channel 50,000-watt radio stations.
Speaker 1: Get it all over the Midwest.
Speaker 2: Everywhere.  Now, it and WLS [WLS Radio, Chicago, Illinois], which I used to listen to in Nashville, Randy's Record Mart.  And, (laughter) anyway, so we moved to Chicago and didn't know a soul.  Sharon [Sharon Lundy Jordan] did have an uncle who was here at the time, who was still alive, but other than that we didn't know a soul here.  And we moved here with Karen [Karen Jordan] and got an apartment on the Near North Side of town, not too far from the station and we began our life here.  I stayed at WGN for about three years, maybe four and left.
Story_ID: 608255
Speaker 1: Who was on the news team at WGN [WGN-TV, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Oh, okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Who was the anchor?
Speaker 2: You know, I really should back up.  I'm forgetting, when I started working at that television station in Nashville [Tennessee], I was the first on-air black person on that staff.  And this was in Nashville, Tennessee in the South.  I can remember going to Belle Meade Country Club [Nashville, Tennessee] where my father [Robert H. Jordan, Sr.] had worked as a waiter during the time that he put himself through dental school [Meharry Medical College, Nashville, Tennessee].  He worked--he waited tables at night, made good tips in this very wealthy, ritzy country club, Belle Meade Country Club in Nashville.  But I remember him telling me that they all had to come in through the back door, through the kitchen to come to work.  Well, we drive up there to do a golf tournament and I'm working there at WSM [WSM-TV; WSMV-TV, Nashville, Tennessee] at the time.  Of course, I walked right in through the front door, something my father could not have done years earlier.  And when I walked into the dining room, there were still no black members of the country club, no blacks, no Jews even to that point.  This was in 1970.  And I'm standing in this, in this--in the dining room of this country club doing an interview and I happen to look over towards the kitchen and I saw these heads, (makes sound), poking out of the kitchen door, looking into the dining room. There were all these black people peering out the door looking at me standing in the dining room of the Belle Meade Country Club without a white jacket on.  And, I remember going home and telling my--calling my father and saying, "Guess where I was today?"  And, by now, he's a very successful dentist in Atlanta [Georgia].  Said, "Well, where?"  I said, "I was in the Belle Meade Country Club."  He said, "What?"  I said, "Yep," said, "I was standing in the dining room," I described to him where I was and said, "I'm sure a place where you spent many a long night working."  And I walked in through the front door and I told him about the people sticking their heads out through the kitchen door to see me there.  And it was just--and it was a milestone realizing that I was able to do something that my father hadn't done or been able to do.  And so, I've seen a lot of those throughout my broadcast career.  In Nashville there were many, being the first black on the air in Nashville I was going into places, as I began to do more and more news, where, you know, walking through front doors.  I mean, this is a time of--segregation has, has broken down in the South for the most part, but it's still de facto and it's still there.
Story_ID: 608256
Speaker 1: Now, were you in Atlanta [Georgia] when Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was killed?
Speaker 2: No, I was in the [U.S.] Army.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's what I thought.
Speaker 2: I was in the Army during that time.  But I would hear the stories of, you know, the riots and being outside the country.  Even in Puerto Rico we're getting the news late, we're getting the newspapers late and there was no CNN.  So, there were only local island television stations, and so the reports and things were coming in late.  And so we didn't get the magnitude, the gravity of what was going on until days after it had already occurred.  But, you could still tell that hell was breaking out here in the United States.  And I wanted to be here, I wanted to see it, I wanted to experience it, and I wanted to taste the fear that I'm sure everyone felt during that time here in this country.  Because, even being there, you could sense that it was an awfully frightening time when the riots were breaking out and when there was so much unrest and uncertainty.
Story_ID: 608257
Speaker 1: So, the years at WSM [WSM-TV; WSMV-TV, Nashville, Tennessee] were very interesting years.  The television station owned the Grand Ole Opry [Nashville, Tennessee], so on my television show in the morning, the show on which I worked, were all the top country music stars.  From Johnny Cash and Porter Wagoner and Dolly Parton, and Flatt [Lester Flatt] and Scruggs [Earl Scruggs], and you name every big star of the Grand Ole Opry was on our show.  And they all new me because I'm on the air on the Grand Ole Opry station.  So, I, I didn't know anything about country music, and (laughter)--but I learned it being at that TV station.  That's what they were (singing) playing every morning.  And so I'd listen to it and I got to know some of the songs more and more, and some of it I kind a liked.  And nowadays, you know--and when Ray Charles did his country album and there was a big blending that took place later on.  And, but when I started there, I didn't know country music at all.  I mean, it was something that as you turned the radio you went right by in a hurry, you didn't stop.  But, you know, now there's, there's some great artists out there and some great country songs, and I like it all.  I love all kinds of music, and so, yeah, I developed an appreciation for it while I was there in Nashville [Tennessee].
Story_ID: 608258
Speaker 1: So, in Chicago [Illinois] at WGN [WGN-TV], now, now, who is the--what was the news staff?  I know WGN is kind of famous for its news (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Uh-huh.  When, when I came to WGN that was 1973, it was still film.  So, I get interns now and they ask me what it was like to go live when I started at WGN, and I tell them, "We couldn't go live."  And they go, "You couldn't?"  I say, "No, it was film."  "Well, why couldn't you go live?" (Laughter) I say, "Because film has to be processed, developed, you know, it's not electronic."  And so, you know, kids today don't even understand that, so I have to explain to them what, what it was like then.  But it was film, and covering news was, was what I was doing full-time then, no programming, it was all news.  And, I enjoyed it.  We were number four in a five station market because the other stations were all owned and operated stations by the network.  CBS, NBC and Channel 7 [WLS-TV, Chicago, Illinois] were--and ABC were all owned by the networks and they threw money at them and they--where they had four-man crews and we had a two-man crew.  They had--I mean it was just a bigger emphasis there, so our numbers showed it.  Interestingly enough, I'll just give you an example.  When I came here, the number one station was Channel 2 [WBBM-TV, Chicago, Illinois], CBS with Bill and Walter.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Bill Kurtis and Walter--
Speaker 2: Bill Kurtis and Walter Jacobson.  Their numbers then were in the seventies and eighties, our numbers at WGN were the forties and fifties.  Today, the number one station is WLS-ABC, Channel 7.  Their number one numbers on a good night, they'll do twelves to fifteens.  And we'll do--that's in the second place now, maybe sevens and eights.  So the whole universe has gone away, the whole universe is gone.  People are going to DVDs, they're going to DV- recorder, TiVo [TiVo Corporation], they're on their computers, they're on their cell phones.  People aren't watching broadcast television like they used to anymore.  And the vast majority have gone away.  Same thing has happened with newspapers, that's why newspapers have been sold and closed up.  The whole paradigm is shifting.  And no one seems to know where it's going.  Today in 2008 on February the 18th, no one knows where this paradigm is going because newspapers aren't being read as much as they used to, the television numbers are continually dropping so that the revenues are dropping.  So that means that companies can't continue to go on in this manner and pay the same salaries, buy these expensive cameras, do all of this stuff if the revenue from the advertising is not there, because the eyeballs aren't there.  People aren't watching.  So something is happening, television is not gonna go away any more than radio went away when television came in and everyone said, oh, radio, this is, this is gonna kill radio.  Radio is still alive and well.  Television is gonna be alive and well, but possibly in some other incarnation and we don't know what yet.  And newspapers are not gonna completely go away, they will change.  There may be a blending, there may be a blending of cell phones and computers and cable, and all of this into some huge ten-armed animal that we can't visualize right now.  Or it may not, it may go in a completely different way that we can't even foresee at this point.  Nonetheless, the change is underway.  And so, it's difficult to predict today in 2008 where we're going to be certainly five years from now, but maybe even two years from now.  I can--kids are--you go anywhere today and this is all teenagers are doing.  They're using their thumbs and they're text-messaging each other and that's all they do.  They don't even communicate.  A guy told me a story about how he threw a party for his sweet--for his daughter's sweet sixteen birthday party.  He went out into the ballroom behind his house where they were having the party and all the kids were sitting around doing this.  He walked up to the boy and said, "What are you doing?"  He said, "I'm asking that girl over there to dance."  He said, "Why don't you go over and ask her to dance?"  He said, "Because she might tell me no."  So, the whole way that we communicate with each other is changing.  All of this is going on within our lifetimes.  These--all of these paradigms have not only shifted, they've completely changed and we don't know where they're going.  When I came to WGN, as I said, it was still film.  That paradigm shifted to video.
Story_ID: 608259
Speaker 1: And, well, I left--I stayed at WGN [WGN-TV, Chicago, Illinois] for four years then I left and I went to CBS Network [WBBM-TV, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 2: Now, before we leave WGN (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 2: --who was there?  Who was on the news staff and were you the first--?
Speaker 1: I was not, I was not the first black.  I replaced a guy by the name of Wendell Smith.  Wendell Smith was a sports guy on our station, very well-known.  He had been--he started with the Defender [Chicago Defender] I believe or either The Philadelphia Inquirer, one of the, one of the big black newspapers.  But then he got into television and very well-liked guy, and Wendell was on the air at WGN until he died.  And I replaced Wendell, but I didn't go into sports.  They brought me in into news.  And so I was the second black on the air at WGN, about the same time that [HistoryMaker] Merri Dee was in programming as--Merri Dee and I got there about the same time.  She beat me there by about four months.  And Mary had been--Mary was famous here in Chicago [Illinois] as a radio personality and also television at one of the other stations before she came to WGN.  So, I was not the first by any means here in Chicago or at WGN.  But one of the early, one of the early black on-air personalities in the city because--by a few, by a few years.
Speaker 2: In those days it was [HistoryMaker] Harry Porterfield--
Speaker 1: Harry was at Channel 2, [HistoryMaker] Bob Petty was at Channel 7 [WLS-TV, Chicago, Illinois].  Bob just beat me by a few months as well at Channel 7, coming from Phoenix, Arizona.  Bob and I became good buddies and--
Speaker 2: And [HistoryMaker] Jim Tilmon.
Speaker 1: Jim Tilmn was at--well, Jim had gone from TTW [WTTW-TV, Chicago, Illinois] to I think it was Channel 5 [WMAQ-TV, Chicago, Illinois] where he had 'Tilmon's Tempo.'  And, then he ended up--then he went away for a while then came back.  All the while he was flying for American Airlines and was very well liked.  Jim and I laugh all the time because people confuse us.  And I always tell him and he always tells me, "Man, don't go rob a bank, please, because I don't want you to get me busted."  But we'd go--I'd walk down the street and people would say, "Hi, Mr. Tilmon."  And I just, "Hi, you doing" or either I'd say, "No, Jordan [HistoryMaker Robert H. Jordan, Jr.]."  And he'd tell me they'd say the same thing, "Hey, Bob Jordan," to him.  And we'd just laugh, and he told me the last time I saw him that somebody had walked up to him and said, "Oh, Mr. Jordan, we just love your daughter."  Talking about my daughter, Karen [Karen Jordan], who is now on Channel 7.  So, Jim and I have been confused over the years forever, I mean, white and black.  I mean, black people would call me Jim, white people would call me Jim.  Then, again, I've been called some of everything, everybody on the air here.  I had a guy say, walked by me and tell his girlfriend, "That's Fred Villanueva."  (Laughter) I don't know where he got that from, but I've been called some of everybody.  So, there were, there was Floyd Brown who was also black who was an announcer along with Merri Dee, and--at our station at WGN, Jack Taylor was one of the anchors, so those--we had
Speaker 2: Who was the big white news anchor at WGN?
Speaker 1: It was Jack Taylor then.
Speaker 2: Jack Taylor.
Speaker 1: Jack Taylor, Marty McNeeley later but Jack Taylor during those days.  And, but we were the ones we just named, Bob Petty, Harry Porterfield, and I were some of the first on the air here in Chicago at that time.  And, the ground had already been broken for us by other people who had gone ahead and who had gotten those jobs who'd been the groundbreakers.
Story_ID: 608260
Speaker 1: And, but there was still--this was during a time when programming decisions were being made by all-white staffs with the exception of us.  So, coverage during this time left a lot to be desired, and still does I think today in many areas.  I look at WGN [WGN-TV, Chicago, Illinois] today; we still do not have an African American in a decision-making position in our newsroom in 2008.  Not a producer, not an assignment desk person, we have writers but not--I'm talking about decision makers.  Not a soul at WGN, and that is a shame.  I mean, that's--they ought to be ashamed of themselves and I've told them that.  And we have new management now, and I'm gonna make it a point to make sure that, that message gets to our new management.  Because succeeding members of our management have said, "Well, this is gonna be a priority, we're gonna change this."  It ain't happened.  I've been there almost forty years, it ain't happened.  Not five years, not ten years, not fifteen years, not twenty years, we're talking about almost forty years.  Thirty-five years I've been there, you know.  At some point, we got to get some people up in decision-making positions because it affects the overall product, because everyone has their own worldview.  You see stories that you feel are important to you based upon your worldview.  So you're going to make sure the coverage is in that vein because it's important to you, because that's the way you see it.  And each of us has our own worldview based upon our life experiences, so we're going to cover stories and approach stories differently.
Story_ID: 608261
Speaker 1: Now, were you in on the founding of the National Association of Black Journalists [NABJ] chapter here?
Speaker 2: I was, I--it happened when I was here and I, I was at CBS [WBBM-TV, Chicago, Illinois] at the time and was traveling, so I had just left WGN [WGN-TV, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Okay, so when did you go to CBS?
Speaker 2: I went to CBS in '78 [1978], '77 [1977], late '77.
Speaker 1: When you were at WGN, during your first stint there, you were primarily an assignment reporter?
Speaker 2: I was a--yeah, general assignment reporter and I was doing some anchoring.
Story_ID: 608262
Speaker 1: Yeah, we were just talking about some of the other personalities at WGON- WGN [WGN-TV, Chicago, Illinois], which is, you know, now considered a superstation--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: In those days (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) In 1980 it became a superstation.  When I left in late '77 [1977], going into '80 [1980], I went to CBS network and reported for the Cronkite show, 'Evening News with Walter Cronkite' ['CBS Evening News with Walter Cronkite'], and I was all over the Midwest covering stories out of the Midwest bureau which was on the third floor at WBBM [WBBM-TV, Chicago, Illinois], Channel 2.  And, but I kept three days-worth of clothing in the car and had a story break out in Kansas City [Missouri], I'd fly there.  A story break out in Denver [Colorado], I was there, Detroit [Michigan], Minnesota, didn't matter, Ohio, wherever.  I was on a plane.
Speaker 1: What were some of the big stories?
Speaker 2: I did a ten year--I did a long story, which was a takeout on the ten year anniversary of the Kerner report, which was talking about the riots in Detroit.  The report basically said that our society was two separate and unequal societies, and that we were drifting further and further apart.  And this was the Kerner Commission [National Advisory Commision on Civil Disorders], was impaneled after the riots, after the murder of Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.].  And so, they came out with these results and they had several steps that should be taken to try and rectify some of these ills that they saw and that still existed in our country.  And so I went to Detroit and did that long takeout there, which was, we spent a week there talking to people about some of the change that had taken place and some of those that hadn't.  My last--one of the last stories I did at CBS was John Wayne Gacy the mass murderer here in Chicago [Illinois].  But I'd been--and that was part of the reason I was ready to leave, because I'd been on the road quite a bit traveling all the time.  And it's really tough, my daughter [Karen Jordan] was young then and it's hard on a growing family to have a member on the road like that all the time.  And you never knew, I mean, if a story broke, my pager would go off and I'd have to head to the airport, and I wouldn't even know where I was going.  And I'd call from the airport and they say, okay, we've got a ticket for you, you're going to wherever.  And I might be gone for four days or a week.  So this--we did this for almost three years and it was really tough.  And, finally, that last Christmas I was in Kansas City on a firemen's strike, spent the entire Christmas holidays there.  And just as the--into New Years, after New Year's was ending, I get a phone call saying, "We're gonna bring you back to Chicago."  And I'm going (gesture).  Little did I know, in the next breath is, "Because we've got a guy out near O'Hare [Chicago O'Hare International Airport, Chicago, Illinois] that they're finding bodies under his house."  It was John Wayne Gacy.  So they fly me back in and here I was, hadn't been home during the holidays, and I'm right back in Chicago.  And I was so busy on that story, I was staying in a hotel out there by the airport so I could cover it for the evening news and do radio all night long, and shoot for the morning news.  That's how demanding it was, it was round the clock.  I was so ready to give that up.  So when WGN in 1980 became a superstation, two separate stations really and expanded to an hour they made me an offer to come back and I took it.  And I've been there ever since.
Speaker 1: Now, just to go back to that for a minute.  That, that was an inconvenient thing to have to cover but, what a--have you ever covered anything as gruesome as that?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was the first guy up in Milwaukee [Wisconsin] for Jeffrey Dahmer, first one on the scene for that.  And we drove from Chicago like the wind.  The death of Harold Washington.
Story_ID: 608263
Speaker 1: I've covered a lot of big stories over (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Now that was a long (unclear).
Speaker 1: It was a long time ago, yeah.  People often ask me what is--what's your favorite story or what's the biggest story?  It's like asking somebody with six children what's your favorite child?  There is no favorite.  They're all important, and some maybe more than others.  But, you approach each story as though it's the most important story you've done to date and you're gonna do a pretty good job on it because that's the way you look at the story.  So, you're gonna put all of your effort and your energy and everything into it if that's the way you feel about that story.  So, I've tried to put my energy into my stories in that regard, considering each one to be the biggest one.  Of course you're not gonna do that with everyone.  Some are features and some are lightweight stories, but generally every breaking story, every important story--and you know what they are, intuitively you know what they are.  If you go at it in that manner then you'll get something back out of it, generally speaking, the same way.
Speaker 2: Okay, so there's no one story that you think had the most--
Speaker 1: You, you are touched by some more than others.  I'll--one that comes to mind is I was sent to Gary, Indiana one time.  They said that they had found--a little girl had been discovered in the attic of a house.  Her mother had left her there to die.  And so we got there just as they had taken the girl away.  And her mother had gotten strung out on crack.  Heretofore, she had been a great mother, the girl went to school clean and tidy every day.  But she got hooked, got strung out.  And she couldn't take care of this girl and would bring her McDonalds and had come by there to bring her some sandwiches to see if she was still alive.  The girl had suffered frostbite on both of her feet and both of her ankles had to be cut off.  Her feet had to be amputated at the ankles.  When they found her, a guy had come to the house to--a board-up guy was there boarding up when he heard the little girl whimpering inside.  That's how they discovered her.  So, I remember doing that story and I was touched by that story, and it, it drove home to me how serious addiction can be.  And the lengths to which people will go who are hooked on drugs.  I mean, we hear stories about people who abandon their babies and who steal from their mommas and do all of that over habits.  Well, this is a case of a woman who left her baby to die.  Maternal instincts be damned.  And so, it drove that story home to me.  And I remember months later after her feet were amputated, I remember going to the Arie Crown Theater [Chicago, Illinois] where she was at La Rabida [La Rabinda Children's Hospital, Chicago, Illinois] to be rehabilitated.
Speaker 2: Yeah, the children's hospital.
Speaker 1: The children's hospital.  And Darlwin [Darlwin Carlisle] walked out on the stage on her new prostheses and it brought tears to my eyes to see her, because she was just such a nice little girl and her mother had fallen victim to this horrible addiction.  And so, some stories you don't forget.  I often wonder how she's doing.  That's been so long ago, that's probably been ten or fifteen years now, so she's a young lady.  And I lost contact with her, I don't know how she is now or what's going on in her life.  I, I'd certainly like to know.  But then, you know, you, you make a difference here, you make a difference there, you do stories over the years.  I have come to realize, and I think I may have mentioned it earlier, that one person can make a difference after doing stories.  And seeing people who had this epiphany and decided to work in the streets or who decided to start a church, or decided to help animals, or decided to do any number of things and threw themselves into it and turned around whole communities, changed lives, saved lives, made peoples' lives better.  And all it takes is one person really dedicated to feel strongly about an issue and they can make a difference.  So, one person can make a difference.

Speaker 1: About eight--well, let's see, it's been about ten years ago or longer than that now, about twelve years ago I decided to go back and get a doctorate.  And the reason that happened--
Speaker 2: Now, now let's go back a little bit further now.  We, we--because we--you hadn't finished--
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's right, I hadn't even finished college.
Speaker 2: You finished college at Roosevelt [Roosevelt University, Chicago Illinois]?
Speaker 1: Right.  Well, we moved here so I guess I have to back up talking about my education.  I had not finished college by the time I got here to Chicago [Illinois].  So my wife [Sharon Lundy Jordan] kept saying, "Boy, when are you gonna finish college?"  I said, "You know, well, I got a good job now.  Do I really need to?"  She said, "Yeah, you need to."  So I said, "You know, you're right."  So I went to Roosevelt University and, no, to be honest, she even made some phone calls and talked to the counselors down there and found out they had a program called the bachelors of general studies.  Where a lot of your life work would also help to give you credits.  And so, she found out about that and I went down and talked to some counselors and I enrolled.  And, they took the college credits from my different schools and brought them in.  And so I went to class there for about a year or so, and I was able to graduate from Roosevelt.  And, you know, I really did feel better, my wife was right.  Here I was in a prominent position and I hadn't even finished college, so I was glad that I had done that.  So then a few years later I decided to get a master's [degree], and so I went to Northeastern Illinois University [Chicago, Illinois] not far from the house and loved it.  And so now I'm in an academic situation and I was the guy who was setting the curve.  Apparently, I'm finding out, I'm a late bloomer.  All of these years that I had been thinking that I couldn't write, that I wasn't a good student, I was wrong.  I'm turning in the papers and getting the A's and the other students are looking at me going, you know, why is he got his so nice and neat and (laughter) all that stuff.  So I loved it.  And I remember coming home telling my wife, "You know, I think I'm gonna get a doctorate after this."  And she said, you know, "Don't even think about it," (laughter) because she knew she had so much trouble getting me to finish college she said, "Don't even think about a doctorate.  I don't want you to get halfway through and quit."  But I knew by that time that I, I--that's what I wanted to do.
Story_ID: 608265
Speaker 1: So, what sealed the deal was one day I was on the South Side [Chicago, Illinois] at a story, and this woman walked up to me and said, "Hey, Mr. Jordan [HistoryMaker Robert H. Jordan, Jr.], you guys down here for those two boys who were killed around the corner?"  And I said, "No ma'am, what two boys?"  She said, 'You know, those two teenagers.  They were just killed yesterday, shot down in the street around the corner here."  I said, "Ma'am, I don't know what you're talking about."  She said, "You don't?  What're y'all out here for?"  I said, "Well, we're over here standing in front of Congressman Mel Reynolds' office."  Mel Reynolds was a congressman, who at that point was under investigation for having been with an underage girl.  As it turned out he was convicted of that and went away.  But, at any rate, we were all standing out in front of his office to try and get a statement from him.  And she said, "Y'all down here for that when we got two of our boys who were just killed, shot down in the street.  And y'all down here chasing Mel Reynolds over some sex stuff?"  I said, "Well, yes ma'am."  She said, "Which is more important?"  I said, "Well obviously, those two boys."  She said, "Well, come on."  I said, "Well, you know, that's not the way it works."  I said, "I'm already on this story and I've got to stay on it."  "But I'm telling you about these two boys, you need to come around here and do this story on those two boys."  So, she stood there and shook her finger in my face and told me how stupid it was for me to doing a story on Mel Reynolds when we've got two teenagers who have been shot down in the street and we're not looking in to see why it happened.  Boy, she really worried me.  And that--she was right.  Our whole priorities were out of balance.  We were looking for the salacious, the sensational and that's what we were chasing.  So, it worried me and I decided then that I was gonna go back to continue my school and get a doctorate, and investigate that issue.  So I did a dissertation entitled 'The Influence of Audience on Television Producers' Perspective of the Importance of Murder Victims,' [ph.] examining why it is that producers decide to cover this murder victim as opposed to that murder victim.  The bottom line is it all comes down to, to oversimplify it, comes down to an issue of prominence.  The more prominent a person is, the more likely they are to get covered.  The less prominent a person is, the more likely that you are to slip through the cracks.  It's not entirely racial, it's not entirely sexist, it's not entirely economic.  It's all of those.  It's a coefficient of many, many things that we all tacitly know.  If I ask you, for instance, which is more important to cover: the story, the murder of a man who was shot by a rifle, shot by a pistol; shot with a bowlin- I mean shot with a bow and arrow; run over by a steamroller; or had a piano dropped on his head. Right away you're gonna probably say the bow and arrow or the steamroller.  The man who was murdered with the steamroller.  I know it sounds like something out of a cartoon, but if that happened, and who knows, it could.  You're gonna cover that story before you cover the one with the guy who was shot with a handgun, we get that every day.  We don't even cover one handgun murder, it's gotta be two or three before we even roll on them.  I mean, that's how jaded we are with respect to murders nowadays.  We don't roll on one.  You know, say, how many were killed, two or three?  Okay, we'll go on, on it.  I mean, that, that's sad but that's the way it is.  So, what makes that story unusual, what makes that story different is what's gonna get it covered.  And, if there is someone who is prominent involved, it's automatic.  That probably goes back to the day of the caveman when Ogg, the fire holder died, and nobody knew how to make fire and everybody went, "Oh, my Lord, how we're gonna get fire?"  Ogg was an important guy, because he kept the fire.  And from that point on, kings and presidents and doctors, and people in society whom we feel are important are given status which allows us to feel that they are more important and we chase them.  The average Joe, who's just as good as anyone else, doesn't get the coverage.  And, who are we to feel that we can say one human being is more important than another human being, but we do it every day.  And it's a tacit understanding that we all have, it's implied in our, in our thinking.  Because, if you ask a person which person is more important to cover Mayor Daley [Richard M. Daley] or a gangbanger--and I'll give you another example, you can take a gangbanger getting shot standing on a corner, we may not cover him.  But you take that same gangbanger, put some books under his arm and having him walking to school and he gets shot, we're all over it.  So, our society places importance on some people because of what they do, what they're involved in more so than others.  And, I'm not saying it's right, I'm saying it's what we do.  I don't know how it's gonna change, I don't know if it ever will as long as we place values, as long as we codify our values on certain people.  And that's the way it's been done.
Story_ID: 608266
Speaker 1: Do you think--I know Community Media Workshop [Public Narrative] and other groups in the city [Chicago, Illinois] have raised the idea that television news, for the most part, creates more fear.  And yet, as you say, we don't even cover everything that happens.
Speaker 2: Oh, I don't doubt that it, I don't doubt that television news creates fear.  All you have to do is go into any neighborhood just about in the city when somebody is killed, and you do a man on the street interview with people.  One of the first things they're gonna say, especially in the suburbs, is, "Wow, this is, this is unusual especially in our neighborhood.  We never have anything like that in our neighborhood."  And they have--people have that sense that their neighborhood is safer.  Crime can break out anywhere, especially crimes involving crimes of passion or family squabbles, or all of those things.  So, no neighborhood is immune, no area is immune from crime today.  But, yet, we all seem to feel like our areas are safe because we get out and we walk around, we run out in the yard and we play, and we walk to the store, and we do those things.  I've been in neighborhoods where people don't do that unless they go in numbers and at certain times of the day.  Because, I've been doing interviews and I've heard (makes gun sound) go off.  And people sometimes don't even flinch.  So, it depends on where you are.  But, yes, people can sometimes become afraid when they see all the mini-cam trucks roll into the neighborhood, and the police cars.  You can't help but become afraid because it shakes your sense of security, and it destroys your feeling of well-being that, when now your area is no longer safe, it shatters your sense of security.  And so people can become afraid, and if they're watching this information come right into the home and we're standing there, and many of us are guilty of this, you know, we do the exploitive stories.  We ask the people, "Well, aren't you afraid?  Doesn't this scare you?"  I mean, I, I see reporters do that all the time.  I mean, you can do stories in a sensible manner, you can do them in an exploitive manner.  And I've always tried to stay away from doing exploitive stories because I don't think that's my role.  I think my role as a journalist is strictly to inform you of the information that I'm bringing to you.  I'm not a--I should not be a part of the story.
Speaker 1: Now, that (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) My stories--my job is to tell you information.
Story_ID: 608267
Speaker 1: Your style seems to be--and it seems to be sort of a, you know, a very dignified, straightforward approach.  Do you--did you model your reporting after any other individual or, or any, anyone else's style?
Speaker 2: I think I took, in the early days of my career, I think I took some styles from different people, or not styles but I liked certain things about certain journalists, reporters. And John Chancellor I admired the way he read in a clear understandable way.  And was able to use his voice to help the viewer, the listener understands certain emphases here, certain inflections there.  And, in the spoken word, it's very important because inflections in a voice can change the whole meaning of a word or a sentence.  So how it's said can give the viewer, the listener a different meaning than sometimes the journalist intended.  So, I mean, saying, I love you.  I love you.  Saying three words different emphasis can change the whole meaning.  So, how words are said is very important and it's all a part of the delivery.  And so anyone who, as you've asked earlier about instilling fear, you can talk to person, you can grit your teeth and talk like that and you're gonna shoot all kinds of fear into a person about something that's going on.  You can speak in a slower, more legato style that doesn't necessarily imply fear or threat and the listener gets that.  So, the journalist does have the responsibility of being cognizant of how they deliver the news to a person because it's going to have an impact on how they receive it.
Story_ID: 608268
Speaker 1: So a- it was after the Gacy [John Wayne Gacy] story that you decided to, to move away from CBS [WBBM-TV, Chicago, Illinois] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Actually, it was a few months--yeah, that was kind of the straw that broke the camel's back.  I was ready after the Gacy story to begin looking for, you know, a return to local news.  And in June of that year, six months later, WGN [WGN-TV, Chicago, Illinois] hired me back here in Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 1: And this is in nineteen--
Speaker 2: Nineteen eighty [1980].
Speaker 1: Nineteen eighty [1980], okay.  That's--I think the team over there has remained pretty much the same for years, hasn't it?
Speaker 2: For, you know, Channel 9 when I came there had the reputation of being the family station.  And, we used to say that, as long as you didn't do anything crazy, you know, once you got there and were hired, you pretty much had a job for life.  Of course, that's changed today just like all jobs, it's more tenuous.  You gotta produce otherwise you're out the door.  It's not, you know, that kind of job 'til you die place anymore.  I don't think anyplace is like that.  But, certainly, it hasn't been the revolving door that many of the other stations have been here in town where you've seen a lot of people come and go, and come and go.  And I think that is part of the success of WGN.  People know when they turn to Channel 9 they're gonna see Steve Sanders or Allison Payne, or on weekends me and they're gonna see Jackie Bange, or noon it's gonna be Micah [Micah Materre] and Tom [Tom Skilling] or--they know who're on the morning show--you get to know the personalities.  And you become comfortable with them because they're coming in your home, and people are very careful about who they allow in their homes.  And to have these strangers come into your house is kind of jarring, again.  But if you--"Oh, that's Bob Jordan [HistoryMaker Robert H. Jordan, Jr.], yeah, leave him on, I'll watch him tonight.  'Cause I, I know, I know how Bob reads, I know--I've been watching him."  You know, I get gray-haired guys coming up to me holding their grandkids saying, "Hey, man, I been watching you all my life." "Oh you, I ought to," (laughter). But, you know, I've been on the air here for all these years so it does seem like it.
Story_ID: 608269
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) How has the superstation status at WGN [WGN-TV, Chicago, Illinois] I guess since 1980 or so affected, you know, you and--
Speaker 2: I go--I can't go anywhere without being recognized.  My wife [Sharon Lundy Jordan] and I have traveled all over the world and in every country I've been recognized either by people who are from Chicago [Illinois] or who lived in Chicago, or who lived someplace else and watched Chicago news and were in this area.  But--and in the Caribbean, places like that where they watch us on satellite, people to this day watch Chicago news.  They watch the superstation, thousands of people.  And, you know, I'll go to some of the most remote islands in the Caribbean and folks recognize me.  And even in Spanish I've had someone say, (speaking Spanish) "El hombre canal nueve. Hola, como estas?" So that happened during the World Cup [FIFA World Cup].  People who were watching from Columbia and Venezuela came by, and I speak Spanish so we carried on a long conversation.  And I asked them in Spanish, "Why is that you watch us?"  And they say that they enjoy watching Chicago news.  I said, "But do you speak English?"  And they said--see, people, if you've ever learned a foreign language you know that you understand more than you can speak.  That's the first thing that happens.  And, as I began to learn Spanish, it became apparent to me that I understood more than I could speak.  So, people will understand a foreign language who can't even speak it very well.  And, if they have any training whatsoever they, they understand more than you think they do.
Story_ID: 608270
Speaker 1: Tell me, what are--well, when you look back at everything you've done to this point, is there any major thing that you would do differently if you could?
Speaker 2: (Pause) If I--the only--one of the few things I would change would be to pay more attention to languages in school.  I had an opportunity to learn French, which I just took the course and tried to pass to get it out of the way.  Now I know the value of foreign languages, I love languages.  And I wish that I had spent more time trying to learn foreign languages, that's one thing.  There aren't a lot of things in my life that I would change.
Story_ID: 608271
Speaker 1: I've been very fortunate and so I have tried to give back and I have worked on several boards to try and do as much as I can to make sure that I can influence organizations, that in some small way, to make a difference.  And I'm in one--I'm on the board of the Shedd Aquarium [Chicago, Illinois] which is kind of a boutique board to belong to.  But the others are working boards.  That's The Night Ministry, which works with homeless people, and the Safer Foundation, which works with ex-offenders.  I'm on both of those boards and I've just been asked to join the Howard Brown Center [Howard Brown Health, Chicago, Illinois], which works with the AIDS [acquired immunodeficiency syndrome] patients.  And, it's an opportunity for me to really get my hands into help people with--through--the Safer Foundation does wonderful work.  These guys who come out of prison have a bulls-eye on their backs because they are now felons, they can't jobs, can't get living wage jobs.  And very few people are going to hire them in a capacity that will allow them to live well enough so that they won't think about going back.  And Safer works to get jobs for men; it helps to get them cleaned up if they are on drugs.  It helps them with GED [General Educational Development] training and it helps to get them placed in good living wage positions, and it helps to cultivate new job opportunities for people coming out of prison.  The Night Ministry works with homeless teens and with homeless families in general.  They have a bus that travels all around the North Side [Chicago, Illinois] at specific locations.  It goes to their volunteers on the bus, pull up at a specific time, there's no one there--as cold as it is outside right now and the teens, ten minutes later there will be a line down the block.  They know the bus is gonna be there with hot coffee and soup and cookies, and condoms and hugs from the little old ladies on the bus.  And a nurse in the back who can help them if they need it, and HIV [human immunodeficiency virus] testing, instant testing, and all of that.  And for homeless teens a shelter.  So these are organizations which aren't the pretty ones, you know, but they're organizations that are really helping people, making a difference in saving lives and helping lives.  And so, I feel it is important that we all do whatever we can because we can all help someone.  And, through those organizations, I feel that I can make a difference and help.
Story_ID: 608272
Speaker 1: I didn't ask you about your production company [Jordan and Jordan Communications, Inc.].
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Tell us a little bit about that?
Speaker 2: My--started out--I started my own production company little over ten years ago when I was traveling to Nashville [Tennessee], working with the United Methodist Church doing a newscast for the Odyssey Network.  And, so I started my own company and then an offshoot of that was to start doing stories and I started doing production and stories for National Geographic [National Geographic Society] and Tribune Broadcasting [Tribune Broadcasting Company, LLC], and some other organizations.  And so, I started--I did a biography for a friend who had died, for their children.  I went over to see them because their mom died, and I knew their mom.  And so they were all six kids spread on the floor sitting down with all these photos.  So I asked them if I could take the photos home and I'd get them back to them.  So I knew enough about her life and I took all these photos from all the different families and gathered them up.  And I wrote a narration, only about four minutes and I put music to it and burned it to DVDs and took it back to the kids along with their pictures and gave it to them.  And they were enthralled but they couldn't believe it because it was a nice story about their mom's life.  And I ended it with a cassette I had of her singing a lullaby to one of the kids in her actual voice.  And it made you laugh and it made you cry, and they loved it.  They were just knocked over.  And I thought to myself, there's a market for this.  So I started inquiring, asking people, "You ever had a video biography done on your life or your family's life?"  No one had.  Well, I didn't wanna just do what a lot of guys were doing at the time, I wanted to do it in a different manner.  I wanted it to be a luxurious, first-class, documentary style biography where it runs an hour to an hour and a half in length.  And I wanted to include other family members, the people from the job, go back to the homestead, travel to the vacation home.  Well, I knew in order to do something like that it's gonna cost a lot of money.  The average person wouldn't be able to afford it.  So I narrowed my search and began to focus on high-net worth families.  In other words, wealthy families.  And it took a long time to build up that clientele because I knew that they would be the only ones who could afford the style of biography I wanted to produce.  Because, the way I wanted to do it, it's just too time consuming and too expensive to fly all over the country.  So, that's the way it began and I started with some financial institutions and banks, and just grew and grew and grew.  And that's the way it is today.  And so I thoroughly enjoy it, you meet some wonderful people.  I mean, just because people are wealthy, they're not bad people.  They just happen to have money.  And, the clients that I have worked with are doing some extraordinary things in terms of philanthropy and giving back.  And we're talking millions and millions of dollars that they give to institutions and to try to help these causes and so forth.  So many times wealthy families are misunderstood.  And I've met some really interesting people that's been interesting to work with.  And I don't have to take the job if I don't want to, and I've chosen to work with some really nice clients.  People with stories--interesting stories to tell and it's been fascinating work.  I thoroughly enjoy it.  And I write, I do all the writing.  Downstairs in the basement I have my Final Cut Pro and I screen the tapes, and pull my sound bites and transcribe them.  And, I don't do the editing but I do write them.  And my production company puts them together and we burn it on DVD and make copies to give to the family, not for broadcast but only for the family to have so that future generations can understand the family legacy and the principles and the goals of so- of the wealth builders.  And that's, that's primarily what we do.

Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: My hopes--my con- let me first say my concerns run deep.  My wife is a librarian in a middle school in Evanston [Illinois], which is a diverse community--low, medium, and upper class, upper income families.  And, so you get that whole bell curve of people.  And she comes home with stories of our kids, our black kids, the boys who somewhere down the line didn't get it.  And I know how crippling it can be when I wasn't taught math very well, and it crippled me down the road.  These guys are not getting it from before school, from the Head Start age, they're not getting it.  And they're coming in behind the eight-ball, and they never catch up.  And they have developed a syndrome that is learned defeatism because they are so far behind they know they can't catch up and so they come in the classroom with an attitude, and they're hostile because they're defensive.  And they wanna fight back at the teachers and many of the little white teachers up there either don't care or are afraid and just throw their hands up.  Many of the black teachers do go that extra length to make a difference because they have a stake and they see what's happening with these kids.  I know Sharon [Sharon Lundy Jordan] will--oh, Sharon's got a rep there as being tough, and so they know when they come in the library, don't mess with Miss Jordan.  And she, she's tough, man, believe me.  And, you know, they can't back her down.  And so, we're talking middle school kids.  Some of these kids are my size, man.  And they intimidate some of these teachers.  Well, she's not intimidated.  And they'll back down from some of the black teachers because they know they can't bully them.  And so, the teachers in turn are willing to take them aside and say, "Boy, what's wrong with you?  Don't you get it in your head, I'm trying to help you."  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  So they are willing to go that extra step which doesn't happen many times.  So, she sees a lot of this.
Story_ID: 608274
Speaker 1: And why are my concerns running deep?  Because, that gap is getting wider and wider.  Kids who are getting are on Google and they're texting and they're doing this, man, and they're into the information super highway and they're gone.  A lot of our little boys, information super highway they wouldn't even know what you're talking about and don't care.  Because they have developed the defeatism and they know that they are so far behind that they can't catch up, and so they don't even try.  And I don't know where it's going except that we have to start--the whole Head Start idea was good; that's where the efforts have to go.  Something is happening between age three and age twelve that leaves these boys with a void and they're missing something.  And they're angry, and they're dependent but you grab one and you talk to him.  I was talking to one this morning over at the juvenile detention center [Cook County Juvenile Temporary Detention Center, Chicago Illinois], and he was telling me about this riot that broke out that I was covering.  So we finished our little conversation.  I said, "Hey, boy," I said, "you're not coming back over here no more."  He said, "No, sir, I'm not coming back over here."  I said, "Come here a minute."  I said, "How did you get over here in the first place?"  And his momma said, "Well, don't worry, he's not coming back."  I said, "Don't you come back."  I said, "Don't"--no, she said, "Well, I hope he doesn't come--" I said, "Hope?  Don't say hope.  Just tell him he better not come back over here," you know.  And, she said, "Yeah, you're right."  And walked on off, you know.  Part of it is, is, is kids raising kids, but part of it is this gap, man, that already exists.  And are we gonna get beyond this gap to catch up is what concerns me, that deep void.  And so when these kids are having kids, they are perpetuating this huge loss.  I walked up to the school one day and I'm walking in--I'm walking behind this father who--or guardian or somebody who's coming up to see his kid, his pants below his butt, about to fall off, big old baggy pants and he's walking in you know, and he's walking up the stairs.  He can hardly--he's got his one hand holding his pants up.  I wanted say, "Man, if a fire broke out and you had to run, you'd trip and fall and die."  So he's holding his pants up with one hand and we get inside the building.  Who was he coming to see, his son (laughter) holding his pants, walking the same way.  It's passed on.  And my work at Safer [Safer Foundation], there are instances of grandpa, pa, and son all in the same institution.  Three generations inside the same prison.  You say that's not scary, say my, my fears don't run deep.  Of course they do.  I see that.  Those are terrible, terrible--it's just been passed on.  Just like you can pass on excellence, you can pass on mediocrity just as easily.  Probably easier.  It's probably easier just to pass on that laissez-faire and, well, shit, I don't care what you do.  You can probably pass that on a lot easier than you can the strict discipline and the determination that you have to instill in these kids.  So, that's my concern.  That's why I'm in some of those organizations.  That's why I work with them and work with the boards, and hope that, that a difference can be made.

Speaker 1: What today, when you look back on everything you've done today, what today would be considered to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: Well, probably several things that I hope I've contributed to.  I've had people walk up to me over the years and say that--and I've received letters from people and phone calls from people over the years who have said that I inspired them in this way or that way through work that I've done, or through programs that I've done.  Probably most recently was a story that I did on prostate cancer.  When I was diagnosed with prostate cancer two years ago, I went through the same conundrum that all men face today, what should I do?  Should I have radiation, should I have surgery, should I have cryotherapy, should I just wait and see where it goes.  What do I do?  Every doctor you go to tells you, you're a candidate for whatever it is he does.  In other words, a Chevy [Chevrolet] guy'll sell you a Chevy, a Ford guy'll sell you a Ford.  If you're talking to a surgeon, he wants to cut.  If your talking to an oncologist, he shoots you with radiation.  You come home, you don't know what to do.  So, I threw myself into my research just like I was doing my--for my Ph.D.  And I came up with the decision to have the da Vinci robot [da Vinci Surgical System], brand new state of the art procedure.  I chose the DaVinci because in my research it determined--and I had scrubbed open surgery when I was in the [U.S.] Army.  And had seen what those were like and knew the recovery time was long and painful, and sometimes uncertain.  Men, being incontinent and impotent, ran a strong chance of that happening.  With the DaVinci I found out that the chances are you'd have a full recovery in the 90 percentile.
Speaker 1: What kind of a procedure is that?
Speaker 2: The robotic procedure is done with you lying on the operating table over there and the doctor sitting over here facing a console on the other side of the room.  He's looking through a scope that's computerized and it operates--they make five little holes in the abdomen, insert these robotic arms with three-dimensional cameras, not 2-D, 3-D.  And the little arms articulate 360 degrees and it's magnified, and that's the key.  When they look through the cameras inside they see an area that is magnified ten, twenty, thirty, forty times, so they can zoom in.  So they can avoid those key nerves and vessels that surround the prostate allowing them to remove it but not injure the blood vessel--not injure the nerves, so that after it's out the man returns to full potency with erections, he stops wearing a pad after a week or two or three.  So he's just like he was before.  And they've gotten the cancer out.  So that's why I wrote the article.  Men used to whisper about prostate cancer, but I felt so good I said, more men have to know about this.  I talked to people at the Chicago Tribune.  They said, "It's a great idea, let's run it in the Sunday magazine.  Let's run it on Father's Day."  They ran the article on Father's Day, put my mug on the front page of the newspaper and on the front page of the magazine section.  I sat down and I wrote this long article.  I was flooded with emails, hundreds, hundreds, hundreds of emails, telephone calls.  I'd come into my office, my lights flashing, I'd, I'd get rid of--answer all my voicemail and before I could answer all my voicemail, my light's flashing again.  I mean, men and women were calling me.  One woman wrote me, to give you an example, and said, "Dear Mr. Jordan [HistoryMaker Robert H. Jordan, Jr.], thank you for doing that story.  My husband was recently diagnosed with prostate cancer.  He told me he'd rather die than undergo treatment.  He read your article now he's going for treatment.  You saved my husband's life.  God bless you."  That got those kinds of letters.  So, clearly, that was the biggest impact on a story that I have ever done here in the sunlight, the twilight of my career, because I still two years later get phone calls from men asking me what's my advice about this, what should I do about that, what do I think about that.  And now more and more men are going in and getting tested for PSAs [prostate-specific antigen], and they are not afraid to talk about it because the results are not as scary as they used to be.  And so, I probably, through that story, have saved hundreds, maybe thousands, of lives.  So that was a major impact.
Story_ID: 608276
Speaker 1: I know your daughter--you have one daughter, right?
Speaker 2: I have one daughter, Karen [Karen Jordan].
Speaker 1: Yes, and she's involved in news--television news as well.  Tell us about that, how did she become interested as if it's a mystery?
Speaker 2: Well, it was a surprise because we didn't know that Karen was going to go into broadcasting until she came home her junior year in college.  When she was a little girl, I would take her to work with me since I worked weekends.  And she would ride around in the crew car with me and go on stories and so forth.  And news had an impact on her as a little girl.  I'll never forget taking her to the Robert Taylor Homes [Chicago, Illinois] housing project.  She would hear about my stories when I'd come in the evening.  But this particular time we went there, it was a big demonstration going on and I had told her before we got out of the car.  I said, "Karen, stay close to me, okay?"  She said, "Okay." (Laughter) So we got out of the car and I'm busy doing an interview and she wandered off, but I kept her in the corner of my eye and I saw her way across this field on the other side of a playground.  I still saw her.  And all of a sudden this boy walks up behind her and puts his hand over her eyes like that and tries to pull her away.  Well, she shot him in the elbow and the boy doubled over, and she ran over to where I was and all of a sudden she's right next to me again.  So I said, um-hm.  So I finished my interviews and everything and she was right by me the whole time.  So we got in the car, and so I said to her, I said, "You know, Karen, you know, you are lucky that you are growing up in an environment where you don't have to worry about that kind of danger like some of these little girls down here do."  And I didn't realize I'd said it in that way, and tears were rolling down her face.  And I said, "What's the matter?"  And she said, "No, I just feel sorry for those girls that they have to go through that.  And I wish there was something that I could do."  So, I, I always knew she was a sweet compassionate girl and she always has been.  But I knew then that she did have this compassionate side about her because her concern was not about herself, the boy pulling at her.  Her concern was for the girls who live there.  And so, when she came home from college and said that she wanted to go to grad school at Medill [Medill School of Journalism] at Northwestern [Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois], I said, "Karen, you know, you're--it's a tough school."  And she said, "Well, my grades are okay, I'm gonna apply."  And she got in and then came out of Northwestern and went to Rockford [Illinois] right--came out of school with a job where she was in Rockford for a while and then went to Dayton, Ohio.  From Dayton she went to Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] and from Philadelphia back to Chicago [Illinois].  While in Dayton, she met the man who would become her husband.  Guy by the name of Christian Farr, who was a reporter from Philadelphia, and he too was working in Dayton.  So they met and got engaged in Dayton, he with to Philadelphia which was near his home.  And, so she ended up getting a job in Philly.  And so they lived in Philly for a while and then she got a job here in Chicago.  And he finally got one here as well at TTW, WTTW [WTTW-TV, Chicago, Illinois], the PBS station here.  So now they're both here in Chicago.  So there are three of us here working in the market.  My wife's the only one not in television.  (Laughter) So she spends her nights switching back and forth (laughter).

Speaker 1: Now, is there anything I haven't asked you about that we need to talk about before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: I think this whole idea of The HistoryMakers is such a wonderful idea because, being someone who works in the field of chronicling people's lives, I know the importance of protecting stories.  Everyone has a story to tell.  We don't pass through this life easily, and we can't do so without an agenda and without scars and without laughs and without tears.  And that's what it's about.  But capturing those stories is so important and being able to do that is wonderful, because it allows us to live.  And, if these kids, these boys, these black boys could hear some of the stories of struggle from their parents, it might make a difference.  They're not all bad.  Some are anti-social, but they're not all bad.  Many of them are just lost and they're behind and they know it even though they don't admit it.  And they are ashamed, and it's a defense mechanism for them to fight back and strike out, and join gangs and do all these things.  So telling these stories is of the utmost importance, and I'm so happy that HistoryMakers is doing it.

Speaker 1: Our last question is similar to legacy but a little bit different.  Sir, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: (Pause) I used to, I used to love to read tombstones.  There are some wonderful, wonderful sayings on tombstones.  I told you I was sick (laughter), you know, some ones like that.  How would I like to be remembered?  I think I'd like to be remembered as someone who cared.  A sensitive person who really tasted the plight of our fellow man and was touched by that.  I have been blessed with so many fortunate opportunities, a loving family, a wonderful wife [Sharon Lundy Jordan], a wonderful daughter [Karen Jordan] that, if I would be known as someone who cared and tried to make a difference, I think that's all I could ask for.
Speaker 1: All right, thank you very much.
Speaker 2: Oh, it's my pleasure.  Thank you for talking with me.
