 Finchum. We   re here today with Ruth Lincoln who  was a graduate of OAMC in 1919. We   re in Little Rock, Arkansas. I   m  Tanya Finchum and Juliana Nykolaiszyn is with us as well, so she may  chime in and ask a question along the way, too. Let   s start by having you  tell a little bit about your childhood, where you were born.  I was born on a farm that my father made in the run in 1889. And I lived  there until I was 26, school year and all.  Go ahead...  We lived very close to the schoolhouse and I learned to read early. My  dad was on the school board so he had a key to the school all through the  summer. And, I read all the books in the library, maybe once or twice,  good, bad, or indifferent. (Laughter)  Since we lived close to the schoolhouse, I went home for dinner or lunch  everyday   it was dinner then. My mother would have such a good  lunch and I would enjoy it. But I thought it was quite a chore and a lot of  fun to go home with some of my friends and spend the night and get to  take my lunch. But I didn   t do that very often.  When I went any place I rode a pony, except when we went with a  buggy and horse. Her name was Mary Jane. And she was a very gentle,  nice going horse. One time one of my schoolmates and I were riding,  and she was on one side of the saddle and I was on the other and the  saddle turned. We both fell out in the sand right at the schoolhouse. And  we got up, dusted ourselves off, and Mary Jane went on home.  (Laughter) That   s all kind of crazy.  No, it was fun days.  5  Lincoln  Finchum  Lincoln  Finchum  Lincoln  Finchum  Lincoln  Finchum  And there was another girl, named Annabelle. I used to be in spelling  contests with her and we went to different schools in the county. And  that was always fun, too. And I spelled a lot better then than I do now.  How did you decide on going to OAMC  Oklahoma Agricultural and  Mechanical College ?  Well, I went to Oklahoma City High School because my dad and mother  decided that they didn   t want me to go to a little county high school  which was, you know, a very small school. I went to Oklahoma City  High School and graduated in 1916.  My mother went up and stayed with me the first year. We had what you  would call light housekeeping rooms. And we   d drive from ten miles  out in the country to Oklahoma City. It would take two hours with a  buggy and two horses. Then we would come home on a Friday and get  ready to go back on Monday.  And we had teachers there that had traveled abroad and had degrees. I  felt very blessed to get to do that. I took French one year from a teacher  who was a Frenchman, his name was Provo. And if he got really excited  he would jump up on the chairs and speak French. We had a little  Jewish girl in the class and her name was Schwartz. One day she said,     Mister Provo, I can   t say that like you do.    He said,    I couldn   t either  if my name was Schwartz.    (Laughter) And I had some wonderful  English teachers.  Well, how old were you when the state became a state?  I was ten.  Do you remember much?  Yes. We always got The Daily Oklahoman. We   d get the early edition.  We got it at a mailbox which was a quarter of a mile from where we  lived. I remember Haskell was the Governor at that time and some way  there was something, I don   t know just whether it was chicanery or  something else, but anyway, some of his cohorts and he went to Guthrie  and I think something had been done legally about it before. But he  didn   t wait for them to make it formal. He went up to Guthrie, got the  Oklahoma seal, took it down to Oklahoma City, declared that the capital.  I remember about     And they had a wedding between Indian Territory and Oklahoma  Territory, in Guthrie, when it became a state.  6  Lincoln  Finchum  Lincoln  Finchum  Lincoln  Finchum  Lincoln  Finchum  Lincoln  Finchum  Lincoln  Finchum  Lincoln  Finchum  I think Oklahoma was always considered old Oklahoma. It wasn   t a part  of the Indian Territory, was it?  No, it wasn   t. And so you went to OAMC and went to college in 1916?  I went in 1916. I graduated in 1919. I went two years and two summer  terms because I got some credits for the home economics work I had at  Oklahoma City High School with Ms. Bess Osborne.  So you managed to finish in three years, then.  And two summer terms. I had what was known as a Life Teaching  Certificate and a degree in Home Economics.  What were some of those classes in home economics? Learning how to  sew, or   ?  Well, we had everything. I had cooking and sewing and luncheons. And  we had the politicians, the legislators, come for meals. The Dean of  Home Economics was Ruth Michaels, and she was a lady if I ever saw  one. She had finished in the East someplace. And, then I had tailoring  and hat making. The first year I taught was out in Luther, OK. Did you  ever hear of the unionized school out there? It   s about twelve miles east  of Oklahoma City. And it was a completely rural school. They had  teachers and we lived in the teacherage. I stayed with one that was a  married man and his wife. And the Superintendent lives also. That year  we had four teachers in high school, and they all had degrees. That was  unusual, I think, for everybody to have a degree. We were rated as the  best rural high school in the United States that year.  And you taught home economics there?  One year when I taught home ec     How many kids were in the school?     oh, it was a county high school so they came in buses. I can   t  remember how many, now, that they had. Maybe two or three hundred,  that close to Tulsa, you know.  Well, on campus, did you live in a dormitory?  There, or at Oklahoma   ?  Oklahoma A M.  7  Lincoln  Finchum  Lincoln  Finchum  Lincoln  Finchum  Lincoln  Finchum  Lincoln  Finchum  Lincoln  Finchum  Lincoln  Finchum  Lincoln  Finchum  Lincoln  Finchum  Oklahoma A M, I lived in    the    dormitory. There was a girl   s  dormitory, and that was the only one there was. And there was a boy   s  dormitory. And we had ROTC. I went to bed by Taps and got up by  Reveille.  And did you go to sporting events?  Yes. We went to all the football games that were there. But you know  1917 and 18 were the years of war. The world war was on in Europe.  And of course, we got into it, too. And our boys could qualify. If they  went to the training camp down at Camp Robinson, they could come out  as second degree lieutenants. So a lot of them did that. Some of them  came back and some of them didn   t.  Were there more women on campus then?  Yeah, a lot more women than men.  Did they have women   s basketball?  Mm-hmm. I never played because I stepped on my own feet.  (Laughter) Well did you participate in the tug-of-wars they had over the  pond? Do you remember those?  Oh, yes I do. I   d forgotten all about that. But I remember the fraternities  or somebody        Would fight over the pond. In tug-of-war.  I   d forgotten all about those tug-of-wars.  Did the girls not participate?  No.  No, just the boys?  They didn   t get into that.  Well did you visit the library very much?  Oh, yes, I would go to the library and study sometimes. Old Central was  there. Was the library in Old Central at the time?  It may have been, but it was in a building that looked like it had turrets  8  Lincoln  Finchum  Lincoln  Finchum  Lincoln  Finchum  Lincoln  Finchum  Lincoln  Finchum  Lincoln  Finchum  Lincoln  Finchum  Lincoln  Finchum  Lincoln  like a castle. Williams Hall   does that sound right? Or was it in Old  Central?  Seems to me it was in Old Central.  It may have been at that time period.  I remember my physics teacher was in Old Central, too.  Well it   s still there. They   re getting ready to turn that into an honor   s  college, so it   s still standing.  It   s still there, isn   t it?  It   s still there. Did you have to take swimming?  No, we didn   t have any swimming. Everybody had to take gym.  So what did you take?  I took gym.  Just gym? Calisthenics     That   s pretty much the same thing. I did that at high school, too. I  would have to get dressed after doing gym. Gym was on the basement  floor and my home economics class was on the fourth floor, so I was  puffing Europe by the time I got there. (Laughs)  Did you ride trains?  Yes and you could ride a train from Spencer, the Frisco. It was the main  line to St. Louis. We used to take trains some but not to go back and  forth to high school.  So you did horse and buggy from Stillwater to Oklahoma City?  No, I rode on the Santa Fe. I   d get on at Oklahoma City, go to Guthrie  and change, and go out on that little route to Stillwater.  So about how long would that take you? A couple of hours or half a  day?  Oh, about half a day, I guess. I   m not sure that the train always made  exact connections. Anyway, when I got up to Stillwater, I don   t know  why there wasn   t anybody there to meet me. Everybody had gone home  9  Finchum  Lincoln  Finchum  Lincoln  Finchum  Lincoln  Finchum  Lincoln  Finchum  but for the drayman. And the drayman said he   d take me out to the  dormitory. When I got out to the dormitory, they knew I was registered.  I had a roommate   it was double rooms, you know   and my  roommate   s name was Ima Coon.  Are you serious?  I did and she was a sweet little girl. Why she was named Ima Coon, I  don   t know. She was a nice little girl.  Did you pick Oklahoma State over OU  University of Oklahoma  for any  reason?  Well, people that I knew and talked to said Oklahoma State was better  for home economics.  Ok.  Although they did have home economics at Oklahoma  the University of  Oklahoma  and in Chickasha at the Oklahoma Women   s College. There  was a woman that lived here that I got to know and we would always say  we were the Okies.  Did you go back to Stillwater after you graduated?  Yes. The first year I was teaching, I went back to Stillwater for a  football game. And they were having a high school there where they  taught the girls who lived up in Northern Oklahoma that couldn   t go to a  high school and they brought them down to Stillwater. And the senior  home economics girls who wanted to teach were teaching those people  home economics. And my dean called me and she said,    I want you to  come and do that,      supervise these home economics girls. And I was  just one year out of college. So I went back and taught home economics  teacher training at Oklahoma  A M  for three years, then I got married.  My husband came over from the University of Arkansas. He was a  graduate in agriculture. He came over to OSU after the war and taught  boys who were learning to do farming on-the-job. They would be  working on a farm and he would supervise them, tell them what to plant,  how to plant and all that sort of thing. And I met him   I had gone to a  party that the dean had with another somebody and he went with  somebody, and after that we went together. After about a year or so he  was transferred back to Little Rock and we got married that summer,  July 24, 1924. It was at a Presbyterian Church there in Stillwater.  How did they decorate the church?  10  Lincoln  Finchum  Lincoln  Finchum  Lincoln  Finchum  Lincoln  Finchum  Lincoln  Finchum  Lincoln  Finchum  Lincoln  Well, we didn   t have much decoration but we got some sunflowers  along the side of the road and decorated the church. We got married at  8:00 in the morning because those July days were hot. And we didn   t  have any air conditioning. Bradford Knapp, he was President of  Oklahoma State, too. Mrs. Knapp had a party program and I said,    I  think people who get married in July are a little lacking in their  intelligence.    And she said,    Well, that   s when we got married.     And then you left Oklahoma?  Yes, we moved to Little Rock then and stayed there two years. We had  our oldest daughter there at Old Saint Vincent   s Hospital which was out  on Cross Street at the time   that   s Little Rock.  Did you have siblings, brothers or sisters?  I had one brother, Curt. And he was in the war when the armistice was  signed. And when we heard that my roommate and I decided we would  go downtown in Stillwater. What was the store there?  There was a Katz.  Katz? There was a Katz dry goods store. But it was so cold. And her  fianc   was in the hospital. And my brother, we had word that he   d been  wounded, but it was in his hand. And they both came back.  Did he stay in Oklahoma?  Yes, he stayed in Oklahoma on the farm for a while.  And your parents?  My parents are all buried about a quarter of a mile west of the farm we  lived on. This year a man called me up and said,    I   m Ben Wright. My  father and you went to school together. My father donated the land that  the cemetery is on at the end of our farm.    And about half of my  ancestors are buried there. Isn   t that interesting?  It is.  And I hear from Ben every little while. In fact, he brought me these  beads from Mundaka, Spain. (Laughs) He   s one of those people that  have done a little bit of everything. And this coconut up there  Ruth  motions to the coconut behind her  he sent me from Hawaii just recently,  he   d been out there. It   s all decorated and fixed up.  11  Finchum  Lincoln  Finchum  Lincoln  Finchum  Lincoln  Finchum  Lincoln  Finchum  Lincoln  Finchum  Lincoln  Finchum  Lincoln  Finchum  And does he send you birthday cards, too?  Yes. And one year, he was in Alaska traveling. He didn   t know how in  the world he was going to get a hundred-and-nine birthday card, so he  got two fifty year and a nine year old. (Laughs) Oh, I   ve had more fun   Sure sounds like it. And you   ve got four children?  Four children. Rowena went to Iowa State as a Kappa Delta and is a  Kappa Delta   as I   m a Kappa Delta. She graduated in home economics,  and taught for twenty-seven years, and now lives in Albia, Iowa, where  she taught school. She now lives 6 months in Iowa and 6 months in  Tucson, Arizona. But I am so happy she is able to do all that. And she  travels a lot with Elder Hostel, nearly all over the world. The latest one  was Chile.  And you   ve traveled a lot, too, haven   t you?  Yes, Rowena and I went to Peru together. Oh, my husband and I  traveled from Russia, Istanbul and Portugal on the SS Rotterdam, and  oh, that was fun.  And when would that have been?  Oh, it was in the sixties. We had moved to Van Buren  Arkansas . He  had retired then. And we went to Isle of Capri and I had the best  cannelloni I have ever had in my life there.  And did you ride a mule in Peru?  Oh, sure, mm-hmm. And I wanted to get off and carry the mule.  Was it going fast enough for you?  Well, I didn   t care how fast he went, just so we made it.  How old were you when you did that? Ninety-something?  Oh, no, I went way before that. It was before    73 because my husband  died in    73. He had retired at that time    He had retired in    61. That  was the year I was Mother of the Year  for Arkansas . Those pictures  out there, as you come in the door, are from that, Arkansas Mother of the  Year. And we went to New York and spent a week at the Waldorf  Hotel, and     Oh, that was special.  12  Lincoln  Finchum  Lincoln  Finchum  Lincoln  Finchum  Lincoln  Finchum  Lincoln  Finchum  Lincoln  Abraham  Lincoln  Finchum  Lincoln  There   s a picture of the Waldorf Astoria, that picture of the whole group  of State Mothers of the Year is back there. I met all sorts of people at  that. That was through the American Association of Mothers  Arkansas  Association of the American Mothers, Incorporated sponsors this award  currently . I don   t know if you ever heard of them or not.  I have not, I will have to look.  Well, there was a mother from Oklahoma there. There was a mother  from every state in the Union, and Puerto Rico, and what   s the other  place, I can   t think     Tell me about the first time you voted.  Oh, I was delighted. The vote was allowed in    18 but there wasn   t a  national election until    20. My mother voted too for the first time. And  my dad was so pleased that she and I could vote too.  Do you remember who you voted for?  No, I don   t know. I think McKinley was President long about the time I  was born.  So you would have voted in Oklahoma then   you were still living in  Oklahoma?  Oh, yes, I wasn   t married then.  Did you get to vote in the state election? We had our first woman  legislator in Arkansas about that time too, about 1920. So you may have  voted for her, too.  We had one in Arkansas, let   s see, what was her name, in Jonesboro?   Ruth asks of her daughter, Lucy Lincoln Abraham, who joins the  interview   Carrie Hathaway?  Yes, m-hmm. Arkansas. She was a Senator. She took her husband   s  place.  Tell me about your first car.  Oh, it was a Ford. I got it when I was first teaching school. It was a Ford  Coupe. I paid  600 for it. I paid all but the last payment in cash. I saved  up for it. I thought I could do anything I wanted to do, you know, very  13  Finchum  Lincoln  Finchum  Lincoln  Finchum  Lincoln  Finchum  Lincoln  Finchum  Lincoln  Nykolaiszyn  Lincoln  independent.  What color was it?  Black.  And how long did you keep it?  I don   t remember. I remember that when we got married my car had  less miles on it than my husband   s car, so we changed the engines. We  had it quite a long time.  Where did you travel in the United States before you were married?  I used to go to all sorts of teachers conventions when I was teaching.  And the girls would always say, Ruth, you remember all the jokes.  Because I lived when people had taught me. I taught there at Stillwater.  And we went to New Orleans and Biloxi. We went to Kansas City one  time. I went to Bristol, Virginia, one time for a Kappa Delta  Convention. I was Chairman of the Archives Committee.  Did you go to Chicago?  Yes. I did a nutrition course in Chicago while I was at OSU and we went  there with the children one time. And I remember that I was telling the  children that we must not lose one of them. We went to the bathroom in  one of the buildings. Did I have a sign around you  Ruth asks of Lucy ?  I had a sign around Lucy, she was just a little bitty one. And I told her if  she got lost to show people outside. And I came out of the restroom and  there was Lucy holding up her sign.    Momma, I didn   t know where you  were.    We only had three children then.  And did you go to Chicago while you were still in school?  Seems to me like I did. No, not while I was still in school. You know,  my parents didn   t have any money but what they got off the farm. They  made great sacrifices to send me to school, and I certainly do appreciate  it. But they were so set on my having an education.  Tell us about your sorority.  Well, when I went to Oklahoma the Thetas asked me to a party and I  forgot to go. They never asked me anymore. But there was one of their  women that belonged to that Theta Chapter from Nashville, Arkansas, of  all things, and after I came to Arkansas, she was State Supervisor of  Home Economics. It was Alma Keys and she became one of my best  14  Nykolaiszyn  Lincoln  Nykolaiszyn  Lincoln  Finchum  Lincoln  Finchum  Lincoln  Finchum  Lincoln  Finchum  Lincoln  Finchum  Lincoln  friends. She knew my family and everything.  Did you have a sorority house on campus?  Yes, I helped them buy it. It wasn   t on the campus then, it was on  Knoblock Street. Corner of Knoblock and   that   s three or four blocks  over from the campus. They bought that and    I don   t remember too  much about it. It wasn   t long until they got a bigger house.  We had other houses then called    practice houses     in the Home  Economics department . We lived in the house for a week or month,  I   ve forgotten which, and had charge of meal planning or some task each  time and it was quite something to do that, too. But then, I went off the  campus. I got married. I wasn   t there when they got the one on College  Street  University Street .  What types of activities did you do in the house, did you have parties or  did you eat dinner there? Tell us about that.  Ever so often we   d have a party. When we   d have a party we   d have one  or the other fraternities over, maybe one of the other sororities.  Did they have dances?  Dances, yes, we   d have dances.  Big bands?  Not big bands   maybe some phonograph records, I can   t remember  exactly. But we had music, I know that.  So what did you do for fun?  We had some parades once in a while. Homecoming parades.  Did they decorate?  Oh, my, yes. Lots. And then I guess sometimes we   d have parties after  football games. I can   t remember much about that. Because there  weren   t a lot of men left.  Had to dance with the girls, huh? Is that when you learned to play  bridge?  No, I didn   t learn to play bridge then, I learned after I was a faculty  member. I didn   t learn very much. I wasn   t a very good player.  15  Finchum  Lincoln  Nykolaiszyn  Lincoln  Finchum  Lincoln  Finchum  Lincoln  Finchum  Lincoln  Finchum  Lincoln  Finchum  Lincoln  Nykolaiszyn  Lincoln  But you are now, I hear.  No, I just manage to get along. (Laughs)  Did you have a curfew when you were a student?  Yes, I tell you we went to bed by the military playing Taps and got up  with Reveille.  Did they have a graduation ceremony?  Oh, yes.  Did your parents come up for that?  Yes. They were there.  Well one daughter got a home economics degree, what about the other  ones?  All three of my daughters earned home economic degrees, and say they  never were sorry.  I   d say it   s changed a little bit since the time you took it.  Yes. Rowena, the oldest one taught general science. And Lucy taught  science and home economics. Of course, we took a lot of science in  home economics. All kinds of chemistry, nutrition, childcare, and all  sorts of things.  Well where was the practice house?  Let   s see, it was on   it seems to me it was on Duck Street. I know  where it was but I don   t remember the name of the street. It was a little  above the ordinary house, it had quite a lot of rooms. Oh, one other  thing we did. This flu epidemic hit the younger boys that came to get  ready to go to the Army, and they were awfully sick and the home  economics girls took care of them.  Tell us about the cafeteria on campus.  Oh, we had a,    Big Ben   . He was a great big ol    fat man and he loved  his bottle. And he   d cook things and slap them on the plate with his  hands. He was not very nice, but we all liked him. He wasn   t very  cultured.  16  Finchum  Lincoln  Finchum  Lincoln  Finchum  Lincoln  Finchum  Lincoln  Finchum  Lincoln  Finchum  Lincoln  Finchum  Lincoln  Well, someone told us that you can sing the song.  I can   t anymore. I used to be able to.  Ruth begins to sing     O-A-M-C,  O-A-M-C we sing your praise tonight, we   ll sing your worth for all the  earth, O-A-M-C. Now if you call that singing  I used to be able to play  it on the piano.  Can you do the Oklahoma War Hoop?  The war hoop? Lucy  (Laughter)  Oh, my children and I sometimes, my husband drove to 4-H camp and I  would take the children. There were three children at that time and we  would go to Oklahoma, out across that hot prairie, you know. My  children   s faces would get so red. One of the things I would amuse them  by was giving them an Oklahoma war hoop.  Can you give it to us?  Oh, are you going to write all that stuff?  Ruth starts to shriek     Ow-wey   (Applause) (Laughter) Oh, my, my.  You still can do it.  You know, I have no secrets now. (Laughter)  You may have a few more. How did you cross the river, then, if you  went from here     The bridges.  One lane, or two lanes?  There were two lanes. Ah, I don   t remember, I guess there were two  lanes.  It would take you awhile to get from here too, back in those days  wouldn   t it?  Yes. We usually started from Van Buren because that   s where my  husband grew up, that was home to him. When we were retired that   s  where we went back to and built a house. We thought we wouldn   t be  speaking by the time we got through, but we never had a cross word  building the house. We had a really good builder and he usually listened  to me. (Laughs) The house is still there, it was a ledge rock house, it was  real pretty.  17  Finchum  Lincoln  Nykolaiszyn  Lincoln  Nykolaiszyn  Abraham  Lincoln  Finchum  Lincoln  Finchum  Lincoln  Abraham  Nykolaiszyn  Lincoln  Nykolaiszyn  Lincoln  Finchum  Ledge rock.  It took an artisan to do it, to fit them into each other. This rock came  from out around close to Charleston, Arkansas.  Do you remember the Dean of Women on campus at the time?  Well, there was Ruth Michaels, and then there was Nora Talbot. After  Ruth retired, Nora Talbot went in, and she   d been a teacher there. And I  can   t remember who went in after her. I   m an old crippled turkey about  that. (Laughs)  Now was it Ms. Michaels or Ms. Talbot who hired you to teach?  It was the Dean of Home Economics.  Well, I   d always wanted to be a teacher, and you know that was the  thing women did at that time. There were not very many who went into  secretarial work.  Either a girl went into nursing or home economics?  Yes. I never had any desire to be a nurse.  Well you had that experience taking care of the flu.  Yes, there was that of course. I knew some of things that they did. They  had home nursing and registered nursing.  Who was the Dean of Home Economics at the time?  Ruth Michaels was the Dean of Home Economics at that time.  Ruth Michaels was    she was a graduate of some school  Simmons  College , it was a little different, I   ve forgotten what it was.  And Mrs. Kent, do you remember Mrs. Kent?  Oh, she was Dean of Women in the dormitory. She was wonderful. She  was married and her husband was at Corvallis, Oregon, and I think he  was teaching at school up there, and I don   t know whether she needed  money or what, but she came down here, and she was wonderful. She  kind of mothered the girls.  That   s what we   ve heard, too.  18  Lincoln  Finchum  Lincoln  Finchum  Lincoln  Finchum  Lincoln  Finchum  Lincoln  Nykolaiszyn  Finchum  Lincoln  Finchum  Lincoln  Finchum  Lincoln  Finchum  Lincoln  Finchum  And I was there when  Earl A. Pritchard  was there in basketball.  Well tell us a little about that then.  I just remember how good he was. And who else was there    Well this  man   it seems he had a building named for him. And they would let  him referee at Oklahoma A M and OU ball games.  That   s a little bit of home cookin    huh?  That   s how highly they respected him.  You   re not thinking of Gallagher?  Gallagher  Yeah, that   s who it was, I think.  He   s a big name, he does have a building.  I thought he had a building. What was his first name?  Edward.  Ed. Edward.  Ed Gallagher. Edward Gallagher, I don   t remember that as his name     He was the wrestling coach, Gallagher was.  Yes. Well, anyway, he was very well thought of.  Yes. He still is. And they had a farmer   s fair?  Yes. Oh, they used to have one. They have a state fair now. And one  year with this roommate of mine, the one that I went downtown with, we  were sent down there for a week to advertise Oklahoma State. We  would be so tired when it came time to leave, we went back and stayed  at the hotel all week. But we really did sell the place or at least we  talked about it.  And were the colors still orange and black?  Yes, they still were. Are they still?  Yes. I read somewhere your freshman class chose green and white for  their class colors.  19  Lincoln  Finchum  Lincoln  Finchum  Lincoln  Finchum  Lincoln  Abraham  Lincoln  Finchum  Lincoln  Nykolaiszyn  Lincoln  Finchum  Lincoln  I don   t remember that.  Yeah, that seemed strange, I thought.  I was kind of in the middle because I graduated, see, in three years. I  graduated in the class of    19 and I should have graduated with the class  of    20.  Under your picture in the yearbook it says women   s suffrage. You were  for women   s suffrage?  I probably was. Still am. I   m so proud of Blanche, you know, Blanche  Lincoln  Blanche is a U.S. Senator from Arkansas and is Ruth   s  granddaughter-in-law. She is married to Steve Lincoln, Ruth   s son Ben   s  youngest son .  Sure. Well what do you think has been the biggest change in anything  during your lifetime? What do you see as the biggest change? Not  counting computers, let   s forget computers, just one of the biggest  changes.  Well, electricity, in a way it   s been, you know, used for everything. It  didn   t used to be. We would have to build a line for about a mile if we  had electricity. Not very many farmers could afford that. We lived in the  middle of a block   the middle of a mile where they had electricity on  each end but not across.  So she didn   t have it.  But the strides that have been made in electricity, having electric  everything, particularly kitchen utensils.  Oh, like a mixer and coffee maker     So many different kinds of things. Well then of course the matter of cars.  I remember gasoline was a nickel a gallon way back then.  What   s your favorite kitchen appliance?  Well, electrical cooking, not having any gas at all. One of my helper   s  says everything is in electric in the house where she lives.  And the microwave.  That came much later. That hasn   t been more than twenty-five years  since we   ve had microwaves.  20  Finchum  Lincoln  Finchum  Lincoln  Finchum  Lincoln  Finchum  Lincoln  Finchum  Lincoln  Lincoln  Finchum  Lincoln  Finchum  Lincoln  Finchum  Lincoln  Finchum  It   s about that, yeah. And the electric sewing machine?  Mm-hmm. And I sewed a lot because I had three daughters, I had to  sew.  Made lots of dresses, I guess.  Then my oldest daughter and youngest daughter have the same birthday,  thirteen years apart.  And what about your son?  My son was the second one. He became a surgeon.  You   ve done well.  Yes. If you count them up, I have seven doctors in my family. From  OB/GYN to rheumatologist to cardiologist to an orthopedic surgeon and  a breast surgeon. I have a granddaughter in Oklahoma City who   s in  orthodontics. She   s on the northeast side of Oklahoma City. They say  they are trying to get all the medical work from OU to Oklahoma City.  To the health science area.  Mm-hmm. She just started this year but she got all sorts of prizes and  accolades, money and she   s in dental school.  And Lucy   s husband is a gastroenterologist.  So you   ve got the bases covered just about.  My husband said, well, when you have all these doctors in your family,  you don   t have any trouble, do you? He says, they tell you to go to bed  and take an aspirin. (Laughter)  Well, when you were in home economics what type of food did you cook  in the Practice House?  Oh, heavens, I don   t remember.  Not a favorite recipe from then that you still use?  Well, the other day I circled a favorite recipe and you know what I did?  I did tomato gravy. You   ve never heard of it?  I   ve never heard of it, no.  21  Lincoln  Finchum  Lincoln  Abraham  Lincoln  Finchum  Lincoln  Finchum  Lincoln  Abraham  Finchum  Lincoln  Finchum  Lincoln  Abraham  Well, you take fresh tomatoes if you have them, you cut them up and put  them on the stove and let them cook out. You don   t add any water, they  have enough water. It lets the tomatoes get soft, so you stir them up,  you know, mash them. And then, my Aunt Ida, as a requirement, had  pure cream. You stir flour into the cream and put that into the tomatoes.  You add salt, maybe a little sugar if you want to, and you can put onion  into it if you want to, and serve it over biscuits.  Sounds good.  It is good. My one daughter asks some people to come out to her lake  house. She says, I want you to come out and have breakfast. This crowd  of people came and they had tomato gravy. It   s real good.  It is good. I can   t make it but I sure do like it. Do you ever put butter in  it?  Oh, yes, add some butter. And I use condensed milk instead of cream  because I am really not a very calorie cook. I don   t like things too rich.  Well it sounds good, I   ll have to try it. Well what do you plan to do on  your 111th birthday? Have you thought that far ahead?  Heavenly days, I don   t know. I can   t believe anything that would top  this last one.  Really? That   s wonderful.  You know, we had fifty-five at my 110th birthday luncheon. A lot of  them have married off, you know, and one of them has children already.  One of my children   s children has children.  She   s has a great-great granddaughter.  So five, six generations.  Is her picture back there?  Ruth asking Tanya to look on the table   There   s a little baby. She   s cute.  She is cute. And she was down here a year ago and they didn   t put  shoes on her. I said,    Don   t you believe on keeping shoes on that  baby?    And they said well,    She   s not a year old.    And this year, she did  have shoes on, didn   t she?  She   s twenty months old, now.  22  Lincoln  Nykolaiszyn  Lincoln  Abraham  Lincoln  Abraham  Lincoln  Abraham  Lincoln  But anyway, we   ve had a lot of fun. But we lost one boy, Lydia lost her  little boy, when he was eighteen. Just ready to go to college. And it was  a freak accident. And we don   t ever get over that. We just live with it.  Tell us what you did for your 110th birthday.  Well, we had them come on Thursday, my birthday was on Sunday.  They came on Thursday night, one couple did. Then on Friday evening,  we all went out, for people that were here yet   and had a meal together.  At Crews restaurant.  And then, the next day, was a big day. We had lunch at the Country  Club, the Little Rock Country Club. They had the best carrot cake I ever  ate in my life. It was so good, wasn   t it?  53 people attended where the  family showed a video of her life. Professionals from Dallas had taped  her telling her story and they showed it at the luncheon   It was wonderful   It had a lot of nuts and good stuff in it. Then that afternoon we went  down to the bridge. It is a pedestrian bridge that   s across the river, the  Arkansas River. Just right at the edge of where the poles are. They call  it the Dam Bridge. And I had a golf cart to take me up to the top because  it was pretty steep up there. Then I walked to the middle and we had all  these dignitaries up there. We have a Representative, he   s Vic Snider,  and he got married late in life and had a baby boy. That is the only child  that ever lived and he takes him in everywhere. He was there, and a lot  of other people. And you look down the river and you can see all the  way down where the harbor is, you know, for the river, where the boats  stop. It   s a beautiful view. And then we came back from that and went to  a little park and I had two interviews  one newspaper and one television   there, one from a man and one from a woman, and I don   t know where  they ever showed that. But then we went out to one of Lucy   s sons who  has a great big house. They put me to bed on one of the davenports and I  stayed there for about an hour and a half. And then all of them came in  and we had supper there. And that   s when John  Bangert  sang   he  wrote a song  Younger than Springtime Are You  and sang it to me  there.  She had two people sing to her, her grandson sang a song, and then there  was another man there that played the piano, and he sang, what was that  song? A beautiful voice. He sang to her.  He had a theatrical voice.  23  Abraham  Lincoln  Abraham  Lincoln  Finchum  Lincoln  Oh, an operatic voice, it was just beautiful.  What song did he sing to me? Younger than Spring Time, was that it?  Yes, Younger than Spring Time. Or something like that. Anyway, we  had a good time there. One of my granddaughters  Jackie Lincoln  that  has been to school at Boston University came over and sat by me and we  talked and visited, and I told her to pull her legs up this way and touch  her chin to them  Ruth begins to do this leg motion . I can do it along  this side. And she says,    I want to see if I can do it.    You can see how  proud that makes one. The next day, we all went to the same  Presbyterian Church and filled up six rows. And my circle asked if they  could have lunch for me over at the new Youth Building we have right  there on the same campus. And I said okay. Oh, everybody still there  went over there to have lunch before they left. And after that we went up  and had the carriage ride  furnished by Parkway  that afternoon. The red  and white leather carriage and the horse named Joe.  Belgian horse.  And that thing there, that poster, as we came in  the poster was hanging  on Ruth   s wall , says Happy Birthday. And one of my women friends  who I didn   t think was very able to do anything was out and she was  saying,    I want a ride  I want a ride with Ruth      First, I had all my family ride. That was a lot of fun because in Parkway  Village you ride around the streets and people walk downstairs and  upstairs they have balconies and they came out there and they waved at  me. And my son says,    Mom they   re waving at you  You wave back at  them     You know, wasn   t that wonderful, that all those people had fun.  They did. And then we had ice cream.  What else did you do for your birthday?  We had the carriage ride. And I came home that night and flopped. The  next day, though, I had a dozen  for lunch in the game room    Lucy and  Lydia were here, but all the rest of the people were ones I had known for  a long time. We played bridge together, some of us. One of the girls had  said over at the Lemonwood dinner one night, I lived over there for eight  years. I   ve been here about sixteen or eighteen. She says,    I need a  friend     I said,    I   ll be your friend.    And we have been friends ever  since. She goes to the grocery store and brings me flowers almost every  Tuesday. Oh, people have been so good to me. She gave me that table  back there behind you, see that white table? I use that to eat on. And the  other friend I had such a good time with gave me all these toys. You  push and they jump up and down for you.  24  Finchum  Lincoln  Finchum  Lincoln  Finchum  Lincoln  Finchum  Lincoln  Finchum  Lincoln  Finchum  Lincoln  Abraham  Lincoln  Abraham  Finchum  They entertain you.  Yes, and Blanche gave me one that you can twist his tail and he will  scratch your back. (Laughter) And I believe in the serenity prayer.  Which is   ?  Lord, give me the courage to change what I can change and the wisdom  to know the difference. And then I have another thing here   you   ll have  to move your chairs  Ruth is motioning to open the drawer behind  Finchum . You see them in there, kind of fancy all around? Yeah, that   s  it. Read that.     Outside my window, a new day I see. And only I can determine what  kind of day it will be. It can be busy and sunny, laughing and gay. Or  boring and cold, unhappy and gray. My own state of mind is the  determining key. For I am only the person I let myself be. I can be  thoughtful, do all I can to help, or be selfish and think just of myself. I  can enjoy what I do and make it seem fun, or gripe and complain, make  it hard on someone. I can be patient with those who may not understand,  or belittle and hurt them as much as I can. But I have faith in myself and  believe what I say, and I personally intend to make the best of each day.  You can have that if you like it.  But it   s your only copy.  No, I   ve got some more.  It   s nice. That   s a good way to approach life, isn   t it?  That   s pretty much my philosophy.  It   s a good one  So did you introduce everyone that came to your party?  I didn   t. We had a Master of Ceremonies.  No, no, at your luncheon.  I got up and told them how pretty it was and how proud I was of them.  And that their daddy would be so proud of them, too.  And that was at the Country Club.  You had a nice long happy weekend didn   t you?  25  Lincoln  Finchum  Lincoln  Abraham  Lincoln  Abraham  Lincoln  Finchum  Lincoln  Finchum  Lincoln  Lincoln  Yes. One year at a birthday celebration after lunch, we had a bus come  and take us to the Clinton Library. It wasn   t finished then. Say, by the  way girls, you ought to see that Clinton Library, it is something else.  Yes, we   ve got to come over and do that.  That would be worth a special trip. The man that took us there was, they  told him to find out everything he could about other Presidential  Libraries. There   s only   this is the fourteenth one. No one had one until  Franklin Roosevelt did. And they went all over and found out where  they are located. Most of them are located out of the main part of town,  hard to get to. This one is right downtown. And they built a couple of  hotels. This fellow that did this   what   s his name?  I can   t remember. Bill Clark was one of the contractors. The architect I  can   t remember. Skip Rutherford?  Skip Rutherford, he did all this. The land needed something and Clinton  told him to do something about it. He had a daughter that needed to go  to something and have a school here. The school was really something.  They had me one day to conduct the school at the Clinton Library. But  they located this one downtown and had two hotels built that don   t  charge high prices. So people could come here and see it and go to a  hotel and wouldn   t be broke at night. And I was interviewed one time   by Skip Rutherford at the Clinton School of Public Service . And I got  to laughing and tickled and everybody laughed with me. And we had the  biggest time.  They say that   s the best interview he   s ever given to anybody. It   s on  the web. It was December 7, 2006. It   s just hysterical.  They stood up and clapped. They asked me how I got from Oklahoma  to Arkansas. I said in a car. (Laughter) But it was a lot of fun. I   ve had a  lot of fun.  While you   re on your birthday, let   s go back. We need to get this on  tape, too. Your proclamation from the Governor. About your  Governor   s Commendation from Governor Brad Henry.  That   s your Governor. You know him?  I   ve met him.  Oh course, I don   t know him at all. It was very nice.  That other laminated thing over there, you see that? That was the  26  Finchum  Lincoln  Abraham  Finchum  Lincoln  Finchum  Lincoln  Finchum  Lincoln  Finchum  Lincoln  Finchum  Lincoln  Finchum  Lincoln  invitation they gave me from Parkway. The woman that runs the  Parkway Village brought it over to me.  That   s a good picture. Blue is your color. And you   ve got your  carriage.  And so many people got to enjoy it. That   s what I liked.  They were all seated under the Commons, under the Portico. They had  three or four rows deep on both sides so all people could come in and get  on the carriage. It held ten people, so they   d ride nine people with  mother around, all around, and then they   d unload them and get the  other group. So almost all people in Parkway got to ride.  Very much fun.  And the kids wanted to go and several of them drove up with him on the  driver   s side. They loved that, too.  I   d say that brought back memories from your childhood, too, riding in a  buggy?  Yes.  So what did your father do on the farm? Grain or cattle or both?  Both. More hogs than anything else. He used to ship hogs to Fort Worth  or Kansas City. And in those days that was quite a chore to get the pigs  to the railroad. They didn   t have great big trucks. They just had wagons.  And how bad were winters during that time? Were winters very bad?  They were. You know how cold Oklahoma can get? That wind comes  right out of   not even a peach orchard can stop it. (Laughs) I remember  one time my brother skated from our place to Spencer. The snow was  that deep.  Oh, gosh.  Spencer is just a little town. All they had was a grocery store, a bank, a  couple of churches or so. That   s where I went to Sunday school. That  was the Methodist Church.  And now you go to Presbyterian.  Now I go to the Presbyterian Church.  27  Finchum  Lincoln  Finchum  Lincoln  Finchum  Lincoln  Finchum  Lincoln  Finchum  Lincoln  Finchum  Lincoln  Finchum  Lincoln  Finchum  Lincoln  Nykolaiszyn  Lincoln  Finchum  Can you tell us why the switch?  Well, I never felt real close to the one in Spencer   see I was tired from  school and I couldn   t go to church on Sunday and do all the other things  I did. When I taught and was in Stillwater, I think all the girls and I   I  think one of them was Christian and one was, I don   t know. Some went  to the Presbyterian Church and I got in the habit of going there. The  man   s name was Allen that married us. Is that church still there?  There   s a Presbyterian Church there on maybe Husband and 6th Street. I  don   t know how old it is, but it   s the only Presbyterian Church in town  so I   d say it   s still the same one, right across from the Methodist  Church. When was the last time you were in Stillwater?  Well, I went back to my fiftieth graduation and fiftieth Kappa Delta  reunion.  1969.  I don   t remember if I   ve been back there since then or not.  Well campus has changed a lot since then.  That   s what they all tell me.  We   ve got a big library. Theta Pond is still there, though.  Oh, it is? What was that lake that we used to go to?  Lake Carl Blackwell? Lake McMurtry?  No     Oh, you   re thinking of Yost?  Lake Yost, yeah. Still red and muddy?  Probably. Haven   t been by it lately. I think the train went out there.  I can   t remember.  What would you do at the Lake? Swim?  I don   t remember. Maybe we had to swim in that muddy water. (Laughs)  Well, they don   t do tug-of-war anymore at Theta Pond. But they   ll throw  28  Lincoln  Finchum  Lincoln  Finchum  Lincoln  Finchum  Lincoln  Finchum  Lincoln  Finchum  Lincoln  Finchum  Lincoln  Finchum  Abraham  Finchum  Lincoln  Finchum  Lincoln  guys in, guys who get engaged.  All the agriculture buildings used to be west.  They still are, uh-huh, right.  The engineering building was on the campus.  Well it   s close to the Library now.  And Morrill Hall.  It   s still there. That was the administration building when you were  there, right?  Mm-hmm. Old Central.  Old Central.  And there were a lot of agriculture buildings. They used to keep cattle  and milk the cows   the boys that took agriculture did that.  Well and they had the Dairy Barn that had ice cream. They just tore that  down this year.  They don   t do that anymore.  No, they tore it down. Put something else up.  It would be fun to go back.  You need to come  We   ll show you around.  How many students were there then?  I think 2,300, not very many.  The  Student  Union building was there then, we stayed in the Union  Building.  Yeah. The hotel is still there and they have added on to it since    69; it   s  a very nice building. So there are some changes since then. And with  athletics, they are building onto the stadium.  How big is your stadium?  29  Finchum  Lincoln  Finchum  Abraham  Finchum  Lincoln  Abraham  Lincoln  Abraham  Lincoln  Finchum  Lincoln  Abraham  Lincoln  Finchum  Lincoln  Finchum  When they finish it will hold sixty thousand.  Sixty.  Yes. But they   re not quite finished with it yet.  How many students do you have now?  About twenty-three thousand.  How big is the University of Arkansas?  I   ll find out for you.  Seventy-two thousand?  Something like that.  The University of Tennessee   see I have two, I have a daughter and a  grandson that both live in Tennessee. Brentwood, Tennessee, which is  near Nashville. Old Hickory is the street that divides it. They   ve lived  there for twenty-five years. And my son is, I mean grandson, he   s a  cardiologist at Vanderbilt. And my granddaughter, great granddaughter,  went to high school at the Vanderbilt High School. It   s in the college  building but they have different teachers.  You   ve got a lot to keep up with, don   t you?  Woo  And I used to send them all birthday cards and Christmas  presents. I don   t do that anymore.  She still sends birthday cards and Christmas cards, just doesn   t put  money in them anymore.  At twelve dollars an hour for people to wait on you now, I have to cut  down on something.  So how many Christmas cards do you mail out?  Well, I   ve always sent Christmas cards, and this year I   m sending  Christmas letters and one of my girls is helping me. She can do the  address labels and do the printing and stamp the letter. She   s just  wonderful.  And you just tell her what to say.  30  Lincoln  Abraham  Lincoln  Finchum  Abraham  Lincoln  Finchum  Lincoln  Finchum  Lincoln  Finchum  Lincoln  Finchum  Lincoln  Finchum  Lincoln  I dictate letters to her.  But she still writes on the letters.  I can still sign my checks. But it   s awful not to be able to see.  But you   re getting around pretty good   She asked you about how many Christmas cards you send out?  Oh, about eighty.  That   s quite a few.  And I don   t send any in town.  Hmm.  You know, you see people everyday, or every little while.  Well Christmas cards are special, that   s one way to keep in touch when  you don   t see them very often.  And when they write me really long letters and tell me all about all their  children and grandchildren, I get tired of reading them (Laughs). And  they send me pictures of grandchildren, but I love to have a picture of  them.  Well how many birthday cards did you get this year?  Well, about all this stuff with this birthday, I had 126 and two foreign  countries. I had some from Hawaii. People are interested in this old  woman. Oh, let me tell you a cute little joke. There was a woman that  went by a house one day. She saw this, what looked like an old man  sitting on the front porch. She thought well I   ll just go ask him about  how he got to be so old. So she went and said, well, will you tell me  about yourself. And he said   about your longevity. He said, well, I  smoke about three packs of cigarettes a day, and drink about half a  gallon of whisky about everyday or so. And then I eat plenty of foods  and don   t ever exercise. She says, well how old are you? He said,  twenty-six. (Laughter) Had you heard that one before?  No  Well I know you have been asked lots of questions, is there one no  has thought to ask?  I   ve been asked lots of questions.  31  Finchum  Lincoln  Finchum  Lincoln  Finchum  Lincoln  Finchum  Lincoln  Finchum  Lincoln  Finchum  Lincoln  Finchum  Lincoln  Finchum  Lincoln  Anything we haven   t thought to ask?  Well, I think you   re wonderful being this interested in me. And I  appreciate your coming down on a bad day.  Oh, but it   s going to be a pretty ride back. The sun is shining   And I have been delighted to meet each one of you and have this  connection between my alma mater and me.  Well, I have a degree from your alma mater, too. It   s from human  environmental science, which is what they call home economics now.  What do they call it now?  Human Environmental Science. HES.  Yes, that   s such a big name.  It is, it really is.  You need to keep doing it. And you   re a librarian?  Mm-hmm.  I have some good friends who are librarians.  And you   ve done some library work yourself? Helped build a library?  Oh, yes. Well, my husband and I got a millage passed in Crawford  County to have a county library. And everybody told us,    Oh, it will  add taxes, you can   t do it.    Well, we went around and knocked on doors  and got it done. Eventually, it became a regional library. And then we  had access to five counties in Arkansas, including Fayetteville. Then we  furnished books for seventeen counties for blind people and people who  couldn   t read.  Well Arkansas is lucky to have you transplanted.  Well I   ve done a lot of things in Arkansas. In Paragould, I did a lot of  PTA work and that sort of thing. And then when I moved to Van Buren,  they needed a girls    shelter. We were real good friends with a county  judge and we asked him what we could do to help at church. And he  said, well get some place to put kids when they are picked up for  speeding instead of putting them in with the drunks. And we did that.  Then we got an old man from the Methodist Church to remodel a house  32  Finchum  Lincoln  Abraham  Lincoln  Abraham  Lincoln  Finchum  Lincoln  Finchum  Lincoln  Abraham  Finchum  for a girls    shelter that got the girls in off the street when they couldn   t  live at home. And they had a house mother. We only had one girl that  was completely unruly. The rest of them were all delighted to have a  place to stay.  Sure. You   ve done a lot of good. Do you have any orange in your closet?  OSU orange?  I do have one. I have a dress and I have a t-shirt. They gave me caps and  t-shirts and oh    I am overcome at the goodness of people, really.   Ruth pulls out a white pom-pom. It has a switch that makes it light up   Oh, this came from Oklahoma  I haven   t told you about the friend I  have who still lives in Oklahoma City. She came to visit the other day  and says the celebration for Oklahoma  Oklahoma   s Centennial in 2007   was at the same time my birthday was.  It   s got lights in it.  She brought this from Oklahoma.  Ruth pulls out a small Oklahoma  flag   She has friends from all over the world.  She  the friend  said in the observation of things they had people that  were over one hundred years old to eat lunch or something and there  were a mob of them   This is the Oklahoma flag.  See she spent most the afternoon telling me about it. She   s the daughter  of a woman I   ve known here for a long time.  So you   ve got people you know all over the country.  And this woman   s daughter graduated at SMU  Southern Methodist  University , where one of my great-grandchildren graduated. And she  worked a lot for people that are advertising various things like  Budweiser, and all that sort of thing. She would go in and set it up, set  up an exhibit. Now she is working in Arizona on the Super Bowl place.  You know the Super Bowl is going to be in Arizona this year.  She   s a big football fan.  You   re a big football fan?  33  Lincoln  Finchum  Abraham  Finchum  Lincoln  Finchum  Lincoln  Finchum  Lincoln  Finchum  Lincoln  Finchum  Abraham  Lincoln  Finchum  Yes, I love football. But you know, I get interested in football and  baseball both. My caretakers and I listen to the football games. And the  basketball shenanigans. We were just tickled to death when Arkansas  beat LSU  Louisiana State University . LSU beat Tennessee last night.  I know, that wasn   t good.  Did you  referring to Finchum  graduate from Tennessee?  I graduated from Tennessee so that was not a good game.  How long ago did you graduate?  1990.  Well, did you ever know Carol Kingsborough?  No, doesn   t sound familiar.  Kingsborough is an unusual name.  It is.  She  Lydia   s daughter, Carol Kingsborough  has four children now. She  wanted four little ones. And she   s got them. And they are cute. Smart as  than a whip.  Oh, one of my women who work for me kept two little children, a boy  and a girl. One of their names was Treasure and the other was  something. And this three year old learned the Lord   s Prayer and the  Twenty-Third Psalm. He just rattled them off to me. Of course the little  girl learned them too, but she was five. Isn   t that something?  That   s something. It is.  And Mother   s helped out a lot. She donated to the Arkansas Community  Foundation. And Mother instigated having scholarships from the interest  earned from her money  to go to Ferncliff Presbyterian Camp , so she  got two of the children of her caretakers to go to camp for a week with  her interest money. Thank you notes from them are just daring   a ten  year old and twelve year old? Was that it mother?  The twelve year old wrote a great long letter, and he had so much fun.  At the end he wrote said P.S. Can I go back next year?  Well you continue to touch a lot of lives.  34  Lincoln  Finchum  Lincoln  Abraham  Lincoln  Finchum  Lincoln  Abraham  Lincoln  Finchum  Lincoln  Abraham  Lincoln  Well, it   s so much fun. I enjoy it.  I can tell you enjoy it.  I do. The Lord has been so good to me. I couldn   t have done all this if he  hadn   t helped me. He   s the light in my life. We have a wonderful  preacher, he is so good. What was he talking about this morning, Lucy?  He talked about when time is going to end and they asked Jesus when it  was going to end, he says,    I don   t know.    You wouldn   t think he would  answer that would you? But he says,    Nobody knows but God.    It was  fantastic. He is so well read and so himself. He   s as big as the side of a  house (Laughs), six feet four and    whew  And he coaches Little League  baseball and my grandson works with him. They have a lot of fun  together.  He   s the rheumatologist  Jim Abraham, Lucy   s son .  The one   s that a rheumatologist has three little boys.  You   ve got a good memory to keep up with all those.  Whew  (Laughs) And when I begin to add all the Dan   s and Dean   s and  the like it   s hard to keep them all separated.  Mother, tell her about the word puzzles you do everyday.  Oh, I do the word Jumbles. Do you have Jumbles in the Oklahoman?  Scrambled letters to make words   you surely do that. Well, we do them  every morning. That   s why I take the paper. I can   t read it   I have the  girls  caretakers  read it to me, though. We read the Bible every  morning.  And you figure them out every day?  Yes, well, occasionally we   ll miss one. We can   t find an answer to it. Or  I can   t find it with the one I have in the morning and the one at night will  come and she can get it. (Laughs) We just have a whole house of it  going. All interested in the same thing.  Her caretaker reads the Bible to her everyday and her devotional. They  use the Upper Room. That   s just part of her routine.  My daughter in Tennessee joined the Methodist Church because it was  expedient. The Presbyterian Church was a long way away from her. So  they wanted it to be a neighborhood thing. I didn   t cry too much when  35  Abraham  Lincoln  Finchum  Lincoln  Lincoln  Finchum  Lincoln  Finchum  Lincoln  she joined the Methodist Church, I thought that was real nice. Now that  church is around 5,000.  My son, Bob, is going to baptize his baby next Sunday in that church.  We can get along with Methodist   s a little, can   t we?  Yes. I was rocked in a Methodist cradle. When we lived in Batesville,  Arkansas, which is a college town. That   s another thing that helped me  bring up my kids in a right way. They all might be mean as the dickens  during the week but on a Sunday they all went to church. And that was  due to atmosphere. It was called Arkansas College, but they   ve changed  the name of it since. Lucy, show them the Lyon College blanket. It   s the  people I   ve met who have made my life so enriched. Now this Frank  Lyon, he   s a wonderful person in our church. He and his wife got  married and lived in Kansas City and they tithed. Everything he touched  after that went to money. He owned a furniture store and the Coca-Cola  company here and several banks   he just had everything. And he and I  and another real good lawyer here who our church taught the  intermediate Sunday school class at Second Presbyterian Church. We  had a ball. That was more fun to work with those wonderful men. And  then going to New York and meeting all those people there. Do you  know anything about Guidepost the magazine?
