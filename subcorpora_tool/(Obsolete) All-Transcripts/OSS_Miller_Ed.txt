 Gill. Today is September 8, 2009. I   m visiting with Ed  Miller on the Oklahoma State University Campus in Stillwater,  Oklahoma. This interview is for the O-STATE Stories Project of the  Oklahoma Oral History Research Program. Ed, I know you   re busy. I  appreciate your taking time to come by and visit with us today.  Well, this is a real pleasure, really.  Why don   t we start with the beginning? Can you tell me a little bit about  where you grew up, a little bit about your early life, your family?  Okay, well I grew up in Des Moines, Iowa   really first-generation off of  a farm. My dad was a physician and my mom was a bookkeeper and a  housewife. I had a brother and a sister and, like I say, grew up in town. I  had a lot of relatives out on the farm and some of my early reflections  are being dropped off at the farm for summer when my parents would  like go on a vacation or something like that. I   d be dropped off at the  farm. So I   ve got real good memories of Uncle Art and Aunt Genevieve  and riding on the back of some the workhorses and things like that back  in Iowa.  I ended up going to Iowa State University which, of course, is another  great land-grant university. I got degrees in forestry and soil science     got really interested in soil science, had a great professor up there,  Wayne Scholtes. Then, got my PhD in water resources, hydrology,  primarily through the Ag-Engineering Department up there. I stayed at  one university and by the time I graduated, I had a wife and small family  of three kids. We shipped off and the first job was with the university.  So all three of your degrees, bachelor   s, master   s, PhD, are from Iowa  State?  5  Miller  Gill  Miller  Yes, I just kept changing departments and colleges but all three degrees  were from one university.  Can you share a little bit about your career before you come to  Oklahoma State?  Sure. My first job, I don   t know if you recall but times were pretty tough  in 1973 when I got my PhD, not too dissimilar from these days when  new college graduates, particularly in higher ed  education  are looking  for positions   professor positions had a tough time finding jobs. I can  remember I had two job offers. One was the University of Alaska in  Fairbanks and the other one was Stephen F. Austin State University in  East Texas with their forestry school. I remember that particularly  because the folks from the University of Alaska said everything they  could to discourage me from taking their job. They said,    You know  you   ve got a wife and young kids and Fairbanks is a tough place to live  with a young family.    At any rate, I took the job in Texas and taught  there for two years.  Weyerhaeuser Company then was looking for someone with,  interestingly enough, soils background, forestry background, water and  water quality background and that was the ticket for me. I   d been a  schoolboy for most of my life. So I thought,    Gee, what an opportunity  to go to work for Weyerhaeuser Company in their research group out of  Hot Springs, Arkansas.    So I went to work for Weyerhaeuser Company  as a soil scientist, forest hydrologist and worked for them for about  eleven years. Gee, it was really an exciting job. I did a lot of work as the  Water Quality Act, if you recall, water quality was a big, big issue back  in the seventies. Lots of pressure on the forest industry with respect to  water quality, so I did a lot of work with Weyerhaeuser Company in  research and reading applications of forestry practices and the effects of  forestry practices on water quality. I had an opportunity to manage their  southern soil survey, as well. Weyerhaeuser was a very progressive  company and all of their forest lands were mapped, all the soils were  mapped to help them with their prescriptions of forestry practices. Those  were the two jobs primarily that I had with Weyerhaeuser Company was  heading up their soil survey and working on their forest practices out in  the field to maintain high levels of water quality.  Then I had an opportunity to come to Oklahoma State as a forest  hydrologist. There were two people here who really were of interest to  me. One was Tom Haan and the other one was Bruce Wilson. Tom Haan  was in Biosystems and Ag-Engineering and he was a member of the  National Academy of Sciences and really probably one of the top  statisticians in hydrology in the country. After ten years, twelve years  with Weyerhaeuser Company, I was needing some kind of retreading     6  Gill  Miller  Gill  Miller  some scientific retreading. It was a great opportunity for me. I came over  here to the University to do teaching and to do research in, of all things,  forestry and water quality and to work with Tom Haan and Bruce  Wilson in biosystems and ag-engineering and kind of get my math and  my statistics back up to speed. So that was exciting and Weyerhaeuser  continued to fund me to do their research across the South, so it was a  great opportunity for me to have a faculty position, continue to enjoy the  support of Weyerhaeuser Company for research and then to work under  Tom Haan and with Bruce Wilson.  Things changed then. I really ramped up a research program for two or  three years and then I got drafted to be the interim department head in  Forestry. That turned into a permanent position, so I ended up being the  Forestry Department head for about ten years. I spent the first three  years kind of ramping up my research, the next three or four years kind  of ramping down my research and becoming a full-time administrator  for the Forestry Department.  Ed, is there a story about how you got to Oklahoma State? Did the  University contact you   ?  Yes, they had a position and I had actually done a little bit of teaching.  In my work with Weyerhaeuser Company, we developed a lot of  cooperative research projects, so some of my cooperative research was  actually with Oklahoma State because some of my water quality work  was in southeast Oklahoma. That was how the connection with  Oklahoma State was initiated, even before the position came open here.  It was sort of a natural progression of things. It really worked out  extremely well.  Then, the position as Associate Dean for Academic Programs  in the  College of Agricultural Sciences and Natural Resources  came open.  Paul Hummer, who had been the associate for seventeen years, actually,  was getting ready to retire, so they opened the position. I really enjoyed  teaching; I really enjoyed working with the students over the years that I  was a faculty member. And I continued to teach as a department head, so  teaching and inspiring and mentoring students just really excited me, so  I applied to become the associate dean and lo and behold, surprised me  as much maybe as everyone else, got the position.  Who was dean then?  Dr. Browning. Charles Browning was dean at that time. Quite a little  interesting anecdote was when Nancy and I first moved to Stillwater, we  moved into the home of Randall Jones. Randall had been Associate  Dean for Academic Programs for the College of Agriculture. So I moved  7  Gill  Miller  Gill  Miller  Gill  Miller  in, I was a new assistant/associate professor, kind of right on the  borderline there. Of course, we had no clue that in time I would become  the Associate Dean for the College of Agriculture. So our first home  here was Randall Jones   s house. He and his wife moved out, we moved  in, then some years later I became Associate Dean for Academic  Programs.  He was a great gentleman, really a legend in running this college.  Yes, Randall Jones is extremely well-thought of, just a real gentleman.  Even today we enjoy scholarship support from his son through an  endowment that he and his wife set up for the college.  What were your first impressions of Oklahoma State, of the department,  the college?  My first impression really was built around the Forestry Department and  then working with Tom Haan, so I was pretty impressed. I grew up on  the Great Plains, so for a forester to return to the Great Plains was not  too odd. Most foresters who graduate, I would say, from Oklahoma State  or from Iowa State or any of the forestry schools that are out on the  Plains, most of those kids want to go to work out in the deep woods  somewhere. I certainly had that dream as an undergraduate. But times  change and opportunities present themselves so it was a good  opportunity to come back here, to maintain the research with  Weyerhaeuser, to have a faculty position, so I was just very, very happy  to get this position at Oklahoma State. Oklahoma State was established  some years after Iowa State and the construct of the entire university  was very much along the lines of the construct of Iowa State University.  Even the Forestry Department here at Oklahoma State had programs that  were quite similar. People here at Oklahoma State when they established  the Forestry Department brought a lot of information and history from  Iowa State   s forestry program and implemented those things here  because Iowa State had had a good forestry program. The department  was similar, the curriculum was similar, the students   conservative,  hard-working, very practical kids, just like back in Iowa. So it was a fit.  You   ve describe several capacities that you   ve served through the years.  How did you become involved in OSU   s Scholar Development and  Recognition Program?  Well, really I think as a department head in Forestry, of course, we  always work very hard to develop scholarships and to recognize students  who are outstanding. But that was really in a limited context. I mean I  was really thinking within my discipline and students within that  forestry arena. When I became Associate Dean, I really needed to  8  Gill  Miller  expand that thinking and to really represent the college as much as  possible. I think whenever you get promoted internally, you don   t want  to get a divorce, necessarily, from your discipline, but it   s pretty  important to pick up the banner of the organization you   re working for,  that bigger picture. Of course, here at Oklahoma State, we have  wonderful donors, wonderful alumni. We   ve always had an excellent  scholarship program that is the financial support for students. We   ve  always had good programs for recognition of students in the college,  who have excelled   the top student in Ag-Econ or the top students in  Animal Science or the top students in Agricultural Education, so we   ve  always had that recognition.  But I would say at the university level, really the whole idea and concept  of scholar development is recognizing the top students. It was certainly  initiated before I became Associate Dean but it was still somewhat of a  fledgling program, I would say, at the university level. It was developing  and it had gotten some traction and it was moving ahead. Then, I became  Associate Dean and it presented some very nice opportunities for the  college, in recognizing the outstanding students that we had, to really  buy into that.  Picking up on your comment about fledgling and kind of moving into  maturity, what were some of your thoughts and concerns on the program  early on?  I don   t know that I would say that I had any concerns. I think it was  more of a learning process. Most faculty and department heads are not  necessarily aware of some of the national level scholarships and scholar  recognition programs that are available. Then, I would say among the  faculty that there might be some concerns because faculty may feel like  one student or two or three students receiving such attention and awards  detracts from the larger group of students that we serve. So that would  be a concern. There   s the whole issue of just learning about these  programs, learning about how they would benefit students and thinking a  little bit about how such programs could benefit the college and our  various academic departments that I think gave me cause for thought and  not necessarily concern but a little bit of caution. But, of course, I think  recognition at the university level of how important these programs are  caught on pretty fast. It wasn   t too difficult for this college to buy in. We  had always had through the Alumni Association recognition of top-ten  seniors  and  for a long time, had recognition programs for outstanding  freshman. I think moving from outstanding students at the university  level to outstanding students at the national level was a logical and a real  positive progression of thinking   kind of a broadening of our thinking,  if you will.  9  Gill  Miller  Gill  Miller  Gill  Can you describe a little bit of your participation, how you participated  in the program initially and how it has evolved?  Right, well I think really initially, the Office of Scholar Development,  Bob Graalman   s outfit, recognized some outstanding students in our  college. That probably happened before I recognized Bob Graalman   s  office and the role that they could play. It was a little bit of a two-way  street. I had participated in recognition of outstanding seniors and things  like that, outstanding freshman. Bob Graalman and his office started to  work with some of these outstanding freshmen because they were trying  to develop these students early on to see if they couldn   t elevate  themselves to this national level of recognition. In working with  freshmen and then Bob having identified a couple of outstanding  students in our college   which seemed like,    If I   m going to be the  associate dean and have an influence on what   s happening around here, I  better get on board.    I can   t say that I was necessarily the big leader here  but it didn   t take me very long to recognize how valuable this could be  for our students and for the college as well as for OSU.  I know Bob had described to me earlier some of the things they ask the  faculty to do in terms of helping with mock interviews, preparation   are  there some things you do specifically? Have you participated in those  ways?  Yes, we   ve done quite a bit of that. Those are the formal things that we  do. I really think, to me, the real story at the college level is the early  identification of students who have the potential. That   s an informal  process, it   s not a formal process. And we have a big advantage in this  college because we advise all our students with faculty. Faculty  members are engaged from the time a student walks in our doors as a  freshman. So we have a big advantage in terms of taking a look at each  student as they sit down and talk to us and talk about their dreams and  aspirations, taking a look at their grades every semester to see how  they   re performing academically. I think that the most important  component that our college adds to this overall process is the early  identification and stimulating the students to realize their potential.  Then, we work with Bob Graalman   s office. So to me, yes, I have been  involved in the mock interviews and I have helped students write their  policy statements or their statement of purpose or their goals and  aspirations and have really enjoyed that process as you watch the  students develop. But I think if we do anything really well in this  college, it   s that early identification process. That   s the key.  Picking up on your comments about faculty helping identify and working  with the students, I assume that you   ve been able to engage several, if I  can remember, in the process. In addition to yourself, could you identify  10  Miller  Gill  Miller  Gill  Miller  some of the individuals here in the college that helped identify and work  with scholars?  Yes. Really, if we go back, when I took this job Wes Holley was still our  assistant dean. Wes worked under Paul Hummer. Wes was a real pied  piper for students. He loved students and they loved him. He taught our  introductory course, our introduction to agriculture course here in our  college. Wes was one of the first ones who began to identify these  students as they went through the orientation course. Then, we would  kind of notify the faculty in the various departments and say,    Help us to  see who are the outstanding students in Ag-Econ? Who are the  outstanding students in Animal Science? Who are the outstanding  students in Biochemistry? Let   s get their names. Let   s talk to them.    Bob  Graalman   s office then provides some very nice early meetings with  freshmen and sophomores, a meeting where we simply discuss the  opportunities that are available through Scholar Development to see  whether the sparkle catches fire with some of these students. So I would  have to credit Wes, to tell you the truth.  Wes and I initiated our Freshmen in Transition  program  and you might  have heard about our living learning community. The Freshmen in  Transition, we really aren   t targeting what I would call the    high-rollers,     but students who want to get in that program are generally  students who are motivated, so through the Freshmen in Transition  program, there was another way that we connected to students who had  high potential. Then, I would have to say that the history of our students  with 4-H and FFA  Future Farmers of America  has had a large  influence on our ability to identify students and students. I don   t know if  I call it ability, or students recognizing their potential. A lot of our early  success stories in Scholar Development were students who had a history  in 4-H and FFA.  They sort of self-identified themselves previously, too.  Yes, and they had high aspirations. I think they came from small towns  like Slapout and towns like that, but they recognized their potential. Our  students came to us   certainly a large group of them came to us  knowing there was not a relationship between the size of your town and  your IQ. That   s pretty important.  Ed, why is it and how is it so important to get involvement of faculty in  the scholar identification and development process?  I think students around the world like to be cared for. They like to know  someone is paying attention to them and cares for them. Even if a  student comes in here with good leadership history, like through 4-H or  11  Gill  Miller  FFA, they still need to be supported. They still need to be inspired to do  special things. In particular, I think with national scholarships like the  Udall or the Truman or the Marshall, it takes some time for these  students to develop.  There are really two areas, I think, that are probably key for faculty, in  addition to just the mentoring   identification and bringing the students  in and pumping them up.    You have the potential. You can do great  things. You should have the highest aspirations because you can do great  things.    So that   s number one. But the other two things probably are  getting some of these students, after they recognize their potential, to  really broaden their education. Many of our programs in agriculture are  fairly narrow. For a student to excel in some of these national  scholarship programs, they have to do something over and above the  standard cookie-cutter degree program. The second thing would be  faculty along with Bob Graalman   s office, inspiring students to do things  in terms of academics or extracurricular activities that they would not  have done otherwise.  Then probably the third thing has been   a lot of our faculty get engaged  with our undergraduate students in research projects. Sometimes these  start like a student comes into your office and says,    I need a part-time  job. I need to earn a little money. I   d like to work five or ten hours a  week. Boy, if I had a job here in your department where I could go to  class, work a little, go to class, work a little, that   d be great.    So you  take an outstanding student, maybe they need a little bit of extra  financial support, maybe they start working in your lab or maybe they  start working on some of your data if you   re in Ag-Econ; they get a little  interested in research, pretty soon, what do you know? They just really  bloom. I would say that a lot of our faculty get students engaged in  research early on because the Scholar Development Program has relied  on our Freshman Research Scholars program and our Wentz Research  Scholars program here at Oklahoma State.  Ed, do you mind me interrupting? I was going to ask you, the Wentz   endowment  has refocused a lot of its  financial support to,  instead of  student jobs, to student research. Has that been beneficial?  Oh, absolutely. And I would think that with respect to freshman  research, a lot of the students   let   s put it in a real positive way. The  students in our college have an easier time locating a faculty person who  will mentor them in an undergraduate research project because they start  right out day one with a faculty member as an advisor. And that faculty  member will lead them to another faculty member who might be willing  to mentor them in an undergraduate research project. Or find them a job  which leads into a research project of some kind. I think our students  12  Gill  Miller  Gill  Miller  have had a little bit of an advantage with that early relationship with a  faculty member that pumps them up, gets them broadening their  education and then really getting them engaged in some undergraduate  research, which seems to be kind of a key component in this whole  Scholar Development Program.  I think you   ve outlined well the reasons for, steps and process for,  engaging a student, but in that final process where you   re really  grooming them to prepare them for a specific  scholarship  (a Gates,  Rhodes, Truman) how does faculty engage at that point? What steps can  you do to help in that area?  Now, you   re talking about really those final steps of preparing a paper or  conducting research and presenting the results. Or perhaps more  importantly, it   s helping the students develop a sense of purpose and  being able to write and to express that sense of purpose; establishing or  creating a philosophy, if you will. I think we found that many of our  scholars are a little more advanced in terms of developing a personal  philosophy of life, or direction or purpose. I think the faculty plays a big  role in letting students bounce ideas back and forth so they can develop  that. We have a big debate over whether faculty can really stimulate or  speed up the process of maturing. These are things that happen to us  through time, but for some of us, it didn   t happen until we were thirty  years old. (Laughter) What we   re trying to do, we   re trying to get  students who are twenty years old and twenty-one years old to examine  their lives and to think about their purpose and their direction and  establish a philosophy. How much can a faculty member stimulate a  student to mature more quickly, if you will, so they can do that and quite  honestly, impress a committee at the national level that they truly are  outstanding students and scholars?  Do you and some of the other faculty members actually help with some  of the mock interviews that you do?  Absolutely. We help with the mock interviews, we help a lot with the  writing and the students are pretty much in shock when they submit the  first draft of a policy statement or a philosophy statement and it comes  back all red. Then, they submit it again and it goes back all red and they  submit it again. About the sixth or seventh time, I think they   re thinking,     Oh, my gosh, what have I gotten myself into?    I would have to say at  that point, I   ve gotten involved in the writing, for example, on a couple  of rounds but I have to give Bob Graalman and his office and the people  that he   s brought together, say out of the English Department and those  on the liberal side of campus that can really take that a step further. I   m  not a great writer; I do okay. It really takes some people with expertise  in the whole area of writing to help them. Bob has a done a great job of  13  Gill  Miller  Gill  Miller  Gill  Miller  bringing some of those people together to help these students.  You mentioned earlier students broadening themselves just beyond their  curriculum, their major area. Has that been sort of a shift for this  college, for those kinds of students, to encourage them to step out and  take some courses in social sciences and in English and other areas?  I think our students are pretty practical-minded and they   re looking for  efficiency. Efficiency says,    I take the courses I need to take, I get out of  here and I get a job.    Right? You sit down with a student and you say,     Maybe, you ought to take an extra course in literature or maybe you  ought to take an extra course in philosophy. Have you thought about  Bob Graalman   s Windows to the World course? Have you done an  international program? Have you gone overseas and done some  international work at all?       Gosh, that   s going to take me an extra  semester or two if I do that.       Well, of course I   m sixty-four. An extra  semester or two? Big deal.    But when you   re twenty and twenty-one  years old, you   re in a hurry. You want to get finished. I think to some  extent, we have a little bit of a struggle to get students to slow down and  to broaden themselves. I don   t think it   s so much that our students are  unwilling but they are looking for, and their parents are looking for a  certain amount of efficiency here. Another semester, another tuition bill,  et cetera, et cetera. But if you think about the long term impacts, the long  term rewards, they are phenomenal. I would have to say (and I know that  Bob Graalman would probably say the same thing) of course for all the  students that apply and do the work, only a few of them are successful at  the top level. So another part of the developmental process is, I think,  willingness to invest yourself and do all this hard work knowing darn  well you might fail.  In your college   and I can say this for you   the College of Agricultural  Sciences and Natural Resources has really had a disproportionate  number of winners of national scholars competition.  We   ve been very lucky.  Could you share some statistics? I   m trying to recall how many in some  of the areas and perhaps a little bit about some of the awards that the  students have won out of the college.  I can   t give you the total figure, I wish I could. But let me talk about a  couple of specific examples. We had a wonderful run of Truman  Scholars which really resulted in OSU   not in total, but it certainly was  an important aspect of OSU becoming a Truman Scholar Institution.  That started with Shannon Ferrell who came up through the 4-H system,  outstanding student, a bright young man, Ag-Econ major, interested in  14  Gill  Miller  Pre-Law. Shannon was a mature thinker,  had an  excellent vocabulary,  a broad thinker, well-educated, more broadly than just in his discipline;  good leadership skills, good service attitude. He became one of our first  Trumans. He may not have been the first Truman out of this college, but  he was one of the first of a run. Then, Chris Stephens who was right in  there with Shannon became a Truman Scholar. Shannon came up  through the FFA organization;  his  parents were both Ag teachers.  Chris then applied for and became a Truman Scholar   went through this  whole process of development, became a Truman Scholar  and  later  became a Marshall Scholar. Chris went on and was head of his class at  Yale Law School after doing work at Cambridge.  This is Shannon?  Chris. Shannon went on to law school down at OCU  Oklahoma City  University . Then, we had Kent Gardner and anybody who   gosh, you  could do a whole history on the Gardner family and the way all those  kids went through the College of Agriculture. Kent Gardner, similar  path, different personality certainly than Chris and Shannon, but same  process; identified by faculty, broadened his thinking, broadened his  portfolio and applied for and was successful in the Truman Scholarship.  Then we had a   little interesting story, Julia Arntz. Julia was actually  one of our first Environmental Science students. Just a little anecdote  about Julia; her interest area was in agriculture and natural resources  policy. There are two or three faculty in Ag Econ who are interested in  that area. That   s really their area of specialization. I recall that when  Julia first came to us, the Ag Econ faculty commiserated and argued a  little about really whether they ought to be using their Ag Econ  scholarship money to support an Environmental Science student, even  though she was interested in environmental and ag policy. Well, they  finally decided that she   s an excellent student and she   s well-qualified,  we   re advising her in our department even though she   s not strictly an  Ag Econ student. They supported Julia and really embraced her. Julia  applied for and was successful and became a Truman Scholar. Then the  faces lit up; thank goodness the Ag Econ Department decided to make  that investment in Julia and really embrace her as one of their students.  She chose an Ag Econ faculty member as her mentor for the Truman.  We had those four. We had Shannon Ferrell, Chris Stephens, Kent  Gardner and Julia Arntz. Four Truman Scholars, just    bing, bing, bing,  bing.    A great success story.  We have sort of a similar story right now with our Udall Scholars, the  Morris K. Udall group.  We  had two students who were just  outstanding. One was Sara Jane Smallwood and the other one, Cortney  Timmons. Of course, Cortney Timmons is sort of famous on our  15  Gill  Miller  campus. Sara Jane and Cortney applied for the Udall Scholarship in the  same year, mentored by different faculty. Sara Jane was an Ag  Communications major, Cortney a Biosystems/Ag Engineering major.  Cortney really gets to be claimed by two colleges   the College of  Engineering and College of Agriculture, which is a good thing. That   s a  great thing. That   s a great program that   s supported by both the colleges  and both colleges can take a lot of credit for helping to nurture Cortney  along. So here   s these two young women, they both apply for the Udall  and lo and behold, they both win the Morris K. Udall Scholarship   two  out of Oklahoma State University in the same year.  Those two young women identified another student, Savannah Smith, an  Environmental Science student. So we   ve got an Ag Comm unications   student and a Biosystems/Ag Engineering student identified another  student, Savannah Smith. They said,    Savannah, you   ve got all the  qualities of someone who could apply for and win one of these Udall  Scholarships.    They got Savannah all pumped up and prepped and  Savannah had the horsepower. She had the engine to do it. So Savannah  applied the next year for an Udall Scholarship and won the Udall.  Sara Jane and Cortney and Savannah identified another student the next  year, Jessie Lay, a Biosystems-Ag Engineering student. They got Jessie  involved in some of the environmental activities here on campus,  recycling and some things like that that they had used as an entr  e to the  Udall Scholarship.  They  got Jessie pumped up and Jessie then applied  for and   this year   won a Morris K. Udall Scholarship. We   ve got a  poster here floating around the college someplace of these four young  women, all of whom became Udall Scholars and who mentored one  another. That   s probably one of the things that I didn   t mention in terms  of the overall scholar development in this college that probably is a  strength. And that is that so many of our students support one another  and identify one another and mentor one another and really celebrate   I  think Cortney and Sara Jane got just as much joy out of seeing Savannah  get the Udall as they did when they got it themselves. That   s pretty  special.  In what ways has the program enriched the lives of the students while  they are doing it? And when I say that, scholarship winners and non-scholarship  winners have been in the program.  Yes, they really have. That   s perhaps an interesting story, too. I   ve got  one good story about a non-winner that I   ll relate to you. There are a  couple of things that we have to recognize. So few students are going to  get this, but we tell our new freshman when they enroll   and we  reiterate this as students go through their programs   that for every one  of the students that gets one of these scholarships, it increases the value  16  of every single degree that every student gets from this college. That is,  the value   it   s like stock in a company   the value of the stock in a  company, which is your degree that you get from this college. The value  of that stock goes up every time one of these students brings that level of  recognition to this college, because these students achieve things  nationally. They achieve recognition nationally; that brings recognition  of the quality here at Oklahoma State and in the College of Ag Sciences  and Natural Resources. Even though every student doesn   t get one of  these, and a lot apply and a lot don   t get it, still the value of every single  degree given out of the college is increased, in my opinion, because of  those who try and because of those who succeed. I think that   s really  important to recognize. The successes of the stories  of those  who  attained this level, in terms of either graduate education or the things  they do in their lives, are pretty outstanding.  In terms of, maybe, we won   t call them the failures, but those who really  don   t quite get there, I think again, I   d have to refer back to Bob  Graalman and Bob Graalman may use this individual as one of the  examples as one who didn   t make it. But that would be the example of  Bart Fischer, who was a graduate of our college. Bart was an applicant  for the Truman, he was an applicant for the Marshall and he was an  applicant for the Gates.  He  just didn   t quite make it each time. Just, in  our opinion, by a hair. But he just didn   t quite make it. Gosh, to go back  to a student and say,    The process was valuable. Think of the growth  you had through this process. (Laughter) Think of how much this is  going to benefit you in the future.    Gosh, when you just didn   t get it, I  don   t know how much   a whole lot of that kind of sad doesn   t go very  far, because you   re hurting when you   ve put out that much time into one  of these applications and you don   t get there. I would say Bart is an  example of a student who tried and tried. There   s a certain amount of  luck involved in getting the right committee at the right time, with the  right message. But Bart would be an example of a student who really  tried and tried and didn   t quite make it but was an outstanding student. I  think his overall development was fantastic. We in fact did locate some  scholarship money for Bart to go to Cambridge following his  undergraduate work. And Bart right now is   actually he worked for  GAO  Government Accountability Office  in Washington, D.C. for a  number of years and he   s now down at Texas A M working on a PhD. I  know Bart is looking at an academic career on down the line sometime.  Then, Shannon Ferrell. Shannon Ferrell, who was obviously one of our  first Truman winners is now a faculty member specializing in Ag and  Natural Resources Law, right here in our own department of Ag-Econ.  It   s great to have Shannon around to help mentor these students. You  talk about someone who is willing to identify and really push some of  these freshmen along   you   ve got a guy like Shannon Ferrell around,  17  Gill  Miller  Gill  Miller  Gill  Miller  what an opportunity for our students to have Shannon here to mentor  them.  Ed, as you said, just a small number of a much larger group that are  going to get those kinds of awards. What benefits do students receive  that participate in the program, like Bart  and  others, that don   t quite  make it? What benefits do you think they get out of it?  I think, and I   m a prime example (this we talked about a little bit earlier)  all of us, sooner or later (hopefully most of us sooner or later) will  develop a philosophy of life or an understanding of the importance of  service, or a sense of direction to our lives. Some of us kind of stumble  on it by mistake. But it happens. It happens, hopefully, before we   re  thirty or forty years old. Those students who go through the process of  applying for one of these scholarships, they are forced, if you will     willingly, but they are forced to write and to think about their  philosophy; to write and to think about service to others; to write and to  think about the impact that they might have on society on down the line.  That has to have a positive impact on these students. So this combination  of 4-H and FFA and the things that our college does, the lifetime  relationships with faculty that develop through the mentoring process.  Then, the process of a student really sitting down and examining their  lives   examining how they   re going to take their academic work and  apply it to something meaningful; win or lose you have got that in your  hip pocket.  It   s really a win-win, isn   t it?  Yes, absolutely.  Ed, what do you feel personally, from your experience, should be the  goals of the Scholar Development and Recognition Program? Within the  college  and  university-wide, what should be the goals?  I think one of the goals, of course, is to help students understand their  potential. I think every student needs that, particularly students from  here in Oklahoma need to really understand that there really are very  few limits. We self-limit ourselves. I always tell the students,    Have you  ever tried to fill up a bottle when the lid is on it? It   s really hard to get  that water in that bottle when the lid is on it.    Our real job, I think,  through academic programs is to kind of get the lids off, so we can fill  them up. I think that these kinds of programs help take the lid off, if you  will. You   ve got to open yourself up in order to fill your brain up or fill  your heart up or fill your soul up with these kinds of ideas. We   re trying  to get those caps off the bottles.  18  Gill  Miller  Gill  Miller  These students influence one another. We talk about the mentoring that  goes on, students helping students, which is sort of our little jingle this  year is    students helping students.    These students network and they talk  to one another. We have freshmen who come in and say,    You know,  that guy Bart Fischer who came from Frederick, Oklahoma, I come from  that area, I come from down in Frederick and we know the Fischer  family. I   d sure like to do some of the things that Bart Fischer did.    Or  someone who comes from out in Western Oklahoma and says,    You  know that Gardner family? All those kids that went through OSU; I   d  really like to do something at the caliber that Kent Gardner did.     I think it stimulates a lot larger group. If our goal was just to get these  few scholars through this program so that Oklahoma State can be  recognized, I think we   d really have been missing the boat. Our goal is  to improve the value of the degrees of everybody who graduates here.  Our job is to get the lids off the bottles and to have these students help  stimulate one another to develop lifetime relationships between faculty  and students   mentoring relationships between faculty and students to  help these students move on and succeed. Those are the bigger, broader  goals, I think, that the Scholar Development program really helps along.  I assume there are some synergies with your other academic programs  in the college. Can you describe how the Scholars Recognition Program  has meshed with other academic and recognition programs in the  college?  I think as we think about the programs that traditionally we   ve had in the  college   the recognition of outstanding seniors, in particular, boy, the  departments take great pride in that. The whole idea of scholar  development, it does get a little competitive. To say the Ag Econ  Department is not exceedingly proud of the number of Truman Scholars  they   ve had   oh my goodness. I think this has become, for a couple of  our departments, integral to what they do. Scholar development is not  the only thing going. They want to recognize all seniors, actually all  students at all levels, who excel in so many different ways. But the  Scholars Program has just become integral to that. It   s just one  component   as it should be. It   s not the only game in town for our  students.  You mentioned earlier that perhaps early on some faculty members were  a little bit concerned about just a small handful of people getting these  national recognitions as opposed to a larger pool of students who need  to be recognized and are being recognized. Is that still there a little bit?  I think it always is. That   s why I talk to freshmen about the importance  of celebrating those students but realizing that we all are helped when  19  Gill  Miller  one of those students achieves that. But that isn   t necessarily the goal for  every one of our students. Some of our students I identified   at the  beginning of our interview today, I talked a little bit about my  background. I went to Iowa State University. By the time I got my PhD,  I had a wife and three children, got married as an undergraduate, had to  work a lot of hours, was pretty much a shy and introverted type of  student. This type of thing was the furthest thing from my mind. But I  wouldn   t say that I was unsuccessful. There   s lots of ways to make an  impact. You don   t have to become a great scholar, or be a Truman  Scholar to make a great impact. It is inspiring, I think. I think for this  college, it is inspiring for all students to see that that   s one of the  possibilities. But there are so many other ways that students can  contribute; in terms of helping each other, leadership, service to the  community, helping their families, just kind of the overall package. We  do want to recognize that there are students who have other  responsibilities, students who have other goals and aspirations. There are  many ways to achieve the goals you want to achieve. This is one of  them; but it   s an important one.  Speaking of national recognition, how important to the Scholar  Development Program was Blaine Greteman   s being recognized as the  first Rhodes Scholar, in your mind?  That   s pretty spectacular. I guess Bob would be a better one to talk about  the Rhodes in particular. At some level, there   s a little bit of politics  involved in all of these things. That may be an area, but for him to have  gotten that award is pretty special.  Kyle Ensley is another student who   s achieved some really outstanding  recognition here at Oklahoma State University. My background is in  forestry, I worked for Weyerhaeuser Company for a number of years.  Kyle   s dad worked for Weyerhaeuser Company down in southeast  Oklahoma as a mill worker for Weyerhaeuser Company in southeast  Oklahoma.  It  didn   t seem to affect his IQ one bit. (Laughter) There   s  just great things that these students can do that just amaze you every  day. One of the things that is really fun to watch and that is, regardless  of their college, regardless of their hometown   whether they came out  of Tulsa or they came out of Slapout, or Wright City, Oklahoma, or  wherever they came from, these students network in an incredible way.  One of the fun things is to go to one of these recognition deals here on  campus and realize that   of course, you walk in the room first of all and  nobody recognizes you, you   re just the associate dean of the college.  (Laughter) But these students walk in the room and everybody knows  Cortney Timmons here, everybody knows Greteman, everybody knows  Kyle Ensley here. (Laughter) That   s pretty special. Across all the  colleges and across all the faculty and administrators, they know these  20  Gill  Miller  students and celebrate them.  The other fun thing is that most of these students, almost down to the  very last one, they understand their capabilities. They understand what  they can do and they appreciate what they   ve achieved. Almost to an  individual, these people really live within themselves. Their egos are not  out of control. Cortney Timmons is probably the best example. She   s  just another student in so many respects. She   s pretty impressive though.  You stand her up in front of a big crowd to introduce Boone Pickens and  she just does it as smooth as glass, so relaxed. But one on one, she   s just  a regular student. She has a sense of humility. That   s pretty special to  see. It   s fun to see these students interact with each other. That   s another  really special aspect to this. That networking that they have, one with the  other, regardless of what direction they go, is pretty special. I know that  will last them a lifetime.  I   ll make a comment before you ask me another question. I think another  aspect that the students would not, at first, think about and maybe not  even the faculty. Certainly in the College of Agriculture, we hold on  pretty tightly to this land-grant philosophy   this land-grant mission if  you will. One aspect of that is to bring higher-education to everyday,  working class people. These students that we   re recognizing, they   re not  graduates of prep schools. Most of them are coming out of common   education ; some of the bigger cities, maybe, many of the small towns  here in Oklahoma. These aren   t kids who were groomed from the time  they were seven or eight years old to be outstanding scholars. I think the  recognition these students bring to themselves and to our institution is  sort of a vindication of the whole land-grant philosophy of bringing  these opportunities to everyday, working class people, not the people  who were born with a silver spoon in their mouth, necessarily.  I had the opportunity to interview Louis Blair, who had been executive  director of the Truman Scholarship program for many years. He alluded  to that, too. He used the example of Oklahoma State University and  before that K ansas  State, the land-grant universities, students that had  done exceptionally well in the recognition programs, particularly with  the Truman Scholar Recognition program. I think that   s sort of  vindication, what you   re saying as well.  It   s an important aspect and I don   t know that students would embrace  that as much because they   re not quite as keenly aware of   they   ve  heard    land-grant    because we   ve talked about it and they understand a  little bit about teaching, research and extension and how they fit  together. But they perhaps haven   t gone back and read the Morril Act  and understand what President Lincoln had in mind when he talked  about bringing higher ed really to the masses   to the common folks.  21  Gill  Miller  Gill  Miller  Gill  Miller  In your opinion, how has the Scholar Recognition Program evolved over  the years? You were a pretty early adapter, early on when you became  associate dean, which would have been about what year?  Oh gosh, I started this job in    99, so we   ve been around here for awhile.  The last ten-plus years. How have you seen it change and evolve since  you got involved with it to now?  We   re more sophisticated. I think the recognition of how all the pieces  fit together is just much, much better. Probably in the early days, we  kind of   I wouldn   t say we stumbled along but we weren   t too  sophisticated in how we found students who had this potential and then  how we developed them. I think we   re just much more methodical about  that now. That is, we   ve got ourselves organized to find students and to  make these opportunities available to them. Of course, things like  putting the Freshman Research Scholars together and the Wentz  program together and seeing how those components fit in and seeing  how faculty advisement and early mentoring, how that all fits in together  with scholar development. Then, of course, Bob Graalman has done  such a wonderful job of making sure always that it   s a university-wide  program; that it   s not focused on one college over another. The  evolution really has to do with becoming a little more sophisticated in  how we approach scholar development, I think.  Bob could really address much better how things have evolved  nationally. He   s tried to adjust, along with Louis Blair   s help, to the  evolution of programs nationally and how then we might adapt and  prepare ourselves as an institution and as colleges to that. That   s bigger  than me. That   s a different viewpoint than I have. My viewpoint is still  kind of focused here on the college with our students. Bob clearly  indicated that the competition nationally has gotten pretty keen. Lots  more schools are interested in developing their students and having their  students be recognized. They understand how important that is to their  institutions so the competition nationally is tough.  You partially answered this, but again, what do you think of the  strengths of our program here at Oklahoma State University from your  perspective of our Scholar Recognition Development Program?  Gosh, there are so many strengths and they really are the attributes of the  program. Early identification, that   s certainly a strength of the program.  I think celebrating Bob Graalman   of course, I keep mentioning Bob   s  name because I really see him as kind of the author and the vision for the  program. But I think that our college embraces this as well and that is  the recognition, not of the higher administration and their role in this or  22  Gill  Miller  Gill  the recognition of Bob   s office and his role in this; the real focus, if you  take a look at our Hall of Fame over in the Student Union, the Halligan  Hall of Fame over there, what level of recognition is given over there?  It   s the student and the faculty mentor. That   s whose pictures are up on  the board. It   s not the dean   s picture. I think at the University, we have a  tendency to defer   here   s the dean and an outstanding scholar or here   s  the president and an outstanding scholar. Well, guess what? They  showed up when the award was given. It was the faculty member who  really helped these students. It was the faculty member who helped the  student develop the philosophy and to write the paper and to give them  the mock interviews and things like that. I think I have to give our  Scholar Development Office a lot of credit for keeping the focus on the  relationship between the student and celebrating the student-faculty  relationship.  Then another key, I think, to the success is not getting so hung up on the  winners but letting those who didn   t achieve understand how important  it is   probably as much of blood, sweat and tears goes in to coming and  helping support those students who didn   t make it so that they don   t feel  like the rug has been pulled out or that the bottom dropped out from  under them. They are some of the best students you   ve got and they have  this feeling of failure for not having achieved the scholarship. So how do  you come in and say,    You know what? This was valuable. This is going  to pay huge dividends to you in the future.    And isn   t it interesting? I  think every day I discover things that happened, investments that people  made in my life, investments that people made in me; I had to be sixty-years  old before I realized the value of the investment that was made in  me when I was eighteen. So  for  these students, those things are going  to come in time. They   re going to understand the value of that  investment, even if they didn   t make the top scholarship.  Picking up and maybe rephrasing a little what you   re saying, two things  that you keep alluding to of interest and you may want to comment  further or not, is the investment that faculty have made in this program  (in understanding someone who might be listening to this tape). Faculty  are not getting an extra penny for this. I mean, the time and resources  they   re putting into it, the passion they   re putting into it, the hours  they   re putting into it.  Nope, not a dime. They do get a little bit of a reward and so    I think for  faculty, the rewards are immediate. A small immediate award is worth a  whole lot more than a big long-term award, perhaps, way out in the  future someplace. The success of the students and the pleasure of the  students is an awfully big reward.  In your mind, part of the genius and part of those strengths  of  that  23  Miller  Gill  program is that faculty engagement.  They didn   t pay an extra thousand bucks or five thousand or twenty  thousand to have your picture up next to a student over in the Halligan  Scholar   s Hall over there. But wow, every parent and future student and  other faculty look through there and they look at those pictures on the  wall and it   s like,    Wow, what a great investment those faculty made in  those students. Isn   t it great that those students recognize the value of the  contributions those faculty made in their life? Isn   t that just fantastic?     So yes, there wasn   t a lot of money. Now, let   s say the student gets a  Wentz undergraduate research scholarship as a part of this whole  process, just as an example, and a number of our top scholars have had  Wentz projects, not all but a number of them have. Well then, there   s a  little money to help support the research. Most of the money goes in the  pocket of the student as a scholarship but a little money goes to help  support the research   precious little, but a little. That   s a little bit of a  reward. We have a wonderful recognition program for the Wentz  Scholars and their mentors. The students and the faculty get to get up  and be recognized. There   s a reward. I think the non-monetary rewards  (laughter) have certainly helped in this whole process, because the  monetary awards are few and far between.  One of the things that a student can do as an undergraduate to really  enhance their opportunity, both for these scholarships and to enhance  their opportunities maybe for post-graduate studies, just to get a research  paper before they graduate as an undergraduate. The Freshman Research  Scholars Program, the Wentz Program, the Scholar Development  Program, sometimes these things lead to an undergraduate research  paper before the student graduates with their bachelor   s degree. If it   s  co-authored with their major professor and their mentor, there   s a pretty  nice feather in the cap. That eventually then goes on that annual  appraisal for that faculty member, the fact that they mentored a Wentz  Scholar and that there was a research paper perhaps that was published  in partnership with that student. So those do lead to some real, what I  would call, monetary awards but most of it is just the pure joy of seeing  the students succeed, I think.  Another strength that I think I   ve heard you allude to, Ed, is the  investment   and I like that you used that word many times and it   s very  appropriate   the investment that the college and the university and  faculty members have made in the lives of these students, not just about  winning the scholarships but as you said about their heart and their soul  and expanding their thinking about themselves and their potential. You  were talking about trying to get that lid off the bottle and pouring water  into the bottle. I hear you saying that that   s a real strength of the  program here at Oklahoma State University.  24  Miller  Gill  Miller  Gill  Miller  Yes, I think it is and like I say, then those students go out and many of  them appreciate it at the time they graduate but they   ll appreciate it even  more when they   re thirty, forty or fifty years old, I think they   ll really  appreciate it. Our college has been blessed with people who have  provided endowments for scholarships. I   m not talking about scholars  but I   m talking about monetary scholarships for undergraduates. Our  college has been quite successful in that area. We have a large number  of endowed scholarships. If you ask a donor, a big donor, why they  provided scholarship money, most of them would not cite their close  relationship with the president of the university   all due respect to the  president of the university, most students would not say that that was the  reason for their donation. And on down the line, most of them would  come back to a faculty member in a department who invested  themselves in that student so that the student would become successful.  You   ll hear people who donate money say,    I would never have  graduated had it not been for my academic advisor.     Bob Kropp or     Yes, Bob Kropp or Joe Schatzer or Joe Williams or whomever it might  be. That   s what you hear most often. Okay there are some students who  develop a good relationship with the president and that   s wonderful  because we   ve had some great presidents who love students and invested  themselves in, too, so please don   t take my remark as a negative against  the higher administration; we   ve got a great administration. But most of  our donors for big scholarships have been primarily because of a love of  their home department, their major. Maybe it was a club advisor who  was a faculty member, maybe it had been their faculty advisor, academic  advisor, it may have been the faculty member who advised their judging  team or their professional organization as a student. Those are the  relationships that last and then come back. So I daresay there   s probably  not a faculty member who   s thinking to himself,    Gee, I   ll just really  spend a lot of time with that Bart Fischer, because who knows? In  twenty-five years maybe Bart will give us a big scholarship.    (Laughter)  Most of us will be retired. I   m going to be long gone when some of these  students finally get to the place where they might donate to a scholarship  program. But you do it because you love the students. I think the fact  that we have that number of scholarships is testament to the fact that the  most important relationship is with the faculty and the student.  Ed, the flipside of the coin for a minute. We talked about the strengths of  the program. Are there some areas   I won   t say weaknesses   are there  some areas where you think we could enhance, do better, do differently,  going forward?  I think so. We have a conflict that exists and it   s one that most people  25  Gill  Miller  wouldn   t think too much about, perhaps. But we have tried to compress  our academic programs down to 120 hours   120 student credit hours     semester credits. That   s because there   s a lot of political pressure, if you  will, to get students graduated as quickly and as efficiently as possible.  Tuition is expensive. It is hard to compress the kind of breadth in a  curriculum that you would like to develop in 120 credit hours.  In agriculture, in the last five to seven years, we have had to compress  from 130 hours   most of our programs were 130 hours. We   ve had to  compress down to 120. Theoretically, that does provide for a certain  level of efficiency   certainly your total tuition required to pay is lower  with 120 hours than it was with 130 hours. But if you   re trying to  develop an individual and they   re eighteen, nineteen, twenty, twenty-one  years old and we   ve talked about,    What about an extra semester in your  investment? What about a semester abroad? What about that Ag  Legislative internship with the legislature that happens in the spring  semester that causes you to graduate a semester or two late?     I really think we need to examine our measure of success. Maybe for  many of these students, 120 hours is not really the ultimate. If they really  want to get a major, maybe they want to get a double major, maybe they  want to get minors, maybe they want to broaden their general education  perspective in addition to their major, maybe they want to do overseas  work. All these things take time. I think we have a little bit of a conflict  here. I think one of our challenges for the future is convincing folks that  perhaps this four-year, 120 hour model is not necessarily the ultimate  model.  Ed, particularly, I think I hear you saying for those students   I mean,  for all students but especially for those students who are trying to  broaden and engage them in the Scholar Recognition Program, they  need some more of these kinds of experiences, some different kinds of  coursework, et cetera.  Yes, that   s a concern that I have. I think at the university level,  increasing the interaction of undergraduates with faculty, perhaps   and  I think we do an excellent job of that in this college, but I think  university-wide we certainly have some areas where faculty across all  the university are  not  heavily invested in undergraduate students. I  don   t mean to imply that they   re not, but I think we can do a better job at  the university level of getting our faculty engaged with students,  particularly early on in their academic programs. The view that when  students get here, they   re pretty confused and really are not mature  enough to understand what their major ought to be or how they might  ought to develop and we can really wait around until they are juniors to  identify a major and then maybe find a faculty advisor for them, I think  26  Gill  Miller  Gill  is not, in my opinion, the way to go. We always tell our students,    It   s  okay to change your plans, it   s just not okay not to have a plan.    The  idea that you would come here without a plan, I think, is not a good idea.  I think every student ought to have a plan. You can change your plans. I  changed majors three times, my goodness, but you   ve got to have a plan.  In that regard, you   ll see two types of students. We   ll have some  students who seem to focus really well on academics even if their long-term  goals are not well-established or well-focused. But we have a large  number of students, as well, who until they   ve been able to set their  long-term goals or really understand what their long-terms goals are,  they really drift academically. Without a long-term goal, it   s hard for  them to focus and put the energy into each semester. Those students I  worry about. If they don   t know what they want to do out here, if they  don   t have a long-term plan, then the short-term stuff just doesn   t work  very well for them. Those are some concerns I have. And how that  relates to scholar development, well I   m not exactly sure. Most of these  kids who came into scholar development were pretty well-focused. They  knew in a general way where they were headed. They were certainly  willing to do the work in the short-term, regardless of whether the long  term plans were going to change. In terms of the broader student body  and how the scholars program impacts it, I think the scholars program  provides kind of a model, maybe, for more how we ought to deal with  all of our students.  Good point. Ed, for you personally, what   s given you the most  satisfaction from your participation in the Scholar Recognition  Program?  I thought you were going to ask me what gave me the most satisfaction  of being the Associate Dean for Academic Programs in the College of  Agriculture. (Laughter) I would have to say the meetings with  department heads once a month (laughter) that we spend is probably the  most stimulating time in my   oh excuse me, Jerry. I thought maybe I  would put a little humor in there.  I would say that although some of those meetings are valuable, those are  not necessarily the highlight of my academic career. I would have to say,  and I know that this sounds kind of like a leading question that maybe  my   it   s kind of a pad answer, but Bob Graalman, following our  breakfast with Louis Blair this past week and meeting with ten or fifteen  scholars right in this room   freshmen and sophomores   gave me  enough energy to go the whole semester. That one meeting and seeing a  few of those students, that provided enough gas to go the miles.  To survive your departmental meetings.  27  Miller  Gill  Miller  Absolutely. (Laughter) Most academicians will joke a lot about  administrative meetings and meetings and more committee meetings, but  those are pretty fantastic. We had three or four students in there, maybe  more, that were absolutely set to go. Jessie Lay, our latest Udall Scholar,  came to the meeting and gave a little stimulating comment or two. Of  course, Shannon Ferrell was there. After the meeting was over, we  couldn   t kick them out the door. These four or five students who really  were   you could tell, they were zeroing in on this   you couldn   t get  them out the door. One young man, I can remember talking to his dad  when he enrolled. His dad said,    Well,      I won   t tell you the kid   s  name, but he says,    He was out in the backyard and in the creek just all  the time. The kid loved bugs, he just dragged snakes and lizards and  bugs and everything in the house. He just loved it. He just loved,  particularly, insects. But he   s got such a great aptitude and he really  wants to be a doctor. That   s what he wants to do.    That kid was just  amazed when he found out we actually can do pre-med in the  entomology program. Well, that   s pretty unique. That   s pretty unique. A  student who   incredible ACT score, excellent student, well-focused,  etymology, pre-med, he   s done some great service work. He   s going to  spend next summer, I think, several weeks in Africa working on some  community health related issues. He   s interested in insect vectors of  disease. My gosh  What a combo. I don   t know if he   s going to become  a Truman Scholar or an Udall Scholar or anything else but he   s got the  fire, he   s got the aptitude, he   s really unique. He   s raring to go. We had  two or three students in the room like that. That   ll just take you the  whole semester right there.  Obviously, it   s been a great joy for you to participate in, hearing you  describe it. Would you recommend it to other faculty members, to be  engaged? What would you say to a faculty member about recruiting  them to participate in the scholars program?  Faculty are just like students. Not every student is designed to be a  scholar, not every faculty member is designed to be, necessarily, a great  mentor. We have faculty who contributed in so many ways. Today, there  was an article in the O   Colly about a new, young faculty member in  Biochemistry who did some visiting work at a research laboratory. He  went there and worked like for forty-eight hours straight because they  have to rent or they have to get a grant to work in that facility and he   s  discovering some things about protein structure that are going to knock  our socks off. That   s a great way to contribute. I don   t know that that  professor   s time and energy would be well-vested, although there may  be an opportunity for him to have some undergraduate students in his  laboratory and that might be his contribution.  In terms of stimulating a student to get a more liberal education, that   s  28  Gill  Miller  Gill  Miller  Gill  Miller  probably not the role for that faculty member. I think it takes this full set  of faculty and they have different roles that they can play and I think  there   s important ways that each of them can contribute. But the whole  package is not for every faculty member, so we need to discover for  individual faculty how they can best contribute in ways that are  meaningful. That varies so much. But I think every one of those faculty  then would feel extremely good if they understood how they contributed  to the success of an undergraduate student like that. So different roles,  different faculty   not the same role for every faculty member. I would  encourage every faculty member to figure out how their piece works.  Engage them?  Yes, that they can engage them.  Ed, this has been great and we   ll just leave you with this final question.  Are there some additional comments you   d like to make? Is there  something we left out that you   d like to express about the program that  we perhaps didn   t cover?  Gosh, I don   t think so. I think your questions were pretty comprehensive  and we kind of expanded on a few and went some different directions. I  think you   ll be able to get the common themes out of here. I mean,  obviously not to be glib, this is one of the areas that brings perhaps the  most joy and excitement to my job and I think the jobs of a lot of our  faculty.  Having said that, my office is also the place where students come to get  reinstated after they flunked out. And you know what? There   s some  value in doing that. Sometimes you go home and you think   I   m always  thinking of a student that   s sitting across from me and they may have  flunked out at some time and they   re trying to get back in school and  they think they   re going to do better, they   re going to do more work this  time, they   re going to focus more this time. You   re trying to figure out  whether in fact you   re just taking their money to let them back in school.  We   re not here to rob people of their money. When you let a student  back into school, you   re thinking about their paying tuition and fees to  the institution and them being successful. There   s quite a bit of joy, I  think, when you see students like that walk across the stage.  I appreciate it very much. Thank you.  Oh yes, thank you, Jerry. This is a pleasure.  -------  -------
