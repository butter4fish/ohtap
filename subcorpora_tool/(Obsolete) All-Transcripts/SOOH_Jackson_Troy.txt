 Little Thunder  Jackson  My name is Julie Pearson-Little Thunder. Today is November 5, 2013,  and I   m interviewing Troy Jackson as part of the Oklahoma Native  Artists Project sponsored by the Oklahoma Oral History Research  Program at OSU. We are at Bacone  College  where Troy is an adjunct  art instructor, working with Director Tony Tiger to revitalize the  program. Troy, you   re an enrolled Cherokee artist. Since you started  showing professionally in 2008, you   ve won as many as two awards at a  time at over twenty-seven shows, some in pottery but many in full-figure  ceramic sculpture which is very powerful in its impact. Thank you for  taking the time to talk with me.  Well, thank you.  Where were you born and where did you grow up?  I was born in Tahlequah, Oklahoma, and basically that   s where I grew  up. We done a little bit of traveling through the United States, but  mainly in Tahlequah. I was at a small district called Keys, which is  about ten miles south of Tahlequah.  What did your folks do for a living?  My dad was a auto body man. He repaired automobiles, wrecks, and my  mother was a homemaker.  What about your grandparents on either side? What role did they play?  I had some very, very good grandparents. My grandparents   my  granddad was a grader operator and was retired most of the time, so I got  to spend a lot of time with him when I was young, fishing and hunting.  We done a lot of things after he retired, so I grew up just in a really good  time.  5  Little Thunder  Jackson  Little Thunder  Jackson  Little Thunder  Jackson  Little Thunder  Jackson  Little Thunder  Jackson  Little Thunder  Jackson  Now, was this on your dad   s side or your mom   s side?  It   s on my dad   s side. My mother   s side, which my mother   s Cherokee,  her family I was around a little bit, but not as much as I was my dad   s  family  Were you around the language very much then? What was your  exposure to Cherokee culture growing up?  Very, very little Cherokee culture. It wasn   t until I came here, actually,  in    75 to Bacone, working on my associate   s degree that I became  interested in Native American work. I   d seen some of the Dick West  paintings hanging in the hallways, and the  Stephen  Mopopes, and I just  fell in love with them, you know. It was like,    Wow     Really good.  Were there any other members of your family or extended family that  were artistic?  My dad liked to draw and actually painted a few paintings, but not other  than that, no.  So your first memory of seeing Native art, would that be here at Bacone  or prior to this?  Oh, no, it would be prior. A lot of my interest actually came from  museums, but it was just for the sake of just liking the work. I admired  all of it: Western, Native American, contemporary. It   s basically  anything I   d see in museums I just,    I want to do that.    (Laughter)  What   s your first memory of making art?  My first memory of making art. You remember the little number kits  that you would get, paint-by-number sets, yeah. That   s my first.  (Laughs) Of course, I would draw. I would get magazines, and there  would be clippings from art schools that you could draw these little  images, and you would send it in. I would, and I   d have to tell them that  I was seven or eight years old. I   d get a reply. They would reply back  and say,    Well, call us when your eighteen.    I   d keep trying, but nothing  ever happened with it. (Laughter)  What experiences with art did you have in elementary school?  Almost none. I remember there were no art classes, as far as on a  schedule. There was one man (his name was Layle Hamlet) that would  come to our school once a month, and we would have an hour session.  6  Little Thunder  Jackson  Little Thunder  Jackson  Little Thunder  Jackson  Little Thunder  Jackson  Little Thunder  Jackson  Little Thunder  Jackson  Little Thunder  That was about it. (Laughs)  Now, was your school in your district, or was it in Tahlequah?  It was at Keys.  Out west, at Keys.  That   s south of Tahlequah. So that was basically up to, that was up to  the seventh grade. That was all of the art that we got.  How about after that, middle school and high school? Did you have any  exposure to art?  Yes. Now, we had classes. I thought that was one of the greatest things  because now we had a class in that high school, Tahlequah high school,  that I   d go to every day. That was a good time for me. It was.  Starting in ninth grade?  I started beginning, I began to learn a little bit about art, too. It wasn   t  just how well I could draw, which basically that   s all I did was draw. I  started learning about some of the principles and elements and things.  Were you thinking of yourself as an artist?  I thought of myself as a artist ever since I remember, as far back as,  gosh, maybe seven or eight years old. I always knew that   s what I  wanted to do. I was fortunate. I tell everyone I was so fortunate as a  young man because I knew what I wanted to do. (Laughs)  So you came to Bacone, and you came with the idea of majoring in art,  I   m guessing.  Yes. Where I grew up, art was really not favored as a young man going  into that field. You would tell someone that you were going to school to  be an artist, and they   d say,    Oh, that   s nice. Good luck with that,     something along these lines. I had that in my mind, and here at Bacone  they were offering a commercial art course, so that   s what I took. I said,     Surely I can make a living at   I may not be able to make a living  painting paint-by-number sets, so maybe I can make a living at  commercial arts.     And with your father and grandfather working in the trades, were they  supportive of that move?  7  Jackson  Little Thunder  Jackson  Little Thunder  Jackson  Little Thunder  Jackson  Little Thunder  Jackson  Little Thunder  They were. My dad was very supportive, but the most supportive in my  family was my mother. Oh, she   d make you get up and go. My dad  would say,    You need to go to school. You need to go to college,    but  my mother would say,    Now you get up, and you are going.    She was  the reason, she was the main reason why I went to college. (Laughs)  So what kind of a foundation did you get at Bacone?  I think I drew an interest in art. Not only was I doing art, but I gained a  different type of interest. Something that I realized,    Hey, there   s more  to it. There   s a lot more to it than what I think.    I wanted to learn more. I  wanted to find out more about art instead of just, maybe, the aesthetics,  and the technical side of it. I wanted to know why artists, their work was  sitting in these museums and what they had to do in order to do that.  Yeah, it created a different type of interest.  Did you have any fellow students or teachers who stood out at that time?  Here at Bacone? I remember some of the students that encouraged me,  but mainly I was mostly encouraged by artists that were already  professionals, that were already doing things in and around Muskogee  and around Tahlequah like Enoch Haney. I was interested in his work,  Chief Terry Saul, Dick West, all these guys. I was basically interested in  their work. (Laughs)  You also mentioned that it was sort of where you started having some  inter-tribal exposure, and some cultural learning was happening.  Some issues with the social issues of mixed heritage, the Native  American (Cherokee is what I am) and European or white, which my  dad   s side of the family was.  Then you went on to NSU  Northeastern State University , and you had  your associate   s degree in commercial art, I guess. Did you pursue the  same major there?  No, I changed more or less into fine art. Again, maybe I was getting out  of that stigmatism about artists. You know, hey, there   s fine art. There   s  not just commercial, and labor, and this sort, so I started painting more  at that time, also, and checking out the ceramics department. Of course,  we did not have a ceramics department here at Bacone. When I got to  Northeastern, I took a ceramics course, and I fell in love with it. I mean,  I was down there all the time.  Who was teaching at that time?  8  Jackson  Little Thunder  Jackson  Little Thunder  Jackson  Little Thunder  Jackson  Little Thunder  Jackson  Little Thunder  Jackson  Little Thunder  Jackson  Little Thunder  Jackson  Jerry Choate was teaching ceramics at that time, and a great, great  teacher.  What kinds of subject matter were you exploring in ceramics?  We were just doing mainly pottery and learning the wheel, learning how  to throw pots, and some decorating, but mostly just learning how to get  started with it.  And not really doing any Southeastern, just doing some contemporary?  Very contemporary. No, probably at this time with the ceramics, I  probably was not even thinking about Native American symbolism or  anything of that nature.  Had you sold any pieces?  At Northeastern, I sold a few pieces. Not anything to make a living at,  but I did sell a few pieces.  From some student shows or     We   d have some student shows, and I would sell one or two pieces here  and there. Actually, I would like   you think about when you sell things,  how you would like to go back and just see what happened to all that,  even see them again. So sometimes I think about that because at this  time, I   m thinking they were, like, really   they were good. (Laughter) I  don   t know about now.  Well, this is the call for whoever reads the interview. You got a job  teaching art pretty shortly after you got out of NSU, I guess, at Markoma  Christian School? Is that correct?  Well, no, it was several years.  It was several years later.  It was several years.  What did you do first when you got out of NSU?  My dad was an auto body man, and he taught me the trade, and so that   s  what   when I got out of NSU, I was, like, major lost. That   s what I did.  I did not keep focused. It   s what happened. I did not keep focused. Got  married, had a baby, so now I had to go to work. (Laughter)  9  Little Thunder  Jackson  Little Thunder  Jackson  Little Thunder  Jackson  Little Thunder  Jackson  Little Thunder  Jackson  Little Thunder  Jackson  Little Thunder  Jackson  So you didn   t continue doing   you were pretty much     Well, you know, I kind of looked at it as, repairing and fixing and  sculpting and all of that, I was still doing some art. I remember making  things out of what we call the Bondo. That is the plaster that fixes dents.  I remember making things out of that.  Little sculptures?  Yes, sculptures, and it   s strange because now today I   m using that  material in some of my new things that I   m working on.  We   ll have to talk about that. (Laughs) So you worked in that field, auto  body work, and eventually just continued working with your dad, or did  you     He and I opened a business, and I think we ran it together for ten years,  ten or twelve years. Then he retired, and I bought his part out, and I ran  it for another, basically, about another ten years. I think all the way up to  2001, I ran my own business.  When did you teach at Markoma Christian School and then Sequoyah?  During this time, I think it was from 1999 to 2000, somewhere around  there, about two years I taught there. I can   t remember exactly how  many classes. I only taught one class a day, but there were several  different age groups that came in, and I taught everyone together.  How did that come about?  There was a friend of mine. I had not been doing any artwork. Oh, my  goodness, it   s been several years. A friend of mine was going to a  church that I attended, and he just asked me. Let me see. The art teacher  they had had gotten very sick, and they needed someone to fill in. I said,     Well, yeah, I   ll do that.    So that   s how I basically got started.  And this is at Markoma?  Yes, Markoma.  And then how about Sequoyah? How did that come about?  Sequoyah came right after that. They had what they call a gifted and  talented program after school. I heard about it, and I went and applied  for it, and I got it. I taught there for, I think, one year. That   s when I  started my master   s program at the University of Arkansas. My  10  Little Thunder  Jackson  Little Thunder  Jackson  Little Thunder  Jackson  Little Thunder  Jackson  Little Thunder  schedules didn   t, they didn   t mesh, so I had to let the job go. I hated to  because it was such good money. It really was. (Laughter)  Was there something about the teaching that helped you decide to go on  to graduate school?  I think so. I think it started to ignite a little passion. Next thing I know, I  was calling my old instructor Jerry Choate and saying,    Hey, you know  of anybody that has an old wheel that they would like to get rid of?    He  goes,    No, but if I hear of anybody, I   ll call you.    It wasn   t a week; he  called me. He says,    You need to get up here and buy this. If you   re  going to do it, you better do it.    So I did. I went up there, and this guy  had a small wheel. I bought it, and I   m throwing on it today. That was in  2000, the year 2000. I   m still throwing on it.  Why did you pick the program at University of Arkansas?  A friend of mine had went to the university, and he spoke very highly of  it, and was, gosh, he was a working artist. I knew it must be a good  school because he   s got a job. He   s got a job doing this, so I think that  was one of the reasons.  Was it at the University of Arkansas that you kind of transitioned out of  pottery into more 3D, (well, pottery   s 3D) but into other forms, or were  you still sort of focused on ceramic pottery?  One thing about pottery, there   s this old idea of form, of usefulness, and  I never could get out of that form. Even the pottery that I was doing, the  functional pottery, were almost sculptural. People would say,    I  wouldn   t buy that to eat out of it.    I would say,    Well, why not? It   s  okay.       No, we could put it....    I had trouble with that because  everything I did, I wanted to cut holes in it or extend it, or I wanted to do  something that was not so quiet, and with functional stuff, that works  better with quiet. (Laughter)  Who were some of the other ceramic artists that you admired at the time,  maybe Native and non-Native?  I had not been associated with any Native artists at this time. I was  mainly   I liked the Asian pottery, anything that had to do with that. If  you ever see any of my pottery, some of the Native pottery that I do, it   ll  have a Asian quality to it. People just didn   t like that. They just don   t  like that.  Can you expand a little bit more on what about the Asian tradition you  liked and what you incorporated?  11  Jackson  Little Thunder  Jackson  Little Thunder  Jackson  Little Thunder  Jackson  Little Thunder  Jackson  Little Thunder  I think it was the unity that the Asian potters had. They weren   t just     they all respected each other   s pottery. The pottery, for instance, in  China is very, very well respected. I think I wanted that, too. I wanted a  culture that was surrounded by ceramics, that was surrounded by  tradition. That   s when I actually became involved, started becoming  involved with Native American art, is because I realized that I had that  culture. I had something that was dated back centuries, and I could be a  part of that. I could link with ancestors that were doing the same thing  that I was, hundreds if not thousands of years ago. I think that   s where  the road turned.  Now, did you dip into Southeastern motifs and designs at that time a  little bit?  While I was at the University of Arkansas, I was just starting to. I started  to study just a little bit about Native American pottery, about the pit  firing and things of this nature, but as far as my motifs and things, I   m  still very much like that of the Asian pottery.  So what was your first competitive art show after grad school?  Oh, after grad school. I think at the Trail of Tears in Tahlequah, I think  was my first. That would have been my first competition.  What did you submit?  I submitted two pieces of pottery. Let me see. I   m thinking   yes, I did,  two pieces of pottery. I   m trying to think and remember the year, but I   m  not able to.  Did you already know that you were going to focus on Native art shows  from that point on?  Yes, at that point on, yes, I knew. Again, I go back to that I always  wondered how these paintings or these pottery pieces were in museums,  and why they were on people   s shelves and these things, so I started  wondering what I had to do. I started putting together pieces of what I  needed to do in order to be a part of that and to be respected in that area  as somebody that was not just trying to necessarily win prizes but  someone that would   . I want to be known as somebody that actually  cares about what I   m doing, and I have a purpose in doing these things,  doing these pieces.  So even though there   s other Native potters, and they   re sort of working  with these Southeastern forms and motifs, and they   re on a parallel  12  Jackson  Little Thunder  Jackson  Little Thunder  Jackson  Little Thunder  Jackson  Little Thunder  Jackson  Little Thunder  Jackson  track with you, you   re focused on discovering for yourself...  Yes.     what that connection is.  Sure, discovering it for myself and being an individual. I   m not a  traditionalist in a way. I mean, I would never be like that because I think  that I would have had to have grown up in the culture to be a traditional.  Someone would have had to show me how to do it, and how to do it  well. I   m very contemporary   .  When did you begin to really shift your format into just more and more  sculptural focus?  Probably about four years ago. My pottery, again, it didn   t seem to say  anything as far as my Native culture. It was cold. It wasn   t warm. It had  very little to do with my Cherokee culture, and, again, I just never could  get that traditional, I guess you could say, that traditional feel of things. I  attempted small sculpture, and from that point on I knew that that was  what I was supposed to be.  Now, had you won some awards prior to that shift?  I had won a Judge   s Choice, I believe, on one of the pottery pieces, the  contemporary pottery pieces, but, no, only when I put a sculpture on a  vessel, I immediately won First Place. As soon as I put the sculpture on,     That   s where I need to go,    and so I did.  One trademark of your ceramic sculptures, that you   re not doing busts,  you   re doing whole-body sculpture, and while it has some stylization,  it   s quite representational, too. What led you in that direction?  I   ve always been drawn to realism. I think that if I   m   I don   t know.  Could you ask me the question again?  What led you into, sort of, that representational   there   s an element of  stylization, but there   s a lot of realism.  Okay. Yes, I think realism is very difficult to do. I think it is one of the  most difficult aspects of art, and I like that. I like the difficulty. I like  the, I guess   let me see how I want to say this. I like the involvement of  doing it, something that is difficult to me, because once I reach that, it  seems like I accomplished something and I can go a little further into  those elements.  13  Little Thunder  Jackson  Little Thunder  Jackson  Little Thunder  Jackson  Little Thunder  Jackson  Little Thunder  You   ve talked about your art reflecting a kind of working through of  both your backgrounds, Cherokee ancestry and European ancestry. I  wondered if you could just expand upon that a little bit more.  The main thing about my Cherokee heritage is that there   s some roots.  There   s roots there. We can trace them back. I can trace them back. My  granddad was a full-blood Cherokee, so I knew that his mom and dad  were full-bloods, and I knew that they came over on the Trail of Tears. I  may not have to know them personally. Not his mom and dad, I   m sorry,  his grandparents. I may not know them personally, but I know  something about where they came from and the way they lived.  My dad   s side, the European side, I have no idea, and that   s really  strange. That   s actually why I done this piece right here. The title of it is  I   m Part White, But I Can   t Prove It. I can prove that I   m Native  American, but I can   t prove that I   m white. I always thought that that  was kind of strange. That   s why I became interested in my Cherokee  heritage because I knew there was roots. I wasn   t going anywhere with  my dad   s side of the family. I couldn   t. They don   t even know where  they came from. (Laughter)  One of the challenges when you   re starting out in art is the business side  of it, and I   m wondering how you handled that.  I   m learning to handle that. I   ve done business for years. I don   t mean to  say that I hate it, but I don   t particularly like it. Some of the business is  fine, (it   s just like anything else) but there are areas of business in art  that   s really trying for me, for instance, marketing. It   s very trying. We  have the social media. Very trying to me. I did not grow up with  computers, and I   m having to learn all of this. I   m very   I don   t put  anything about myself on a webpage or anything like that. There   s parts  of it I would just like to have someone do it for me, and I would stay in  my studio and build my sculptures. (Laughs)  Does your wife play a role in the business?  She   s an encourager. My wife   s an encourager. She helps me. She will  help when we to Indian markets or anything like that. She   s always  ready to go. She likes to go. No, it   s basically, I   m on my own. She has  her thing that she does, and so I have mine.  How did you know how to price your work initially?  I don   t. Never did figure it out. (Laughs)  Still working on that?  14  Jackson  Little Thunder  Jackson  Little Thunder  Jackson  Little Thunder  Jackson  Little Thunder  Jackson  Little Thunder  Jackson  Little Thunder  Jackson  Little Thunder  Jackson  Still working on that. (Laughter) There are so many different things that  are told to you. Any artist, I   m sure that they could relate with this.    You  don   t sell your work for nothing, but you don   t sell it too high.    You   re  going,    Whoa. Okay.    (Laughs) I have to eat. I hear people tell me all  the time,    Well, you sold that too cheap     I   m going,    What? I wish you  would have sold it for me     (Laughter) No, so there   s things like that.  It   s still a work in progress. You can cut any of this out, too, right, if you  want to? (Laughter)  You won Best of Classification at Santa Fe Indian Market in 2011. Was  that your first year to do the Market?  No. Let me see, 2010 was my first year I went out with the Art Center in  Tahlequah.  The Cherokee Art Center?  The Cherokee Art Center. I went as a group, as a participant. There were  three or four of us went out.  You had a booth     We had a booth.     at the art center.  We had two pieces that we could enter into the competition. I entered  one, and I forget who entered another one, but I won a First Place. Yes,  that was pretty big to go to Santa Fe for the first time and do that.  Absolutely. What were your expectations about Indian Market?  To win. To win something in the competition. (Laughs) I mean, you   re  just taking one piece, basically, with you, and that   s about all there is to  do is to enter into that competition because there is some prestigious  benefits to winning a show like that.  Oh, definitely. So did you have collectors in front of your booth early the  next morning?  No, no. There was no one there. (Laughs)  Did you sell your piece?  I did not. There was no one there. They would come and look at it and  15  Little Thunder  Jackson  Little Thunder  Jackson  Little Thunder  Jackson  Little Thunder  Jackson  Little Thunder  Jackson  Little Thunder  Jackson  Little Thunder  say,    That   s nice,    but no, there was no collectors there. I don   t know  why it happened because people said,    Well, you should have done  really well if you win First Place,    but no, I didn   t. (Laughter)  Well, I think all these other awards have probably made up for that. You  won Best of Show at Cherokee Holiday Show, I think, that same year.  What did that mean to you?  No, now, the year that   this was this year. Now, I did go to Santa Fe  again this year. I was talking about the year   it would have been 2011.  Okay, yes. Let   s talk about 2013 then, or 2012?  I   m sorry, that was last year. This year I went to Santa Fe, in 2013, and I  won a Best of Classification in pottery, which was a major, major win  for me because there are eleven out of the whole show. There are eleven  people out of, I don   t know, probably a thousand entries.  And it was a pot?  It was pottery, very contemporary. I never thought   it was the most  contemporary piece that I   d ever done. I just really didn   t think that, you  know, that it was maybe what they liked, and they just absolutely loved  it for the pottery division.  What do you think made it stand out so much?  I was told that there has never been   it is so different that they had not  seen anything like that.  It was wheel-thrown?  It was wheel-thrown and hand-built, both, which that   s one of the things  that I like to do is addition. We call it addition, subtraction, and  manipulation with clay. I like to do all three. If I can find something else  that I can do, I   ll do that, too. I   ll find another term to use.  Well, how about your win, then, at the Cherokee Holiday Show?  The Cherokee Holiday Show, I tried for seven years to place in that  show. It seemed like I would always place, a First Place in pottery, but  to win that was pretty cool because I think this was like seven or eight  years that I tried to win the show, and I finally done it. (Laughter)  And it has some good prize money attached to it. How did that impact  your art production?  16  Jackson  Little Thunder  Jackson  Little Thunder  Jackson  Little Thunder  Jackson  Little Thunder  Jackson  Monetary gain is always good at a win, but I don   t think   there   s not  enough money to do a lot of things with. It gives you an encouragement  to continue, and it does allow you to buy more material. It does allow  you to pay your bills. All those things are always in your head. You still  have to make a living.  What   s been more important to you so far, in terms of your career:  booth shows or galleries?  Booth shows at this point. I   m only showing at one gallery, at the Spider  Gallery in Tahlequah right now. To be honest, most of it, though, has  been for the competitions and to get noticed. I think that   s worked really  well for me. I   ve recently been contacted by the  National Cowboy and  Western Heritage  Museum in Oklahoma City to be a part of their show  this month, the fifteenth of this month. I thought that was a major   and  that was because of some of the competitions that I won. I won a  competition two years ago. The Museum of Art and Design actually put  together a show and contacted me, and I got to be a part of that, which is  a traveling show that goes around the United States for three and a half  years. Because of that win, that   s why they called me. I guess they think  if you win a prize, you   ll be good enough for the shows.  Have you done a little bit of traveling out of state as well or has it just  been your work so far that     No, I travel with my work as much as I can. We did go to New York and  Santa Fe. We go to anything. Sulphur, Oklahoma, I think is the last one  we went to, Chickasaw. I try to go for the openings if it   s not too far.  Was that the first time you   ve been to New York? What was that  experience like?  No, it was the second. I   ve been to New York before, but this time it was  a little different. I was a little more comfortable with it this time. Of  course it had been roughly eight, probably seven or eight years since I   d  been there before, but I was a little more comfortable this time. It   s a  shock when you first go to New York. It   s a shock. (Laughter)  So when were you hired here at Bacone?  Let me see. That would be 2011. I became acquainted with Tony, the  director here, Tony Tiger, and we got to talking about maybe starting a  3D program here at Bacone. I came aboard as an adjunct instructor, so  I   ve been here, I think it   s my third year here.  17  Little Thunder  Jackson  Little Thunder  Jackson  Little Thunder  Jackson  Little Thunder  Jackson  Little Thunder  Jackson  Little Thunder  Jackson  Little Thunder  In what ways has teaching impacted your own artwork?  Oh, teaching the fundamentals of art, it just opened all that back up, all  of that, the things that you put out of your mind. It just brought it all  back to witness. It   s kind of, like, revitalized. It   s like,    Oh, yeah, I  remember that. Let me put this in there,    or something like that. But yes,  it   s true. If you want to learn anything, go you teach it, and you will  learn it. (Laughter)  How do you balance your artwork and your teaching?  I think I do a pretty good job of it, as far as the balancing. Well, I have to  look at it as I   m still learning. As teaching, I teach myself the same as I  teach the students. I think the balancing is pretty easy. I don   t have much  trouble with it because I get to put to practice what I preach, and it keeps  me on guard, so to speak, because if I tell my students,    This works,     I   m going to make sure I   m doing it myself.  What other museum shows have been important to you? You mentioned  the New York show, which was the Changing Hands show, I guess.  You mean as far as my work or     Yes, as far as your work.  Probably what is coming up now with the Cowboy and Western  Museum. I think it   s ironic in a way because I never contacted them. I  remember I was talking to my wife about Native American work, and I  said   but I have two cultures. I have one culture that came maybe more  from the Industrial Revolution with the sense   . I thought it was strange,  because I was telling myself,    I   m really thinking about doing some  Western-type motifs and get into some Western scenes of figures.    Low  and behold, they called me. I was like,    Maybe this is like that first  sculpture that I did. Maybe that   s a direction I need to go.    So I   ll see.  Have you done a Western subject for the show?  I think   what do I mean to say? Let me see. The pieces that I have were  Native American, but I think that they will hold true with some of the  Western motifs. I think so.  That   s what you   re putting in the show?  Yes.  Yeah, because we were in the West. Natives are in the West, too.  18  Jackson  Little Thunder  Jackson  Little Thunder  Jackson  Little Thunder  Jackson  Little Thunder  Jackson  Little Thunder  Jackson  Yes.  You   ve been pretty involved in various artist associations, the Cherokee  Artists Association, which became the Southeastern  Indian  Artists  Association, and the Tahlequah Arts Guild. Sometimes artists don   t want  to do that organizational thing. Why do you feel it   s important?  Oh, it   s important to surround yourself with what your interest is. If your  profession is art, surround   I   d love to surround myself with people to  feed off of each other, to encourage, to be encouraged, and see what   s  going on with other artists. It   s the same with any field. The more you  have together, the stronger you are, so that   s one of the reasons that I  started getting involved with Cherokee Artists Association. They could  teach me something. They could show me about Native American art.  Especially the ones that had been doing it for years, I made sure that we  were elbow to elbow. I think it worked out really well.  Let   s talk a little bit about your process and techniques a little more  specifically. So I imagine you use commercial clay.  Yes.  You mentioned that you like to do a combination of wheel throwing and  hand-built. I thought I read that you had to make or invent some new  equipment to do some of your more ambitious sculpture. Can you talk  about that a little?  Well, sometimes I have to raise my kiln. I have to add onto the kiln, and  I have to make preparations for the firing and get it to fire to a certain  amount. Anything you do to a kiln, it changes the temperature that you  need to get to. I   m pretty good at making something out of nothing and  making something else work, a particular tool or anything like that. I  was always brought up that I never needed a lot of tools. I just needed to  be able to use what I had, and so that   s the way I do my art now. You  could come to my studio; you won   t find a whole lot of tools. I just don   t  need them. This is impressive, but   . (Laughter)  Well, what about bond? You mentioned that you work with bond.  Bondo.  Bondo.  That   s the old term for it, for the material used to repair dents that   s in  metal. It works very much like any plaster. What I started doing was  19  Little Thunder  Jackson  Little Thunder  Jackson  Little Thunder  Jackson  Little Thunder  Jackson  Little Thunder  Jackson  Little Thunder  Jackson  using that for backgrounds, some of the pieces that I   m doing. Then the  clay is attached to that. I can get a lot of airbrushing with different  paints, brighter color even, that can correspond with the clay and  contrast because there   s two very different materials.  When you say airbrushing, are you talking about the patina?  No, the airbrushing is what I do on the Bondo or the     Oh the Bondo, okay.  It   s like you would paint a car.  Gotcha.  You   ve seen some of the customized jobs that people do on automobiles.  Well, I can do that, also. I can apply that to my artwork, too. Text, just  numerous things that I can do with it.  And there are some size restrictions or challenges, as people who work  with ceramics know. Have you run into those with your sculptures?  Yes. Usually, if you stay within a four-foot range, you   re pretty safe. My  pieces will be, I   ll start out at four feet if that   s the limitation. I   ll start  out at four feet because I know it   s going to shrink. The clay is going to  shrink once it   s fired, and so it   s going to be under four feet. If I could, it  would be life-size. That   s what I   m shooting for. That is my goal now, is  for life-sized figures.  Out of clay?  I   m not certain. Clay doesn   t want to. It   s not very friendly once it gets  very tall. It   s just not very friendly, or not to me. It wants to twist and  break and crack and all this good stuff. With some of the stuff that I  want to do, I   m going to have to change materials.  One of the things that you   re known for is very elaborate, kind of, both  bas-relief and incising, lots of pattern and lots of design. Can you talk a  little bit about how you got involved in that?  I think just going back to the principles of design. I know that when I  draw   I think it   s because when I done auto body work, everything had  to be so smooth. I mean, it had to be perfect. When the customer came to  get the piece, it had to be perfect. It had to match. I remember thinking a  lot of times how,    Man, this would look really nice if I could just   ,    so  that   s what I do now. I don   t have to do that. My images can, they can  20  Little Thunder  Jackson  Little Thunder  Jackson  Little Thunder  Jackson  Little Thunder  Jackson  Little Thunder  Jackson  have texture; they can do whatever they want to. On some of these  pieces, I   ve got gears and cogs and stuff that I put on, so, yeah, I don   t  have to do the norm as what I used to.  Now, I know you haven   t been at these ceramic sculptures that long, but  how have they changed in terms of subject matter and format?  The older I get, the more concerned, the more family-oriented I become,  and I think that everything I do, all of my figures, are because of perhaps  maybe not just a family member, or maybe a story about a family  member or something like that. I don   t know. I just don   t know. I would  have to say that   s maybe just because of my family because that   s what I  know. I don   t know how to say that. (Laughter)  Now, has the coloring of your ceramic pieces, which I know depends on  the firing process, too, has that changed quite a bit?  Oh, well, it   s changed from my pottery. I do not like glaze. I never could  get comfortable with glazes. The oxides that I use, I   m very comfortable  with. I don   t like sheen. I mean, a little bit of sheen is fine, but I just  don   t like that, especially not for sculptures. I think they have a more  earthly sense to them. I think they have a, yeah, more earthly quality of  what clay was meant for it to be. Even the clay itself almost has a  figurative color, with some of the buffs for instance, so there   s not a  whole lot that you have to even do with the clay.  So you   re talking about slips that have the oxides in them?  No, just pure oxides.  Just pure oxides.  No, I do not use any slips, just pure oxides.  Another thing that you have been doing lately is sort of combining  materials. Like, you will have the clay sculpture, but then you might  have a piece of metal on it. We   ll be looking at those pieces at the end of  the videotape, this one with the two balls. How did you first get that idea  to sort of start bringing in some other materials?  The clay can be mixed with anything, I mean as far as other materials,  and be incorporated into clay. I think that probably that piece there, that  is when I started thinking about the Bondo and putting   . Now, these  are clay, but I think at that point, I was starting to think about adding  more material to them, different material. For me, it just kind of evolved  from there. The copper, you   ll notice I put a few copper rings in it to  21  Little Thunder  Jackson  Little Thunder  Jackson  Little Thunder  Jackson  Little Thunder  Jackson  Little Thunder  hold the cross, and things of this nature. I don   t know. It just seems like  it calls for, maybe, some mixed media.  Before you do a figure, do you sketch it out beforehand?  Sometimes. Sometimes, but not because   I have mental images. As  soon as I start the figure, it   s already there. Sometimes I may make a few  sketches to see if it   s going to work. How much of a bend that I can put  in that piece without it breaking, or how tall I can I can get it or  something, size relationship. Probably for size relationship more than  anything, how tall I want the base, for instance, and what I want the  figure to stand on it or sit on or something like that. Mainly I know what  I want to do.  How about some of the designs that are incised. Do you sketch those out  beforehand or     No. Now, the text that I put on these pieces are Cherokee from the  Cherokee syllabary. Now, those I will sketch out and put them on. As far  as the designs, I look through Native American designs. These are  actually part of them, but they   re all abstract, too, just a different motif.  It still kind of generates off of the original, the old traditional symbols  and things of this nature.  What kinds of research do you do for your     Not as much as I should. I still go back, and I learn a lot by talking to  people. That   s one of, probably, my best attributes of getting my  research is from going to a source of someone who really knows. A lot  of the reading and things, it   s hard for me to understand. I   m not a  archaeologist. I   m not a historian. I   m an artist. I try to, but I do my best  work by talking to people.  What is your creative process from the time you sort of get an idea?  I just go to   again, it just seems like I know what I   m going to do, and I  just need to get it out. One of the things that I feel that I do not create  anything, and I   ve learned that a long time ago, that I just discover.  That   s helped me more than anything, to realize that I know that if I take  this off, this happens. If I do this, then this happens. I start a process of,  with clay, I start a process of elimination, actually.  It sounds like you don   t really need to even jot down ideas. You just sort  of carry them in your head until you go to work, or do you sometimes  keep track of ideas in a notebook or something?  22  Jackson  Little Thunder  Jackson  Little Thunder  Jackson  Little Thunder  Jackson  Little Thunder  Jackson  Little Thunder  Jackson  Little Thunder  Jackson  I think keep track of ideas in my head when I see something. Well, some  of these images has been from museums that I   ve visited. This piece  right behind me, there is an artist by the name of William Lee who is at  the Bartlesville Woolaroc Museum. He had done a painting of an old  Indian with a plow, (of course, at his time it was very contemporary)  with the buffalo and stuff running in the clouds, and that left an  impression on me. A friend of mine, (here recently I   ve been meeting  with him) he   s a farmer, and he had an old plow sitting out there.  Immediately, I thought about that painting, so I went and done it. It was  just fast. I took all the measurements off of his plow that was available  to me, and I just did it. I don   t think there was one sketch. I don   t think I  did any sketches.  So what   s your creative routine? Do you prefer to work in the morning  or at night or whenever you have time?  I prefer to work (it   s hard to say) sometimes morning and sometimes  night. One of the things that a small businessman has to do is he has to  learn to be diligent. He has to learn discipline. Sometimes my discipline  gets a little slow, so I might be out there in the evening if that happens.  If it   s right on in the morning   I   m mostly a morning person, I am, but  there   s just so many things I like to do, too.  And you have a commercial kiln that     I haven   t        you haven   t really tampered with too much     No.     in terms of kiln     It has a computer control which makes it nice. I don   t have to sit with it  all the time, and I can set it to whatever temperature I want. I   m pretty  well safe with it. You want to make sure it shuts off, you know.  Right.  Always want to make sure it shuts off.  Do you have your own sort of studio at home? Do you have a workspace  at home?  I have a workspace at home, yes. I converted my garage into my  workspace, and it works out good.  23  Little Thunder  Jackson  Little Thunder  Jackson  Little Thunder  Jackson  Little Thunder  Jackson  Little Thunder  So looking back on your sort of brief professional career so far, what  has been a kind of pivotal point, a fork in the road for you in your art  career?  You know, I don   t think I really see things as being forks. I   ve actually  given some thought to this. I think when I come to a decision, whichever  decision I make because I never know what that other decision would  be, I don   t think that I really look at it as being a fork. I just go, and  we   ll see what happens. Sometimes, maybe, I think I might should do  that. (Laughter) I enjoy doing art, so any path I take I think has been  pretty neat, especially if things are working for me. I look at that a lot.  Whatever   s working for me, it seems like that   s the way I like to go.  What   s been one of the highlights of your career so far?  Gosh, I think everything that   s happened to me has been a highlight. I  never expected to win this many awards, and I really can   t put one above  the other because they are just so   . I   m honored to do that. I think  probably if I was going to think of any highlight that maybe it would be  that my children, my family, would say,    He   s doing something.    I think  that would probably be my highlight. (Laughs)  What   s been one of the low points so far?  I hate to say this, but probably, I don   t mean to say money in the sense  that that   s everything that I think about, but being an artist is tough. It   s  not an easy road to handle, and some of the lessons that you go through,  just like any other business or any other profession. One of the biggest  mistakes that I think I made, and I caution students that I talk to, is to  think that everything   s just going to work out, that somebody   s going to  see my work, they   re gong to just come down here, and they   re going to  pick it up, and I   d have it made. I won   t even have to work for it. I think  that   s a big mistake. You have to work for it. Getting over some of  issues that you thought were right, and you find out that they were not  right.  Even though you don   t enjoy the new media very much, your webpage is  very nice. I think it   s just very well done.  Well, thank you. (Laughs) I don   t know sometimes. Like I say, me and  computers, I   m learning. (Laughter)  Well, is there anything else you   d like to add or that we forgot to  mention before we look at your artwork?  24  Jackson  Little Thunder  Jackson  Little Thunder  Jackson  Little Thunder  Jackson  Little Thunder  Jackson  Little Thunder  Jackson  No, I think it   s pretty well   . I mean, unless you have some more  questions, I have nothing more to add.  Okay. We   ll take a look at your work here. How about this piece? Would  you like to tell us about this?  Yes, this piece here is a perfect example of my work of dealing with  social issues of mixed cultures. There   s two spheres which represent, are  symbolic, of Native American and European culture, the red being  Cherokee, and the white being European. The piece is titled I   m Part  White But I Can   t Prove It. I actually received this title from a friend of  mine who is a full-blood Cherokee. We were having breakfast one  morning, and someone asked him how much Indian he was. We don   t  think about that as being an issue, but for some reason it is. Some  people, they want to know. I don   t know why he said it, but he said,     Well, I   m part white, but I can   t prove it.    I thought that was such an  interesting statement, so that   s what I titled this piece.  And I love the way the incising here almost works like, it looks like  tattooing almost. It   s just a really nice look.  Well, they done a lot tattooing      Yes.     so I wanted to incorporate some symbolism, or actually not any  definite symbolism, but just some abstract line work     Okay.     to show that our ancestors did do some tattooing and marking of their  bodies.  Right. And how about this piece?  This piece, I had been interested in the Industrial Revolution and what  effects it   s had on Native Americans. I had a friend once tell me,    Where  would the Indian have been if the Europeans hadn   t have come over?    I  don   t like to get into a lot of detail about things of that nature, but it left  an impression on me. I started thinking about how the Industrial  Revolution affected us, not just Native American, but how it affected my  European side of the family. The plow, my goodness, was one of the  biggest turning points. When I done this piece, I kept thinking about  how we as people progress and how the industry has helped us to  progress, so I titled this Waiting On the Tractor because we   re always  seeking how to make things easier for ourselves.  25  Little Thunder  Jackson  Little Thunder  Jackson  Little Thunder  Jackson  Little Thunder  Jackson  Little Thunder  Jackson  I sort of interpreted it as it   s sort of broken. Some piece is broken from  this.  Could be. They may be a thing of the past. There is some symbolism,  some narrative to a story. The man is checking his pocket watch, and if  you could see the time, it would be at five o   clock because that   s when  farmers are already out there. They   re past time; they should   ve been  there before. He   s trying to wave them down. He   s trying to figure out  why they   re not there. (Laughs)  Okay, that   s a pocket watch. Okay. That   s neat. And how about this  piece?  Well, people today, I believe that people today go through the same  things that people did centuries ago. Of course there   s different things,  but basically we go through the same things. I always thought about how  in Tahlequah there is a male and female seminary which became a  higher learning facility for Native Americans, and I wondered how they  would be chosen to get to go to these schools. I think about today how I  felt, for instance, when I got a letter of acceptance into Bacone or the  college, (by the way, that is the title of this: Letter of Acceptance) how  we all, different organizations, different areas of our life, how we wait  for letters of acceptance. The base of this, I think that, well, represents     there are seven clans to the Cherokee people, so there   s seven images,  figures, at the bottom, which that   s what that represents. Then it has the  Cherokee syllabary of the acceptance letter is what it says.  That   s a really beautiful piece and such a neat expression.  I was always fascinated with Bernini and his sculptures and the way that  he would put life into them, and how they would extend out and come  into the viewer   s space. The early Baroque, they were just so aggressive,  and come out. I like to think that mine have just a little bit of glimmer.  Come a little bit into the viewer   s space. (Laughter)  They   ll think I was a genius. (Laughs)  Well, thank you so much for your time today, Troy.  Well, thank you for having me. I appreciate that.  -------  -------
