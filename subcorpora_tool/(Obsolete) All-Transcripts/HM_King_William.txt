Speaker 1: Okay, and what's today's date?
Speaker 2: Eighteen, June, 2002 [June 18, 2002].

Speaker 1: All right, and what's your occupation, sir?
Speaker 2: Professor of Afro American Studies.
Story_ID: 55478
Speaker 1: All right, now, there are five "People" magazine-ish-type questions that I am compelled to ask you.  And the first one is what is your favorite food?
Speaker 2: Seafood, see it and eat it.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, what is your favorite color?
Speaker 2: Brown.
Speaker 1: What is your favorite season of the year?
Speaker 2: Probably spring.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: All right, and do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: I don't know.  I suspect that if you ask folk who know me, they'll say, well, he says this all the time or that all the time, but no, I don't know whether I do.
Story_ID: 55479
Speaker 1: Okay, so you were born February 11th, 1940, in Cleveland.
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: And tell, tell us about your parents.  What, what was your mother's name?
Speaker 2: Daisy.
Speaker 1: All right, Da--Daisy King?
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: And what was her maiden name?
Speaker 2: Simms.
Speaker 1: Simms?
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: And what, what was she like, and what was her (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Free spirit.  She bridled at the restrictions that were placed on women and black folk at the time, was a very proud woman, bright, but at the same time--shy is not the word I'm looking for--it was more a thing of she'd rather be invisible, okay.  I only have one small photograph of her that must have been taken when I was maybe three or four, and that's it.
Speaker 1: Okay, what was her occupation?
Speaker 2: Basically a housewife.
Speaker 1: And how did she express her independence and--
Speaker 2: She had very little hesitation telling you what she felt.  That was the way she would do it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you remember being involved in any civic activities or activities like that, you know, at school or anything like that?  Did she take the leadership at church or?
Speaker 2: She sang in the choir.  And I remember that after a time, must have been sometime in the '50s [1950s], early '50s [1950s], when she went across town to become a member of the Mt. Zion Congregational Christian Church.  And I believe what motivated her to do that is she was interested in me being involved with a better class of people, might be a generous way to put that, because I was in a city all the way.
Speaker 1: Was the neighborhood that you lived in pretty rough?
Speaker 2: I didn't find out how rough until I took my first college sociology course.  Yeah, I mean that's a standard answer that folk give.  But, I don't know.  I just knew it as, as the hood.  Yeah, sure, there were prostitutes on the corner.  Yeah, there were crimes in the neighborhood, that sort of thing.  But for me, it was always just a place where I grew up, where I went to school, and where I lived.  When it was clear that what was a recession in the white community was a depression in the black community.  Jobs were not available, so my daddy said to me, son, you best go down and see what the military has to offer, and I did.
Story_ID: 55480
Speaker 1: Now, I wanna, you know, backtrack to your--when your mother and father met.  Do, do they have a story about when meeting?  And then, you know, we'll about your father.
Speaker 2: Not that I remember.  They married in 1921--yeah, 1921.
Speaker 1: Okay, and I think I read that your, your mother's from Alabama.
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm, she came up from Greensboro to Cleveland in 1910, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, so how--when was she born?
Speaker 2: Twenty, January, 1896 [January 20, 1896].
Speaker 1: When--was your father originally from Cleveland [Ohio]?
Speaker 2: No, Lynchburg, Virginia.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And he came--he migrated up to Cleveland [Ohio] to--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: I suspect that my father settled in Cleveland [Ohio] when he got home from the war.  Because the one thing I do remember my mother saying is that he looked so handsome in his Army uniform.
Speaker 1: Now, we're talking about World War I?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, he was 92nd Division, the old Buffalo Division.  And he was a sergeant.  And interestingly enough, he was one of the few black troops to see combat in France.  I remember that he went to sleep in a foxhole one night.  And he woke up the next morning, he was paralyzed from the neck down, as a result of the gas attack.  And he recovered.  And I'm pretty sure that when he got out of the Army, probably about 1919, somewhere around in there, he chose not to return to Virginia.  I also have a suspicion that it was the second marriage for both of them, because there was not a whole lot of discussion about their histories.  You know, so it was this business of gleaning a piece of information here, a piece of information there, that sort of thing.
Story_ID: 55481
Speaker 1: You say your parents didn't talk very much about their backgrounds then.  And did, did, did, did they ever talk about their parents, or did you ever meet your grandparents?
Speaker 2: I went to my grandmother's--my maternal grandmother's funeral in 1942, I believe.  But no, no, they were much older when I came along, as, as you can tell.
Speaker 1: So there, there wasn't much discussion about slavery or slave--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Oh no.
Speaker 1: --they--
Speaker 2: No, no, no, no.  One incident I do remember, I must have been about 10 maybe.  And my sister and I had been playing in the backyard I think.  And I remember coming in, and we sat at the dining room table getting ready for dinner.  And I made some comment about the Egyptians being a black people.  And, ooh, we gotta watch out for this one, okay, that kind of thing.  But there was no real discussion of a black heritage in the King household, except in one respect.  From as far back as I remember, "Get an education, son; that's the only thing they can't take from you."
Speaker 1: The implications meaning that "they" can take everything else from.
Speaker 2: Precisely.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Whoever "they" were.  The "they" was not specified, but you understood.
Story_ID: 55482
Speaker 1: Now, you, you have a, sort of a, milestone later on in your child, childhood.  But la--but I wanna got back to the early childhood memories and ask you what were the sights, and sounds and smells of your early years in Cleveland.  You know, what was your neighborhood like?  What did pe--people cook--
Speaker 2: Tree lined.
Speaker 1: Tree lined--
Speaker 2: Tree lined, two tree in front of every house, until of course they began breaking up the pavement.  The roots began breaking up the pavement.  Then the city came through and cut them down.  But when I first went into the neighbor or when I first became conscious of the neighborhood, I would say I must have been maybe five, about the time I started to Columbia Elementary School, because one picture I remember from that time has me amongst the group of white children because the neighborhood was in transition at the time.  And there were maybe three, maybe four, colored children in the--on the, on the steps, okay, where the picture was taken.  And yeah, I remember the movie theater at the corner that used to do the Saturday afternoon serials.  My mother could get rid of me for a whole afternoon for 25 cents, 10 cents admission and 15 cents for popcorn.  And there would be a cartoon and a serial and double feature, so I was gone the whole afternoon.
Story_ID: 55483
Speaker 1: --neighborhood--that church, or, or rather, that movie theater eventually became a church like a number of other structures.  I remember down the street, around the corner, a couple of blocks north was the Jewish deli, great food.  I remember going the other way, south on a 105th Street, with my father.  And we would go down to the chicken market, and he'd pick the chicken he'd want.  They'd take it in the back, kill it, pluck it.  I remember some of the neighbors, the Hymans, Ms. Rogers, who lived across the street.  Don't really remember any--except Mrs. Sharpe, first black teacher I ever had, fourth grade.  Her and my mother were great friends, so you know I couldn't mess up, don't you.  The other thing, speaking of that, what I do remember about my neighborhood is it was one of them old-fashioned neighborhoods where if you've messed up at the corner, everyone on the street had the right to correct your behavior.  And they phoned ahead of you on your way home so that your mama had the complete details by the time you got home.  And what they hadn't taken care of--what Ms. Jones, Ms. Smith hadn't taken care of--mama took care of when you got home.  So yeah, those--there were those things.  Yeah.
Speaker 2: So what, what was the name of the neighborhood you lived in?
Speaker 1: Glenville.
Speaker 2: Glenville?
Speaker 1: Glenville.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And that's on what side of town.
Speaker 1: East.
Speaker 2: East Cleveland?
Speaker 1: Yeah--no, not East Cleveland.  It was actually, it was--the street I live on was Greenlawn, and it was perpendicular to 105th Street.  It was equally distant between St. Clair and Superior, okay.  And I suppose that would make it in the northeast quadrant of the city.  But it was not a huff that came to symbolize--it was clearly a neighborhood that was in transition.  And by the time I left it in '58 [1958], it was clearly deteriorating.
Speaker 2: Was it mainly a Jewish neighborhood before you moved in--you, you, you all moved into it?
Speaker 1: I'm not sure.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I really don't remember.  I know there were white people in it.  There were even white people that lived on the street.  But no, no, I don't, don't really remember.
Story_ID: 55484
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, what, what were you like as a youth?  I mean when you--as a, as a kid going to school for the first time, I mean, what, what, what are your memories of, of the neighborhood and the school?  And what kind of a person were you?
Speaker 2: Shy, quiet, curious.  I wouldn't exactly refer to myself as conforming, however.  Yeah, yeah, I liked education.  I didn't like school, okay.  The--I mean I learned what I was supposed to learn, especially my multiplication tables.  I could do them all the way up to, what, 12 x 13.  But it was a rigid existence.  I would much rather go off and be by myself.  I would much rather find a book.  I would much rather sit and stare at the sky.
Speaker 1: Now, what--
Speaker 2: Blue sky--(unclear).
Speaker 1: What, what, what sorts of books and what sorts of reading material attracted you in those days?
Speaker 2: Well, after I got through with "Dick and Jane," I can remember going to the library and just kind of wandering.  I don't remember specifically anymore what kinds of things I took out.  As I got older, when I got to junior high school, yeah, I remembered from there.  Matter of fact it was in junior high school that I decided that what I wanted to do with the rest of forever was teach.  And the easiest way to understand that is that I was more interested in reading and thinking and writing, but I understood that I had to have some visible means of support.  So it seemed to me that the easiest way to accomplish both was to teach.  So at age thirteen I decided that's what I wanted to do, was teach.
Speaker 1: (Unclear) sort of like to go back, though, to before--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --you were 13 and when you were smaller.  But what kinds of things did you do for fun?  And, and if it was reading, you know, like what, what kind--
Speaker 2: Well, I would do that, magazines, newspapers; I did play baseball and football and those kinds of things.
Speaker 1: And you mentioned the movies.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I did that on--but that was a, a Saturday kind of thing, and of course I really didn't do that until I was eight, nine, ten, right in there.  I had a paper route when I was eleven.  It started when I was eleven.  I must have kept that route for, goodness, three for years, something like that at least I believe, delivered the "Cleveland Press" paper that's not published anymore.  And I remember working for my father one summer.  That was a trip.
Story_ID: 55485
Speaker 1: Now, what, what did your father do for a living?
Speaker 2: He was a postal employee, but he also had a real estate investment company with a, a bunch of his friends.  They owned maybe two or three multifamily units.  And that's where I learned how to be handy with my hands, how to fix things, how to paint, carpent, those sorts of things, useful skills that stayed with me.  But yeah, that, that would be--some of this stuff I haven't thought about it--
Speaker 1: Yeah, were, were you and your--
Speaker 2: --in quite some--
Speaker 1: --close?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  My mother died before my father.  I didn't cry at my mother's funeral.
Speaker 1: When did she die?  Was it when you were still young?
Speaker 2: No, no.  She died in '68 [1968].  And I didn't cry at her funeral because I figured my father--I needed to be strong for my father.  You know,--at that time, when a male was raised, as my father used to say, emotion in a man is a sign of weakness.  And I learned that lesson very well, very well, okay.  But when he died, you know, I came apart at the seams, because in some ways he was really my first teacher, okay.  I know what they say about women being the cultural barriers and that sort of thing.  But my mother was an Aquarian, as am I.  And she in some ways could be remote, and distant, and standoffish, and opinionated, but I loved her very much.  We could tangle; we could argue, okay.  But my mother was also color conscious.  And yeah, there is that aspect of it.
Story_ID: 55486
Speaker 1: Can you explain what you mean by color conscious?  Was she light or dark?  How did she--how, how did color consciousness manifest itself?
Speaker 2: She was light.  She always used to say that when the summer came she was gonna put me under a bushel basket, keep the rays of the sun from darkening me.  Yeah, she had--I have a suspicion that maybe sometime during the '20s [1920s] to get employment she passed.  I don't know that for a fact, but I suspect, okay.  My father--
Speaker 1: What, what makes you suspect that?  I mean is there--was there, there some evidence?
Speaker 2: There was a hint, came out in conversation or, or something to that effect.  My father could have passed for a white man, you know, light, bright, damn near white, good hair.  But to the best of my knowledge, he didn't ever.
Story_ID: 55487
Speaker 1: Now, would you consider yourself a happy child, you know?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.  And it's interesting because I would say that for the most part I was and didn't really question Melvin and Daisy.  I didn't look like them, okay, not as, you know, not in the sense that one's progeny look like one's parents.  But, for me they were always mom and dad. and they stayed mom and dad until--let's see now, maybe I was eleven, somewhere between eleven and thirteen that my youngest sister, bless her heart, came bouncing into my room and she said, Billy, did you know you were adopted?  And of course this had not ever occurred to me.  I had no real reason to question whether Melvin and Daisy were my parents.  I didn't know anything about birth parents and foster parents and adoptive parents and all that.  I just didn't really pay any attention to that.  And I'm not exactly sure how I responded to my sister, but I do remember asking my mother whether what my sister had said was true.  My sister said that she had been going through Daisy's drawers, and she came across the adoption papers for yours truly.  And I, I have a vague memory of when I asked my mother, she hemmed and hawed and sought to evade and escape the revelation, but she told me yeah.  Probably the hardest part for me was she made some uncharacteristic--for her anyway, uncharacteristic remarks about my birth mother.  But as I got older I understood what that was about, because she really didn't want me to go searching because she was afraid that maybe I wouldn't want her as my mother anymore.  I mean, known this woman all of my life.  What was I gonna do?  Throw her out with the bath water, what?  Not likely.  It seems to me I remember being more reserved, at least for a while, with her and, and with Melvin.  Less Melvin than with her, okay, because here, all of this time, in some ways, she could be a difficult woman to be with because she was opinionated.  But to discover that she wasn't the woman who had born me, to discover that--and as I, as I think about it now, I probably blamed her more for not being truthful with me than I blame my father.  I'm not sure for what reason, other than that I just--maybe because she's the one that had the papers in her possession.  I don't know.  I haven't really thought about it a whole lot because, as I say, she was the only mother I knew.  And I seem to recall that as the years passed, we got it back together or what have you.
Story_ID: 55488
Speaker 1: But I would say that in some ways my mother did not ever really forego her colored, middle-class upbringing in Greensboro [Alabama] where her family, the Simms family, was emergent middle class in some ways, okay.  So she had those values, okay.
Speaker 2: Did she go to college or--
Speaker 1: No, no.  Daisy went as far as the tenth grade.  Melvin went as far as the eighth grade.  I was the first person in the family to finish high school.
Speaker 2: Okay.  I wondered if--was she, was she a member of these middle class women's clubs like the Links and that--
Speaker 1: Not--
Speaker 2: --sort of thing.
Speaker 1: No, no, mm-mm, no, the only real middle-class connection she had, as I say, was when she came across town to Mt. Zion Congregational Christian Church and took me over there so that I could become associated with a different class of folk, particularly folk my age, because the folk my age in the neighborhood, at least in her, to her way of thinking--and a lot of this is, is supposition and conjecture, but to her way of thinking, they probably would not go much further than they were.  And clearly, she had something different in mind for me, whatever that was.  I am sure that she wanted me to continue schooling as long as possible.  I am sure, as I think about it now, that she wanted me to have a position instead of a job.  And I'm sure that, as I reflect on some other things, she had plans or designs, or at least ideas, of what kind of woman I should marry and what that woman should bring to the table.  That's okay.
Story_ID: 55489
Speaker 1: Okay, now did--now did you ever get a sense of who your parents actually were or, or--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, my birth mother was Jewish, Ashkenazi.  And I had her name.  Oh, let's see.  I suppose that sometime in the--I know it was not until--wait a minute; let me think here for a second.  No, I believe I knew her name before Daisy died.  Yeah, I'm pretty sure I knew her name before Daisy died.  But I didn't get the complete history until a number of years after Daisy died, when I wrote to Cuyahoga County Welfare Department to get that information.  My father was black.  I'm not exactly sure of the kind of relationship that existed between them, whether daddy was a rolling stone or whether they had some acquaintance--prior acquaintance.  I do know, or I, I did find out later, that when Sarah Adele got pregnant with me, her father evicted her, okay.  And don't remember the name right off the top of my head of the--it was basically a Jewish home for unwed mothers.  And it had a, a formal name that I remember that much.  I probably even got it in the document at home, but I don't remember it.  And, let's see.  I do know I did find out that my birth mother, this Sarah Adele, didn't really wanna give me up for adoption, but she had no real choice.
Speaker 1: What was last name spelled like?
Speaker 2: M-A-R-K-S, Marks.  As I said, she didn't want to, but she didn't have a choice.  And I do know that subsequent to my birth, she--I had a sister a couple of years--born a couple of years after I was.  And then I believe sometime in the late '40s [1940s], early '50s [1950s] she did marry a black man, whether it was the same one who fathered all of her children, I don't know.  She died in, what, '88 [1988], '89 [1989], somewhere around in there I believe.
Speaker 1: And she was from Cleveland?  She lived in Cleve--in Cleveland?
Speaker 2: She lived in Cleveland, yeah.
Speaker 1: And did you ever meet her?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: No, okay.
Speaker 2: No, as, as I say, I didn't really get the information on her that I had until after she was deceased.
Story_ID: 55490
Speaker 1: This a--(unclear) (unclear)--all this aside, how did, how did--as you were on the verge of going to high school, you know, what did, what did you--were you then thinking about becoming a teacher?  Is, is that when you--
Speaker 2: Well, I became--as I say, I made that decision when I was 13.  I was in the library at Patrick Henry Junior High School.  And that was an interesting kind of thing because Empire Junior High School was much closer to the house.  But it was on the west side of 105th Street.  And because I lived on the east side of 105th Street, I had to go to the Patrick Henry that was in a ethnic white neighborhood that was in transition.  And I remember the first day I showed up for junior high there was this long green stripe painted down the middle of the sidewalk.  And we later were told that it was green paint that was covering over chalked or painted remarks, "Niggers, keep out," okay.  Now, I know I wasn't the first black child to attend Patrick Henry; I'm reasonably sure of that.  But apparently there was a bunch of us that were transferred to the Patrick Henry right about the same time.  And this would have been in '52 [1952].  And there was, there was tension in the air, okay.
Story_ID: 55491
Speaker 1: But as I say, it was in the, in the library at Patrick Henry Junior High School I remember I was reading a book on the pyramids, okay.  And it was just one of those epiphanist moments when you look up and you say, yeah, okay, that's what I wanna do with the rest of forever, okay.
Speaker 2: And that was to study ancient history, to study Egypt or?
Speaker 1: Just to study.  I mean, as, as I marked to you earlier on that one of the things I have is a kind of insatiable curiosity, everything from cereal boxes to encyclopedias to whatever, okay.  My wife sometimes says I read too much, but--(unclear)--get my nose out of a book and realize--but that's, yeah, okay.  But it's, it's one way of retrieving information about the world, okay.  And it's also a way of vicariously experiencing some things that I'm not mobile enough or won't live long enough to appreciate.  So I do it vicariously.
Speaker 2: And you mentioned before that you, around the family dinner table, table, had a conversation--you announced that the ancient Egyptians were black and--
Speaker 1: I believe--
Speaker 2: --there was silence all around, that--
Speaker 1: Yeah, I believe that part of what had got that going was I sort of kind of remember my mother taking me to see "The Ten Commandments."  I believe the movie was released in 1950.
Speaker 2: Fifty-six [1956]--(unclear)--
Speaker 1: Was it?  Yeah, I'm not sure.  But I seemed to have that, that memory.  But, but anyway, yeah, I just, out of the blue--(unclear)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--anywhere (unclear)--
Speaker 1: (Unclear)--you know, the Egyptians were black, just like that.  And [deep breath], okay, and--
Speaker 2: There were, you know, black characters in the movie, you know, a lot of black--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --Egyptians--(unclear)--
Speaker 1: Yes, yeah, but this was, this was before.  And I remember that--no, and later on, many years later, I understood their, their response.  They'd both come out of the South where a black male showing any kind of independence, showing any kind of intelligence was, as Billie Holiday said, a candidate for strange fruit hanging from Southern trees, okay.  So they were worried.  And yeah, I seem to remember my share of lectures about being uppity.  Yeah, yeah, I seem to remember those.
Speaker 2: Did you think you were smart when you were a kid?  Did you really think you were smart?
Speaker 1: Yes and no.  Yeah, I knew some things that other people did not know.  I wouldn't say that I was at the top of the heap in terms of raw, naked intelligence, but I wasn't that far down.  Yeah, I knew I was reasonably bright.
Speaker 2: I just wondered why your parents would say that, that you would--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --they thought you were kind of arrogant or saw whatever--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: No, not arrogant.
Speaker 2: --but, but--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Well, not arrogant.  What, what, what--
Speaker 1: Uppity.
Speaker 2: --would you use?  Up--Uppity.
Speaker 1: Uppity, yeah, and uppity in the sense that they talked about, would be in terms of: boy, don't let your mouth get your ass in trouble now, okay?
Speaker 2: I've heard that.
Speaker 1: Yeah, right.  Now, they would not have phrased it in exactly in that manner, you understand, okay.  But the message was clear.
Speaker 2: So you had strong opinions you're saying, and--
Speaker 1: I had my share, yeah.  I didn't always voice them, but--
Story_ID: 55492
Speaker 1: So, so you, you had strong opinions.
Speaker 2: Yeah, but I wouldn't always voice them, okay.  I mean, when I think back, I was probably more quiet, and reserved, and shy; I'm still kind of shy.  And it's funny because I'm in an occupation that requires one to perform.  And don't ever let anyone tell you that teachers do not perform.  They perform, okay; they act.  And what I see in myself is that a lot of that public performance masks my shyness.  And I'm not really gonna volunteer information, even when I can look over there and say, umm, mm, okay, no, no, all right, because there's no real reward in embarrassing someone just for the sake of embarrassing them, okay.  So even though if I knew someone was loud and wrong, okay, it wasn't--I didn't have the right to--yeah, I might make a comment--(unclear)--okay.  I might maybe later on down the road suggest in a different situation that, hey, you know, you could've done that a little bit differently than you did it when you did it kind of thing.
Speaker 1: But if you were asked for your opinion, did you give it?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, and you're pretty honest like this?
Speaker 2: I would like to believe that that was the case, okay, but truth is always in the eye of the beholder, always a function of the belief system you embrace.
Speaker 1: Now, I'd like to ask you this: how did this--how did your personality translate into success in school?  Did you--was school--were you a success in--
Speaker 2: No (laughter).
Speaker 1: --grade school?
Speaker 2: No, I was a C student.  And you have to remember that grades are about schooling, okay.  They're part of the, part of the minutia, part of the, the trappings of schooling, okay.  They really don't have anything to do with getting an education.  And the first thing to be served for me was my curiosity, okay.  So I went to, I went to school basically because I had to, at least until I was sixteen, 'cause the state said so, because my parents insisted that I do that.
Story_ID: 55493
Speaker 1: But I would say that I probably spent an equal amount of time either listening to old radio shows, "Playhouse 90," that sort of thing, even some of the serials that came on the radio in the late '40s [1940s] and early '50s [1950s] because I have a suspicion--it seems to me we were the last family on the block to get TV, all right.
Speaker 2: A lot of people say that.
Speaker 1: Okay, you know, we were the last family on the block to get TV.  And I would say that, while I watched it, okay, ehhh, okay.  I mean it was cool to see the scenery fall on Captain Video's head, okay.  It was wild to listen to "Tom Corbett Space Cadet," okay.  But, you know, I mean when I was a child, every time I went home for lunch, it was Aunt Jenny and the Romance of Helen Trent on the radio during the lunch hour as my mother fixed whatever I was gonna eat and listened to her soaps.  So yeah, yeah, yeah.
Story_ID: 55494
Speaker 1: So, so when you're making the transition to high school, you know, did, did--well, when you got into high school, did this trend continue?  Did you still ki--kind of this--you know, make adequate grade--you know, mediocre grades, but just had this high curiosity--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --and energy.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, like I say, I was a C student.
Speaker 1: All right.  All the way through?
Speaker 2: In high school and in college.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: When I finally got to college, I, I was a C student in college too.  But it was--yeah, as I said earlier on, for me there's a difference between school and education, okay.  And yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, now, were there ways that you expressed your newfound knowledge or, or a way that you express--did, did it come out in an artistic expression?  Did it come out in--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Can you draw or write--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --when you were a kid or?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Did you--I mean--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: No.  I mean I've got, I've got a term paper I wrote in the ninth grade somewhere in my files that I remember.  It was actually pretty poor, as I think about it now.  But it was almost as if I was still gathering, still soaking up, kind of thing.
Speaker 1: Did you have like mentors in grade school or high school that, that you (unclear)--think really encouraged you to, to--
Speaker 2: I did in high school, okay.
Speaker 1: Now, where did you go to high school?
Speaker 2: Glenville, the old Glenville High School [Cleveland, Ohio].  The new one that is--the one that I went to I suspect had been built right around the turn of the century, turn of the 20th century.  And I remember that most of my teachers, for the most part, were old, white men.  And yeah, there was, there was a sprinkling of younger teachers coming in.  It seems to me they came primarily--they started to come maybe about the time I hit the eleventh grade, somewhere around in there, okay, 'cause I can remember--and it's kind of funny because the other day I pulled out the old high school yearbook just to, to, to look through it.  And I could remember--let's see.  It was a literature teacher by the name of Nike [ph.] Holdie [ph.]; there was William Appling [ph.], who was the choral director; Oliver Deeks [ph.], who was the principal; and let's see--Senorita Humphreys, yeah, I probably got more encouragement from Senorita Humphreys than I did from anyone else.
Speaker 1: Was she your Spanish teacher?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah, she's the one who basically told me that I could do whatever, quite a contrast from the Latin teacher, who was also the guidance counselor, who made it crystal clear to me that my future was a mop bucket and a broom.  But yeah, that's, that was Glenville High School--52 people in my graduating class.
Speaker 1: Sort of small grad--graduating class.
Speaker 2: Well, there were only 800 and some students in high school at the time, in January of 1958.  And I worked through high school, because my father had retired from the postage office, disability retirement in 1955.  And basically he said to me that he did not have the kind of money that he felt was necessary, so I was gonna have to get a job after school.  And that job was with Ruben Drug.  And I worked the first year I was in high school fifty-seven hours a week for fifty five cents an hour.
Story_ID: 55495
Speaker 1: There, there were still--obviously, there, there were Jewish shops in the community.  And yeah, at one time I, I have little doubt that it was much more of a Jewish neighborhood than when I moved into it.
Speaker 2: Okay, was Ruben Drugs like a family owned--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Yes, yeah, yeah, Ruben was the owner.  Let's see.  Reggie was the pharmacist, yeah.  Reggie was the pharmacist.
Speaker 2: Reggie Ruben or--
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: No, Reggie was a brother.
Speaker 2: All right, all right.
Speaker 1: Reggie was a brother.  He was a pharmacist.  He smoked three packs--maybe four packs--of Craven A's a day.   And he was gay--first time I'd ever met anyone who was gay, at least to my knowledge; and there was June, who was--who--she worked behind the counter, and let's see; there was Jackson, who later would go on to buy the drugstore, but he was kind of a janitor/deliveryman, that sort of thing.
Speaker 2: And re--he--and he went on to buy the drug?
Speaker 1: Yes.  Yeah, he went on to buy the drugstore, yeah.  But was it the last time I went through the old neighborhood--must have been back in the '80s [1980s].  And by then the drugstore was, was closed, was shuttered, abandoned basically.
Speaker 2: So, sir, did you work your whole--the entire time you were in high school?
Speaker 1: No, I was, I was at Ruben Drug for 18 months.  As I say, the first year was 57 hours a week for 55 cents an hour.
Speaker 2: While you were in school.
Speaker 1: While I was in school.  I started work at 3:30.  I worked until 11 Monday through Friday.  I worked all day Saturday and all day Sunday, okay.  And after a year I got fired.  I'm not exactly sure--oh, I know what it was.  It was too much.  It was too much.  My father went back down to the drugstore with me.  He talked with Old Man Ruben, got my job back, got my hours cut.  I stayed for another six months and then I left, went to work at the Superior branch of the Cleveland Public Library.  I must have stayed there maybe a year, and then I went to work at Kresge's [Five and Dime Store].
Story_ID: 55496
Speaker 1: Now, let's pause here a second.  Here's a reader who has a lot of curiosity.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --get a job in the library.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: How did you like that?
Speaker 2: I learned a lot.  I learned a lot about how libraries are organized, okay.  The librarian was an older, light skinned black woman.  I'm not sure where she went to library school, but she had her ways and we didn't really get along, okay.  But basically I was a page.  I shelved books for maybe two or three hours after school.  I had to take the bus to get there.  But yeah, I learned some things, did get a chance to do a fair amount of reading.  Oh yes, but eventually I left there and I went to the dime store.
Speaker 1: At Kresge's, right?
Speaker 2: Kresge's.
Speaker 1: Which is not Kmart (unclear).
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  And I got fired from there in December of '57 [1957], because of illness.  And because I couldn't show up during the Christmas rush they fired me.  So then I went on to, to graduate.  And as I say--as I said earlier on, because I could not find a job--had no real marketable skill--daddy said might as well go see what the military got to offer, son.
Speaker 1: Well--
Speaker 2: I--two weeks out of high school.
Story_ID: 55497
Speaker 1: So let me go back high school for minute.  Did you have it--were you engaged in any extracurricular activities in high school?  Did you--or did you play an instrument or sports or?
Speaker 2: I played the drum in the band; I was a gym leader; I was a radio operator.  I'm sure there were some other things, but even then, I was a person on the periphery.  I wasn't part of the, the in-groups, so to speak.  And I don't know that I really minded.  I thought more about it later on, but during the time, I can't quite--I can't say for sure that I really minded what was happening.
Speaker 1: So you, you really didn't feel like you fit into in--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --any particular group in--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --in the--
Speaker 2: Un-un.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you have friends and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah, I had some friends, a lot more associates, but one or two friends.  And yeah, but as I say, I didn't really have a particular clique or clan that I ran with.
Speaker 1: Now, what was your social life like?  Were, were you--
Speaker 2: What social life?
Speaker 1: --were you dating and--
Speaker 2: What social life?
Speaker 1: Oh--(unclear)--some people-I didn't, but the other people might, but--so I'm asking you did you, did you date in high school?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Did you get involved in that kind of stuff?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No, no, not really.  There was one young lady when I was in the twelfth grade who used to wait for me at the corner of Greenlawn and Parkwood, 'cause Glenville was located on Parkwood, about eight blocks north of the house.  And she used to wait for me so I could walk her to school, okay.  And whatever might have been between us did not materialize, did not.
Speaker 1: But did you enjoy talking to her or she did--was it just a one-sided thing?
Speaker 2: I don't even remember now, you know.  I really don't remember.
Story_ID: 55498
Speaker 1: So on the verge of, of high school graduation, did you, you, you saw that--you kind of felt that your, your best opt--option was the military?
Speaker 2: Well, interestingly enough, what I--the, the, the one thing I, I really do remember I talk about it.  I even talk about it with my students from time to time.  I remember having gone to a graduation party, not sure where it was, but I know it was south because the bus--I took the bus home.  It was one of those dark January nights in Cleveland [Ohio] that you have to experience to believe, okay.  And I don't remember now the name of the park.  But the bus was coming south--it was coming north on 105th Street.  And I passed the park because the Museum of Natural History is in the park now, but, but I've forgotten the name of the park.  It wa--and little bit farther along was also Mt. Zion Congregational Church.  But I remember at the moment we passed the park looking over to my right, and it was so bleak and so barren, and it was cold.  And in some ways that just seemed to summarize where I was at the time.  So as I said, a couple of weeks later, papa said go see what the military has to offer, because you're out of school now.  And the only way you can stay here is to contribute, okay.  I carried you as far as I can carry you.  And I don't have any money for you to go to college.  I remember going to, what?  I think I went to the Army recruiting office first.  Crawling around in the mud just didn't turn me on; Air Force didn't excite me.  Next day I went back downtown, went to the Navy recruiter first--old chief petty officer: "You got time to take this test?"--blew it away.  "Ah, I got another here.  I wonder if you'd be willing to stay a little bit longer?"--blew that one away.  My man talked a good game.  I went home.  My mother was in the kitchen.  I said, "Hey, mom, guess what?  I joined the Navy today.  "Mother, what are you doing on the floor?"--okay, that kind of thing.  Yeah, about three weeks later, I was on my way to Great Lakes Naval Training Center, north of Chicago.  Damn, it was cold.  It was 20 below when we got to Great Lakes, 'cause I went there in February--cold coffee, limp bacon, frigid baked beans, corn bread at 0:400 when I arrived.  Four years, three months, and fifteen days later I was out.  I had saved enough money to at least pay for my first year of college.
Story_ID: 55499
Speaker 1: --you went by the Navy so fast that there had to be some memories there.  It though--may not be pleasant.  I don't know.  You, you wanna tell us some Navy stories.  You, did you fit in anywhere in the Navy?
Speaker 2: No, no, not really.  I understood that I had to play the game according to their rules, and I did, okay.  I also managed to move from E1 to E5 in four years.  I was almost--I was, what, two or three months short of being eligible for E6.  I was an aviation fire control technician--electronics, computers, hydraulics, mechanics.  The Navy had only desegregated ten years earlier.  It was racist up the ying yang, the one time in my life where I probably came closest to killing someone with my bare hands, discovered at that moment--another one of those epiphanist moments--that we all have the potential to kill.  And it is undoubtedly the angriest I have ever been in my life.  It was a kind of anger that scared me to the point where I realized that either I learn to manage it or it was gonna manage me, okay.
Speaker 1: So what happened?  What, what, what was it that, that created this--that generated all this anger?
Speaker 2: Young, little silly ass white boy who did not know his place.  I picked him up off the ground, held him above my head and attempted to put him to through the side of an airplane.  It took four people to pull me off of him--scared him too.
Speaker 1: What did he do to make you that angry?
Speaker 2: It was easily--I don't remember exactly.  It was something he said or something that he did, but I know it was not kind.  I know that much.  I remember that much.  But that's one of those kinds of thing you repress, okay?
Speaker 1: Yes, sir.
Story_ID: 55500
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, I, I knew some good people.  I knew some not so good people too.  It was an old chief petty officer in my shop who taught me how to play chess.  It was a place where because of sea duty you could easily read a couple of hundred books a year, okay.  And contrary to the popular image, the books got passed around, okay.  Yeah, sure, it'd mean you go ashore.  And all you're interested in is, is booze and girls, okay.  But that wasn't always the case for me.  I would wander off the beaten path, the places where only Japanese was spoken.  I managed to find a couple of little jazz clubs-in Asakusa that I don't even know whether I could find my way back to 'em the next time I was in, in port, you know.  But yeah--or I would go do the cultural things, 'cause as a chief pointed out to me, you know, pretty soon what you'll discover is how tired you get of drinking and fucking, okay.  And that's the way it was.  It didn't take long, a couple of days.  And maybe it was the fact that the environment was staggered to exploit you in only those two aspects of you.  And there's more to me than that, okay.  So yeah, I took the train to other places.  I took the train, I went to Yokohama one night.  I remember this little old lady in the Grand Hotel in Yokohama.  I had just come out the barbershop.  She's from Dubuque, Iowa--"Oh, what a wonderful sight to see our young men here to defending our country."  Lady, please--let me out of here, okay--ah yeah, Hong Kong, Guam, the P.I [Prince Island]., Dixie Station off the coast of South Vietnam, 1961.  My mother sent me a newspaper clipping, 'cause they wouldn't tell us where we were.  She sent me a newspaper clipping.  I still have it.  It's a photograph or a drawing, a map of my ship on Dixie Station, or what would become Dixie Station.
Speaker 2: But they didn't tell you what it was--
Speaker 1: No, no.
Speaker 2: --when you were on the ship?
Speaker 1: No, no, no.  Oh, there are tales to tell.  But there was a lot of unpleasantness.  Yet at the same time, I would have to say that overall it was a positive experience for me in terms of what I learned, not only about other people, other cultures, even when I learned about the United States, but more importantly, probably what I learned about myself, once again, mostly in the sense of information acquisition that hadn't yet been interpreted, that would come later.  That would come later.
Speaker 2: So when, when your, your term was up, were you an--anxious to get out and--
Speaker 1: Oh yeah. I mean, my division said, look, here's the deal:  We really wanna keep you, okay.  You ship for six.  We'll see that you get your first three Atsugi Naval Air Station just north of Tokyo, because they knew I liked Japan.  I could make myself understood, reasonably understood in Japa--in Japanese.  And then they said, when you finish that, we'll send you back to the States to B school.  I'd been to A school. They would send me to B school. I said thanks, but no thanks.  I decided that what I want to do is go to college.  I promised my mother I would go to college, and that's what I plan to do.  I got the money now, so.
Story_ID: 55501
Speaker 1: So you came back to Cleveland [Ohio]?
Speaker 2: I came back to Cleveland [Ohio].  I was there for a couple of months.  I got hooked up with this one young lady.  We broke up because she went to Western Reserve and I went to Kent State.  I'm sure there were some other facts involved, but that's the one I remember most prominently--good middle-class child.
Speaker 1: Yeah, the Western Reserve is a--noted as a sort of a higher level--institution of higher learning in Ohio, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it, it, it was clearly a place--well, I mean Western Reserve was one of those.  Kent State was a teacher's college.
Speaker 1: A state school.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, it was a teacher's college.  It used to be a normal school.  And there was a prestige thing involved.  There was a class kind of thing involved, if you would.
Speaker 1: Is this a young lady you met in church when you were--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --younger or--
Speaker 2: No, I knew her--she was in high school.  She--we went to the same high school.  When I came back, what, I was a senior when she was a freshman I believe, something like that, okay.  And yeah, we dated for the summer and maybe a couple of times when she went off to Western Reserve [Case Western Reserve University] and I went off to Kent [State University].  And then come January of, what, '63 [1963] splitsville.
Story_ID: 55502
Speaker 1: Let me ask you this.  This is--you're in the Navy I guess during the, during the seminal period of the Civil Rights Movement, Dr. King, Dr. Martin Luther King's Montgomery Bus Boycott.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And, you know--
Speaker 2: Well, after.  It, it was after.  That, that stuff took place in the South.  That didn't have anything to do with me.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you, you felt, you felt removed from that?
Speaker 2: Yeah, very much so.
Speaker 1: And your parents really didn't talk about--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --racial issues--
Speaker 2: No, no, not at all.
Speaker 1: I'm just trying to find--I'm fishing around for what--if you had--if there was something like spark of, of cultural identity in you at this point, and did you see--you know, were you--did, did you have some po--political--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --process to--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --to your situation in the United States at that time?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm, no.
Speaker 1: So even after the Navy you pretty much didn't--
Speaker 2: Until I got laid up in the hospital because I had injured my back in the Navy.  And let's see.  I know I had spent some time in the VA [Veterans Affairs] hospital in Cleveland [Ohio].  And let's see.  This must have happened at Kent.  Either I aggravated it or it was the knee that I'd also messed up in the Navy.  But I remember being hospitalized, reading John Hope Franklin's "From Slavery to Freedom."  I'm not sure what motivating reason was for that.
Speaker 1: Did someone give you the book?  I know you--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Go buy it yourself?
Speaker 2: No, I got it from the library.  And I do remember--come to think of it, I remember a question that my American history teacher asked me in high school, if I knew what the Emancipation Proclamation was.  I said no.  I remember saying no to him.  And he explained--I believe he explained to me--this is a white high school teacher.  Because it wasn't--there was no discussion.  There was no real discussion of the black experience in any of the texts that I had through--during my tour of the Cleveland public schools, except for Booker T. [Washington], George W. [Washington Carver] and Little Black Sambo who chased the tiger around the tree until it turned into butter.  That was it.
Speaker 1: The message from the other two was basically what?  What did you get from the presentation of the other two figures, Booker T. [Washington] and George Washington Carver?  What do you think the purpose of them exposing you to those two in--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: They were safe.  They knew their place, okay.  The attitude was one of the black experience wasn't that important; ergo, how can we justify expending resources on it?  It's one of the curiosities of going to school in a quote defacto segregated environment, okay, in the sense that they're all part of the same culture, at least, you know, later on when I was involved with a woman who had gone to school in the South, at least in her schooling there'd been a whole presentation of a black heritage.
Speaker 1: Did she go to a black school?  Was that why you think?
Speaker 2: I believe she told me that she was in the twelfth grade before she got her first white teacher.  I was in the fourth grade when I got my first black teacher, by which time I'd learned to read.
Story_ID: 55503
Speaker 1: You're--now, as you're recuperating in the hospital with these Navy back--induced back spasms, you're reading John Hope Franklin's "From Slavery to Freedom."  And you, you ever get into--
Speaker 2: That's a difficult book to read.  And later on John [Hope Franklin] and I had conversation.  Dr. Franklin and I had conversation about another book and that idea of--when I say it was difficult to read, I don't mean in terms of its content, okay, but it was difficult in that it was not exciting reading.  It didn't--you know, it's, it's academic prose with a vengeance, okay.  If you look at, say, Lerone Bennett's "Before the Mayflower," Bennett being a journalist, he writes very differently than Franklin does, okay.  That's the sense in which I mean it was difficult to read.  The information, in and of itself, was fascinating, okay.  Some of it, interestingly enough, I had figured out by myself even before--so, reading Franklin was more confirmation of what I had picked up, you know, when I talked about absorbing information all those early years.  It was basically about picking it up, acquiring it, all right.  But actually, if I had to name a catalytic event, I came home in January of '62 [1962] to go to my sister's high school graduation 'cause I told her I would be there, okay.
Story_ID: 55504
Speaker 1: And while I was there I heard Brother Malcolm [X] for the first time.  He was being interviewed by Louis Lomax.  And as I told my students the other day, it was, on the one hand, exciting, yet terrifying.  But yeah, so we got Malcolm [X]; then we got John Hope Franklin; then we got some other things.  Even--
Speaker 2: Now, you mentioned Louis Lomax.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Could you maybe, just for the sake of the record, explain who--
Speaker 1: He was--let's see.  Lomax was, what, he was a journalist I believe, conservative, as I recall.
Speaker 2: He was black, right?
Speaker 1: Yeah, he's a black journalist.  He was a Conservative.  And I'm not exactly sure of the circumstances of the interview, but I do remember--'cause I'm pretty sure I still have a copy of it--a book Lomax wrote called "The Negro Revolution," I believe.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: And yeah, I--
Speaker 2: "The Negro Revolt."
Speaker 1: "The Negro Revolt," yeah.  I have a copy of that, and I believe that may have been--'cause he was writing about the sit-ins; he was writing about the bus boycott; the formation of SCLC [Southern Christian Leadership Conference] and, and some other thing.  And it seems to me that may have been the reason that he was selected to interview Malcolm, yeah.
Speaker 2: So, you saw Malcolm X in the context of an interview--was it live?
Speaker 1: It was radio.
Speaker 2: On the radio?
Speaker 1: On the radio.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, you gotta remember that I came up in a time when radio was much more important than television, because it allowed you to use your imagination much more than the, the TV would allow, okay, yeah.  So, yeah, there it was.
Speaker 2: So at the time you heard him had you ever seen him?
Speaker 1: No--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --did not know who he was.  But to hear him speak, oh, it was marvelous, just truly marvelous.
Speaker 2: Mm, in what sense?  What did he, what did he have to say that really touched you?
Speaker 1: It was just so--it, it was the power of his words; it was the style, the speaking style, you know.  In a sense, he was like the old Baptist preachers that in some respect I had grown up with before I was relocated to the Congregational Christian Church, okay, and to the Methodist folk that were part of my early youth.  But Malcolm had a speaking style like that, but Malcolm challenged people, okay.  And a number of the things he said raised questions for me.  And yeah, that may have been the beginning of my own ideological odyssey to where I am now.
Speaker 2: Did you feel challenged in, in--
Speaker 1: Oh yes.
Speaker 2: --in a sense after you heard--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Oh yes, absolutely, challenged in the sense of--as I told my students now: don't believe a thing I have to say until you have taken the opportunity to check it out for yourself.  Like all college professors, I lie.  My mortgage payment is dependent on it, okay.  So, in a sense, I needed to check the brother out.  I needed to find out how much veracity there was.  I had heard stories.  I had hints.  You know, it was more a thing of learning from the absence of information than presence of fact, okay.  And I needed to check that out, and I did.  I started.
Speaker 2: So he, he kicked in that old curiosity?
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: And made you run to information--
Speaker 1: Made me run--
Speaker 2: --that you--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --to the library, okay, yeah, yeah.  And fortunately, there was a book here, and a book there, and a book over there, one over there, and maybe three or four here.
Story_ID: 55505
Speaker 1: And can you name some of those books and what, what impact they had on you?
Speaker 2: Well, of course, Franklin's "Slavery of Freedom," that, that was really the only one that was there.  Seems to me I remember "Souls of Black Folk."  I'm reasonably sure I also read Booker T. [Washington], "Up From Slavery."  And let's see.  There were a bunch of others.  I might even have come across Frazier, E. Franklin Frazier.  There were some other things I know in the Kent State [University] library that I ran across, okay.  And there was also, during my freshman year at Kent [State University], The Hub, where all the black folk would gather to talk and play bid whist.  And it's a game I've not ever learned how to play.  And yeah, yeah.  When I went to college I promised my mother I would stay in the dormitory for my first year.  I was six years older than one of my roommates and five years older than the other.
Speaker 1: Did that, that equate into some sort of a difference in an approach to life or?
Speaker 2: Probably, I'm sure it did.  Because when I went to college, I was not in college to earn a degree, per se.  I was there to get learning.  And I remember an argument I had with one English professor.  Even though he gave me an A on the paper, for a paper I wrote called "Dawn Launch" that was a description of my flight off the USS Midway and recovery cat shot, arrested landing.  And he gave me an A on the paper, but I argued with him because he didn't put any comments.  I didn't get a whole lot of feedback on the paper, and what I was interested was in becoming a better writer, okay.  I started in science--started college in science, so I fancied myself going into pediatrics.  But after two years of chemistry and mathematics, the sterility, I, I couldn't fit.  It was, it was not--yeah, I knew the stuff, but it was not what I wanted to do for the rest of forever.  And I had taken a couple of psychology courses and finally wound up with a B.A. in, in psychology.  And eventually I would go on--but then at the same time I also realized that psychology was not enough.  It did not offer enough breadth or depth for what I wanted to know, okay.
Speaker 1: Now, when, when you were at Kent State did you, did you familiarize yourself with the history department there, 'cause I know at that time--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --they--they, the focus on black history was strong although was guided by two white professors.
Speaker 2: I don't--I may be wrong, but I suspect they came after I left.
Speaker 1: Okay, so did they--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I thought they were there when you--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: No, I don't believe they were there when I was there.
Speaker 1: And we're talking about-
Story_ID: 55506
Speaker 1: I left Kent in '66 [1966], okay.  The thing I remember the most about Kent is sharing Kent State University with Goodyear Tire and Rubber from 3:30 to midnight, five nights a week.  And the first time--the first week I was working there, the drawings, the caricatures, the, the broom with the, the drawing on it, okay, that was put out by all of the white folks that worked the dayshift--'cause I worked the nightshift--who were in some ways uncomfortable that someone black was moving into their sanctum sanctorum.  And I made them uncomfortable.   My presence made them uncomfortable because it challenged a lot of their preconceived allusions.  And after a couple of days I went to the manager of the lab where I was working.  I said this shit gotta stop now, okay.  That was in '63 [1963].  I started working at Goodyear in '63 [1963], stayed till '66 [1966], when I graduated.  And yeah, I had 22 sick days a year, 14 vacation days, 11 holidays--took 'em all every year, every one of 'em, either to prepare for exams or because I just got tired of their bullshit, okay.  And as I say, I got the, the B.A. in psychology, left Goodyear the following September.  I graduated in August.  In September I was teaching school at--(unclear)--Retarded Children--boy, oh boy, the labels that we put on people--the labels we put on people.  So, there was that.
Story_ID: 55507
Speaker 1: Are you--is it--do I take it to mean that you're saying that the retarded children weren't necessarily retarded?
Speaker 2: No, no, what we would call culturally deprived.  It's this whole fiction that we can design a school system that will meet the needs of all of its attendees.  That's a crock of shit, okay.  And it's sad because there's a real difference between treating people equally and treating them as equals, and mass schooling treats people equally--not as equals, okay.  So I, I lasted there a year before my contract was not renewed.
Speaker 1: Let's go back--(unclear)--a second.
Speaker 2: Un-huh.
Speaker 1: I be--I think I understand what you said, but can you explain that, that mass education treats people--
Speaker 2: Equally?
Speaker 1: --e, e, equally, but not as equals?
Speaker 2: When you treat people equally, you dismiss whatever individual differences they bring to the table, okay.  You don't take folks where they are.  When you treat peoples as equals, you begin with the presumption that whatever they have to offer is whatever they have to offer.  And maybe what you'll need is compensatory programs in one sense, whether that compensatory program is gifted and talented or whether it's for slow learners.  But the point is that you don't make a priori determinations about a person before you meet 'em, okay, all right.  It's one of the ways in which when you wed yourself to a particular ideology, you blind yourself to the huge range of possibilities that exist in the Universe, okay, because whatever is excluded from the Universe of definition that supports a particular ideology cannot be perceived, cannot be believed, because you have no criteria for perception and belief, okay.  And that's the problem with schools.  They're designed by people who think they know based on their own experiences, their own beliefs, their own values, and they're addressed to groups that they don't know and whose needs they don't know, okay.  So what winds up is people get pushed out of school because they don't fit.  And they don't fit because the structure in which they are made to fit by compulsatary--compulsory--attendance laws--are more concerned with preserving order and domestic tranquility in the society than they are in addressing the needs of the people who are required to attend.
Speaker 1: Now--
Speaker 2: So that's, that's--fundamentally that's what that's about.
Story_ID: 55508
Speaker 1: Let me see if I can follow up and maybe get more specific here.  Are there things that--are there things that you see that black students need in school that are different from what, you know, American white pe--people (unclear)--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Absolutely, no question about it.  First of all, black people have got to stop being treated as if they're always on trial, okay.  They also have to stop being treated as representatives of a group about which we have concluded certain things.  We've got to stop treating black people, in this society in particular, as if their performers, court justice, okay.  And contrary to what certain officials who live in Washington, D.C., on certain streets, we have to cease being a colorblind society and become a color conscious society.  Because as long as we persist, as long as we parade, as long as we prate about being colorblind, we will continue to be a holy, totally, irretrievably racist society, okay.  Because if I say that I am colorblind, I am automatically and instantaneously dismissing you, okay--
Speaker 1: Okay, so you, you, you're saying then that it's society hasn't changed, and it's already a racist society.
Speaker 2: It's been a racist society since its inception.
Speaker 1: And then to say that it's--okay, to say that--all, all of a sudden to say now we're colorblind without changing the conditions or changing the approach, and that's--it's nothing really changes.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, okay.
Speaker 2: The more things change, the more they remain the same.
Speaker 1: Just so--just saying now we're col, col, colorblind is not enough.  A lot of other things have to change.
Speaker 2: When you--to be--to say that you're colorblind is the same thing the brothers say when they leap up on someone 'cause they been dissed.  Color--saying your colorblind is a way of dissing, okay, you know.  It's, it's of the same order of white folks saying, oh, I have a Negro friend, okay, all right.  It's the same kind of thing, okay.  It don't mean nothing.  It don't mean nothing at all.
Story_ID: 55509
Speaker 1: Let's move ahead, if, if, if you want.  Are you ready to move ahead?  Let's move ahead to grad school I guess, or if you--when you, when you finish talking about your experiencing this as a teacher in this school for retarded--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah well--
Speaker 1: --something about retarded--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I stayed--what was it?  I stayed in the Canton Public School System for a year.  And then I went off and I did a two-year tour as a rehabilitation counselor for the State of Ohio and then went and taught in the Upward Bound program.  And--what is it, October--must have been October of '69 [1969] I believe.  The students--and I was also part of a small community group during that period, from say, oh what--'66 [1966] to '70 [1970] I was living in Canton.  And we started a little community group, the Southeast Community Improvement Association.
Speaker 1: What was the purpose of that group?
Speaker 2: Same thing as a lot of other community groups, to--
Speaker 1: What's that?
Speaker 2: To bring people together, organize 'em.
Speaker 1: Around neighborhood issues?
Speaker 2: Yeah, neighborhood issues and, and larger issues as well.  Initially, I was the minister for information.  I'm not sure what possessed them to take on the Panther structure, okay.
Speaker 1: Or terminology like--
Speaker 2: Well, and--yeah, the structure and the terminology.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: But I was told that, that, that would be my function.  Basically, I was the propaganda minister.  That was the wrong move, because you can't be a propaganda minister if you're always asking questions about the propaganda, okay, all right.  So I was invited to depart from that position.  And they decided, the, the Council of Elders decided that I would probably make a much  better minister for education that allowed me to run a daycare center and, and a bookstore and things--
Story_ID: 55510
Speaker 1: --organization part of something larger or--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --or, was it--okay.
Speaker 2: It was a local organization.  But it was on the police watch list, because that was time when--but anyway, in the fall of '68 [1968], the students at the high school, Canton McKinley High School, decided that they wanted courses in black history and black culture, so they came to the, to the organization--to the community organization.  And they said we want you to go with us to the school board and argue for--okay.  The school board, after much hemming and hawing, said well, we're willing, but whoever comes in to teach it has to be able to meet the minimal certification requirements specified by the State of Ohio, okay.  Besides, I had already taught in the system, so they knew I had the degree and I--okay.  So I--for several months I taught history and culture, okay.  And what was funny is it gave you an idea of how much students were into images.  Because I didn't really dress then different than I do now, okay.  And in the students' minds I should have had on my bib overalls, and my combat boots, and my blue work shoot--shirt; I should have had hair all over my head, my granny glasses, and every fourth word out of my mouth was supposed to be motherfucka, okay. And I, I remember saying during one period, I said look, you talk about all of this image stuff.  What you gonna do if a brother with a process walks into your headquarters.  He's got his pants belted up around his armpits, you know, sharkskin--shiny sharkskin pants.  He got these pointed-toed shoes, okay.  He reaches into his pocket and pulls out a roll that would choke a horse.  Now, you need money for the revolution that you keep talking about, right?  How you gonna relate to this brother if you're hung up in images only?  "You're wrong man"--okay, so much for my high school teaching.
Story_ID: 55511
Speaker 1: So it didn't, didn't work out.  You--
Speaker 2: No, it didn't work actually, because it was--I was only doing it part time, and then I got a full-time job in the next community as a city planner, because at the time I was a graduate student at the University of Akron [Akron, Ohio].  I had started in the Department of Sociology, but they were uncomfortable with the master's thesis I wanted to do on the ghetto riots.  And--
Speaker 1: Just what riots were you--
Speaker 2: Sixty-four [1964] to six--the long hot summers of '64[1964] to '67 [1967].
Speaker 1: Okay, so those all over the country?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: And my whole argument was that they were a futile exercise in power.  Interestingly, what started as my M.A. thesis at Akron became my doctoral dissertation at Syracuse.  But I finished up at [University of] Akron with an M.A. in urban studies.  Then I was recruited to Utica College [Utica, New York] to teach in their new Center for Urban Studies.  And I went, and part of the deal was the opportunity to work on my doctorate at Syracuse--that I started in 1970, left Syracuse in '72 [1972] and came here.  My advisor did not speak with me for a year, good old Willie B. Lamouse-Smith, a Ghanaian by birth, trained at the University of Munster [Munster, Germany].  And he was angry with me, and we did not speak for a year because he wanted me to stay and finish.  Even though I had submitted the first draft of my dissertation before I left he wanted me to stay and finish.  I told him I had a family to support.  I finally went back and, and finished and graduated in '74 [1974] with a Ph.D. in social science.
Story_ID: 55512
Speaker 1: And so Mr. Lamouse, Dr. Lamouse-Smith, was sort of upset that you left without finishing.  And you went back--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and finished.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, now, what was he?  Was he like a mentor to you or, or?
Speaker 2: In some ways, yes.  He was trained in the German tradition, so he would not allow half stepping, okay.
Speaker 1: So one, one--once again, he was a Ghanaian--
Speaker 2: Ghanaian.
Speaker 1: --who went to the University of Munster [Munster, Germany].
Speaker 2: Munster [Germany].  Yeah, he took his doctorate in sociology at the University of Munster.  Now, he also, at the same, was possessed of inaccurate information about the black experience in the United States.  But he saw to it that I did what I was supposed to do to get through the program.
Speaker 1: Now, did he fight with you over--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: We, we had some disagreements.  Yeah, we had disagreements.  And actually, my suspicion is that when I started talking about my dissertation with him--what was it?  You've got the title of it there, "Ghetto Riots and the Employment of the Black Worker: A Search for Black Political Power?"  That's what it is.  And I was talking about looking at the ghetto riots of '64 [1964] to '67 [1967] through the--from the perspective of power, exercising power.  And I would have to say that primarily what he did was to help me get rid of a lot of the cobwebs in my thinking so that I could go much closer, much straighter much more quickly to the issues at hand.
Speaker 1: For instance?
Speaker 2: By forcing me to consider power and its meaning, okay, that power is not just power, okay.  There are the resources of power, only one of which is money, okay.  You can have money and not have power.  You cannot have power and not have money.  There are things like prestige, and influence, and expertise, and a whole host of other things.  There is the power to create the power to destroy.  There is the nus--the need to understand the asymmetrical distribution of power in society.  There is also the reality that the simplest definition of power there is is the ability to shape reality, something that all of us possess.  And we exercise it every time we make meaning of our experience.  So basically, you're coming out of that condoling--continental--tradition, as oppose to the American emphasis on scholastic--you know, it was--it enabled me more to take an interdisciplinary--multidisciplinary--perspective on the questions.  As [W.E.B.] Du Bois used to--as Du Bois used to say, "What we have to do is focus on the fundamental questions," okay.  And he was very much enamored of Du Bois and Oliver Cox and--
Story_ID: 55513
Speaker 1: Did he know Du Bois--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --personally?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: 'Cause I know DuBois died in (unclear)--
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No, but he was very much enamored of Du Bois, and--
Speaker 1: Du Bois went to school in Germany too.
Speaker 2: Right, yeah, University of Berlin, yep.
Speaker 1: And Oliver Cox is a librarian, right.  He's--
Speaker 2: No, no, Oliver Cromwell Cox, and Cox was black sociologist, who for many years taught at Lincoln [University] and then wound his career at Wayne State [University] in Detroit [Michigan].  And probably his most noted book is "Caste, Class, and Race," okay, but that was standard reading for Lamouse-Smith, Du Bois, Cox, whole host of people that would be considered today probably radical in their orientation.  I'm not sure, because you know those kinds of terms change with eras.
Story_ID: 55514
Speaker 1: And you had some organizing experience in Canton [Ohio], I guess, right?
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: And I don't know what styles on organizing you want to talk, but I know a lot of organizers say that power is organized money and organized people.  How do you feel about that?
Speaker 2: Yes and no, okay.  If you want to talk about organized people, what you have to realize is that most people are taught to believe.  Let me just say people are taught to believe that they're powerless, okay.  Well, what is clear to me is that the primary reason we tell ourselves that or we get told that is to keep us from realizing how powerful we really are.  Anyone who can create God--as the historical record makes clear, okay, God is always created in the image of the people who profess God, contrary to what the divines would have us believe.  But any people who can do that must be inordinately powerful, and perhaps that's the reason they run around telling themselves how powerless they are.  Because the truth of their power scares them.  It's like the incident I told you about from the Navy.  The anger that I exhibited at that moment, that is very much a resource of power could, could lead, as popular culture says, to the dark side, okay, of the force.  And who wants to be a real practitioner of the dark side of the force?
Speaker 1: Okay, I know it was popular in the '60s [1960s], especially during the '60's [1960s], early '70s [1970s], when you were teaching in the public schools in Canton [Ohio].  It was popular say that knowledge is power.
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: So how do you feel about that--(unclear)?
Speaker 2: Well, you gotta remember that knowledge is a social construct, okay.  Knowledge is the shaping of information to some specific purpose.  Accordingly, it is a construct of the consciousness.  And in so being, it is influenced by what are our prior beliefs, okay.  So, if I say that knowledge is power, what kind of power?  Whose power?  What kind of knowledge?  What you gonna do with it?  Do you understand that if you act in this way, you've got consequences?  Are you ready for the consequences, okay?  And there's a difference between reacting and responding, okay.  Are you prepared to do it?  What's the society?  If the society reacts, they might kill you.  If they respond, maybe all they do is they take away your toys, okay.  But the end result is essentially the same.  You're not gonna get what you want, so maybe you'd better be more clear about what it is you want.
Story_ID: 55515
Speaker 1: Okay, so, in, in your Ph.D. dissertation, did you, did you see--you said that black people who participated in those, those riots--(unclear)--they were called urban riots and some call 'em rebellions--did, did, did you see--you, you see them as futile attempts to--
Speaker 2: I--what I concluded was that the ghetto riots injudicious use of the talents of black people.  But given the situation in which they found themselves, it was one of the few things available, one of the few tools, one of the few instruments available to them to make known their displeasure with the way they were being treated.
Speaker 1: Okay, and, and what did people use?
Speaker 2: Guns, bullets, okay.  You have a society that is predicated on the principles of exclusion and exploitation.  You have a society whose very economic system means that anything and everything in that society is for sale.  You have a society that, on the one hand encourages competition so that you will not come to see that by focusing on your supposed opponent, you don't have the resources to pay attention to whoever wrote the rules of the competition in the first place.  You don't have the resources to understand that opportunity in the United States is differentially distributed along race, class, and gender lines, okay, that those in power seldom give up more than is necessary to maintain control, because control is requisite to the orderly exercise of authority, okay.
Speaker 1: Does, does power ever concede anything voluntarily?
Speaker 2: Not without a demand.
Speaker 1: Yeah--
Speaker 2: Mr. [Frederick] Douglass said that.
Speaker 1: It never has.
Speaker 2: [Frederick] Douglass made that clear in the "West Indian Emancipation" speech, delivered it to Canandaigua, New York in 1857.
Speaker 1: So, people who want power must do?
Speaker 2: They must first realize and recognize that they already have it, that what they must learn then how to do is use it, okay?
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, so it's that use of it.
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: --where we, we find the--
Speaker 2: That's, that's--
Speaker 1: --the--
Speaker 2: --part that takes a little bit of study, you see.  Go ahead.  'Cause you don't wanna go off halfcocked.
Speaker 1: We all have--meaning, I guess the lowest level of the use of that power is that destructive power you're talking about, that anger, that--
Speaker 2: It's so much easier to destroy--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --than it is to create.
Speaker 1: It's that explosion of anger.
Speaker 2: Yep.
Story_ID: 55516
Speaker 1: But to do more than that, what must we do?
Speaker 2: We must be visionaries.  We must remember that as the National Negro Anthem says: "We must learn from the faith that the dark past has taught us.  We must learn to utilize the hope that the present has brought us."  but we can't do either one of those unless we've got the vision thing, you know, okay.  And we have to remember what was being said by many of the folk in the '60s [1960s], that you gotta keep your eyes on the prize.  And the prize fundamentally is having a viable piece of the action, okay, without, as I said, having to perform, having to prove yourself every day, in every way--okay, all right--not having a place where you can exhale, okay, because you're always on stage, you're always performing, okay, all right.  You're always beating back the myths that the oppressors have built up about you, all right.
Story_ID: 55517
Speaker 1: Do you have any models or in--any models in, in, in, in how to engage in this struggle, you know, any, any model people now that you--that you look to?
Speaker 2: My parents probably, Melvin and Daisy.  They got me started.  And yeah, there have been mentors along the way.  John Henry Clarke is one that I learned more about black history from that man than--okay.  Because I learned an attitude about doing black history from Clarke, and--yeah, conversations, discussions that I've had with people over the years, bouncing ideas back and forth.
Speaker 1: And what did you learn from John Clarke and how do you put that to use?
Speaker 2: It's an attitude.  It's--you know, John in some way--Dr. Clarke I should say, to be--to give the man his propers.
Speaker 1: You can probably just spell his name, too, so people--
Speaker 2: C-L-A-R-K-E.  I was at the University of Denver the night Dr. Clarke became Dr. Clarke, okay.  He got an honorary degree from the University of Denver.  I was there.  And he used to compare himself--he didn't do it directly.  He did it indirectly by telling us the story of Mohammad, who was a camel driver, didn't have no formal schooling, okay.  But he trusted what his experience taught him.  He trusted what he learned.  And he reflected and he came to understand something that I utilize frequently.  Matter of fact, I even used it this morning in class when I told one of my young white students that you can learn from anyone.  But in the final analysis, you must become your own teacher, okay.  Yeah, that's what Clarke did.  His life was a living example of becoming your own teacher--didn't always get it right, okay, but what was important was he could tell you when he didn't get it correct and didn't cost his ego anything to tell you he had made a mistake, okay.  He wasn't afraid to make mistakes.  He understood that by making mistakes, that's one of the ways you learn, is to screw up, you see.  Of course the question I'm sure that someone will ask is whether you can recover from some of those screw-ups so that you can learn what went wrong, okay, ah yeah.
Story_ID: 55518
Speaker 1: Now, now, this is one of the key philosophical questions that was raised in the '60s [1960s] and '70s [1970s] and continues to be raised now in black studies and in ethnic studies, but particularly, specifically in the black studies.  And that's the question that men like John Clarke postulated, that there was a black point of view, a black aesthetic.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: And--but there those like Martin Kilson and others who were positioned in high places in big universities who say, oh, no, no, there's, there, there's no such thing.  And pe--people still say that.  I got Shelby Steele on there right now who says it's--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: I know, I know.
Speaker 1: Well, well, how would you answer those questions?
Speaker 2: There's an old Chinese proverb: "The world is full of illusions created for many purposes," okay.  And I don't condemn Shelby Steele or Martin Kilson for the views that they express.  If what they express helps them to understand what life is about, helps them to understand the fundamental questions, far be it from me to say that they're wrong, okay.  What I have to focus on, all right, is my own passion, okay, what gives me bliss, as Joseph Campbell says, and then I have to follow that, okay.  I have to speak my own truth, all right.  I'm not particularly interested in proselytizing to my point of view.  I'm not interested in convincing anyone that I'm right and they're wrong, okay.  I'm too busy attempting to figure out me, okay, what makes me go, what gets my juices up.
Speaker 1: Well, how would you define the, the black aesthetic?
Speaker 2: How would I define it?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: I wrote in a piece, an "American Behavioral Scientist" something to the effect that the black aesthetic--I didn't call it that exactly, but what I wrote was that this point of view that other people call Afrocentric, okay--some of my friends, maybe erstwhile friends after this--but it is a point of view that grows out of the historical experiences and folk wisdom of black people, okay.  Any point of view that is not grounded in life experience, okay, that--and I--is, is not--is suspect, okay, all right.  Now, I understand what I'm saying when I say that, because that means that the Europeans have a point of view that's grounded in their life experience as well, okay.  That's all fine and dandy, but hey, don't run around the planet ramming it down people's throat at the point of a gun, okay.  Let's learn a little respect here for a difference without converting difference into deviance, okay.  Let's be clear about that, all right.  So I go back to when I say grounded in life experience, what that does is it allows your point of view to evolve, to change as circumstances change, okay.  As new information becomes available, it develops, it grows, okay.  It's a living thing--should be a living a thing, as life experience is a living thing, capiche?
Story_ID: 55519
Speaker 1: Okay, I just wanna get that, you know, on record.  No, you know, 'cause you're, you're a professor.  You're a man of ideas.  And I know you --
Speaker 2: Yeah, right.
Speaker 1: You've, you've written extensively.  So, your first book was about the riots, of course, your, your dissertation.
Speaker 2: Well, actually--the first major piece of writing I probably did was my M.A. thesis that was on the student strike at San Francisco State College.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Okay, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, and was that, that the strike that led to the--
Speaker 2: Black Studies program in San Francisco State? Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: So, did--
Speaker 2: Then I did the--
Speaker 1: --go out there and do research or --
Speaker 2: No, no, no, nope, no money.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Starving student.
Speaker 1: I see, I see.
Speaker 2: Okay.  It was before research grants were readily available.
Speaker 1: What, what, what did you--can, can, can you sum up with you came up with in that work or?
Speaker 2: We don't mind you having something, but what we are willing to allow you to have is what we can live with, okay.
Speaker 1: And that's what they got basically?
Speaker 2: Right, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 55520
Speaker 1: But I know we haven't--you wrote going--recently, just this (unclear)--about 12 years ago you wrote a book called "Going to Meet a Man:--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --Denver's Last Legal Public Execution--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --27 July, 1886."
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And now, now, what was the--why did you--it's about the public ec--hanging of a man named Green.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Here in--
Speaker 2: Twenty thousand people at his execution, okay.  It was--it actually all began with a photograph that was given to me, or shown to me, by the director of Black Studies at the time that I, I came here or shortly after I came here.  And the caption on the back was "Last Man Publicly Hanged in Colorado," okay, something that I discovered was not true.  But it was an important event in that: one, it was Colorado's first experience with a degrees of murder law; it was the event whose circus character led to the abolition of public executions in the state, even though as I say, there were two more after it. It was important because Andrew Green, who had been to the eighth grade, raised some interesting kinds of questions in the eight-page autobiography he wrote in the "Rocky Mountain News."  It was printed in the "Rocky Mountain News."  And the character of the questions he raised went fundamentally to an issue that--to a term that I borrowed from Orlando Patterson.  In executing Green, what they did was to raise from social death to create a man they could physically put to death, okay.  And there are a whole lot of, of issues, legal issues, philosophical issues, political issues that you have to look at the book.  You know, you have to read the book to, to get at, because I've got a chapter in there--I believe it's Chapter Three.  It's funny 'cause I was talking about it with the soc. department's criminologist this morning.  And there's a chapter in there called, "How the Law Makes Crime," okay, because law is fundamentally the social expression of vested interested, okay.  And people behave in a way to protect, preserve, and defend their position and their privileges, okay.  So that their assessment of the present, their present will not become their past.
Story_ID: 55521
Speaker 1: All right, we're talking about your book on the last--well, what was called at one time "the last pubic execution in Colorado."  Andrew Green, a young black man--can you just kind of set up the circumstances of, of how he was incarcerated in the first place-what happened?
Speaker 2: It's he robbed a streetcar and he was carrying a pistol.  And as I write in the book, one of the things you have to understand about firearms is they have a way of altering the balance of power between people.  And they also have a way of giving you a false sense of security, okay.  And [Andrew] Green presented his pistol; told the driver to give him the cashbox; the driver screamed; and according to Green, the gun went off, because he'd already cocked it.  So, as this was Colorado's first experience with the degrees of murder law, and also the concept of felony murder, okay, that in essence said is that the crime you commit is less important than the life that you take, okay.  You are--it's, it's a kind of turning things around so that the judicial system alleges that you went there with the intent to kill the person, regardless of what the initiating behavior was, okay, all right.  You went there with the intention to kill.  And they said Green was guilty of felony murder.
Speaker 1: Is that--that's what felony mur--murder-
Speaker 2: That's what murder is: robbery, rape, arson--
Speaker 1: Armed robbery and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, it's sort of armed robbery.  But those are the index behavior.  That, that's the index behavior or examples of the index behavior.
Speaker 1: Is it--do they look at be--because the, the person premeditates that they're gonna have--they may have to use their gun?  Is that the reason why they, they, they say that the person intended to do it, even though they may not--
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: --have done it?
Speaker 2: --actually what it is--
Speaker 1: What?
Speaker 2: -is the initiating behavior is a crime against property.  And in a capitalist surpri--in a capitalist society, property is infinitely more important than life, okay, because the concept of felony murder has been in U.S. law since it was introduced in Pennsylvania in 1794, okay.  And it's a carryover from English common law that goes back to the 12th century, all right.  But is fundamentally--felony murder statutes are fundamentally a way of protecting property, okay, all right.  And it's, it's curious that we include rape in that because in some ways, in some respects, women are still viewed as property, okay.
Story_ID: 55522
Speaker 1: I was asking if--I mean people have died, you know, in felony--I mean in the murder part is, is real after the crime.  Though the criminal may not have been--placed the murder or the, the death of the victim as their top priority, they were op--they are prepared to dispatch the per--person if they have to, right?  I mean--
Speaker 2: Oh--
Speaker 1: --I mean that's what the law says, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's what the law assumes.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So, I don't know if you can say that it's just to protect property, but--on that level, 'cause somebody actually dies.
Speaker 2: Certainly--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --they die.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I mean I don't know what, what you--
Speaker 2: But what the law is arguing is that the person intended to kill the possessor of the property, okay, and that's what at issue.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right, you're, you're reversing the order so that you're saying that the intention is formed prior to the initiating act.  And what may actually be the case is that while the initiating act raises the probability that the possessor of the property may die, may be killed, okay, philosophers could argue that you are transposing some things that don't make sense in terms of explaining motivating characters in human behavior, okay.  Because you're saying that the behavior is an illustration of the motivation behind the behavior, and that may not be true.  That's all I'm saying, and, and that's all I say in the book.
Story_ID: 55523
Speaker 1: Okay.  And so, Green's incarcerated, and he's on I guess death row waiting to be hung.
Speaker 2: Well, he's not on death row.  They didn't have a death row in Arapahoe County Jail.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But what's interesting is that from the time Green was arrested on the 19th of May, he is allowed to remain alive only until the 27th of July.  So, in a little over two months he goes from committing the crime, being arrested for the crime, being incarcerated, having his case presented to the grand jury, going through the trial, being found guilty, being sentence to death, and then being incarcerated until the time that he is taken from the jail to the--to Cherry Creek, to a little hollow in the Cherry Creek, where he is put on a platform and a gallows has been constructed, okay, not the typical gallows that we see in the Western movies or in other places, the long drop method, as it's called.  But in this case, they have a new method called the twitch-up gallows.
Speaker 1: Now, what, what is that?
Speaker 2: And a falling weight pulls the body up, okay.  Supposedly, when the weight drops, it will take all of the slack out of the cord--out of the rope--and snap the neck of the miscreant.  In this instance, that did not happen, even though the headline of one of the papers read: "Green to be jerked to Jesus today," okay.  What happened was, the weight fell too slowly.  It got hung up in the pulleys, because they were insufficiently greased.  The rope--the weight was not sufficient to offset the weight of Green, the condemned man.  Green was slowly pulled up into the air, and it took him twenty-two and a half minutes to die.  He was strangled.
Speaker 1: Now, did people watch this?
Speaker 2: They cheered.  They sold lemonade.  It was a festive occasion.  As a matter of fact, I believe it was in the "Rocky Mountain News."  Maybe it was in--yeah, may--it was the--think it was in the "Rocky Mountain News."  It could have been the Denver--"Denver Tribune Republican" also.  But on the front page of the paper there was an after-the-hanging sale--the Golden Eagle department store.
Speaker 1: It's, it's hard to believe--(unclear)--
Speaker 2: Hey, truth is often stranger than, than fiction.
Speaker 1: Well, and--well, Colorado in those days was--(unclear) was no strange to lynchings and so forth.
Speaker 2: There were a number of those, but at the time we're talking about Colorado was very much interested in becoming the queen city of the plains.
Speaker 1: Denver you mean.
Speaker 2: I mean Denver, yeah.  And it was very much into boosterism.  And you can't have a spectacle like a public hanging and expect refined people from Boston, and New York, and Philadelphia with whom you compare yourselves, whose cities that had ended public executions twenty years earlier, thirty years earlier, fifty years earlier, okay--you can't expect them to invest money in your town, all right.  And there was that back and forth play between the "Rocky Mountain News" and the "Denver Tribune Republican," okay, in particular over the impact of the hanging and its import for business development in the city.
Speaker 1: So, you're saying that the, the penchant for the city's residents to find entertainment in an execution sort of was the signal that they weren't ready for other things.  But--
Speaker 2: Yeah, they weren't.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (Unclear)--they weren't ready.
Speaker 1: It was a clear signal that those--
Speaker 2: They weren't ready.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Okay, you know how black folks say, they wasn't ready?
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 2: Okay, they, they wasn't ready.
Story_ID: 55524
Speaker 1: Now, now, Mr. Green, Mr. Andrew Green, wrote some au--autobiographical material and, and--
Speaker 2: Eight-page.
Speaker 1: --raised, raised some issues you say.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: What did he, what did he--
Speaker 2: He, he did not claim that he was without sin.  I mean after all, he had spent five years in the Missouri State Prison.  He had spent six months in the Arapahoe County Jail.  He was, in some respects, a ne'er-do-well.  He'd shot his father because his father attempted to beat him, and put a bullet in his behind I believe.  And in some respects, he was a miscreant.
Speaker 1: A mean, mean fella--
Speaker 2: Not mean, but he was a miscreant.  But he was also a person who, in my view, was overcome by events.  I'm not saying that he was not responsible for the consequences of his actions.  He was, and he understood that, all right.  But one of the things that he did talk about was the forced confession, and how the detectives had plied him with liquor to get him to confess, and the promises that had been made to him to get him to confess.  So, there's some questions about that.  There were some other questions that he raised about the character of the punishment he was about to receive.  And there were several others that, you know--
Speaker 1: Yeah--(unclear)--
Speaker 2: --escape me at the moment.  Yeah, go buy the book.
Speaker 1: Go buy the book, yeah, right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Right, but the, but the point was he, he raised questions about the criminal justice system.
Speaker 2: Oh, absolutely, yeah--
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: --yeah.
Speaker 1: --they were valid questions.
Speaker 2: I believe they were valid, because they go to a fundamental issue.  And I even say it in the book that how can you realize procedural equity in the face of substantive equity when laws are made by people?  They are not exclusive of a cultural surround, okay.  And there are certain presumptions in the writing of the law.  After all, as I say, laws are social expression of vested interest.  There are certain presumptions there, in addition to which, one of those presumptions is that everyone is treated equally by the law; no one is above the law.  Well, history tells us otherwise. And as I've already commented about the difference between equal treatment and treatment as an equal, okay, if you say that the law treats everyone equally right away, you're dissing people who may not be perceived substantively in the same manner as you are, you see.  So there are some problems there, some real problems there that need to be addressed, that ought to be addressed, but frequently are not addressed because of things in the law, like stare decisis, okay.  When you establish a precedent, that sets the model for what succeeds until that precedent is overthrown.  So, we don't talk about the law as a construct of the consciousness within a specific milieu that has social factors, historical factors, political factors, economic factors attached to it.  Rather, we elevate the law up and out and treat it as if it is a thing in and of itself, and it is not.
Story_ID: 55525
Speaker 1: Okay, now, are you, are you working on a new book?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And what's your, your current project?
Speaker 2: I am working on a history of black Denver [Colorado]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --from 1858 to 2000.
Speaker 1: Now, many people probably who don't--are not from around here think of Denver in terms of skiing and, and cowboys, and the Rocky Mountains--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Hot lead and horse shit.
Speaker 1: Yes, and, and you know, we see Vail, [Colorado] Co--you say--you know, of a laid back, backpacking type, you know, celestial seasonings.  But what, what, what, what--is there--has there been a substantial black presence in Denver?
Speaker 2: There has been a black presence in Colorado since the 16th Century, beginning with the Spanish explorers.  There--you have the--you have in the early part of the 19th century--you have the fur traders, okay.  I mean even when Lewis and Clark came this way, they brought their faithful manservant, York, with them, okay.  And there have been others, okay, back with Rhodes (unclear).  And let's see.  What was it--in the 1860 census, I believe there were forty-six people of color-forty-six black folk--enumerated by the census in the territory of Colorado, okay.
Speaker 1: In the whole territory?
Speaker 2: In the whole territory, yeah.  And the territory then was the same size as the state is now.  And right now I think we're looking at about 3.8, maybe 3.9 percent of state population is black.  And there are about four million people in Colorado now, okay.  The bulk of the black folk live in Denver, Aurora; there's a fair number in Colorado--in Colorado Springs because of the military bases in that part and retired military folk; and there are a few other scattered here and there, okay.
Speaker 1: Have black pe--people played like a major role in, in the, the histor--the history of Denver [Colorado]?
Speaker 2: Yes and no.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Yes, in the sense that they had been a foil, a scapegoat for white folks.  No, in the sense that they've always--they've, they've been an invisible people as well--separated, segregated existence that lasted--well, let's see.  The "Keyes" decision [Keyes v. School District No.1]  that supposedly desegregated the public schools was handed down in '67 [1967] I think--no, '73 [1973]; it was handed down in '73 [1973].  And yet at the same time, the schools are still in many respects segregated.  Housing is not as desegregated, because if you've got the money you can pretty much live where you wanna live. But, yeah, black folk have, have been here.
Story_ID: 55526
Speaker 1: And, and, and why are you--I mean why, why this project and why are you--I mean what is gonna be different about your approach to this and--
Speaker 2: I'm just telling the story.  I mean that's what college professors do; they tell stories, and this is a story for me to tell, a story that really hasn't been told yet.  And even if other people do it, I've still got my own take on it, all right.
Speaker 1: And, and what, what, what is your particular take on it?  I mean can you summarize it, or?
Speaker 2: Not yet because I'm still feeling my way through the orientation.  I will have--I can tell you that it is not a chronological history, okay, as these things generally go.  But I, I believe that what I have to say about the black experience in Denver, Colorado, will be informative, okay, instructive, and I hope it will be as complete as I can make it.
Story_ID: 55527
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Let me--I know there, there are--I have with me like a--it's a, a vita, just filled with publications.  You've, you've written, you've written for, you know, I don't know how many journals and, and educational publications and scholarly publications.  And you really could--you, you really published a lot.  And you're a member of a number of org, organizations that support the study of African American life and history.  But you know, I just, I wanted to maybe, I wanted you to talk about, you know, what it's like being a professor here at the University of Colorado.  Can you get--I mean it's a place that's--I mean it's a beautiful campus, and--but I, you know, I don't know--we don't--I don't think one, one thinks of, you know, Black Studies at the University of Colorado necessarily when you--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: They don't think of Black Studies at the University of Mississippi at Oxford either.
Speaker 1: Yes, yeah.
Speaker 2: And it has a Black Studies program.
Speaker 1: Yes, sir.
Speaker 2: But like, but what has it been like for--(unclear)--and coming out of Cleveland [Ohio], you know, which has its--has a real big population of black folks in that part of Ohio than a lot of black communities.  How did you feel when you first came here to Colorado?
Speaker 1: Well, I came here because they offered me a job, all right, when some other folks didn't and just sort of, kind of stayed.  And I've been criticized for that on occasion for staying here when I could have got up and, and got about and maybe have brought fame and fortune to myself.  I don't know that I'm particularly interested in fame and fortune.  The fact that I've been here for thirty years probably makes that relatively clear.  I suppose I could say I rationalize being here by saying that somebody gotta civilize the heathen, okay; somebody gotta carry the message to the oppressor, and this place is better than a number of other places I've been, okay, in some ways.  In some other ways it's, you know, same old, same old.  It's about being on trial.  It's about having to perform.  It's about questions being raised, respecting the legitimacy of what you do, and whether there is indeed that much information out there for you to do something with.
Story_ID: 55528
Speaker 1: There are some--yeah, it's, it's, it's interesting.  I came here from a small school in Upstate New York where I had risen rather quickly to the top of the presidential fecal list and saw that, ah, big research university, okay, anonymity. I can research; I can read; I can write; I can teach.  I was here three weeks before I had a run-in with the president at a public meeting, okay.
Speaker 2: What was that about?
Speaker 1: The president at the time had made some inane statement at a meeting in Aspen [Colorado].  And the Black Staff Council, I believe it was at the time, wanted a meeting with him to have him explain himself, okay, and what he had been thinking when he made those statements.  So, I heard about the meeting, and I went to the meeting.  And after a while, I stood up and I raised my hand.  Daisy had taught me to be polite, okay, especially when you're about to raise a question with the village elders, okay.  You can, you can challenge the village elders, but you have to be polite when you challenge the village elders.  So I raised my hand, and I was recognized, and I asked my question.  It had something to do with the contradictions that were obviously apparent in his remarks.  From the back of the room: "Get him Dr. King, get him."
Speaker 2: Now these are the students.
Speaker 1: No, this was the--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --staff.
Speaker 2: The staff?
Speaker 1: This was the staff, the black staff.
Speaker 2: They had been--had they been waiting for a champion?
Speaker 1: I don't know.  I'm not anyone's champion.  I mean I'm doing good to find my way from bedroom to the bathroom in the morning.  I am nobody's leader, okay.
Speaker 2: So--
Speaker 1: I'm doing good to lead me.
Speaker 2: So they sort of set you on front street I guess.  Is that what you're saying?
Speaker 1: So much for anonymity.  And because this is a place where if you don't publish, you perish, I published, okay.  Maybe that's the reason that I'm still here after all these years.
Story_ID: 55529
Speaker 1: And you're saying it's hard to be anonymous on a campus like this if you're a black history pr--I mean a Black Studies professor anyway?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: It's you're, you're gonna be--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --scrutinized.
Speaker 2: I mean, when I arrived, I'm riding up the hill--up University Hill, and police car, university police car, pulls up and pulls me over.  They walk over to the car; they look in; they say, oh, excuse me--okay--turn around, go back in the car, and drive on.
Speaker 1: This--what is--
Speaker 2: They knew who I was.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah, one is forced and--I mean, kind of wonders if they stop you 'cause they can see you were black at a distance, and then they--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --couldn't find out who you were until they got--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --(unclear) just--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They knew who I was.  The university police knew who I was, okay.  And this may even have been before the confrontation that I had with the president.  I'm not sure.  I don't re--I don't remember, but I know that it took place.
Speaker 1: So have the--now, the black faculty and staff did they, did they try to get more leadership out of you after that incident with the--
Speaker 2: No, because I wasn't interested in being a leader.  I came here simply to scholar, okay.  If I am a leader, it is by default.  It is not anything that I have sought out.  As I said in the beginning, I'm really rather shy, okay.  And I ain't gonna put myself on front street.
Speaker 1: Now, what about the students?  Do the--have, have the students here seen you as a--have you, have you made attempt to be a mentor to, to the students here?  Most teachers do, but I, I guess I'm talking about the black students in par--particular.  Do they, do they see you as a--
Speaker 2: They have been told from day one to stay away from me, okay.
Speaker 1: And you, you know that that's--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I've been told that by them too.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Well, why, why?
Speaker 2: I'm gon' make 'em read.  I'm gon' make 'em write.  I'm gon' make 'em learn how to think.  I'm gon' make him challenge what they take for granted, okay.  I'm gon' make 'em question.
Story_ID: 55530
Speaker 1: We were discussing your interaction with students.  And you were explaining the ways you challenge the students, and, and may--in that that--the way you challenge them may lead to their avoidance of you actually as a teacher and a mentor.
Speaker 2: La--let's, let's be clear.  They are told to stay away from me, okay.
Speaker 1: They're told by?
Speaker 2: Their told by sometimes counselors, sometimes other students who have heard rumors and--I mean gonna front on you, okay.  You don't wanna--you know what I mean?  Okay, he gonna want you to be on your toes.
Speaker 1: Well, let me ask you this.  Have there been students that, that have benefitted--
Speaker 2: Oh yes.
Speaker 1: --from your instruction and, and--
Speaker 2: Oh yes.
Speaker 1: All right.  Could you tell us about some--
Speaker 2: It might be five years or more after they've been in class.  Sometimes they recognize that the conduct of the class is like no other class in which they've enrolled, all right, so that--I don't lecture, okay.  I tell stories.  I interrogate.  I ask people for their opinions, their feelings, their understandings.  I wanna know what's inside their heads, okay.  I hope that most of the time I'm being respectful, but I have no hesitation to suffer fools gladly, okay, in the sense of--excuse me.  I don't suffer fools gladly, okay.  I mean you have your opinions.  What evidence do you have to support it, okay.  How carefully have you examined what's coming out of your mouth.  Is your brain engaged before you put your mouth in gear.
Story_ID: 55531
Speaker 1: And that, that leads me to the title of one of the books you've written, and I think--if I'm--correct me if I'm wrong.  It seems to have been written to serve the needs of students, and it's called "How to Write Research Papers: A Guide for the Insecure."  Now--(unclear)--is that what you were thinking when you wrote that?
Speaker 2: Actually, the book came about because back in the late '70s [1970s], early '80s [1980s], I was shanghaied into a thing called the College Expository Writing Program where I was supposed to teach folk how to write.  I can't teach you how to do something in 15 weeks that you haven't ever learned how to do, okay.  It don't work that way.  So I figured that what I could do maybe was put together this little booklet that was--that actually started out as a couple of broadsides, okay--the couple of handouts that I would give on how to write research papers that were mostly a condensation of my experience in writing for publication.  And I added to it, and put some examples in it, and got the thing published.  And every now and again I still use it in a class, still make it available to students, okay.  It's more intended to help them develop an attitude, okay, a willingness to experiment.  'Cause I remember when I was having conversation one time with Lewis Gist at Virginia State University where I was working on a history of science in HBCUs' [Historically Black Colleges and Universities] project.  And I remember him telling me that so what if the HBCUs didn't have state the art equipment.  What we would do, he said, is we would give the students who pass through our labs an understanding of the basic principles such that when they encounter state-of-the-art equipment, they wouldn't feel foolish; they wouldn't feel overwhelmed; they would know what they had to do, okay.  We would do the best we could with what we had, but get them ready for the next level, okay.  And in some ways, that's, that's what I saw, this little book doing, helping people to get ready.  As I say, it was based on my experience as a writer and what I felt distilled down.  It's a very short book; it's only about eighty, ninety pages, something like that.  But it's distilled down to basically get across a couple of principles that can be used anywhere from the ninth grade to postdoc.
Story_ID: 55532
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did--do you see your role as a teacher to get students ready for the next level?  Is that--I mean, when--
Speaker 2: My--
Speaker 1: --you said that, I--it kind of connected, you know.
Speaker 2: My objective as a teacher is to help people, help my students in particular learn a thing or three about themselves and the worlds they inhabit, okay.  I tell folk at the beginning of the semester that what we're gonna do is cover maybe two or three ideas, okay.  And we'll do it over and over and over again, using numerous examples and illustrations and whatnot until such time as they feel comfortable playing with the ideas.  And in a very real sense, what they are also exposed to is how I think about the world, okay.  But I also make it clear that a student cannot remain with me for more than two years.  After two years they've learned all I have to teach.  It's time for them to go somewhere else.  I'm not interested in manufacturing disciples.  I'm not yet that insecure.
Speaker 1: Okay, do you have any disciples?
Speaker 2: Nope.  If I do, they're, they're not answering my emails.
Story_ID: 55533
Speaker 1: Now, tell me--now, now, you're teaching in what is now the ethnic studies department at the University of Colorado in Boulder, that whole--what is the ethnic studies department?  And, and, and just briefly how do you--how, how, how does what you do fit into this?
Speaker 2: The latest--the, the Department of Ethnic Studies in the University of Colorado at Boulder is the latest iteration of what began in 1968 as the black studies program, was followed by the Chicano studies program, was then in 1987 combined with interest groups in American, Indian, and Asian American studies to form the Center or Studies of Ethnicity and Race in America that in January of 1996 became the Department of Ethnic Studies.  I came here in black studies, and that is essentially where I have remained even though I do teach some of the basic courses in ethnic studies, research methods, senior seminar, Intro to Ethnic Studies, those kinds of things.  But mostly I focus on, and I coordinate, the program or the track, if you would, in what we now call Afro-American studies--one word.
Story_ID: 55534
Speaker 1: There's two more questions.  This one you, you know, you, you seem so humble about this.  But what do you think your legacy will be?
Speaker 2: I have absolutely no idea, absolutely none.  I'd like to be remembered as a good storyteller, okay.  Yeah, I'd like to be remembered as a good storyteller, someone who got you to think about a thing or three, okay.
Story_ID: 55535
Speaker 1: Now, in terms of your family, I know you have--I know you have a son.  Do you have--did you--were you--
Speaker 2: I have two.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay, two sons--
Speaker 2: Yeah, mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: Now, did you met your--their--now, were, were you married when you came here to the university?
Speaker 2: I was married when I came here, but that ended in divorce.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that is where son number one came.  Son number two came with a woman that I met and married here.  After we were married for six years, she was killed in an auto accident.  And even though I remarried for a brief time, I essentially raised number two son by myself, okay.  He's adopted as well, all right.  We adopted him after Wynette (ph.) found out that she couldn't have children.  And as I say, the third marriage didn't last long, two and a half years maybe--two and three quarters years, something like that, and then that ended.  And then there is the current Mrs. King.  We have known each other for twenty years-twenty-two years.  Mrs. King was actually one of my Ph.D. students here at the university.  And she left--she graduated in 1980.  She left, she left Denver [Colorado] in 1984.  She went to Southern [University] to help open a nursing school.  She went to Washington to work on the Hill at the American Nursing Association.  Nineteen ninety-two [1992] she phoned me, as she says, to brag to her old professor about what she had accomplished.  For five years we talked about this, that, and the other thing, well, occasionally, okay.  And we talked about the relationships in which we were involved.  We talked about a number of things.  The woman I was seeing at the time subsequently died of, of brain cancer.  And in 1997 Carla phoned just to find out what was going on in my life because we hadn't talked in a while.  And she figured that Lois (and I had gotten married.  And that's when I pointed out to her that Lois had died several months earlier.  And she said, ah-ha, he's eligible and he's available (laughter).  Need I say more?  So in June of '99 [1999] we got married, and it's okay.  She works out of the house as a health services researcher.  And I come up here two or three times a week to tell stories and occupy space.

Speaker 1: How do you, how do you feel that right--this position is--has this position been good, good for you, you know?
Speaker 2: Some days.  Other days, no way, okay. It's funny.  I was talking with a colleague this morning, an older white colleague that I happened to, to meet outside the Student Union where I was going to go grab a bite.  And he was talking about how he was getting ready to retire because he was tired of all the bullshit; he was tired of corruption; he was tired of faculty meetings; he was tired of teaching regularly and said, "I'm seventy two years old.  I'm tired of this."  He said, "I've been teaching for forty years."  I said, hey, man, I've been teaching for thirty six.  And he said--he brought back the corruption thing again.  And I just looked at him and I said, "What institution in the United States is not corrupt?  Tell me one that is not."  And he just kind of paused for a minute, said, "You know, you've got a point there." And we went our separate ways.
Speaker 1: So you gotta engage this, right, your saying?  You have--
Speaker 2: Yeah, you gotta engage it.  You can't--first of all, you can't take yourself seriously, okay.  One of the things that I learned from Wynette was that life is too important to be taken seriously, okay, much, much too important.  And also, at the same time, you have to take the work that you do seriously, okay, not only because it feeds you, but also because it provides you a sense of purpose, yeah.
Speaker 1: Do you think that your parents could have imagined that you would be doing this at this stage in life?  Did they, they--did they get a chance to see you, you know, em--employed in a, in a university before they--
Speaker 2: My father did.  My mother did not.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My father died in '72 [1972], so he had seen me teach at the small--he, he knew that I taught at a small liberal arts college in New York, yeah.  But no, my mother did not.  But, as I've said time and time again, too, in a number of places, for them the big event was me graduating from high school.  Because after that, everything else--
Speaker 1: Exceeded the--
Speaker 2: --was a fait accompli.  It was a question of time more than it was a question of whether I was going to get it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 55537
Speaker 1: All right, and one last question.  This is the last one and--
Speaker 2: Sure it is.
Speaker 1: What do you, what do you think the value of oral history is?  And we're, we're engaged in this oral history project, and you know, I know you're a biographer and--(unclear)--what do you think the value of this is for, for people who'll see this in the future?
Speaker 2: It is a way of acquiring information in a manner that pays respect to the creator of the information and to the surround within which that information is created, okay.  All too often, in history in particular, we praise the sanctity of written documents.  Yes, we subject them to external and internal criticism, but we have to intuit tone, and texture, and pitch, and loudness, okay, and shadings of meaning, okay.  But when we do oral history, we learn to listen.  We listen not only to the informant, but we also learn to listen to ourselves.  We be quiet; we stay quiet, and at the same time we hear when we permit ourselves to what we are telling ourselves as we respond in our own way to the information that is coming to us, okay.  But that's what I do during the day.  At night I teach karate.
Speaker 1: That's right, you are a karate--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Right, are you a--you a black belt, right?
Speaker 2: Third degree.
Speaker 1: Third degree, all right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: That's right--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: That's--(unclear)--that's--
Speaker 2: So that's what I do during the day, and then that's what I do at night.  As I said, it keeps me off the street.  And one of my students--one of my smart aleck--he says: "We're glad you're off the street at night."  (Laughter).
Speaker 1: Well, thank you, Dr. King.
Speaker 2: No problem.

Speaker 1: What are your hope, hopes and concerns for the black community?
Speaker 2: I have--I don't know.  Perhaps--maybe most important is to get people to understand, black folk, and white folk, peasant and power broker, that black folks are Americans just like they are.  We eat the same food.  We see the same movies.  We embrace the same values, okay.  We abide by some of the same background and domain assumptions as anyone else who calls himself/herself a citizen of the realm.  So yeah, I'd like, like that, okay.  I'd like also for the joy, the beauty, the spirit, the full range of feelings that illuminate the black community to be accepted as they are without translation, without transliteration.  That would be nice too.  I don't know where I stand on the issues of reparations.  My oldest son and I have had a numer--number--of conv--conversations about this.  I don't believe that there is the will in America to return to black people their investment in this society, okay.  I don't believe that.  I believe that if you want to talk about money, it is hopelessly inadequate.  There is not there much money in the Universe to adequately compensate black people for the 200 and almost fifty years they spent in slavery and the 170 years, approximately, discrimination, segregation, prejudice, murders, lynchings, rapes, exploitations, the whole nine yards, okay.  Ain't that much money in the Universe.  And for me it's not about money, okay.  Sure, I can use a couple of dollars more than I got now, all right.  But we are talking about a people here, okay.  As [W.E.B.] Du Bois said, "We are talking about a nation within a nation that at the same time cannot divorce itself from the larger society," okay.  So yeah, we need to think about that one, okay.
Speaker 1: Do you think that America actually owes black pe--pe--people anything?
Speaker 2: Oh, hell yes, absolutely, okay.  But I don't know how to calculate what they owe, okay.  And it is an owing in the sense of thwarted opportunities, in the sense of oppression, okay, suppression in the denial of respect, okay, yeah, all of those things and more.  But yeah, the country owes us.
Story_ID: 55539
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, is there anything that you would like to say that I haven't asked?
Speaker 2: You mean add to (unclear)?
Speaker 1: I don't know--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Ah, I don't know.  It's been interesting.  It's got me to think about some things that I haven't really chewed on in years.  I hope that what I've said is of use to someone; but then, I say that about all of the things I produce.  Yeah, I hope it's of, of, of use to someone, hope they get something out of it.  I'm not sure what, but--and I, and I, I don't feel as though what I'm exhibiting here is hubris, a false pride, false humility, what have you.  This is the way I am, okay.  I've had my share of leadership positions.  I've been on the public platform.  I've been feted. I've been acknowledged, but a lot of that stuff makes me very, very uncomfortable, okay.  I'm much happier being in the back room, okay.  I'm really not that much of a public person, even though that's the way I earn my living, okay, professing.  And if that ain't public, I don't know what is, okay.  But yeah, I expect that's about it.  I don't know.
Speaker 1: Well--
Speaker 2: Nothing else really occurs to me.
Speaker 1: Well, in this room surrounded by books, I thank you, Dr. King.
