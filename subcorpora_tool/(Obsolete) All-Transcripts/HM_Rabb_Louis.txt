Speaker 2: We have, there were six boys in our family, no girls, and my father [Allen Louis Rabb] gave each one a nickname, and my nickname was Mike and everybody knows me as Mike Rabb, but I went from Columbus, Mississippi to Tuskegee [Alabama].  The reason why I went was because in Mississippi, in 1920s, in that area, the city, the school system didn't provide services for blacks beyond the tenth grade.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, I want to get to that in a minute--
Speaker 2: All right, okay.

Speaker 1: Before we go into depth, there are five lightweight questions that we always ask (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) All right, all right.
Speaker 1: --and they make me ask them of everybody, and they only require a short answer.  The first one is, do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Color?
Speaker 1: Yes sir.
Speaker 2: No, not particularly.
Speaker 1: Okay, a favorite food?
Speaker 2: Steak, if I had to choose one thing.
Speaker 1: Okay, a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Some place where I can play golf--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --but I've been a number of places and I play golf everywhere I go.
Speaker 1: Okay, a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Summer, spring and summer.
Speaker 1: Okay, and the last one is, do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: I can't recall anything.  If I had thought you were going to ask the question, I would have started thinking about, no, no, I don't think I do.
Story_ID: 402760
Speaker 1: Now I'm going to ask you about your family history.
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: I'm going to ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's [Allen Louis Rabb] side.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: First we'll start with your mother's side.  Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Emma, E-M-M-A, last name was Farnandis, F-A-R-N-A-N-D-I-S, Farnandis [Emma Farnandis Rabb].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That was her maiden name.
Speaker 1: Um-hm, that's an unusual spelling--
Speaker 2: I know it is, but that's the way it is.
Speaker 1: Yes sir.  What nationality is that name from?  Do you have any story about the name?  Where it came from or anything?
Speaker 2: No, it wasn't, just black, you know, Negro was just all.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's kind of a Spanish name, right?
Speaker 2: I know it sounds like it was a person came from down in the Louisiana area, that's the way it sounds but I don't know if my father's, I mean my mother's parents [Grace Farnandis and Benjamin Farnandis, Jr.] were from down there or not, but she was living in Columbus, Mississippi when she married my father.
Speaker 1: Okay, now do you, can you give us your mother's date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: No I can't.  I can only tell you she died when she was forty-three, I think it was.
Speaker 1: Okay, and about what year was that?
Speaker 2: I couldn't tell you.  I was such a little fellow.
Speaker 1: Oh, you were still a child when she died?
Speaker 2: Oh, good Lord.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Story_ID: 402761
Speaker 1: You said you had the record of your parents' [Emma Farnandis Rabb and Allen Louis Rabb]--
Speaker 2: Oh, I have the invitation that was sent out.  A copy of it (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) This is in the 1890s?
Speaker 2: Eighteen ninety-something [1890s], in the early 1890s I would say.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: But I don't recall exactly.
Speaker 1: Now do you have any information about your mother's side of the family at all?  Do you know, are there any stories about them or anybody in the family that you remember that, do you remember your grandparents [Grace Farnandis and Benjamin Farnandis, Jr.] or--
Speaker 2: No.  My grandfather, so I'm told, bought his freeman, bought his freedom, and Christopher [Christopher Rabb] could tell you more about it than I can because he is a genealogist and he's gone back and done a study of my family and--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --so from Christopher, my grandfather was called Mad Jack Rabb, that's what they called him.
Speaker 1: Mad Jack--
Speaker 2: Now why that name, I don't know, but Christopher has done a complete thing on my family and he can give you some detail.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, Mad Jack Rabb's on the Rabb's side, right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The Rabb side, right.  Mad, but--
Speaker 1: Okay, but on your mother's side, that's--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: You don't know?
Speaker 2: It was Benjamin Farnandis, that's all I know.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, okay.  So Benjamin--
Speaker 2: Farnandis, F-A-R-N-A-N-D-I-S.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now did your mother talk about growing up and going to school (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I was so small, I don't remember my mother saying anything to me.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay, yeah, that's right, okay.  What memories do you have of her at all?  I mean--
Speaker 2: Well, she was crippled.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And my brother, Maurice [Maurice F. Rabb, Sr.], who was a doctor, I used to ask him, "Why was my mother," he said, "Mike [HistoryMaker Louis Rabb], I'm not sure," and we wondered whether or not, for example, it may have been polio.  I have never, I never saw my mother stand up.  She was always sitting, and she could not stand up, or during my lifetime.
Speaker 1: Okay, any other stories about her or memories?
Speaker 2: No, I can't recall, I was so young and I don't remember anything about her.
Speaker 1: What did she look like, was she--
Speaker 2: I have pictures of her, but I just can't tell you, but I guess she looked like a Rabb.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I just can't tell you but--
Speaker 1: Did she ever--
Speaker 2: --I have pictures.
Speaker 1: Okay, does she have the freckles and--
Speaker 2: I'm not sure about that.  The picture may not have shown the freckles, they may have them, but I have a picture of my mother and my father--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --when they were married.
Story_ID: 402762
Speaker 1: Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Allen, A-L-L-E-N, his middle name is Louis, just like my first name, L-O-U-I-S, Allen Louis Rabb.
Speaker 1: And what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Say that again?
Speaker 1: What is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: I have all that information but I don't recall it.
Speaker 1: Okay, but, okay, you say he was born in the 1880s, 1870s?
Speaker 2: He died in 1932, I think.  He was sixty-five years old.
Speaker 1: Okay, and where was he born?
Speaker 2: I don't know that but I would imagine right there in Columbus [Mississippi].
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, so probably Columbus.
Speaker 2: But Christopher [Christopher Rabb] has all of that.  He can give you detail.
Speaker 1: Yes sir, but, you know, we ask because you might know something--
Speaker 2: I don't.
Speaker 1: --that he doesn't even know about, you know--
Speaker 2: I don't.
Speaker 1: --'cause sometimes, you know, since you were there--
Speaker 2: I understand that, right.
Speaker 1: --so, now, what do you know about your father's family?  I mean, how much do you know about the Rabb side?
Speaker 2: Not a great deal.  He had brothers, I know that and all of this, Christopher has the complete, and in detail, has all of that, but I just don't know about it.
Speaker 1: So his father was Mad Jack Rabb, right?  Allen Louis Rabb's father was Mad Jack?
Speaker 2: My mother's father, yeah, my mother's father.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay, your mother's father--
Speaker 2: No, no, wait a minute, now.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: No, my father's father--
Speaker 1: Yeah, yes sir, okay, all right.
Speaker 2: --yeah, in other words it would have been my grandfather, and--
Speaker 1: Right, right.  Okay, and you don't have any idea why they called him Mad Jack, right?
Speaker 2: I would imagine that he may have been an individual who didn't conform to the way in which the whites expected blacks to relate to them.
Speaker 1: Okay, so he would have been like what they call a crazy Negro or somebody that--
Speaker 2: That's right, right.  That's my guess.
Speaker 1: Okay, and they would be expecting him to be--
Speaker 2: To get the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) subservient and--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, right because, yeah--
Speaker 1: --take low and that sort of thing.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and there's a, I say, Christopher told me he bought his freedom and all that sort of thing.
Speaker 1: Okay, so he bought his freedom--
Speaker 2: But I--
Speaker 1: --during slavery and had--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, he was a slave, of course.  He bought his freedom.
Speaker 1: Okay, are there any stories in the family about the Civil War--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --or the transition--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --from slavery to freedom?
Speaker 2: No, nothing about that at all.  I know nothing.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Did your father tell stories of growing up?
Speaker 2: Did my father do what?
Speaker 1: Tell stories of growing up in Columbus.
Speaker 2: No, I was always amazed that the relationship, and Maurice [HistoryMaker Dr. Maurice F. Rabb] here, and the one that you know, and there's the whole family, how friendly they are and how they were all so affectionate, hugging one another and all that, I never hugged my brother or my father hugged me in all my life.  We were never like that.
Speaker 1: Was that typical of the way (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Typical of all of our family.
Speaker 1: Okay, and did most people behave that way when you were coming up?
Speaker 2: No, they did not.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's why I'm so surprised at it.  It's just an experience for me.  I remember the first time I saw Maurice, the one that just left here, he came up to hug me and I'm shaking his hand and Madeline [HistoryMaker Madeline Murphy Rabb] says, "Mike [HistoryMaker Louis Rabb], we are, we are huggers."  You're--but I never, I'm not a person accustomed to that.  I never hugged one of my brothers in my life and neither one of them doesn't--neither one has done it to each other.  We just, we're not affectionate like that.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: That wasn't a part of us.
Speaker 1: Okay, so did your father go to school in Tuskegee [Alabama] or Columbus rather (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, God no.
Speaker 1: --Columbus, Mississippi?
Speaker 2: He may have but I don't know.  He had a business and I had to work in it, all the boys had to work in it.
Speaker 1: Now what kind of business did he have?
Speaker 2: A market, he ran, he sold only meats and fish products, seafood things.
Speaker 1: What was the--
Speaker 2: We didn't sell groceries.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was a meat market.  He butchered his own meat.  He, and he bought his cows and hogs and sheep and all that sort of thing.  Had, we had a slaughterhouse and I worked as a kid, growing up in that environment.
Speaker 1: So, what was the name of his business?  What did he call it?
Speaker 2: Rabb's Market.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No, Rabb's Meat Market [Columbus, Mississippi], that's what it--that was the complete title of the place.
Speaker 1: Okay, now--
Speaker 2: I have a lot of pictures of that too, also.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, so you all had a business going on in Columbus and--
Speaker 2: My father did.
Speaker 1: Your father did.
Speaker 2: Had a business, right.
Story_ID: 402763
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) How many brothers and sisters do you have?
Speaker 2: I had no sisters, they were all boys (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) No, just brothers, okay.
Speaker 2: Six boys.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So did you grow up in Columbus [Mississippi]?
Speaker 2: I did until I was about thirteen.  I went to Tuskegee [Alabama], had my fourteenth birthday at Tuskegee.
Speaker 1: Okay, but before we get to Tuskegee, can you tell us something about Columbus, Mississippi?  What were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Typical relationship between whites and blacks, that's all I can tell you.
Speaker 1: Well tell us 'cause some people, kids are going to be watching this in the future and they don't know what that is, and they're going to think that it's one way when it might be another.  So, tell us what those relations were in those days.
Speaker 2: Well, it's the same type of things, that blacks have had to grow up and experience until just recently, you know, until they passed all the laws and where you could do and what you couldn't do and those days you just had your place and you lived in it, as a black person.
Speaker 1: For instance, give me an example.
Speaker 2: Well, you know, you couldn't go to theaters, you had to sit upstairs.  You couldn't go to anything but a black school and it didn't provide educational training for anybody beyond the tenth grade, as I told you.  That's as high as you could go in the high school.
Speaker 1: Did you go to, was it an all-black school?
Speaker 2: Oh, oh sure.  Everything was all black.  You're all black or all white.  There was nothing that was integrated in those days.
Speaker 1: Okay, were they--
Speaker 2: I left Tuskegee, I mean, I left Columbus in 1927 and went to Tuskegee.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, so you lived--
Speaker 2: I had my fourteenth birthday at Tuskegee.
Speaker 1: Was it, so in Columbus, there's a black side of town, I guess, right?
Speaker 2: Oh, sure.  Well, yes (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Did it have a special name?
Speaker 2: It just happened that where we were living, where my father [Allen Louis Rabb] was living, was only, right on the borderline of where blacks and whites, 'cause my next, my next door neighbor was white in Columbus.
Speaker 1: Did the black side of town have a special name that they called it?
Speaker 2: As a matter of fact, I was told that my father and mother [Emma Farnandis Rabb] lived almost a block or two from the center of the town at one time but, so, I can't tell you anything about how, what life was like during that period because I was born about six blocks from the center of town, center of town, five or six blocks, short blocks.  So I don't know much about it.  I just left Columbus so early.
Speaker 1: Okay, did, are there any stories about Columbus, about race relations in Columbus that you could tell us?
Speaker 2: They were typical, black and white, when I was growing up.
Speaker 1: Are there any stories about somebody getting in trouble down there, for anything?
Speaker 2: No, not in my family--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --because my father was highly respected as a black person by the white people.
Speaker 1: Are any stories of the, did you know about the Ku Klux Klan [KKK] and that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: No, nothing about them.  I learned all that in later years.
Speaker 1: Okay, so it wasn't a big deal in Columbus at--
Speaker 2: It may have been but I said, I didn't experience it and didn't know about it.
Story_ID: 402764
Speaker 1: Did you go to church in Columbus [Mississippi]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: What church were you all part of?
Speaker 2: A Baptist church.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I, me.
Speaker 1: Yeah, what was the name of it?  Do you remember?
Speaker 2: I'm trying to remember, I'm trying to remember.  I don't remember right now.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Was it a big deal to go to church then?  Was it something--
Speaker 2: No, we've been normally.  It's just like we're, all people go to church.
Speaker 1: Okay, so--
Speaker 2: Now, it's interesting though, I never saw my father [Allen Louis Rabb] ever go to church.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I know my mother [Emma Farnandis Rabb], I told you my mother was crippled--
Speaker 1: Um-hm, so they--
Speaker 2: --but as a kid--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Huh?  I had no uncle.  My father, period.
Speaker 1: So you're, the kids went to church, you and your brothers went to church then?
Speaker 2: Oh, we didn't go together.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I went to church, I remember that and I never remember my little, I was, I told you I was next to the last, I was next to the youngest and, of the six boys.
Speaker 1: Okay, now how did you like school when you were growing up?  Did you like it?
Speaker 2: I did not like going to school.  I always liked to tell everybody that I was forced to go to Tuskegee [Tuskegee Normal and Industrial Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama].  My brother [Maurice F. Rabb, Sr.], Maurice's grandfather [sic.], was a scholar, he went to Fisk [Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee] and graduated top of his class and everything and went into medicine at Meharry [Meharry Medical College, Nashville, Tennessee], but he was a top student all while he was in, during his educational career.  So, he wanted me to be like he was and I wasn't interested in going to school.  I was forced to go to Tuskegee so I had to go.
Speaker 1: Well, what was your personality like when you were growing up?  What were you like and what did you like to do?
Speaker 2: The thing that all kids like to do, that's all I can tell you and nothing unusual, but I know I didn't want to go to school but I did go and I graduated from the second year, high school, that they had there, in Columbus.  So, but in order to graduate from high school, I had to go away from Tuskegee--from Columbus.
Speaker 1: Okay, do you think, just one more thing about that, do you think you took more after your mother or your father?
Speaker 2: I can't think I took after either one of them.  I, because I don't remember that place and how it is to know whether or not mine was similar to theirs.  I, there's nothing unusual that I can recall.
Speaker 1: Well, did you have a pretty happy personality growing up or were you, you know--
Speaker 2: I had to do what my father wanted me to do, and what he told me to do and my mother couldn't do anything.  Her sisters took care of my younger brother [Alvin Rabb] and me as I was growing up, until I got to be the age of, we were talking about, until I was thirteen.
Speaker 1: Now, when you were thirteen and they, well, did you have a favorite subject in school?  Anything?
Speaker 2: No, can't remember anything in particular I liked.  I just didn't want to go to school.  I went and when I went to Tuskegee, my brother, who was eleven years older than I, went to medicine, Meharry, and all that sort of thing.  He pushed me to go to school and made my father, not made, he encouraged my father to send me to Tuskegee to finish high school and, of course, he kept after me all the while I was in Tuskegee to remain there.  I wanted to go back home.  I didn't want to go to school.
Story_ID: 402765
Speaker 1: How far away was Tuskegee [Tuskegee Normal and Industrial Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama] from Columbus, Mississippi?
Speaker 2: About two, three, about 250, 300 miles.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's pretty far.  So--
Speaker 2: And I had never been anywhere out of Columbus before I went to Tuskegee.
Speaker 1: Okay, now did you know much about it before you went?  Had you heard about Booker T. Washington or (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Nothing, no.  I just went over there because I was, that was chosen for me.  I didn't chose it.
Speaker 1: Okay, so this is 1927, right?
Speaker 2: Nineteen twenty-seven [1927], right.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: September, 1927.  I had my fourteenth birthday at Tuskegee.  I was very small.  I always liked to tell people, when I went there I was 4'11" high and I weighed seventy-three pounds.  That's, that was my size and I was in the little boys' dormitory at Tuskegee and I will always remember the matron of the building, a woman.  When I walked outside one day, she was out there in the yard and she looked at me, put her hands on her hip and she says, "Boy, they picked you green, they picked you green."  I was too small, but that was the comment she made.  She couldn't believe that anybody that small was coming to Tuskegee--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --but that's the way I was when I went there.
Speaker 1: Well, what, who were some of the friends you made at Tuskegee when you got there?
Speaker 2: I didn't have any friends but that just happened that there were two fellows who came from Tuskegee who were on the football team.  They knew my family but they were older.  The captain of the football team learned that I was in Tuskegee, had been, had admitted and he had me transferred from the room that they had assigned to me to his room to room with him.  So I was rooming with the captain of the football team.  I didn't know him but he knew my family, apparently.
Speaker 1: Okay, had any of your other brothers gone to Tuskegee?
Speaker 2: No, no, no.
Speaker 1: You were the first one?
Speaker 2: First one, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, was the captain of the football team from Columbus?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was from Columbus.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He knew my family and maybe he knew my father [Allen Louis Rabb] and it was, he expected me, I don't know, I just don't know but he did have me transfer from one part of the building to his room to room with him, just the two of us, but he was captain of the football team.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And in those days, Tuskegee had an unusually famous football team.  They would go years without losing a game.
Story_ID: 402766
Speaker 1: There's a story about meeting George Washington Carver.  Did you meet him when you were--
Speaker 2: Yeah, but that was, well that was accidental.  I was walking along the campus [of Tuskegee Normal and Industrial Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama] one day and an elderly gentleman, shabbily dressed, that's the way Dr. Carver was, stopped me and, I don't know why he just picked me to stop, he said, "Young man, do you know what kind of tree this is?"  I looked up at the tree and looked at him, I said, no, walked away.  And one of the students says, man, that was Dr. Carver spoke to you, hell I never heard of Dr. Carver, didn't know who the hell he was but anyway, that was my first experience with him.  And, but he mildly reprimanded me for not knowing that that was an oak tree.  All trees are alike to me, look alike to me.  He said, "When I was growing up, we had chinaberry trees, we used to climb up in, play with," but I didn't know anything about trees but I don't know why he stopped me but he did.  That was my first experience with Dr. Carver and, inasmuch as he was on the agriculture side, and I was up on the other part of the campus, I never had any direct close contact with him until I graduated from college because I used to hear him speak in chapel as all students did, and he had an unusually high-pitched voice.  Everybody would remember that but he was a, of course everybody knows about George Washington Carver.  He was quite a scientist, graduated from Iowa State [Iowa Agricultural College and Model Farm; Iowa State University, Ames, Iowa] but he came to Tuskegee with Booker Washington [Booker T. Washington], and he was there when I went to Tuskegee and he didn't die until around 1940, something like that, but I didn't have any contact with him because I was not in the agriculture field.  When I graduated from high school, I went right on into college.  The college, that was new at that time.  When I went there, and this is something that's amazing to the professors now, at this renowned university, didn't know that in 1927 that 97 percent, I would guess, I think about 95 to 100 percent of the students were just high school.  It was no college.  The college just started about two or three years earlier.
Speaker 1: Did they call it--
Speaker 2: But by the time I finished high school, I went right on into college.  Do you understand me?
Speaker 1: Yes, sir.  They called it the Tuskegee Institute, right?
Speaker 2: It was Tuskegee Institute, that's all it said, but it was a high school, and they came from all, from out of the country and students coming from everywhere but they were coming there to go to high school until the college started, of course.
Speaker 1: Now, when did Tuskegee start?  Did, can you tell us when did it--
Speaker 2: The college?
Speaker 1: Yes, sir.  Well, the institute first of all.
Speaker 2: Eighteen eighty-one [1881].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's when it was founded by Booker Washington, who came down from Hampton [Hampton Normal and Agricultural Institute; Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia], in Virginia.  He was sent there to, but he was the founder, Booker T. Washington.
Story_ID: 402767
Speaker 1: Yeah, before we move on with Tuskegee [Tuskegee Normal and Industrial Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama], let's go back a little bit.  I, there's a story about you shoveling coal, I think, or something that you--
Speaker 2: No, that was in Tuskegee.
Speaker 1: In Tuskegee, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Well, you want me to talk about that now?
Speaker 1: Sure, yeah.
Speaker 2: Well, at Tuskegee, most of the students had to work, and in my case, I had to have three jobs in order to pay my expenses and working.  The power plant at Tuskegee used coal in order to, for the fuel, for the campus with the power plant, and trainloads of coal would be brought in and I was, part of my work experience was unloading coal.  I had three jobs at one time.  I worked in an office as a clerk during my college career, and unloaded coal later in the afternoon, and washed dishes in the cafeteria after I finished doing the coal.  I had three jobs at one time in order to earn my expenses while I was in school.  That was a part of my college life.

Speaker 1: Who was the president when you were at Tuskegee [Tuskegee Normal and Industrial Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama]?
Speaker 2: Dr. Robert Russa Moton, he was the second, he succeeded Booker Washington [Booker T. Washington], who was the founder, and who died in 1915.  Dr. Moton became the second president to, and he was president of the univer- of the school, of Tuskegee Institute until 1935.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: In other words, my whole college career was under the second president of Tuskegee, Dr. Robert Russa Moton.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, are there any other professors, well who were some of your favorite teachers and who were some of the outstanding professors there when you were at Tuskegee?  We've already talked (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I didn't have any favorites--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --because I told you that I was almost being forced to stay in school, but I did stay in school, and I did graduate.
Speaker 1: But once you got there, you didn't like it?  I mean, you still didn't like it?
Speaker 2: Oh, no, I never, I didn't want, I didn't like the, I didn't like to be anywhere but I didn't want to particularly go to school but I told you, my brother [Maurice F. Rabb, Sr.], and I'm also grateful for everything that he has done for me, that he made me stay in school.  So I graduated from Tuskegee in 1935.
Speaker 1: Now, okay.  Now, first you graduated from high school, right?
Speaker 2: From high school, went right on into college.
Speaker 1: Yeah, high school graduation was what year?
Speaker 2: Thirty-one [1931].
Speaker 1: Thirty--okay.  In college--
Speaker 2: I went right on into college from high school at Tuskegee 'cause the college was a going program at that time.
Speaker 1: Now, there's a personality, I'm going to ask you about him.  You may or may not know much about him but, the photographer, P.H. Polk was there, wasn't he?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I knew him quite well.
Speaker 1: Did you, okay.  What was he like and do you have any stories about him?
Speaker 2: Well, he was a nice, he was a very nice person.  He was at Tuske- he was Tuskegee's photographer, official photographer, and he just made pictures, everything, at any activity when one of Tuskegee, he was the, he did, well he taught photography.  Tuskegee was a trade school at that time, but he taught photography to all of the students who enrolled in that field.  For example, when I went there, I was enrolled in the tailor, in the tailoring shop.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I had four years, I have a whole high school of training as a tailor but when I graduated from high school, I went into business administration in the college.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's one reason why I didn't have much contact with Dr. Carver [George Washington Carver] during those years.  It wasn't until after I graduated, when the new president, Dr. Patterson [Frederick D. Patterson], who was the third president of Tuskegee, he became president, succeeding Dr. Moton in June, on June 1st, 1935.  I graduated at the end of May 1935.  So I was one of the first persons that he employed.  He gave me a job, and he assigned me over to the dining hall.

Speaker 1: What was your social life like at Tuskegee [Tuskegee Normal and Industrial Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama]?  I mean, did the, I mean how did it compare to college life today?  Did the males and females--
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: --intermingle or what?
Speaker 2: During classes and things like that, yes, it would, you mingle, but when you went, for example, to chapel, the boys sat on one side, the girls on another.  When you went to a movie, it's the same way, you could not sit together.
Speaker 1: You couldn't sit next to your date at the--
Speaker 2: No, no, you could not, yeah.  Well that's the way you had to live.  The boys didn't go in the section of where the girls dormitories were and the girls couldn't go in the area where the boys dormitories was completely--
Speaker 1: So, no visiting?
Speaker 2: No, no, of course none.
Speaker 1: Well what happened if you were, I mean, where would you, well, we all know that boys are interested in girls and vice versa so, where would they meet?
Speaker 2: Where would they meet?  In the cafeteria, in the dining hall, they sat, they sat together in the dining hall, at football games, things of that sort but other than that, it was completely separate, the boys and the girls.
Speaker 1: Okay, now was there any such thing as a party--
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: --at Tuskegee for the students?
Speaker 2: Oh, we had dances.  Of course, naturally, they were together there but the typical, typical college, where you have certain things that you went to and nothing unusual that I can recall.
Speaker 1: Now did you have the black fraternities and sororities on campus?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we didn't have any fraternities, we had clubs.  It wasn't until 1936 that the fraternities came in.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I joined, for example, the Alpha [Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity] fraternity in 1936 or '37 [1937], I don't remember which, I would join the Alphas, but it was a graduate chapter.  We didn't have an undergraduate chapter of fraternities at that time.  They have it now but they didn't have it then.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I went into a graduate chapter because I was working.
Speaker 1: Now, what clubs are you a member of, or were you a member of any, of any of the clubs when you were in college (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) In club, yeah, it was called, we had names like KiYi [KiYi Club], and that was mine.
Speaker 1: Ki--how do you spell it?
Speaker 2: K-I-Y-I.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: KiYi.
Speaker 1: KiYi Club, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: It is mainly a social club?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was a social club.
Speaker 1: Okay, did you have like a, did somebody--did the people have to pledge to get in or how do they get in?
Speaker 2: Well, you had to pledge to get in, but that organization they invited you to join.  They had several of them but KiYi was the one I went into.  That's all I can tell you.
Story_ID: 402770
Speaker 1: --When you were in school [Tuskegee Normal and Industrial Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama] in those days, did they teach black history and, in school?  Was that a part of the curriculum (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Not black history, we had history.  We didn't have black history until many years later.
Speaker 1: I just wondered if they did, being a black college [HBCU], you know, and all?
Speaker 2: Not a black college, I mean not black history.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You got, you learned about black experiences and everything in, I mean, you're teaching college--teaching history but not specifically as they have it today.
Speaker 1: Okay, did they, did the students have to read 'Up From Slavery' ['Up From Slavery: An Autobiography,' Booker T. Washington] at--
Speaker 2: Yeah, that was, that was part of history, part of the history course.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Read books similar to that.
Speaker 1: Anything else, any other black books or black oriented books?
Speaker 2: I don't remember that far back what I had to take as a part of history.
Speaker 1: Do you remember, was Monroe Nathan Work there when you were in school?
Speaker 2: Dr. Work was head of the Department of Records and Research and he was the official person for the country to keep records on lynchings and things of that sort and it was called the 'Negro Year Book' ['Negro Year Book: An Annual Encyclopedia of the Negro,' ed. Monroe N. Work], I think that's what it was called.
Speaker 1: Right, the 'Negro Year Book,' that's right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, right, but he was the author of it and he kept the records, and the government relied on his recordkeeping to know about the number of lynchings that were going on all around the country, but particularly in the South.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But he had a yearbook that probably came out every year that gave you a complete record of all of the deaths from lynchings.
Speaker 1: And he also had records on the black population, how many lived in the South and the North and that sort of thing, right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, like a, sort of an almanac.
Speaker 2: Yeah, right, that's right, that's what it was--
Speaker 1: I know I saw it once.
Speaker 2: --but it was an official one.  The government relied on Tuskegee and Dr. Work, Monroe Work.  As a matter of fact, my wife worked for him as a student.
Speaker 1: Okay, so did you, so you met your wife at Tuskegee then, right?
Speaker 2: Mentioned, what?
Speaker 1: You met your wife there, right, at Tuskegee?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, my wife's from Chicago [Illinois]--
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: --from Evanston, Illinois.  She came down there about four years after I got there and we started going together when she came to Tuskegee.  We went together, I was about three or four years ahead of her.  So we were going together during her high school, and when I was, when she went on into college, I was working there so we continued to go together.  So we went together for eight years before we got married.  As soon as she graduated, we got married and we were married for over sixty-five years.  So we spent, pretty much time together for seventy-three years.  She died two years ago.
Speaker 1: Well, that's something.  That's something, you know, that's the kind of story you don't hear these days.
Speaker 2: I know you don't, right.
Speaker 1: That's something, but what's her name?  What was her name?
Speaker 2: Marianna, all one word, like Marianna, Florida.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: M-A-R-I-A-N-N-A, Hutcherson, H-U-T-C-H-E-R-S-O-N [Marianna Hutcherson Rabb], but she was from Evanston, Illinois.
Speaker 1: Okay, from Evanston, okay.
Speaker 2: From Evanston, Illinois.
Speaker 1: Right, I know.
Speaker 2: Right on the other side of Chicago here.
Speaker 1: Yes, sir.  Do you remember Robert Gomillion [sic.]?
Speaker 2: Who?
Speaker 1: Gomillion?
Speaker 2: Oh, Dr. Gomillion [Charles Goode Gomillion], sure.
Speaker 1: Right, okay.
Speaker 2: He taught history about, I figure, I had, in my high school, he taught history, Dr. Gomillion.
Speaker 1: Okay, I know he was active during the civil rights years and that sort of stuff, so.
Speaker 2: Oh, absolutely, yeah.
Speaker 1: But he was teaching when you were in high school?
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And he was fighting the battle for, of integration, while he was teaching, and the funny thing, you know, when blacks were activists in that sort of environment, many schools, you know, wouldn't permit a faculty member to be involved but doctor--but at Tuskegee, he was able to, to function as an activist, and go to court and win battles to get integration in Tuskegee, but Dr. Gomillion was, he was quite active.  He was well-known as an activist during the civil rights struggle.
Speaker 1: Now, you know, there's, yes sir (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) But he was a teacher of mine in answer to your question.
Story_ID: 402771
Speaker 1: Booker T. Washington, even today, is a kind of a controversial figure in some ways because people (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, he was controversial because the way, the emphasis that he was teaching.  People don't realize that when Booker Washington went there to found the school [Tuskegee State Normal School; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama], people were, he was dealing with slaves, of people just coming out of slavery, and he was criticized for focusing on teaching people trades.  For example, Du Bois [W.E.B. Du Bois] or, his focus was a higher education but Booker Washington had to prepare the students for what they were facing at that time.  So there was a conflict between the two of them as to what the Negro needed in education, but Booker Washington was trying to prepare them for what they had, what, I mean, for the life they had to live, he wanted them to get jobs.  So he was focusing on vocational things, subjects.  Just like I told you, every student had to take a trade and I took tailoring, for example.  I didn't choose it, my parents [Emma Farnandis Rabb and Allen Louis Rabb] told me, they said that, I mean, that's what, I want you to be in, so I went into it, in high school, but all students had to have some trade when I went there.
Speaker 1: Okay, now I was told, I don't know if this is the time to raise this but, I was told that you went to school with Ralph Ellison?  Was he at Tuskegee?
Speaker 2: We went to school together, he did, I wasn't with him, I was ahead of Ralph.  I knew Ralph Ellison just like I knew any other student but I was ahead of, I had graduated from Tuskegee, Ralph was still in school, but we were just friends.  Now I didn't, I never imagined that Ralph would be famous like he did, but, as students, but I always thought he was remarkable because he and another fellow named Albert Murray, who's a writer, they were real friends and they used to come around my room and talk with me and we would drink and do everything that students would normally do.  I had just graduated, but we were just friends, and after I had been working for Tuskegee for about three years, Ralph left Tuskegee before he graduated because he wanted to go to New York [New York] to be a writer.  He wanted to be with Richard Wright and all those writers, you see.
Story_ID: 402772
Speaker 1: So when I started working for the school, I worked for the school for about three years and I was, my job was giving jobs to students, that was my job.  First of all, I was in the dining hall area, I told you when Dr. Carver [George Washington Carver], when I had contact with Dr. Carver, so I have to go back to tell you about that.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: My first job, given me by Dr. Patterson [Frederick D. Patterson], was over in the cafeteria, but in my job at the cafeteria I was assistant to the director, and my responsibility was keeping stock, the storerooms and the refrigerators and things of that sort.  Most of the things that were eaten and prepared for eating came from our farms, that all the meats were butchered out there and sent to the dining hall to be put in refrigeration for the meats, for example, and that's when I met Dr. Carver for the first time, I had the contact with him.  A lot of people don't know but Dr. Carver lived in one of the dormitories, the boys' dormitories at Tuskegee [Tuskegee Normal and Industrial Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama], and one of the things that he would do, he used to come to the cafeteria to go in there, walk-in refrigerators, and cut fat meat off of the carcasses that he would use for cooking in his dormitory room.  Do you understand me?
Speaker 2: Now, now let's put this in perspective in a sense.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Now, Dr. George Washington Carver was world famous--
Speaker 1: He was, right.
Speaker 2: --and he made enough money, or could have--
Speaker 1: A lot of money, he could have, right--
Speaker 2: --if he wanted to (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) but Dr. Carver was very religious.  He felt that everything that he had done was given to him by God and he didn't want to commercialize on it, so he wouldn't.  He refused to commercialize any of it.
Speaker 2: So he basically chose to live like a monk, basically, in a lot of ways?  What do you think?
Speaker 1: Well, he chose a very religious life but he was so grateful to God for every--all of the skills and information that he had, which, you know, he developed so many items, from potatoes and peanuts and things of that sort.  It's well-known and a lot of people felt that he should commercialize on it and he could have, but he refused to do it.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I've heard that corporations made millions off of--
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, see, that's right, yeah, and--
Speaker 2: --his inventions.
Speaker 1: --Tuskegee, for example, the Tuskegee president felt that the school should be receiving some of that but Carver would not permit the school to get involved in that because he didn't feel that that was the right thing to do.
Speaker 2: So, was there a lot of friction between him and the school in terms of it?
Speaker 1: Well, a little bit, yeah.  It existed but I wasn't, I wasn't a part of knowing about it, just heard about it.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 402773
Speaker 1: Well go on and tell us about Dr. Carver [George Washington Carver].  You were telling us (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, I was just saying, the reason why I, that's the first time I had, other than that incident where I mentioned I first came and he asked me about the tree, I had no direct contact with Dr. Carver until I graduated from college and was given this job over in the dining hall, the cafeteria, and my job over there was taking, handling the stock, you know, the canned goods and things of that, and the meats and vegetables that came from the ag [agricultural] side but as a part of my job over there, was the storeroom, walk-in storeroom, where the meat was stored, and I was to take Dr. Carver back there and let him cut fat off of the carcasses and I had to do that for a couple of years.  So I got to know him so much so that he gave me an autographed picture of himself and everybody thought that was, well it was the greatest thing.  I'm happy to have that.  I'm very proud of the fact that I had that much contact with him for him to do that for me, that he gave it to me, and I have it, but that's the only way, that's the only contact I had with Dr. Carver, direct.  You see, other people who were taking agriculture, for example, they had classes under him, every day, but I didn't.  I had no real contact with him until I graduated from college and had this job.
Speaker 1: Yeah, but, do you have any good stories about him?  I mean, did he ever say anything that you really, that stuck with you as he, you know, went about his routine?
Speaker 2: No, no, I didn't, I didn't have any contact with him outside of the job that I was doing in the dining hall.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, you know, there's a rumor about him that--
Speaker 2: Okay, what's the rumor?
Speaker 1: --well the rumor, the, I've heard it a million times, somebody said that the reason why his voice was so high is that he was involved in a racial incident when he was younger and it was mutilated by some racist.  That was the, that was the story (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I don't know about it.  I know that, as a slave, I read about him being traded for a horse.  I remember something of that sort but don't know anything about what you're saying.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, well it's good to ask because I, people say it all the time and I don't know whether it's true or not.
Speaker 2: That may be true, I don't know.
Speaker 1: They never talked about that at Tuskegee [Tuskegee Normal and Industrial Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama]?
Speaker 2: No, he didn't talk about it, to my knowledge.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I said, I wasn't, you see, I wasn't in agriculture where he was teaching.  I had no contact with Dr. Carver at all, as a student.  It was only when I graduated and had this job where he had to come to get, walk into the refrigerators and cut fat off of, so I met him that way and had pretty good contact with him for a couple of years, and that's all, that's the only contact I had with Dr. Carver.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: I was admiring him like the world was, great man.
Speaker 1: Okay, yeah, I know at Tuskegee now, you can see these giant fruits and vegetables he grew and preserved (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yeah, all that kind of stuff, he did, oh yeah.
Speaker 1: And he made medicines out of herbs--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, yeah, I know about all of that.
Speaker 1: They said he could talk to the plants and he used to say he would actually talk--
Speaker 2: Well, I don't know about, maybe he could, I don't know.  Yeah, I didn't have anything to do with, I had no contact, I, some of his students could have answered that kind of question.
Speaker 1: Okay, now--
Speaker 2: For example, my next door neighbor was a, was a student in agriculture under Dr. Carver, had many classes with him, but I had no contact with him at all until I had this job.
Story_ID: 402774
Speaker 1: I was given a note I should ask you about Will Rogers speaking on campus.
Speaker 2: Will Rogers came to Tuskegee [Tuskegee Normal and Industrial Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama] it's like, Tus- people don't realize that most of the celebrities would visit Tuskegee because of Booker Washington [Booker T. Washington] and his reputation, he was well, well known but Will Rogers was just one of the celebrities who came to Tuskegee and he lectured in chapel, spoke to the students but he didn't stay there, maybe a couple of days, I don't remember, but I was, I remember one time when he was there, he spoke in chapel and all the students had to go, and I kid people now because I remember something that was said.  He said, "More important to me than the return on my money, is the return of my money."  He talked about investing, and that was his philosophy, and I said, I picked that up, that's my philosophy about investing.  I told a guy, you can talk about, you get a lot of money in return on your money and you get into this and that but he said, more important to me than return on my money, is the return of my money.  So he was very conservative about his investments, I assume.  But anyway, Will Rogers came to Tuskegee and he was a humorist, you know, and--
Speaker 1: Yeah, he was the number one humorist in America and--
Speaker 2: For the world, practically.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And everybody wanted to listen to Will Rogers, but he was just one person who, one of the celebrities who came to Tuskegee.
Speaker 1: He's a, so, I mean what you're telling us, though, is something that people looking at this in the future may not understand that he was a white humorist and not a (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yeah, oh absolutely, yeah, of course, but--
Speaker 1: --and so, so white celebrities would come to Tuskegee to speak.
Speaker 2: Oh, all celebrities came to Tuskegee.  All the presidents of the United States, came to Tuskegee, all of them, way back during Booker Washington's time.  You know, the white people, the Klan [Ku Klux Klan, KKK] for example, complained that Booker Washington had meals in Washington [D.C.] sitting with the president in those days but that actually happened.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think it was Teddy Roosevelt [President Theodore Roosevelt, Jr.].
Speaker 2: There are a lot of things that people don't realize that Booker Washington was consulted by the presidents, all presidents at that time, when they were going to do anything that involved trying to do something for the Negro.
Story_ID: 402775
Speaker 1: For example, after World War I [WWI], they didn't have a veterans' hospital where blacks could go.  They came to Tuskegee [Tuskegee Normal and Industrial Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama] and said, "We want to build a hospital for blacks, a veterans' hospital."  Tuskegee gave the United States government the land.  Of course we had about five thousand acres, gave the land to the V- to the government to build the black hospital [Tuskegee Home; Central Alabama Veterans Health Care System East Campus] at Tuskegee, and at one time it was the fifth largest hospital, veterans' hospital in the country.  It had 2400 beds at one time.
Speaker 2: Yeah, now that's a story that's kind of, it's unusual in that, I know after the Civil War, black soldiers who were veterans could go to the regular VA [Veterans Administration; U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs].
Speaker 1: That's what I'm trying to, yeah.
Speaker 2: But things had, had changed that much by the time of World War II [WWII], where there's a separate VA for black soldiers.
Speaker 1: Yes, they were separate and so they were building one, this is after World War I, now--
Speaker 2: Yes sir.
Speaker 1: --not World War II, World War I, that they came to Tuskegee to ask about building one for blacks, and that's why they went ahead and built it at Tuskegee but it was at Tuskegee's land.  Of course the school gave the land to the government, I guess for a dollar or whatever it is, whatever they had to go to, but he gave the land to the government to start the hospital.  That's how it was created.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And there, again, they're talking about the Klan [Ku Klux Klan, KKK].  Tuskegee insisted that whoever headed that hospital would be black.  Klan wanted the white person to be head of it and Tuskegee said, no, it's going to be a black person, and it remained a black person through the years until the recent years, last 15, 20, 35 years, the integration came, you finally had a white person in charge, but it wasn't because blacks or, were saying that we don't want anything but blacks because, it went, when integration came, it was just a normal procedure of selecting whoever was qualified.
Speaker 2: I see.
Speaker 1: But in those days, Tuskegee insisted that the head of it would be black and, as I recall, I don't remember.  I guess it must have been in the '50s [1950s] or something, the '50s [1950s] or '60s [1960s] when they finally got a white person who was in charge but you had integration then so there was no problem.
Story_ID: 402776
Speaker 1: I told you that I was given a job when I graduated by the third president of Tuskegee [Tuskegee Normal and Industrial Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama], Dr. Frederick Patterson [Frederick D. Patterson].  He became president to succeed Dr. Moton [Robert Russa Moton], he became president on June 1st, 1935.  I graduated from Tuskegee at the end of May 1935 and he employed me.  Well, I worked on the cafeteria for a year so, but Tuskegee had a policy that every, every student had to work.  So, I was shifted over to giving jobs to students.  Do you understand me?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: My title was secretary of labor, giving jobs to students.  I gave the jobs to all who were required to work, some job.  I worked in that field for about three years doing that, and this is unusual.  I remember Dr. Patterson called me to his office, and he frightened me to death because I didn't know what he was calling, what he was calling me to his office for.  I was giving jobs to students.  He said, "Rabb [HistoryMaker Louis Rabb], you're doing a good job in the assignment that you have."  He says, "We are sending you to Columbia [Columbia University], in New York [New York], to get your master's degree in personnel work."  Didn't ask me if I wanted to go, we are sending you.  He said, we're paying all your expenses, (unclear), for paying, everything, your salary, which they did, but I had to go and I went.  I went up there and got a degree in personnel administration, came on back, giving jobs to students.
Speaker 2: Well, how was, now this is a big adventure.  Here you're leaving (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) It was.
Speaker 2: --you've only been to two places and then you go to--
Speaker 1: I had to go, man, that was a cultural shock.  I had never been to school, I had never been to a big city and I was, never been to school with white people, and I knew nothing about being in the city.  I couldn't stay in the dormitories up there so I stayed at the Y [Harlem YMCA, New York, New York] on 135th Street, that's where I had to live.
Speaker 2: Okay, in Harlem [New York, New York], 'cause a lot of people--
Speaker 1: In Harlem, right.
Speaker 2: --don't know that Columbia is in Harlem but--
Speaker 1: Yeah, but, I know that.
Speaker 2: --a little further away from--
Speaker 1: I was up on Amsterdam [Amsterdam Avenue], really.
Speaker 2: --yeah, right, up on Amsterdam.
Speaker 1: But it is, you're right, but there was where I continued my relationship with Ralph Ellison.
Speaker 2: Ralph Ellison, okay.
Speaker 1: He had gone up there a year before, I told you, because he wanted to be a writer, but he knew that I was up there so he used to come by the Y to pick me up to go to his place, you know, to eat and drink and all that sort of thing.  We were just friends, we just, he hadn't written 'Invisible Man' [Ralph Ellison] then.  He was writing it, but we continued our friendship while I was in school up there, you see, and so, I just knew him.  So when the book was written, he gave me one and, of course, he autographed it and everything but the funny thing about Ralph that a lot of people didn't know, Ralph Ellison was also a musician, and he was a part of the band at Tuskegee, and I gave him, because he was one of the top musicians in the band, they would have band practice all during the week and if the band director didn't get there on time, Ralph was carrying the, was taking the band through the regular practice, so I nicknamed him, Sousa, as of John Philip Sousa.  You understand me?  So all the time he was at Tuskegee, my name for him was Sousa, but we were good friends.  So when he wrote the book and sent me one of the first ones, he said, he wrote in the book and said, Mike, you know, everything he said, and it talked about the days that we were in school together when my name for him was Sousa and he had all this in there, as a part of the description, see, and it was funny because I always called him Sousa.  It was a nickname that I had given him because of what he was doing as a part of the band, but he was a musician.  A lot of people didn't know that, but he was just a good friend of mine and he knew I was up there in New York by myself and he had been up there for a year or so and he used to come by and pick me up to go to his place to eat and drink, as a part of something to do.

Speaker 1: Did you know Ella Baker in Harlem [New York, New York] in those days 'cause I think she was at Columbia [Columbia University, New York, New York] in--
Speaker 2: No, I'm, listen, you see, I'm just a country boy up there (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: --didn't know anything about New York [New York].
Speaker 1: Well, she was too at that time.  I mean, a lot of these people were.  They'd just come up from the country too.
Speaker 2: Yeah I know but I'm saying, but I was, I didn't know any of those people.  I just went up there because I was forced to go.
Speaker 1: Well I thought I'd ask and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I understand, but the only person I knew up there was, was Ralph [Ralph Ellison].  He knew I was, the school that sent me up there, and he used to come by and pick me up because we were just continuing a relationship we had at Tuskegee [Tuskegee Normal and Industrial Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama].  I was ahead (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I think, I think [HistoryMaker] Dorothy Height was there too.
Speaker 2: What?
Speaker 1: Dorothy Height was up there too, around that same time that you--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, I know, but all those people came to Tuskegee, Dorothy Height and everybody else.  Lena Horne, every, every celebrity came to Tuskegee.
Speaker 1: But I'm talking about in Harlem in those days, doing--
Speaker 2: No, in those days I did not have no contact with any of them.
Speaker 1: Did you ever meet any of the other writers up there (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No.
Speaker 1: --like Richard Wright or, and--
Speaker 2: No, never did. I had no con-
Speaker 1: --Margaret Walker--
Speaker 2: None.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: Not once.
Story_ID: 402778
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Only person I knew was Ralph [Ralph Ellison] and Albert Murray, because they were both in school [Tuskegee Normal and Industrial Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama] and used to come to my room all the time 'cause I had graduated and I was working there and I was living in one of the dormitories and maybe to come by, we would drink together and it was like, it's like carrying on the same relationship we had--
Speaker 2: Now, what was Albert--yes sir, but what was Albert Murray like?  I know that some of the students of his work are going to look at this at some point and, what can you tell us about Albert Murray?
Speaker 1: Just the same type of person as Ralph.  They were always together and they would come to my room.  We were just good friends, that's all, nothing unusual, but we just, both of them, became pretty famous, and writers and they would write books, they would send me a copy, autographed and everything, and messages in it, and I have about six of Albert's books.  I have two of Ralph's.  I have 'Shadow and Act' [Ralph Ellison] and I have 'Invisible Man' [Ralph Ellison] but he didn't do much writing after those two, Ralph Ellison didn't (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, they said that he had writer's block or something, they said.
Speaker 1: What?  Oh, yeah, I know, yes, sure.  I understand all that, yeah.
Speaker 2: I know they've said he's had, he had writer's block and couldn't--
Speaker 1: Right, I understand that, yeah.  And actually one of the books he was writing was destroyed in a fire, but I knew them very, very well, was nothing unusual about it.  Hell, we were just friends, that's all, just happened they became famous.
Speaker 2: Are there any other aspects of life in Harlem [New York, New York] you want to tell us about in those days, or life at Columbia [Columbia University, New York, New York]?  You were mostly with white students, right?
Speaker 1: Well, I was, that was personal.  I just never been around white people before and never been in a class with a white person, it was just, it was just a cultural shock for me.
Speaker 2: But how did it make you feel?  I mean being--
Speaker 1: I can't tell you, I mean, it was uncomfortable, that's all I can tell you, but I had to do it but I got my master's degree and went on back to Tuskegee, giving jobs to students.
Speaker 2: So (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And I continued to do that--
Story_ID: 402779
Speaker 1: What was your major in grad school?  What was your degree in?
Speaker 2: I was taking, in Columbia [Columbia University, New York, New York]?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Personnel administration.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But the interesting part about, about my going, going there and coming back to Tuskegee [Tuskegee Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama], after I came back to Tuskegee, I continued to give jobs to students for about three or four more years, and the president [Frederick D. Patterson] called me up again and it happened.  I told you Tuskegee had a hospital [John A. Andrew Memorial Hospital, Tuskegee, Alabama], 150-bed hospital that it owned, controlled and operated.  So the president called me again, he says, "Rabb [HistoryMaker Louis Rabb], you think you'd be interested in hospital work?"  I said, "No, I wouldn't be."  He said, "Well, we're going to expand the program over there, I think it would be a good opportunity for you."  He said, "Why don't you go over there during the summer part time and see how you like it.  If you don't like it, you can continue to work giving jobs to students as secretary of labor."  When I got over there, I found that I liked it.  So, I transferred to the hospital, working in the business office.  I wasn't trained, I was just working in the office, and I worked there about three years, and they called me up again.  It happened that the trustees wanted to, I mean the school wanted to expand the hospital program but they wouldn't.  Basil O'Connor, who was chairman of the board, a law partner of Franklin Roosevelt [President Franklin Delano Roosevelt], and also president of the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis [March of Dimes Foundation], he was the chairman of our board.  He told the trustees, we won't do it unless you have a hospital administrator.  Well, there was only one black trained hospital administrator in the United States, and that was Billy Burbridge [Charles E. Burbridge] who was up at Freedmen's [Freedmen's Hospital; Howard University Hospital] in Washington [D.C.].  So, the school realized they would not be going to be able to expand the hospital without a hospital administrator so they told Mr. O'Connor, but we have somebody at Tuskegee that we would like to send away to get training in hospital administration.  So that's when the president called me up and says, "We are sending you away, we are sending you to get your degree in hospital administration."  They didn't ask me if I wanted to go, we'll pay all your expenses, pay all for the schooling and your salary, in which they did, but I went away the second time, not because I wanted to go, but because the school was sending me to go.
Speaker 1: Now where did they send you this time?  Back to Columbia?
Speaker 2: I could choose, there were four schools of hospital administration in the country, University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois], Minnesota [University of Minnesota Twin Cities, Minneapolis, Minnesota], Yale [Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut] and Columbia.  So I applied to all three, all four.  They all accepted me.  I went up to see how the focus on each one of the schools.  So I chose Northwestern [Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois], right here in Chicago [Illinois].  So I got my master's degree in hospital administration from Northwestern in 1948.  So I went back to Tuskegee again, and I'm still working at the hospital, and that's when they made me administrator, head of the hospital, and I worked there for thirty years as the hospital administrator.
Speaker 1: Okay, thirty years, okay, now--
Speaker 2: And then the hosp- they were deciding that they were going to stop the hospital program.  So I transferred, they trans- the president transferred me to the president's office as assistant to the president.  So the last eight years of my tenure at Tuskegee I served as assistant to the president and continued as secretary to the board of trustees.  Do you understand me?
Speaker 1: Okay, yeah.
Speaker 2: But I, while I was at the, administrator of the hospital, I was secretary to the board also.  I was secretary to the board for twenty-eight years.
Story_ID: 402780
Speaker 1: I wanted to backtrack some to go back to the era of World War II [WWII] now.  Now, when did you get your first master's degree?  When was the first one?
Speaker 2: Nineteen forty-two [1942], in Columbia [Columbia University, New York, New York].
Speaker 1: Okay, that's 1942.
Speaker 2: In 1948, at Northwestern [Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois] in Chicago [Illinois], 1948.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now, did your wife [Marianna Hutcherson Rabb] go with you--
Speaker 2: No, no, no.
Speaker 1: --'cause she's from Evanston [Illinois].  I just thought she might have (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, well, she used to come up here to meetings twice a year.  I used to come to meetings at the American Hospital Association and also to one, the American College of Hospital Administrators.  So there are two different times I would come to Chicago.  She would come with me.  She'd go home and to visit with her father [Fred Hutcherson, Jr.] and things of, but she had no connection with what I was coming up here for.
Story_ID: 402781
Speaker 1: During World War II [WWII], well in '42 [1942], you were in New York [New York] but when you, did you have any contact with the Tuskegee Airmen when you went back to the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) There were, no, no, no, back in those days, they were training.  No, I was in New York in school [Columbia University, New York, New York].  No, no.  I didn't have any con- I wasn't involved in the training program at all.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was, the school [Tuskegee Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama] got me deferred so they could keep me as a worker in the program.  So I knew all of the airmen, the Tuskegee Airmen, but I wasn't a part of the program.
Speaker 1: Okay, did they change the atmosphere of the campus by all these young, bright individuals?
Speaker 2: I guess, well, the atmosphere changed but when they were, when the black airmen, the students, would go off the campus, like downtown or to Montgomery [Alabama], they were still black.  They'd still have to conform to all of the usual rules and regulations that, between whites and blacks at that time.  So it was a lot of conflict on their part because they were coming from all over the country, New York, every, they were all parts, coming there as students, so they weren't accustomed to all this segregation.  So they had to adjust.  They had problems.  Well, you know all about it.  It's all in the history books (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, I just wondered do you have any stories about any of this?  Are there any stories that you remember about some of the conflicts that they had that you could share with us?
Speaker 2: No, because I wasn't a part of it but I knew they had problems because they would do things, you know, that, just the whites just didn't permit and they would have, they would go into places where they shouldn't, where they weren't permitted to go and there was big problems, yeah.
Speaker 1: Were you on campus when Eleanor Roosevelt came and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, sure.
Speaker 1: --rode in the plane?
Speaker 2: Sure, yeah.
Speaker 1: What was that like, I mean, for the campus to have her come down?
Speaker 2: Well, naturally, we were happy about it because she came down, she said, because in Washington [D.C.], her husband, the president [President Franklin Delano Roosevelt], and all the people told her that blacks didn't have the mental capacity to be able to fly a plane.  So she came down to Tuskegee [Alabama] when they heard about the fact that Chief Anderson [C. Alfred "Chief" Anderson] was training these black boys to fly.  So she went up in a plane herself, so she could go back and tell him, I know they can fly because one of them flew me around, see, but, and I mean, the interesting thing, the [U.S.] Secret Service told her, "Mrs. Roosevelt, you cannot go up in the plane."  She reminded them that she is the wife of the president and she could do whatever she wanted to do.  So she went up, she flew, but after that, America changed.  When Truman [President Harry S. Truman] came in, you know, he broke up that business about having a separate, white and black flying, people flying.  So they were integrated after that but it was because she had come down there and had flown with the person who was training these black boys.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now--
Speaker 2: But that's well known, it's all in the history books.
Speaker 1: Well, I just wanted your, your personal perspective on it, so (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, I just, I was experiencing it just like everybody else.  I wasn't a part of the training program.
Speaker 1: Well, we rarely get to talk to somebody who was actually there, you know.  I mean--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I knew a lot of the flyers, that's like, for example, back there now at Tuskegee.  One of my closest friends was Colonel Carter [HistoryMaker Herbert Carter], who was a member of the Tuskegee Airmen.
Speaker 1: What's his first name?
Speaker 2: Eugene.
Speaker 1: Eugene Carter, okay.
Speaker 2: His first name is Herbert, H-E-R-B-E-R-T, Herbert Eugene Carter.  He and his wife [Mildred Hemmons Carter] are living, and incidentally, his wife took the training while the black fellows were in training at Tuskegee.  She learned to fly also.  She has a pilot's too, one of the first women to get a pilot's license.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But they're just good friends of mine.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And it just happens that Carter was, is from Mississippi also.  He's from Alcorn [sic. Amory, Mississippi], which is twenty, thirty miles from Columbus [Mississippi].
Speaker 1: Okay, so, Columbus is (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So I've known him, I've known him and his family for a long time--
Speaker 1: That's like northern--
Speaker 2: --but he's just a friend of mine at Tuskegee.
Speaker 1: Now, that's northern Mississippi, right?  That's northern, right?
Speaker 2: More northern, yes, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But it's, I mean, the mid line.  We're in the northern part of Mississippi.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, of course, Amory [Mississippi] is about twenty or thirty miles north of Columbus but we're right from the same area.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I've known him since I was in school.  He's younger, about seven or eight years.
Story_ID: 402782
Speaker 1: In terms of hospital administration--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Did you, what can you tell us about the, the Tuskegee syphilis experiment [Tuskegee Study of Untreated Syphilis in the Negro Male]?  You know, there have been plays written, 'Miss Evers' Boys' [David Feldshuh] is on Broadway and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, you know, I was talking to somebody, I was talking to somebody about that last night.  A fellow wrote a book, 'Bad Blood,' ['Bad Blood: The Tuskegee Syphilis Experiment,' James H. Jones] I don't know if you know about it, but he came to Tuskegee [Tuskegee Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama] after I had come back from Northwestern [Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois], I was working over as administrator of the hospital [John A. Andrew Memorial Hospital, Tuskegee, Alabama] and he was interviewing me, and I told him that I didn't know anything about the syphilis program.  Hell, that started, that thing started when I was in high school, but he had thought that I was a part of it and he was asking me questions as though, and it made me mad as hell that he was asking me of questions as though I was a part of the experiment work, and I knew nothing about it, and he said, "You should have known."  I said, "Goddammit, how in the hell do you think I should have known something when I'm in high school."  I didn't know a thing about it.  I didn't know a thing about it in college.  It was, I was over there a couple of years before I learned anything about it because I would hear the people, the doctors and everything talking about it and I would be there when the United States Public Health Service would come down, they were the ones who were doing the work.  And a lot of people don't realize that, that this thing was being conducted by the United States Public Health Service.  They were using our facility because we had a facility at Tuskegee and Tuskegee admitted it.  The bad part was, that when they discovered penicillin, they didn't give it to these black people, these black patients.  They continued to treat them the way they would, they wanted to see the effects of syphilis during their lifetime, until they died, and that's why they were criticized, and they were, and they should have criticized them for it, but it was being conducted by the United States Public Health Service--
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: --but they thought that Tuskegee, it all started there and we did the whole thing but that wasn't the case.
Speaker 1: Now the woman that's portrayed in the play, 'Miss Evers' Boys'--
Speaker 2: Her name was Eunice [Eunice Rivers Laurie], her name was Eunice Evers [sic.] until she got married.  She married a fellow named Rivers, who worked at the hospital.  Ms. Eunice Rivers was a nurse and she was the one who had relationships with all of the patients and she could talk to them and ask them to come in, you know, to get these treatments, or whatever it is, she could persuade them to come.  So, she got to be known as practically the mother of all of them.  So they was Mrs.--
Speaker 1: Miss Evers' boys.
Speaker 2: --Miss Evers' boys, that's how she got the title, and the reputation, because she had the connection with them, with their families and everything, and she could get them to come in to let the United States Public Health Service perform whatever they were doing.  So that's why they called it, 'Miss Evans' Boys' [sic.], or 'Evers' Boys,' whatever.
Speaker 1: And your, well--
Speaker 2: But she was Eunice Evers before she got married.
Speaker 1: Right, now did, did she know what was going on with the United States Public Health Service?
Speaker 2: I imagine she did, yeah, but she, I don't know, I can't tell you because I wasn't at the hospital at that time.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was just in school or working, I just didn't have any contact with the hospital.
Story_ID: 402783
Speaker 1: Well tell us this though, at some point the school [Tuskegee Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama] and the hospital found out what was going on.  Can you tell us what happened, how you all found out and what happened?
Speaker 2: Well, I was not a part of the administration.  I don't know what was going on.  I didn't know a thing about it.  That's all I can say.  Well, we all know that it wasn't a good thing.  We know that but I learned it just like the public had learned it.  I wasn't a part of it.
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I, what I'm trying to get at is how did you all react to it when you found out what was really going on.  I mean, what did--
Speaker 2: Oh, it's the same way the public react to it, I mean reacted.
Speaker 1: Well, it's a little different 'cause you all were there.  I mean, we, other people weren't there, though.
Speaker 2: I know but we reacted just like everybody else, I guess, because I know I did.  A lot of my friends did so I assumed that everybody else was reacting the same way.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was not a good thing when they discovered penicillin.  They should have stopped the program [Tuskegee Study of Untreated Syphilis in the Negro Male] right then and started giving the penicillin.  There's no question about that.  Nobody defends the action that was going on after they discovered penicillin.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know I read a book back in the '70s [1970s], I think, Charles Spurgeon Johnson [Charles S. Johnson], you know--
Speaker 2: I don't know about it.
Speaker 1: --in the '40s [1940s], was writing about it and he apparently didn't understand what was going on either.  He thought it was something else when it was really--
Speaker 2: But, I mean, a lot of people don't understand, before that program started, Tuskegee cooperated with the United States Public Health Service in doing a lot of good things through John Andrew Hospital [John A. Andrew Memorial Hospital] in Tuskegee that helped a lot of people, a lot of good programs, but it was the syphilis study, the one that they were criticized for, and they should have been criticized for it, but the thing was being done by the United States Public Health Service.
Speaker 1: Now do you know--
Speaker 2: Tuskegee was going along with it, I guess until they knew what was going on and the criticism that everybody was making at, I guess so, I wasn't a part of the administration so I can't tell you.
Speaker 1: So, they didn't, when did they reveal that what was going on?  I mean, you weren't the administrator when they were reviewing the--
Speaker 2: No, no, no, that was way before--I told you, I was in high school when the thing started.
Speaker 1: Yeah, when it started but when--
Speaker 2: And in college, I didn't have any contact with or didn't know--
Speaker 1: No, all I'm asking is that when they actually found out, you were the administrator when they found out, right?
Speaker 2: No--
Speaker 1: I guess, I mean.
Speaker 2: --I can't say, no--
Speaker 1: I think it was revealed in the '70s [1970s] and you were, you were there until--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was there in the '70s [1970s], yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know, that's when it became--
Speaker 2: But I learned about it like everybody else did.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's what I'm telling you.
Speaker 1: Now I know when you go to--
Speaker 2: But this guy [James H. Jones] was telling me that, as a high school student, I should have been knowing all about it and--
Speaker 1: But that's unfair.  How could you--
Speaker 2: I know that but that just made me mad, that was all.
Speaker 1: All right.  I agree with you.  There's no way that you could know, in those days, okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Story_ID: 402784
Speaker 1: As a high school student, I wasn't interested in the hospital work or what Tuskegee [Tuskegee Normal and Industrial Institute; Tuskegee University; Tuskegee, Alabama], it just happened that Tuskegee had a hospital, that was unusual, but Booker Washington's [Booker T. Washington] feeling all along, that in addition to training all these people coming out of slavery, no need to train them unless they had good health.  So, healthcare was a part of the Tuskegee program.
Speaker 2: Now, there's still a healthcare facility there, right, in, at Tuskegee?
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, I mean, we just closed the, we were giving, last year I was at John Andrew Hosp- well, John Andrew Hospital [John A. Andrew Memorial Hospital, Tuskegee, Alabama] became a dumping ground because we took blacks when they didn't have money, and the white hospitals in the area didn't want to take blacks in the first place, but particularly since they had no insurance and no money.  So they would dump them all at John Andrew Hospital because we had quality care that they couldn't get anywhere else.  Our doctors were board certified in so many specialties.  So we were all able to give good service.  The last year I was over there, there are sixty-seven counties in Alabama, the last year I was over there, we had patients coming to us from thirty-four of the sixty-seven counties.  Can you imagine a woman, getting ready to have a baby for example, having to go 250 miles because she could get free care instead of coming by all these white hospitals that wouldn't take 'em, or some baby with some disease who, with some ailment that would require him to be in the hospital for months, for example, in those days.  They wouldn't take them.  They'd just dump them all in John Andrew Hospital.  You cannot run a hospital unless you can have money and nobody was paying it so the school decided it could not subsidize a program like that any longer.  So that's why they closed it.
Speaker 2: So, when did the hospital close?
Speaker 1: As I--I don't know because I had left.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I left the hospital in 1974 to become assistant to the president [Luther H. Foster, Jr.].  I think it was probably around '80 [1980] or '81 [1981] or '2 [1982], something like that, that's when the school closed it.
Speaker 2: Okay, did the other schools have hospitals (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) No, no.
Speaker 2: --in, I think, what's the one, the school in Montgomery [Alabama]--
Speaker 1: No, no--
Speaker 2: --Alabama State [Alabama State University, Montgomery, Alabama], or--
Speaker 1: No, most unusual for a school to have a hospital like we did.
Speaker 2: Okay, so, Alabama State didn't have anything or--
Speaker 1: No, no.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I don't know of any other school.
Speaker 2: Okay, that's, there are very few medical facilities for black people.
Speaker 1: Yeah, the closest thing you would have was Howard University [Washington, D.C.], at Freedmen's [Freedmen's Hospital; Howard University Hospital] in Washington [D.C.].  That's the closest, and it wasn't the same arrangement that Tuskegee had.  Tuskegee owned the facility.  Everybody who worked at the hospital was an employee of Tuskegee Univ- Tuskegee Institute.  We just happened that we were assigned to the hospital.
Story_ID: 402785
Speaker 1: --I wanted to ask you about the Civil Rights Movement in Tuskegee [Tuskegee Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama].  We had (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) We had the same experiences everybody else did.  It just happens that we were closer to some of it because Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was right there in Montgomery [Alabama] and because Fred Gray, who's the lawyer, he's in Tuskegee [Alabama] and he lives there.  He's got a big law firm, and he was the lawyer for Martin Luther King and Rosa Parks.
Speaker 1: Now when did you, there's a story about how you met Dr. King, right?  I mean, there's a story.
Speaker 2: Dr. King?
Speaker 1: Yes sir.
Speaker 2: I didn't meet him, as you say, but, well, it's a long story there.  At the John Andrew Hospital [John A. Andrew Memorial Hospital, Tuskegee, Alabama], a group of doctors formed, back in 1913, what they called the John A. Andrew Clinical Society where they would have the top people in the field of medicine to come to Tuskegee to give demonstrations to the black doctors who couldn't attend the white organization meetings like the American Medical Association, blacks couldn't.  So the people at Tuskegee, they formed a group called the National Medical Association.  They couldn't attend the other one so they had all these top white people to come to Tuskegee for a week to lecture and to give the type of care that wasn't ordinarily available for the patients during the year.
Speaker 1: Okay, so the National Medical Association was formed at Tuskegee?  Or, I mean--
Speaker 2: No, no, I'm talking about the John Andrew Clinical Society.
Speaker 1: Okay, they joined the National Medical Association.
Speaker 2: Yeah, right, and, but we did bring all of the top people in the field of medicine down there for a week to lecture and to treat patients, and that went on for many years until complete integration, where the black doctors could go to the medical, I mean to join and be a part of the white organization.

Speaker 1: Who was John Andrew?  I'm, you know, I'm sitting here, I'm thinking (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I can tell you, it's a long story.  John Andrew, or John Albion Andrew was a governor of Massachusetts, and he was governor during the war.  He was called a war governor.
Speaker 1: That's during the Civil War, right?
Speaker 2: That could have been.
Speaker 1: Yes sir, that's Governor Andrew that started the 54th Massachusetts [54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry Regiment].
Speaker 2: Okay, well he was the governor of Massachusetts--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --but his granddaughter [Elizabeth Mason] was a member of our board of trustees of Tuskegee [Tuskegee Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama].  That's long before I was involved with the trustee board.  She gave the first donation for Tuskegee to build a hospital.  Do you understand me?
Speaker 1: Yes sir.
Speaker 2: And she named, she gave it in the name of her grandfather who was named John Albion Andrew, John A. Andrew.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's the Governor Andrew in the movie 'Glory,' that they talked about.
Speaker 2: That's the, that was the one who was, well she was a member of our board of trustees and Tuskegee wanted to build a hospital, didn't have any money so she gave the first, I mean, she gave the first money to build it.  Then she continued to give money afterwards, but that's the reason why it was named John Andrew Hospital [John A. Andrew Memorial Hospital, Tuskegee, Alabama] because of him, her grandfather, that's how it all started.
Speaker 1: Now that raises another point too.  When you go to the, now I've been to the campus of Tuskegee and when you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And you do what?
Speaker 1: When you go to Tuskegee's campus--
Speaker 2: Through the campus?
Speaker 1: When you walk on the campus--
Speaker 2: Yeah, okay.
Speaker 1: --there are lots of buildings--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: --and buildings and--
Speaker 2: They're named for various people.
Speaker 1: --named for various people--
Speaker 2: Yeah, right.
Speaker 1: --but there's so many buildings now, I mean, it seems like at one time, everybody I guess thought it was a good thing to have a building built at Tuskegee, but it seems to be more buildings than can be used right now and there are a lot of them are just sitting, you know, I mean, there are quite a few that are just sitting now with nothing going on in 'em, like the old hospital, I guess, about seven years ago was empty, just a empty building, you know, and--
Speaker 2: Well, when they stopped the hospital program, it was empty, but during the time that I was administrator, we really tore down the old hospital and built the new one.  All that was done in my tenure as administrator.  We built a new hospital.  Well then when Tuskegee closed it, you had this new facility over there that was not being used, but I'm sure you heard about during the time that Clinton [President William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton] was president, he apologized to Tuskegee and the syphilis patients for having used them in that way.  As a result of it, they gave a lot of money to Tuskegee to create a bioethics program.  So they converted the hospital building to this new program called, and this is the Bioethics Center [National Center for Bioethics in Research and Health Care].  That's the name of it now but the building that was built under mine when I was administrator at the hospital, that is, it was, the whole of the unit was gutted and made so that it could accommodate this new program, bioethics.  So now that's what the hospital was being used for, and I went through it just recently, the past few months, and there's nothing in that building now that would give you any indication that it was ever a hospital because they made it for, to accommodate the bioethics program, which they should have done, but it's still owned by the school and everybody works in that program is a member of the faculty and staff of Tuskegee University.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It's a nice thing, but they got a lot of money to do it from the Clinton administration, when Clinton was president.
Story_ID: 402787
Speaker 1: Now, you were secretary for the board, right, of Tuskegee [Tuskegee Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama], right?
Speaker 2: But all of this happened, the reason I'm a secretary to the board until 1981.  I was secretary to the board during Foster's [Luther H. Foster, Jr.] administration.  He was the fourth president.  He succeeded Patterson [Frederick D. Patterson] but when he became president, he was a friend of mine.  I was always, remember, he came to my house, I was outside cutting grass, he came to my house all the time, we were friends, and he said, "Mike [HistoryMaker Louis Rabb], I'd like for you to, I would like for you to do something for me."  I said, "Well Luther, whatever you want me to do I'll--," he said, "I just came out to let you know that the trustees have just elected me president, okay, and I would like for you to do me a favor."  I said, "Okay, whatever, Luther, I can help."  He says, "I want you to serve as secretary to the board of trustees."  I said, "Luther, I don't know a thing about being a secretary."  He said, "Well, you only have to do regular secretary work, but they want to be sure that we have somebody who can attend all the meetings and record, you know, the results of what decisions are made and not go out and talk about it."  So that was the reason why, he knew me and wanted me to serve as secretary to the board.  So I told him, okay, and I started.  That was 1953 when he became president and I was secretary all during his administration, during his tenure, as a president.  I think it was about twenty-eight years, just what I said.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He retired the same time I retired.
Speaker 1: So it's about 1981 then?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: Until '81 [1981], 1981.
Speaker 2: Until '81 [1981], yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I remember that the last assignment that the board gave me was to organize and conduct and coordinate a program to get a president to succeed Foster, and I coordinated the search process that brought the present president there, Payton [Benjamin F. Payton], but that was the last thing that I, the last connection I had with the, I mean with the school.  I lived there and, but I'm not a part of the, not a part of, under the Tuskegee program.
Speaker 1: Now, when you were board secretary, now I've--
Speaker 2: You said when I was secretary?
Speaker 1: Yes, when you were board secretary, now you often had to host board members and--
Speaker 2: Didn't have to, well I didn't have--
Speaker 1: Or you often did.
Speaker 2: I did, right.
Speaker 1: You did, all right, you didn't have to but you did and I, now somebody told me, one of your family members said that you had liquor in your house in a dry county and it was--
Speaker 2: And, well, yeah, well Macon County [Alabama] was dry so the president couldn't serve alcoholic beverages in his place.  So he, it just happened that, I guess I'm just a friendly person, I know a lot of people, and I used to take some of the trustees out to my house to drink, and before dinner, of course they would have a big dinner at the end of the meetings on, and so they, I would invite, some of them that come out and they started and the other trustees would tell others about going to Mike's house to have drinks.  So, practically all of them just came out there to my house and we had drinks and everything, and they're all over my house but I got to know a lot of the trustees much better in a social setting than I had in the official setting as the secretary to the board.  So I knew a lot of them and they were real nice (simultaneous).
Story_ID: 402788
Speaker 1: You have any interesting stories about some of the board members [at Tuskegee Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama]?
Speaker 2: Well, no, well I have one and it got to the point where practically all of them were coming to my house, you see, because they were accustomed to having a drink before dinner and I remember one time, there were so many out there, and they were getting ready to have the dinner up on the campus, and the president [Luther H. Foster, Jr.] had to call me, he said, "Mike [HistoryMaker Louis Rabb], will you please bring the trustees up here so we could have dinner (laughter)."  It was so funny but they all enjoyed themselves.
Speaker 1: They're having too much fun.
Speaker 2: And we enjoyed having them.  And one of the persons who was on the board, is a member of the board, was William Schieffelin [William Jay Schieffelin III].  He was the grandson of the former chairman of the board when I was in high school.  His grandfather [William Jay Schieffelin] was chairman of the board, but he was elected a member of the board, but he had still Schieffelin and Company [Schieffelin and Somerset Co.] where it was operating in New York City [New York, New York].  He was an importer of all the great, the best wines, brandies and scotches, particularly Teacher's [Teacher's Highland Cream] scotch, and he was a member of the board but when he first got on the board, because of, he knew me, and he used to come to my house all the time and he was very friendly with my wife [Marianna Hutcherson Rabb].  So we were just good friends, but he used to provide a lot of whiskies when he would come, for me, for me.  He wasn't giving me to give to the trustees but he just wanted to do things like that so I was very fortunate to get a lot of whiskies that I wasn't asking for, but he just wanted to do something.  So I'd get plenty of scotches and brandies and good wines and things of that sort but he just wanted to do it, he was just a friendly fellow, but I learned a lot, I learned a lot from the trustees when they would come to the house through the years.  I just learned a lot about them and, and it kept me, I was closer to them because of that but it didn't start anything official, just something that we started out, my wife and I, having them come out and enjoy themselves and then we'd go on back to the campus but over the years it got to the point where most of them would come to the house--
Speaker 1: So it was a regular thing?
Speaker 2: A regular thing, yeah.
Speaker 1: If not an official thing, it was a regular, yeah, okay.
Speaker 2: It was a lot of, it was a lot of fun.  It was a lot of fun, yeah, but it was a good experience and it got, I got to know them better and they got to know me better, you know,  Well, this is just a natural process.
Speaker 1: I know when I walked across the campus, I just thought that maybe, this is just a, maybe this doesn't make any sense but it just seems, it seemed like at one time people would want to, people who would donate to Tuskegee seemed to want to donate a building rather than anything else, and did you have, did the board have a hard time trying to redirect their energy 'cause I think people, you know, tend to want to name buildings after themselves and there were so many buildings on the campus but--
Speaker 2: Well, I don't know how the administration handled that but I just don't know how they handled it, but they did have a lot of buildings that are named for, because Tuskegee, from the times that, of the Mellons, the Rockefellers, the Rosenwald, Julius Rosenwald.  Julius Rosenwald was a member of the board, and I remember when we were building the new hospital [John A. Andrew Memorial Hospital, Tuskegee, Alabama] during my administration, under my tenure as administrator, I was building this new facility, and during that time the proper thing to do was to build for the future.  So I had to ask for a shell floor above the hospital so that you could expand in later years, and one of the persons who was opposed to spending any more money was, was Mr. Rosenwald, William Rosenwald, who was the son of Julius Rosenwald.  So there's plenty of money, and he was opposed to the shell floor because they didn't have the money to do it, but I understood that, but in the end, he was the one who gave the money for the shell floor.  That was funny but they had money so it was not a problem but we did get the shell floor.  That was because he decided to give the money himself.  All he was, in the board meeting, he was opposed to building the shell floor.
Story_ID: 402789
Speaker 1: When you look back on your career as assistant to the president [Luther H. Foster, Jr.], when you were assistant to the president--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --what was the highlight of that period of time?
Speaker 2: I don't remember any particular highlights that I can, if I thought about it for a long time, maybe I could think of something, but that was just my job.
Speaker 1: Okay, and when you look at the campus [of Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama] now, when you look back at--
Speaker 2: I can tell you one thing, it's a beautiful thing to see now.  Payton [Benjamin F. Payton] has spent a lot of money beautifying the campus, and of course we've had a lot of expansions there under, I mean during his tenure as president.
Speaker 1: Now I've seen the Kellogg Center [Kellogg Hotel and Conference Center, Tuskegee, Alabama] was new, I think, when I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The Kellogg Center is what I'm talking about, that's new, and all of that happened within the last twenty-five years.  I've been retired now for twenty-six years but it was during those times that the Kellogg people gave all this money to expand that particular unit.  It used to be called Dorothy Hall.  It was a women's dormitory facility back in the, in the teens [1910s] and '20s [1920s], early '20s [1920s] because when my wife [Marianna Hutcherson Rabb] came to Tuskegee, it was a trade building for, for women who were getting into dietetics and sewing and things of that sort.  It was women's industries, part of it, but the other part was a guest house for the people, to outstanding people who would come to Tuskegee.  It was called Dorothy Hall at that time but when Kellogg gave all this money, it became a center, it became a continuing education facility and that's what it is now.  It's a nice facility.  It's wonderful.
Speaker 1: It is, it's beautiful.
Speaker 2: Oh, have you been to it?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: You, well, you know what I'm talking about.
Speaker 1: The, one thing that did trouble me, though--
Speaker 2: What?
Speaker 1: --when I was on the campus, in the library [Hollis Burke Frissell Library; Ford Motor Company Library/Learning Resource Center, Tuskegee, Alabama], we went in there looking for--
Speaker 2: Well they've got a, they gutted the library now, everything is computerized and everything.
Speaker 1: Okay, 'cause in ninety--I guess it was 1999, the library was leaking, there was--
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, they've completely done the whole building over.
Speaker 1: Okay, and there were like only--
Speaker 2: They had to close it until they did everything.
Speaker 1: Well we were concerned, there was a group of us from Chicago [Illinois] there, we were concerned about the history being lost because of the water coming in.
Speaker 2: Well, a lot of that may have been.
Speaker 1: But we were looking at the 'Negro Year Book' ['Negro Year Book: An Annual Encyclopedia of the Negro] by Monroe Nathan Work, there's only two copies of it there.
Speaker 2: Well, that's, well you see, Mr. Work's office was in that building, on the lower floor in the back.  I remember those days but the building's nice, really nice.  If you went back there today, you would be very pleased with what they have done.
Speaker 1: Well I'm glad because, you know--
Speaker 2: A lot of the money came from the Ford Found- the Ford people.  You know Henry Ford and George Carver [George Washington Carver] were good friends, Henry Ford, Ford Motor Company [Dearborn, Michigan].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He used to come to Tuskegee all the time just to talk with Dr. Carver but they were, he tried to get Dr. Carver to come and work with him, and Dr. Carver said he couldn't leave Tuskegee.
Speaker 1: It's hard to persuade a man who doesn't, is not motivated by money, I guess, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, but, yeah but he did try to get Dr. Carver to come work with him, but they were good friends that he used to come down to see Dr. Carver all the time but the Ford Foundation [New York, New York] gave a lot of money for the library for all these renovations that have gone over the past three or four years.
Speaker 1: Okay, now we always, are there any other stories about Tuskegee that I haven't asked you about that you think we ought we need to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I don't know, I probably do, but I can't think of anything unusual that I would want to tell you.  If you ask me tomorrow or next week or something, about something, yeah, I can probably have something to say but I can't think of anything right now to volunteer to tell you.
Speaker 1: Well let me just say this, it seems though you've been very, I mean, you've had such a long history with Tuskegee and--
Speaker 2: Well I have, that's true.
Speaker 1: --you've been very loyal to the school and--
Speaker 2: What?
Speaker 1: --very loyal to the school and--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah sure.
Speaker 1: --I mean, always on call, they send you to graduate school and you don't want to go and you go anyway--
Speaker 2: Yeah, well I had a reason to be, wouldn't you too, wouldn't you do it also?  Wouldn't you be?  Yes, I was, yeah.
Story_ID: 402790
Speaker 1: One thing I haven't touched upon is that you've lived in the same house for a long time, right?
Speaker 2: Well, yes, I've been in it fifty-five years, but I've expanded it, and improved it, you wouldn't think it.  If you were in it, you wouldn't think I've been there five, six years because I was very fortunate because, of course of my brother [Maurice F. Rabb, Sr.] and because of my wife's father.  They were both very supportive of, and they would give us money to do things that we couldn't have been able to afford.  So the house is a nice house, and a lot of people come to it all the time, and it's just a nice house.  I think you would say it, the same thing if you were in it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I'm just fortunate I had people, two people, who were so kind to us, my brother and her father.
Speaker 1: Now what was her father's name?  Your wife's father?
Speaker 2: Fred, Fred Hutcherson [Fred Hutcherson, Jr.].
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now when you look back at, at everything that you've done to this point, is there any major thing that you would do differently?
Speaker 2: I've been very fortunate.  I can't, I can't say it because a lot of things that, that came to me, had nothing to do with my efforts unless it was just working hard and being friendly and being, handling myself in the proper manner for the people who want to do things for me.  I'm just very, very lucky.
Speaker 1: Well people must have (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I'm very thankful.
Speaker 1: The administration of Tuskegee [Tuskegee Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama] really must have seen some value in you?  I mean, you know.
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, no question about it, yeah, well I hope so.
Speaker 1: They sent you to, they kept sending you to school and--
Speaker 2: Well, I didn't ask for it so--
Speaker 1: And they picked you for a very important job, you know, for--
Speaker 2: Maybe so, I can't, I can't say but I'll just say, I've been fortunate.
Story_ID: 402791
Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns for the black community today?
Speaker 2: You ask me something I haven't been thinking about, thinking about what you're asking me now, but to give you a decent answer, I just, I just don't know.  I hadn't thought about it.  I probably thought about some things and I just don't know.
Speaker 1: Okay, when you look back--
Speaker 2: I'm happy about all the things, all the changes that have come about in the last twenty, twenty-five years, just like any other, just like you are, and everybody else would be.  The South is quite different from what it was particularly Montgomery [Alabama].  It's just a different world all together and it's really gratifying to be a part of it now as compared to what it was in those days when the Klan [Ku Klux Klan, KKK] and George Wallace and all that sort of thing, so it's just a different place.
Speaker 1: Now are there any things that you hope will change for the better in the future or--
Speaker 2: That has changed--
Speaker 1: No, that, that you hope will change for the better in the future or, or--
Speaker 2: It's not too bad right now but I hadn't thought about it in that way.  You see, being retired now, I'm just not in the loop, with the things that are going on.
Speaker 1: Well when you reflect on what young people are doing today, do you have any advice for young people in general or young people that want to be involved in university administration or--
Speaker 2: No, no, I don't.  When I retired, maybe I shouldn't have been that way, maybe I shouldn't be that way, but I worked for Tuskegee [Tuskegee Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama] for forty-six years and while I was working I used to have people who would retire and they would come back by their offices, you know, to, to talk with people who were working, and they would take up people's time who were working, and without realizing it and I said to myself, if I ever retired, I was going to retire, I wasn't going to be coming back to the campus all the time, walking around, I just completely divorced myself from the campus program, and I'm enjoying myself.
Story_ID: 402792
Speaker 1: So, what do you do with your time?  Do you--
Speaker 2: Well, travel, play golf and things of that sort.  My wife [Marianna Hutcherson Rabb] and I traveled quite a bit before she died.  For example, we went to the Orient twice.  We went there in '74 [1974], we couldn't get into China, so we went to Japan, a lot of cities in Japan, Bangkok [Thailand], Hong Kong, but we couldn't get into China so we went all the way back home, spent three weeks over there, around those places, went all the way back ten years later when China opened up and let people in, she said, "Mike [HistoryMaker Louis Rabb], I still want to go to China."  We went all the way back over there and spent eighteen days in China alone, various, about eight different cities.  So went over there, back there twice but she likes the Orient and liked the culture, a lot of things about it.  If you went in our house, you would think that it was a Japanese house almost because she likes things like that.
Speaker 1: Okay, well tell us about your family.  Now, do you have children and--
Speaker 2: I had a daughter.  She went to Fisk [Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee], I thought I told you that.  She went to Fisk, got her degree there, went, got a master's degree from Tennessee State [Tennessee State University], right there in Nashville [Tennessee] and went to Buffalo [New York] to teach.  And she taught up there for many years until she had, she was afflicted with colon cancer, and she died.  She died about six or seven years before my wife died.
Speaker 1: Okay, and your daughter's name was--
Speaker 2: Marsha [Marsha Rabb], M-A-R-S-H-A.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Marsha.
Speaker 1: All right.  So do you have any grandchildren or anything?
Speaker 2: No, no, no.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I only had one child, one daughter, she didn't get married.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She didn't choose to do it.  Pretty girl but she just didn't want to get married.
Speaker 1: Okay, and you're still playing golf at age--
Speaker 2: Every day that I can.  I play with guys who are twenty and thirty years younger than I am and some of them have responsibilities and they're not free to go, you see, I'm free to go every day 'cause I have nothing to do.  I don't have a wife anymore, I'm alone, so I play as often as I can.  I like to play golf.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was a tennis player when I was in school.  I was on the tennis team and I enjoyed it.  Well, some friends came to Tuskegee [Tuskegee Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama] to work and they were golfers so they encouraged me to learn and I did and I liked the game so I just kept playing golf.
Speaker 1: Do you have any suggestions as to how people can live as long as you have and still be active?
Speaker 2: I could do what?
Speaker 1: How people can remain active when they get to be ninety--you're ninety-one, right, or--
Speaker 2: I'm ninety-two.
Speaker 1: Ninety-two, okay.
Speaker 2: I'll be ninety-three in October.
Speaker 1: All right, well how do you stay so active?
Speaker 2: It's just a part of me to be active, that's the first thing but I do all of my yard work and I don't have a riding mower, and I had a garden because my next door neighbor graduated from Tuskegee in horticulture, and he had a garden so he encouraged me to have a garden with him.  So I had a garden for many years.  But I play golf and I take tai chi classes, you know about tai chi, and I just exercise anyway, just normally.  That's a part of me.
Story_ID: 402793
Speaker 1: When you look back at everything you've done up to this point, what do you consider today to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: The only thing I can say is the service that I tried to provide, Tuskegee [Tuskegee Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama], the university I'm talking about.  Of course I did try to do a good job and apparently I must have done a decent job because the school wouldn't have done for me what they did.  I'm very grateful for the fact that they sent me away to school to get two master's degrees.
Story_ID: 402794
Speaker 1: We had a story that emerged (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) But he came to Tuskegee [Tuskegee Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama]--
Speaker 1: Well, Joe Louis, let's just go back.  Joe Louis--
Speaker 2: Joe Louis.
Speaker 1: --came to Tuskegee--
Speaker 2: Tuskegee, he was heavyweight champion of the world at the time and he wanted to play, he had brought his pro with him.  So--
Speaker 1: This is an early black golf pro--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, right, yeah.
Speaker 1: --and his name is well-known but we just can't think of it right now, okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I just can't think of it right now.  I could have called it this morning, anytime, because he came with Joe Louis, and since I played golf, the school called a friend of mine, Dr. Russell Brown [Russell W. Brown] who was a golfer, he taught me to play golf but because of us playing golf all together, we had a picture made with Joe Louis on our golf course, and I have the picture from back in the '40s [1940s], in the early '40s [1940s] and I'm very happy to have it also, and people want copies of it but I have some nice pictures of playing golf with Joe Louis.
Speaker 1: Do you have any reflections on Joe Louis' personality?  I know they said he was so generous he'd give away so much money every day that he (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, I don't know about that.  I know just like you know but I don't know anything about it, but I just have this picture with Joe Louis.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, two, a couple of 'em--
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: --but he's just one of the celebrities who came to Tuskegee.
Story_ID: 402795
Speaker 1: Is there anything I haven't asked you that you think we ought to talk about before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: I can't think of anything.  I couldn't think of all the things that you asked.  I've tried to answer them as forthright as I could.
Speaker 1: Okay, well the last question is something like legacy but a little different.  How would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: Oh, that's a normal question you ask everybody, I guess.  I was just, having been a good citizen of Tuskegee [Tuskegee Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama] and having done a good job as, during my tenure at Tuskegee and I, that I'm doing things now to help people.  For example, a lot of my friends, my age, are older and they can't do things that I can do.  I have to drive them to the doctors and things of that sort, and I do that, and, because I can and I can afford to do it.  So, I still try to be as helpful I can to everybody and as friendly as I can to be, everybody.  I don't get enjoyment in talking politics and they often try to get you to do it, I say, no.  I just try to be a good citizen, that's all, and try to treat everybody right.
