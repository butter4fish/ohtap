Speaker 2: Yeah.

Speaker 1: No?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay, any thoughts on where that inspiration came from?
Speaker 2: Well, I, I had drums, and I--the teacher, we--she had instruments in kindergarten.  And we could play them, and that's when she said that I seemed to have a sense of rhythm.  I, I didn't--I'm not talking about complex rhythms, but rudimentary rhythms.
Speaker 1: Okay, but it was still early in kindergarten.  So--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --you could learn about the other rhythms.

Speaker 1: --with the Cleveland Symphony Orchestra [sic. Cleveland Orchestra]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Did you start with the cello as a child?
Speaker 2: Ah, no, I started with the cello when I was sixteen and a half.
Speaker 1: Um-hm, so what was your first (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It was very late.
Speaker 1: What was your first musical instrument?
Speaker 2: Trumpet, and my brother bought a trumpet, and he took lessons, and when he returned, he tried to tell me what he learned.
Speaker 1: So your brother is studying in school or privately in--
Speaker 2: Privately.
Speaker 1: Um-hm, okay.  And which brother was that?
Speaker 2: The oldest brother over me.
Speaker 1: And his name again?
Speaker 2: Joseph White [ph.].
Speaker 1: Joseph, okay.  So you start out playing the trumpet.  And then do you go from trumpet to cello?
Speaker 2: I went to bass tuba.
Speaker 1: To bass tuba.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And how long did you play the bass tuba.
Speaker 2: Well, I--there was no openings in the, in the ba--school band, and the conductor convinced me that I should play tuba, that he needed a tuba.  And it's sousaphone, a big bell over the head and all that.
Speaker 1: I think I've seen one of those in marching bands.
Speaker 2: Yeah, sure.
Speaker 1: But at that point in time, are you studying privately also when you're playing the--
Speaker 2: I studied the tuba privately, yeah.
Speaker 1: All right, and then what instrument after the tuba?
Speaker 2: Well, the cello was at sixteen and a half.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was very late to start the cello.  It's usually five or six or seven or something like that.
Speaker 1: So what made you decide to switch from the--
Speaker 2: My sister.  I had--the school administration convinced her to play the cello, and they--she had an instrument, school instrument to play.  And she didn't like it.  And I loved it.  I loved it, I fell in love with the cello right away.  And I--then I took it up.
Speaker 1: Well, Mr. White, it sounds like you had a, sort of a musical family, or at least several children in the family.
Speaker 2: Well, my, my parents didn't--always encourage us to play some musical instrument.  My brother played the trumpet--and so forth and so on.
Speaker 1: Were your parents also musicians?
Speaker 2: Nah, nah, they weren't musicians.  They were, they were hard workers.
Speaker 1: And what kind of work did they do?
Speaker 2: My father [Benjamin White] was a janitor at International Harvester Company, and my mother [Ada Miller White] was a maid at the local hospital.
Speaker 1: So she combined raising the children and--
Speaker 2: Yes--
Speaker 1: --working outside the home, too (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, she, she didn't--she worked after we were a little older.  She was home with us.
Story_ID: 237768
Speaker 1: Can you share with us some, some of your memories of holidays and special occasions at home in Indiana?
Speaker 2: Well, I had a lot of relatives in Anderson, Indiana and around close.  And there was a lot of visiting.  We--our family used to have a Model T Ford [Ford Model T], and we would go to places near Anderson, Indiana and Kokomo [Indiana] and places.  They were very close.  Our--a lot of our relatives came over to visit us, uncles--my mother's [Ada Miller White] brothers, my mother's brothers.  She was from a large family, and she had, she had five--four brothers and five sisters.  And they, they all visited us.
Speaker 1: On the holidays?
Speaker 2: Any time.
Speaker 1: Oh, they'd just drop in.
Speaker 2: Yeah.

Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: What were Christmas and Thanksgiving dinners like?  Were those big family (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, they were big, yeah.  But we didn't have, what they have today.  My mother cooked in a big pot and everything for the family.  And she was very good.  She--my older sister, Dorothy [ph.], did a lot to help her, and they did a lot of cooking and all of that.
Story_ID: 237769
Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] Mr. [Donald] White, you said just a little while ago that by the time you were sixteen and a half--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --you were serious about learning to play the cello.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And do you remember the teacher's name you were studying with?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Mrs. Metcalf [ph.].
Speaker 1: And did you meet her at school or outside of the school?
Speaker 2: She was outside.  She taught cello.  She was the only cello teacher in Richmond [Indiana] that I--as far as I know.
Speaker 1: And were you a serious, a very serious student, practicing a lot--
Speaker 2: I practiced (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) at that age?
Speaker 2: --a lot, yeah.  I bought records, classical records and things.  I, I had a job at a hospital, and I bought records, 'William Tell Overture' [Gioachino Rossini] and all that.  Those rudimentary kind of pieces that everybody starts with.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you're working while you're in high school?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: And that's paying for--well, some, helping to finance your love for music in buying those records?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what high school did you attend?
Speaker 2: Richmond High School [Richmond, Indiana].
Speaker 1: Richmond High.  What year did you graduate from the high school?
Speaker 2: Oh, it was the year I was drafted into the [U.S.] Navy--eighteen, I guess.  I was eighteen.
Speaker 1: Okay, so maybe around 1943?
Speaker 2: Forty-three [1943], yeah, yes.
Speaker 1: So that would have been during the era of World War II [WWII].
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Story_ID: 237770
Speaker 1: Now, you were, again, serious about music at the time of your high school [Richmond High School, Richmond, Indiana] graduation.  Were you able to continue with the music while you were in the [U.S.] Navy or--
Speaker 2: No (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) or how did that work?
Speaker 2: When I went in the Navy, I had to take boot training.  And that was obligatory, that--in the Navy and after I got out of the Navy because I had experience on the bass tuba, I had, I got in the band.  It was an all-Negro Navy, of course, in those days.  And they were forming an orchestra for, for Negroes, and they wanted to have a string section.  So that was two reasons why I got in the band.  I was, I played, played tuba, and then I, I was cello--I was, I'm using the word very broadly.  I was a cellist, I was, I was studying the cello.  I didn't, I didn't play the cello (laughter).
Speaker 1: Not at that point.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) No, not at all.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But my mother [Ada Miller White] did a very good, a wonderful thing because I had bought a Kay [Musical Instrument Company] cello.  That's the cheapest cello that you buy.  And my mother sent, sent it when I was taking boot training in the Navy.  She sent, she packed the cello, and she, she and my father [Benjamin White] packed the cello with excelsior and paper in a big box and sent it up.  And it arrived without any scratches or anything wrong with it.
Speaker 1: Good.
Speaker 2: My mother was--she was instigate--she was a big instigator of that, those kind of things.
Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] Mr. [Donald] White, that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The company commander I had was, wanted to know what that big package was outside the barracks.  And I, he--I told him it was a cello.  And he said, "You have to have it out by evening."  So I had to--had to take it down to the drill hall.  And gave--and I had the organist for the church services keep, keep it.
Story_ID: 237771
Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] Mr. [Donald] White, that era of World War II [WWII] is a very important one in American history.  So I'd like to spend a few minutes talking about your experiences during the wartime in America?
Speaker 2: Yeah, the wartime was--Walter Winchell used to have it.  He would say it was, it was, it was concentration camp for Negroes.  And it was, it was an obscene thing for, for fellas that--and the WAVES [Women Accepted for Volunteer Emergency Service], the WAVES, it was a whorehouse.  And for the, for the white guys, they were, they exploited all the, all--everything, and they didn't care.  Well, one thing that happened when I was in the [U.S.] Navy, when they used to haul us in trucks, groups of us, and they would say--this guy would say, there's--"There goes a pile of coal."
Speaker 1: Oh, for all the black troops?
Speaker 2: Yeah, and it was, oh, it was a very prejudice place.  While I was up there in the service, there were a lot of very good musicians who were drafted up there, too, in the Navy.  And so they formed a string quartet and then two violinists who I knew later, much later in Chicago [Illinois] were in the quartet, and then Frank Miller, the first cellist of the NBC Symphony [Orchestra] was up there.  And I went to see him, and he, he was very impressed with my ambition and everything.  And I talked to him.  I, I didn't, I didn't have much--I wasn't bashful about talking (laughter).
Story_ID: 237772
Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] Mr. [Donald] White, I wonder if you have any memories of--from December 7th, 1941 with the bombing of Pearl Harbor [Naval Station Pearl Harbor, Hawaii]?  Do you remember your reaction initially to the U.S. involvement in World War II [WWII] from that point on?
Speaker 2: No, I don't--I was too young.  I, I was--
Speaker 1: Don't really remember the day?
Speaker 2: I knew it was a catastrophic event and everything, and all that, but I didn't, I didn't feel anything personally about it.  It was a horrible thing that had happened, but I was too young to get, get the real meaning of a Pearl Harbor and all of that.
Speaker 1: So at that point, you weren't really thinking that you'd be drafted--
Speaker 2: No--
Speaker 1: --in the [U.S.] military?
Speaker 2: No, I--well, I thought I would be drafted.  I thought--everybody was drafted in those days.
Speaker 1: Well, may I ask about your experiences in the [U.S.] Navy since, as you said, it's still a, the military is still very much segregated at that point.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: What kinds of opportunities were available for African American men to serve in the Navy?
Speaker 2: There wasn't any, any category of serving and getting up in rank, was very, very few.  It was--Negroes that were drafted, like I said, it was, it was a, it was a draft Navy, a draft service.  And in those days, and it was impossible to get anything, any kind of consideration of trying to, of going higher or getting decent jobs even with the Navy--
Story_ID: 237773
Speaker 1: I've read and also heard some testimony from [U.S. military] veterans that many of the African American servicemen were in mess units--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yes, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Was that true?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that was the big unit that Negroes were serving in.
Speaker 1: So your musical skills opened up another opportunity for you to serve?
Speaker 2: Well, I was in the [U.S.] Navy with--it was a time when a lot of Negroes of great fame--they were--I was eighteen, but in those times, the Navy was full of thirty-five and forty-year old men.  And a lot of those men were from big bands and what--there were a lot of--Clark Terry was in the Navy with me.  I still go see him when I--he's eighty, he's way over eighty years old.  He has diabetes like I do, too, and, and Willie ["the Lion"] Smith is, alto player with Count Basie, and--
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: --and there's a, there's a lot of very big jazz men in the Navy then.  But not many--there was a guy from Brooklyn [New York, New York] was a violinist.  And we were the "Long Hairs."  One guy used to say, I'm--he used to call me (unclear).  That's, with a surname would likely--you know.  (Unclear) 'cause it was my name.  And--
Speaker 1: (DOLORES WHITE):  (Unclear).
Speaker 2: We went into Chicago Symphony [Orchestra] concerts a lot because we got in free, in--
Speaker 1: As enlisted men?
Speaker 2: Yeah, enlisted, yeah, we got in free, yeah.  And while I was in the Navy, I met, I went--after I got through boot training, I was through with, I was in the band, and I had a lot of, I had--we played bond rallies in Chicago [Illinois] and that sort of thing.  And we played on base, but a lot of, a lot of days were free.  After playing 'Colors' in the morning, we were free.  And if we were free, we could go on liberty and go, go down to Chicago and the transportation was free in Chicago.  We could go anywhere in town in the USO [United Service Organizations] on the South Side [Chicago, Illinois] and then the--or the events--downtown.  We were free to go and everything, and the transportation was free.  You could get on a bus or train, the bus--any means of transportation, the subway and go for nothing.
Speaker 1: Now, is that if you're in uniform or--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah--
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: --yeah.
Story_ID: 237774
Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] Mr. [Donald] White, you mentioned that you played for bond rallies.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Can you just tell me how those worked, why were they selling bonds?
Speaker 2: Well, we'd play--we would in The Loop of Chicago [Illinois], march around and stop and stop traffic and play the music.  And then they would take up money for the, for bond rallies.  So that was called, what it was called, was money for the--it was a nationwide thing to raise money.  And our conductor was Len Balden [ph.].  I never will forget his name 'cause he wasn't very good, a good musician.  He--I asked him once, David Rose wrote 'Holiday for Strings,' I think it was, and he said, he said--I asked him one day what, what--"Who wrote 'Holiday for Strings'?"  He says, "Oh, anybody would know that's Len, that's--some long-haired musician," (laughter).  And he didn't know, he didn't know anything.  He was, he was a--he got the job because he was, he was like a big talker.
Story_ID: 244004
Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] Mr. [Donald] White, you were telling us in the last segment about your experiences in the [U.S.] Navy during World War II [WWII], telling us about the bond rallies that you played for and also about the segregation.  But I know that that was the era of the Tuskegee Airmen as well (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --with new opportunities opening up at least in the [United States] Army Air Corps for blacks to serve in different capacities.  Do you see the same kinds of opportunities opening up in the Navy?
Speaker 2: I met a few--well, I got a lot of early (unclear) in the evening, and I met a cellist by the name of Nicolai Zedeler.  He was a cellist in the Korean--in the, in the Chicago Symphony [Orchestra], and he studied, he studied, he played at the American--he taught at the American Conservatory of Music [Chicago, Illinois].  And he took me on, and he did a lot for me, and helped me, helped my finger position and everything.  And he was very, very helpful for me.  He sent me--he went on vacation, and he went to Biloxi, Mississippi, and he sent me a card saying, "Wish you were here," (laughter).  And I said, "No, you don't," (laughter).  In those day in Biloxi was the worst place in the world to begin--going to, for a vacation or any other reason.
Story_ID: 244005
Speaker 1: My mother [Ada Miller White] used to come up when I was, you know, play a solo on cello.  And I, I was, I remember doing a student concerto, and I, I banged it up.  My mother was there, and I felt awful, and I, I was--I wasn't ready for it.  And I--my mother wouldn't--she was very, very complimentary and everything, everything. She, she did it to keep my spirits up.  I know I played very badly, and so she came up and she came up for every program, every performance.  She, she found a lady on the South Side [Chicago, Illinois] that she liked very much, and she came up to see her, and then, make it a double trip and double reasons, to hear me and to visit with the lady.  I've forgotten her name.  She just--and she was always that way.
Story_ID: 244006
Speaker 1: So, [HistoryMaker] Mr. [Donald] White, you said you made some important contacts musically, while you were in the [U.S.] military.  But when do you leave the [U.S.] Navy?
Speaker 2: Nineteen forty-three [1943].
Speaker 1: You leave?
Speaker 2: No, no, 1943--it was three years (unclear)--
Speaker 1: (DOLORES WHITE):  It must have been after the, World War [II, WWII]--after the second war in '45 [1945] or '46 [1946].
Speaker 2: And so after--
Speaker 1: Forty-six [1946], I guess.
Speaker 2: Okay, so after the war is officially over in 1945.  Then you leave the Navy?
Speaker 1: Yeah, I was discharged at Lambert Field [St. Louis International Airport/Lambert Field] in St. Louis [Missouri].
Speaker 2: Okay, and then do you go to college after the Navy?
Speaker 1: Yeah, I went to college--Earlham College, a Quaker school in Richmond, Indiana.
Speaker 2: Earlham?
Speaker 1: Earlham.
Speaker 2: Earlham.
Speaker 1: (DOLORES WHITE):  A year.
Speaker 2: And after the year at Earlham, do you continue your studies?
Speaker 1: Yeah, I left--after Earlham, I left after a year because it didn't have enough music.  It was a Quaker school, and they had, they had a very good course, and it was a very good--I, academics were very good, but there was no music.  And I wanted to go to--I wanted to go where I could pursue music.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And so I went to Chicago [Illinois] then.
Speaker 2: Yeah, lots of music in Chicago.  Where'd you study in Chicago?
Speaker 1: American Conservatory [of Music, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Then after, shortly after I'd gotten in the American Conservatory--American--I don't think I'm very clear.  I don't--
Speaker 2: You're doing fine.
Speaker 1: But I was, I, I enrolled at Roosevelt College [Chicago Musical College, Chicago, Illinois]--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --Roosevelt College, and I studied, I studied with Karl Fruh. He was a very good cellist.  He was first cellist with NBC Symphony [Orchestra], NBC orchestra and this is a broadcast orchestra.  In those days, they had musicians on, on live music for big radio stations and it was (unclear).  And he was, he was--he did a lot for me, and he, he studied--I studied with him.
Story_ID: 244007
Speaker 1: Once he [Karl Fruh] had, once he wasn't able to play a string quartet engagement in the South Side [Chicago, Illinois], a very, very big hall for music lovers and all of that.  And he got me to play in his place.  And I, when I finished, they--there was an envelope, they gave each one of us, and I opened it when I got home.  It was fifty dollars.  In those days, that was a very big amount of money.  And I was flabbergasted.  I was, and I called Fruh--he died about two or three years ago.  And the girl wrote her notes in that [HistoryMaker] Donald White was one time a pupil of Karl Fruh.  And it was in his obituary, or things that they had done.  And he was a very good friend.  I studied also with the principal cellist for the Chicago Symphony [Orchestra], Dudley Powers, and he gave me a scholarship for a year in the orchestra.  And then I, I had--I benefited from that.  He gave me long lessons and everything, and it was--and I was in the orchestra, and we used to have sectional rehearsals for cellos alone where everybody would--and violins and cellos and so forth, and I--he took up a lot of time with me, and I was--there was a lot of cellists who were much better than me, but I was, I was--I didn't have a car.  I couldn't drive in Chicago [Illinois], and I went from all over town with the cello in a cloth cover in cold weather and everything, you know.  And then I, North Side and to the South Side, I was everywhere.  I lived in such a bad neighborhood, but in those days, it wasn't, wasn't vicious.  And everything--I used to get off the subway and go and walk home.  It was about six blocks from, to my home, and I would say I was--on the North Side playing a session or something, you know, and guys wouldn't bother me.  I, I never was harmed.  And it was not a very good neighborhood.

Speaker 1: So, [HistoryMaker] Mr. [Donald] White, you--since you're studying at Roosevelt [College, Chicago Musical College, Chicago, Illinois] after leaving the [U.S.] Navy, were you able to finance any part of your education with the G.I. Bill [Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944]?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, all of it.
Speaker 1: All of it, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yes, sure.
Speaker 1: And just the private lessons, you said you received a scholarship for that too?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was working--I worked at the post office, in and out.  We lived, I lived--a guy over on the second floor of his apartment, and he was a very ambitious Negro, and he was, he got to be the first postmaster general of Chicago [Illinois] postal system.  His name was Henry [W.] McGee [Sr.].  And he was a, the first postmaster.  I still correspond with his son [Henry W. McGee, Jr.] in, out in Seattle [Washington] now.  He's, he was spoiled (unclear)--he's, he was at UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California] before he was in Seattle.  And he studied, he was (unclear) black studies at UCLA.  And once--when I got in the Cleveland Orchestra, we went to St. Louis [Missouri]--Los Angeles [California] was a big stop, and we played everywhere.  And when he came down from Seattle to see us, and we had a very good time, and talking about old times (unclear).  He, he played the violin sort of badly, and he, he got to be very big in academics.  And he was, he has a son who went to UCLA, and he was, he got to be a big shot.
Story_ID: 244009
Speaker 1: How long did you study at Roosevelt [College, Chicago Musical College, Chicago, Illinois]?  Was it one year at Earlham [College, Richmond, Indiana]?  And then did you finish out the undergrad?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was--I got a degree and--it's four, four years at Roosevelt.
Speaker 1: Oh, so you completed the bachelor's degree--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --at Roosevelt in Chicago [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: I, I had trouble.  I, I thought I was better than I was, but I didn't--I took, I did some (unclear) I didn't get in.  And many times, it was because I was not, not discriminated against, but I wasn't good enough.  And I, I would be the first one to say that.  It's, it's only fair for me.  Then I went to, in frustration, I went, left Chicago and went to New York [New York].  And when I auditioned for the Civic Orchestra [sic. National Orchestral Association] in New York in the Lincoln Center [for the Performing Arts, New York, New York] on--down the street from (unclear)--I've forgotten where it is.  But (unclear) I got a dress factory job, and I would take the cello to work every Wednesday on the, on the subway, and I didn't have a, I didn't have a hard cover.  I had to keep it (unclear), very, very dangerous.  And then I would walk over to city center from the, from the job when I was--I'd go from work to the city center where the orchestra rehearsed.  And they rehearsed on Wednesday.  They, they rehearsed.  There were more rehearsals put on Wednesday.  There was a broadcast on WKYC [sic. WNYC and WQXR].  It's the music station in Chicago [sic.] and New York.  And he, he had--once I was, I was almost late, and I could--there's secretary that sits outside, and lets people in, and I had to tell her all that.  So she said, "Well, you've got three minutes.  You're just in time."  She opened the door and I was in.  And so [Leon] Barzin, the conductor, he was very well known, and he was very sharp tongue, and he said, "Oh, hello, Mr. [Gregor] Piatigorsky.  How are you?"  And I said, "Oh, I'll go out."  And he says, "Or is it Mr. [Pablo] Casals," some famous cellist.  I said, "No, I'll go out."  He said, "No, please, sit down and join us."  And I--he--it's one of the many, many funny stories happened that night.
Story_ID: 244010
Speaker 1: Another thing about [Leon] Barzin, he was, he was--long after I'd been in the Cleveland Orchestra, I saw him in Carnegie Hall [New York, New York].  And he--I said, and there was a percussionist, you--I've forgotten her name.  She was a percussionist in orchestra in the ballet orchestra.  He had the ballet orchestra.  And she went out to San Francisco [California] and--
Speaker 2: (DOLORES WHITE):  Elayne Jones.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Elayne Jones.  And she ran, she ran into a lot of trouble and everything.  And I said, "Did you hear about Elayne Jones?"  He said, "Oh, yes.  It's a shame.  I wrote a letter to the, to the management about her because she, she was"--she did in New York [New York] once, 'The Rite of Spring,' which is very difficult work by Igor Stravinsky, and she--the conductor was Igor (unclear)--he's long dead, too.  But he, he wouldn't take a bow, a bow by himself.  He would always ask the percussionist to stand up with him because she's the kind of very big part and very difficult.  And he would never take a solo bow without her.  And she was that good.  She, she--and then later on, the story was she, she was--San Francisco has a very famous opera company [San Francisco Opera].  And she was, she quit the orchestra and got with the ballet.  And I'm sure she's not there now because she's older than me.
Speaker 2: (DOLORES WHITE):  No, she retired a long time ago.  Well, no, no, it was that she kicked out or something.
Speaker 1: Not out of the ballet orchestra, she was kicked out of the orchestra, San Francisco.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And I--that's the end of that story.  What I was in--when I went to New York, I stayed only for about--two years, no, no, about year and--not even a year.
Story_ID: 244011
Speaker 1: --And so I was studying with a very famous cellist in New York [New York], Luigi Silva, he was Italian.  And he was born in Italy.  He was very good looking and very, very--you could--he used to play violin parts on the cello and all that.  And he liked me very much, and I'd (unclear), he went to the--I would go to his house and take lessons, and he would, his wife was very jealous of him.  And she would--and they would curse each other out in Italian (unclear)--hear all that and everything, but he was a very good--anywhere he--I studied with him for a while, and he, he arranged to have me go to Hartford, Connecticut and try out for a scholarship in, in Hartford.  I went up and I auditioned, and I got the scholarship.  And I was assistant principal cellist of the Chi--of the Hartford Symphony [Orchestra].  And so I stayed in the Hartford Symphony for a while, and I studied--I, I went to New York.  I was, I knew [HistoryMaker] Dolores [White], and I was going out in New York and what not.  And we'd dress bohemian and take in the Budapest String Quartet at George--Washington Irving High School [New York, New York] and everything.  And we had a good, great, great time.  So to make a long story short, I was--we had gotten married that summer, and we were in Chicago [Illinois].  And Little Rock [integration of Central High School, Little Rock, Arkansas] was going on, and I had, I, I was studying, took about three or four lessons from [Leonard] Rose at that time because he had been--the conductor--the head of the school in Hartford, he was, he was a, he's a very, very dynamic guy and he knew a lot of musicians that were very (unclear).  And he got Rose to come up there and play.  And so Rose got to know me, and I, so I was--I got to be a friend, and I would joke with him and everything.  And they--I would go down, down to his home in Great Neck, New York, it's a suburban area about--only rich people live in--or famous people like Rose.  Rose was first cellist in this Cleveland Orchestra when he was nineteen with Walter Rasinski [ph.] (unclear) and then Rasinski found a job in New York, and he took the horn player and Rose and a few others with him to New York.  And Rose, Rose was first cellist at the--
Speaker 2: (DOLORES WHITE):  New York.
Speaker 1: New York--he was first cellist at Cleveland first and then he went to--Rasinski went to New York and took theater and Rose was a fantastic cellist, beautiful sound--
Story_ID: 244012
Speaker 1: When I was in Hartford [Connecticut], he [Leonard Rose] came up there and played with us and then when I was, I was on the telephone, when I came back from Chicago [Illinois], and I told him I wanted to study with him for a few, few times before he went on his concert tour.  It was in the fall and so [HistoryMaker] Dolores [White] kept telling me to ask him if there are any openings in major orchestras.  And so I saved it to the last--I kept telling (unclear) quiet.  I said, "Come on, I don't, that's--I'm not thinking about that.  I'm just thinking about, I'm in Hartford.  And it's pretty good.  I'm assistant principal [for Hartford Symphony Orchestra]," and I was making a lot of money, and I was assistant--I was a cellist in the quartet.  And I, I'd had enough of that, and so anyway, I saved it to the last, and I said, "Mr. Rose, if there's, if--my wife keeps bugging me in the background, says, if there're any openings in any major orchestras?"  And so I said--he said, you--right away, he said, "Well, there's one in Cleveland [Ohio], but you never mentioned it."  I said, "Oh, I'm not, I don't know about (unclear) not my idea."  And then he said, "Well, if you want me to speak to Mr. Szell," oh, Mr.--Szell's name was magic in the music world, and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, and what was his first name?
Speaker 1: George Szell.
Speaker 2: George Szell, okay.
Speaker 1: And he said, "You want me to mention it to him?"  And he says, he mentioned it to him, and Szell immediately was interested.  It was, in Little Rock [Arkansas], everything was going on.  And Szell had a lot of feelings about that sort of thing.  He was a great admirer of Adlai Stevenson.  And then he was, he was--when the kids were killed at Kent State [University, Kent, Ohio]--and it happened later, but I found out that he had the orchestra stand in silence for a week before every concert.  So we had to stand up, a minute of silence.  And so anyway, Szell heard--he approached Szell about me, and so he said, he told, he gave Szell my phone number.  He got it from me.  He said, and Szell called me directly and asked me if I could come tomorrow.  And I said I'd rather have time to practice for a few days (laughter).  So he, we arranged it for three days or something like that.  And I was working for Moshe Paranov in Hartford.  And he was--I was supposed to--I was assistant principal, and I was--I had duties and with the section and everything.  I didn't say anything.  I went back and went to play cello and went down to New York [New York].  And I went down there early in the morning and (unclear) one Steinway [Hall, New York, New York] building which had a lot of practice rooms.  It was open, and I went to--I took studies in (unclear) and everything, and then I took a cab around to Park Avenue [New York, New York] where Szell was staying.  And I took--I took the elevator to the eleventh floor and Szell opened the door and there was, stood George Szell himself, says, "Hello".  (Laughter) I said, "How do you," (laughter), whatever (unclear) and I said I went back.  And he said, "Do you have anything to put your cello in?"  I said, "No," I said, I said, I figured he made enough money that he could buy another bath mat or something.  And I was worried about the audition.
Story_ID: 244013
Speaker 1: Anyway, I went, I took the audition, and he [George Szell] asked me all the things that were most cellists had to go through in auditioning.  And he was tough.  And half way between the audition and when it was over, he was asking me questions and, oh what kind of cello did I have, where did I get my experience and all that.  And so then it was--it went on for the audition.  And then the audition was over with, and he said, "Thank you very much.  We'll let you know."  That was it.  So I, I had so many auditions like that where the conductor (unclear) from the Midwest and New York [New York], everywhere.  And so I said, well, that's the end of that.  And so that was about--I went back to Hartford [Connecticut], but I didn't tell [Moshe] Paranov anything.  I just said I was sick or something, and forgot about it.  And so, and I--about three or four days later, I got a telegram from the Cleveland Orchestra [Musical Arts] Association, said that I'd been hired.  I still, I get tears in my eyes when I think about it.  I get tears in my eyes that I, I had been hired as the Cleveland Orchestra's cellist, but that time, the Cleveland Orchestra had gone on a tour of Europe before.  This was the fall, but in spring, they went to Europe, and they were, they were world's famous orchestra.  They were, you've read about it when they were, they were fantastic and everything.  And so I, I went back and with the fellow that I worked for in Hartford, Connecticut, he always made me remember that he, he had done me a favor because a lot of guys in his position wouldn't hire, wouldn't think of hiring a Negro.  And he, he threw that up to me, and I didn't like it, but I didn't say anything.  And so, but, and so when I went back, I told him, I told him the day that I was out from the orchestra rehearsal and everything is that I went down to Cleveland [Ohio]--down to New York, and auditioned for Cleveland Orchestra.  And I said, this morning I got it, yesterday, and I was sitting in his office in the morning.  I said, and I got a wire from the Cleveland Orchestra (unclear) and said that I had been hired, and you should have seen his face.  He was, he was--he smoked a pipe, no, a cigar, pipe.  And he, he lit the cigar about five times--pipe about four or five times.  And he said he couldn't, he couldn't believe it.  He said, he was, he would talk about George Szell in the Cleveland Orchestra.  It was, every year the Cleveland Orchestra would go to Hartford on southern--on the eastern tour, and he said, George Szell, the (unclear) the Cleveland Orchestra.  And I was in, and he, he was dumbfounded.  He was, he said, finally, he said, asked me questions and everything.  And I said, "Well, yeah, I'm going to leave in a few days."  And we lived in a low-rent apartment on the edge of town, and I, I didn't have a car.  I told you that.  I didn't--I couldn't drive.  And so I got, I got that session with George, with Paranov was over, and I was going to work in the morning and I said, with my friend, and I said, I won't be riding with you much longer because I got a job in the Cleveland Orchestra.  And he put on the brakes.  And he says, "My God, you're going to be in the same orchestra with Marc Lifschey," and didn't say anything about Szell.  But Mark Lifschey was a fantastic oboist.
Story_ID: 237785
Speaker 1: At the end of our last segment, you were telling us about your audition with George Szell, and your being hired by the Cleveland Orchestra--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --in 1957.  So in Little Rock [Arkansas], they're trying to desegregate the schools in Arkansas.  And in Cleveland [Ohio] in 1957, you're desegregating the Cleveland Orchestra.  How'd that make you feel?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, that made me feel very good.  I felt--I--there's no words to describe how I felt.  Shall I go on?
Speaker 1: Oh, sure.
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, when the orchestra signed a petition that they--most of the orchestra signed it, and George Szell's name was first, and they would--now, when we got in Birmingham [Alabama], I had to say it was in the segregating days.  And so I, I didn't stay in the hotel.  I stayed in the [A.G.] Gaston Motel [Birmingham, Alabama].  [A.G.] Gaston's a big businessman in Birmingham.  And we--it was a very nice motel, and I didn't have the cello because my cello would go in a traveling trunk, and with, with the rest of the instruments.  So when I showed up at the door of, of the Municipal Auditorium [Boutwell Memorial Auditorium, Birmingham, Alabama], I didn't have the cello.  I didn't have anything. I just had me.  And so a big redneck was on the door, and he said, "Where y'all going?"  I said, "I'm with the orchestra," and kept walking.  And so then he went upstairs to settle it because there was a law in Birmingham that no orchestra or anything integrated could play in the Municipal Auditorium.  And so the house was sold out for months.  The orchestra in those days brought that kind of audience to, to the hall.  And then the orchestra--and so they settled that right away.  And so I, when they told me that it had been settled, I got out on stage early so I could be seen, and warmed up and everything.  And so after the concert was over, a white fellow with his daughter showed up and said, "[HistoryMaker] Mr. [Donald] White, I want to tell you how we enjoyed the concert, and my daughter would like your autograph."  (Laughter)  And another thing--
Speaker 1: (DOLORES WHITE):  He had another inci--he had incidences in New York City [New York, New York].
Speaker 2: Yeah, the New York City--
Speaker 1: (DOLORES WHITE):  On the railroad--
Speaker 2: --a Negro woman brought her class down from Harlem [New York, New York], forty or fifty, a bunch kids.  And they said, "This is Mr. White.  He's been in the orchestra.  He's, the first Negro"--
Speaker 1: You want to stop for a minute or keep going?
Speaker 2: --No, no I'll finish.  But that woman brought the whole high school class down to meet me.  There are a lot of things happened like that, that I just think of a few things that I--
Speaker 1: (DOLORES WHITE):  You have a handkerchief?
Speaker 2: That's all.  I, I--
Speaker 1: (DOLORES WHITE):  (Unclear) A lot of times when the orchestra traveled, and they'd see him, and they'd say, "No," or "where are you going?"  It's even happened in New York City.
Story_ID: 237786
Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] Mr. [Donald] White, you shared with us already some, some of your fond memories of being accepted into the world-class Cleveland Symphony Orchestra [sic. Cleveland Orchestra] and winning the acceptance also of your peers in the orchestra, but struggling still against segregation, not just in the South, in Birmingham, Alabama, but also sometimes having strange receptions or unpleasant experiences in the North.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: How long did that go on after 1957, after you become a member of the Cleveland Orchestra?
Speaker 2: Well, not so much--I, I got looked at, you know, that sort of thing.  But they didn't, they didn't--it was no overt feeling.  They didn't say anything.  One girl in the South was--they called me a "nig," and she was a white girl, and I went in a place to eat, and they accepted me.  But she said, "It's the first time I've ever waited on a nig in Birmingham--out in this city," in Chicago [Illinois]--in Birmingham--no, it was in the South.  And things like that.  There was a, there was harpist in the orchestra that was from Birmingham, and she wouldn't speak to me for years and everything.  And when we went to Birmingham, went to--up in New York State to help out in the orchestra, and then a bunch of us went.  And then she was in the same car, and she never said anything.  You know what happened to her?  She was, one of her prize pupils was a Negro, and she's been in the Boston Symphony [Orchestra] for I don't--it's--I've been in the orchestra for, from '57 [1957] to '95 [1995], and she got in the orchestra, in the--in the Boston Symphony about ten years or fifteen years later.  And when I said, when that happens, the girl in, the Birmingham girl, (unclear) an old woman--she's still living, she, she, "Oh, Don, I got a nice card from Annie [ph.] today."  And so everything, she was so nice and so, because her prize pupil was Anne, Anne--I forgot her last name.  It was Anne, a Negro, and she said--I said, "See that, how things work out," you know.  There are many things like that happened to me.  I had to--I can't think of everything now.
Story_ID: 237787
Speaker 1: Do you feel in 1957 that you were a history maker, did you realize at that point in time how significant it was that you were the first African American to be accepted into the Cleveland Orchestra?
Speaker 2: Not too much because I was worried about staying there, playing and being competent because the Cleveland Orchestra is, is a big, big accomplishment.  That's for anybody that's in there.  And [George] Szell was very nice to me.  He wasn't always nice, but he--when I first got in the orchestra, he was, he--once I was out checking out on bowing (unclear) and all that kind of thing, and he passed and just put his hand quietly on my, on my shoulder and went on, you know.  And then he said, he--I told you about the Kent State [University, Kent, Ohio] (unclear) he mentioned.  And he was a martinet about the orchestra and he didn't take anything from the orchestra.  But he was, on the other hand, a liberal.  He was, he knew about Little Rock [Arkansas].  He knew about the riots at Kent State, and everything, and he was very much in sympathy about what is, what was happening.  He would be very put out about [President George Walker] Bush, you know, and all of that mess that's going on now, you know.  It's, it's too bad that Bush--let me say a few words about Bush.
Speaker 1: Oh, go right ahead.
Speaker 2: He said that, he's a moron and he's, he's, he's got the--he's found God, and he--and all of that's phony.  He's--he went into Vietnam War [sic. Iraq War] and saying that it was Saddam Hussein.  They've relinquished all of that now.  They've said, just this week, they said that there were no more weapons in Vietnam [sic. Iraq] and there never was.
Speaker 1: In Iraq, yes.
Speaker 2: Iraq, and they, and then he said, and all of those lives that are lost, and the Vietnamese [sic. Iraqis], everyday they're getting murdered every day because they don't want, they want--don't want Americans there.
Speaker 1: Oh, for the Iraqis, yes.  Well, a lot of people are saying it's another Vietnam.  So I understand that.
Speaker 2: Yeah, sure is.  I, I--it makes me sick, and it makes me very sick to--the U.S. soldiers that are being killed and twice as--three times as many are being wounded for life without arms, legs and everything.  And he has the nerve to joke about things, Bush.  He's a--I think he's the worst man in the world.
Story_ID: 237788
Speaker 1: How long were you the only African American in the [Cleveland] Orchestra?
Speaker 2: Well, Ralph Curry is the other cellist who was there.  And he's been--it's about, it's about twenty years ago that he was in, he was let in the orchestra.  And he--
Speaker 1: So you came in '57 [1957], and he came about twenty years after you started?
Speaker 2: Yeah, twenty years from now.  About twenty--
Speaker 1: (DOLORES WHITE):  He got his twenty-five-year watch, so--
Speaker 2: Yeah, twenty-five years, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, so '79 [1979] or '80 [1980], Ralph Curry came to the Cleveland Orchestra [in 1978]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So you were there a long time as the one and only.
Speaker 2: Yeah, once Ralph was, was the last stand when he got in the orchestra.  And there was an absence, and he was supposed to move up with me, and he didn't move up.  So I caught him after, at intermission, and I said, "Let's not have it me and you.  Let's not me and you have it."  I mean he looked funny and he didn't say anything.
Story_ID: 237789
Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] Mr. [Donald] White, during that twenty-year period where you were the only African American member of the Cleveland Orchestra, I know there were a lot of school children--and I include myself in that group, really inspired by the fact that you were up there.  And we came to Severance Hall [Cleveland, Ohio] and we didn't see anybody except you.  But I wonder, were you able at all to work with groups of school children to--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: --try and increase their involvement in classical music?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, I went to every school, every--for months and weeks, years, after I had been in the orchestra.  I would go around to black schools and play and talk about it.  I did all I could to do, make (unclear).  I think that what's happened now, there's a lot of rock and roll people in, in junior age now.  And they, they--there's a lot of money they can make, and if they dress up in funny clothes and everything and act silly.  And they can, they can do a lot of (unclear), but there's a lot, there's a lot of musicians--there's a black organization called Sphinx [Organization, Detroit, Michigan].  And it's a very--it's organized in Michigan, in Michigan.  I went up as a judge three or four years ago.  And it's, it's only open to black musicians and Hispanic musicians who feel that they are ready.  And they're giving recitals here in Carnegie Hall [New York, New York].  And they're--I went up to meet the guy.  I thought that he was white.  And I was, I was in the plane station looking for a white man, and he said, "Are you Donald White?"  And he said, "Oh, yeah," (laughter).  He was, he was a Negro.  He, he majored in violin at Cleveland State [University, Cleveland, Ohio].
Speaker 1: (DOLORES WHITE):  No, not at Cleveland--
Speaker 2: No, at Michigan State [University, East Lansing, Michigan].  Where is the big school (unclear)--
Speaker 1: But there's an organization, professional organization of African American musicians?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Is that part of their mission to increase the involvement (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --of minorities--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --in the classical music field?  Okay.
Speaker 2: Oh they're--they worked up to giving--playing in Carnegie Hall.
Story_ID: 237790
Speaker 1: Now, [HistoryMaker] Mr. [Donald] White, I would be remiss if I didn't talk about some of the other members of your family who are also involved in classical music, including your wife [HistoryMaker] Dolores [White], whose name you mentioned earlier because she was with you in New York [New York] when you were continuing to hone your skills as a musician.  But can you tell me, are there other members of the White family, again, also involved in music?
Speaker 2: My boy, he plays, he played violin.  He was with the Boston Pops [Orchestra] for three years.  Didn't she mention it?
Speaker 1: I think Professor White did mention your son's name in her interview, but this is your interview.  (Laughter) So I'd like to, to know also about your involvement in your son's life as far as the music is concerned?
Speaker 2: Yeah, ah, yeah.  He--I took Darrow [White], I took him to the concerts, and he was, he was very--he was very much a--he practiced all the time.  He gave, played the violin (unclear) [Pyotr Ilyich] Tchaikovsky's concerto at (unclear) recital.  And he, really he was--one of his big accomplishments before he was, he had an arm (unclear), but he can't play anymore.  But he went to, went with the Boston Pops, with coast-to-coast tour with John, John (unclear).
Speaker 1: John Williams.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Oh, Boston Pops, yes, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he went with them.
Speaker 1: And that was your son, Darrow White, the violinist?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, and how about your daughter, Diana [White-Gould]?
Speaker 2: Ah, she's in the Cleveland Orchestra Chorus, Children's Chorus for ten years, and the conductor, her (unclear) says that she wouldn't think of taking a bow without Diana.  Diana, whenever she has a special bow, she asks Diana to stand, and she lives, ah, she's fantastic.  We--they have a manager of the orchestra now that any time that I want to go or Dolores wants to go, we just tell her to tell the manager.  And he says, "Tickets are at the box office," (laughter).
Speaker 1: So you said, Diana White-Gould--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --has been accompanying the children's--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --chorus of the orchestra--
Speaker 2: Yeah, for ten years.
Speaker 1: --Cleveland Orchestra.  Okay.

Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] Mr. [Donald] White, you were with the Cleveland Orchestra from 1957 until what year?
Speaker 2: Ninety--'95 [1995].
Speaker 1: Nineteen ninety-five [1995].
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what was that like, retiring from the orchestra after so many years?
Speaker 2: Well, it was, it was sentimental that I felt.  A lot of friends I'd made in the orchestra.  And they're a lot of the friends I still see or see at the hall [Severance Hall, Cleveland, Ohio] or at concerts and that kind of thing.  But it's--I knew that I was getting, I was getting over the hill (laughter).  Orchestra playing is not something that stays forever.  It's, it's--you reach a peak, and then you go down.  I know that as well as anybody.
Speaker 1: Right.  So did you have a big retirement party?
Speaker 2: We had a big party over at the hall, at the hall.  And (unclear), and I've got pictures of the party and everything and everybody got a chance to--every retiree got a chance to talk about his feelings and all that.
Story_ID: 237792
Speaker 1: And I understand, [HistoryMaker] Mr. [Donald] White, that while you were playing with the Cleveland Symphony Orchestra [sic. Cleveland Orchestra], you also had some opportunities to teach?
Speaker 2: Oh, I, see, I taught at Cleveland State [sic. The Music Settlement, Cleveland, Ohio].  I went down to [College of] Wooster [Wooster, Ohio] and I, I taught everybody--taught everywhere in Cleveland and outside of Cleveland.  Cleveland State, I mean at Wooster music school [Department of Music] (unclear), and some of everywhere.
Speaker 1: Did you teach at the Cleveland Institute of Music [Cleveland, Ohio] also?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: No, you didn't teach there.  But a lot of local institutions here?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Mr. White, I wonder, after you retired from playing with the orchestra, did you continue to teach or--
Speaker 2: I did for a while.
Speaker 1: After '95 [1995]?
Speaker 2: For a little while, but I didn't--I had diabetes, and it's--I suffer from it now.  I have to watch myself.  A friend of ours, just died three days ago, and he was a singer in Sweden in twenty-five years.  And he's--and I'll miss him very much because he was a man that had a lot of sympathy for racial discrimination and everything.  And the reason why I went to Sweden and he was--he had a party three days before he got sick.  And he went to the oyster club, gave him a party, and he said he felt funny, had too much salt and everything.  And he had a stroke one night.  And then he had another stroke, and that was it.
Speaker 1: And what was your friend's name?
Speaker 2: John--
Speaker 1: Was that John Fleming?
Speaker 2: John Fleming.
Speaker 1: Okay, also a great musician.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah, but we--he didn't drive, and we lived just a few blocks from him, and for years I used to pick him up and go eat somewhere at different places and everything.  And he was a, he was a man of, of tremendous words.  He, he knew how to talk, and he had, he had a big speaker's voice, and he was very, he was very, very--he was--everybody liked him because he was a man that--he carried himself very well, and he had a lot of stories.  Some of them were, true, and some of 'em are made up (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, a great storyteller.
Speaker 2: Yeah (laughter).
Speaker 1: Mr. Fleming, opera singer--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --Mr. John Fleming.  Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, sure.
Speaker 1: I think I know a little bit about his history.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he lived three doors from us.  He was, he was a great man.  He was one year older than--a year and a half older than I am.  So I'd better watch myself (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 237793
Speaker 1: When people are asked, what will they say that your legacy is?
Speaker 2: I hope they'll say that I made it possible for a lot of Negroes, not only in the Cleveland Orchestra, but otherwise, of getting in orchestras or anything else that is, that is conducive to that kind of accomplishment.  A lot of people don't realize what playing in a symphony orchestra is.  But a lot of 'em do.  And they really think that there's--the people we associate with in town do realize that very thing that people that are not musicians that realize what music, what real music means.  And that's, that's, to me, the greatest thing.  I think that, I think, I--a lot of people--I see people now on the street or something and they know me, "Hi, how are you?  I remember you from the"--and that gives me a great feeling of satisfaction.  A lot of people that I don't know will say, "Hello, how are you?  I knew--you don't know me, but I know you" and this kind of thing.  And that's a great gratification.  That's more than money.  It's, it's more than what people think of you, and they do, and I'd see that every, almost every day if I go out.
Story_ID: 237794
Speaker 1: Okay, [HistoryMaker] Mr. [Donald] White, would you tell us about this picture that's on the screen?
Speaker 2: That was taken when I was in the [Cleveland] Orchestra (laughter).
Speaker 1: And would you say that's maybe late (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) About five to six years after I'd been the orchestra.
Speaker 1: So maybe early 1960s?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Great, next.
Speaker 2: That's on the return trip from Russia [Soviet Union].  That was in 1965.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I have a raincoat on, and I bought in, on the tour.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Okay, next.
Speaker 1: Wow, yeah, that's--he's dead--the one in the middle, he's dead now.
Speaker 2: Do you remember his name?
Speaker 1: Lenny Samuels [Leonard Samuels].  And I'm pointing to him and joking, you know, but I'm pointing to him.
Speaker 2: Was he also a musician?
Speaker 1: Yeah, he was a very good musician.  He got, he got in the same year I got in, mid-1957.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  And what year do you think this would have been taken, approximately?
Speaker 1: My hair is black (laughter).
Speaker 2: (DOLORES WHITE):  Some gray there.
Speaker 1: Between '55 [1955] and '60 [1960].
Speaker 2: (DOLORES WHITE):  Oh, no, I think a little later than that.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  I'm thinking mid-'70s [1970s].
Speaker 2: (DOLORES WHITE):  Yeah, that's definitely right.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Okay, all right, next.
Speaker 2: (DOLORES WHITE):  He was famous for his beards.  He was in the orchestra.  He was the only one that was really allowed to have--
Speaker 1: That's my graduation picture.
Speaker 2: (DOLORES WHITE):  Retirement picture.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Oh, [HistoryMaker] Mrs. [Dolores] White, you can--your mic is on too, right?
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Yes.
Speaker 2: So both of you can narrate.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Yeah, you can add your comment.  Now, you can say anything.
Speaker 2: (DOLORES WHITE):  Okay.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  This is a little different process, but please feel free to--
Speaker 2: (DOLORES WHITE):  Oh, okay.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  --to embellish.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA DISCUSSION) (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  So this is your retirement, sir?
Speaker 1: Yeah, this is--

Speaker 1: Retirement party at Blossom [Music Center, Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio].
Speaker 2: Can you just say what Blossom is?
Speaker 1: (DOLORES WHITE):  Blossom Music Center.
Speaker 2: Now, is that the summer home for the orchestra?
Speaker 1: (DOLORES WHITE):  Yeah, that's the summer home for the orchestra.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: (DOLORES WHITE):  And I think it started in--it seems to me it was in the '60s [1960s], early '60s [1960s], but it could have been the '70s [1970s].  But it was the summer home, the orchestra, and they played about five to six weeks or regular serious concerts.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  And then if we could identify who's in the photo, from left to right, viewer's left to right.

Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Perfect, next.  Thank you.  Go ahead.
Speaker 1: Where I got, at Eastman School of Music [University of Rochester, Rochester, New York], I got a plaque for playing in the orchestra.  I'd just retired.
Speaker 2: (DOLORES WHITE):  He and (unclear)--he was being recognized for having played in the orchestra for thirty-eight years and so he got a plaque at the Eastman School of Music.  That's the president of the school, of the Eastman School of Music.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Okay, next.
Speaker 2: That's me and who else?
Speaker 1: (DOLORES WHITE):  That's at a retirement party.  I mean that's Donald's retirement party, and that's his son on the left, is Darrow White and--

Speaker 2: That's my sister and her husband and me.
Speaker 1: (DOLORES WHITE):  His sister, Mildred [ph.], who lives in San Jose, California, and her husband, James Higgins [ph.].  So it's Mildred and James Higgins and Donald White, and it was taken about five years ago.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Great, thank you.  Next.
Speaker 1: Don't you have to have it right side up?
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  We rotate it later.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: (DOLORES WHITE):  Well, we were at the beach (laughter), and I believe, I want to say that was in Puerto Rico because we are not great swimmers, but we're great (laughter) bench people (laughter), and so we were--we had our chair, and we were enjoying the outside.
Speaker 1: You know about when that was?
Speaker 2: (DOLORES WHITE):  Probably about 1998, like that, '98 [1998].
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Great, next.
Speaker 2: That's Darrow and Diana.
Speaker 1: (DOLORES WHITE):  That's our two children, Diana, Diana Rose White-Gould and who is a very fine pianist and educator, and our son, Darrow White, who is a violinist, and an educator also, very fine--
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  About what (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (DOLORES WHITE):  (Simultaneous) That was about, about three years ago.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Okay, next.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: (DOLORES WHITE):  That's a picture of me and several of the participants in a conference that I went to that was sponsored by the, the Black Music Research Center [sic. Center for Black Music Research, Columbia College Chicago] in Chicago [Illinois] and also the American Society of Musicians and Composers [sic. American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers].  That was in Trinidad so that was Trinidad and it was outside a church.  And we wanted to--
Speaker 1: Telephone.
Speaker 2: (DOLORES WHITE):  --experience an African church ritual, so we went there.  And they make you wear these hats.
Speaker 1: (DOLORES WHITE):  This is a picture of Dolores White (laughter), and I was at the piano, and I was--that was actually taken in, in Room 106 or so at Cuyahoga Community College [Cleveland, Ohio].  And I was in front of the grand piano there.  It was actually in one of the classrooms, but in that room, we had a piano in there.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Date?
Speaker 1: (DOLORES WHITE):  It was probably in the '90s [1990s], 1990, 1991, something like that.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Great, next.
Speaker 1: (DOLORES WHITE):  That's also a picture that--most faculty have to have their pictures taken--or they used to have it taken.  And that was probably in the '80s [1980s], about 1988 or so.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Okay, next.
Speaker 1: Oh, why did they (unclear), (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (DOLORES WHITE):  (Simultaneous) Oh, that is (laughter), that's a picture of me playing the Congo drum.  And that was in Cuba, and actually, this picture was taken probably in the--1993 or something like that, in Cuba.  And that was taken in Havana, Cuba.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Okay, that's good, next.  Go ahead.
Speaker 2: (DOLORES WHITE):  This is a picture of the family (laughter), minus my daughter.  This is a picture of me on the left and--Dolores White--and my husband's in the center, Donald White, and my son is on the right.  He had come home either from school.  So this picture probably dates back to the early 1990s.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Next.
Speaker 2: This has a copyright of '84 [1984] for the orchestra.
Speaker 1: (DOLORES WHITE):  Do you want talk to that?
Speaker 2: This is Donald White, taken about, what is it?
Speaker 1: (DOLORES WHITE):  She said it was--
Speaker 2: It's '84 [1984].
Speaker 1: In '84 [1984].
Speaker 2: (DOLORES WHITE):  The Fanfare book ['Fanfare: Portraits of the Cleveland Orchestra'], I think this was the first Fanfare book that came out, and, you know, something to display the orchestra members and give a little history of each orchestra member besides putting their picture up on the lower level of the Severance Hall [Cleveland, Ohio].  But, and it really promotes the orchestra also and promotes the members of the orchestra.  So the artistry is fine with the picture of the cello there and on the other side is Donald's cello partner, Harvey Wolfe, and so, so we were very proud of that picture when it first came out so that we really had something that we could take around and say, "Oh, yes (laughter), here's our picture."
