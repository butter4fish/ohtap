Story_ID: 361078
Speaker 1: Okay, so we're gonna start the interview by talking about your family tree.  You can remember your grandparents on both sides?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, well let's start with your father [Sam Cole, Jr.].  Tell me your grandparents' names, your grandfather.
Speaker 2: My, my grandfather name was--is Sam Cole, Sr., and he was from a part of Mississippi if I'm not mistaken.  And I remember we would visit him a lot and being around him and they, they owned a lot of property in Terry, Arkansas, and actually, my work is based on something that he, he talked to me about, so I'll get in--I'll get into that part later.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.  Well, are there any stories that you can share about the times that you spent with your grandfather?  Did you, you visit him in Mississippi or in (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)  No.
Speaker 1: --Arkansas?
Speaker 2: No.  I visited, visited him in Arkansas.  They were from--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --parts of Mississippi and I would go down and they owned a lot of property and they would raise soybeans and corn and things of that nature.  And just talking to him, he was a--he was a very wise man, very I, I wouldn't say angry, but I always talked about the part of being black, and what it was like to be black.  Those are the things that I remember about, about, about him, him the most in stories that he would tell.  And if I may go and proceed, my work always had been about a story he told me about.  When I graduated from high school [Pine Bluff High School, Pine Bluff, Arkansas], I didn't want to go register to vote, and I remember coming down to him and registration was coming up, and I was getting ready to graduate, and he was--he was about, about ninety-one years old, so he kneeled down in the sand and he told me--he kneeled down with his cane, and drew in the sand and told me, "Go stand beside this tree".  I'm like, "I don't know why I'm doing this."  I did that and I came back and I told him I--and when I went there, I had this really scary feeling.  He said, "You know what?  You don't wanna vote but African Americans, they were lynched by their neck ties on their way to vote."  It, it, it just stayed on my mind.  I mean, I remember the feeling that I had.  And so his story became a major part of my work.  I didn't know until later how, how important it was.
Speaker 1: Say, say the phrase the again that he--
Speaker 2: He said, "You know," he told me go stand beside this tree--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --and I did that.  And when I came back, I see--he asked me, "How did it feel?" I, I said, "Granddad, it had this real scary feeling."  He said, "You know what?  You don't wanna vote, but African Americans, they were lynched by their neck ties, on their way to vote.  This is why it's so important for you to go register to vote."
Speaker 1: I gotcha.
Speaker 2: And ever since then, it's been a part of my repertoire--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --to make sure that I, I did that and make sure that I, I inform others of the--of that.
Speaker 1: Did he share any stories about his growing up?
Speaker 2: He always talked about the idea of his, his growing up and how, how, how they didn't have much and how, you know, the property that he gained, it was for the family, and it was unusual for a--for a black family to have any property, and, you know, being sharecroppers.  And, you know, he talked about the idea of, you know, soybean, that's what his main thing was.  He was raising corn for us and he always made sure every harvest that's, that's what he did.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Did he talk to you how he acquired the money to buy the property or who he bought it from?  Were there any--
Speaker 2: It was--
Speaker 1: --slaves?
Speaker 2: --passed down to him.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was passed down to him.
Speaker 1: From his, his, his parents.
Speaker 2: His parents, right.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Was there any talk about any of his parents or grandparents being slaves?
Speaker 2: We--well, he would--briefly, he talked about his grandparents being slaves and, and how they migrated to Arkansas, and he always talked about the idea of being close to Star City, Arkansas, which had a lot of--had a lot of what I, may want to say is a lot of Ku Klux Klan [KKK] involvement there and the hangings that, that went on in Star City, Arkansas.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: And I grew up knowing, don't go to Star City, Arkansas.  And there were signs, I remember playing in football when I was in the eighth grade that said the N word, don't let the sun catch you.  I, I, I remember all of that.
Speaker 1: Wow.  Okay.  Well, were there any other stories you wanna share about your grandfather?
Speaker 2: Well, that--that's basically it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 361079
Speaker 1: What about your grandmother on your father's side?
Speaker 2: She was--she was a real, you know, proud woman, a real calm and--
Speaker 1: What was her name?
Speaker 2: Mable Cole.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I mean, she was--she was real--I mean, she was always nurturing and, and things of--things of that nature.  I mean, she was always, always there for us.  Matter of fact, she stayed, stayed with us even when she got ill and we, we brought her up and she stayed there with us.
Speaker 1: How much education did your grandparents have?
Speaker 2: Very little education.  Everything they learned, I remember my granddaddy [Sam Cole, Sr.] was talking about how much he--he was--he was big on education, but he was also big thing about once you got sixteen, you need to be a man, go to the [U.S.] military or do something of that--of, of that nature.  I remember that part.  It was very important to him, was about being a man.  And the thing about, you know, working, you know, you work hard, and getting up early, and that's the thing I carry from him and my dad.  My friends used to always tease me, they--I would say, well, you know, you--you're like the [U.S.] Army.  You get everything done before nine o'clock (laughter), and I'm up early.  I'm up early.  I constantly work and I'm drinking a coffee, I'm getting things done because that was instilled in me.  You know, you gotta get up and, and work, and take care of business.
Story_ID: 361080
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay, so let's talk about your father.  What was his name?
Speaker 2: His name was Sam Cole, Jr.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And do you know his date of birth?
Speaker 2: May 4th, I wanna say 1926 or '27 [1927].
Speaker 1: Okay.  And tell me about your father.
Speaker 2: My father had a number of jobs.  He, he went to the [U.S.] military.  He went to the [U.S.] Army and, and the--and the [U.S.] Navy.  The thing I remember about him the most and he's, he's still around, is that he was a real hard worker.  He was always--you know, he was--you know, he was always one of those men growing up in the, what the '40s [1940s] and the '50s [1950s], and '60s [1960s] that was--that didn't like the way society was actually treating him, as a man.  And one thing that stood off in my mind that I remember, that bothered me a lot and I had a chance to talk to him about in, in 2004, was he works for--he was--he was working at this gas station and I remember my mom [Jessie McGlounce Cole] would come pick him up and my sister and I would go with her.  And this guy asked him to check the oil and, and fill--and fill the gas tank up.  Well, my dad evidently forgot to check the oil and I'll never forget, the, the guy said to him, he was white, "N, I, I told you to check the oil, too," and threw the money on the ground right by my door.  And my dad just stood there.  He didn't--and my mom saw what was going on, so she called my name and I turned away.  That's when my dad, he, he picked up the money and took it back in, and I'll never forget that.  And in 2004, I asked him about, you know--that's what stayed in my mind.  I mean, like, "Why didn't you do something?"  And we talked about it, you know, at that time, you couldn't do nothing.  I mean, you couldn't say anything either.  He'd say, you know-"You know," he'd say, "that hurt me the most for you to see that," and that was the thing that I, I--that really went through, that I was like, "Wow, you know, dad," you know.  I--and I always wanted to ask him that but we never had a chance to talk about it.  That was one of the things that stayed in my mind the most.  And, you know, I, I mean he was--he was--I mean, he was there (unclear) at the time.  And I never knew what it was like growing up as a black man, he would always say, "You know what, when you get older, you'll learn," and I was like, "Wow."
Story_ID: 361081
Speaker 1: Well, were there any lessons that were taught to you by him [Cole's father, Sam Cole, Jr.] about--
Speaker 2: Oh, oh yeah.
Speaker 1: --about--
Speaker 2: I mean--I mean, that was the work ethics.  He was always working.  And, and the thing about it, okay, the thing is, if you were fixing a car and you knew you had these certain tools that was there, I, I should have the wrench getting ready to pass to him because I know he, he, he was gonna need the wrench, okay?  And, and his whole thing was--his whole thing about, you know, you get up and you work.  Everybody in my house works.  And his whole thing was, okay, "What are--what are you going to do today?  Your brother's [James Cole] outside cutting the--cutting the lawn" or "Your sister is in there helping, helping your mother [Jessie McGlounce Cole] do the laundry, so what you gonna do today?  How are you gonna contribute today or what are you gonna do?"  Oh, it's about work (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, what about education for your dad?
Speaker 2: He--my dad--my dad went to--he did have a chance to take course at--courses at University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff [Arkansas Agricultural, Mechanical and Normal College; University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff, Pine Bluff, Arkansas], where I did my undergrad after the [U.S.] military, so he did get a chance to--I mean, he, he, he did get his GED [General Educational Development] and that was it, and then--but he took courses on the side.
Speaker 1: Did he talk about his time in the [U.S.] Army or the [U.S.] Navy?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he's always talked about it.  And that's something that really was confusing to him, because I'll never forget, when I had to do a report, I was nine years old and I was talking about this--I, I had to interview my dad 'cause he was--he was in World War II [WWII].  The thing that bothered him the most was, he said the white soldiers told Japanese soldiers that black soldiers had tails like dogs.  And he said that they would always fall behind the black soldiers and, and say, "See tail, see tail, see tail."  And he didn't like that at all.  The military, he didn't really like at all.  And he said it, it was a valuable experience because it taught him discipline but it was a terrible experience as well.
Speaker 1: How did he happen to go in the Army and the Navy?
Speaker 2: Well, he--what he did was he reenlisted.  And, you know, the thing about it, you know, my granddad [Sam Cole, Sr.] philosophy was, when you got sixteen, you should be able to do something.  And my granddad later became an advocate for education, but when you became sixteen, there you were.  I mean, you supposed to be a man now, not eighteen.  And my dad--my dad liked school but he was never--my dad was good with his hands, like I think that--I think that my brother [James Cole] and I acquired that from him.  We are good--we, we are good with our hands.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, he came out of say the Army and, you know, at that time he couldn't get a job and felt maybe he needed to go back into the--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --service--
Speaker 1: Exactly.
Speaker 2: --so that he was doing something.
Speaker 1: Something.
Story_ID: 361082
Speaker 1: All right, let's talk about your grandparents on your mother's side.  Tell me about your grandfather.
Speaker 2: My grandfather, he worked--he, he worked in the steel mills of Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 1: What was his name?
Speaker 2: His name was Jessie McGlounce.
Speaker 1: Can you spell that please?
Speaker 2: M-C-G-L-O-U-N-C-E.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And my grandmother name was Mariah McGlounce.  And she owned a--my--they separated or they got divorced when, when my mom [Jessie McGlounce Cole] was young and he went--he went north, she stayed south, and she owned a blues club.
Speaker 1: Your grandmother?
Speaker 2: Grandmother.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: In Birdsong, Arkansas.  [HistoryMaker] B.B. King played there (laughter), Bobby "Blue" Bland, and I remember going to visit her with my mom, was--it was a lot of fun 'cause she--you know, you'll be--you'll be standing in one part of the house and you could hear the music playing and things like that.  And she--you know, she was--that's--that was like her place.  And my granddad, Jessie, he worked--he worked for the steel mill and he would come down every summer or we'd come visit him.  He would--he, he would bring us--he would save his--save coins in this jar.  I forget the game he played, but it was like cool whip [ph.] or something he played at work.  He'd bring us all these coins down and we would divide them, you know.  And his whole thing--I mean, he, he would always pull you aside.  He smoked--and he smoked a pipe, and he was always talking about, you know, how do you be a man, "Don't let nobody put you down."  Don't let nobody tell you what you can't do.  And be--and, and because I stuttered, I think--I mean, my, my grandparents--all my grandparents, they took a liking to me, and they was always saying, "You know, this is what you need to do."  And I remember times with him, he would tell you--tell me, you know, "Take your time, hold your head up.  You know, don't look down.  No matter what somebody say to you, don't look down."  And I remember, the thing he said to me that stood out the most was he was, you know, he asked me a question after I had to scratch my head.  He said, "No, don't never do that."  So I said why, he said, "You know what?  I was told whenever the slave master would ask you a question and you were trying to decide to get a right answer or the wrong answer, you, you would scratch your head," because that was the idea--I mean, that was the concept that they always--but he said, "Never scratch your head, look them in the face and give them a straight answer, whether it's wrong or it's right, but you need to look them in the face."  That's what stayed in my mind about him.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Any other stories about the times at your grandmother's place?
Speaker 2: There, there were a lot of good times 'cause you know you--I mean--and I come from a strong Baptist Christian background and my mom didn't, didn't like that part of it.  But she would always make sure we went to see, see my grandmother.  And later when she closed the club, she came down and to live with us and, you know, she was--and she was just always there.  And, you know, she was--I mean, she was nurturing as the grandmother, proud of her grandkids and, and things of that nature.
Story_ID: 361083
Speaker 1: What trade do you think you, you got from either one of those grandparents?
Speaker 2: My [maternal] grandmother [Mariah McGlounce]--both of them liked to make quilts.  They were--they were good with their hands.  I come from a family that was good with their hands.  And I always liked to make--I mean, I always liked, liked doing things.  And I was always a thinker and my, my granddad, both of them [Jessie McGlounce and Sam Cole, Sr.], they were strong black men and (laughter), I get accused of being too strong at times.  I'm gonna stand on, on what--on what I believe and what I think.  And I'm gonna always try to be passionate about it or try to be--listening to your side, but there's a way that you gotta go at it, and I'm like them in that way.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What education did your grand- those set of grandparents have?
Speaker 2: It wasn't very much.  I mean, I would say--I would say maybe tenth grade at the most.  Because my, my granddad worked in the steel mill, and I was--he was about--he was about that now and my grandmother, it wasn't--it wasn't very much at all for her either.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did they own--your grandmother owned the land [in Birdsong, Arkansas] that she--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: What about your grandfather?  He moved north?
Speaker 2: He moved to--he, he moved to Chicago [Illinois] and he purchased a--he purchased a apartment.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay, well, let's talk about your father [Sam Cole, Jr.], okay?  I'm sorry, we were talking about your, your, your mother, I'm sorry.  Tell me your mother's name.
Speaker 2: Jessie Cole [Jessie McGlounce Cole].
Speaker 1: So, she's named after her dad?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And when was she born?
Speaker 2: She was born April 15th, 1927, if I'm not mistaken.
Speaker 1: So tell me about your, your mother.
Speaker 2: Oh, it's a lot to say about momma, you know, you're there--she, she finished high school with my dad.  Both of them got their GED [General Educational Development] at the same time.  She turned around and she went to, you know, college.  She took courses at, at the college, University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff [Arkansas Agricultural, Mechanical and Normal College; University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff, Pine Bluff, Arkansas].  And she was--she was the cafeteria manager for I wanna say almost, what, at least thirty-some years for Pine Bluff School District.  She was always the backbone in which--my mom, she knew her boys, all right, and she was a very--she was a very good cook, I mean very good cook.  I mean, it's like, you know, people come from miles around.  Matter of fact, I always talk--tell the story that several times when former President Bill Clinton [President William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton] who would come to Arkansas, she would--I mean, she'd cook a roast and the, the thing just melt in your mouth.  They would call her around and she'd cook for people from all over the--all over the country whenever they came to Arkansas.  I mean, I'm, I'm thankful today that, that she's still alive at this point.  But it's like, I mean, she was--she was just a great mom.  I mean, as for me because I was the--I'm the sixth child and she--her thing was, you, you can always do whatever you wanted to do.  And her thing is that you gotta pay the price.  Now, when--you can do what you wanna do, as long as it's legal (laughter).  If it's illegal, no, you can't do it.
Speaker 1: Was there any--since you had so many siblings, was there any alone time that you spent with your mother?
Speaker 2: A lot.  A lot because what happened, we were spaced at least a year and a half to two years apart, and I was the one that always went with her to my grandfather house.  I was the one that would go there.  I was the momma's boy.  Matter of fact, that was when I left to go to grad school because I didn't wanna stay at--I mean, I didn't even--I was--I was like a clinger, clinging to my mom.  You know how if you use the old phrase by--you know, "you scratch somebody's hair?"  I would go and I would scratch my mom's hair, and that was--you know, I was--I was that boy that would do that, all right?  And then when I started dating and stuff and I knew I had to leave Arkansas to go to grad school, 'cause I was--I was--I was a momma's boy.
Story_ID: 361084
Speaker 1: Well, what were some of the things that you learned during your time with your mom [Jessie McGlounce Cole]?
Speaker 2: I learned--I learned how to cook, and I also learned a lot about I would say women, period.  'Cause she would always tell me, you know, you're--, "These things you need to do for your spouse or you do for your girlfriend."  She was always, you know, "Be, be nice to them," you know.  I mean, "Listen to them, always listen."  But I really learned how to cook from her because her whole thing was: "If your wife don't cook, then you can always feed yourself."
Speaker 1: And that makes sense.
Speaker 2: Made a lot of sense.
Story_ID: 361085
Speaker 1: Okay, so is there a story about how your mother [Jessie McGlounce Cole] and father [Sam Cole, Jr.] met?
Speaker 2: I'm not sure.  I've never--I never--I never asked that.  I never asked that (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.  All right.
Story_ID: 361086
Speaker 1: Tell me about your siblings.  Tell me where they fall in line and where you fall in.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Tell me their names and--
Speaker 2: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous)their procession.
Speaker 2: Vera [Vera Cole Washington] is, is the oldest.  She's, she's the oldest and Vera was born in 1950.  Sammia [Sammia Cole Thomas], the next oldest who I'm very close to right now.  Let, let me back up.  Vera, Vera is a teacher, Sammia is--Sammia is a counselor, and she also owns her own business.  She, she owns a grocery store in Arkansas.  She was born in 1952.  James [James Cole], my brother I'm very close to, born in 1954.  He is a--he's a machine operator in Oklahoma.  Marie [Marie Cole Jones], she was born in 1956.  She's in Arkansas and, and she's a--mostly a housewife.  My sister, Ruthie [Ruthie Cole Mack], is a, a dietician, born in 1958.  I was born in 1960, and Rosie [Rosie Cole] was born in 1962.  All of us--I'm, I'm, I'm proud to say that all of us, we've done well in terms of, you know, just making a living for ourselves, not, not being in trouble.  You know, we, we try to be respect--respectful in the community.  Out of all of us, I think that Sammia, Sammia and I, Sammia--I got--well, I got my--I was the first one to get a master's [degree] in the family.  Then, there was Sammia, she obtained hers.  And Sammia and I talk almost every, every, every day.  We talk every day.  She's my--I didn't say favorite sister (laughter), but, but, but we talk every day.  We talk about life, we talk about--mainly like our, our spiritual side and where we wanna be.  Ruth--I mean--I mean, I, I get--I get along with all of them very well, and my brother and I are very close.  James and I are very close because we're the only two boys in the family.  And we talk--we, we talk at least once a week.  Ruth, I mean, I have a good relationship with all of them, but the ones that--I think that Sammia and I got the connectedness, because Sammia was always the one that was always there for me.  She was always understanding and she's--and she's--and she still is.  Whenever I have a problem, I can--I can call big sister Sammia.  She gonna--she gonna try to work it out.  If she can't, she gonna find a way--gonna find a way--gonna find a way to do it.  And we always have been together, in so many ways.
Story_ID: 361087
Speaker 1: Let's talk about your growing up, your early years.  You were living in, in what part of Arkansas?
Speaker 2: In Pine Bluff.
Speaker 1: Pine Bluff.  Tell me what the community was like in Pine Bluff.
Speaker 2: A small city, maybe, what about fifty thousand people, like any southern town that you may wanna see.  It was--and it was segregated, the first--I would say from the--from one through--the first through the fourth grade [at Indiana Street Elementary School, Pine Bluff, Arkansas].  And that was just that it--that it--that it, as it was.
Speaker 1: Who are the people who lived in your community?
Speaker 2: I was fortunate to have a lot of teachers and I remember a lot of the coaches.  My high school--my junior high football coach [Jimmy Sanders] who, who I hope--I hope he's gonna move here soon, you know.  I found--I found that out and I was excited about that.  They would pull you aside, and they would--I would play football, I was good at sports.  They would--we played--we played--we played ball together.  And they taught me how to play ball and they would always tell you, you know, you gotta make good grades, you gotta make good grades.  That was--that was the whole philosophy.
Speaker 1: Did your family own the family house?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we owned the home.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, we did own the home.
Speaker 1: All right.
Story_ID: 361088
Speaker 1: Okay, just wanna step back a little bit and we were talking about the, the community in which you, you lived and where--I was trying to ask you whether it was rural in the fact that it was a farm or was it just a residential community?
Speaker 2: It was basically both.  It was residential and it was farm 'cause the people across the street, they raised pigs and they had chickens whereas my [paternal] grandfather [Sam Cole, Sr.] who lived in Terry [Arkansas], he had all those things for us.  So it was a combination of both even though it was in the city--I would say in the city limits of Pine Bluff [Arkansas].  We started to raise hogs, but as I stated earlier, my granddad, he took those over and we--and we went to Terry, Arkansas, and got that done.
Story_ID: 361089
Speaker 1: Was it six--well, five brothers and sisters, how was your, your, your day spent as far as chores, games that you played--
Speaker 2: Everybody had chores.  I mean, in the mornings, like I said, the main thing came out from my dad [Sam Cole, Jr.] was, "What are you gonna contribute today?  Your sister is, is upstairs with your mom [Jessie McGlounce Cole] doing the laundry--"
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Okay.
Speaker 2: "--your brother [James Cole] outside, he doing--he doing the lawn, what are you gonna do?"  There's always something.  But then you had time to play and you had time, time to have fun, too.
Speaker 1: Okay.

Speaker 1: Tell me what was your--what is your earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: Which one?  Good or bad?
Speaker 1: It doesn't matter.
Speaker 2: Oh, earliest.  I had a lot of good childhood memories 'cause I had--I had a lot of nurturing, one--I had people who was always--who respected my talent.  I guess the one that stand out the most was when I was like eleven years old, I won this art competition at the neighborhood arts center and I remember the lady coming to my mom [Jessie McGlounce Cole] house and told them I had won it, like, well, you know, I, I won this competition.  So I have a piece hanging in the Arkansas Art Center [Little Rock, Arkansas] when I was eleven years old.
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: And they took my parents, we all went to, to the awards ceremony.  I guess that's the most--the one that stands, stands out the most.
Story_ID: 361091
Speaker 1: You started elementary school, what school did you go to?
Speaker 2: Indiana Street Elementary [Indiana Street Elementary School, Pine Bluff, Arkansas].
Speaker 1: Okay.  And were there teachers there that you remember?
Speaker 2: Miss B.J. Taylor [ph.], never forget her (laughter).  She was the one that made me always because I stuttered to, you know--that's no excuse.  I had to get work done.  I would always try--and I--sometimes I would try to stutter so I wouldn't have to read and she--and she'd tell me, "Cole [HistoryMaker Kevin Cole], you--Cole, you--it doesn't matter, you're gonna read it," (laughter), "this, no matter what."
Speaker 1: Okay, so she encouraged you.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Was there anyone else?
Speaker 2: I had a few of the--well, let's say, Miss Bradshaw [ph.], fourth grade teacher.  She was the one--I did all the posters for her class, I did all her bulletin boards.  I got extra credit.  But she always made sure I did all my work first and I would hurry up and get my work done so I could do a bulletin board.  Miss Bradshaw was it.  And I think she's still living.
Speaker 1: And, and you mentioned a, a coach that's coming to, to live here?  What coach is that?
Speaker 2: It's Coach Jimmy Sanders.  He's in--he's in Texas now.  He was my junior high coach [at Southeast Junior High School, Pine Bluff, Arkansas].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, we'll talk more (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 1: --about him when we get to junior high school.
Story_ID: 361092
Speaker 1: So, when did you start or, or find out that you really had a talent for art?
Speaker 2: I guess when I was eleven.  I've, I've always liked to draw.  And I think being that I was--I was some--I was somewhat quiet but I was a little bit radical at times, and I would communicate with my drawings, and that was when I was like eleven years old.
Speaker 1: And how would you do that?
Speaker 2: I would always draw.  I mean, I would do sketches, I would draw anything.  I mean, I always--you know, I always find a way to make money 'cause I, I, I didn't believe--you know, I was--I was making money.  I would do sketches and, and then if I wanted--if I wanted a girlfriend, I'd do a drawing for her (laughter).  You know, I was--I mean, I, I always did--I always worked, again.  That's the way I worked, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Story_ID: 361093
Speaker 1: So now you go on to junior high school.  Now, let me ask you.  In, in high--in, in elementary school [Indiana Street Elementary School, Pine Bluff, Arkansas], of course, it was--it was segregated.  Were your teachers black or white?
Speaker 2: Most of them were black.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And when I got to middle school at--yeah, at Belair Middle--at Belair Middle School [Pine Bluff, Arkansas]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --which was the fifth and sixth grade.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I experienced segreg- that's when segregation happened for me and I was--it was a shock for me because the fact of having a white teacher and looking at TV and seeing what I seen that--what white people, they would do to you.  It was a culture shock.  But my, my mom [Jessie McGlounce Cole] and my parents were always supportive of that, but there was--you know--you know, it, it doesn't matter about that you're going and doing what you're supposed to do and do your job.
Story_ID: 361094
Speaker 1: Now, you were born right before--well, right in the beginning of the Civil Rights Movement.  Were your parents [Jessie McGlounce Cole and Sam Cole, Jr.] political at all?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I always vote.  I remember always--I mean, even--my mom liked to pick up my dad--I mean, my mom would--stayed home while my dad would go and my dad would stay home while my mom would go.  They would--they would go.  And the thing that stayed in my mind was, was when Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] died, my mom was crying.  I'm like, "Why you--why you crying?  You didn't know him" (laughter), you know.  That's, that's all I could think of.  And then when Kennedy died, she was crying.  I be like, "You know, why you crying 'cause you didn't know these people?"  And, and, and she's--and I remember when Dr. King died, she said, "Baby, one day you'll--one day you'll understand," and I do now, but I could never--I mean, "Why you crying, momma?"  When Dr. King was assassinated, she was--she--when we were outside, we were planting flowers.  I'll never forget it and she was crying, went inside and--I mean, we would listen to the radio, you know, had the transistor radio outside.  She was crying.
Speaker 1: You said you were planting flowers?
Speaker 2: Flowers.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: I'm like, well:  "I mean, he, he wasn't a friend of the family's" (laughter), you know.  "I never seen him," you know (laughter).  So--I didn't understand it.
Story_ID: 361095
Speaker 1: So now you have white teachers and you're in middle school [Belair Middle School, Pine Bluff, Arkansas] and, were there any teachers that stand out in your mind?
Speaker 2: Mrs.--Miss Osborne [ph.] was the first one that I had.  Matter of fact, I wanted to make contact with her a couple years ago.  She's still teaching, was real supportive.  And when I say supportive was, you know, if a--back then, if a child stuttered, they thought you were supposed to be in special education.  But, you know, even though she realized how smart I was and, you know--and she talked to my parents [Jessie McGlounce Cole and Sam Cole, Jr.] and she would not let them put me--put me in special education.
Speaker 1: Well, what kind of student were you?
Speaker 2: I was--I was a--I was a fairly bright student.  It's just like, you know--you know, reading out loud, if you--unless you told me you--I mean, I took a few speech classes.  I didn't take speech classes until I was in the seventh and eighth grade, and you went to speech class and people thought you were--you were dumb.  You know, but I'll never forget that my, my mom would never--wouldn't allow them to do me that way.  I made--I made good grades.  I made A's and Bs, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 361096
Speaker 1: Well, were you a mischievous child?  What, what--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: No?
Speaker 2: I wasn't--I was--I was--I wasn't a mischievous child.  I was one of those kids that I stayed--I stayed--I stayed off to myself and when you bother me, you're gonna have a problem.  But if you didn't--I mean, I was always that way.  Now, occasionally, I would fight.  I, I mean, you know, you got five sisters and one brother [James Cole], so you grew up in a neighborhood, a community, that, that would fight.  I was on the east side [of Pine Bluff, Arkansas], which was the side of town that, that you had to fight.  And so, now, I would fight if I had to, but I, I didn't bother anybody.
Speaker 1: So, what is--what does that mean to live on the east side?
Speaker 2: The east side was the side of town where it wasn't a--it was--okay, it was across the tracks, but then you had a town apart with the west side, it was across the tracks too.  Then you--then you--then you had downtown.  And, you know, we were fortunate that--we were fortunate to own our own home.  We, we had--I mean, we still got property there.  You know, we got, you know, what at least an acre or two there.  We had--we had our own home.  And we never realized how blessed we were until, you know, later, that we had a house, we had--you know, I, I mean, we grew, you know, crops there.  We wanted to--wanted to do--all those things, they, they were there.
Speaker 1: So, living on the east side meant that what?
Speaker 2: East side was one of the sides where we had the high school called Southeast High School [Pine Bluff, Arkansas], and the, the mascot, it was the, the Panthers.  And, you know, it was like--it's one of those situations whereas if you went to Southeast, you couldn't go over to the town apart.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: So it was one of those, like the rivalry things.
Speaker 1: And so that's when you would have to fight?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, I got you.
Story_ID: 361097
Speaker 1: Okay, so now you go to junior high school 'cause you only do the fifth and sixth grade at, at Belair Middle School [Pine Bluff, Arkansas] and then you attend--
Speaker 2: Southeast.
Speaker 1: Southeast Junior High School [Pine Bluff, Arkansas].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Right.  And tell me about your experience there.  Are you--now, is your art starting to develop or are you coming into yourself?  What--what's going on?
Speaker 2: I'm coming into myself, but I was good in sports.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I mean, I played football, I played basketball.  I was good in--I was good in both.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that's what I thought I was gonna be.  You know, you--that, the mentality, this is what I'm gonna do, that I was good in both.  And then my junior high coach [Jimmy Sanders], I mean, the guy who lived in my neighborhood happened, happened to be my junior high coach and I thought I was gonna--I thought I was going to the promised land (laughter), you know.  I got--you know, I got--I got hurt a few times and that was a--I mean, that was a part of it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, tell me what else was going on during, during your junior high years.
Speaker 2: You know, you--junior high, you know, you are going through adolescence, you're going through girls, you know.  I've always--I mean, I always--and then I, I always liked clothes so I always--my parents [Jessie McGlounce Cole and Sam Cole, Jr.] always dressed me nice.  My whole family always dressed nice.  My mom would sew and make things for me and then Sammia [Sammia Cole Thomas], my older sister, she was a seamstress.  She makes me anything I wanna make.  She can--she can look at somebody and she just make it.  I mean, even when she was in college, she was doing--she was doing all those things.  So, they were--they were very good years and they were years I looked at where I liked art but I never--didn't think of it being a occupation for me.
Story_ID: 361098
Speaker 1: When you think back to that time, what are the sights, the sounds, and the smells that you remember?
Speaker 2: I remember, sights, I was going to--going to football games, seeing the things around there and then experiencing, being part of the football team.  Smells, it was--Pine Bluff [Arkansas] had this paper company called, called International, paper--a paper mill, International paper mill [International Paper Company], and they smell.  Oh, they smell.  I mean, I'm talking about--Pine Bluff was so bad, everybody used to call it Beat Stink City (laughter), the paper mill, it would smell, it would smell.  Sounds, Parliament-Funkadelic, Bootsy Collins (laughter); that was it.
Speaker 1: Okay (laughter).
Story_ID: 361099
Speaker 1: In junior high school [Southeast Junior High School, Pine Bluff, Arkansas] was there anyone who influenced you or encouraged you, teacher, counselor?
Speaker 2: It was--well, I think it was--it was two people.  It was my seventh grade teacher.  Her name was Miss Weedler [ph.] and playing football, you know, you have a crush on your science teacher.  "Miss Weedler, all right, I'm playing football, and Miss Weedler promised she's gonna come to the game."  The only interception I ever got, I was looking in the stands, Miss Weedler wasn't there (laughter) okay?  And Jimmy Sanders, my football coach who was in my neighborhood, he was always the one with the discipline.  You know--you know, "You can always be better.  I mean, you got the--you got the mentality to be--to be whatever you wanna be."  Jimmy Sanders was it.  He was the man.  And he's one that stayed--even I think about sometimes in terms of, you know--you know, when you get to those crossroads, that you look at--you, you, you look at what people say, say to you.  It's all--it's all about work ethics.  You gotta be able to work at it.  That's what--that's what sets you aside from everybody else.
Story_ID: 361100
Speaker 1: So, now you--you're getting ready to go to high school.  Tell me about Pine Bluff High School [Pine Bluff, Arkansas].
Speaker 2: Pine Bluff High School was--it was the largest high school in the state.
Speaker 1: In the state?
Speaker 2: In the state of, of Arkansas.  There were over, over, over three thousand students.  It was from tenth grade through twelfth grade, very progressive.  It was mainly black and white.  I played--I played, played sports.  I played sports from the tenth through the eleventh grade.  I was--I was pretty good at--I played basketball and I played, played football.  I was good at both.  I tore my ankles my--I'm, I'm sorry.  I tore ligaments in my ankles, my tenth grade year.  I did again my eleventh grade year.  And, and the doctor said if I did it again, I may--I may not ever, ever walk again.  So, I kept taking art classes.  I had no idea I wanted--'cause I never--I used to be in my art class and I would--I would throw clay.  Again, I mean, I was sneaky, but I always made--I always made good grades.  I did enough to survive at times.  I had maybe like a, a two--well, a 2.9 or 2.8 [grade point average].  I remember my art teacher, Miss Marianne Sanfer [ph.].  I'll, I'll never forget her.  I did this fist, the black power sign out of clay, and she took it to the state fair, and she said, "Kevin [HistoryMaker Kevin Cole], I hate to tell you, it's done very well but she--but I'm sure, if there are no black judges, you not gonna win this thing," and it--and, and I didn't.  But the best decision she told me about was, she said, "You know what?  You need to go to University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff [Pine Bluff, Arkansas], HBC, historic black college."  In the meantime, I had like eleven scholarship offers.  I had a few in sports that were still, you know, saying, okay, you make it, come here.  I had a few academic ones.  But she said, "You know, your best decision is you need to go to University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff."  I'll never forget it.  Best decision I've made in my life 'cause she'd said, "You know what, it's a historic black college, but there's some good people out there.  I mean, you--they, they got a great art department and the rest was history.
Speaker 1: So, tell me about your art besides the clay.  Was there any other medium you were working in?
Speaker 2: I did drawings and paintings, but my (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: --main area, it, it was--it was sculpture.  I was all over the place.  I mean, I was--I, I was, like, all dressed up with no place to go.  But I was--I was good at art.  I mean, people would come and see it and, and, you know, I, I, I enjoyed all forms of art.  I was always trying to go see dance, theater, something.  If there--if there was symphony, I'd, I'd be involved.  I listened to all type of music.  I liked to listen to Chopin [Frederic Chopin], Mozart [Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart].  I was into all the arts.
Story_ID: 361101
Speaker 1: So, you decide to go to work--to college, and tell me about your first experience when you get, get to college.
Speaker 2: Well, okay.  When I decided to attend University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff [Pine Bluff, Arkansas], I went out for an interview and I talked to this guy.  His name was John--the late John Howard, and I know there were a lot of people trying to become artists at Pine Bluff.  And Mr. Howard, he took me around and I had these drawings and took me around to all the faculty, and Ernest Davidson, the--'cause I was doing sculpture, Ernest Davidson was the sculpture teacher.  He just died recently.  And then there was--[HistoryMaker] Henri Linton was on leave.  The one that stood--that stood out to me the most was this guy named Tarrance Corbin, guy about maybe 5'6", 5'7".  And everybody was ranting and raving over my portfolio.  I took my portfolio to him.  He looked at it, he said, "It's typical seventeen-year-old work."  I got outside, I said, "You know what?  That little short man, he think he bad," (laughter).  And he became my--he--he's still--he--I'm his--I'm his godson.  We, we talk--we talk every--we talk at least three times a week.  I never knew he would be that mentor for me.  And I always say when my career has gone--I've, I've always had good, good, good mentors.  Ernest Davidson, who recently just passed away, he was the one that, that--he was that calm part of it, for me.  And Ernest--and, and so that's why if you notice, I do paint and sculptures because I would've been torn between painting and sculpture.  So my--I do paint, paint and sculpture or I'm doing metal now.  And the late John Howard was the one that got me involved in, in like--in like education.  And I always would wonder about Mr. Howard.  I'm like--I'll never--I'll never forget, I had a painting class--well, at that time, Mr. Howard--in 1980, Mr. Howard, he was--he, he had gotten old.  Whenever you would ask him to come upstairs to look at your painting, he'll tell you he couldn't come up to look at your painting, but--so, you had to bring your painting down for him, him to see, all right.  And I would do at a time.  He said, you have a nice painting.  But then, you see Mr. Howard in the hallway, he'd tell you, "Cole [HistoryMaker Kevin Cole], nice painting you got upstairs."  I'm like, "How'd you get upstairs?" "'Cause you never bring it up."  And I'll, I'll never forget taking a class with him, and taking a class with Mr. Howard, and in my painting class with him, Mr. Howard, he would beat me up.  I had the best painting in the class, he would just beat me up, I mean, tear me up.  So this girl named--her name was Dorothy Deportes [ph.].  Dorothy was doing these folk-type paintings.  They were real stylized and, and Dorothy would get a A and I'd get a B. "Mr. Howard, but Dorothy can't paint, worth a shit," I would say--but, you know, I would--I would say to myself.  So, then at the end of the semester, he said, "You know what?  I knew what to say to you.  I knew you would always rise to the occasion.  You always rise.  Even though Dorothy couldn't paint, I had to make Dorothy feel good, like she could."  But in my mind, seventeen years old, Dorothy can't paint, okay.  I understand what he was trying to do, but his whole thing was, you know, "At the end--at the end of the day, I always wanted to make sure that you would always--I wanted to know each one of my students--."  Then--and then I asked, I said, "Mr. Howard, why is it everybody want, want to come to Arkansas Pine Bluff?"  He said, "You know what, 'cause--because I know all my people.  You gotta know all your students.  You gotta know what they're capable of doing, what they're not capable of doing at the end of the day."  So I--that philosophy stayed with me as, as I teach.  I always trying to build--I'm always trying to build whoever I can up but then push whoever I can on the--on the side, say, "Okay, this is where you can be and this is what you can be."
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you had some great mentors--
Speaker 2: Oh--
Speaker 1: --your first year of college.  Now, this was in 1978 'cause you graduated from high school [Pine Bluff High School, Pine Bluff, Arkansas]--
Speaker 2: Yeah, in--
Speaker 1: --in--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I graduated in '78 [1978].
Speaker 1: --nineteen seventy-eight [1978], and you went straight to college.
Speaker 2: I went straight to college.  I went to--and then--and then another mentor, like Henri, Henri, Henri Linton who's still the chairman of the department.  And, and we've talked to--and we've talked--we've talked about me coming back and being chairman but I don't think I'm, I'm gonna do that.  But he was the one--he's one of the ones that stayed with me until the end and, and made you work.  It was just it.  I mean, he'd tell you to work all day, work all night, always be--always be prepared, always be better.  And I think with him and Tarrance Corbin, a lot of commissions I've got--you know, commission of Michael Jordan, commission for the Olympics [1996 Summer Olympics, Atlanta, Georgia].  See, I learned--I learned how to do murals when I--when I was seventeen years old.  I was working as an apprentice for Tarrance Corbin and doing things, things for him, washing out paint brushes, blocking in shapes, so that was easy for me.
Story_ID: 361102
Speaker 1: And so who, who taught you how to do the--watching them--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --taught you how to, to do murals?
Speaker 2: Yeah, watching them, but mainly Tarrance Corbin was the one that I was in the studio every day.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, tell me more about, about Tarrance Corbin.  I understand that he was the one who--well, all of these people were winning awards, types of awards in, in a different, at that time for black artists.  Tell me a little more about what was going on for black artists during that time.
Speaker 2: Well, when I came to--
Speaker 1: I mean, being that you were young, I understand that, but these are some heavyweights that you were dealing with.
Speaker 2: Right.  When I came to Arkansas at Pine Bluff [University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff, Pine Bluff, Arkansas], I noticed that Tarrance Corbin had won the Delta Award, which is one of the top prizes in the Southeast.  Henri Linton won the Arkansas Art Competition, and Ernest Davidson had won--had won--had won the Governor's Award.  The Delta Award, only--there are only two black artists to this date that had won the award, the late John Howard won it in nineteen, I wanna say '34 [1934] or '44 [1944], but they wouldn't give the award to Mr. Howard because he was black.  They found out he was black.  He, he did a piece called 'A Letter to Picasso' [sic. 'The Old Lady with a Letter and a Picasso'] this black woman writing this letter.  When they found out he was black, he didn't get it.  Then later, Tarrance Corbin won, won with an abstract landscape, okay.  So when I was looking at that, I was like, hell, they doing it, I can do it too.
Story_ID: 361103
Speaker 1: So, how did your work develop in, in college [University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff, Pine Bluff, Arkansas]?
Speaker 2: I was doing a lot--a lot--a lot of mundane photos and mundane, like shoes, hats.  I've always--I've always been intrigued with the things that we wear.  I've always been intrigued with--I mean, I was doing hats, I was following the aspect of Jim Dine, Claes Oldenburg, the whole pop art movement, I was intrigued with, and it developed from, from, from that point.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, at this point when you're in college, are you showing your art outside of school?
Speaker 2: I was showing my art.  I became a professional artist probably when I was--I was--I was like--I was nineteen years old.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: There was this--I got in my first professional show when I was nineteen years old.
Speaker 1: And where, where was that?  I mean--
Speaker 2: That, that was in Arkansas.  That was at the Southeast Arkansas art center [Arts and Science Center for Southeast Arkansas, Pine Bluff, Arkansas].  I did these hats, they were made out of steel.  I did a series of, of steel hats, won all kind, kind of competition.  But they were encouraging me to go ahead and, and do that, and, and apply for shows.  I didn't wanna do it.  I mean, you know, "Please, man," you know.  So, I was--I was ahead of the game before everybody else.  They--I mean, they would--they would take shows that were coming, coming into their hands, say, look here, "I'm not gonna do this, why don't--why don't you do it?"  They would--they would make me do it and I would do it and get in the show and sometime win.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, tell me what else happens in college or is it very much, you know, the same that you developed in your work in, in working with these (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Professors.
Speaker 1: --these other artists as your professors?  So what makes you decide to go to graduate school?
Speaker 2: I didn't.  I, I, I have to back up a little bit because I, I wanted to be a welder and a brick layer.  I want--I figured I'd make enough money in the summer, and it would last me in the--during the wintertime, that was my philosophy, okay.  And, you know, got the scholarships, so then I went to college.  And so one day, I was--there, there was a group of students from Pine Bluff High School [Pine Bluff, Arkansas], they came in.  They were--they had them in the gallery, and they were out--it was outlandish.  It was wild and crazy.  So I was told to, to go in and quiet them down.  I was a sophomore.  I was a--I was a--like advertising, advertising major or design major, went in, started talking to them.  You know, most high school kids, most, most of them wanted to--they were talking about--they were talking about relationships, their peers, and sports.  I developed a little game for them, put them on one side.  We, we talked, talked about everything.  Then, I developed a thing that the last part we start talking about relationships, boys and girls.  We did like a dating game thing.  So they were quiet and they wanted to, you know--Tarrance Corbin came to me, he said, "Well, what did you do them?"  I said, "I ain't doing--."  I--okay, he said, "You know what, think about teaching."  "I'm like, me?  Nah.  You know, I stutter and, I mean--."  So--anyway, he talked--and he talked me--he talked me into it.  And a couple years later, Bill Atkins who was in grad school at--well, who had been in grad school at University of Illinois at Champaign-Urbana [sic. University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Champaign-Urbana, Illinois], he said to me, he said--he said--he said, "Okay, I'll tell you what.  You wanna go to grad school," I said, "What's that?"
Story_ID: 361104
Speaker 1: Okay, before we go to grad school, let's just step back for a second and I need you to spell the names of, of Tarrance Corbin?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Okay, T-A-R-R-A-N-C-E.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And Corbin, C-O-R-B-I-N.
Speaker 1: And Henri Linton?
Speaker 2: H-E-N-R-I, L-I-N-T-O-N.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And you talked about--what did Tarrance Corbin teach [at University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff, Pine Bluff, Arkansas]?
Speaker 2: Tarrance taught drawing and painting and art history.
Speaker 1: And Ernest Davidson?
Speaker 2: Ernest Davidson taught sculpture and, and, and ceramics.
Speaker 1: And Henri Linton?
Speaker 2: Henry Linton taught painting composition and printmaking, and he was always chairman of the department.
Speaker 1: And the late John Howard?
Speaker 2: He taught mainly, mainly painting, but it was only one course.  He was a--what do you call, a professor of emeritus.
Story_ID: 361105
Speaker 1: And, and, and while you were at the University of Arkansas Pine Bluff [University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff, Pine Bluff, Arkansas], you also pledged, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Tell me about your pledge experience.
Speaker 2: Well, I pledged--I, I pledged, pledged Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity, Incorporated, which the art department was real big on not pledging.  I was one of the few people that pledged and passed the same semester, okay.  And I had to work my butt off.  I didn't let anybody know I was doing it until I started doing it.  My first semester, I buckled down into the books, so I knew the second semester and then when I got ready to pledge, hey, that's, that's what I was gonna do.
Story_ID: 361106
Speaker 1: Halima Taha's book ['Collecting African American Art: Works on Paper and Canvas']?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Tell me about that.
Speaker 2: Halima Taha's book has been one that--I think one of the most influential books concerning collecting and buying works by African American artists.  I missed the book by about a couple of days.  She has been very--I mean, even though I missed the book, I always used it as a catalyst so people can understand about buying art, buying art as an investment or buying art as what you like, or buying different African American artists.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And it is in it's--it's fifth--it's fifth edition of being printed.
Story_ID: 361107
Speaker 1: Okay, so now we were talking--you were getting ready to--you were dealing with the students and you say, "What is grad school?"  So what happens after that (laughter)?
Speaker 2: Well, well Bill Atkins came to me and he say--he say, "You going to grad school?"  I was like, "What is grad school?" He say, "Well, you wanna--it's where you further your education and, you know, you can get a master's [degree]."  "Oh, wow," and I mast--went home, told my momma [Jessie McGlounce Cole], "I'm gonna get a master's."  "Oh, wow," you know, whatever.  So, I still didn't know what, what it--what it entailed.  So, anyway, I applied, I got a full ride, all right.  The dates--three, three weeks before I'm, I'm getting ready to leave, my dad [Sam Cole, Jr.] went to the hospital.  Everybody kept saying, you know, "You need to wait, you need to wait, you need to wait."  You know, I waited until he got out the hospital and I went--I went ahead to grad school at University of Illinois Champaign-Urbana [sic. University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Champaign-Urbana, Illinois].  And when I got there, I walked around for three days, I didn't see no black people (laughter).  The first African American I met was--well, no, the first black person I met was a Nigerian guy who didn't speak no English.  So, it was--it was--it was a experience, experience I enjoyed, but it was experience that was--that made me realize how, how, how the--how the real world was.  Because I had--I had a professor, I won't call his name, and I disagreed with him about--he said that white artists' work was superior to women and black artists, and I wrote a paper on a few black artists, and he gave me a, a B on it.  And I wondered why he did it and, and when we finished, we had a long discussion and he said, "You know what, by law, when you graduate, by law, I have to let you in, if you qualify, but I don't have to let you graduate."
Speaker 1: Wow.  So how did that make you feel?
Speaker 2: I was--I was--I was upset and mad about it.  And then I--I mean, and so later, I read a few books by him where he went back and--he went back and changed some of his conversations, what he thought about black artists.  But I, I was upset.  I even went to the one of the--one of the--one of the deans but, you know, he, he--I mean, he had tenure.  They weren't gonna do anything about that.
Story_ID: 361108
Speaker 1: When you went to grad school [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Champaign-Urbana, Illinois], were you working basically on your artwork or had you decided that you wanted to do something in education because of the--
Speaker 2: Well, I was--
Speaker 1: --the students?
Speaker 2: I was fortunate because I had finished--I finished my certification in Arkansas [University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff, Pine Bluff, Arkansas], so I was doing mostly my artwork, and I had--I, I had a big show there and then while I was in grad school.  That one year, I had a big show.  I did a whole series of tennis shoes that assume, assume the personality of people that was--that was well received.  In other words, I would ask, ask you for your tennis shoes and try to make your tennis shoes assume your personality.  It was--it was--it was well received.  And so I was fortunate I was already certified.  So I--the only thing I was doing, I was taking a few study classes and I was doing my artwork.  So I got my--I got my degree in one year.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you graduated in what year?
Speaker 2: Eighty-three [1983].
Speaker 1: In--undergrad in--
Speaker 2: Undergrad, undergrad in 1982.
Speaker 1: Eighty-two [1982].
Speaker 2: And, and I got my M.A. in 1983.
Speaker 1: Okay, so nineteen eighty (pause)--so, your artwork up to this point seems to be about clothing, is that right?
Speaker 2: It was about clothing, it was about--it was about shoes, everything that we--that we wore, it was about that.
Speaker 1: And did it always start off as a drawing?  I know you, you were saying that your hats--
Speaker 2: I was--I was doing drawings and paintings.  I was doing a few sculptures.  I was--I was actually modeling the things.  I was doing everything with it.
Speaker 1: So you--well, what I was saying is, as you said before or I, I don't know whether you said this on, on tape, that--how you came about doing the steel hats was that you drew it first and then decided to make it into a sculpture.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Does that happen each time with the--
Speaker 2: Right, with everything.
Speaker 1: With everything?
Speaker 2: What, what I always do--I always do sketches first.  I work--I work--I work from sketches, then I--then I do the work.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So when did the idea of the neck ties come about?
Speaker 2: I was always doing the neck ties.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But it wasn't until my [paternal] grandfather [Sam Cole, Sr.] died and, you know, being one who stuttered, you're always encouraged to keep a diary, you know, a journal, 'cause the journal allows you to know what times you're gonna stutter more or when you stutter more or when they--you know, how stressful it is.  And I always wondered why neck ties would always--I would have a tennis shoe with a neck tie on.  I did a--I did a painting of, what hats, with a--with a neck tie hanging on the wall.  Neck tie always stayed in my work, it always stayed in my work.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But it wasn't until after he died, I started to make it a, a thing.  And I--you know, you always wonder, wonder, wonder why you--why you're doing things.  That's when I did it.
Story_ID: 361109
Speaker 1: So tell me what happens after you graduate from grad school [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Champaign-Urbana, Illinois].
Speaker 2: Well, okay, so what I did was I, I wanted to go and get my Master's of Fine Art degree which is--which is a--which is a term of degree like a Ph.D.  So I went to Northern--well, I applied at--applied, applied at Ohio State [The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio], I applied at University of Cincinnati [Cincinnati, Ohio]--well, I applied to like eleven schools.  My first three, I was--I was rejected from.  Then, I got in--I got in Ohio State, East Conference University [ph.] (unclear), Wayne State [Wayne State University, Detroit, Michigan].  I was rejected from Cincinnati.  University of Massachusetts at Amherst [University of Massachusetts Amherst, Amherst, Massachusetts], I was accepted there.  So I decided to go to, to, to Northern Illinois University [DeKalb, Illinois] just outside Chicago [Illinois].  I wanted to be close to the Chicago area.  I got a--I got a Rhodes (unclear) scholar, fellowship--I mean, a, a fellowship/assistantship, that was it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And so what happened?
Speaker 2: I went to grad school there and I loved it, so I got my M.A. and my M.F.A. in two years, which normally takes most people to get an M.F.A. two years.  I got both degrees because my M.A. overlapped with my--with my M.F.A.  So I stayed around there a year.  And, and in--and in doing that, my--as I finished up, my--as I finished, finished up my degree there, I taught--I taught there.  I did like an internship there.  And I'd like to tell a story, that I did a series of clothing of kids who were killed in drive-by shootings.  I was in Chicago, I would always go to--go on the South Side, the South and West Side to, to teach a class, and being from Arkansas, I had never heard of a drive-by shooting.  There was no drive-by shootings in Arkansas, drive-by shooting.  So these kids would come in, they would talk about, you know, "So-and-so got killed."  And, and I noticed all these kids that--they defied the--you know, they were always on the--living on the edge.  So I asked these kids to bring me in a garment of somebody who they knew who had been killed in drive-by shooting and I had them--had them--had them to write something about them.  So I did this series of clothing that defied the law of the gravity.  They were hanging--they were like a jacket that would be hanging off a hanger and it--and it almost touched the floor, but it would--it would be just stuck in the air.  And I was--I, I, I finished up the work, I was hanging the show.  To make a long story short, there, it was called like a student center art gallery and I proudly, and I asked one of my professors how should I price the work?  He told me don't price it because nobody buys it.  Well, I'm hanging--I am hanging the show that night, I'm hanging the show up, you know.  I mean, it was like two o'clock in the morning.  This guy by the name of Charles Price [ph.] comes down and he couldn't sleep.  He was the vice president of Johnson--Johnson Products [Johnson Products Company, Chicago, Illinois].  And he thought--he thought--he thought that they were real clothes hanging on the wall.  So I told him, "I said, well, this is--."  Told him the concept behind it.  He said, "Okay," so he said, "Well, I'll tell you what, I want this one, this one."  He said, "No, I want this whole wall."  I said, "Sir, if this is a joke, I don't--I don't--I don't think it's funny."  Went upstairs, wrote me out a--wrote me out a check for the whole show.
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: My graduate thesis show sold, sold out before it opened.
Speaker 1: So this was your graduate thesis--
Speaker 2: Show.
Speaker 1: --show, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Was there a name for it?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was entitled, 'Have You Checked the Closet?' [ph.].
Speaker 1: Okay.  So that had to be mind-blowing.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Oh.
Story_ID: 361110
Speaker 1: Now, let me--let me just ask you, in some other arenas, you know, a black artist had a very hard time.  What is your experience about galleries and being (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I've been extremely blessed because I mean, you do have a hard time, but I think, you know, if--I always feel like your steps gotta be ordered, you know.  And I--and I would say to people, I, I always pray about everything.  And like right now, I have--I had nine galleries around the country.  Right now, I got about six.  All of them sell.  And I think you gotta--you know, you gotta figure out what works best, best for you.  I was just talking to a gentleman the other day 'cause our last show sold out, I got picked up by a gallery in Chicago [Illinois].  The experience was okay, but I didn't know who was--who was buying my work, so, so I left the gallery.
Speaker 1: Why did that make a difference to you?
Speaker 2: Because, because I--you know, as an artist, you wanna--always wanna know where your--where your work is going.  So--but I, I just think for me, my situation had been different.  I mean, I think I've been truly blessed that I've been--I mean, I've been selling work and, and I do.  I, I sell a lot of work.  I been--when I say I sell a lot, the people (unclear) I get--I get commissions.  And even the--even the, the, the one I got for the Olympics [1996 Summer Olympics, Atlanta, Georgia], I mean, how do you go about--they looked at over 1,000 artists and I got a--what some say between 500 and, and 500,000 and a million dollar commission for the Olympics.  How does a--you know, I don't even--I don't even paint realistically, so, you know, it's a God-given thing.  God--
Speaker 1: How do you--how do you characterize your work?
Speaker 2: I always say that they are abstract paintings that deal with, with, with the relationship between sight, sound, and color with, with African patterns.  And I always say that, that, that right now, they're based on five things.  Number one, a story that my [paternal] grandfather [Sam Cole, Sr.] told me, number two, the relationship between sight, sound, and color, number three, September 11th [September 11, 2001 (9/11)] now, number four, Katrina [Hurricane Katrina], which is evolving right now into the work, and number five, my experience as an--as an artist and, and as an educator, things I hear, things I see, things that people, people tell me.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Thinking back to the time when you, you go to, to college and you're the only black person that you see.
Speaker 2: Yeah (laughter).
Speaker 1: Tell me--it had to be some stories about--
Speaker 2: I got--I was gonna say, I got a good one for you.  Well, you know, when--Northern Illinois [Northern Illinois University, DeKalb, Illinois] had the second largest art department in the country, right, so this professor comes in, he says to us--there were three--there were--there were over three hundred graduate students, "Only two of you are gonna be artists.  All you females are gonna drop out, see how hard it is to become an artist, have kids, will never paint again.  All of you minorities gonna see how racist this system is, how bad it is, then--and never paint again.  And then, all--the rest of you all are gonna be waiters, dishwashers, and construction workers."  I was mad as hell, had a long--I said--I, "I got a letter, I was gonna write and give it--give it to the dean."  So I'm sitting there, I'm mad, but ten years later, he was--he was right.  There were only two of us from, from that class that were doing artwork.  It was me and this Hispanic girl.  He was right about the two, but, but, but it was the wrong people.  So when--so when I got my, my, my commission for the Olympics, I sent him a copy of the newspaper article.  I wanted--I, I wanted to send him a copy of the contract, but I said, "No, I ain't gonna do him like that," (laughter).
Speaker 1: Did he respond to you?
Speaker 2: No, he never did.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) He didn't?
Story_ID: 361111
Speaker 1: When you talk about the system being racist, do you find that to be true?
Speaker 2: Very much true.  When--okay, when you think about, okay, right now--and I think that I've had--even, even now with my work being--even though--even though it's abstract, right now it's a catch-22.  People wanna see work that, that automatically identifies you as being black, so the system has changed a bit.  But I think at an earlier time, if you were doing--if you were doing black imagery, people, people, people--I mean, the white community, they wouldn't include you in no--in, in the art shows because it was too black.  And now when people ask me if I do black art, I say, well, "You know, you look at me, am I--am I black," or whatever.  So, it's a catch-22 now.  I, I recently had a client to--well, I thought was gonna be a client in Maryland.  He and--he and his wife loved this piece I did.  The piece was called--what was--oh, 'African Proverbs: Looking for Faith' [ph.]. They loved it.  It was this piece with a lot of marvelous color, bright colors and it was done.  So then I'm sitting there looking at them.  I asked them--asked them, "Do you like it?"  They said, "Yeah, we love this piece.  This piece is a wonderful print."  So then I told them--they, they said, "Well, tell us about it."  I told them about the idea of the--of the neck ties weaving in and out, the concept of my [paternal] grandfather [Sam Cole, Sr.] was telling me the African Americans being lynched by their neck ties on, on, on their way to vote.  And the, the, the guy was a prominent lawyer, white lawyer.  He said, "You know what?  I wish had never heard, heard, heard the story behind it."
Speaker 1: So, the story behind it made him decide not to wanna buy the piece.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Wow.  Well, when you were talking about that it's a catch-22 if you, you know, paint, you know, like black faces--
Speaker 2: Um-hm, black imagery.
Speaker 1: Imagery, that you wouldn't be included in some of the--either shows or galleries.  But do you think that it's true that as African Americans that, that we collect what we--what we see of ourselves--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --more so than abstract?
Speaker 2: Well, I think African Americans, we collect what look like us.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: What we can identify with.  But I found that with African Americans, you can--they--we collect if we know about it and we--and we are afraid of abstraction.  It's not--but most white people are afraid of abstraction, too.  But a lot of African Americans started--it wasn't until the basketball players started buying, like Michael Jordan getting my work, Darrell Walker, Harvey Grant, it wasn't until then, it was okay to buy a [HistoryMaker] Kevin Cole 'cause there was a--there was a, a signature piece that, that goes with the whole thing.  Okay, but I think that African Americans, we always wanna see something that look like us.  I mean, not understanding it could be abstract because we think outside the box.  It's funny because I always--I always use the idea of, if somebody came in and they--and they robbed all of us and, and they had on dark-colored clothes, I may say, well you know what?  He had on a, like indigo blue jacket.  You may say it was black.  Scott [ph.] may say it was--okay, it was a, a dark brown.  But we still in it--we still in the same ballpark.  So you--so you gotta think of it that way.  And I always tell people who come--get ready to buy, I mean, but the thing is, once they buy one of my pieces, I can honestly say, everybody who's already bought one, they always came back and they bought another one.
Story_ID: 361112
Speaker 1: Well, let me ask you this, then, there are some artists who stay in the mainstream white galleries because they paint derogatory works of black like Kara Walker (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Walker.
Speaker 1: What do you think about that?
Speaker 2: It's funny you ask that because Kara Walker used to sit--she used to sit in in my classes at Georgia State [Georgia State University, Atlanta, Georgia], when I taught at Georgia State.
Speaker 1: She was one of--she was in your class?
Speaker 2: She--well, well, she was sitting in--her, her dad and I were good friends.  I taught at Georgia State part-time.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Okay, she would come in and sit in on some of my classes, so I knew her personally.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And when they talk about they were derogatory, I don't have a comment on, on that part because I think the media gonna always pick who--pick, pick who they want, and somehow I think that Kara, one is reaping a lot of benefits of her father [Larry Walker], her father who is--who's a--who's a great painter, artist, educator.  And I like some of her work.  Now, the ones that--I don't see them as being that derogatory, I see them as being art.  And the ones I don't like, I don't like.  But I still think what she's doing, I mean, she's doing what she make--that--that's her, her expression.  I don't have to like them.  And I always tell people, "You know, if you don't like what you do--you look at TV, what you do?  You change--you change the channel, okay?"  But it's--but it's still art.  And, and what I like about it is, it creates a lot of dialogue.  The dialogue is there.
Story_ID: 361113
Speaker 1: Okay.  I mean, that's, that's fair enough.  You also--well, let me ask you this.  Well, then, tell me some of the artists that you admire.
Speaker 2: Ooh, there's a lot.  Okay, Tarrance Corbin, of course.  You look at my work, you look at his, you--he's a--he's a wonderful educator.  [HistoryMaker] Sam Gilliam, my favorite, my favorite.  My wife [Karen Johnson Cole] and I own, own five.  Funny story, when I had a show in D.C. [Washington, D.C.] that did extremely well, article in, in The Washington Times said that, you know, I, I may be the--be the next Sam, Sam, Sam Gilliam.  So, my, my good friend, Darrell Walker, the basketball player, Darrell told Sam.  Sam invited me to his house for a weekend.  I had a weekend with Sam, Sam Gilliam.  It was like a wealth of knowledge.  We hung out and we talked about art and things I should do, what I should do about my career.  And, see, but--and I think my career had been based on having these mentors that had been around.  I could, you know--Al Loving who just passed away, John T. Scott who's, who's one of the best shows I ever gone to in my life out of New Orleans [Louisiana] who won a MacArthur Genius Grant.  James Brantley out, out of--out of Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] was a mentor, Charles Searles.  I could go on and on and name a lot of artists who I really admire and I just--and, and I--and I love their work.  And I like Frank Stella.  I don't--I don't--another artist who a lot of people don't--you may not hear anything about, he, he just happen to be white, his name is Frank Herrmann who just got a Guggenheim.  I, I mean, I've--I always drawn, drawn to his work.  It's funny 'cause he'll tell a story that I was the one--I encouraged him to apply for a Guggenheim.  He kept applying and he got one.
Speaker 1: Okay.  There are a couple other African American abstract artists, [HistoryMaker] Howardena Pindell--
Speaker 2: Pindell.
Speaker 1: --and Brenda Sinser [ph.] (unclear).  Do you--do you know them at all?
Speaker 2: I know both.  Howardena, I admire.  I always use her, her research and the--and the papers that she did on the drawing at the Whitney [Whitney Museum of American Art, New York, New York] where they had like a, a draw called the (unclear) draw.  And Howardena, I've always admired her coming back from China or Japan and refreshing her memory with the postcards, excellent artist.  I mean, I really, really--I mean--I mean, like [HistoryMaker] Elizabeth Catlett, I admire.  I can talk about--I can talk about a lot of artists, male and female.  But I think right now, I will say this, I think some of the best work that's being done is being done by female artists who happen to be African American.
Story_ID: 361114
Speaker 1: Okay, so we'll come back to some more of your insights about that, but we're at--we had stopped at 1985 and you graduate from Northern Illinois [Northern Illinois University, DeKalb, Illinois], is that right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And so tell me what happens next.
Speaker 2: What happens next, it, it snowed in June.  Okay, I was offered a job at the University of Wisconsin at Madison [University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, Wisconsin], one year appointment.  So, anyway, I didn't--the Fulton County School System had been calling me about coming here, so I always tell this story and it's a--it's a--it's a true story.  So I get--so anyway, I said, "I'll tell you what.  If you all like me, then you pay for my plane fare.  If you don't, then I'll pay for it."  Got the ticket, come down here, I'm waiting, I'm writing down what I'm gonna say, the thing, sitting in, in this area, like Applebee's, like--and this woman sends me a drink, okay.  Get a drink, went and said "Thank you," went and did my interview.  I come back, another woman sends me a drink, waiting to get my plane.  I said, "You know what?  I'm moving to Atlanta [Georgia]," (laughter).  True story (laughter).  So--
Speaker 1: That's a good way to make a decision.
Speaker 2: So, so, I came here and I start--I started teaching at Camp Creek Middle School [College Park, Georgia].  My first year, I was named the teacher of the year of that school, my first year teaching.  I was named teacher of the year of, of, of that school my first year.
Speaker 1: Right.  That's, that's--
Speaker 2: Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) great.
Story_ID: 361115
Speaker 1: It's 1986 and you're teacher of the year for Camp Creek Middle School [College Park, Georgia].  Tell me about your, your first major, I guess, commission (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Commission.
Speaker 1: --to do a piece in Atlanta [Georgia].
Speaker 2: The first major one was, was I did--I did a piece for the new Atlanta, Atlanta City Hall [Atlanta, Georgia] building.  It was called, 'Signs of the Times'; it was the "Daily Agenda" ["The Atlanta Daily Agenda"].  There were over 180 artists that applied for it from nine states and I was fortunate to receive it.  And I didn't get started for a while because the committee's concern was I had never done a large scale piece.  The piece was--ended up being seventeen--seven feet by eighteen feet.  And Maynard [Maynard Jackson] kept asking, though, "What about the piece on the fifth, fifth floor?"  And, and they told him, they said, "Well, the, the committee selected this young black guy," (laughter), you know.  And, and I'll never forget, they asked him and Maynard said, "Well how will we know if he can do it unless we give him a chance?" And I did it.  And the piece won the 1990 Urban Design Award for Public Art.
Speaker 1: And when you say Maynard, you're talking about--
Speaker 2: Maynard Jackson.
Speaker 1: Jackson, the, the mayor--
Speaker 2: Mayor.
Speaker 1: --at that time.
Speaker 2: Maynard Jackson which when I talk about it later, he influenced a lot--a lot of the--of the--of the new work behind me.  But the piece--the piece--the piece was about the artist formerly known as Prince did a series that--album called 'Signs of the Times' ['Signs O' the Times'], education, age, homelessness, and, and actually music.  But when you look at the piece, there was certain things in there that, that I felt the city councilmen, they should be concerned about it.  When I did the piece, everybody loved it, but then when you--when you go to talk about it, what it's about, everybody got quiet.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) So, so, this helped you to, to get more and more commissions, is that right?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, I mean (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) From different buildings here--
Speaker 2: I mean the commission was coming back to back.  I did another piece for Georgia State [Georgia State University, Atlanta, Georgia] called "Rhythm Nation: The Near Future."  It was a piece based on quilts and there--the ties were a lot flatter.  And then I did a whole series of works that were based on kids, kids being kids, killed over their tennis shoes and Starter jackets.  So, I mean, the commission was coming back--they were coming back to back as well as I was--I was teaching in Georgia State University.  And I was at Woodland Middle School [East Point, Georgia], was there in 1990, I became the Teacher of the Year there.
Speaker 1: So you were teaching as a professor at Georgia State--
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: --teaching, what, painting, drawing, and design?
Speaker 2: Yeah, drawing, painting--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --or design.
Speaker 1: Or design.  And then you go to Woodland Middle School--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and that's out in, in East Point, Georgia.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And, once again, you're teacher of the year.
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Okay.
Story_ID: 361116
Speaker 1: So now, in 1990, tell me about Tri-Cities [Tri-Cities High School, East Point, Georgia].
Speaker 2: They--the, the Fulton County Board of Education wanted to start a visual performing arts magnet program.  Tri-Cities was the site that was--that was selected.  And Dr. (unclear) Kellen Chaplin [ph.], the first coordinator of art education, she, she wanted me for this site because of my strong background, and my kids was always winning awards.  I mean, my kids--I'll never forget, my first year of teaching, my kids won about seven awards that was misplaced in the high school category, though they were--they were--they were middle school.  So, so Dr. Chaplin, she wanted me to have that position.  And it came--it became open and I took it.  I took it part-time at first and I was doing--I was at Woodland [Woodland Middle School, East Point, Georgia] still and trying to establish the program 'cause they had what's called extended day.  And when I did, the next year, I went on to Tri-Cities, and my--and my first--and, and, and like the year that I was there, we always got the kids in the governor's honors program, they were always there.  From 1990 'til 1994, 90 percent of my kids attended college on scholarships 'cause I was brought there for that.  And I would always have them--I would--they would--they were, you know, winning awards.  And one thing I always tried to do was to balance my career, you know, my career as an artist and balance my career as an educator where the--where the awards would be equal, and that's something I--I'm very proud of.  It, it never have been always about me, it's been, been always about what I can do for others, others, others as well, and that's something that, that I'm very, very excited about.

Speaker 1: When you talk about--is this--when you--you, you mentioned wood and steel, is this when you started working with those mediums?
Speaker 2: Now, I was just--I was just primarily--I was working flat then.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, and in '94 [1994], I discovered that the--that the wood would bend.  A friend of mine, Tony Lotehote [ph.] who was teaching at Tri-City [Tri-Cities High School, East Point, Georgia], he was teaching sculpture.  She told me--he, he told me about this bendable plywood.  But in the meantime, I've always felt, you know, in the--in the African culture, it is said, "Whatever you do should--the, the medium you use should depict what you're trying to say."  The medium you--the medium you use should depict what you're trying to say.  And the wood was symbolic to number one, the trees that African Americans hung from, okay, and then I'll, I'll talk about later what the--what the aluminum is about and what the copper is about.
Speaker 1: So, how, how does the process work with bending wood?
Speaker 2: Well, the bending wood, it's easy.  It--it's called a bendable Lauan.  You, you can buy it and it's used to hang the arched, arched ceilings with, the new home, it would have an arched ceiling, that's what it's used for.  And what I do with it, I take it--it's, it's designed to bend one way.  I put a heavy gel medium on it.  And when I put the--put the medium on it, it give this flexibility.  But if you notice with all my pieces that I do, everything starts, starts with a knot.  That knot is symbolic to a noose, a noose, a knot.  And, and, you know, and when--and the series I'm doing now is my warrior series, and it just hang.  Now, some people say, well, I'll never forget I was at Preston [ph.] (unclear) judging the AP [advanced placement] portfolios, and this one professor said, "These are angry--they're joyful pieces but they're also angry pieces."  I said, "Good, you got it," (laughter).
Story_ID: 361118
Speaker 1: So, what happens--you, you were at Tri-City [Tri-Cities High School, East Point, Georgia] from--
Speaker 2: From 1990--
Speaker 1: Ninety [1990] to ninety-four [1994].
Speaker 2: --to '94 [1994].  Well, in 1994, and then I was represented by the, the, the McIntosh Gallery here, here in Atlanta [Georgia], which I always tell the story that she, she, she had some of the top African American artists in the country.  She gave Romare Bearden his first show.  She gave Benny Andrews his first one and gave John Scott [John T. Scott].  And I was represented by her.  And when, when the--when The Coca-Cola Company [Atlanta, Georgia] became official sponsor of the Olympics [1996 Summer Olympics, Atlanta, Georgia], they kept asking, who's able to do large scale pieces of artwork?  My name kept coming up.  And another guy knew her from Coke, said, you know what?  Her name is Louisa [Louisa McIntosh Edwards], Louisa, can we talk to this guy?  They came over and they--and they talked to me about, about, about, you know, about they wanted to do.  And they told me the artists they looked at.  So, she and I talked.  I said, well, you know what?  I think that they are just interviewing me as a part of the process because--and, and, and because I'm black.  So I went on, I started to do--I said, well, you know, I really wanna--I really wanna do something for the Olympics.  And how you do a 15 story mural, you never touch the wall, they give you what you ask for, and I came in, I, I--my--I said, I, I know what I'm gonna do.  I'm gonna do it on--I'm gonna do it on a--I'm gonna do it on like a vinyl, came in with my presentation.  I said, gentleman, how many days you--well, you gotta look at it--now, if you want somebody to get this mural done by the time of the Olympics, how many days--I'm looking at how many days it rained from 1990 'til 1994, how many days it was over 40 degrees, how many days it was under 80 degrees, how many days it snowed, how many miles an hour that the wind is going one way.  If a person is trying to paint this on a wall that--on a scaffold painting, they would never get it done.  Let me--let me introduce you to a vinyl.  The vinyl lasts, lasts between seven and ten years.  It'll be--it'll be done in sections.  I found a company, company that can install it in.  I want this, I want this, I want this.  I'm gonna use this, I'm gonna use this, I'm gonna use that.  I also wanna hire five of my former students, part of the deal, and if you look in the--look in the lower right-hand corner, everything is copyrighted.  I would love to hear from you soon.  I got the project.
Speaker 1: Wow.  And where does this mural hang?
Speaker 2: It was on the side of, of--it was on the side of a building called Carter Hall, which was the dormitory for Clark Atlanta University [Atlanta, Georgia] students, Georgia State [Georgia State University, Atlanta, Georgia] students.  And it took two years, six months, seventeen days, fourteen hours, and thirty-two minutes.  I kept a diary on it.  It was--it was--it was one them--one of them--matter of fact, the--it, it was--it was 8200 square feet, bigger than the Sistine Chapel [Apostolic Palace, Vatican City] and which was--which was 7700 square feet, okay?  It was one of the largest single-hand projects for any Olympics done, but it was done with the input of the community, whereas the idea was to, to paint the unsung heroes.  Then, I used some of my former students.  I brought in two artists from the community who I knew to just give them the experience of doing it.
Story_ID: 361119
Speaker 1: Who were some of the unsung heroes that was--
Speaker 2: Oh, I can tell you.  You had--let me go from left to right.  You had Christine Farris [HistoryMaker Christine King Farris] who was the--who was the--who was the sister of Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.].  You had oh, so many people I could name, Dr. Walter Kimbrough [Walter L. Kimbrough], pastor of the Cascade Methodist Church [Cascade United Methodist Church, Atlanta, Georgia].  I knew--I knew everybody's story.  I knew every hair on their head (laughter).  I knew every--you know, who wanted to look good, who wanted to look--and you had Dr. Goldstein who's the owner of the Best Western Hotel [American Hotel; Best Western American Hotel, Atlanta, Georgia], Dr. Marvin Goldstein [Marvin C. Goldstein], and his story.  I'll never forget his story was when he built the, the Best Western, he didn't--he didn't wanna have a separate hotel fountain, so he chose not to have any in there, okay?  I gotta tell you this story about Dr. Goldstein.  Dr. Goldstein, when I was painting his portrait, he, he wanted to be--you know, however you wanted to look, I can make you look, okay.  You wanted more gray, you don't want no gray at all, whatever.  Dr. Goldstein wanted me to take, take all the wrinkles out of his neck, right?  So meantime, he said, I'll tell you what, since you did that, I wanna give you a free weekend at, at my hotel.  So, I go in and I, I had been seeing, seeing--I had been seeing this young lady, we never had time, to spend time, and later on she became my wife.  So, anyway, so I said, I'll tell you what, I'm (unclear) now--I was having shows, too, 'cause every time I paint a group of faces, there was travel.  So I said, I'll tell you what, when, when I get back to town, I wanna--maybe we can spend one weekend downtown.  So, I'm getting ready to check in, I'm with her.  So, I go in and I say, a room for [HistoryMaker] Kevin Cole.  The lady looks, she can't find that.  So I said, okay, I'm not gonna be embarrassed like that, I said is the manager here?  Manager came out, I forget, forget her name.  She said, oh, Kevin, okay.  That's fine.  Oh, we have you on the top floor.  We had a room at the penthouse.  And my wife asked me, she said, well, is this what you do?  I said, baby, I live like this all the time (laughter).
Speaker 1: Well, what is your wife's name?
Speaker 2: Karen, Karen, Karen [Karen Johnson Cole].
Speaker 1: And when did you get married?
Speaker 2: We got married in, in 2000.
Speaker 1: In 2000, okay.  And let me ask you again, the--your agent at that time or the gallery, Louisa--what was her name (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, Louisa McIntosh [Louisa McIntosh Edwards].
Story_ID: 361120
Speaker 1: You do the painting for the Olympics [1996 Summer Olympics, Atlanta, Georgia], so tell me now what happens next.
Speaker 2: Next, I, I wanted to--I needed about--I needed another year to do--to have ten years in with school system.  Then, I could go ahead and decide what I was gonna do.  So I had options to go to New York, option to go here, there.  So, North Springs High School [North Springs Charter High School, Sandy Springs, Georgia] was trying to start a visual arts magnet program, and they called me.  And the principal, Dr. Ralph Lynch was there.  They went on to tell me how they--how they wanted to guide--to do a magnet program on the--on the north side, and I took it.  I started the advanced placement program there where 95 percent of my kids passed the advancement placement test.  Advanced placement is where you take a college course in high school, and you--if you make a--if you make a certain score, you pass.  Then, then the department grew from one teacher, me, to four teachers.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And after--then, in nineteen--well, in 2004, I left North Springs.  I wanted more of a challenge.  I wanted to start another, another program.  I wanted to come back on the south side.  And I came--and then I came to Westlake High School [Atlanta, Georgia].
Speaker 1: Okay.  And did you choose Westlake for a particular reason?
Speaker 2: Yes, because Westlake had never had a thriving art program and was really based on its principal.  His name was Darren Franklin who wanted to take the arts and make the arts a avenue for everything else whereas he, he was under philosophy of what Bill Gates was trying, trying to do out in--out in San Francisco [California] where, where the arts will become a pioneer for, for reading, writing, and everything else.  And that's what Darren Franklin's idea was.  And, and when he heard that I was getting ready--I wanted to leave North Springs, Dr. Dorothy Honor [ph.] was already there, and Dorothy told him and she said, you know, "Kevin [HistoryMaker Kevin Cole] would be a great fit here."  So, I've been there and then we got--we ended up getting--he went--he transferred to a middle school and now we have Sandra Irving who has been a pioneer for--I mean, she's, she's, she's changed programs around the state, and she's a big advocate for the arts.  And she's real big on data.  I mean, she, she does research on data, on what data says should happen.  And she's a big--a big arts fan.  And she, she--and she wants to make West- see, Westlake is--Westlake is a math/science program.  What she want to happen, to be a, a visual/performing arts and math/science.  So, when she became principal, I applied for chairmanship of the art department and she gave me that, and now we're in the process of combining the two.  And she's--and she's a big fan of the arts.  But she--not only that, she's a--she's a hard worker.  And, you know, when you look at what's happening on the south side, there's--there, there--there's a renaissance that's happening.  Test scores are gonna have to improve because you look at the cascade area, what you have are those like million dollar houses are going up, so the property value as well as the school system.  So she's a component of test scores.  Now, she was--now, one thing I, I can say, is she'll work the hell out you, but she works.  And that's, that's one thing--that's one thing I like about her.  But I'm not sure how long I'm gonna be at Westlake, to tell you the truth.  I mean, I'm getting other offers, but, right now, I wanna build one more program.
Story_ID: 361121
Speaker 1: Okay.  We were talking about Westlake High School [Atlanta, Georgia] and you were saying you don't know how much longer you're gonna be there 'cause, you know, you're getting more offers.
Speaker 2: Well, well, well--it--it's not just getting more offers, it's just the idea of what I wanna do is to start another magnet program.  'Cause, you know, my thing is, I've been able to build two successful magnet programs, so I have two young guys who are dynamite, Shaun Haynes [ph.] and, and George Gabarith [ph.].  We wanna pass it on.  And right now it's a battle between my career as an artist going very, very well.  I don't think I'll ever stop teaching.  I'm gonna always do that, but I'm excited to have a principal who finally can see my vision in terms of the arts being a catalyst for everything else.  That's what I'm, I'm, I'm very, very, very excited about, too.  But, you know, when you--you know, as you get older, people start to see what you can do, and my career as an artist is very important.  I mean, so, I, I gotta figure out just what I'm gonna do in the next five or in the next three to five years and where I wanna go and really, really pray about it, tell you the truth (laughter).
Story_ID: 361122
Speaker 1: When you were starting out as an artist, I'm sure there were artists that you looked up to besides your professors and now you're at the point where your work is being shown alongside of theirs.  Is that right?
Speaker 2: That's correct.
Speaker 1: So, let's, let's talk about how that makes you feel and who some of these artists are.
Speaker 2: It's--it, it, it is so exciting and it's like, one thing because my work is based on a lot of my, my spirituality.  And when--spirituality, I mean, you know, I title some of my pieces like I did--I'm doing a piece called "The Battle at Jericho" [ph.] that is fragmented pieces.  And now, the, the new work as I said is based on September 11th [September 11, 2001 (9/11)], Hurricane Katrina.  And when you look at some of these artists, I can--I can say [HistoryMaker] Sam Gilliam is one, again, John T. Scott who handles every medium to the max.  John is one--I mean, he--I went to his show in New Orleans [Louisiana], and I was just amazed how somebody can handle every--he did printmaking, he did sculpture, he did paintings, he did wax relief, he did blown glass, handles superb.  So he's, he's one.  Frank Stella, I don't discriminate.  Frank, Frank Herrmann, the way he handles textures.  He uses artifacts of African cultures and, you know, things of that nature.  I can go on.  The, the list is endless.
Speaker 1: What about Benny Andrews?
Speaker 2: Benny is a big factor because I met Benny when I was thirteen, thirteen years old at the Arkansas Art Center [Little Rock, Arkansas].  And I'll tell you a story about Benny.  It's--and I, I get mad and then I'm glad, too.  Benny just--unfortunately, he just passed away.  But Benny and I, along with Larry Walker, who was the director of Georgia State University [Atlanta, Georgia] who I'm--who I'm very much influenced by as a mentor, who got me along my way in terms of teaching and what I should do, and he's Kara--he's Kara Walker's father.  To make a long story short, there was a show at (unclear) entitled 'Three Georgia Artists.'  I'm down there with Benny and we're all talking and doing lectures and Benny talked, I talked.  So, Benny says to me, "I like your work, I'd like to buy one and I'd like to trade one with you."  I'm like, "No."  Stupid me, I didn't wanna trade.  I did a big black and white drawing.  It was--and I, I, I was--they were--they were these beautiful drawings.  So I'm sitting there--so, anyway, I could've--I could've kicked myself because later on, Benny introduced me to Louisa McIntosh [Louisa McIntosh Edwards] who got me commissioned for the Olympics [1996 Summer Olympics, Atlanta, Georgia], so Benny introduced me to her.  And, and then--and then when I told Louisa, she said, "Benny don't like trading with nobody."  So, anyway, that was like, stupid me.  So, go on and on.  This past April, Benny and I were a part of a show at the--at the Museum of Contemporary Art of Georgia [Atlanta, Georgia]; MOCA, GA.  We're sitting there talking and, and Benny, Benny said to me again, "You know, Kevin [HistoryMaker Kevin Cole], I see your stuff everywhere.  I, I wanna buy one, but I don't know if I can afford, but let's trade."  I said, "Fine."  So, so Benny says, "I'm gonna be in New Orleans for whatever, for three weeks."  I come--so when--that third week, I, I, I said, "Benny, two pieces, right?" Benny sends me back--now mind you, my wife [Karen Johnson Cole] and I had just moved into the house.  She tells me, "We can't buy nothing, okay."  Okay, by now--Benny send me back a line drawing and, and a collage.  The box comes in the mail and I said--I said--I said, hey--I said, "Karen, when we--you know, then they come in the mail."  She kept saying, "Okay, yeah, you, you got something from Benny."  She opened this and--, "You, you must've bought these."  I said, "I didn't buy anything."  "You must've bought these.  He, he doesn't like you that much."  He sends me a line drawing and a collage.  The line drawing appraised in retail value between four and six thousand [dollars], the collage between fifteen and twenty.  Of course, I called him and I thanked him, and he told her I, I didn't buy it, so--but, no, but Benny had always--and, and Benny was the one that told me in terms of getting into, into a gallery, "There's a front door, a back door, the, the side door.  Front door where you come in and you show your work and they tell you no.  The side door is where you get introduced by an artist or somebody introduce you to the gallery, and the back door is where--is where--is where they discover you."  He said, "Your best bet is that side door, when somebody has introduce--make the introduction for you and they bring you in."
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: I will never forget that in my life.
Speaker 1: That's wonderful.  So, now, what's gonna happen next?  I mean, you're, you're still teaching at the school [Westlake High School, Atlanta, Georgia], and you have your sights on trying to start a--another magnet school and focusing on your, your new works--
Speaker 2: Right (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) that are coming out.
Story_ID: 361123
Speaker 1: Okay, so, let's just talk about, about your work per se, about the content of your work before we go any further.
Speaker 2: Well, as I stated earlier, the content right now is dealing with two things--well, well, well, actually three--well, let's say five.
Speaker 1: Five (laughter).
Speaker 2: They're, they're still there.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: The story my--the story that my [paternal] grandfather [Sam Cole, Sr.] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Grandfather.
Speaker 2: --told me, number two, the relationship between site, sound, and color. Number three, September 11th [September 11, 2001 (9/11)].
Speaker 1: 11th.
Speaker 2: Number four, we're dealing with the whole idea of Katrina [Hurricane Katrina] and my experience as an artist, educator, and a father.  And when I say my, my grandfather's story, when he told me to go stand beside this tree, told me that African Americans had been lynched by their neck ties on their way to, to vote.  So I use the--I use rods in my work 'cause they're like a cane and they, they symbolize.  And some people say the, the rods are symbolic to Moses.  I know my kids at, at North Springs [North Springs High School; North Springs Charter High School, Sandy Springs, Georgia] used to call me Moses because Moses stuttered, he had a speech impediment, so it was funny.  And so when I say relationship between site, sound, and color, I listen to music as I work and I use a lot of African patterns to show their movement and, and, and rhythm in my work, okay.  And, September 11th, that--I was supposed to be in New York [New York] that day.  I was supposed to go with a friend of mine by the name of Eric Mack to look at some galleries.  I didn't go.  And when I saw it on TV, I was just devastated.  And a friend of mine by the name of Bill Stevens, he was there, and Bill--while Bill was there, Bill took a picture of a little boy holding a piece of tar paper and a piece of steel, so I started working on tar paper and aluminum, which is similar to steel that, that was symbolizing my protest against what happened on September 11th.  They were mediums that I could maneuver and bend like I wanted to like wood. And then, I started working on copper.  Peter Jennings, I used to love to watch Peter Jennings on the seven o'clock news.  I'd get home in time to watch him.  And Peter Jennings did a segment on the survival, the, the spouses that are survived--the spouses that were--who had--the spouses who had husbands that were killed or wives that were killed on September 11th.  There was this one lady on and she was talking, she said that it cost the government--I mean, there were over 1,006 remains from September 11th.  "It would only cost the government pennies to find out who they were."  And she said, "You know what?  But by me being a Christian, one day when Gabriel blows his horn, I'll see my husband again," so I started working on copper, and that's what--that's what I did, the copper came from.  'Cause, you know, copper is--copper is, is, is like a penny.  And this last series I've been working on is--I call it my warrior series, and, and those are the pieces behind me.  They are based on Maynard Jackson.  And I had a chance--I, I knew Maynard and when he gave me my first commission I talked about earlier.  I met him when I was painting this--his portrait for the Olympics [1996 Summer Olympics, Atlanta, Georgia] to go on the wall.  And with the Coke [The Coca-Cola Company, Atlanta, Georgia] project, everybody who was selected to be a part of the project, they had to go through an extensive interview.  And that interview entailed questions.  This one, one young lady, she was in high school, I guess, and she asked Maynard, "What did he--what did he want his legacy to be?"  And Maynard looked at her and said, "You know what?  I've always lived by a poem that was entitled 'When I Die, Would it Matter if I was Ever Born' [ph.]."  I think it was Margaret Walker, 'When I Die Would it Matter if I was Ever Born.'  And that stayed on my mind.  So the pieces that the rods are going at an angle is more of a warrior.  And, and if you know Maynard, Maynard, Maynard was a warrior, so that's what I'm--what I'm working on right now.
Story_ID: 361124
Speaker 1: Because you work in education, what would your message to the future generations be?
Speaker 2: Right now, I have something I tell my kids every day is that you learn through a process of doing.  No excuses.  Excuses are like behinds, everybody got one.  And at the same time, like I said, the--Bob--the late Robert Woodruff [Robert W. Woodruff] said, "There's no limit on what a man can do or where he can go if he doesn't mind who gets--who gets the credit."  That would be the, the statement I would--I would--I would leave with them.  Because the fact that, you know, everybody--it's, it's about me, but you gotta carry somebody with you.  It's like the each one, teach one (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Teach one.
Speaker 2: But, but you gotta carry somebody with you.  Nobody gets where they are alone.  We all are standing on somebody else's back.  I know I'm standing--and the first thing I did, Jacob Lawrence, when I met Jacob Lawrence, I said, "Thank you."  When I met--when I met Romare Bearden, I said "Thank you."  And when I met [HistoryMaker] Sam Gilliam, I hugged him and I said, "Thank you," because Sam was one of the few black abstract painters off the canvas.  I hugged him and I said, "Thank you."  And he asked me--he laughed--I said--I just said, "Thank you for paving the way for me."  And Sam kept saying, "Now, who--what are you gonna do for somebody else?"
Story_ID: 361125
Speaker 1: Well, as a educator, what are your concerns for the African American community?
Speaker 2: Just the, the basics, reading, writing, and math, you know, thinking outside the box.  My concern is I think we're putting too much emphasis, I hate to say, on the sciences, on computers, and not, not dealing with problem-solving.  I'll never forget, I was at Princeton University [Princeton, New Jersey], Bill Gates said, one of his questions that he asked himself, is "Why is the manhole round?"  He said graduates from Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] can never give him an intelligent answer, graduates from Yale [Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut].  He said, it's always those arts people, who give them an intelligent answer that our bodies are round.  You get your--you know, it comes--you get your head through, you get your--you get your body through.  But graduates from, from Yale and Princeton, they never answer in an intelligent way.  And I--and, and we're not letting people be themselves.  Okay, OutKast, they were at Tri-City [Tri-Cities High School, East Point, Georgia] when I was at Tri-Cities.  They'll tell you, people counted, counted, counted them out.  They weren't thinking outside the box.  The arts allow you to think outside the box.  And the arts--the arts are the only thing gonna save, save education.  Say it again, "The arts are gonna be the only thing that save education."  And even with the iPods, those things are part of the arts.  They're thinking out--they're thinking outside the box, problem-solving.
Speaker 1: What do you think about art and music coming together?
Speaker 2: Both of them.  It's a--I'm saying the arts in general.  I'm talking about art, dance, I'm talking about music.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I always say about--you know, I tell my kids, I say--when people say, why can't you draw?  Miles Davis, he didn't come out of his, his mother's womb playing a trumpet.  He was taught.  You can teach a person how to--how to do art.  I can teach you how to draw.  I, I strongly believe that.  One thing we do in our--in my--in my, my school is, the first day of class, we get a sheet of paper and we tell you to just draw this still life.  We put that beside the piece you do at the end of the semester, 100 percent improvement.  But then it's problem-solving, it's thinking how you go from this line, okay, how, how, how do I know your shape of your head is--the--your--the shape of your head is a oval shape, but you--but, but you learn that.  And the way we teach is that you learn things.  You don't memorize, you learn them.  So when you learn it, you can always show it to somebody else.  But I think that's what the arts--the arts--I mean--I mean, the, the--I, I know the chorus teachers, the drama teachers at my school, we all sit there and we talk about, wow, you know.  And, but, but one thing I like about my principal, she knows the arts are gonna be the thing that take her out of--that, that will get her high test scores, that problem-solving, creativity.
Story_ID: 361126
Speaker 1: So you, you believe, though, that, that the arts will take students higher.  What do you feel about them trying to do away with some of the arts in the schools?
Speaker 2: You know, I, I stumbling--I don't understand it because you think about art and you think about PE [physical education], you need physical fitness.  If you--if you not healthy, you not gonna learn.  I'm very disappointed in it, like everybody else.  We know it's like--but then they'll come back and say--you know, like, okay, with everything, scientific, medical, okay, that's a--cancer.  Everything cause cancer now.  You can't eat no eggs, you can't, you know (laughter)--you know, everything you eat, it cause cancer.  So, now, you know, they'll come back and, and, and they will--they will see that the arts are very important.  But then the research has shown how important the arts are.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, and I, I think it's gonna--it's gonna come back, back again.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, I hope that you are a part of that, that system that brings it back with the--your new program and magnet school since you've been so successful with the other two.

Speaker 1: How do you want to be remembered?  I mean, I, I--we know about your--well, well, you can tell me both.  What do you actually want your legacy to be?  Even though you're so young, you've already started a legacy.  So, I guess maybe, how do you want to be remembered?
Speaker 2: Well, first of all, I'd like to be remembered as a good husband and a good father.  Then, I like the statement that Maynard [Maynard Jackson] said, "When I die, would it matter if I was ever born?"  I wanna make a difference.  And, you know--and I, I think with me, the things that we--you know, I talk about it with my, my parents [Jessie McGlounce Cole and Sam Cole, Jr.], my mom sometime is being able to wake up in the morning time and do what I like doing.  I like teaching and I like my art.  I, I leave--I tell people, "Teaching was my job."  I mean, "Teaching was something I like.  Now, now I go to--I, I go--I come home to my job."  I come down here, I'm able to work in my studio.  The joy of doing that is--there is nothing like it.
Story_ID: 361128
Speaker 1: I mean, it's really a joy for you to do your work, but it's also important that you know who is acquiring your art.  Who are some of the people that are collecting your art today?
Speaker 2: I've been fortunate that Yale University Art Gallery [New Haven, Connecticut] Dr. Bob Steele, who has a wonderful collection, he, he, he made that happen, Michael Jordan.  I could go on, Bernard King, Rod Strickland, The Coca-Cola Company [Atlanta, Georgia], IBM [International Business Machines Corporation] in White Plains in, in, in New York, Bank of America.  I have over 750 public and private art, art collectors that I know of that, that have at least two Kevin Coles [HistoryMaker Kevin Cole] or more.  And Darrell Walker made it happen with Michael Jordan.  He was a teammate of Michael Jordan.  He made sure that other basketball players, they were buying.  And the, the most fascinating one right now is [HistoryMaker] Oscar Robertson, "The Big O."  When he and his wife bought a piece of mine for Christmas, as a Christmas present for themselves, that was--that was exciting.  And, you know, and it's not that--just them, but the common everyday person that come in and say, you know, I like this, you know.  And, the, the--and the comments you get behind the work.  You know, I see this, I see that.  I mean, that's the joy, but then when the Fortune 500 companies buy it and a lot of the museums, Philadelphia Academy of Fine Art [sic. Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], Greg, Greg, Greg Head who's the owner of HEADFIRST market and research firm [HEADFIRST Insights and Strategy], who's one of my biggest collectors here in Atlanta [Georgia].  Maria Campbell who, who works for S.C. Johnson [S.C. Johnson and Son, Inc.]; she own more Kevin Coles than anybody, each one from a different style.  So, you know, that idea of them buying it and their buying a piece of themselves--I mean, their buying a piece of me and making a--making it a part of them.  And I'll never forget that Greg Head said he walks in--he walks in some time and, and he go, "Wow," you know.  The piece I did about he and his wife, Yolanda [Yolanda Head], it was a--it was a portrait--it was like a self-portrait but it was done my way and there, you have their wedding invitation hanging from one of the neck ties, you know, incorporated within the work and you all never see it, a lot of marks in the--in the piece that, that, that the day they met is in the piece.  The numbers that they like are in the piece.  I'm doing a piece for Jim Scott and his family.  Each one of the--each one of the, the pieces are gonna be about him and his son.  So, you know, you--you know, that--and then--and then when you walk in someone's house and see it, that's the thing, "Okay, yeah, okay I did that."  And at the end of the day, I always think about what, what my [paternal] grandfather [Sam Cole, Sr.] was saying.  "You know what?  They bought that.  That's a part of you."

Speaker 1: You have how many children?
Speaker 2: Two.
Speaker 1: Tell me their names.
Speaker 2: Skyler [Skyler Cole] and Nia [Nia Cole].
Speaker 1: Are they artistic?
Speaker 2: Skyler--both of them are, but I think my daughter, Nia, is gonna be the one 'cause she wants to be, be an artist already.  She comes down with dad in the studio.  My son, Skyler, he's, he's thirteen, he'll be fourteen in a couple of weeks.  He likes art, but I think with him, he's seen a lot of the, the part that goes with it 'cause he--'cause he was with his dad when his dad was, you know, he was carrying him from place to place and, and I had an old studio and it was cold there and I have a heater around him and put him in his little cradle, and when he cry, I pulled the string (laughter) you know, while I was painting, you know (laughter), okay whereas I think with--I think with Nia, Nia is enjoying it as well.  But she is the more creative side.  She talks a lot.  She, "Okay, well, daddy, what about this?"  And she come downstairs and I think she'll be the--I think she's gonna be the artist.
Speaker 1: Great.
Speaker 2: And which I don't want, I don't want.  Because I, I think it's--I think it's a hard thing when you gotta, you know, follow, follow behind somebody.  I'm gonna do--if, if she wants to do it, I'll be happy for her, but, you know, I don't--I don't push it.

Speaker 1: This is a, a faculty exhibition, was done in 1980.  The guy in the lower left-hand corner is Henri, Henri Linton, who ended up being the chairman of the art department at the University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff [Pine Bluff, Arkansas].  He was one of--he was one of my, my mentors there.  He's, he's, he's primarily a landscape painter.  And he was the one that, that always, always made sure that you had--you know, you were doing the right thing.  And it was kind of funny, we always talk about it, we call him Poppa Lin 'cause he was always, always, always there to make sure everything was being done properly.  And the guy--the guy in the center on the left is Ernest Davidson who just passed away, was a--was a good mentor.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): Denise [Denise Gines], can you straighten it.  You're listing to one--it--it's not upright, straight.  There--now you're going the other way.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): Oh.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): Okay, we're on Davidson, go ahead.
Speaker 1: Okay, Ernest Davidson who, who, who recently passed away.  He was a--he, he was a--he was a dynamite sculptor and ceramic artist, which went to school at, at Syracuse [Syracuse University, Syracuse, New York].  He got his master's degree.  And every National Black Arts Festival, he would be here--he would be, be here with us.  He--recently, he completed a lamp of my son and I, did, did the face of my son and I and we were planning for him to do my daughter's face.  But he was--he was one of the guys that was very, very influential in me coming to Arkansas, Pine Bluff [University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff, Pine Bluff, Arkansas], and, and influential in me staying between that barrier of a sculptor and a painter.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): Okay.
Speaker 1: And, and the guy at the top is the late John Howard who was the chairman of the department and who studied with Hale Woodruff, part of the Harlem Renaissance period.  And, and Mr. Howard was, was important to a lot of African American artists as well as white artists in, in, in Arkansas.  He influenced--he influenced a lot of us.  And I'll never forget when I came there with my scholarship, Mr. Howard said to me, he said you know what?  If you stick with Corbin, Davidson, and Lin [Henri Linton], you can do anything that you wanna do, and I found, found, found that to be true.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): Okay.  And we'll go to Corbin.
Speaker 1: And Tarrance Corbin who's, who's, who's like a father and a, a mentor to me, had been that way for years.  We talk at least two times a week.  Matter of fact, he was the one that talked me into going to graduate school.  I didn't know what graduate school was.  He's, he's been there, I mean, for me.  He's, he's a dynamite painter, does, does large scale pieces.  And the way that I learned, learned--I learned to do murals was I learned how to do, do murals because I worked for him.  He was doing these big three hundred inch paintings and I would come in and block--and color, block, and shape.  And he taught me all about art and art history.  And my knowledge for art history, I gotta give him credit for and he's just been there for me all the time, and, and he still is.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): Okay.  That's good, right?
Speaker 1: Yep.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): Okay.  That's good, Denise, thanks.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): Okay, description for this one, please.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  This is my lovely family.  This is--this is my wife, Karen [Karen Johnson Cole], my daughter, Nia [Nia Cole], and my son, Skyler [Skyler Cole].  Nia means life with a purpose, Skyler means looking toward the heavens.  This is my pride and joy that I work hard for and that I enjoy and also a big inspiration in my life.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): Very good, next.
Speaker 2: This is a photograph of me in 19--oh, 1979.  I won second prize in the student show.  As you, you can see, I'm a lot slimmer (laughter), but it was one of the--it was a student show in which I was excited--I was excited about because I was only, only a sophomore winning one of the top prizes.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): Hold on, please.  Okay, great, next.  Go ahead.
Speaker 2: This is my graduation picture from the University of Arkansas Pine Bluff.  I graduated cum laude.  I always say thank you, thank you, thank you, Lordy (laughter) (unclear).  My--it's, it's my momma [Jessie McGlounce Cole], momma and my sister Sammia [Sammia Cole Thomas] who, who are both--who are both a major part of my life now, and this was at University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): Very good, next.  Okay, go ahead.
Speaker 2: And this--and this is a shot of my, my mom.  The painting above her is, is one I did in the backyard.  It's above her head with these, these cinder blocks.  And my mom was, was very influential in my life and she still is, fortunate to have her as, as like a--as like a pillar of hope.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): Okay.  When was this taken?
Speaker 2: This was taken in 19--must--probably 1979.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): Okay, next.  Go ahead.
Speaker 2: And, and this is my sister Sammia who's, who's a major part of my life, I talk to at least almost every day.  She's the one that really keeps me--keeps me going and keeps me grounded in terms of my career, in terms of the things I'm doing.  She's, she's one of the few family members who've acquired a lot of my artwork.  We always talk about life in general and, and where we're going.  But, she's also a major part of my life.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): Great, next.  Go ahead.
Speaker 2: This is a piece I did when I was in graduate school, was part of my graduate thesis show.  It's entitled "The Dancing Jacket" [ph.] and it was a part of the show, 'Have You Checked the Closet?' [ph.].  And you can see all the detail and, and the realism in the work.  It was done while I was in graduate school at Northern Illinois University [DeKalb, Illinois].
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): This is one of the pieces when the man bought the whole wall?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, who bought the whole show.  This is one of the pieces where the--where Charles Price [ph.] ended up buying the whole show.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): Good, next.  Any time you're ready.
Speaker 2: When I first came to Camp Creek Middle School [College Park, Georgia], being involved in art was important but I also coached--I coached the basketball team, and the first year, we went, went to the final.  And a lot of these students, they were very, very, very good artists and I always attribute their knowledge of arts as being a part of their knowledge to play basketball on the court.  And we made it to the finalists in, in middle school, at Camp Creek Middle School.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): Okay.  Year?
Speaker 2: Nineteen eighty--nineteen eighty--
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): Roughly.
