Speaker 1: All right, my name is Larry Crowe.  I'm interviewer today with The HistoryMakers.  Our videographer is Matthew Hickey.  Sir, can you please state your full name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: Sure.  My full name is [HistoryMaker] A C Wharton, Jr., A actually is the first name; C is the middle name, no periods, Wharton, W-H-A-R-T-O-N, Jr.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, like, now this is un- is, isn't that unusual, though it sounds strange to those who are unfamiliar with it.  But, but it's, I guess, would, would you say it's a southern practice or a black American practice to just have the initials?
Speaker 2: They use the initials as a full name--I found to be basically a southern practice.  You'll note if you look at my name there are no periods.  It's an A, it's a C.  Now, I would imagine that on my birth certificate you may see periods.  But once I go to my first really good English teacher, and she, Ms. Cooper [ph.], and she said to me, "A period denotes an abbreviation.  If you've got that period there, that means the A stands for something."  So I sort of just did my unofficial name change and removed the periods because it does not stand for anything.  The, as the same was with my, my father [A.C. Wharton, Sr.].  Obviously, I'm A C, Jr.  As far as I can tell on the limited research that I found in a 'Black's Law Dictionary' [Henry Campbell Black], it used to be that being known as a Christian carried certain privileges, so you would not simply be Larry Crowe.  You would be, in order to distinguish yourself from the pagans, you would sign your name Larry Crowe, A C.  And then I would immediately say, you know, that's a good guy.  He is a Christian, so I wanna do business with him.  That's--and I don't know whether that's authoritative or not, but that's what (unclear) do (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, well, that, that may actually be the, you know, the--
Speaker 2: I know in my hometown there were a number of A Cs.  And it was not all uncommon for, if you were sharecropping on a white person's farm, plantation, or whatever.  And there a number of A Cs in the section of the state where I grew up.
Speaker 1: I grew with a O Z and an O.S., an O.S. Benjamin [O.S. Benjamin, Jr.]--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and an O Z Henton [ph.].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And one of--I know, well, neither one of is, you know, initials stood for a name.
Speaker 2: No, no, it was, it was quite common, caused me a lot of problems.  I never will forget when I enrolled in college [Tennessee Agricultural and Industrial State University; Tennessee State University, Nashville, Tennessee] Ms. Wheaton [ph.], the English teacher, literature teacher, said over and over again as she passed out the index cards so she could alphabetize them, she said clearly, "Do not use any initials, please no initials."  And then she gave this little talk, and she said, "This lesson is that you need to pay attention.  Just invariably, although I'm telling you five times do not use initials, someone's gonna turn in their index card, and they're gonna have initials."  So she started down the list: Alexander, no initials, good, Brown, Catchem, and all the way down.  And I think she was getting a little edgy, because by time she gets to the Ws and she said, "Didn't I tell you?  What, what did I tell you students?  What did I--somebody's gonna use the initials.  Here it is."  She'd gotten all the way to the Ws.  And I'm sitting back there in the corner looking like the class dummy.  And that's the kind of thing that I had to go through.  Checked into a hotel once way back in Boston [Massachusetts], this is ages ago.  Back then, particularly in New England, San Francisco [California] hotels are not air conditioned, not all the rooms.  I checked in.  I think they told me it was gonna be ten dollars a night, go to show you how old I am.  When I got ready to check out, they told me it was twelve dollars, and I said, "No, it was ten."  The lady said, "No, it was twelve."  I said, "No, ma'am, it was ten."  She said, "Let me just show you."  She said, "Here it is right here, A C."  I said, "Yes, ma'am, that's me."  She said, "No, you requested an air conditioned room."  "No, ma'am, that's my name."  So, so much on my name (laughter).  It's caused a lot of trouble.  The lesson is don't name your children A C.
Speaker 1: But it's distinctive though.  But it's probably--
Speaker 2: Ah, yeah, right.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  It's, it's distinctive, so.  And sir, what is your date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: I was born in Lebanon, Wilson County [Tennessee] on August 17th, 1944--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --Lebanon, Tennessee.  That's thirty miles east of Nashville [Tennessee] in the Cumberland Plateau.
Story_ID: 634043
Speaker 1: Oh, now, oh, I didn't ask you about, now, I read, I was reading about you, and I read that someone called you Bullet at some point.  Was that a nickname?
Speaker 2: Brother [HistoryMaker A C Wharton, Jr.].  I was called Brother.  I was called Rock Jaw and a whole bunch of things.  I was pretty fast on my feet, but Brother 'cause I was the first born male child.  It is a name, nickname.  Matter of fact, my sisters occasionally call me Brother now.  Now maybe somebody else called me Bullet, but it didn't stick.
Speaker 1: Okay, this is, this is--
Speaker 2: But--
Speaker 1: --the white man who told you to not to go to school.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, Bully, yes, yes, oh, oh.  You were saying Bullet.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Bully, B-U-L-L-Y.
Speaker 1: That's what he called you, okay, 'cause that--
Speaker 2: Yeah, Bully.
Speaker 1: --they, they printed it out as Bullet.
Speaker 2: No, it was Bully.  Let--
Speaker 1: Bully, okay.
Speaker 2: --yeah, let--
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: --yeah, let me, let me tell you how, how that happened, and just goes to show you how racist and derogatory that was.  It was always difficult in those days for a white person to give a black man or a black boy any of the honors, so they would always give us kind of a nickname like an animal, one of course was horse.  "What's up, horse?"  "What you doing, horse?"  Or, Bully, meaning a small bull, okay, anything other than a young man.  So, Bully was one of the other names that we were given.  And I never will recall this is--my daddy [A.C. Wharton, Sr.] worked for this man.  My daddy worked a whole bunch of jobs.  But I worked for this man.  He had a farm, pig farm, was located in a section of the town that was just nothing but rock.  And I would rake rocks all summer long and throw them in a sinkhole.  It'll rain, the rocks would come right back.  And it was getting toward the end of August, time to go back to school, and there were some fencing, and I also did painting for him, painting fence posts and things like that.  And there were some things that we hadn't got finished for the summer, and he wanted to get them finished.  So he said, "Bully, we'll just, we'll, we'll finish that up tomorrow."  And I said, "Ah, I can't do it tomorrow.  I have to go to school."  "You know, we'll finish tomorrow.  You can go to school anytime, you know."  So here I am, and this is a white man.  And where I was raised, when the white man spoke that was the law, particularly when your daddy worked for this white man too.  But I knew I needed to go to school.  I loved learning.  So I, I, I just didn't know what to do.
Story_ID: 634044
Speaker 1: But I'll, I'll never forget.  I can see my daddy [A.C. Wharton, Sr.] right now sitting right by the kitchen door, taking his shoes off.  And I finally got the nerve up, 'cause I was--I had to make a decision: was I gonna go to school, or was I gonna do what Mr. Tatum [ph.] told me to do?  So finally I just said, "Daddy, Mr. Tatum said I don't have to go to school tomorrow.  We got to finish those rocks--finish that fence."  And he said, "You just go with me tomorrow morning."  I didn't know what that meant.  So as opposed to walking to school with the other boys, I got in the car with daddy.  And we drove over to my daddy's place of work.  He also worked for this--for Mr. Tatum.  My daddy was a very mild man, never raised his voice.  But he went to Mr. Tatum.  I'll never forget that.  Mr. Tatum was sitting at his desk.  And my daddy said, "I understand you told Brother [HistoryMaker A C Wharton, Jr.] he didn't have to go to school tomorrow."  And he said, "Mr. Tatum," he said, "I work for you, and I'll do what you tell me to here on the job."  He said, "But when it comes to my house, I tell my children what to do.  He's going to school."  "Ah," he said, "I didn't mean no harm.  I didn't mean--I, I didn't mean any harm."  My daddy was a short man, but my daddy stood about ten feet tall.  It was just a load was lifted off of me because I was so afraid that that man was gonna fire my daddy, which would jeopardize my sisters, my little brother [Kenneth Wharton] all because of me running my big mouth.  But my daddy stood like a giant once he said that, didn't raise his voice, didn't curse, didn't make any threats, but he just stood up.  And it just seared indelibly in my mind the importance of education.  I just don't see how young folks can squander all these opportunities.  When my daddy just went way out there on a limb I mean, see, and if he had lost that job, see, he could have gotten blackballed because that man was well respected in the community.  And if the word got out, "That Wharton guy there has got a lot of mouth, uppity," or whatever.  I mean think of the pain and suffering that could have caused my family.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah, that's quite a story.
Story_ID: 634045
Speaker 1: So, let me go back to the just slating (laughter) and what we were doing.
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: But that's, that's, that's a good story.  I, I, I, when I read it I was moved by it.  Now, now, what is your title and occupation?
Speaker 2: My title is mayor of the City of Memphis, Tennessee.  By training and profession, I'm a lawyer, but I'm not practicing law now because serving as the mayor of America's nineteenth largest city is more than a full time job.
Speaker 1: All right.  And you've been mayor since 2009, but--
Speaker 2: That's correct.  I was elected to finish the unexpired term of my predecessor, Dr. W.W. Herenton, stayed until the elections in 2011, ran again, and I'm finishing up my first four year term.
Speaker 1: All right.  And what is today's date?
Speaker 2: Today's date is April 26th, 2014.
Speaker 1: And where are we at the present time?
Speaker 2: We're located in city hall, 125 North Mid America Mall on North Main [125 North Main Street, Memphis, Tennessee], on the seventh floor where my office is located.
Story_ID: 634046
Speaker 1: Before we go into depth, there are five lightweight questions that the office always asks me to ask people as a warm up--
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: --and not that we need it, but I'll ask them anyway.  They, they only require a short answer.  But the first question is, do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: Oatmeal.
Speaker 1: Okay, a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Blue, but oddly enough I'm colorblind, so my wife [Ruby R. Wharton] has to tell me and my assistants all--
Speaker 1: Really?  You can't--you, you can see blue, but you can't see other, other colors?
Speaker 2: It's my favorite color.  When I have something on--
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: --and I like it, and I'll say, what, what color?  And they'll say, "It's blue," so.  I, when I'm traveling, I, I, I dress in what I've worn, worn before, because my wife said this tie matches that, and that sock matches that, or, or whatever.  But if you were to ask me--I mean, I memorize.  I'll say--I'll, I'll tell you what--I, I know what this suit is.  I know the fact that someone has told me what it is.  But quite frankly, this could be a green pinstripe suit that I'm sitting in.  I hope not, but it could be.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, all right.  And let's see, favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Fall, fall and winter.
Speaker 1: Okay, favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Well, I'd have to say Memphis, Tennessee.  But since I have to answer your question I would say New York City [New York, New York].
Speaker 1: Okay.  And the last one is, do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: I, I really don't.  I have a favorite feeling or, or emotion, and that is, I mean, just be thankful what you have.  It can always be worse.  No matter how bad thing are, there's somebody in a worse situation.  And I always keep that in mind seldom if I ever slip into the dumps.  But when I do, I mean, I just say, "Hey, wait a minute.  Fellow, you think you got it rough.  What about that?"
Story_ID: 634047
Speaker 1: Okay, now, I'm gonna ask about your family history.  I'm gonna ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's side [A.C. Wharton, Sr.].  But we'll start with your mother's side first.  Can, can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: Sure, Mary, M-A-R-Y, of course, Alice Wharton, W-H-A-R-T-O-N.  Her maiden name would have been Seay, S-E-A-Y, Mary Alice Seay [Mary Seay Wharton].
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: September 6th, 1913 [sic. 1916].
Speaker 1: Okay.  And where was she born?
Speaker 2: Wilson County, Tennessee.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now is that the same county that--
Speaker 2: Lebanon [Tennessee] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) Lebanon is located.
Speaker 2: --is located, in right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She was raised and spent her early years in the eastern end of the county, near the Smith County [Tennessee] line.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, as far as you know, does her family have any other, look to any other point of origin, you know?
Speaker 2: No, no, I do not.  The, the, the Seay, the S-E-A-Y name, is really heavy in that area.  Now you will find many of them in the Flint, Michigan, Pontiac [Michigan] areas.  But by and large, they were all brought up right around Wilson County there.
Speaker 1: Are, are the ones in Flint and Pontiac re- related to the ones (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh yes.
Speaker 1: --in Tennessee?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  All right, now, how far back can you trace your mother's ancestors?
Speaker 2: Well, I, I remember her father [Frank Seay] and mother quite well, and just vaguely I remember my mother's grandmother.  And later on I'll tell you distinctly why I remember that.  But--
Speaker 1: So, so this is your great-grandmother?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Is that as far back as you can go, you think?
Speaker 2: Yes, that's as far as I could go be- I understand her name was, first name was Tennie, and her last name was Seay.  So she was Aunt Tennie Seay.  You can't forget that.
Speaker 1: Tennie Seay, really?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: How--
Speaker 2: Her first name was Tennie, and last name was S-E-A-Y.
Speaker 1: Now how do you spell the Tennie part?
Speaker 2: T-E-N-N-I-E.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now she was born, I guess she had been born like in the late 19th century, around 1870 (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: --or so.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Is that about right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, that's correct.
Speaker 1: Now she, was she born during the Civil War or--
Speaker 2: Oh, she probably would have been born--let's see--
Speaker 1: Or you think before?
Speaker 2: --you take my mother's mother, Dessie [Dessie Manning Seay], D-E-S-S-I-E, so yes, she would have been born, yes, probably 1850, somewhere in there, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Yeah, that's, that's--yeah, she's, yeah, I thought she would have been pretty close.  Is there a story behind that name?
Speaker 2: I, I, I don't know.  I, I, I, I really don't.  Now that you raised it I am going to inquire.
Speaker 1: Yeah, there, there's got to be a story.  And, and, but we just don't know what it is right now.
Speaker 2: My, my sister, who's filling out that family tree, that questionnaire, have y'all gotten it back yet?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: You did?  Okay.  Did she, is she reflected on there?  I'll, I'll let you take it and look at it later.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She, my sister, who I'll give you her contact information, she'll have all the answers.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, take a look.  So your, your grandmother's--so, is there any stories about Tennie Seay?
Speaker 2: No, not, not that I know of.  I just, just, just, my memories are just very vague.  Seeing her on her deathbed is all I remember.
Speaker 1: Now she would have been born--yeah, so she would have been born during slavery.
Speaker 2: Yes--
Speaker 1: And she would have (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) oh, absolutely.
Speaker 1: --been a, a child I guess when, when the Civil War was being fought.
Speaker 2: That's correct; that's correct.
Speaker 1: And so there are no--are there no stories in the family about what she saw or what, what it was like for her?
Speaker 2: My, my, my oldest sister, Mary [Mary Wharton Davis], who I want to--
Speaker 1: She knows it.
Speaker 2: Yeah, she will know.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Story_ID: 634048
Speaker 1: Now what about your [maternal] grandmother, Dessie [Dessie Manning Seay]?
Speaker 2: I remember her quite well because in the summer we, my family that is, would--my mother [Mary Seay Wharton] would take us up to the farm where she lived [in Wilson County, Tennessee] and help her do spring cleaning, summer cleaning.  And it was really fun to, to us to stay there, and to romp around the fields and all and play.  In her declining years she actually moved in with us.  You see, back then there were no nursing homes or hospice settings for African Americans, so my grandmother, Dessie Seay, was the first of my grandparents to come and live with us and actually die while living with us, so I got to know her quite well.  I suppose she had had a stroke.  And we, we were small kids, because this goes to show you it's good that God looks out for children, the innocence of children, because I remember running.  We would--I would chase my brother [Kenneth Wharton] through her room, and she would try to stop us, but because of the partial paralysis of the thought, she couldn't get her words out.  And of course that was fun to us.  I mean, we were just small kids, so.  I remember her quite, quite well.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  And what, what, what year was she born?
Speaker 2: I don't know what year she was born.  I can't even recall the year that she died.  I know I was just a small, small child.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I'm thinking probably in 1880, around 1880 or so--
Speaker 2: Yes, it would have to been around there somewhere--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --yeah--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --because my mother was born in '13 [sic. 1916], and I, I don't think--my, my mother was not the oldest child.  My mother was born in 1913, so my--her mother would have had at least been born in 1880 or some--no wait (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --she would have been like thirty-three I guess when--
Speaker 2: Right, right.  She may have been born--because folks got married much earlier.  It was quite common to get married at fourteen or fifteen or whatever, so it could have been even later than that.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's true; that's true.
Story_ID: 634049
Speaker 1: Now what, what about the grandfathers on those, you know, that side?  Do you know who your great-great-grandfather was?
Speaker 2: Frank Seay was my grandfather.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And his dad is named--oh, gee whiz, I have a picture in my office that I cannot recall.  I, I do not know his name.  I did not know my great-grandfather's name on the maternal side.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Any stories about him though, about--
Speaker 2: About my great-grandfather--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --or my grandfather?
Speaker 1: Well, either one, you know (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, oh, about my grandfather, yes, some.  Is this a family show that--?  (Laughter) There were, there, there's some I can't tell since this is a fam--
Speaker 1: Well, this is gonna be--this is, this is--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --history that your family will share, so--
Speaker 2: Share.  Let, let--
Speaker 1: --you can (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) let, let me tell you, yeah, Frank Seay was a real character, and they liked to call him warhorse.  He loved to run with the younger guys.  He was a good gambler, but he couldn't hold his liquor.  He would gamble and clean out the house.  But he had a habit of taking his winnings and placing them between his fingers, dollar bill here (gestures), simply a way to just aggravate the guys that he'd cleaned out.  And he'd have the money just sticking through his hands like this (gestures), just flaunting in their face.  But he couldn't hold his liquor, so they'd give him two or three drinks, and he'd go to sleep.  And of course they'd grab the money out his hands (laughter) while he was there.  And of course, he'd wake.  The other guys who stole the money were gone, but he'd just wake up and start fighting anybody there.  If you were there, you'd get hit.  And of course, he'd end up getting the short end of the stick.  Someone would bring him to our house late at night and basically dump him out like a sack of potatoes.  I recall those.  That really hurt me because my mother [Mary Seay Wharton]--my daddy [A.C. Wharton, Sr.] worked at night.  So my mother would have to get up and help drag him in the house and things like that.  That's why they called him warhorse.  He was out there in his oldest days.
Speaker 1: So he'd like to gamble and drink and fight.
Speaker 2: Gambling, oh yeah, gambling.  He liked to get around and, and, and watch the night lights.
Speaker 1: Now was he--did he, did he do farm work for a living (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh yes, yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I used to hear my mother tell it would very much hurt how seldom, if ever, did she and her siblings get to finish a complete school year in one place, because if you were a sharecropper, there was a lot of work.  You had to be responsible.  And my grandfather had a habit of leaving home on Friday evenings, going off to town and not showing up again until Monday morning.  You can't do that as a sharecropper.  So they would get evicted and have to move to another section of the county [Wilson County, Tennessee].  And that's why she seldom, if ever, was able to finish a complete year of school.  And if she did, it would be in more than one school.
Speaker 1: He was right there in the, you know, the same area though, right?
Speaker 2: Oh yes, yes, yeah.  He didn't run off or anything like that.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: But he was there.
Story_ID: 634050
Speaker 1: So your mother [Mary Seay Wharton] had--this was one of the trials of growing up, is moving because of your grandfather's [Frank Seay]--?
Speaker 2: Right.  And it was one thing that drove my mother and my father [A.C. Wharton, Sr.].  She told me just right up to her death about the vows that she and my dad took, that whatever it took, that they were going to educate the children.  And my mother just drilled that into me, that that was one of their first vows, right after the marital vows.  They were going to have children, and they were going to educate those children.  And when you look at what my parents did with my dad's third or fourth grade education and my mom's eighth grade education, it's nothing short of a miracle.  My--I will never own as much real estate as my parents have owned.  They became very astute in managing their personal and business affairs.  And they would look at what they had accomplished with such a meager amount, the formal education, and just say my what, what in the world can our children accomplish if we give them a full education?  And did just that.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So your mother, she was able to get to the eighth grade?
Speaker 2: Eighth grade is what--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --I recall, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And now does your mother, did, did she have any special, special aspirations for herself or any special talents that she--
Speaker 2: Yes.  In one of the unfulfilled dreams of my mother, was to become a licensed barber.  And she always cut hair, but I guess maybe when I was around ten years old or so she decided to enroll in barber college in Nashville, Tennessee.  She'd have to get up in the morning, catch a bus down to Nashville, spend the day in barber college.  And unfortunately, just before the, the graduation, just before she had accumulated enough hours, the Nashville branch of the barber school closed, and the closest one was in Memphis, Tennessee.  My mom had already ordered the glass frame that had her name embossed on it.  And just a few more hours, she would have able to slip her Tennessee barber's license into that frame.  My sister [Mary Wharton Davis] probably has that now.  Now, she kept cutting hair even after that, to supplement the family income, but she had always wanted to become a licensed barber.
Story_ID: 634051
Speaker 1: There weren't many women barbers, I mean, in barbershops as such.  Did your mother [Mary Seay Wharton] have a--was she, was she gonna be a pioneer, or did she know somebody else that--?
Speaker 2: I don't think she regarded herself as a pioneer.  It's just something she wanted to do.  I don't know whether it came up from cutting my, her, her father's [Frank Seay] hair, my grandfather's hair, and all of her brothers.  She had a bunch of brothers.  But I'll tell you, even without barber college, she was a doggone good barber before she set foot in a barber school.  She knew how to use that razor, strap--they used a straight razor.  I mean, she, she knew that stuff.  Where she learned I, I do not know--hand clippers by the way.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: She would stand all day Saturday.  I don't know how she did it with those hand clippers.  And she eventually managed to get some electric clippers, and let me tell you, it sounded like a jet plane taking off.  And I don't know how she held them.  I could barely pick them up, but she would stand there on her feet hour after hour cutting hair.  I remember the first, her charge was fifteen cent.  And then she went to a quarter, and I'll never forget people complaining about she was charging too much.  But they, they kept coming.
Story_ID: 634052
Speaker 1: Let me go to your father's side, then we'll put them together.  So can you give us your father's--his is the same as yours, right?  Yeah.
Speaker 2: That's right.  Now if you look at his birth documents it'll probably show a period: A period, C period.
Speaker 1: Okay, A.C. Wharton, Sr.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: June 22nd, 1913.
Speaker 1: Okay, so--
Speaker 2: So wait, now wait.  So I made a mistake.  My mother's [Mary Seay Wharton] would be September 6th.  They would--she was three years younger than him, so my mother's birthday was not 1913.  It was 1916.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My dad's was 1913.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right, and where was your father born?
Speaker 2: I think he was born in Smith County, Tennessee, just across the line in the next county, if not somewhere in that vicinity.  But it was in, in or near Wilson County, Tennessee.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And once again, how far back can your fa- can you trace your father's line?
Speaker 2: I, I never knew, never saw my father's father, so certainly I, I could not go beyond that.  I knew his name, but I could not go beyond my, my father.  I never met his grandfather.  You see, my--
Speaker 1: Well, I'm not, I'm, I'm not met him so much--
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: --so much as do you know anything about him, you know.
Speaker 2: Oh no, no--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --no, don't anything about him.  Jim Wharton, James Wharton was his name.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But--
Speaker 1: This is your grandfather, James (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.  He was a farmer just like--
Speaker 1: And your, your, your grandmother on that side?
Speaker 2: Eva Ostell, Ostell, O-S-T-E-L-L-A, Ostella Hearn [sic. Estella Hearn Wharton]--
Speaker 1: H-E-R--
Speaker 2: H-E-A--H-E-A-R-N.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And of course, she married James Wharton.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so, now when did--was your grandfather a farmer?  Was he involved--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Farmer/sharecropper, just like on my maternal side.
Speaker 1: All right, all right, and did, did they, they live in, end up living in Wilson County?
Speaker 2: In and around Wilson County.  Many of the areas, sometimes they were on the Smith County side of the line but mainly in Wilson County, Tennessee.
Story_ID: 634053
Speaker 1: Now what did your father [A.C. Wharton, Sr.] say about growing up?
Speaker 2: What did he s- what are his memories?  What did he say about--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --growing up?
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Well, he, he didn't have much of a childhood because I think he may have been around thirteen or fourteen when his father [James Wharton] died.  And he stepped in to take care of his mother [Estella Hearn Wharton] and his siblings.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So everything he did was work, work, work.  And of course, I grew up feeling the same way.  He, at one time, he really wanted to get out of the South.  He had an aunt who had moved to Kansas City, Missouri.  And so at one time he moved to Kansas City to try to get into heavy industry, but he was a real skinny person.  Heavy construction simply did work out for him.  Matter of fact, he used to love the song "Going to Kansas City, Kansas City here I come" ['Kansas City'].  But he couldn't make it, so he came back to Lebanon [Tennessee], started farming.  And the year that I was born they left the farm.  He'd always wanted to get into the retail or grocery business, so he left the farm the year that I was born, maybe a little before, 'cause I was, I was the first child to be born in a hospital.  So he left the farm in nineteen forty--around 1944.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So from what I read he had a grocery store and a restaurant, sort of.
Speaker 2: Yes.  The, the, the first business was a grocery store/restaurant combination, which was right across the street from the local colored high school and elementary school.
Speaker 1: Now what was the name of those places?
Speaker 2: Market Street Grocery [ph.].  He and a partner, also left the farm at the same time he did, called it the Market Street Grocery.
Speaker 1: I mean now was--I mean the high school and the--
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: Although it was important I'm glad you made that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Sure, sure.
Speaker 1: --yeah.
Speaker 2: The elementary school was Market Street Elementary [Market Street Elementary School, Lebanon, Tennessee].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The high school, and this is interesting, was known as Wilson County Training School [Lebanon, Tennessee].
Speaker 1: I guess--
Speaker 2: White kids went to high school.  Black kids went to training school.
Speaker 1: This is an interesting phenomenon all over the South--
Speaker 2: Yeah, right.
Speaker 1: --industrial schools, training schools.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: And sometimes they say colored schools.
Speaker 2: Oh yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  So in this case it's Wilson County Training School, and that's the high school.  And did it feed the, mostly county, county youth, the African American youth?
Speaker 2: Yes, in that area, but mainly it was the school traffic and the neighbors from right around in that, in that area, a little restaurant, tiny little thing.  There was a laundry dry, a laundry place.  And I remember taking plate lunches and sandwiches down there.  Oh, gee, just I had to be like a five year old, I mean, taking--certainly first grade.  I was delivering sandwiches and lunches.
Speaker 1: Oh, to--
Speaker 2: Down to--there, there was a laund- called Lebanon Laundry [ph.], where folks did industrial--well, they did anything, dry cleaning and dry goods.  So, the workers would have--they would tell my mom [Mary Seay Wharton] at the first of the week what they wanted each day for lunch, and we would take it over there.  Most of the times it was a bowl of beans or something like that and a piece of cornbread.  And then at the end of the day they'd bring the plates and dit- didn't have paper plates and things.  We, folks take that stuff for granted.  But it was actually dishes we'd take down there, and then they would bring them back.
Speaker 1: So you'd have to take them down in a basket or something?  How, how, how would you do it?
Speaker 2: Bag or a box, candy box, anything you could get, just take it in there.  Scared the daylights out of me 'cause all that steam in there every time I (makes sound) and I was afraid I was gonna get scalded in there.  Shouldn't have been in there.  It is a dangerous place.
Story_ID: 634054
Speaker 1: Let me ask, is, is there a story behind how your parents [Mary Seay Wharton and A.C. Wharton, Sr.] met, or how they fell in love?
Speaker 2: No.  I'm sure there is.  All I know is they got married on the town square in Lebanon, Tennessee.  And we have a picture of what my mother wore, the coat and all that she wore at the time of their marriage.
Speaker 1: So do you think they met maybe in the--were they going to the--well, they weren't--they didn't meet in school I guess, right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: Now I, I, I, I've just simply never asked.
Speaker 1: Yeah (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I've heard my, my, hear my mom talk about getting married on the town square, but I never did get to the point of asking where they met.
Speaker 1: Did, did they attend the same church?
Speaker 2: Not originally, no, no.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My mother was Church of Christ, and my dad was, was Methodist initially.
Speaker 1: Okay, so it's not as--yeah, so you say--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --really mysterious then.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: Let me tell you something was really odd about my family.  My family, because of my mother's religion, was almost just puritanical in terms of religious beliefs and all.  And there were ther- certain things that the children, you just didn't talk about.  I remember one of the worst pops upside the head that I ever got was when I saw my Aunt Eva [ph.] pregnant.  And I think I asked how did that ha- I've forgotten how it was.  And boy, did I get slapped, because you weren't supposed to ask.  You didn't probe too much about relationships and things.  So there's a dearth there, quite frankly.  You just didn't, didn't ask those questions.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Yeah, and I think a lot of people can relate to that time period and the--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --attitudes yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I remember long time--one of few times my daddy raised his voice is, we were one of the few families that had a television.  And I'll, I'll never forget it.  It was one Sunday afternoon, evening.  And there was some show on television talking about babies being born.  My daddy came through and heard that.  He said, "Y'all turn that off.  They'll be plenty enough time for you to learn that," 'cause you, you weren't supposed to know anything about that.
Speaker 1: Now this is--you're growing up like in a farming community.  It seems like everybody would know at a certain point how (laughter)--
Speaker 2: No, we weren't supposed to.
Speaker 1: But you weren't supposed to, no?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No, you just, you didn't talk about that.  As a matter fact, to show you, and this was not true only to Lebanon, but there was a time once a teacher became pregnant she had to quit teaching.  You--and the belief was that the children would start asking questions: what did you do?  Matter of fact, there was a teacher, Ms. Hattie Bryant.  She's still living.  She's one of the oldest people in Wilson County [Tennessee].  I got so angry with her.  I really liked her when I was in the fifth grade.  She was a sixth grade teacher, and I was so much looking forward to having her teach me.  But guess what?  She messed around and got pregnant.  And I thought she wasn't gonna be there to teach me.  Fortunately, I think she had the baby over the summer, so she was there to teach me.  But you just didn't bring that kind of stuff around.
Story_ID: 634055
Speaker 1: When you think about your parents' personalities, their dispositions, how they walk, talk, what they look like even, who do you think you take, take after the most?
Speaker 2: My father [A.C. Wharton, Sr.], sense of humor, dry humor; my mother [Mary Seay Wharton], on the hand, very serious, didn't care much for a lot of humor, very serious.  But I would say after my father.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So your, your mother now, she was in the Church of God in Christ, right (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Church of Christ.
Speaker 1: Church of Christ, okay.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: And don't ever confuse the two, if you're to hear her say it (laughter)--
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Oh, so, so this, this church had a very strict code of conduct and yeah--
Speaker 2: It still does, yes.
Speaker 1: Very puritanical you said (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) None of that's changed, right.
Speaker 1: --yeah.  So, okay.  So, and yet she married a Methodist that had a sense of humor.
Speaker 2: But he'd soon have to join the church.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay, so he was a member of that, of her church.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  All right, so what was the name of the local branch of that church?
Speaker 2: Well, my mom's church was the Market Street Church of Christ [Lebanon, Tennessee].  But before that it was Harris Chapel [Harris Chapel Church of Christ], where she was raised up in the Bellwood [Tennessee] community.  But it became the Market Street Church of Christ, and it's still there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My father joined I believe in 1952, and had remained so until his death.
Story_ID: 634056
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, now can you name your siblings for us--
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: --and in order, and tell us a little bit about what they're doing now--
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: --and then tell us where you fit in the lineup.
Speaker 2: Okay.  My oldest sibling is Mary Ewing, that's E-W-I-N-G--named after an uncle--Wharton Davis [Mary Wharton Davis].  She is seventy-four years old.  She was born there in Lebanon, Tennessee, went to Tennessee State University [Tennessee Agricultural and Industrial State University; Tennessee State University, Nashville, Tennessee], majored in home ec [home economics], finished, became a school teacher, taught in Tennessee for many years, got married in 1965, or thereabouts, and moved to Chicago [Illinois], Harvey, Illinois, to, is to be specific, where she taught for many years until she and her husband [James Davis] returned to Memphis in the late '70s [1970s], where she took up a career of teaching in the Memphis City Schools [Shelby County School District].  And she still resides here in Memphis, Tennessee, has two daughters.
Speaker 1: Okay, so she's retired now then.
Speaker 2: Retired school teacher.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Next would be seventy-two year old Ruth Wharton, has been married twice, but she's now divorced, keeps her maiden name, Ruth Wharton.  She is a retired educator, living in Hermitage, Tennessee.
Speaker 1: Hermitage, is that near the ancestral (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, it is.
Speaker 1: --home of--
Speaker 2: It's, it's pretty much--
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: --right in between Lebanon and Nashville [Tennessee].
Speaker 1: Not the ancestral home but the home of Andy Jackson, [President] Andrew Jackson, the president.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --Donelson, Tennessee, Hermitage area.
Speaker 1: Yeah, 'cause he, he was originally from South Carolina, I think.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Hermitage, Tennessee, okay.  All right, who's next?
Speaker 2: Then it would be, I'm next of course.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Then just under me would be Kenneth [Kenneth Wharton], born November 25th, 1946.  He is a physician, OB/GYN [obstetrics and gynecology], retired in Chicago, Illinois single, never been married, no children.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So education was important in the family when you were coming up (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh yes, yes.  And then after Kenneth would be Velma, the last born, Velma Jean Wharton [Velma Wharton Lowe], born in 1952, cannot remember her exact date of birth, but it was 1952, graduated Tennessee State University, taught in the Wilson County [Tennessee] and Davidson County [Tennessee] area for many years, married, relocated to the Chicago, Illinois, area, taught some there, but ended up with a career working in one of the villages there, headed--on the tip of my tongue just a minute ago--in Illinois, just outside Chicago.  She was a village clerk.
Speaker 1: In--
Speaker 2: Oh, it's (unclear) it wasn't--
Speaker 1: Not Harvey but--
Speaker 2: Not Harvey.  My, my--Mary lived (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Markham [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: --in Harvey for a while.
Speaker 1: Markham, Dixmoor [Illinois], Phoenix [Illinois]?  Is that out in the same--
Speaker 2: Prospect--
Speaker 1: --area where, where--
Speaker 2: --Pros--
Speaker 1: --Harvey is?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think it's north.  Harvey is to the south.
Speaker 1: Oh, she's in a northern (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It was Prospect--
Speaker 1: --little west--
Speaker 2: --Prospect Heights [Illinois].
Speaker 1: Prospect Heights.  Yeah, there is a Prospect Heights.
Speaker 2: Village, yeah, Village of Mount Prospect [Illinois].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She was the, at the time of her death, she was the village clerk.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So everybody got a college education.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Everybody did a pro- something professional.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Absolutely, and that's just miraculous.  I mean, it--our parents [Mary Seay Wharton and A.C. Wharton, Sr.] just wouldn't have it any other way.
Story_ID: 634057
Speaker 1: Now your parents were entrepreneurial.  And they, their first business though, from what I've read, like failed basically and didn't, didn't make it, right?
Speaker 2: That's correct.  His, his partner had other ideas.  He had heard about making all the money, making a lot of money in auto plants in the Detroit/Pontiac/Flint, Michigan area, so (makes sound) he up and left.  They stayed out of the business for a while.  But there was a gentleman who had a little grocery store right across the street from where we lived.  My daddy [A.C. Wharton, Sr.] had always wanted to get back in the grocery business.  He bought a little fireworks stand that someone had, just a little screened in thing, oh, about the size of a toilet and pulled it into our yard at home and put a drink machine in there and ice cream machine in there.  My brother [Kenneth Wharton] and I were working it after school.  My mom [Mary Seay Wharton] would work in it early in the morning.  And it became just a family deal.  And eventually we pretty well drained all the business away from Mr. Jim DeBeau [ph.], who had the little store right across the street, so daddy bought it.  And we took over that, expanded it, and then business [A.C. Wharton Market; A.C. Wharton Store, Lebanon, Tennessee] really took off, bought another location, shut that one down, a little wooden framed store, had a cinderblock building.  It's still there today, still a going business today.  We, we had it leased out, got in the gasoline business, restaurant supply business.  And he did that until not too long before his death.
Speaker 1: So was he able to quit the other job and, and work the store?
Speaker 2: He eventually--yes, he require--he, he, he left all of his jobs, the garment plant job, the produce house job, the office cleaning job.  My daddy in any given time would have three or four jobs literally.  I mean, his, his schedule--I don't know--I often wondered when did my daddy's day begin.  And I guess the best way to look at my dad's day would take a Sunday night he'd have to get home early from church [Market Street Church of Christ, Lebanon, Tennessee] because he would go to--his week would start on Sunday night at ten o'clock.  He--
Speaker 1: So he had a job that started at ten o'clock on Sunday (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, he would go to the--at night.  He would go to--his week would begin on Sunday night at ten o'clock when he punched in to the garment factory.  They manufactured blue jeans, overalls and things like that.  He would work there overnight.  You know, we loved to call him a night watchman.  Actually, he was a night janitor, but I would tell folks he was a night watchman 'cause that really sounded (unclear).  He would work there until like six in the morning, walk across the alley, do janitorial work, clean up a little insurance office building, come back home by around 7:30, feed the livestock.  We raised livestock right there.  We were right on the edge of the city limits, so we had hogs, chickens, calves and things like that--make sure they were fed, and then after we bought the store, go over and take inventory in the store to make sure everything was there, eat his breakfast, shave, and by 8:20 go to work at Mr. Tatum's [ph.] produce and restaurant, the supply company, work there 'til four o'clock, come home, feed the livestock again, do the chores around the house, ate dinner, get in the bed by six o'clock, and up at 9:30 to go to work, yes.
Speaker 1: So that's three and half hour of sleep--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --in a period of twenty-four hours.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And I read some, I was reading something about you only sleep fours a night.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You don't--
Speaker 2: It's a little more than that now.  But I, I get up every morning.  I wake up at 4:30.  I'm in the gym at 5:30.  I, 'cause I'll probably regret this when my body collapses, I often say that there's two things that are just grossly overrated.  One is sweet potato pie, and the other is (laughter), the other is sleep (laughter).  So, you miss a lot when you're sleeping.  You need to know what's going on.  And I got that from my daddy.  And he, he just kept going; he just kept going, lived to a ripe old age.
Speaker 1: Okay, 'cause he, he--last reference I saw for him he was eighty-nine.  How long did your father live?
Speaker 2: My dad died in 2003, born--he was ninety, born in 1913.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Lived a good life.
Speaker 1: Yeah, three and a half hours sleep a day (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yep, it was rough.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Yeah, so he sounds like he's really something to be around.
Speaker 2: Yeah, oh, he was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) If he was around, but he was working most of the time.
Speaker 2: That's just it.  But, I mean, he would drag us along with him going to the livestock barn, going to the produce house.  You name it, we were with him.
Story_ID: 634058
Speaker 1: Do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: When I was telling you about Ms. Tennie Seay.  Yeah, maybe she was an aunt, 'cause we called her Aunt Tennie, come to think about it.  But anyway, my earliest memory, and my sister will debate me on this, we had been to see Great-Grandma Tennie or maybe it was Aunt Tennie Seay.
Speaker 1: Could it have been great-aunt?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And it was a bright sunny day.  It had rained.  And there was a little branch that ran in front of Aunt Tennie Seay's yard.  Ordinarily it was about this wide.  And even--and my parents [Mary Seay Wharton and A.C. Wharton, Sr.] and my sisters [Mary Wharton Davis and Ruth Wharton] tell me I was three years old, or about that.  And I saw them, my two sisters, jump over the stream, and I tried to do as they did and jumped right in the middle of it.  Well, here's the, here's, here's the kicker, why I remember this: I had chicken pox or measles at the time.  And the folklore then was if your child had chicken pox, don't let them get wet.  It'll go into pneumonia.  And you see, the folks who came to my rescue didn't think that I was old enough to be cognizant of what they were saying.  But that memory sticks with me today, because I hear them saying, "That's gonna be the death of him.  He's gonna--wrap him up, do this," and I could see, I can right now, I can close my eyes and see the looks on their faces, as if I was going to die just any minute, because that was--whatever the ailment I had--it may have been mumps.  It was something I had, and the common wisdom was if your child has this, don't let him get wet.  And I had jumped, and they all came around.  And I can see them right now with the look on their face, just shaking their head.  "He's not gonna make it."  That's--if you would have asked me one memory, that's it.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: And, and, and it has to be true because my mom remembered it.  And I used to tease them and say my sisters were jealous of me, that they really didn't want me, and I would tease them--I still do this; I (laughter) that they shoved me in that stream to get rid of me because I was a pesty little old brother that they didn't want (laughter).  And so they all--it, it's just amazing to have that back as a three year old and the trauma.  And you know, and I learned--and oftentimes I will hear my wife [Ruby R. Wharton] say about one of our grandkids, "Don't do that.  It could, it could kill him."  I say, "Don't say that."  "Oh, that baby doesn't know what I'm talking about."  I said, "You don't know what that baby understands."  They didn't know that I understood they were saying I was gonna die because I had chicken pox and got wet.  They didn't think I understood that, but I did.  Maybe I didn't understand the words, but I could see the fear in their faces.
Story_ID: 634059
Speaker 1: Can you describe the house you grew up in?
Speaker 2: Yes, four room house, initially.  Living room was distinct in that it had an ac- a real hardwood floor in it.  My parents' bedroom was off to the left as you walked in.  And the children's room would be off to the right, which actually turned into more of a family room because you didn't hang around in the living room.  My father [A.C. Wharton, Sr.], of course, had to get in the bed early, so we would all be in that back room.  My mother [Mary Seay Wharton] would iron.  We'd do homework and stuff.  Was amazing, I don't know how we all got in there--and then, of course, the kitchen and an outdoor toilet.  Later on, I would say probably maybe when I was seventh, eighth grade [at Market Street Elementary School, Lebanon, Tennessee], maybe before, there was an addition to the house, which added another bedroom, bathroom, and enlarged the kitchen, but basically a wood frame house, which is still there in Lebanon [Tennessee].
Story_ID: 634060
Speaker 1: What were--was Lebanon [Tennessee] arranged where there was a black side of town, white side of town, or how was it?
Speaker 2: Basically yes, but you--we knew there was discrimination clearly.  Schools were segregated.  Restaurants, you couldn't go in the front door.  But since there were so few of us--see, once you get out of west Tennessee, the black population starts to drop.  So, we--they didn't, they didn't fear us that much, so they, they did not have to just actively push us down and fight us out.  But oh, yeah, we knew discrimination was there.
Speaker 1: You were mostly in the hills, right?  You're, you're, you're in the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The foothills--
Speaker 1: --foot, foothills--
Speaker 2: --Cumberland Plat--
Speaker 1: --right.
Speaker 2: --the Cumberland Plateau.  That's where you really get into the mountainous section of Tennessee.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So you didn't have the same kind of push you had around Memphis [Tennessee] with black folks coming from Mississippi and Arkansas and--
Speaker 2: That's correct.
Speaker 1: --everywhere.
Speaker 2: Well, and there are a number of reasons, the, the economy there, agriculture, but it was not as labor intensive as cotton.  That's why you had more of a sharecropper arrangement, see, one farmer and one or two sharecropper families.  Many of them had a white sharecropper family on their property and a black sharecropper family.  And there was, of course, a hierarchy there.  Obviously the owner got the best.  The white sharecropper got what was after that, and the black sharecropper got whatever was left after them.  But you didn't need as many laborers to put in the tobacco crop or wheat crop as you did say tobacco.  That's why the, the, the slavery really got a grab, just a real grip on, on this part of the economy.
Speaker 1: Because of cotton.
Speaker 2: The cotton, yes, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Ranching, sheep farming, again, those you didn't need many--as they would say, you didn't need many hands to do sheep farming.
Speaker 1: Just one shepherd, right (laughter)?
Speaker 2: One shepherd, right, and a good dog.
Story_ID: 634061
Speaker 1: I was fascinated by the name of this place called Tater Peeler Road.
Speaker 2: Yeah, um-hm.
Speaker 1: What, what's the story behind Tater Peeler Road?
Speaker 2: Well, if you'll recall, I told you earlier about Mr. Tatum [ph.] who would hire me, thirty-five cent an hour.  I'll never forget.  That's what I made to rake rocks and clean up.  It was a section of Wilson County [Tennessee].  Well, Wilson County as a whole is very rocky.  It's not like it is here.  You can dig a foundation or footing with a teaspoon.  You're up there, everything you do you gotta dynamite and to get through that limestone, that rock.  Legend has it that there was a potato farmer who raised a crop of potatoes out on Tater Peeler Road, loaded them in his wagon to take them to the town square to sell, and that by the time he got to the town square, the potatoes were already peeled because they had joshed around so because the road was so rough.  So legend had it that the ride just peeled the potatoes, so it became Tater Peeler Road.  As a matter of fact, if you--our, our folks don't believe this, but if you go to the big factory--the outlet mall there in Lebanon [Tennessee], once you exit and make that left turn to go back to the interstate highway [Interstate 40], you'll see the sign.  It's right ahead, says Tater Peeler Road, and it's still there.  It's paved now, so it doesn't peel many taters, but it's--
Speaker 1: Okay, so, so does--
Speaker 2: --still there.
Speaker 1: --Mr. Tatum get associated with Tater Peeler (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, no.  That--no, no, no.  That, that's odd.  It was just a coincidence that he bought a farm out there on Tater Peeler, Tater Peeler Road.  But I don't think there was any relationship.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, all right.
Speaker 2: Okay--

Speaker 1: We always ask this question.  This is another kind of growing up question, but what were, considering where you lived and what you were near and what you saw every day, what were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Well, I guess the, the, the, the, the, the sounds, if you would, we lived right on one of the pretty major streets, the hustling and bustling of commerce, people always going somewhere and trucks.  My brother [Kenneth Wharton] and I knew we had to get out of Lebanon [Tennessee].  We perhaps had not articulated it, but there was something in us that always sought mobility, and we were always fascinated by mobility.  We had a silly little game we would play.  We would go up on the highway.  The high--you always went up to the highway.  It wasn't an interstate, but it was Highway 70 [U.S. Route 70].  And those precious moments when we weren't doing chores or whatever, we'd go up on the highway and watch the trucks coming and going.  And he would take one truck, and I would take the--we would alternate.  And I would say, "That's my truck.  It's going to New York [New York]."  "Ah, that truck's not going to New York."  "Yes, it is, and it's got new shoes in it."  And of course he would take next truck coming along.  We didn't know our direction.  Truck would be going east, we'd say, "It's going to California."  "That truck can't go all the way to California."  "And it's got some new furniture in it."  We, and we would just play that game, and our minds would just go everywhere, just thinking but we'll get out of here, we'll get out of here.  One of these days maybe we can drive a truck, and that's how we'll get out of here.  And my daddy [A.C. Wharton, Sr.] always wanted to be in business, so on the morning when he was gonna take livestock to town, I could hear the truck come in, if we had enough to hire somebody to haul it or to use his truck, the sounds of commerce.  The smell would be my mother [Mary Seay Wharton] cooking.  As always, she was the best cook anywhere around.

Speaker 1: How old were you, were, were you when your father [A.C. Wharton, Sr.] started the, the store [A.C. Wharton Market; A.C. Wharton Store, Lebanon, Tennessee] w- in the old fireworks stand?
Speaker 2: I would have to say that I was in the, oh, maybe in the eighth grade.
Speaker 1: So you were about thirteen then.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Let me go a little back before that time.  And you started school.  Now what was the name of your school?  Did I ask you that before?
Speaker 2: Market Street Elementary.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Market Street Elementary School [Lebanon, Tennessee].
Speaker 2: Right, was the first--
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: --through eighth grade.
Speaker 1: All right, okay.  So was this--how many--I mean what--how, how, how big a school was it and--
Speaker 2: It was typical.  It was not the one room type school deal.  But there was a, a room for each grade and kind of an auditorium.  It did not have a gym.  And we had an, an assembly room.  There was no library as such.  There was a place that was supposed to have been a library, but it turned into more of a storage room.  There was a small kitchen and cafeteria, home cooked, full plate meals that we would have there once they started the hot lunch program in the school--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --playground, and that was it.
Speaker 1: Have, what, what did you have on the playground?  Did you have some swings or something?
Speaker 2: Wasn't much.  There was a merry-go-round, a set of swings, and seesaws.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And later on they built kind of a tennis court that also doubled as a basketball court.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now, now did, did you like school?
Speaker 2: Oh yes, after first grade.
Speaker 1: So was first grade was rough?
Speaker 2: Oh, very traumatic.  I, I, I loved work.  See, I started working with my dad I guess four or five years old, literally, and I'll pause and repeat that, four or five years old, doing everything.  If he had a fencing project he was doing, he'd let me--I don't think I may have been helping him that much, but he would pretend.  If he had a fence post, he'd tell me to get that end there, and I would help my daddy carry that fence post.  He'd put it in the post hole, and I would shove the dirt in, kick it around with my feet.  So I may--and I just loved that, feeding the sheep, feeding the cows, pigs, whatever.  Work was just my thing.  Matter of fact, I have a, it's--I keep it in my office.  I wanted to be so much like my daddy, and my daddy wore coveralls and a shirt and a bowtie in many instances.  Men who worked in we call them service stations then, where you bought your gasoline--be- because you didn't simply buy a gallon of gasoline; you bought the service, and they washed your windows.  And keep in mind--this is gonna seem weird--the men who worked in service stations actually wore bowties and all and coveralls and all.  And I wanted to dress like that, and I did dress like that.  I still have the picture, 'cause I wanted to work.  And I never will forget--it was about the first day of school--my youngest aunt--'cause I told you my father's dad [James Wharton] died early, so he was basically raising my youngest aunt on his side of the family, and she had moved in with us.  So she was in the high school [Wilson County Training School, Lebanon, Tennessee].  High school was just next door to Market Street.  And I will never forget she came over to the first grade, and I was just sitting there watching the kids doing the silly stuff called playing.  And I just said god what a waste of time.  Look at them.  They're just out there running around.  They're not producing anything.  I hate this stuff.  I, I just had--and it took a while for me to say well, you know, they're not gonna let me quit in the first grade.  So once I got through the first grade it was fairly, fairly easy.  I didn't--I could read really good, so the teacher put me in with the redbird.  You're not old enough to remember that.  They, they would--you were tracked in school.  Redbirds would be the best, bluebirds, and I wanted to be back there with the buzzards.  I didn't like all that stuff.  But since--
Speaker 1: The buzzards actually were the lowest--
Speaker 2: Oh no, I, I--that's where I wanted to be.  She didn't have a buzzard group (laughter).  I just, I say that 'cause I just had so much disdain, because I--when the redbird group would come up to read, I was the only boy.  And the other boys would sit back there (gestures), (laughter) make faces at me 'cause I'm up there with the girls.  I didn't like that.  I wanted to dumb down.
Story_ID: 634064
Speaker 1: Did your parents teach you to read at home?  I mean, did, did your mother [Mary Seay Wharton] or, or, or father [A.C. Wharton, Sr.] or--
Speaker 2: Oh, my mom will tell--yeah, I wish she were here to tell.  But once I got into it, I, I got frustrated.  I would hear my mother read magazines and newspapers and things at night, and she would read them aloud quite often.  And I didn't know how a newspaper worked, but I remember she had read me a story out of the paper one day about something.  And I don't know why I thought the newspaper would be the same every day.  But shortly after, once I got the swing of the first grade [Market Street Elementary School, Lebanon, Tennessee] I grabbed the newspaper and started looking for the same story she had read me.  But I didn't know it didn't show up every day like a book that was there (laughter).  Yes, she did read to us.  Then we had Sunday school, where the Sunday school teacher [at Market Street Church of Christ, Lebanon, Tennessee] would teach us to read from a little card, Bible verses and things like that even before, even before school.  They would just give you the word, and you'd repeat it, whatever.   And there as a, there was a real respect for the printed page in my family.  Let me tell you one thing, my [maternal] grandmother [Dessie Manning Seay] and others would go off to do housework, domestic work.  And it's kind of funny.  It's sick, but in a way it's kind of funny how they would maybe pay them a dollar but then give them a bunch of junk to make them feel good, old magazines, stuff that was so old, dog-eared, just anything to make, make--give them--feel I'm giving them something.  But we had a rule in my house, no matter how old Life magazine was or Reader's Digest, if it came in the front door, it did not go out the back door until you read it.  I remember trying to read the Reader's Digest, every once in a while an old National Geographic, a Sears [Sears, Roebuck and Co.] catalog.  If you came in it, in that front door, you tried to read it.  And my mom knew this, and this is why she bought our set of encyclopedia, Funk and Wagnalls [Funk and Wagnalls Standard Encyclopedia], which we still have, still on the bookshelf to this day, one book at a time.  Can you imagine that?  It took maybe two years, maybe three years, 'cause you'd get one volume.  You'd mail in fifty cent, and you'd get another one.  And it took forever for us to get that one set of Funk and Wagnalls encyclopedia that, as I say, the books are still there.  My mother really sacrificed to make sure that this was one family that had some books in the house, made all the difference in the world.
Story_ID: 634065
Speaker 1: Did you receive any periodicals at home, like the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Not really--
Speaker 1: --Tri-State Defender or (unclear)?
Speaker 2: No, we did not.  Now, I became the first distributor, a salesman, for the Baltimore Afro-American [Afro-American Newspapers] newspaper.  A gentleman came through one day.  We saw him pull up in a big Pontiac, handsome black man, my wa- mother [Mary Seay Wharton] and I sat there watching him across the street at the store talking to Mr. Jim DeBeau [ph.], the man from whom we bought our store.
Speaker 1: Was Jim DeBeau a white man or--
Speaker 2: No.  He was a black man.
Speaker 1: He was a black man, okay.
Speaker 2: Don't know much about him, but his name was Jim DeBeau.  He sat over there talking to for a long--then he came across the street and talked to my mom and said, "We're bringing this paper, want this paper to, to, to be sold here, and we're looking for someone. And Mr. Jim De- DeBeau said that your son here might sell this paper for us."  So for a number of years I, I sold the Afro--Baltimore Afro-American in Lebanon, Tennessee there.  I'd get twenty-five of them every week.  If I sold them I'd go downtown and buy a money order and send it to them.  The ones I did not sell I had to clip out the date on them.  What that meant I do not know.  I'd, I'd send that back as proof that I didn't sell them, so.  And I'd get--I think it cost fifteen cent or a quarter, and I'd get a nickel out of each one I sold.  So, and, and we would hear every once in a while someone who had been away from Lebanon would see me with that paper, and they would say, "Is that the Pittsburgh Courier [New Pittsburgh Courier]?  Is that the Tri-State Defender?"  I'd never heard of those papers.  But I was selling the Baltimore Afro-American.  Matter of fact, that's where I read about Brown v. Board of Education [Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954], 'cause the local papers didn't give it that much coverage.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So would they ship them in to the post office or, or to the--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The mailman would bring them.
Speaker 1: Just bring them to you?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He'd leave them, put them up at the mailbox out there.  I'd come home--they'd get there like on a Thursday, Friday at the latest.  And I would get out and sell them on Saturdays.
Speaker 1: Could you sell them around town on, on, on, on foot, or did you have a bike?
Speaker 2: On foot at first, and I got my bicycle with a basket on it, and I'll go all over the city.
Speaker 1: About how old were you when you started selling them?
Speaker 2: I had to be about nine or ten, yeah.  (Laughter) It was really an odd thing happened.  On the road where I lived there was a, was, was a road to a fishing resort called Center Hill Dam.  And folks would come through from Nashville [Tennessee].  And I'll never, I never will forget one day I was walking down the street with my Baltimore Afro-American newspapers.  A bunch of white guys pulled up.  "Hey, boy, give me a paper."  So I rolled the paper up and handed it to him.  He gave me a quarter or whatever, didn't wait, took off up the road.  I looked.  About a quarter of a mile I saw the window come down in that car and (makes sound) newspaper, 'cause it had all that stuff in there.  I just, I hate--I could just hear him cursing.  And he'd thought he bought The Nashville Tennessean [The Tennessean].  He thought I was like a newsboy, had papers under my arm.  "Hey, boy, give me a paper."  "Sure, here it is."  I didn't tell him this is a colored paper.  (Laughter) So, I can still see it flying through the air.
Story_ID: 634066
Speaker 1: So now in school, now did you have a favorite teacher at, at Market Street Elementary [Market Street Elementary School, Lebanon, Tennessee]?
Speaker 2: You know, that's hard to say.  They, anybody who opened doors for me of learning I was just crazy about them.  It would be hard for me to choo- I, I can, if we had the time I could go through every one of those teachers.  And I have a speech that I make quite often in which I emphasize that what a teacher imparts to the student is much more than what he or she pulls right out of the printed page.  And I can take each teacher, and I, and for example, I was telling you earlier about how I was ashamed to be up there with the redbird group 'cause that was for girls.  But Ms. Ballard [Alberta Sanders Ballard], without chastising me, let me know that there was nothing wrong with a boy being able to read just as good as a, a, a girl, or as well as a girl.  Ms. Marie Burton [ph.], my second grade teacher, ordinarily, when the teacher have to go to the office to see the principal, because they didn't have telephones and intercoms or emails, what would happen is a messenger would come to the classroom and say, "Mr. Ballard [William A. Ballard] needs to see you in the office."  And the teacher would pick someone to take names of those who acted up.  And one time she chose me, and that taught me a responsibility.  Ms. Watson, my--it's really funny.  Her name was Ms. Ludaniel Latson, but she married a Reverend Watson [ph.].  So we, we just loved saying her name, Ms. Ludaniel Latson Watson [ph.], Ludaniel Latson Watson, just funny little thing we did.  She taught me about real just trustworthiness, because she would allow me, 'cause I'd been doing this when I was at the grocery story, to go all the way downtown to buy penny stamps for her.  She would take the money, wrap it in the corner, tie it in the corner of a napkin, a, a kerchief rather, and I would go all the way downtown.  So, those things--each one of my teachers did something special for me above and beyond all right, learn to read this book, learn to color this, learn that.  There was a trait that I picked up from each of them separate and apart from what they did from the printed page.
Story_ID: 634067
Speaker 1: So did Market Street Elementary [Market Street Elementary School, Lebanon, Tennessee] go all, go up to eighth grade?
Speaker 2: Eighth grade.
Speaker 1: And then you went to the--
Speaker 2: Wilson County Training School [Lebanon, Tennessee].
Speaker 1: --Wilson County Training School, okay.  What about Wilson County Training School, how--what, what--but the time you got to high school, now this would have been, what, do you know what it was?
Speaker 2: Fifty-eight [1958].
Speaker 1: Fifty-eight [1958], okay.  Wilson County Training School--oh, I skipped over--you, you made reference to Brown v. the Board [Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954].  We need to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: --at least go back and talk about that.  Did you understand what that was when you read about it?
Speaker 2: Had a little trouble understanding it, because the thought of going to a white school was just, that was so distant.  I mean, that--we just--you just hadn't thought of that.  My parents [Mary Seay Wharton and A.C. Wharton, Sr.] would talk about education, but I never did hear them say you're gonna be good as white people.  And it was just you got to be good.  You got--but they never did just say you gotta do this so white folks will like you.  So the race conscious thing just wasn't that prevalent.  So when I, I started reading about it, and, and people, grown folks didn't want to talk about it too much now 'cause they didn't want that kind of trouble starting around here.  I remember Ms. Naomi DeBeau [ph.], around the time that Brown v. Board of Education came out.  She would come down to my mother's house quite often, and they would talk early in the morning.  It was really funny.  She was a smoker.  She and Ms. Juanita [ph.] smoked, and women aren't supposed to smoke.  And my mother didn't smoke, but they would come down to my mother's house to smoke a cigarette, and I never understood that 'cause my mother didn't smoke.  And I would hear them.  And right around the time Brown v. Board of Education, I remember hearing Ms. Naomi DeBeau say on time, "Lord, Mary, if this stuff keeps going, it's gonna be a race riot like they had in Chicago [Illinois] one time."  This lady had lived in Chicago.  Now whether there was ever a race riot, I didn't know.
Speaker 1: That was 1919.  It was a long time ago.
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --but she, she would say that.  And so, you, you just didn't talk about that thing too much.  Matter of fact, I don't recall having any discussions with my parents about it, because keep in mind, it's not as if the [U.S.] Supreme Court ruled and the next year we became the rainbow, and--'cause it was forever before it, it really took effect.  But it wasn't talked about that much.
Story_ID: 634068
Speaker 1: One thing that made the news, regarding race relations--I'm sure it must have been in the Afro-American [Baltimore Afro-American; Afro-American Newspapers], 'cause you were about, about ten; that's about the time you started carrying the Afro-American I guess--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --was the, the murder of Emmett Till--
Speaker 2: Yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) the lynching of Emmett Till.  Did you see that in the paper?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And every once in a while, there was a black barbershop that I would drop by, and they would have--where I, where I think I first saw the picture, it may have been in the Jet magazine--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --or the Afro-American.  I remember seeing it in the Afro-American because it was the first time I'd ever seen--you never heard of a, anybody taking a picture of somebody in a casket.  But obviously that was intentional.  And I remember, remember seeing that.
Speaker 1: A lot of discussion accompanied that as well about--
Speaker 2: Quite a bit of discussion covered that.  It was, there was an irony.  My father [A.C. Wharton, Sr.] had a brother named Uncle Jimmy [ph.] who just disappeared.  He--we--I think he went to Chicago [Illinois] or maybe Missouri or somewhere and just left the face of the earth.  And word had it was that he had dated a white woman or something.  But we never, never--but there was a lot of talk about that around the Emmett Till thing.  I always heard them say, "That's probably what happened to Uncle Jimmy."  I remember we, we had a picture.  I, I think he was a taxi driver in Chicago, never saw him.  The only memory I have is a picture, so it kind of riveted my family because I would hear the grown folks talking, not telling us.  'Cau- we weren't supposed to hear stuff like that.  But in a small house you hear everything, and it sticks with you.
Story_ID: 634069
Speaker 1: Now those are the days when the telephones had party lines and that sort of thing (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.  We had, we were the first, well, the actual first black family to get a telephone was Mr. Starling Bass [ph.] and Ms. Alice Bass [ph.] a couple doors up on the opposite side of the street.  I have so, so many memories of that because I had an aunt who lived in Seattle.  And whenever she was going to call to check on my [maternal] grandmother [Dessie Manning Seay], she would write a letter like two weeks ahead of time, and, "I will call y'all on X day."  And we would all rush up to Ms. Alice Bass' house.  And long distance was very faulty at that time.  Sometimes a call would come through; sometimes it wouldn't come through.  So we'd sit and wait, hoping to hear, and then we would have to go back home.  Then you would get another letter saying I'll call, and they would rush back up to get that long distance call.
Speaker 1: These are the days before speaker phones too, so--
Speaker 2: Oh yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) you just, you had a black receiver--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --right, and you had--
Speaker 2: That's all you had.  You'd, you'd--they'd wait for the phone to ring.  You pick it up, and the operator, or central they called them, would say, "Long distance call from Frankie Seay, Seattle, Washington."  And plus, big time you make it person to person so you wouldn't have to pay.  So that's why my mother [Mary Seay Wharton] had to be there.  So she'd take that call, and I'd just see the joy on her face, and then the dejection when the call did not come through.
