Speaker 1: Okay. My name is Monique D. Davis. That's M-o-n-i-q-u-e, D for Dionne, and my married name is Davis, D-a-v-i-s. I represent the 27th District in the State of Illinois and we're South Side of Chicago [Illinois]. I was elected in 1986.
Story_ID: 57415
Speaker 1: And so that was the time-- I start out usually by asking -- I usually start out by asking five questions that have nothing to do with anything, except they're on our questionnaire also. I'd like to know what your favorite food is. I just want short responses.
Speaker 2: Fried chicken, fried catfish, a little bit of grits and cornbread. (Laughter)
Speaker 1: Okay. Your favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Oh, Africa, at this point. South Africa; Ghana, West Africa. That is my home.
Speaker 1: Your favorite color?
Speaker 2: Black. I asked someone, "What do you think my favorite color is?" Black. My car is black. Usually I love black suits. I think I like black. I like red, but black is favorite. (Laughter)
Speaker 1: Your favorite time of year?
Speaker 2: Summer and spring. I think in the summertime you can just enjoy so many sites, do so many things in Chicago [Illinois] you can't do in the winter. And in the spring, I just like to see the new growth, the flowers blooming and the trees budding. I always think it's a newness, it's a renewal, and I love spring.
Speaker 1: And favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: "May God bless you." And I truly mean it, and your mom had the same saying. She said that to me and I knew she meant it, too.
Story_ID: 57416
Speaker 1: We're going to get started, and I usually start out by just trying to understand someone's background and their parents'. And so I'd like you to talk about - you were born here in Chicago [Illinois], right?
Speaker 2: Yes. Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: 1936?
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: And so I'd like you to talk about your parents, your mother and father, what you know about them.
Speaker 2: My father, James McKay. He was a scarfer at United States Steel Mill and he was there fifty years and he got a plaque at the end of those fifty years. My dad used to read to us. I remember sitting on his lap and he would read the newspaper to us. My dad had a third grade education. My mom worked for quite a while in the stores. You know, she was not a clerk, but traffic clerk in some of the major department stores. And eventually, with five girls at home, she went back to school to become a beautician, and she had a shop for a while. And then after that, she did hair, as they called it then, did hair on the porch. My mother was a great reader and that's where my name came from. She was reading a book in reference to France and the story was about a girl named Monique. And she said during her pregnancy she just decided to call me Monique. And the interesting thing is, I don't remember the name of the story, but she said the girl was involved politically, which was very unheard of in France. And I thought that was an interesting event.
Story_ID: 57417
Speaker 1: My parents [James McKay and Constance McKay] were extremely wonderful, in my opinion. We lived in a little frame house that each time a baby was born, my dad, himself and his friends, added another room to it. They both were very, very -- they were sure their children would become educated because that was their greatest desire. That you be a Christian and that you be educated. And I remember my dad reading the newspaper to us and he would, at that time, there was a lot of talk, I guess, of what was going on in Russia and what was going on in Germany in reference to the Jewish people [the Holocaust]. And I remember sitting on his lap and he's reading and the tears were coming down his eyes and he said, "Can you believe what they've done to those people?" And I just, as a little girl, I kind of remembered those events. Both my parents felt that all of their girls should, first of all, get an education, and it's amazing that we did. I have a number of sisters. The oldest one, Lucille, she was a counselor at a Chicago public school. She's retired. My next sister was a supervisor for Western Electric, who went out of business some years ago. My brother was a Chicago postal worker. The next sister worked for the Cook County Board. She was a supervisor and one of the first to learn the computers. The next sister, Sylvia, is a counselor at a Chicago public school, and I, of course, was a teacher. I had counseling education, I just never did. And then the next sister was a teacher. She's retired. And, of course, my baby sister is a teacher. Isn't that amazing? (Laughter) We used to play school in the kitchen and we had a chalkboard. Living next door to us there was a teacher who used to throw books out, and they would be so moldy and they would smell, and we would bring them in the house and put them on the back porch, and my mother would yell, "Get those books out of here. They've been wet. That's why they smell. They've been wet." But we would keep them there and we would sometimes loan them out to other kids on the block for a penny a week or something. But our entire environment on the block that I lived in was filled with love and nourishing. We took piano lessons and none of us, I think, only one, my baby sister plays the piano today. But taking piano lessons meant we had recitals. And I'll never forget my mother and the neighbors rushing to get our dresses for the recital finished. They would be pink organdy, lime organdy, bright yellow organdy with the big bows, you know, and it's got to be done by three o'clock Sunday. And I remember the other ladies on the block coming down to help my mother finish her girls' dresses for the recital and, of course, they'd all be there to hear us try to play. (Laughter) On our block, at one corner, there was Mr. and Mrs. Ross. They had three children. The next house was Mr. and Mrs. Shelby. They had two children. The next block -- the next house was Mr. and Mrs. Kelly. They had seven children. Then Mr. and Mrs. Rogers didn't have any children, but the next one was the Chandler's. They had nine children. The next one were the Fuller's. They had five, and then it was our house and there was what? Nine of us. And you move on down the block. It was families with husbands, wives and children. Our father was one of the first men on the block to own a car, which meant when he took my mom shopping for groceries, he'd take two other families grocery shopping. And then he'd come back, unload them and take somebody else grocery shopping. Those were the days when they had running boards on the cars. (Laughter) You know, you could kind of sit on - - stand on the running board if you didn't have too far to go. But it was truly a wonderful experience. Directly across the street, 95th and Harvard, it was a vacant lot and when it rained, it would fill with water. And part of our play time was pretending to fish and we'd make a fishing pole and, you know, pretend that we were catching fish, and we really were catching leaves. (Laughter) Today, St. Thaddeus [Catholic] Church sits on that particular lot.
Story_ID: 57418
Speaker 1: My mother [Constance McKay] was from Monroe, Louisiana and then as a young child they moved to Houston, Texas and that's where she was raised. She was born in Louisiana. My dad [James McKay] was born in Savannah, Georgia but as a young child they moved to Macon, Georgia and he never went back. When he got to Chicago [Illinois], I think he said he was twelve years old and he walked almost all the way. And he never had an education but he learned to do so many things and he valued education and I believe that part of my dad and mom's entire role in life was preparing us to be major contributors to society. And they did live to see all of us just about become teachers and they were very, very proud of that.
Story_ID: 57419
Speaker 1: I'd like you to talk about your - did your parents [Constance McKay and James McKay] share any stories about their growing up, or things that they told you about your grandparents or -
Speaker 2: Well I met - well of course we knew both my mother's mother and my mother's father, my grandmother and grandfather, and I also knew my dad's mom and his dad. My mother's mother, her name was Virginia. We called her Mother V and she lived in Houston, Texas and we called her husband, my grandfather, Papa Dutton. Papa Dutton had like a little Creole accent and I was short. I'm short like Papa Dutton and my dad. Mother V was a very tall statuous woman. She was very I won't say strict but she was a very serious woman. And they did talk about the fact that Mother V's mother had been a slave and that they were very concerned that my mother and father didn't want us to hear that kind of talk as they called it, but I wanted to hear about it. My grandfather from Houston, Texas used to make many things. He would make ashtrays, flower holders, I guess ceramics, or he would make things with wood. Mother V from Texas she made the best candy and she would send us candy or she would make dresses for us and they would come in a big box and we were always so happy to get those packages. My father's mother and father, Grandma Van as she was called Grandma Van was a tall very thin woman who was very fair and could pass for white. She had very long almost blond hair. I mean extremely long hair. And then my grandfather was the color I love, black, and he had an African name. So when they married, after marriage, he took her name McKay, which I thought was so interesting, and her name was Irish, I guess, but my grandfather took his wife's name, which I thought was so peculiar. And Mother V had, I thought, beautiful features. You know, she had the high cheekbones and the very large lips, and rather large nose. I thought she was just so beautiful and stately. You know, she carried herself - in a way, [Nelson] Mandela reminds me of her, which is weird. Reminds me of my grandmother because of the way that they carried themselves. And just their presence in a room commands respect, and that's what Mother V was like also. I think my grandfather on my dad's side, we called him Papa, he was very quiet. I'm not going to say he was bitter, but he was a very quiet man and he depended on my dad a great deal it seems to kind of round the family up together. When holidays came, usually it was our house that all the brothers and their children came to celebrate. Be it Memorial Day or Christmas, or New Year's Eve dinner, my mom and dad, it seems, were the focal point of the family, and most all of them came to our house for dinner, and my mom, of course, did the major cooking. Even though my dad was not the oldest brother, he was the one that was depended on. He'd sent for his father and mother and his brothers and sisters from Georgia. He was the one who sent for them, and they stayed at our house until they were situated or on their own feet.
Story_ID: 57420
Speaker 1: Now, just real quickly. The one [paternal] grandfather who took McKay as his name, do you know what his African name was?
Speaker 2: I'm sorry, I don't. We have not been able to find that out.
Speaker 1: Okay. So you got a lot of-
Speaker 2: Well, say it.
Speaker 1: Right, the perceptions of things-- of people. You know, a lot of times people think of our families as not being together and, yet, you tell a different story.
Speaker 2: Oh, absolutely. Not only our family, our entire community. They were - we were so terribly together. It gives you such a sense of security. It makes you know how valuable and how important that you are, or that you were and that you still are. All of those families who lived in that block [95th and Harvard, Chicago, Illinois] would make sure on certain nights that they were - I don't know what you would call it - say my mother [Constance McKay] may be canning, and tonight all of the women would come to her house to help her complete her canning. The next week, say Thursday night, someone may be making a quilt and all of the women would sit there and they would sew on Ms. Roth's or one of the neighbor's quilts. And if one of the children had misbehaved, I remember this as plain as my hand, if you misbehaved, any of those parents would literally spank you. And I'll never forget going into the street to get a ball and Mrs. Morgan, who lived a little ways down, she snatched me up and spanked my bottom, and I ran in the house crying, and she - I got it again from my parents because you don't go in the street for anything. And this was protection. They were protecting me. And I remember one corner house. She had a big yard and they grew corn, and they always made sure that every family shared in the corn they got from their yard. Now, all families had gardens also. We had gardens across the street. Remember, I told you it was a vacant lot. My father [James McKay] and the other men would plow that field. All the families could take any plot they wanted to. We'd have cucumbers, we'd have tomatoes, string beans, people might not know but rhubarb. We'd have greens, collards and mustards and turnips, and it was simply wonderful. And even though these gardens were not fenced in, nobody took what was not theirs. People shared. If you needed tomatoes for your salad today, "Oh, here. Sure. Take some." It was simply marvelous. I am very grateful for that upbringing. We had chickens at one time and I'll never forget one winter. They called the babies "pulleys," and all of these little chickens were sick or dying, and my parents were up nursing them, and then the neighbors were coming. And you would have thought a person, but the point was these chickens were being raised to feed people. We were going to eat those chickens, and so the community was as concerned as my immediate family was.
Story_ID: 57421
Speaker 1: I learned a great deal from my parents [James McKay and Constance McKay]. I learned to value education. I learned to realize that God is truly the center of your life and all that you do. I still attend church and I proudly go to Trinity United Church of Christ [Chicago, Illinois]. At that time, we went to Lilydale First Baptist [Chicago, Illinois]. Lilydale First Baptist was like, oh, I guess maybe they call it a one room church. (Laughter) And the families who participated in that church were all from that little community, and they'd have programs, like the Easter program. It would be unheard of that you were not in the Easter program or the Christmas program. And the entire community would be there when you were practicing. It was simply marvelous. It was marvelous. And I attempted to emulate that in my classroom when I taught at [Walter Q.] Gresham Elementary School. In fact, in that school, we had some wonderful times based upon what I had been taught to believe in and the life that I have chosen to live.
Story_ID: 57422
Speaker 1: Now tell me Mrs. Davis. What was the young Monique Davis like?
Speaker 2: Oh, boy! (Laughter) Do you really want to know? My sisters would say very bossy. (Laughter)
Speaker 1: You're not the oldest though.
Speaker 2: No, I was not.
Speaker 1: Are you the -
Speaker 2: Well, my father [James McKay] had been married before. His wife died. From that wife he had Lucille, Ruth, Ethelyn and my brother, James, Jr. His wife died and when the baby was two, he married my mom [Constance McKay], and the two of them had all five of us girls. So in the house, as we grew up, I was in the middle. Virginia and Sylvia were older. Jocelyn and Connie were the babies. So I was kind of in the middle. Many times I was told, "You can't do this because you're not as old as they are", and then other times, "You're too big to do this because you're not a baby." So I thought, "Well, where do I fit in here?" So I had to make a place for myself, and I became the leader. (Laughter) We often had, shall I say, discussions in reference to political issues. Some of my sisters would disagree with me vehemently when I would- they said I'd make excuses for people, but I didn't think I was making excuses for people. I would try to find a reason that a person behaved in a particular way. I think my sisters encouraged me and I encouraged them. You know, when I look at the Williams girls today [Venus Williams and Serena Williams], who just played in a tournament and one sister, the older sister [Venus Williams] won, I know exactly how they felt because sometimes in our church we may have poetry contests where you're going to do a reading and someone else is going to do a reading, and you wanted to do your best, but still you love that sibling so much that you didn't want that person to be hurt. Today, I find that my sisters are extremely supportive of me. We thank each other for the inspiration. For example, my youngest sister, Connie, completed college before I did. I was seventeen years old. I had been to college for one semester and I got married. My parents cried. The tears rolled down my dad's eyes. My husband [Robert Davis] was drafted in the service and was going to Korea [Korean War]. So the decision was, are we going to wait till he comes back? Well, my thought was, he might not come back. And being young, you know, I guess we just thought we knew what was best. I had graduated from Calumet High School at the age of sixteen before at Gillespie Elementary School at the age of twelve. When I think of that, it was a bit young.
Story_ID: 57423
Speaker 1: At twelve, I graduated from Gillespie [Elementary School], at sixteen, from Calumet [High School]. Went to Chicago State [University] for one semester. And to be honest with you, I didn't like the racism that I encountered. I had dealt with it. Now, this is really important. Calumet High School, when I attended it, I'd be many times the only African-American in that class. I had one teacher who would skip me. If you had presentations to make, she would skip me as if I didn't exist. And as a child, I thought, "I don't have to prepare for her because she's not going to call on me." And today, I realize what an awful, what an awful thing the woman did. However, in my mind, I was always preparing, but I knew she was not going to call on me. But I would - I'd say, "Just in case she calls on me, this is what I'll say or do." She never called on me, but she really made me realize that you can make a speech or give an answer without having it written down. So I thank her for that. But can you imagine treating a child that way? We were not treated very well at Calumet High School. There was a - it was filled with racism. The adults were very unfair to the students. So I was really kind of glad to be done with that. When I went to Chicago State and encountered a similar experience, I really didn't want any part of education after that. I thought I'll get married and just do something else.
Story_ID: 57424
Speaker 1: But my husband, Robert Davis, and I moved to Colorado. And then very early after that, I had my first child. At nineteen, I was married with two kids. (Laughter) I worked many little jobs in order to assist my husband. I'll never forget. I was working at Johnson & Johnson and I was rolling cotton. Can you imagine? You're not picking it, rolling it. Rolling cotton on this machine and I was so proud of this big check I had earned because I worked nights. And my mother [Constance McKay] looked at me and you would have thought I had done something illegal because she found no pleasure in that check when her child that she felt was so bright wasted her time with such employment. And I felt when I - I felt, "Well my mother's not approving of me. I'm used to her approval." So after that, I went back to college [Chicago State University] at the age of twenty-seven. For young women, you can do it. I went back to college at the age of twenty-seven. Loved it so much. I had learned how to deal with racism. Let it be someone else's problem and not your own. And what's so important, I think, is when you want to learn something, this is what my mom said to me, "You be sure it's in your head. That they cannot take away from you. If the grade isn't what you think it should be, don't let that stop you. Get the knowledge," and that's what I started to do. (Background talking.) Oh, I was going to say, "Just get the knowledge", and that's what I started to do. And then when I look back, I have worked - I have about six hours towards a doctorate degree. (Laughter) I find that being involved with education and educators, educators that it helps to relieve and it helps you learn to deal with a lot of the stresses in society, and that's a weapon. (Laughter)
Story_ID: 57425
Speaker 1: How long were you in Denver [Colorado]?
Speaker 2: We stayed in Denver, I would say, about eight months.
Speaker 1: So you weren't there that long.
Speaker 2: No, not that long. We lived in Colorado Springs, Colorado Springs, Colorado.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now you came back - You started school at twenty-seven.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: Okay. How old were your kids at that time?
Speaker 2: Oh, I don't remember. My little girl - I used to comb my daughter's hair. She was about in third or fourth grade. I'd comb her hair while she was reading to me. Every moment was precious. So I'd say, "Honey, read this page while I'm combing your hair." I don't remember how old they were. They were in about fourth, fifth grade. They were young. Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: Okay. What - how was that experience going back to school at that point?
Speaker 2: Very hard because I was working part-time at Del Farm Foods. I had classes at Chicago State [University]. I had classes at a junior college because I was trying to get everything in place, and I had a husband [Robert Davis] and I had a home. We had purchased a home at 93rd and Green [Chicago, Illinois]. So it was very difficult. We were very poor. But eventually, my husband [Robert Davis] said to me, "I think it's time for you to stop working if you're really going to finish school. You need to, you know, quit working." And I did and, of course, that did help me to get through much quicker. It was - the experience, when I look back, it was not an impossible dream, but I do wonder how I did it. (Laughter) I look back and I wonder, "How did you accomplish that?"
Story_ID: 57426
Speaker 1: And after that [graduating from Chicago State University], shortly after that period, my loving, blooming, young romance ended and we were divorced [from Robert Davis]. That's when times really got hard because, as a teacher, a young teacher, I wasn't earning that much. And I'll never forget, I needed a couch in my living room because it was sitting on bricks, and I also needed encyclopedias for my children, who were getting older and needed to study different resource materials. So I had to make a decision and I said, "I'm going to buy those encyclopedias. We'll just keep this couch on bricks." So we bought the encyclopedias. And then my neighbor down the street. Lois (Deen?), she said, "Monique, we're getting a new couch. Would you like ours?" I said, "Lois, I would love it." She said, "Well, how are you going to get it?" Lots and I laugh today because she and I carried that couch. She lived about 9335 and we carried it down the block to my house and took the old one out. So I always tell her, "I know what it means to use people's things they've used." And I do appreciate that, but I valued education for my children so much that I was willing to sacrifice and have encyclopedias rather than a new couch, and it paid off because they both have their degrees. My daughter's an assistant principal in California, and my son has his degree and he works for the government.
Story_ID: 57427
Speaker 1: You know, so you - did you start with - I mean [Walter Q.] Gresham [Elementary School], was that where you started and then you ended up because you were there for -
Speaker 2: I did my - twenty years, from '67 until '86.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: I started - I did my student teaching at Gresham School. And as a student teacher, they requested that I come there and be a teacher. Well, when I graduated from college, they didn't have a position. I had to wait. Like, I guess, I graduated in June and they didn't have a position that would be available until January. So I had to go to another school. I remember the principal's name. Norm Silber, who was simply fabulous, but I don't remember the name of the school. Anyway, I started at the other school. So they both wanted me. They both said, "Monique, come and teach here. Oh, we have this for you. Come and teach here." And I thought, "Now, which one shall I do?" And one of the older educators said to me, she was an administrator, she said, "Monique you do what is best for you and your family. We would love to have you here and we want you here." The school was at 62nd and Blackstone [Chicago, Illinois]. I lived at 93rd and Green and Gresham is at 85th and Green. So I thought with the ages of my children, I'd like to be home almost as soon as they get home, or I'd like to be there when they arrive home from school, so I chose Gresham Elementary School. And then in January of 1967, I started my career there and it was an experience.
Story_ID: 57428
Speaker 1: What was the experience?
Speaker 2: The teaching? I saw the change in children. I saw parents who needed counseling, and I did counsel some of them. We had a wonderful parent organization before Local School Councils became, you know, the rule of the land. I saw people whose children were getting out of hand, who were seeking help, who didn't know where to go, or how to find help. I saw people who, some lost their jobs based upon the steel mills closing. Ford Motor Company leaving, the docks not being available anymore for people to work, and I saw them using other, what shall I say, resourcefulness, to survive. Going from working at the steel mill earning quite a bit of money to driving a cab to survive and keep your home and keep a roof over your head. I saw people that I encouraged, as adults, to go back to school and become educators. The difference in our children - I'll never forget when a child brought a gun to school, a young man. The children told me he had the weapon. And when I asked him where it was, he said, he didn't have it. So, of course, I had to explain to the children, "If you keep this secret for him, what you're going to find is your little brother or sister in a younger grade could be injured. It might not be you, but it could be a relative." So then the children told me where the weapon was. So it was signal to me that a new day is arriving. I had a little girl who came with a weapon in a brown paper bag. Some girls had been jumping on her. They were high school students. And she brought a weapon. The students told me as soon as they passed - I'm at the door on duty. And the students advised me that she had a weapon. And the saddest thing was she was the nicest, smartest girl you could ever - you would ever want to meet. But what happened was no adult, no adult took action to prevent these high school students from chasing her home every day. And even her grandmother with whom she lived worked in Skokie, Illinois. So grandmother left for work about six in the morning, got home after six at night, and here's this little girl, eighth grade, thirteen years old, alone. So she felt to protect herself this is what she needed to do. So, of course, the law didn't state that you had to be expelled, but she was expelled. But I will tell you that she came to school every day because I insisted that she be there.
Speaker 1: Now -
Speaker 2: And she's an adult today. She's quite active with her children's education. But she thanks me for not enforcing expulsion and keeping her off campus because who knows where she would be today.
Story_ID: 57429
Speaker 1: Now, what - I have several questions to ask around the education thing, and one question I have is what do you think the value of teachers are in our society.
Speaker 2: I believe that teachers are as important as the parent because when the child is left in the school all day, six hours at least, the teacher is actually the parent. The teacher is the nurturer. The teacher is the educator. The teacher is the counselor. And it is more than preparation for academic subjects. You must, in my opinion, teach that entire child. And I think if we do that, we may get a different product.
Speaker 1: And what do you think makes a good teacher?
Speaker 2: A teacher who values - who places great value on the life of every child. I'll never forget a little girl who called me the "B" word, and her objective was to be sent home. The weather was gorgeous. It was a beautiful spring day, and she was a fast little lady, and she said - I said, "Good morning. Good morning." She said, "Good morning, 'B--' "Oh, my, my! Why would you say that to me?" So I said, "I know. You want to go home, but you're not going. You're going to stay right here with me." So her punishment was to be with me really closely the entire day. Whatever I had to do, she sat there right with me in school doing her work. To me, that was much more productive than sending her home to learn some more bad words to come back and use on me. Her mother worked, her mother was trying very hard. There were older siblings. They, too, were school and work. So this little girl was on her own a lot. People forget. People forget that children have to be nurtured. It's like a flower. And if you water it and you put love and attention, it grows properly and beautifully. But if you treat it like a weed, you simply pour water on it, let the sun - it grows up any kind of way. And sometimes that's what happens with our children. They're not being nurtured. They're not being loved. They're not being appreciated. You know, I taught at a juvenile detention center for one year, and I found that those young people who were in trouble, many of them were very bright, very talented. One of them could draw a cartoon just as you would see a Mickey Mouse or any of those cartoons. He could draw it so rapidly. It was just a pleasure to watch him draw. No one had ever tapped that resource that this young man had. I asked, "Did your teachers, where the school you came from, did they know you could draw?" "No." I had some who could write poetry. I had some who could do beautiful drawings. And the principal of the school at that time, she said, "Monique how do you get this out of them?" Because, I said, "The kids are in jail," and I said to them, "but jail does not have to be in you. You have something in here. God gave all of us something." And it's up to us as teachers to bring it out. And when we don't do that, we are truly committing a crime and society suffers. Society suffers when we don't - like I've heard teachers say, "I teach English." But is that all? You're teaching a person English so that that person can use the English. But it is a person that you are teaching. And sometimes when our children come from certain environments, they have a feeling that no one cares about them. Say the school may not even look as if anybody cares about that community. That's when you have to be the most nourishing. And it does take a lot from you. It literally takes a lot. But it is so worth it. It is so worthy. You know, I've said to children and their parents, "Do you go to church?" Is that my job as an educator? I'm told it isn't, but I know that it is. Because I tell parents today, "You need help raising children today. You can't do it alone. You need the church's assistance. You need the community's assistance. And it's so important when we hear the phrase, "It takes a village to raise a child." It does, but the village has to be there. Everybody can't be out working and the village is empty of adults. There are no adults there. The village can't just say, "It takes a village." You have to actually participate. I was a 4H Club leader on my block. Those were some crazy days. (Laughter) Many children from 93rd and Green would be at my house on Saturday morning to complete a project, to practice for something. They were the Green Buccaneers. I got lots of awards as that 4H Club leader. So it's with that kind of a background I became a legislator. (Laughter)

Speaker 1: I was asking about - sort of the history in Chicago [Illinois]. It was a school system, you know, that African Americans, a lot of people just to get substitute positions for years-
Speaker 2: Well, for years in Chicago, they had an oral examination that would eliminate African American candidates in the oral interview because they had southern dialects. And those who were doing the interviewing felt that a southern dialect was objectionable. So they would make those particular teachers, what they called FTBs: Full-Time Basis substitutes. Eventually those walls came down because of people fighting against such behavior. The Chicago Public Schools have been known to have different types of racism at different periods of time. We went through a period, I felt, when [HM] Dr. Manford Byrd was a superintendent [1968 to 1990], in which a number of African Americans were able to use their talents and their skills and actually participate in the growth and development and education of children in Chicago. The Chicago Reform Movement came about during that period and the real reason was because there were some organizations that were white dominated, who wanted a piece of the pie. The budget for the Chicago Board of Education, currently, it's about 4 point something billion. So it's always been a great employment and resource for many businesses throughout the Chicago and suburban area in the state really. And I understand that Dr. Byrd refused to give some of these organizations contracts or part of this educational pie. So they came after him in the legislature, and in the legislature they passed laws that removed Dr. Byrd, that instituted a local school council, which means every school has a governing board of eleven members; the principal, two teachers, community residents and parents. That governing board approves the budget of those who - the budget of that particular school. They make recommendations in reference to the curriculum, and some people say it's a good thing, and some people say it's bad. But one of the things it did do was give the community an opportunity to actually be legitimately participating in the school process and the learning environment. So it's still kind of iffy as to the value of it. And when I say that, as an educator, in many instances, I find too often people are fighting the educational administrators or they're fighting the teachers rather than working in conjunction with them. And I think it's so important that when you talk about the education of children that one of the things, in my opinion, you try and get as many resources as you can. You try and get the best people in your particular school to work there. And if there's a lot of conflict, people don't want to be there.
Story_ID: 57431
Speaker 1: I believe that a great deal of the businesses in the community should have a larger role in providing knowledge to the educators of what their needs are, so that once people are educated they can become employed or own their own business, such as you're doing here, or develop something to contribute. But I think a lot of young people see their older brothers and sisters who did become educated who couldn't find employment, and so that's a discouragement to those coming after them. So I think we need to do more in reference to education in partnering with private industry to make sure the people we're educating will be taking a part in private industry here in our city, in our state. And also, with our local, our labor unions. There's some labor unions in the City of Chicago and the State of Illinois that fight very hard to keep African Americans out. They're still doing it. They're still doing it, and that's - it's very sad when you live in a community and there are twenty-five workers for that day who are fixing a street, who are repairing a light, and every one of those workers is white and that entire community is black. When people drive in to deliver bread. The truck and everybody is white and the people buying the bread are all black. It's what they call - it's disparity in trade and it will create problems in a community that affect those children who come to school and it affects their desire to learn. I feel that you have to see people working. You have to see people owning their own business if you, too, are going to be - have those desires and goals and work towards those goals. I mean if you look at entertainers. Many times there are children going to entertainment because that's what they've seen. You have to we have to be and have role models for our children. One of the concerns I have always had and that is the African American male and his employment. Many times he's available, he's ready, he's prepared, he's educated, but somebody else gets the position and the rules change. So we're still working with that. We're still working on that and we're still trying to work and see that greater fairness and parity occurs. Now, with the new administration in Chicago there appears to be an attempt to give more contracts, let's say, to those who have businesses in the State of Illinois or in Chicago, I should say, but it's not enough. It just is not enough.
Story_ID: 57432
Speaker 1: I want to ask you about how you even came into politics.
Speaker 2: Well, that's interesting. As an educator, we got out of school at three-fifteen. And my kids were growing up and I said, "I really would like to do something else." So after school, I started helping Independent, Democratic candidates. [HM] [United States] Congressman Gus Savage, I volunteered. We helped him. [HM] [Illinois State Representative] Monica Faith Stewart, who had this seat before I did, I volunteered to help Monica Faith Stewart. And the most remarkable one that I volunteered to help was Harold Washington. I coordinated the 21st Ward for [Chicago Mayor] Harold Washington, which included getting volunteers, setting up tea, setting up meetings, presenting his views to different churches. It was a remarkable period, and we did this without pay. I volunteered. But you see what happens when you volunteer? You never know where it will lead to. And then when he ran for Congress, I volunteered, of course, also. When I ran for office the first time, I lost. When I ran the second time, I lost. And the third time, I had learned all the things that I should do. I had put in enough effort of letting people know what my history had been; a Cub Scout den mother, a Girl Scout leader, a 4H Club leader, different block club participations, a member of Trinity United Church of Christ. And I let people know the role I had in school, the many activities I participated in. Then- and Harold Washington's endorsement, I won that election. So that's how I got into politics.
Story_ID: 57433
Speaker 1: So why was it important for you to enter the political arena?
Speaker 2: I felt that a number of things were not being addressed. One of the things that interested me was the lottery. The fact that African Americans did not win according to the dollars they were playing; that dollars were not being provided in the African American community for advertisement. They didn't spend any money with African American newspapers or radio stations. We corrected all of that. We felt that some of the educational issues that should have been confronted, they were not. So we've done a lot with that. The infant mortality rate in the black community was so very high, but it is reduced. It's not as low as it should be, but all over the state [Illinois] it is now reduced. There were many issues that I just felt that fairness was not across the board, and I thought I could lend my voice and activities to bring that fairness to the table, and I think we've done that. We were successful in bringing - think of this now - State Police to the City of Chicago. The State Police have never been located in Cook County let alone Chicago. Well, we got them to build a station at 83rd and King Drive. That's when the district was called 36. I no longer have that district. We were able to work with and support a law that allowed black judges to get elected. The judicial system kept African Americans out of office. In forging a relationship with the Republican Party and the African American caucus in the legislature, we were able to get sub-circuit judges, you know, into law and get them elected. We were able to bring dollars to the Probation Challenge program, [HM] Reverend Harold Bailey's program, Giving young people a second chance who have committed a crime and it's not severe enough where a judge needs to throw them in jail, so they're given an opportunity to attend Probation Challenge. Well, we were able to get the money for that. At Chicago State [University], the Financial Assistance Center where a student who does not know how to fill out the paperwork can go and get assistance on that Internet filling out paperwork to get federal or state funds for any college he wants to attend, not just Chicago State. So those are the kinds of activities we've been successful in completing or still working on.
Story_ID: 57434
Speaker 1: We're now working on racial profiling in the State of Illinois as well as across this country. Many times, African Americans, especially men, are stopped merely because of the color of their skin. Well, this is unfair on its face, but sometimes it moves up to a level of someone getting injured, hurt or killed. We feel that racial profiling must end, and I have put that issue on the table in the state of Illinois. Recently, some police officers from Highland Park, Illinois have said, "Yes, they have told us how to do this in Highland Park. They have told us we must do this in Highland Park." And these are Caucasian police officers who are bringing the truth to the public saying, "This is happening in Highland Park. Help us to get it stopped." Several have lost their jobs. One is being threatened with the loss of his job. So, as a legislator in the state of Illinois, I am able to present this issue to Caucasians in the legislature who don't even know what it means or feels like to be racially profiled. They don't know what it means for the officer to say, "Step out of the car. Put your hands over the hood." He finds nothing wrong, so he walks around to the other side of the car. He still finds nothing. He looks in the trunk. He may hold you there for forty minutes. Some young teenagers, who are college students, told me they've been told to sit on the curb for thirty or forty minutes. It is humiliating. It is dehumanizing. It is embarrassing, and I feel that, as a legislator, I have the duty and the responsibility to address that issue.
Story_ID: 57435
Speaker 1: Do you know [HM] Charles Branham?
Speaker 2: Charles?
Speaker 1: Branham.
Speaker 2: He's a history professor?
Speaker 1: He's a history professor.
Speaker 2: Yes, I've met him.
Speaker 1: And he actually did his doctoral thesis on the first hundred years of the Illinois General Assembly. And he has - you know we're using him as a consultant on this project. But his theory was that we were in a fourth stage of, you know, when you go back to the beginning of Johnny - John W. [E.] Thomas to here. That there were, you know, that we're in a stage where people, you know, the black legislators are more independent, they're more - they address issues. And I was just wondering if you could sort of speak to that in your colleagues.
Speaker 2: Well, first, I'd like to say I'm an Independent Democrat. Now, some people say, "Well, what is an independent Democrat?" I'm an Independent Democrat, one that was not selected by the Democratic Party. Even though I'm a member of that Party, I was not selected to run. In fact, up until recently, they always had a candidate to run against me and we always won after that first time. I believe that the new legislators are not from what they called, and I hate to use this word, but it's so true, a "plantation." In other words, there were times, there were times in the Illinois General Assembly when the black members were simply there holding a seat and someone else always told them what the issue was, or how they would vote on any issue. I think a major difference is someone else telling you what the issue is rather than you having an agenda and knowing what your issues are. I think you pick that up.
Story_ID: 57436
Speaker 1: Another issue, of course, that we're inching into the [Illinois] General Assembly is reparations. Now, surely the Democratic Party is not going to say, "This is our agenda and you're going to support it." Reparations should be an agenda item of African Americans in every general assembly in the United States of America. Now, some people say, "Well, I don't want a mule" and - whatever that slang or term was. What they don't realize is your labor, your forced labor affected the outcome and result of what and how your children can contribute today. And I'm not saying you must give money, but I do believe some sort of educational accommodations should be made where the child of any slave or, you know, relative should be able to attend a vocational school, a college, a university, or they should be allowed to, say, borrow money to start a business without a high interest rate or any interest rate, perhaps. But it has to be some accommodation. And the reason today it has to be done is because it's been done for every other group that was mistreated. It has been done for the Japanese. It has been done for the Jewish community, and it has to be done to bring America upright. You know, America is still tilting from the wrongs it has done to human beings. And because it's tilting, in order to be stood up properly and to get itself morally right and adjusted, then it certainly should pass legislation on reparations. So I agree with my sister, [HM] Dorothy Tillman, who has passed legislation in the [Chicago] City Council just as I have done in the General Assembly. So the difference I think in some legislatures from years past and today is we have the authority and the knowledge and the responsibility to set another agenda; an agenda that will advance the African American community. There are - for example, there are programs, there are groups that are being funded because we are there. And to think that you have a state budget of forty-something billion dollars, billion dollars and that your community is getting little or none of that is unheard of. And even though, even though we're what? There are twenty-six African Americans in the entire General Assembly, about fourteen in the House of Representatives. And someone recently wrote an article and said, "It's so tragic that the African American community don't have the numbers." Well, let's think about it. It takes sixty votes to pass a bill, and without some of those African Americans, those sixty votes to pass a bill are not there, and that's because the Democrats are in charge of the House. I want that to be perfectly clear. The Black Caucus and the General Assembly has a great opportunity to forge relationships, compromises, and to reach some conclusions based upon their ability or our ability to be the sixty votes that are needed in the House. Now, the Senate right now is a little different. But, you know, we still have to be proud, I think, of the fact that we had another president, a president, a black president of the Senate, Cecil Partee, that did occur. And we could have another African American president of the Senate if we could just get those numbers, you know, lined up properly. We'd make a major difference in that body because sometimes things might never become - ever become legislation. But we've met around a table or we've met in a room and we've discussed some issues like, "This can't be because it's wrong. This will harm the African American community."
Story_ID: 57437
Speaker 1: So we're not just there to vote no, but we're there to be important delegates from the community that we're elected from, and I'm proud to say that I'm elected from a district that's forty percent Caucasian and sixty percent African American. And yet, with that, I get the highest vote in the General Assembly of those one hundred eighteen members. And only one time since I've been elected, I didn't get the highest, I got the second highest. The Republicans swept. I think it was 1994 and I was number two. But every other election, Monique D. Davis come in with the highest vote, and I think it's because my community recognizes that even if it doesn't make me popular with those I serve with in the [Illinois] General Assembly, I try and do the moral - what shall I say - the right thing for integrity and in order to make sure my community is properly represented. Things are not done easy. I mean to get that police station on 83rd and King, we had to use some language that we don't like to use with people, but they used it back with us, but they had to know we meant business. They wanted to put a public aid office there and the people of Chatham [Illinois], whom I represented at that time, the people of Chatham said, "We don't need a public aid office here because the majority of our people are working. We know that an office is needed, but the majority of us don't need it. Put it where the majority of the people do need it." Now that makes common sense, doesn't it? So what we did was continue to fight with the governor's office, who was Governor [Jim] Edgar at the time. And didn't take legislation, it took meetings. They were invited to community meetings. We went to meetings with the governor and his office, but the job got done. We put a State Police office at 83rd and King Drive, which had never been done.
Story_ID: 57438
Speaker 1: Library. The Carter G. Woodson Library [in Chicago, Illinois]. There's a Vivian Harsh Collection. I know you know what that is. It's the largest African American collection of historical facts, poetry, literature written by or about African American people. So we got money to buy land right next to the library to expand that collection. We had been told by the librarian and others that the collection was deteriorating because the temperature was not the correct temperature. The space was not the correct space. We were able to help forge a relationship with the city government, state government and community organizations to build an addition for the Vivian Harsh Collection, and I am most proud of that achievement. Now there were some people who wanted to say, "Well, you just don't need all that books. You need to get rid of some of the books. You got too much material." How can you say that about a people who have worked so hard in this country, who have done so much, who have created so much, who are so talented? You know, when I go into the Vivian Harsh room and I go for one thing, I need to look up this, it's so hard to leave. It just captures you when you read all that's available in that room and you see sometimes the art work or the exhibits that are presented and allowed for them to use. So these are the kinds of things we do. The DuSable Museum [of African American History]. We were able to get, ooh, ooh, big bundles of money for them, for them to build another wing. And [HM] Dr. [Margaret] Burroughs is so grateful and we're so grateful to her. And then, of course, Chicago State [University]. They will be getting a new library, a new convocation center, and that's based upon our efforts to tap into the appropriations in the Illinois General Assembly.
Story_ID: 57439
Speaker 1: It [the Vivian Harsh Collection] actually should mirror it [Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, New York Public Library]. But you would be surprised sometimes at the battles that occur when you're attempting to provide that kind of resource in the African American community. Now, I must say that the legislators have been extremely supportive. The process that you go through for appropriations is quite, shall I say, intense. Many meetings, removal of your project, many meetings to get it put back in. And I'm the chairperson of Human Service Appropriation in the city of - I'm sorry - in the State of Illinois. So all state agencies that are a part of the human service community come before my committee for their resources, and I find that being the chair of that committee helps me. I learn a great deal about what people are doing in reference to the lead in the water that our children drink. Are the children being tested, and is something being done about it if they find they do have lead? We find that we put dollars into the osteoporosis for women, the breast examinations. I mean `we're trying to put money - and recently we have about seven hundred and fifty thousand for an AIDS program for the African American community group, you know, where it's rising so fast. But it's so important, in my opinion, that we realize we have this ability, we have this capability. I have given over a hundred scholarships to children going to state institutions. And just being there, we fought to keep that scholarship alive. They tried to kill it. They don't want to give state scholarships. Well, why not? There are all kinds of dollars being given away of state money. We give money to private institutions and we cannot - I should say - I will say, we cannot remove the opportunity for scholarships for children in African American or less affluent communities because without that our communities will die. If we don't continue to get an education, our communities will not live.
Story_ID: 57440
Speaker 1: You were very, you know, you were very effective, I should say, in your, you know, description of the black legislators as they exist today. What comment do you have about those from the time of John W. [E.] Thomas till now and those that came before you?
Speaker 2: Well, I believe those who came before me operated, perhaps, in a fashion in which they could survive. In other words, they were given - they were allowed to serve by the party, picked by the party, the party made them win. Maybe, I'm not sure, African Americans didn't vote to the degree they vote today or to the degree that they should. You see, in order to be an Independent legislator, you've got to make sure that you're not dependent on the party to deliver you because, if you are, then you have got to be just what they say, when they say, and how to say it. I think it's so important that we appreciate them who came before us. We understand that Corneal Davis and Margaret Smith's husband [Fred Smith] couldn't even get into a hotel. That they had to sleep in cars because - it's so hard for me to even fathom being a State Legislator, making the laws for the state, abolishing laws, dividing up a budget and you can't stay in the hotel. Well, that saddens me. Sometimes I understand Illinois because my understanding is we were one vote away from being a slave state. One vote would have made the state of Illinois a slave state like Mississippi, Missouri. And it baffles me sometimes how human beings could treat other human beings that way. So I really applaud our first legislators. I feel they came through during a period, perhaps, of turmoil, when African Americans were in the most need, when many of us were not knowledgeable about our right to vote, our responsibility to vote, where there were so many shenanigans in place to keep us from voting or registering to vote. I applaud them. I applaud them, I applaud the contributions they made. I applaud the hurt and suffering they must have gone through. But I do know that preceding me, for example, Charlie Chew [State Senator Charles Chew] and Russ Ewell - not Russ Ewell but [HM] Ray Ewell, Raymond Ewell, and I know him very well, Cecil Partee, Charlie Chew. These were some of the smartest men that you'd ever want to meet. You talk about brain power. They had brain power. And it takes a mental ability to get around all of the forces that are opposing you. So I admire them, I appreciate the groundwork that they laid. I think they did a yeoman's job and they are to be well respected.
Story_ID: 57441
Speaker 1: Okay. What is your legacy?
Speaker 2: You know, one of the pieces of legislation that I passed, the drug paraphernalia bill, and that law prohibits the sale of drug paraphernalia in the State of Illinois. There was a time you could go in and just buy this merchandise off the shelf, leading little children to believe it was okay. So I believe part of our legacy, hopefully, will be that life is valuable, important, and that education is significant in improving the quality of life for all people. My work is so varied. Even though - I'm Vice Chair of Elementary-Secondary Education. I'm on the Financial Institution's Committee. I sit on the Public Utility Committee where we're constantly trying to make those public utilities be fair to the constituents and the residents of the State of Illinois. I want my legacy to be that an African American woman from a poor childhood with a loving family, one who was encouraged to get an education has taken some time to become a legislator and represent her people; meaning the Caucasians in the 19th and 18th Ward, meaning the African Americans in the 21st and 34th Ward. It has been a phenomenally important, rewarding experience for me. And I think if many women and many people realized the capability and the talent that they have, and all of us should develop that talent that we have and decide that we're going to make a contribution in this world to make life better for someone. And I think I've done that. I've helped to educate people. I've given scholarships to young people. And I'm not one of those who says, "Oh, they got to have A's before I give them a scholarship. No, because I know a C+ student, a B student, they will make a major contribution to our society. And I'd like my legacy to be that I fought for the rights of people and especially children.
