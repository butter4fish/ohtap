Speaker 1: Now before we go into depth, there are five lightweight questions we always ask that only require a short answer.  First one is do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: (Pause) No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Black and blue.
Speaker 1: Okay.  A favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Not really, not really.
Speaker 1: Okay.  A favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: I don't generally take vacations, except now I'm getting old enough I can take one.  And that's probably the Virgin Islands.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  The last question is do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Yes: there is no traffic on the extra mile.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And my other famous saying is: a good name is better to be chosen than all the riches of the world.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Those are the two.  One is a--book of Proverbs [Proverbs 22:1].
Story_ID: 653127
Speaker 1: Now, I'm gonna ask about your family history.
Speaker 2: (Cough) (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I'm gonna ask about your, (unclear) about your mother's side of the family and your father's side, but separately; then we'll put them together.  Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: Nellie Maud Gaines is her, is her maiden name.
Speaker 1: And how do you spell that?
Speaker 2: Nellie, N-E-L-L-I-E, M-A-U-D, Gaines, G-A-I-N-E-S [Nellie Gaines Howard].
Speaker 1: All right.  And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: I don't remember.  I wrote it down, but what do you want me to do?  Get it from my--?
Speaker 1: No, no just--can you give us her father's name (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) She was about--she was seventy-nine [years old] when she pa- seventy-one when she passed away.  I have to look it up; I really didn't remember.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You were born in '39 [1939], so was she born in the teens [1910s], nineteen teens [1910s]?
Speaker 2: Well I have it written--I know what it is 'cause I have it in my--I, I have it, if you'll give me a minute I could--
Speaker 1: No, no we were just gonna keep on going.  We're not gonna stop and do that.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But--so I--we just assume she was born in the nineteen teens [1910s]; and was she born in Marietta?
Speaker 2: She was born in Marietta, Oklahoma.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What can you tell us about your mother's side of the family in terms of how far back you can trace them and what (unclear)?
Speaker 2: I can't trace them back very far.  I mean I do have--I'm starting to put together a family tree of the family.  But I don't much information on either family, my mother or my father's side.  My mother lived in, most of the time in Burneyville, Oklahoma.  That's where she was, was raised I think.  And I never did know my grandfather, her father.
Speaker 1: Do you know what he did for a living?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Probably most of 'em were sharecroppers or farmers or some, some type.  But, I, I do not know.  I don't ever recall meeting him.
Speaker 1: Did she talk about being raised on the farm or?
Speaker 2: No, she didn't talk about it.  But that's where I--when--we, we have a summer vacation, I'd always go down to where Papa Sam [Samuel Gaines] was--he had a farm.  And he probably had some crops in Oklahoma.
Speaker 1: Okay, this is--your grandfather was known as Papa Sam (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah, Papa Sam.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Okay--so now--so--is--and this is at--in Burn-?
Speaker 2: Burneyville.
Speaker 1: Burneyville?  How--?
Speaker 2: Burneyville, that's B-U-R-N-E-Y-V-I-L-L-E.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It's right outside of--it's in Love County [Oklahoma], outside of Ardmore, Oklahoma.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well you say she was born in Marietta?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Marietta is, is the county seat.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She probably could've been born in mar- Burneyville, you know, but I, I--that's where we generally say most of my family was coming, from Marietta.  My father [Houston Howard] was born in Ryan [Oklahoma], which is, which is right down in--same, same county.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, we'll get to him.  So, so there's no other--there's no stories about your family coming from some other place (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No.  No.
Speaker 1: --or, or that they came here from, you know?
Speaker 2: No I don't know any stories about them.  I never pursued anything about them.  We never talked about it.
Speaker 1: They never talked about how they got to Oklahoma?
Speaker 2: No.  They never talked about how they got to Oklahoma.
Story_ID: 653128
Speaker 1: It's interesting 'cause Oklahoma being Indian [Native American] territory at one time, it seems like there's a story there somewhere.
Speaker 2: There probably is, we never did--my, my mother [Nellie Gaines Howard] just--she worked, she was a maid most of her life when it was--partic- particularly when we were in Lawton [Oklahoma].  And she was the one who taught us more about Christ and the Bible.  And she was the one that had that famous phrase that I say, "A good name is better to be chosen than all the riches of the world" [Proverbs 22:1].  That's what she would preach into me and I really never knew much about it until I really got to college [Oklahoma State University, Stillwater, Oklahoma] and I, and I began to appreciate what she was talking about.
Speaker 1: Do you think there's a story in her life that, that made that phrase important to her?
Speaker 2: That's, it's her belief in Christ; and she taught our--that was one of her strong suits, is her Christian, Christian faith.
Speaker 1: But you know, a phrase like that being your favorite phrase, it seems to suggest that there was a struggle at one time with your reputation and you were able to vindicate yourself.
Speaker 2: Well, I never had a very negative reputation 'cause I was always a good kid (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Not you, I'm talking about your mother.
Speaker 2: It could be.  I don't know.  I just don't know.  I really don't know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I, I don't think she had it 'cause she was a, she was a strong Christian; and I understood, couldn't imagine her having anything negative about her in her lifetime, so.
Speaker 1: Or maybe some relative or some (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, it could be; yeah.
Speaker 1: --some situation that made her, you know--
Speaker 2: I don't know.
Speaker 1: --uphold that particular phrase.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: But, now, did your mother have a chance to go to school?
Speaker 2: I think she went to--probably down in Burneyville [Oklahoma], but I don't know much about the school.  I think she finished twelfth grade--I think.  But she never talked about school, she just--
Speaker 1: But she could (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) she never went to college, she never even thought about going to college.  She's often wondered why I went to college (laughter) she couldn't appreciate what education would do.
Speaker 1: Well was she a reader?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Except the Bible.
Speaker 1: Okay, but she read--well--
Speaker 2: Yeah, the Bible was the only thing she was, she would read.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We had no magazines, we didn't take the newspaper, any of that stuff.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, so she was fiercely religious?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And my, my brothers and my siblings--brothers [sic.] and I, we all got that from her.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What denomination was she?
Speaker 2: Baptist.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 653129
Speaker 1: Your mother [Nellie Gaines Howard] started working early in life I guess you were saying (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, I think she did, she had to 'cause sh- we were poor; and I've just known her, you know--I recall just her working as a maid in Lawton, Oklahoma--that's where we lived most of my life.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now is Lawton a all-black town?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Or, or was it at one time?
Speaker 2: It was never.  Lawton is right near Fort Sill [Oklahoma], which is a artillery and guided missile center of the world, that's where that is.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  I know it's a lot of--one time there were over thirty black towns in Oklahoma.
Speaker 2: Yeah there are some, Boley, Oklahoma, black--all-black town, some place like that; but, but we were in more in the southwestern part of the state and we were basically--you had Fort Sill, you had an Indian [Native American] reservation or two there in the area.  But Fort Sill was where the--was the big employer at the town.  Lawton was probably the third or fourth largest city in the State of Oklahoma at that time (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Probably still around that too.
Speaker 1: All right.  So you'd be talking about Oklahoma City [Oklahoma]; Tulsa [Oklahoma]?
Speaker 2: Oklahoma City; Tulsa; Muskogee [Oklahoma]; Edmond [Oklahoma]; Ardmore [Oklahoma].  Ardmore is on the southeastern side of the state.  And I went to school at Oklahoma State [Oklahoma State University], which is up at Stillwater [Oklahoma], which is really the northeastern part of the state.
Story_ID: 653130
Speaker 1: Now, what about your [maternal] grandmother [Callie Gaines], did, any information about (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I don't know.  I don't know anything about my grandmother.
Speaker 1: Was she, had she passed before you came along?
Speaker 2: Yes, apparently so, 'cause I just don't remember ever meeting her.
Speaker 1: So there are no stories about her.  Nobody ever talked about her?
Speaker 2: Nobody ever talked about her.
Speaker 1: Hm, that's--every- seems like people always honor their mother, so this (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah we never, we never, I just don't recall any stories about them at all--I mean I--
Speaker 1: What she was like or what she look like or anything?
Speaker 2: Nothing.
Speaker 1: You know, where she worked, or?
Speaker 2: Nothing.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Okay.  But your [maternal] grandfather, though, you did, did know him.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I just know Papa, Papa Sam [Samuel Gaines].
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: But not much, you know he was a farmer too so.  But, but I, I don't recall 'em--much--most of the time we went back to Okla- to Burneyville [Oklahoma] or Marietta [Oklahoma] during the summertime.  When we were living in Lawton we could go down there for two or three weeks for the summer.  We got to meet, meet our unc- our--children, cousins and that kind of thing and that's about all.
Speaker 1: Did your mother come from a large family?
Speaker 2: Let's see.  There are quite a few, let's see she had a twin brother [Willie Gaines],  and two, three other brothers.  So it was not that significantly large family.
Speaker 1: Be four or five (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) But they were all workers; they were all farmers, they were all farmers.  We had horses, cows.
Speaker 1: Did, did they own their own land there?
Speaker 2: No.  They just sharecropped I guess.
Speaker 1: Or were they renting?  There's a difference.
Speaker 2: Probably renting, I, I don't know the, the legal title 'cause they--we didn't own--we didn't know we had any land anyway (laughter).  We never owned any house until we went to Lawton, Oklahoma.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 653131
Speaker 1: Well let me go to your father's side.  Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Houston Howard: H-O-U-S-T-O-N, H-O-W-A-R-D.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: His is--his bla- place of birth is Ryan, Oklahoma, which is in Love County [Oklahoma].  Love County is--Marietta [Oklahoma], county seat.  And let's see, I think his birthday was in October 17th or 19th.  And I'm trying to think.  I wanna say--I just don't remember the date of birth.  He died about seventy-one [years old] of cancer, so I don't remember much about him.
Speaker 1: Probably the nineteen teens [1910s], don't you think?
Speaker 2: Yeah nine- I'm thinking 1917 but I can't--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --can't verify that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So he was--your, your mother [Nellie Gaines Howard] and father were both young when you were born?
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: Right.  Okay.  So--
Speaker 2: I was the oldest child.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Of the, of the two.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Of the--of that relationship.
Speaker 1: All right.  So--well what, what do you know about your dad's side of the family (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) He was just a laborer.  We had a farm with his--we farmed with his father, Beda Howard in Ryan, Oklahoma.  Then he left there and went to (unclear)--I mean to Sanger, Texas; and then he left there and went Lawton, Oklahoma.  But he was a laborer, he worked at Montgomery Wards [Montgomery Ward] for twenty-five years, and got a watch.  And, and basically, all he did was mount tires.
Speaker 1: Okay.  This is your grandfather?
Speaker 2: My father.
Speaker 1: Oh your father, okay.
Speaker 2: My grandfather just--had raised peanuts on a farm.  It was not his land or, I guess he must've rented it.  And we used to go down there every summer.  See, we could see my mother's parents [Callie Gaines and Samuel Gaines], we spent a week with them; and then we'd spend another week with my father's parents; and then came back to Lawton, Oklahoma.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So he raised peanuts (unclear)?
Speaker 2: I used to chop peanuts.
Speaker 1: All right.  Now, what about your grandmother on your father's side?
Speaker 2: She was just a housewife.
Speaker 1: What was her name?
Speaker 2: Her name was Mollie, M-O-L-L-I-E, Howard [Mollie Howard].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Was she from around that same area?
Speaker 2: I'm assuming so, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So now did your dad get a chance to go to school or anything?
Speaker 2: He went to tenth grade I think.
Speaker 1: And--now was the school--their high school in Lawton?
Speaker 2: Yes, in Lawton.  But they--we were--they went, they went to school probably more in Marietta, 'cause when we got to school in Lawton, I started--I was going to school in Lawton.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I had--
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, now, well, so did your father serve in the war [World War II, WWII]?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No.  My father was just--he was a laborer, that's all he did, just worked.  One of the best, one of the best attributes I've ever learned.  He taught me about work.
Speaker 1: That's what we did in the war, pretty much, you know.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Yeah.
Speaker 1: Tuskegee Airmen, everybody was a laborer--
Speaker 2: Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) in the war.
Story_ID: 653132
Speaker 1: Is there a story about how your parents met, or how they fell in love?
Speaker 2: I don't know, I do not know.  They never talked about it.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, all right.
Speaker 2: We, we--you know, I just don't recall ever sitting around a dinner table and talking like we do today.  My father [Houston Howard] worked most of the time, and my mother [Nellie Gaines Howard] worked during the day as a maid.  So I just, I just don't recall anything.  They went, they went to--in my family, in Lawton, Oklahoma, my mother and father went to one church; and we went to another church.  It was kind of--that's kind of unusual but the church we went to was down the street from our house, Bethlehem Baptist Church in Lawton, Oklahoma.  And they went to Union Baptist Church which, is in Lawton View [Lawton, Oklahoma]; but--so we kind of raised ourselves in a way.  We were not, we were not wealthy.  We had--(laughter) we didn't have anything.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So well when you think about what your parents looked like, what they walked like, what their attitudes were, what talents they had and their sense of humor, what they were interested in, who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: Well I take after my father in terms of the work ethic.  We, we, we are not--we're quiet people.  My father was a quiet person.  He--we would be at home, he would be--he would sit in the room, he probably would never say a word; he'd just sit there and watch his children.  And we're, we're that kind of family.  We can be by ourselves.  And, and my daughter [Anica Howard] takes after him.  I take after him.  And my mother, she was always cleaning, cleaning the house, preparing the meals for us and humming a hymn.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But, but we, we just did not--I mean was not the families like you have today; they, this--church was our outlet.  That's all, church was our outlet, we didn't much anything else.  I went to work.  I started to work when I was about, about eleven, twelve years old.  I was working myself (laughter) and I learned how to work and my father is--he had two or three jobs so he needed the two or three jobs to make ends meet for us.  He was at Montgomery Wards [Montgomery Ward], and he washed windows at the retail stores downtown; then he worked at Fort Sill sometimes at night washing dishes.  So he worked most of the time.  I learned that.  I took that from him.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Nobody can work harder than me.
Story_ID: 653133
Speaker 1: Did your parents have special roles in the church?
Speaker 2: Let's see, my mother [Nellie Gaines Howard] was--you know, the- they had these women in the church who are sisters to the pastor or si- so she did that.  My father [Houston Howard] was an usher.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's all.
Speaker 1: Was your mother like a member of the altar guild, or--where they (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, I, I, oh they always wore white (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yeah, right.
Speaker 2: So that's all I remember.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: But since we didn't go to their church, that's what I know they did, from, from the way they, they talked.  And then but they came to our church when we had our--when we were young kids we were in church programs.  They would come down there, participate with us.  We went to our church in Lawton, Oklahoma, which was essentially right down the street from where we lived.
Speaker 1: Now is that your father's church?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Your--okay.  I'm just understanding, so--
Speaker 2: My mother and father went to one church, Union Baptist Church.  My sisters [Callie Howard and Lula Howard] and brother [Maurice Howard] and I went to Bethlehem Baptist Church [Lawton, Oklahoma].  Union Baptist Church was in Lawton View, Oklahoma [Lawton View, Lawton, Oklahoma]; and we were in Lawton on Arlington Avenue.
Speaker 1: Now, how did that happen--I mean (unclear)?
Speaker 2: We just joined that church.  I joined the church, and the kids followed--my brothers and sisters followed me.
Speaker 1: And your parents didn't say, "Well no, we--our family belongs to Union Baptist" (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No.  That's yeah, that, that was not a problem.  It just didn't cause a problem in our family.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: 'Cause the church was--we wanted--if we wanted to go to Sunday school, we didn't have cars to go to Lawton View.  Lawton View was about, let's say twenty miles away--maybe it's not twenty, maybe it's more like fifteen.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  So how did they get there?
Speaker 2: They we- they drove to church.
Speaker 1: Oh they dro- okay.
Speaker 2: But we walked to our church 'cause it right down the street.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But--well you could've--couldn't you have caught a ride with your parents too?
Speaker 2: Where?
Speaker 1: I mean to, to the other church?
Speaker 2: But we didn't, we didn't, we did not go to that church--it was not as easy to go to that church as it was to go down the street, Bethlehem Baptist Church.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We have no--there's no reason to go to that--go to Union Baptist Church when we had this church that we could go to.  We participated in Sunday programs.  I sang in the choir.  My sisters and brothers sang in the choir.  We were all active.  The whole family was baptized in that church--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --by Reverend O.B. Davis, I think it's (laughter).
Speaker 1: All right.  Now this is Bethlehem Baptist Church?
Speaker 2: Bethlehem Baptist Church.  Yes, sir.
Story_ID: 653134

Speaker 2: Yeah, well, I have a sister, Lula Ann (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And the oldest, start, start with the oldest, and yourself in there too.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I'm starting with the oldest.  Lula is the oldest--I'm the oldest one in the family.  Lula is the second oldest in the family.

My second sister is Callie Lee Howard, C-A-L-L-I-E, L-E-E, Howard [Callie Howard], and she's in Lawton, Oklahoma today, she's a--and then my brother is Maurice Howard, he's fifty-nine I think years old, and he lives in Oklahoma City [Oklahoma]--or Midwest City, Oklahoma, which is right outside of Oklahoma City.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: And Maur- Maurice was married to a young lady and she's passed away, so he's single right now.  Callie is single, she has some children.  Her husband is--one is passed away, and the other one is just divorced.  Cal- Lula is married and in, in New York, in Hempstead, New York and she's still married to the one that she initially married.  And I'm the oldest--

Speaker 2: Well, I don't recall any side of town, I mean we were in the black neighborhood.  We were, we were near the railroad track.  And we went to school, all at the same school: Douglass high school [Douglass School, Lawton, Oklahoma] was K-1 through K-12 (laughter) K through twelve [kindergarten through twelfth grade] as--was the school.
Speaker 1: K-12 (laughter)?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Named after Frederick Dou- Douglass [Frederick Douglass]?
Speaker 2: I, I probably so, but I don't remember.
Speaker 1: Okay, k through twelve, okay.  Yeah, that's quite a range, K through twelve.
Speaker 2: Yeah you had 'em all.  Everybody was in the same school, you know; and, and we went to school there all the way.  All the way.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So you lived in the same neighborhood your whole--?
Speaker 2: Yeah most of the--yeah, yeah we, we did, we lived on Arlington Street [sic. Arlington Avenue], the principal of the school [John Sadberry] lived across the street from us.  And then we were renting in that place, at Arlington.  But then we moved to Carver Street [sic. Carver Avenue], where we--my father [Houston Howard] bought a house and--516 Carver Street in Lawton and my daught- my--Callie Lee [Howard's sister, Callie Howard] lives there right now, and she takes care of the house.
Speaker 1: Now--
Speaker 2: And that's the on- he bought that house in that we paid for it over time and that is the only property that came out of that marriage [to Howard's mother, Nellie Gaines Howard].
Speaker 1: How old were you when your family moved to Carver Street?
Speaker 2: Oh, I was myself probably more like about twelve--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --twelve years old.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you grew up in--on the other street?
Speaker 2: Yeah pretty much.
Speaker 1: Pretty much, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I mean--we--and we, we still kept going to the church at Bethlehem Baptist [Bethlehem Baptist Church, Lawton, Oklahoma]--'cause we could still get to church, 'cause it's right down the street from where I lived.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So what, what kind of house--well what kind of houses did you live in--I mean what was the first one like and the second one like?
Speaker 2: First one was a pretty big house, it was a rental house.  And I remember very little about it except the fact that (laughter) lot of trees in the backyard.  And we were right near the railroad track, you could hear the, you know, the trains all the time.  The second house was--we had one, two, three bedrooms, and, and a garage.  But this was--my father wanted to be where he could own his own property.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that's, that's what he wanted to do.  And we all lived there and grew up there.  And we would walk to school.  We didn't have a bus, no buses carry you. Walk in the rain, sleet, snow, you'd walk to school.

Speaker 1: Now did the railroad tracks separate the, the black community from, from the white community?
Speaker 2: The railroad track separated the black from the black community too (laughter).
Speaker 1: Really?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's right, you know, but we were at--the railroad track is just--was--train just came through town.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It just came through town.
Speaker 1: I know in Tulsa [Oklahoma], you know--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --when they read about the riot, the train track was what separated one side of town--the black side of town from the white side of town.
Speaker 2: Yeah but we, we--
Speaker 1: It's like that in a lot of places (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah but we, we--the whites lived more off of--there's a street that goes through--2nd Avenue [sic. 2nd Street], which goes through town [Lawton, Oklahoma].  Whites on the other side of that street, blacks were in--on s- on the right side of 2nd Avenue; and then the train track would still run through the black community.  More, the wealthier blacks lived on one side of the tracks, and we lived on the other side.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: And the school [Douglass School, Lawton, Oklahoma] was on the other side of the tracks.
Speaker 1: Now we always ask this question: what were some of the sights, and sounds, and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: I don't have many, except I--railroad track, it was that I remem- (laughter).  I remember one time running across the railroad track in front of a train, and, and the school principal heard about it, not the principal--Mr. Johnson [Albert Johnson] heard about, and he prepared to discipline me the next day at the ch- at school.  And I remember that very vividly 'cause I've--and even talk to him about it a lot today.  But you--it was a stupid thing for me to do, but just ran right out across--in front of a train.  The other thing I guess is I worked at Mrs. Johnson's grocery store [ph.], and, and that I just--only made eight dollars, eight dollars a week when working in that grocery store.  But that was my source of income (unclear).
Speaker 1: Is this the same Johnson that was a principal?
Speaker 2: No there's another Johnson.
Speaker 1: Another Johnson?  Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.  One's Octavia Johnson [ph.].  Sadberry [John Sadberry] was the principal's name.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Sadberry was the principal's name.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That was one of the principals.
Speaker 1: Now how do you spell that?
Speaker 2: S-A-D-B-E-R-R-Y.  Sadberry was the principal.  Sadberry, he, he moved on to Oklahoma City [Oklahoma].  But Sadberry used to teach me never be satisfied.  He'd walk up and down the hall and like you have, you know, in school where you have--everybody goes to assembly and he would teach--walk up and down the hall never be satisfied; always keep striving, never become satisfied in anything that you do.  And, and, you know, that was me I mean I, I focused on working for myself 'cause I had to provide for myself.  And then education--but I didn't--I was not thinking about college I just wanted to get through high school and get myself a job like my father [Houston Howard].  'Cause I didn't see any future in anything else.  Did we have a television?  I don't--I recall a TV, black and white.  But I don't recall anybody looking at it much.  I mean, sitting around the television at night looking at it.
Speaker 1: So you, you wouldn't have had one 'til--oh, god you'd had to been about twelve, thirteen [years old] anyway at the point you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah.  But I--
Speaker 1: --got a TV.
Speaker 2: But, you know, we would go to the movies, we'd--we may go to the movies with a dime.  But you'd go up the back steps and look down in the movie theater over--through a glass.  You didn't--whites went downstairs, they were downs- downstairs.  But we were--the blacks were upstairs.
Speaker 1: Through a glass?
Speaker 2: Yeah we would look through a glass.
Speaker 1: Right.  Okay what--they had a glass barrier around the balcony?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I've heard, and I don't know (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It was the Ritz Theatre [Lawton, Oklahoma]--I think it was the Ritz.
Speaker 1: I've heard that black people often would throw their popcorn down on the white people if they were in the balcony.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) That may be the reason they put glass up there.
Speaker 1: I've heard that story--I must've heard fifty times.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: People would--if they were called a name or something like that, they, they throw their popcorn down on--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --you know, and it's not--so they probably put the (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) They probably did.  But we--but you had to walk up the back steps to get to the movie.  But that was, that was, that was a Saturday event if you had the time or the money to do it.
Speaker 1: That's something, if they put a glass--this is the first time I heard of the glass barrier.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Maybe the only one that I--
Speaker 2: (Laughter) That's right.
Speaker 1: But in, in the Ritz Theatre?
Speaker 2: It was the Ritz Theatre downtown.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You'd wa- and you'd walk to it, 'cause we didn't have cars.  Daddy and--Mother [Nellie Gaines Howard] had her car to go to work and Daddy had his car.  And--but they would--they'll--both of 'em be working.  Mother on Saturday and Sunday--Saturday; Sunday she was at church [Union Baptist Church, Lawton, Oklahoma].  Our father would be at church with her, and we would be at church at Bethlehem Baptist Church [Lawton, Oklahoma].

Speaker 1: Is there a black school [HBCU] in Lawton [Oklahoma], is there?
Speaker 2: Lawton, well Douglass high school [Douglass School, Lawton, Oklahoma] was a s-
Speaker 1: No, I'm talking about a college, another black institution (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No.
Speaker 1: No?  Okay.
Speaker 2: The col- the black college in the state was in Langston [Oklahoma].
Speaker 1: Langston, right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's up about twenty miles from Stillwater, Oklahoma.
Speaker 1: Okay, yeah, Langston University.
Speaker 2: Langston, yeah, they've really built the school up now.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So, so the theater [Ritz Theatre, Lawton, Oklahoma]--now was there a black business strip?
Speaker 2: Oh there probably were.  I think it's more on Gore Street [sic. Gore Boulevard], I think that's where they were.
Speaker 1: There's usually a strip where there's, you know--
Speaker 2: Yeah, barber shop.  And beer, alcohol was sold.  But, but I can't even remember the name of the street, except I think it was around 2nd [Avenue] (gesture), maybe it was Gore Street.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So now--I mean, I know the 1930s, or the mid-1930s one of the devastating, you know, events in the country took place in Oklahoma, the Dust Bowl, right?  But you, you were born in '39 [1939], I don't know if--
Speaker 2: (Shakes head) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --if it was, you know, if Oklahoma was still going through that at the time?
Speaker 2: I don't recall anything about a Dust Bowl.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I mean, weather was cold (laughter).  The weather was cold.
Speaker 1: It was cold?
Speaker 2: Yeah, you know, it was just--Oklahoma is just flat plains, for the most part, you know; and you can--that wind, wind can come off that, off of the rivers and lakes, and it's cold.
Speaker 1: Okay, dry?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 653138
Speaker 1: Okay, now you started high school--I mean your--star- started school at Douglass [Douglass School, Lawton, Oklahoma] and finished at Douglass.
Speaker 2: Finished at Douglass, right (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah.  Did you like school?
Speaker 2: Yes, I did well in school.  I mean, I played in the band, in the band.  I was offi- president of the student council and a leader in the school; played football whole time in there, you know, my whole time in school.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You had good grades I guess?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I was an honor student all the way through, and a good attendance, school.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Even after you starting working and everything?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Did- you just did all of it.  Remember I told you about my father [Houston Howard] teaching--he can do, you can do a lot of things and that's--I, I was able to do the school work.  And I was able to go to work in the morning before--I'd go to work, go home and dress, go to s- walk to school and leave school and come and work for Mrs. Johnson [Octavia Johnson (ph.)] in the afternoon.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you started before in the morn- in the early morning (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, I'd go at seven o'clock.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I think school started about eight.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you--well wait a minute, so you, you would work for her from seven--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I'd go, I'd go to her grocery store, sweep up, clean up the--and get ready for her to open the grocery store; and then I would go back to school.  And then I'd come after school and probably wash vegetables and, you know, she had gro- little grocery store; getting the product--getting the produce out, or bo- put the can goods on the shelf, sweep.  I did all of that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So how long was, was she open?  How long would you stay in the store?
Speaker 2: Oh I'd stay over there 'til dark, then I'd go home.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 653139
Speaker 1: Did you have a favorite subject in school [Douglass School, Lawton, Oklahoma]?
Speaker 2: Not really, probably--but I, but I, probably would be math.  I was not good at English, writing, so probably mathematics.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And other than Mr. Sadberry [John Sadberry], did you have a favorite teacher, or mentor?
Speaker 2: I had a lot of, I had good teachers.  Mrs. Johnson [ph.] taught me mathematics and she was the--I mean Mrs. Patterson [ph.] taught me mathematics, she was the wife--I mean the sister of Mrs. Octavia Johnson who ran the grocery store (laughter)--and Mrs. Johnson taught me a lot about in math.  Then we had Mr. Presley [Levi Presley], Mr. Presley was the band, music teacher and I was essentially the director of the band--student director of the band.  I, I pulled the--when, when I was driving--when I was old enough to drive, I would be the one that would be driving the car with the instruments.  I was a very responsible kid, so I, I was, pulled the trailer with the instruments in it for the band.  And I would direct the band as a student for Mr. Presley so I, and.
Speaker 1: What instrument did you play?
Speaker 2: I played the saxophone.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Saxophones, E-flat alto saxophone or cara- clarinet--those are my instruments; and that's when Mr. Presley, when I get ready to graduate from high school, he suggested that I do something other than music (laughter).  He--and I took that little, that was the advice I got from him.
Speaker 1: So he saw you as a leader, but not necessarily as a musician?
Speaker 2: Not necessarily as a good musician; so I put the saxophone down, and I went to college.  I just, and I just looked up and I was in front of a business school at Oklahoma State University [Stillwater, Oklahoma].
Speaker 1: Now wait a minute, you, we, we're going too fast, now a little bit too fast, let's go back, back up a little bit, but so, so--
Speaker 2: Well those are some of the teachers: Sadberry was the principal; Mrs. Patterson was the math teacher; Mrs. Winn [ph.] was an English teacher; Mr. Presley was the musician, music school.  Those are, those are the teachers that I remember.  Mr. Johnson [ph.], who was my sixth grade teacher was the one that tore my rear end out because I ran out across the street in front of a train.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I--we still get together, he's, he's quite a leader in Nashville [Tennessee].
Speaker 1: Okay, so he's here in Nashville now?
Speaker 2: I mean, I'm sorry in Ok- in Lawton [Oklahoma].
Speaker 1: In Lawton, all right.
Speaker 2: I'm sorry, I (unclear).
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, so when you were on the verge of graduating from high school then, I mean what advice did you get in terms of college, did you--did they encourage you to go to college?
Speaker 2: Some of my teachers did, they thought I should go to college, they thought I was smart enough.  My folks [Nellie Gaines Howard and Houston Howard] never did, I mean they--'cause they didn't have any way of funding my college anyway.  But Mr. Presley encouraged me to go on to college and to take--actually, it was some sort of a business type of a course, he thought I was good at organizing things; and--so I, that's what I did: I decided to go on to college and--
Speaker 1: I mean so how did you--did you apply to several colleges, or just one (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No.  I went to one.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I, I went up--I don't know how I got to Stillwater [Oklahoma].  All I remember, when I got to Stillwater was I was standing in front of the hall for the school of business [Division of Business; Spears School of Business], and I looked up and I said that's--I think I'll go sign up for business.
Speaker 1: So this is--now, now you graduated from high school in '57 [1957]?
Speaker 2: Fifty-six [1956].
Speaker 1: Fifty-six [1956], okay, okay--1956.
Speaker 2: And they would--the schools were just integrating at that time.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: 'Cause they didn't have integration at Stillwater until that--I think that year.
Story_ID: 653140
Speaker 1: By 1956, now this is the year of the Montgomery Bus Boycott; Eisenhower's the president [President Dwight David "Ike" Eisenhower].  Did, did you get a chance to get outside of Lawton [Oklahoma] much?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: I know you visited your grandparents in the summer (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No--we didn't I didn't, I didn't participate in any of those things.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So this is one of the--going to Stillwater's [Oklahoma] like, is a big--?
Speaker 2: It was a big move for me.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I could've gone to, to Langston [Langston University, Langston, Oklahoma], but I didn't.  And I don't know--I really don't know, can't recall who suggested it, but I ended up there; and--
Speaker 1: So were there very many black students at Oklahoma [Oklahoma State University, Stillwater, Oklahoma]?
Speaker 2: Twenty-six.
Speaker 1: Twenty-six.  Okay.
Speaker 2: And I was the only black in the school of business [Division of Business; Spears School of Business], 'cause they told me I was never gonna be able to get a job anyway.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Really?
Speaker 2: Well this is the whites would tell me that, you know, "You're not gonna get a job."  'Cause in that time they weren't hiring blacks in Corporate America.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: There were, there was nothing--there, maybe in the different part of the country.  In Oklahoma, there were no blacks in Corporate America.
Speaker 1: So nobody--your teachers didn't consider that you might start a business?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You had to be hired by white people?
Speaker 2: They had be hired by one, but, and what happened was I think that they thought I was gone end up to be a teacher.  Mr. p- Mr.--the dean of the school of business [Eugene Swearingen] was, was the one that probably encouraged me more than anything else.
Story_ID: 653141
Speaker 1: When I went to school at Oklahoma State, and I signed up for business school [Division of Business; Spears School of Business], I then had to come up with a way to fund it.  And my uncle [Calvin Gaines], which is my wife's--my, my mother's brother took me to work at the Lawton Meat Supply [Lawton Meat Supply Company, Lawton, Oklahoma].  Lawton Meat Supply was KDK Meats [ph.].  Ham--the set--sausage, you know the sausage as well as bologna and wieners.  And Mr. Marlin Keathley gave me a job working every day, and he paid me five dollars a week.
Speaker 2: Now is this the summer before you--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --went?  Okay.
Speaker 1: And I did it every summer when I went to school.  But Mr. Keathley paid me five, one--five dollars.  And then the rest of my money went into the bank account to help me go to school.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So that's how they--I was gonna say five dollars a week is less than you were making in the grocery store, but (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: --but you got paid more but your money went into a--
Speaker 1: To, to an account.  When I got short of money, Mr. Keathley would loan me money from the money.  And then I would come back and in the summer and work and pay it off.  And then just do this every year; and that's how I basically funded my school.  Except the last two or three years, I think I had national--those student--National Defense Loans [National Defense Student Loans; Federal Perkins Loan Program]--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --to go to college.  But, you know, tuition was eighty dollars--
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Okay.
Speaker 1: --a semester.  (Laughter) So it was, it was a little bit different.  And then Mr. Swearingen [Eugene Swearingen] was the principal's name.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: The dean's name.  The dean gave me a--got me a job teaching his lab classes when I was a sophomore.  The statistics classes, I was that good in mathematics at statistics; and so I taught the lab classes for the students at Oklahoma State University [Stillwater, Oklahoma] when I was a, a sophomore.  And that helped me cover the cost of school and the board--room and board.
Speaker 2: This is, no, this is impressive--I mean you, you were a good, math- mathematician.  So you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, that's right; and Swearingen saw this and he has, he pushed me along into that school.
Speaker 2: Statistics are not easy for everybody.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And you're really doing trigonometry--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --when you do statistics.
Speaker 1: So I, I was, I--these people like Swearingen and Levi Presley and Sadberry [John Sadberry]--these were the men that were my motivation.  My father [Houston Howard] was--I remember when I was getting short of cash one time, I think it was my junior year and I was gonna drop out of school, and that's when he stepped up and said, "No I want you to go on and finish, finish college," and that's when he kind of chipped in.  But other than that my family never paid anything to me going to school.  I had to make it all, all--I mean any way I w- if I wanted to go to school, I had to provide for myself.
Story_ID: 653142
Speaker 1: So your education at Douglass high school [Douglass School, Lawton, Oklahoma] was--met the demand at Oklahoma State [Oklahoma State University, Stillwater, Oklahoma]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You didn't have to (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.  I didn't--I don't remember, I didn't take SAT or whatever they do today to get in college.  I didn't have any of that stuff.  I just went to school.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you had a good, solid education--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --from Douglass.  So, all right so, so how, how did you do gradewise at Oklahoma State?
Speaker 2: I made Cs the first year--first semester; (laughter) then I got my act together and went back and joined--and got on the honor roll 'cause I couldn't stand not being on the honor roll.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Focus, and, and then I began to make A's and Bs.
Speaker 1: Were there any African American instructors at Oklahoma State?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) No, I didn't see one.  I think that I--there was one fella in the school of business [Division of Business; Spears School of Business] named Ponder.  Ponder was--used to be president of Fisk [Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee], and I think he was working on his doctorate.  But he didn't--I don't remember him teaching me anything.  He didn't--he was not ever one of my instructors.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Ponder, yeah.  I've heard that name.
Speaker 2: Yeah, [HistoryMaker] Henry Ponder.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: But there were only twenty-six, about twenty-six blacks in the whole ten thousand students.
Speaker 1: Now where did you live?
Speaker 2: In the dormitory.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Was not an issue or anything?
Speaker 2: No, not an issue, we have two blacks.  We had a room, 162 Cordell Hall.  Stayed in the same room for four years.
Speaker 1: Okay, 'cause you realize there was the issue on a lot of campuses in the country, including places like Purdue [Purdue University, West Lafayette, Indiana] and places up north where, you know, black students could not stay on campus--Ohio State [The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I never had a problem.
Speaker 1: (Unclear).
Speaker 2: Football players were in Bennett Hall.  There were a few blacks in the football team and basketball, track and they had--their dormitory was in Bennett Hall.  I was in Cordell Hall.  And Mr. Rogers [ph.] who was the headmaster there got me a little job answering the telephone after midnight.  So I got paid a little bit extra cash for that, and helped me there a little bit.
Speaker 1: Yeah now I see the pattern here.  You have a lot of little jobs (unclear).
Speaker 2: Well you have to put a lot of little money--you can't, (unclear) if you don't have a lot you take whatever you can get.  But Mr. John--Mr. Rogers gave me the job and so when my--sometimes I would not go home 'cause I don't have a job, so I just stayed there and monitored the dorm while the students went home; protect the dorm and, and stayed there at the dormitory.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So how were the black students treated on campus for the most part?  Fair- fairly well?
Speaker 2: They don't--I don't think we were loved on the campus, but there was no rioting on the campus as far as I was concerned.  I mean--I attended--I did very well in terms of, of providing leadership to the campus.  I'm known at Oklahoma State as being one of those hard working person, who got along with a lot of people; and I was in leadership roles when I was in my junior, senior and my graduate years.
Story_ID: 653143
Speaker 1: What was it like in southwest Oklahoma in those days in terms of race relations?  Do--were there like signs of black and white and that sort of thing or?  Or had it (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, there were probably a few signs like that in bathrooms and restrooms and that kind of thing.  But you see, that was just a way of life at that time.
Speaker 1: Okay  I just wondered what Oklahoma--you know, Oklahoma, some people consider it a western state; some people consider it a southern state, you know.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Like Texas, where you, you kind of, has a--so I don't know, that's why I'm--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I, I, you know, it was a hard--I don't know what I would describe it either 'cause I, I mean I--.  The way I look at it is: white people didn't like black people, and that's the way it went.  Then I just (unclear) focus on--my, my job was to get an education, get a degree and come on out.
Speaker 1: Now did--was there much interaction growing up or in college with the Native American population, Indians?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We--I don't know of any on the campus--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --at all.  I mean the, the ar- the Indian reservation was right- already, right outside of Lawton [Oklahoma], but nobody--I never went out there.  I never been to it even today.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So there was pretty much no relationship?
Speaker 2: Unh-uh.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 653144
Speaker 1: In terms of your business courses, what, what did you gravitate towards in business?  What, what (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Economics.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was studying economics and, and I liked economics because it--conceptually it helps you focus on the structure of things; how things really work in a free enterprise system.  And, and that's what--I, I went and got a master's degree in economics from Stanford [Stanford University, Stanford, California] as a result of--I got, I got a business degree in business administration; and then did one year graduate school at Oklahoma State [Oklahoma State University, Stillwater, Oklahoma].  And that was just to prepare myself to go to Stan- to Stanford and then I was working on my Ph.D. at Stanford; and then I decided to quit.
Speaker 1: Now I wanna go back a little bit further here.  Now, when you were--let's see--well this is 1960 when you graduate from Oklahoma?
Speaker 2: Sixty-one [1961] when I graduated.
Speaker 1: Sixty-one [1961]?  Okay.  All right so '61 [1961].  So this is--now John Kennedy's president [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy] by now.  And, now were you, were you--'cause you were saying before you didn't you, you all didn't listen to--you didn't turn on the TV set.
Speaker 2: I didn't.
Speaker 1: Or didn't have, you know (unclear)?
Speaker 2: I was not active politically.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.
Speaker 2: In, in anything.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Anything; I was not active in the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], I was not active--I was active in the church, but other than that I was not active in anything.
Speaker 1: Now, did, did you have any church activities in Stillwater [Oklahoma]?
Speaker 2: Yes I we- there's a church--we went to a Baptist church, can't remember the name of it but, but I walked to church, you know.  It was a black church, but I didn't--there was nothing on the campus I went to.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now did you play any leadership role on campus at Oklahoma State?
Speaker 2: Yes, I was considered to be a leader.  I mean I ended up in Blue Key [Blue Key Honor Society]; I ended up in fraternity--Alpha fraternity was formed during that period of time on the campus, so I became a (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) A Phi A?
Speaker 2: --A Phi A.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Alpha Phi Alpha, so I became a member of Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity.  I was a leader in the school of business [Division of Business; Spears School of Business].  I was on the business student council, the only black in school so I guess they had to have diversity.  (Laughter) So I was on the student council.  I--during the school year I--in order to go to school I had a little group called the Blazers [ph.].  We used to sing at fraternity parties and sorority events; and, and if there was a talent show on the campus I participated in the talent show with the singing.  I was pretty good in those days--can't sing a note today.
Speaker 1: Well what kind of songs was--what was the repertoire (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh we, we--our repertoire was more like the--do you remember The Platters?  It was, it was four boys and a girl--that's the same thing we were doing.  And so we sang all those songs.
Speaker 1: Platters are the, (singing) "You've got the magic touch," ['(You've Got) The Magic Touch'] (unclear).
Speaker 2: That's right (laughter).  Yeah.  But it was, it was, it was good, you know, I, I grew up pretty well.  I mean I did, I did pretty well, in terms of developing my leadership skills, as well as--but I was still quiet.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I, I never did--I was never that kind of a leader.

Speaker 1: Now you're having a successful college experience.
Speaker 2: I had a very good college experience.  I mean I have--I consider myself blessed in terms of my background--what I am today came from Oklahoma State [Oklahoma State University, Stillwater, Oklahoma], I mean it came from Oklahoma State, that's where I got my underpinnings in business, in leadership, you know, learn how to carry emotion through in a meeting (laughter), you know; and, and standing up and articulating a view and, and getting followers with you.  I mean--and when I go to Oklahoma State, I don't go there often, but the- my reputation is there.  They everybody knows--even the students today know, heard- they've heard of Sam Howard [HistoryMaker Samuel Howard] on that campus.  I'm in the--I've been inducted into the hall of fame, both the college of business [Division of Business; Spears School of Business] hall of fame as well as the school's hall of fame; so, but Oklahoma State is very important to me.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, now did, did your college success influence your brothers and sisters back home?
Speaker 2: No.  Lula [Lula Howard] didn't finish college.  She finished--she got married.  She didn't finish college.  My sister Callie [Callie Howard] never finished--never went to college.  She married a [U.S.] military person, and then had children.  My brother [Maurice Howard], he started in college but he never finished.  He went to Lang- I think he went to Langston [Langston University, Langston, Oklahoma], but he never finished.  They--I--they looked up to me, but it didn't influence them in, in a way.  They just--they knew one--they did work.  They all looked for jobs my, my brother's more like my father [Houston Howard].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Quiet.  Doesn't--he's just quiet, and he works hard.  He works holidays (laughter) 'cause he gets more, double pay on holidays so he does that, and he stays at home.
Speaker 1: Now it just seems when you, you, you--as you, as you were leaving and after you left like a whole world opens up for you, you know, it's just completely different.
Speaker 2: It was different.  Mother [Nellie Gaines Howard] couldn't understand why I wanted to continue to go to school and get a master's degree.  She said it's time for you to get out and go to work.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Okay.  Did she have an idea of what kind of job you would have--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --after getting a--?
Speaker 2: We never talked about my, my schooling at home.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.
Speaker 2: We never did.  My father just wanted me to finish that degree, though.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He wanted me to get through it.  But I never got coaching from--advice on them from college or career.  All of my advice came from, probably four men.  Marlin Keathley because he helped me fund the education, and he would take interest in me when I'd come back to go to work at the meat supply, meat company [Lawton Meat Supply Company, Lawton, Oklahoma].  Levi [Levi Presley]--Mr. Swearingen, Dean Swearingen [Eugene Swearingen], he was coaching me at school, making sure I took the right courses and I think he was thinking I was gonna be a teacher as opposed to a businessman--I mean that's what he probably thought, I was gonna teach economics.  And then when I got out of college, then there was two other men: Mr. Jack Anderson, who became my really mentor in business here in Nashville [Tennessee] when I went to work for a white company, for sure; and then Tommy Frist [Thomas F. Frist, Jr.] also in Nashville.
Story_ID: 653146
Speaker 1: Let me ask you about how--I mean the getting into Stanford [Stanford University, Stanford, California].  Now this is, this is a big step; and, it was the dean--
Speaker 2: Swearingen [Eugene Swearingen].
Speaker 1: --Swearingen that?
Speaker 2: He was, he was a Stanford graduate.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And he got me a scholarship at Stanford--Eichler, E-I-C-H-L-E-R.  It was a Eichler scholarship, three thousand dollars.  And he help me get that scholarship to work on my Ph.D.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So it was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) In econom- in economics.
Speaker 1: --okay.  So it was to not just get a master's but you're going to get a Ph.D.
Speaker 2: I was gonna get a Ph.D.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And I went out there and I took all the tests for the ma- took all the finals for the master's degree and decided that I was not gonna continue to go to school with--to get the Ph.D.  I got a job from General Electric company [GE].  The first black to get hired in the, what's called the Financial Management Program of General Electric.
Speaker 1: Well, let, let me ask you about school and--before we--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --get your job.  But, but like what, what did you focus on at Stan- at--
Speaker 2: Stanford.
Speaker 1: --Stanford.
Speaker 2: I focused on economics, period.  That's all I did.   I lived in, I--when I first went to Stanford--I lived in Berkeley [California]; and drove down to Stanford every day to school and went back to Berkeley.  And the only thing I did was, other than go to school, was go to church.
Story_ID: 653147
Speaker 1: You mentioned just before the break that you got married at a--
Speaker 2: I got married in '62 [1962].
Speaker 1: Sixty-two [1962].  Okay.  All right (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Sixty-two [1962], sixty-th- or '62 [1962], I think that's right.
Speaker 1: So that's, that's before you go to Stanford [Stanford University, Stanford, California], or?
Speaker 2: I got married--no I was in--I was--I got married in December of the year I started at Stanford.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We got engaged before I left.  I--we got married December the 29th in '62 [1962].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well tell us how you met your wife, if there's a story there?
Speaker 2: There is a story there.
Speaker 1: You, you know that story?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I know that one well.  During the summer--after I finished school, '61 [1961], I went to work in Washington, D.C.  Remember the uncle that got me the job at--Calvin [Calvin Gaines], Calvin got me the job at ber- at the meat packing company [Lawton Meat Supply Company, Lawton, Oklahoma]?  He was now in Washington and I got a job at the commerce department [U.S. Department of Commerce].  This is a job that's not on my resume because I was only there for the summer; and I met--during my tenure there in--I lived with my uncle on Park Avenue [sic. Park Road] and I met a gentleman--my uncle had a barber shop, and I met a guy named Marvin Wilson [ph.].  Marvin Wilson was a medical student at Howard [Howard University College of Medicine, Washington, D.C.] at the time.  And Marvin was getting ready to come back to school--I mean getting ready to go home from the summer, and I needed to get home to go by--go to my house, and--go to my house and then go on to Stillwater [Oklahoma State University, Stillwater, Oklahoma] and go to--finish--start my master's degree.  Well, Marvin says, "Why don't you just ride with me, you know, you can get, get a bus," 'cause I didn't have a car.  "Get a bus and you can take the bus from my house," which is Ottawa, Kansas, "and go to down to Lawton [Oklahoma] and up to Stillwater."   Well, I got--took the trip with Marvin, I think the car--we probably burned more oil than gas (laughter).  But we made it (laughter).  And I met his sister; and that's where I met Karan [Karan Howard].  And I never got home, I stayed the, I stayed at his house for a week; we got engaged basically during that period of time.  And then I went from there, caught the bus, and went back--instead of going to Lawton, I went straight to Stillwater.
Speaker 1: Now wait a minute now, you, you met her at--you were--
Speaker 2: And we fell in love.
Speaker 1: --a week?
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: That's all it took was a week.
Speaker 2: That's all it took was a week.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you (unclear) drive home.
Speaker 2: And then, then, then--I knew it was right away and when I went on--I went to Stillwater, started--I was talking to her on the phone a lot; and then Christmas I gave her the ring.  And then we were not gonna get married until she finished her degree at--in Emporia State [Kansas State Teachers College; Emporia State University, Emporia, Kansas].  When she finished her degree in Emporia State, we got married the 29th of '62 [1962].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  So did she (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And then she went to California with me.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: And you know what, I didn't own a car or anything during that period of time.  I borrowed a car to--drove from--t- I borrowed a car to drive from Berkeley, California to Ottawa to get married and pick up all of her stuff and drove it back.  It was a Volkswagen (laughter); and the guy, I didn't know him, I just--I got one of my, my jobs, you know, you--during that time the post office [U.S. Post Office Department; U.S. Postal Service] was--needed extra help during Christmastime, so I needed to make some money to go home, so I worked at the post office.  And that's when I met this gentleman who said, "You could take my car."  And I took it, drove it all the way down there, and came back.
Speaker 1: That's quite a story.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Quite a story that somebody would let you do that and--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --yeah.
Speaker 2: That's right.  I don't even remember his name today.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, so.
Speaker 2: But I, but I did--it was a Volkswagen, brand new Volkswagen.
Story_ID: 653148
Speaker 1: After you took the test for the master's [degree] part, you were supposed to keep--continue on for your (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Ph.D.--I was--but then General Electric [GE] had been courting me to come to work for them; and I decided to quit, go to work for General.
Speaker 1: So this is 1963.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Nineteen sixty-three [1963].  Now this is a hell of a year though, the country is going through all kind of changes in '63 [1963].  Civil Rights Movement in boiling.  Medgar Evers gets shot.  March on Washington.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: The church [16th Street Baptist Church] in Birmingham [Alabama] is bombed.  JFK [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy] gets killed that fall; you know, it was like a heck of a year so?
Speaker 2: But I was involved with Stanford [Stanford University, Stanford, California].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I was not involved in--we didn't--we did have a little bit of civil rights challenges in, in, in Mountain View, California and, and Stanford [California].  When I took my wife [Karan Howard] out there we couldn't get an apartment.  We ended up having to use the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] to help us overcome racial discrimination in terms of rental apartments; and that's, that's--we did do that.  But, but I'm a probably more of a low key person when it comes to civil rights stuff and, you know, I have my way to win battles and win relationships, so I, so, I never marched or anything like that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 653149
Speaker 1: Now you went to work with General Electric as a financial analyst.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Okay, and--
Speaker 2: But I was in that--what, the best thing that GE offered was the Financial Management Program--BTC, business training course.  All executives who were in finance had to go through that course, that means I was really picked; I mean, that's where I really learned accounting and everything else.  And I learned computers.  I learned how to program a computer and I, I used to do that at General Electric company.  And so I--you rotate through the job, through various jobs and one of my jobs I rotated was through the Financial Management Program--I mean the computer program (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Computer program.  So, what, what were you--now this is the time when computers are the big mainframes?
Speaker 2: It's big main frames, the Philco 2000 [Transac S-2000] (laughter).
Speaker 1: Philco, that's (unclear)--yeah, we had a big Philco refrigerator--
Speaker 2: That's--(laughter).
Speaker 1: --and a TV.  So they had a Philco 2000 computer?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Now how, how large was it?  Just for the sake of--?
Speaker 2: I mean it's, god--this, this room here would not hold it, (laughter) it would be this whole office suite (laughter).  It was big; and you, you deal, deal with these cards, you had, you know, these 80 column cards that you wrote your--all your program into, the FORTRAN language [Formula Translation] and this thing; and you, you drop those cards, they get out of order, you're up a creek (laughter).  Oh, those, those were the days, you dropped a card, you're a mess.  But I, I, I did learn a lot about computers.  I learned conceptually what computers do.  They're all really is one and zero, one and zero, one and zero--that's all it is: one, zero; and I, and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) (Unclear) I was going to say, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  So conceptually I picked that up and so that I began to learn how to program FORTRAN; and, and I worked on--GE really taught me a lot of stuff in terms of finance, that's what I, that's what I learned from them.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you learned FORTRAN and this is--so this is training--GE is providing you training that Stanford [Stanford University, Stanford, California] (unclear) provide.  Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's right, that's right.  GE was probably looking forward to me becoming an auditor and going up the financial room, and I was on track to be a officer in GE if I had just kept working.  But they--what happened with GE was there was another opportunity that came up; and they, they suggested that I take that route, and that was the White House Fellows program.
Story_ID: 653150
Speaker 1: Now this is interesting, now did you ha- was there a special person at GE [General Electric] that (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Mr. Johnson [ph.].
Speaker 1: Mr. Johnson.  Okay, now this is--
Speaker 2: All these Johnsons coming up.
Speaker 1: You're right.
Speaker 2: Mr. Johnson was the chief financial officer of nuclear electronic product section of GE; and he saw my activities in the community, working in the church, and suggested that I might want to file, and fill out an application and become a White House Fellow.  This new program that Mr. Johnson--that President Johnson [President Lyndon Baines Johnson] had in Washington, D.C.
Speaker 1: So this is--now I don't know why I hadn't thought about this before but the White House Fellowship program was something that President Johnson started?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  President Johnson started it, and John Gardner [John W. Gardner] was the, the instigator of it.  John Garner was the secretary of HHS [U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare; U.S. Department of Health and Human Services].
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: But he was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And later Common Cause.
Speaker 2: Later Common Cause, but he was--
Speaker 1: (Unclear) way back in the (unclear), yeah.
Speaker 2: That's right, that's right.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: But he was the one that really came up with this idea of bringing young people to work for cabinet offices for one year.  And that's what it was, in '65 [sic. 1964] they started.
Speaker 1: That is something--I didn't know it and I (unclear) you know, 'cause I knew about--I was excited when I saw John Gardner on your outline--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --'cause I spent a day with him.
Speaker 2: Oh he was a brilliant man.  I worked for him--when I left the White House Fellows program, I did work one year as a consultant on the Cuban refugee situation, Cuban refugees out of Florida.  But I was working--I was, I was fully employed at Howard University [Washington, D.C.], 'cause you know Howard University is under the budget of HHS.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: So okay so, so White House Fellowship pro- program.  Now--well let me ask you this at GE before we leave GE because these are the days when people end up being the first black at one place or another.
Speaker 2: I'm black every- first black everywhere (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Were there other black employees at GE when you--I mean in, in the business?
Speaker 2: No (unclear).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I was the only black in the training program.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: In the whole country.  The question is whether they'll--whether I was gonna be based in San Jose, California, which is where--or go to--connected in New York [New York].  And I, I chose San Jose, California.
Speaker 1: Okay.  This is something so, so White House Fellowship program, this is 1966 (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Six [1966].
Speaker 1: Right.  This is--?
Speaker 2: Sixty-five [1965]--'66 [1966] I became a fellow, so '65 [1965] I was applying.
Story_ID: 653151
Speaker 1: See the way GE [General Electric] did this--let me, let me see if I can explain this.  The White House Fellows were selected by a commission.  (Pause) But during my term, GE decided to have internal, internal competition for the White House Fellows program.  And I and another gentleman from I think he's from the East became GE's nominees to the White House Fellows program.  First program--first year was probably more of lawyers, this type.  This--my term as 1966 were more corporate.  We had four IBM [International Business Machines Corporation] executives; two--I was a GE executive.  All of us were more--and then they had some--most were lawyers.  But I wanted, I wanted to--I had to make that distinction because I was nominated by them, and when I went to get my nomi- when I filled out the application for the national, I was, was interviewed in San Francisco [California]; then I was interviewed in Washington, D.C.  And met John Gardner [John W. Gardner] at the night of the, the hearing--I mean the night of my interview, and I remember walking out after that last night I just didn't know whether I was gonna make it or not.  And I went, and I was right outside of the civil service building [U.S. Civil Service Commission Building] in Washington, D.C.  And you go in and you get your letter.  And you have been selected as a White House Fellow, go to the White House [Washington, D.C.]; or you have not been selected.  And mine was a very simple letter: you have been selected.  And that's when I called my wife [Karan Howard] and--to tell her that--she was in California naturally.  I had my first flight on an airplane was from there, from Los Angeles [California] to Washington--I mean from San Jose--San Francisco to Washington, D.C.
Speaker 2: Long flight (laughter).
Speaker 1: Long flight and--but anyway.
Story_ID: 653152
Speaker 1: But those days I think our salary [as a White House Fellow] was fif- thirteen thousand dollars a year.
Speaker 2: So that was--that's good money in those days--I mean 1966, my brother graduated in accounting from Central State [Central State University, Wilberforce, Ohio], got a job at General Motors [General Motors Corporation; General Motors Company], he was making eight thousand dollars a year--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --and it was considered a good--he bought a house--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --color TV.
Speaker 1: We were--we, we were in New York, and we lived in Riverdale, New York [Riverdale, Bronx, New York], and my wife [Karan Howard] said she couldn't live downtown in New York City [New York, New York] 'cause it was no trees (laughter) so, so we moved in this apartment and, and she made it work.  I mean she made--my wife is the best manager of money when things are tight than anybody I know.
Speaker 2: Now that's something coming from a, a businessman.
Speaker 1: Yeah but I, I never--we--I never worry--as, as an entrepreneur, I never worried about things getting tight and what I'm gonna do.  She could make it go, she could cook--more ways to cook hamburger meat and--(laughter) than anybody I know.  And she was, she was very frugal.  She's not gonna go off and break the bank.  No, you just tell her things are tight and she'll tighten that thing down as tight as she can get it.
Story_ID: 653153
Speaker 1: Tell us now, what--your experiences as a w- White House Fellow, what happens when you--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --well, what--what's the first thing that ha- that, that happens when you make the flight from--?
Speaker 2: Okay once you become a White House Fellow, you then go back, pack and move to New Yor- move to Washington, D.C or in New York in my case.  We go through two weeks of training.  That is, meeting people and understanding how to government works; and this is an education so that we will know what a bureaucracy is.  Trying to learn who the most important person is--that's where I learned the most important person is the bureaucrat.  The head of the bureau is the one that stays there after Democrats and Republicans leave (laughter) he's the only one, he'll take--he will take the cover off of the last proposal; change the, change the first paragraph or two to reflect whatever the party's nomination is and send it right back up to you (laughter).  I learned that.  It's, it's, oh, it was the biggest joke I ever had when I was in the Brookings Institution [Washington, D.C.].  I said so this is what this stuff--no wonder things don't change 'round here.  But the financial bureaucrat was the--a bureaucrat was the most powerful thing--that's what I always learned.  So when I go to Washington, when I was lobbying for the companies in subsequent years, all I wanted to do is watch how the paper flows.  Then I knew who--where I need to go; and that's the one I would endear myself through it.  Politicians I didn't need to meet them.  I, I knew how the thing worked.
Speaker 1: So, so politicians are being blamed for--needlessly (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) (Laughter) That's right.  Civil service is where, that's, that's where power is, that's where it is: the bureaucrat, who is head of the bureau.
Speaker 1: That's disturbing--
Speaker 2: I mean, it's--
Speaker 1: --but it makes sense.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: Anyway--
Speaker 1: --two weeks of training.
Speaker 2: --two weeks of training.  And then I was sent to my assignment in, in New York and that was a, that was another year of education.  Understanding Washington--I mean United Nations [UN], Washington, D.C. and, and cabinet offices and what--
Speaker 1: So what did they call that part of the training (unclear)?
Speaker 2: That was my one year as a White House Fellow.  I was a White House Fellow.
Speaker 1: All right.  And you were assigned to a--?
Speaker 2: Ambassador Arthur Goldberg--I selected him.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Why, why did you select him?
Speaker 2: Because I wanted to do something other than HHS [U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare; U.S. Department of Health and Human Services].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They'd have put me in HHS and social services, and I wanted to broaden my perspective.  And I said I need to go; and I--my best move was to go under Arthur Goldberg.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I used to get up in the morning--we lived in Riverdale [Bronx, New York], drive down to the United Nations [United Nations Headquarters, New York, New York] and park my car in the United ga- Nations garage, get up out of the car, go across the street to the U.S. Mission [U.S. Mission to the United Nations, New York, New York], U.S. Mission, read the telegrams and be ready to brief Arthur Goldberg when he came in at nine [o'clock].  Had to read all those telegrams from the night before.  And then when I'd--then I would do my work for him, go across the street, participate with ambassadors in the sessions, pick up intelligence whatever I can and go back and report 'em to the U.S. Mission and, or whatever else they wanted me to do.  When--sometimes in the afternoon I would get on a plane, on the u- on, on the Eastern shuttle and fly from Washing- to New York to Washington.  That was where the training program continued for the White House Fellows program.  These are afterhours meetings with cabinet officers et cetera.  Then I'd get on a plane at eleven o'clock and fly back to New York; and pick up my car and drive to Riverdale.
Speaker 1: Okay, arriving at?
Speaker 2: By midnight or so; and then go to bed, get up the next morning, leave and be downtown at seven o'clock.  Made sixty-six trips to Washington during that period of time.
Story_ID: 653154
Speaker 1: What were some of the issues in the--that the UN ambassador was dealing with in 1966?
Speaker 2: Six-Day War.  Remember the--the war?
Speaker 1: Nineteen sixty-seven [1967], the Six-Day War (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's--Six-Day War, that's right.  And the year that--
Speaker 1: --the alliance of Arab countries attacked Israel.
Speaker 2: That's right, Six-Day War was--Israel fought that war and won it.  And Goldberg [Arthur Goldberg] tried to get them to--well I guess he, he got engaged in ending it, ending the conflict.  The other thing (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah this was a really dramatic. I was--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --I remember Jewish students at the high school that I was at, you know, getting ready to quit high school to go fight.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's right.  Those were--
Speaker 1: It was, it was--people didn't know the outcome of this, they didn't know it was only going to last six days.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: They, they thought that--
Speaker 2: But it lasted only a week.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  They thought that Israel would be this--had--there was a possibility--
Speaker 2: -bility of being destroyed.
Speaker 1: That's right.  That's right.
Speaker 2: But then we had the--lot of things in South Africa, southwest Afri- South Africa, apartheid was going on during that period of time; and, and the Vietnam War was going on.
Speaker 1: Yeah it was starting to escalate.
Speaker 2: Escalate, and 'cause Johnson [President Lyndon Baines Johnson] was in as the president, and then there, that was a lot of activity there.  And I think that Goldberg probably thought that he could end the Vietnam War if we could get it handled up at the United Nations.  But Rusk [Dean Rusk] and McNamara [Robert McNamara] were not going to allot that situation leave Washington, D.C. so that just didn't work.  And--but then those were the issues that came up during the mer- period of time.  I only made one trip to Peru.  The death of--it was a diplomatic trip with Admiral McCain [John S. McCain, Jr.], he's John McCain daddy, was head of the fleet, the Atlantic fleet and he was the representative for the U.S. government.  And I went on a trip with him to that--to the funeral in Peru--Lima, Peru; and that's the only--that was the only foreign I had as a, as a White House Fellow.  The rest of 'em were between Nashville [Tennessee]--I mean between New York and Washington, D.C. as a White House Fellow.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was not as close to my fellows because--I didn't socialize with them 'cause I mean I'm in, I'm in an airplane.  There are two or three fellows I got to be very close with because sometimes instead of going home I'd go stay one of the- one of their hou- homes and that's what I did.
Speaker 1: There were--I saw photos, it'd be at least like forty, is that?
Speaker 2: Eighteen fellows.
Speaker 1: Eighteen?  Okay (unclear) I magnified it (laughter).  Eighteen fellows then (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's all right, eighteen fellows.  That was, that was during my class.  I think it's one of the largest classes they had at the time.
Speaker 1: So, at any given time would, would one class finish (background noise) before another class started--was that, was that how it worked?  So your eighteen would be the White House Fellows for a period of time, and then (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, you're, you're, you're one year as a White House Fellow.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then you, then you go back to, go back to your job.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was to go back to General Electric company [GE], or wherever I could--wanted to go and--but it was a one year assignment.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It generally started in July, and ended in, in June of the next year.

Speaker 1: Yeah, I just wanted to ask you about Lyndon Johnson [President Lyndon Baines Johnson].  He's one of the--he's a figure that a lot of black people feel they owe for the civil rights bill--act of 1964 [Civil Rights Act of 1964].  I mean he did a lot of things for poor people when he was president.  But he also prosecuted the Vietnam War, which was--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --like a--kind--that seems like a major contradiction to his legacy.  And you were saying that you--you know?
Speaker 2: Well Vietnam War was--its activity was handled in, in Washington, D.C.  I told you that I thought that Goldberg [Arthur Goldberg], you know, he was on the [U.S.] Supreme Court.  He stepped down from the Supreme Court to go to work in Washington.  Some people said he stepped down because Johnson wanted to look up at him as a potential vice presidential candidate, and some people say he stepped down so he can perhaps solve the Vietnam War--that was a personal thing of his.  But the war was handled by McNamara [Robert McNamara] in defense, Rusk in--
Speaker 1: Yeah, Dean Rusk.
Speaker 2: --secretary of state; and the two make--Bundy brothers.
Speaker 1: McGeorge [McGeorge Bundy] and William [William Bundy] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) McGeorge and--one was in, in the Ford Foundation [New York, New York] and the other was a White House, was a White House aide.  And that, that's where the policies were made.  And Johnson just, you know, he just wanted to win.  And it just--it consumed him; and that's, that's what happened to him, that's what happened to his presidency.  It just consumed him.  I don't, I don't know--because I didn't know Johnson personally, I was in New York [New York] most of the time so I didn't have that chance to interact with him as some of my other White House Fellows--I think there were two or three White House Fellows assigned to Washington--to the White House.  And that was--but (unclear), but I did get to see him about three or four times during my tenure.  My wife [Karan Howard] and I would go down there for state dinners.  And then go down--we, we got to know him, Ford [President Gerald Rudolph Ford, Jr.], all of the presidential candidates--presidents for about two or three--two or three terms after that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 653156
Speaker 1: Did you ever meet any of the civil rights Big Six--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --in those days?  Okay.
Speaker 2: No.  As I said I've never involved--I've never been involved in the Civil Rights Movement whatsoever.
Speaker 1: Yeah well sometimes they, you know, they interact, they interacted with the UN and, you know, Whitney Young, Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] or somebody.
Speaker 2: No.  I knew him and I me- and I probably was more endeared to Whitney Young than I was probably to anybody.
Speaker 1: Okay.  The Ur- Urban League [National Urban League]--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --you know has a strong association with business--
Speaker 2: Yes, that's right.  And I'm, and I'm active in that now.  I've been active in it for just about ten years now.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right so--now when your year- when you look back on your year, is there, is there one, you know, what's--what, what stands out to you as your--in--and--what, what did you learn, you know, after your year as a White House Fellow?
Speaker 2: Well, two things I think came through with--from working with Arthur Goldberg.  One is when you're in business, or working negotiations, always do the first draft.  If you write the first draft then basically you control the agenda, and you'll get about 80 per- to 90 percent of what you want--that's one.  And number two I learned: don't get concerned when people say--talk about you because they're talking to their constituents.  A lot of times people make speeches on the floor of the United Nations, or on Security Council [United Nations Security Council], then they'll be ranting about the United States this, United States that--you got to understand they're playing to their constituents back home, for the newspaper coverage.  Watch how they vote, the vote is the most important thing.  So I learned that.  And I used those things the rest of my life, I never get concerned of what people say about you or, or anything like that; nor--and I always do the first draft.  Means more work but I always do the first draft.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I--that's been a--two important things that I have used for forty years.
Story_ID: 653157
Speaker 1: You go back to GE in '67 [1967] I guess, right?
Speaker 2: Well I didn't go back to GE because GE didn't offer me enough money.  What happened was, people at Howard University [Washington, D.C.] offered me a job as director of computer services.  This is in education of computers systems.  Now here I am now in the--and I--what I'm to do?  I had a little bit of computer experience at GE and I thought I was probably the expert so (laughter), so I became a White House Fellow--I mean a, a member of the dir- Howard University management team as director of educational computer services.  In addition, I was also a consultant to John Gardner [John W. Gardner] at HHS [U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare; U.S. Department of Health and Human Services].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.
Speaker 2: That was my, that was my job.  My shortest tenure of employment at all was at Howard University, I think was there for about--I wasn't even there a year, I think it was six or seven months.
Speaker 1: Now why is that?  What happened?
Speaker 2: Well I--at that time I felt that we should move Howard University--set up an educational computer system on the campus, and hook all the schools in Washington, D.C. to Howard University's computer.  And I was gonna go to General Electric--had all these--they had computers and I was gonna get a 40 percent discount on a--computer system from GE, hook 'em all up with a grant; and be- we'll become the hub for teaching education computer ser- computer services for Washington.  And the people thought I was moving too fast.
Speaker 1: So the idea was too big for them I guess (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's right.  So I said fine, I quit.  (Pause) And I moved back to Washington--to New York [New York]; and started a business in Africa [TAW International Leasing, Inc.] with Tom Wood [Thomas A. Wood].
Story_ID: 653158
Speaker 1: What business was this; and what, and who, and who's Tom Wood?
Speaker 2: Tom Wood is the gentleman that I would call the Jackie Robinson of Corporate America.  He's the first African American to take a company public in the computer business.  And I, I met him in California; and he's a true entrepreneur, true entrepreneur.
Speaker 1: Well tell us a little bit--tell us the story of Tom Woods.  Now if he's the Jackie Robinson of business, we need to know--
Speaker 2: Well he started his own computer company [Decision Systems, Inc.].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He took it public.  And in those days you could take a company public, take a company public, but because he was black and they found out about his black--his stock plummeted.
Speaker 1: Yeah I--we've heard the stories of Parker House Sausages [Parker House Sausage Company, Chicago, Illinois] hid the fact that they were black.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: They had white commercials, and (unclear).
Speaker 2: He didn't hide it, he just--Tommy was just light.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But the point is that word rumored--in order to sell stock in the, in, in, in that--during those days, investment bankers sold the stock for the company when they took it public.  Today you got road shows, which means you, you have to go out and stand before the potential buyers of your stock and explain your system, what you wanted to do, but in those days the investment banker was the important--well he did all--he did that and--
Speaker 1: So where, where was Tom Wood from, and?
Speaker 2: He was in New Jersey.
Speaker 1: Okay he's from New--
Speaker 2: Teaneck, New Jersey.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's where I knew him from.
Speaker 1: And where did he go to school?
Speaker 2: Now that I don't know.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: I don't know, but, but Tom then became the--he took--come to public.  He became a director of Chase Manhattan Bank [JPMorgan Chase and Co.] and a good friend of Nelson Rockefeller--not Nelson, but the Rockefeller [David Rockefeller] who was the president of the bank.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He--that Rockefeller and--but, and I went to work with him.
Speaker 1: All right, and his idea was to computerize a?
Speaker 2: No.  His idea was to lease equipment in Africa.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They have a financing company, and we're gonna buy equipment over here in the United States, take it over there and lease it.  And have AID [United States Agency for International Development, USAID] guarantees for our payments (laughter); and we did.  We had an office in Abidjan [Cote d'Ivoire].  We had an office in Kenya and--in Nairobi.  And we--I was with him for four years.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Used to go to Africa every four or five months.  But--
Speaker 1: Any
Speaker 2: --I, I was the treasurer.  I became his chief financial officer of that company and negotiated all those guarantees with AID and, and helped him raise the funds from Prudential [Prudential Insurance Company of America; Prudential Financial, Inc.] and (unclear) one individual.  But he was the leader.  I, basically I was, I was learning.
Speaker 1: And what was the name of the, the company?
Speaker 2: TAW International Leasing [TAW International Leasing, Inc.]--TAW, Thomas A. Wood (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh okay.  Yeah, we have it here, I just.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Thomas A. Wood.
Speaker 1: So are there any stories from those days?
Speaker 2: Oh you know.
Speaker 1: Africa was emerging countries (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It was emerging but we, you know, this is a whole new concept of providing capital equipment in Africa via leases--I mean that was a whole new concept and that's what Tommy wanted to do; and we did it for a while until I got a little bit bored I guess after a while and tried to get him to switch over to radio stations.  Since he didn't wanna switch, I switched (laughter).  I left him and went to work for--formed my own radio company, Phoenix Communications company [Phoenix Communications Group, Inc.].
Speaker 1: Okay, so you were with him from 1968 to 1972?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: All right.
Story_ID: 653159
Speaker 1: How did you become interested in radio?
Speaker 2: Well I--at that time I began to look for other entrepreneurial, (pronunciation) entrepreneurial opportunities and I happened to get hold of some investor's reports on radio stations and really found out that perhaps this was a way to go.  Why?  I couldn't find where, in my research where anyone who owned a radio station had ever lost any money--lost value, I should say, lost value.  So I said well maybe I should buy radio stations.  And at about that time Benjamin Hooks [HistoryMaker Reverend Benjamin Hooks]--now was that Benjamin Hooks?  In Memphis [Tennessee] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah he comes around '73 [1973]?
Speaker 2: And he passed a provision that said if you sell stations to an African American you get a deferral in your capital gains taxes.
Speaker 1: Right.  FCC [Federal Communications Commission] (unclear) regulation, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's right, that's how that--done deal (laughter).  So I started focusing on radio stations.
Speaker 1: Okay, so it was an attempt to stimulate minority ownership--
Speaker 2: Minority ownership.  That right.
Speaker 1: --by giving whites an incentive to (unclear).
Speaker 2: Sell to blacks.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Right, okay.
Speaker 2: But--and then--but I wanted Tom [Thomas A. Wood] to do it, you know, as a diversification effort for TAW [TAW International Leasing, Inc.], but he didn't; so I went it on my own.
Speaker 1: Too big an opportunity to leave for?
Speaker 2: In my opinion, yeah; and I was really intending to just buy a radio stations and do nothing.  But, anyway the first group I didn't buy--well I couldn't finish their money.  I couldn't raise the money from Salomon Brothers and Morgan Stanley [Morgan Stanley Wealth Management].  Then I--once I couldn't raise the first round I, you know, I didn't have enough money to live.  I was not wealthy and I had a family, so I took a job.  I left there and went to Meharry Medical College [Nashville, Tennessee]--
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: --in 1973; and then in 1974 is when I bought the first radio station in--(unclear) '74 [1974], '75 [1975] in Nashville [Tennessee].
Speaker 1: Now is this WVOL [WVOL Radio, Berry Hill, Tennessee]?
Speaker 2: WVOL, that's right.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well tell us about WVOL: what was it when you bought it, and what, what did it become?
Speaker 2: Well WVOL was the first station I made a bid to buy.  When I, when I couldn't close the deal--I couldn't close the deal because I couldn't complete the financing with Salomon Brothers.  I still kept my eye on the station.  It was owned by Mr. Roundesaville, R-O-U-N-D-E-S-A-V-I-L-L-E.  He was in Atlanta [Georgia], and he owned four or five black owned--black program stations.  And finally I was able to come up with another--enough money to make it work.
Speaker 1: So the pro- is the black programing--
Speaker 2: Black programming.  Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) you know, was on the station.
Speaker 2: I was on there (unclear), and then I'm--I was able to buy it.  And I still was the chief financial officer of Meharry Medical College.  So I hired a general manager to run it.  I never have been on the air I just--that was not my deal.  My deal was financially to secure myself.  And then I bought another station, KTPK [KTPK Radio] in Topeka, Kansas--I didn't buy one, I built this one from scratch.  Then I bought 92-Q [WQQK Radio, Goodlettsville, Tennessee]; then I bought two stations in Tupelo [Mississippi] over the next four or five years.
Story_ID: 653160
Speaker 1: KTPK [KTPK Radio] is in Topeka (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Topeka, Kansas.
Speaker 1: Topeka, Kansas; and, then in Tupelo [Mississippi] (unclear).
Speaker 2: Yeah and then 92, 92-Q in Nashville [Tennessee].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: There's another one in Nashville.
Speaker 1: Is that WQQK [WQQK Radio, Goodlettsville, Tennessee]?
Speaker 2: WQQK.  That's right.
Speaker 1: (Unclear).  Okay.
Speaker 2: And then I wanna say--
Speaker 1: Then in Tupelo.
Speaker 2: Then I bought two in Tupelo.  Now that was probably done in nineteen eighty--let's see, '89 [1989] or so.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Two stations there?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And--okay.
Speaker 2: And then
Speaker 1: Were they AM and FM?
Speaker 2: AM and FM.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What were the call letters for those?
Speaker 2: I don't remember them
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: They were--I only had 'em for about a year.  I couldn't make 'em work.  I just couldn't make it work.  But WQQK was a rocker, and I turned it into an urban contemporary station.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And moved to number two in the market.  I held it for seventeen years.  And sold all (unclear)--I sold everything out in 2000.  All of my investments in radios are gone.
Speaker 1: Well what, what are some of the--well what were some of your concerns when you bought, bought these stations?  I mean did you--I mean what did you have to do to, you know, make 'em profitable for (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) They were all profitable.
Speaker 1: They were already?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.  I mean you buy a radio station based on cash flow.  I'm not--I didn't have to turn around anything it just--I'm taking it over (laughter).  The other man wanted to get out, so (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.  So--
Speaker 2: Now 92-Q was not as profitable 'cause it was a rocker--it was a low powered, (unclear) the low powered FM.  Most of the things--for example it was 3,000 watter.  And most of the people had 100,000 watt FMs.  So you--and we had to change the format, and the hot thing at that time was urban contemporary FMs.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And you put the stuff on the air and you just pump the thing up to pipe, and, and you get an audience.
Speaker 1: So was VOL [WVOL Radio, Berry Hill, Tennessee] AM?
Speaker 2: It was AM.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It had six towers, it was a very complicated array.  But I just took the format from one and put it on the other one.  I think that's what helped it to grow and it, it helped subsidize the FM--I mean the AM--
Speaker 1: Okay, so--
Speaker 2: --financially.
Speaker 1: --all right.  So you had the same programming on both stations?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  So--interesting--so, so you hired general managers to run the stations?
Speaker 2: Yeah I had managers to run it, I never (simultaneous) --
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You didn't have to be concerned with the Arbitron ratings [Nielsen Audio] or that sort of thing.
Speaker 2: The ratings and salaries and everything else.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My--most of my time was--I was working for general--(unclear) I mean for--I was working for Meharry [Meharry Medical College, Nashville, Tennessee].  Then I start working for Hospital Affiliates [Hospital Affiliates International, Inc.].  And I would work on the weekends on the radio station.  I would go out there and pull my numbers together and had an accountant, and, and managed it from that distance.
Story_ID: 653161
Speaker 1: What condition was Meharry in when you started working there?
Speaker 2: I was--that was a, a unique situation.  I was recruited by Dr. Lloyd Elam [HistoryMaker Dr. Lloyd C. Elam], he was the president of Meharry at the time.  And he came to New York [New York] and he was looking for somebody with my IT [information technology] computer experience and financial experience to be the chief financial officer.  I was--I must've been thirty years old.  And he was in the process of basically rebuilding Meharry.  We put a $100 million worth of--into, new, new buildings and things like that at Meharry Medical College [Nashville, Tennessee] at that time and there were three people that were critical: Lloyd Elam, was the C- president; Ralph Hines [Ralph H. Hines] was executive vice president; and I was vice president and chief financial officer.
Speaker 1: So this is basically like a rebirth of--
Speaker 2: Rebirth of Meharry.
Speaker 1: --of Meharry.
Speaker 2: I, I'm, I can tell you that it was.  It would have--if we had not--in my opinion.  If we had not invested that $100 million in Meharry and pushing its position for today, then you would probably would have a--it could've closed or merged into Vanderbilt medical school [Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, Tennessee].
Speaker 1: Okay.  So that was an option that could've--
Speaker 2: Yeah they could've done that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But, but what we were doing was counting on national health insurance.  We were counting on national health insurance, so we were building up our classes and investing in--and we're using federal money to do a lot--make a lot of it happen.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And then--
Speaker 1: --that was the strategy that required--to rely on the national health?
Speaker 2: Yeah, and then I, I left there in, I'm trying to think, seventy--I went there in '73 [1973]; I left there in '77 [1977].
Speaker 1: Right, that's what we have here.
Speaker 2: And went to work for Hospital Affiliates [Hospital Affiliates International, Inc.].
Speaker 1: Okay.  And you served as vice president of planning for the INA health care group?
Speaker 2: Well I was--started out as vice president of planning for Hospital Affiliates.  Hospital Affiliates was acquired by INA; and I became thus the vice president of strategic planning for the INA health plan--INA health care.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What, what does the INA stand for?
Speaker 2: Insurance Company of North America [CIGNA].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Based, it was based--insurance company based in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  It has been sold and merged into Connecticut General [Connecticut General Life Insurance Company].
Story_ID: 653162
Speaker 1: All the while you're still, you still have your stations?
Speaker 2: I still have my stations.  That's right.  I kept my stations all the time.  Remember I was--that was gonna be my retirement.  Now I (laughter)--but I've sold them--decided to sell 'em 'cause I--I guess, I had a pretty good offer for 'em; and I just got out of 'em.
Speaker 1: All right, was it, was it--I mean were they easy to--well you said you had like a general manager and--I mean were you ever in danger, any danger of losing money on your stations?
Speaker 2: Well I--well during this period of time I, I did was--I was losing money on 'em for a while; then I--and I had a problem with the bank and they were gonna foreclose on me.  So I, I had learned something about Chapter 11.  One of the bankers--one of my friendly bankers locally said, "Sam [HistoryMaker Samuel Howard] throw, throw the radio stations in Chapter 11, protect yourself from your creditors, and work with the local bank here.  We'll squeeze out the bank in Boston [Massachusetts]."  So he--so I basically took 'em through Chapter 11, brought it out and sold it for 12 million bucks [dollars].
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Very wide grin on your face here.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Right.
Speaker 1: Yeah this is--
Speaker 2: I learn--I still love Chapter 11s.  I look for any business in Chapter 11 (laughter).  If I could buy 'em I'd--'cause you get 'em clean--the debts all clean, everything is all cleaned up.
Speaker 1: So, so this is--you got rid of those in 2000 you said?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I started to get rid of stations early on, and I got rid of those the last two in 2000.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The reason I got 2000 is because, I think it was--that's when the tax law changed.  Capital gains tax went to 15 percent.
Story_ID: 653163
Speaker 1: By the mid-'80s [1980s] you're a senior vice president of Hospital Corporation of America--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --as you're--?
Speaker 2: I was with hospital--INA [Insurance Company of North America; CIGNA].  And in 1981, Hospital Corporation of America bought the hospitals from INA.  And then I became the sen- I became vice president and treasurer of Hospital Corporation of America at that time, it was 1981.  Then I was pr- then Winfield Dunn who was then senior vice president of Hospital Corporation of American, decided to run for governor.  And I was promoted into his position, the vice president of--
Speaker 1: Senior vice president?
Speaker 2: --senior vice president of public affairs.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's right and left the treasurer's job.  And then I stayed on in that position until I left Hospital of Corporation America in 1989--I think that's right.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right, okay, so, now--oh what role does Thomas Frist [Thomas F. Frist, Jr.] play in--?
Speaker 2: Tommy Frist was the founder--one of the founders of HCA; and he was the one that selected me to become vice president and treasurer of HCA.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: There never had been a vice president and treasurer of a major corporation in the country that was black.  I remember making my first call on a bank in Florida and, you know, the- they didn't know me from Adam, and I didn't know them either.  So I called on this bank and we go to meet for breakfast.  And I'm sitting in the, in the restaurant reading my Wall Street Journal [The Wall Street Journal] and they kept looking around for the, for for the guy (laughter) and, and I was the one that they were looking to see.  It was just a funny thing.  Anyways and they were surprised.  But Tommy was--wanted to make a statement.  He really--he's basically one of the god people in this town, and he was making a statement that he wanted diversity in his company.  And I fit one of the bills.  I fit, I, I handled--I served in that capacity.  I stayed--I think I stayed in there until eighty--'89 [1989].
Story_ID: 653164
Speaker 1: And then I decided that I was moving out of healthcare and looked at radio stations; and then I started another healthcare company.  And I think it was '93 [1993], wasn't it?
Speaker 2: Yeah is this Xantus [Xantus Corporation, Nashville, Tennessee]?
Speaker 1: Yeah, we called it Phoenix Healthcare [Phoenix Healthcare Corporation] to begin with, but it ended up being called Xantus.
Speaker 2: All right, and, and what did Xantus do?
Speaker 1: It was an HMO [health maintenance organization].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Medicaid HMO.  The state decided that it was going to put all of the TennCare--all of the Medicaid people into a program called TennCare.  And they were gonna hire these HMOs to manage all of these lives; and I became one of those HMOs.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So, so you formed this yourself?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: This is--you formed Xantus?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: One person with me and the guy name was Stephen Braden [Stephen G. Braden] was a chief financial officer.  And we were it.  I put all the money up.  And we made, we made--we became a $300 million company in five years.
Speaker 2: So this is a--I mean--this is the age of the--well a lot, lot of HMOs were--
Speaker 1: A lot HMOs were formed.  CIGNA is me.  Remember when I told I was strategic planning for INA [Insurance Company of North America]?  The company that I formed in that stra- from that strategic focus for INA was con- INA health plans.  The INA health plans became CIGNA when they merged Connecticut General [Connecticut General Life Insurance Company] and INA together.  And that was defined by--founded by me and Jack Anderson over at 4525 Harding Road in ten- Nashville, Tennessee.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I developed the strategy for CIGNA.  And it's--course I don't have any stock in it (laughter).
Speaker 2: But if you can do that for CIGNA you can do it for anybody?
Speaker 1: I can do it for anybody.  That's, that's right.  And I could do it today.  But it's, it's, lot, lot--it's difficult because one of the things that I did then--that's what that book ['The Flight of the Phoenix: Thoughts on Work and Life,' Samuel H. Howard] is about--State of Tennessee thought that I was misusing the funds and tried to prove that I was pilfering the money from Medicaid; and took me--they fought me for, oh I guess it must been seven or eight years.  But I had enough money to buy- to fight it and I won.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But I'm broke (laughter).
Story_ID: 653165
Speaker 1: So we were talking about--give us the details of this struggle with Xantus [Xantus Corporation, Nashville, Tennessee] and the State of Tennessee and the TennCare program; and--this, the problem starts in 1997 I guess--or starts manifesting itself.
Speaker 2: Well we were doing fine with the INA [Insurance Company of North America; CIGNA] and--I mean between Xantus and the TennCare program until we started incurring a lot of losses in the HMO [health maintenance organization].  And what was happening was the HMO was not getting an actuarially sound premium for the medical expenses associated with the clientele we were getting; so we were losing money.  And at that time I got advice from a lawyer that I should throw it into a receivership--remember receivership is no more than a bankruptcy.  So I have experience in turning out bankruptcy and coming out, and I thought I could do that with this but receivership was somewhat different because the receiver began--this company they--when I did the bankruptcy with the radio stations I became the debtor of possession--I ran the stations.  The receivership required that I turn over the reins to somebody else.  And the people that I turned it over to did their best to discredit me in terms of, you, know, I'd stole money and this, I had a yacht and all dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah.  And the problem is that began to destroy my creditability in the marketplace.  So I decided that I had to fight it; and the reason I had to fight it was because my reputation--they were trying to tie me up with--criminally--that I've stole money from the government.  If you stile--steal money from the government, all they wanna do is put you in jail.  I was--this is a long story, and I'm, and--
Speaker 1: Go ahead.  This is--yeah.
Story_ID: 653166
Speaker 1: I was in Calif- in Topeka, Kansas with my brother-in-law [Marvin Wilson].  And my brother-in-law, I told him what was going on with me and TennCare and HMO [health maintenance organization] and I showed him some clippings in the paper about my name and how I absconded with money.  And my brother-in-law had a lawyer, friend of his, who was a criminal lawyer, African American, Joe Johnson [ph.], another Johnson (laughter).
Speaker 2: Another, right.
Speaker 1: But what he did was, he came in and read all that stuff, he said, "Sam [HistoryMaker Samuel Howard], this is really serious," 'cause I didn't think it was that serious 'cause I said I didn't do anything, you know, if you th- if you're innocent you don't--a person that's innocent doesn't really go around looking for any bad stones.  And he told me that I had better go call his--"You need to get, get you and a lawyer and fight this."  And so he got on the phone and he called guy named Bob Ritchie [Robert W. Ritchie], who is a Knoxville [Tennessee] criminal attorney that's a good friend of his.  And Mr. Ritchie told me that when I landed to return from Topeka to Nashville, pick up two boxes of stuff on the papers and come to Knoxville--that's where he was.  And I then engaged them to fight the case, and it took about $2 million.  But the point is that when we got through with it, it was--they couldn't find anything.  But I think it was more racially based in Nashville, Tennessee--that's what I think happened.
Speaker 2: If you hadn't had $2 million to fight it, what would've happened?  You would've been in jail?
Speaker 1: I could have been--I'd of had to compromise in some fashion I'm sure.  But I was fortunate enough to have that kind of cash because I had the radio stations.  I sold them.  I had some other things--and what, what I also had at the time was a very good reputation in the business community.  I never went underground; I was visible.  I was chairman of the chamber of commerce [Nashville Area Chamber of Commerce] at one point.  I mean I was visible.  And so most of the people they just say, "Sam, we don't believe them anyway."  Especially my people who I'd worked with at Hospital Affiliates [Hospital Affiliates International, Inc.], HCA [Hospital Corporation of America], Tommy Frist [Thomas F. Frist, Jr.], all of them said that you all are wrong.  And there was a--all the fellas were doing were lying, they tried to--they lied, and, and that's what that book ['The Flight of the Phoenix: Thoughts on Life and Work, Samuel H. Howard] is about.  The last chapters of that book was about all of the trouble that went through--I went through.  And then the last chapter is when I said: "It is finished."  That's when they came to me and says we wanna settle and we wanna pay you.  But I could not get all of the--my money back, my legal expenses and you can't write it off.  You cannot write off your criminal expenses (unclear).
Speaker 2: So you take a beating?
Speaker 1: You take a beating.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yes.  But I, I, I learned a lot, but it's, it's, it's tough.  But I still have my reputation.
Story_ID: 653167
Speaker 1: It's interesting, now you named your comp- your company Phoenix Holdings [Phoenix Holdings, Inc.] before you even--I mean, or Phoenix Communications [Phoenix Communications Group, Inc.] and stuff before you even had this crisis?
Speaker 2: I had a Phoenix Communications in New York [New York].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Phoenix has always been name associated with coming from the ashes.  Remember the bird, that's what that book ['The Flight of the Phoenix: Thoughts on Life and Work,' Samuel H. Howard] is about.
Speaker 1: Absolutely, so (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Everything comes from--I bo- everything I had built, I built from nothing, all of my life.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Piece, pieced it together with nickels and dimes and wire (laughter) and make it work.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, so this is--this crisis was over by 2000?
Speaker 2: Two thousand [2000].  Was it 2000, that's right.
Speaker 1: Yeah, so, yeah, just?
Speaker 2: But it was, it was hurdle--I mean it was really, it--strain on my wife [Karan Howard].  My children [Anica Howard and Samuel Howard II], everything else.  My son was not able to get a job because he had what?  The same name.  And when you pull up Google, he pulls up Samuel H. Howard and all this stuff about Sam Howard [HistoryMaker Samuel Howard] on it.  It's cleared up now I think, but.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, so it's the, the--like the people that took over at Xantus [Xantus Corporation, Nashville, Tennessee] officially closes it in 2000.
Speaker 2: They closed and I--they didn't need to close it.  I tried politically to get them to just give it back to me.  I, I'd make it work, but we couldn't make it happen.  And I got a letter just this--two weeks ago.  I read a law- letter from the lawyer that I had sent my book to and he, he was my lawyer on the civil side and he said, "Sam, I read your book, it's very interesting.  But there's one thing I want you to remember: I was not the lawyer that recommended that you go into receivership," and that just occurred to me just the pa- two weeks ago that I made a mistake in trusting the judgment of the lawyer that took me into receivership.  I wouldn't have, I wouldn't have gone through this--or let's put it this way: the process would've been different.
Speaker 1: So receivership was a big, big mistake in all this?
Speaker 2: It was a big mistake on my part.
Speaker 1: Is there any, any--is there any circumstance where receivership makes sense, I mean?
Speaker 2: If--I think if I had--if you can get what I'd call the debtor in possession role of a receiver, you can become the receiver, you can make it work.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But remember these people once they got in there, they, they were making $200,000 a year in salary and they been working for the government and this is the best money they've ever made.  And that--they got a $300 million company to play with.  I mean the company's 300 million in revenue.  We had grown from zero to 300 million.
Speaker 1: Well--I mean--I think one of the themes of this interview is that you certainly think big--I mean you know?
Speaker 2: Well that's, that's, that was a book that Donald Trump wrote ['Think Big: Make It Happen in Business and Life'].  He said if you're gonna think you might as well think big--it takes the same amount of work (laughter).
Speaker 1: That's something.  So-now--yeah it says here that on November the 20th of 2006 Tennessee dismissed the $9 million lawsuit against you.
Speaker 2: (Nods head) (Unclear).
Speaker 1: So this is 2006, this is, you know, you were exonerated--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --I guess by the government a little earlier than that; and then Tennessee--?
Speaker 2: That's right.  The--Ritchie [Robert W. Ritchie] got his work--criminal work done first, we did not--we had to get the criminal work done first and I don't, I don't have the documents here but I did take 'em home--that exonerated me from everything; and once that was done then the civil lawyers went to work, Bob Walker's [ph.] law firm went to work on getting the other matters dismissed.  And that took 'em another year or so.  But my criminal lawyers were the best, they were the best.  Strong Christian men.  All of 'em were strong Christian men.  One went on to become a bishop in the Episcopal church.  But those were the people that I went to--when I left Topeka [Kansas], got in my car and went down there.  But you know what they told me I had to do when was I--before they started to work for me?  I had to write 'em a check for 250 thousand dollars--that's to start.  (Laughter) It was not gonna be cheap.  So I just wrote 'em a check.
Speaker 1: So this--but this, you know, it's a victory, but as you, you were saying before the break this is a--you took a huge financial hit?
Speaker 2: Oh financial oh yes.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: That's right (simultaneous).
Story_ID: 653168
Speaker 1: So what did you--I mean you're an entrepreneur now, so what did you do?
Speaker 2: Well (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What did you, what did you have left; and what did you, what did you do?
Speaker 2: Well I had a little company out in Arkansas called AMCO.  It was a PPO, PPO is a preferred provider organization that does not take risk.  And I had that--it was--when--remember when I told you that they came after me?  I spun that off from Xantus [Xantus Corporation, Nashville, Tennessee] and put into--put it in a little pot over here by myself and I paid myself out of that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: For the rest of, for the rest of the period.
Speaker 1: It was called Anco [sic.]?
A-M-C-O: Arkansas Managed Care Organization [Arkansas Managed Care Organization, Inc.].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Almost like the transmission (laughter)?
Speaker 2: That's right, that's right.
Speaker 1: Amco, okay.  All right.
Speaker 2: And then I, I got a--got involved with a fella, they had trouble with a pie company so I now own 69 percent of Am- Arkansas--I mean--
Speaker 1: Is that Mama Turney's?
Speaker 2: Mama Turney's Homemade Pies [Mama Turney's Homemade Pies, Inc.].  I own fi- 69 percent of it.  We turned it round, it's making a little bit of money made--gave me a dividend of forty thousand dollars last year which is pretty good.  And I sold AMCO this year, in February.  And I gotta do something else, so something's gotta come.  I think the--some doctors came over here to talk to me about helping them expand their medical practice, and so I'm looking at that for when I get back from vacation.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  And how does the advent of the national health cla- care plan affect?
Speaker 2: Well I think it put me out of business in Arkansas.  Because, you know, private--I was working with the market of--self-insured market, and people quit buying health insurance as long that was going on because they didn't, they didn't know what Obamacare [Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010] was gonna be like.  So I just basically was not growing; and I found somebody who could take the company and who wanted to feed it.  I was just tired.
Story_ID: 653169
Speaker 1: Is there an economic o- opportunity I mean in (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Not right now for me.  I don't know whether there is one.  I, I don't, I'm, I don't think it's the--I think it was a bad bill.  And I think it was a bad bill, not because the president [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama] did it 'cause I don't think the president knew anything about it.  I think the people that made the bill bad was the House [U.S. House of Representatives] leaders and the senator's, con- I mean House leadership in the committees.  That--what they did was they made a bad bill; and then all of 'em begin to resign.  They're all leaving, but--
Speaker 1: So is it, you, you think it's bad for the--for business or (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I think it's gotta be it gotta be, it's bad for everybody.  Its gotta be changed.
Speaker 1: Okay.  How would you change it?
Speaker 2: I--you know, the president has made twenty something changes to the bill right now.  I'd make 'em permanent, I'd make 'em permanent.  And I would probably--you know, Ryan's bill?  Ryan [Paul Ryan] in the ways and [House Committee on Ways and Means]--guess where that came from?  Sam Howard [HistoryMaker Samuel Howard].  I was on the Medicare commission that he's referring to every time he makes--he says, "I got this idea from the Medicare commission--bipartisan commission on Medicare," and I was the one who drafted it for that.  It's in my computer.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  This is Ryan who ran for vice president--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --last election.
Speaker 2: He likes it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It's a voucher system, basically that's what it is.  And that--all these advantage plans and things that--that's what--that's the way we should go.  And it's what TennCare was when I went into it too.  You give the people of--the money and they will pick a plan.  And they had ten plans to choose from in Nashville [Tennessee].  And we were doing well because we started off with eighteen thousand people the first year of our TennCare business--eighteen thousand, and we made money.  We made $2 million profit.  And then we--other companies began to merge with us and we got up about 180,000 and you--if you do a good job, health care and the people can move around based on their voucher that they have, it'll work.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: It works.  And I tell you, the difference between people who are poor and people who are rich is money.  (Laughter) You give the people money, they can stretch a dollar faster than a rich--longer than a rich man can, 'cause they never had it before and they know how to do it.  That's New York [New York].  I learned that when I was in New York.  The people said (laughter) the power went off.  And they said, "What do we do?"  Said the power wasn't on down in, in Harlem [New York, New York] anyway, so (laughter).
Story_ID: 653170
Speaker 1: Now in 2007--well, well before talk about the publishing of the book ['The Flight of the Phoenix: Thoughts on Life and Work, Samuel H. Howard].  Just, so what's next, you're, you're like coiled here ready for another opportunity (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah I'm going to do something.  I don't what it is yet.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I'm not gonna worry about it today.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But no, I'm, I'm--what I do now--I'm chairman of the board of Nashville Electric Service, so that's the power company, it's a $1.3 billion business in Nashville [Tennessee]--I'm chairman.  I also am a director--national director of the Urban League [National Urban League]; and am chair- chairman emeritus of the Urban League in Tennes- in Nashville [Urban League of Middle Tennessee, Nashville, Tennessee].  I'm on the board of Pathway Lending [Nashville, Tennessee].  It's a $65 million nonprofit community development bank.  So I'm working with that because they--it's--bank boards I don't get on, but nonprofit bank boards because this mission helps me fund minority businesses and small businesses and, and that kind of thing, so I like that.  And, I think that's, that's about what I'm doing every day.  Two weeks of the month I really work hard.  The last two weeks of the month--the first two weeks of the month, I don't have much to do (laughter).
Speaker 1: So how do you spend your time, you just kind of?
Speaker 2: I come in here.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Look at the walls.  No, no I--most of the time I'm--people come to me, talk to me about business.  I'm seventy-five [years old], so I have a lot of consulting I do for free, 'cause they know I'm--I've been around a long time.  I know how this town works; and I use a Rolodex of four thousand people to help people.
Story_ID: 653171
Speaker 1: This is why you'd be a tremendously valuable asset to the Urban League [Urban League of Middle Tennessee, Nashville, Tennessee] in terms of their (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.  Yeah that's what happened when the Urban League got in trouble here in Nashville [Tennessee], they came to me and asked me would I help.  That was ten years ago.  And I said, "Yes, but you've got to have your board to resign."  And everybody did; and we brought in a new president and I got on the telephone.
Speaker 1: Now the Urban League, I've heard of several Ur- Urban Leagues closing down in cities.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  But we weren't gonna close this one down.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No.  I just called HCA [Hospital Corporation of America], call- (laughter) called all of my friends and they came to, came to the rescue.
Speaker 1: So that's--if--well if you weren't able to do, do that was there anyone else here (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, they may be--they, they came to me and my wife [Karan Howard], leaned on me to do something, so I said, "Fine."
Speaker 1: Okay.  So your book, 'Flight of the Phoenix: Thoughts on Work and Life' ['The Flight of the Phoenix: Thoughts on Work and Life,' Samuel H. Howard] was published in 2007?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: What is your intent by publishing your story?
Speaker 2: I was just--what I--that book started out as a--therapy.  You know I was going through all of these challenges with the state and everybody else.  So I just started writing and I hired a writer--young lady to help me out with organizing it and putting it together in a book.  And my wife says I needed to do another book because a lot of people don't know how we came out, they didn't read the last chapter.  When--"It is finished," Jesus was on the cross.  They--those were his last--"It is finished"; and that's--they didn't read that chapter which said that we won.  So right now I am just relaxing.  I work with the Urban League [National Urban League] on a national level.  Get them to form a CDFI so the Urban League will have a bank that'll sell--help minority businesses all over the United States.  We got it formed, and I'm on the board of that.  So I'll be doing these similar kind of things (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So where was that formed, the Urban League?
Speaker 2: ABout, about a year ago.
Speaker 1: Community development bank?
Speaker 2: Community development financial institution.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: CDFI.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I like Marc Morial [HistoryMaker Marc H. Morial], so I--whatever he wants me to do, I'll do; and that's about it.  I'm not looking for anything.  The--these doctors came by here let's say about a week ago.  I went up and saw a business that they have up in Kentucky.  And while I'm gone, they're gonna be putting some numbers together and we may help 'em expand that business when I get back, but I won't put any money in it because, just I think we can do it without it.
Story_ID: 653172
Speaker 1: We always ask this question: what are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: Well, that's a good question.  You're asking me to think.  I think there's a lot of opportunities for African Americans if they would quit playing the victim card.  They, they somehow spent so much time and so much energy on playing the victim card that they can't focus on what they can do themselves, for themselves; and that's what I--so I would--my challenge is that, get over it and focus on what you can do for yourself and you'll be fine.
Story_ID: 653173
Speaker 1: Now when you look back on everything you've done to this point, is there any major decision--well I know one, the receivership (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The receivership.
Speaker 1: --that you would do again?
Speaker 2: That's right that would, that would be one.
Speaker 1: That would be one?
Speaker 2: That's basically all.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: 'Cause I mean I was--we were gonna be, you know--I owned that HMO [health maintenance organization] 300 million?  I owned 90 percent of it personally, so that's a lot (laughter).  My daughter [Anica Howard] is she, she was my chief operating officer, and my son [Samuel Howard II] was a financial person within the company [Xantus Corporation, Nashville, Tennessee].  And many people think about us every day they'd--people call me up, says, "Whenever you get ready, Mr. Howard [HistoryMaker Samuel Howard], we're ready to come back to work for you."  All of my employees from radio stations.  They always have a get together every three or four months and they call us, "Mr. Howard we got a--we got a get together at a restaurant," we go and have dinner with them, my wife [Karan Howard] and I, so.
Speaker 1: What did you look for in employees?  I thought this a good time to ask this I think maybe.  I don't know if I've ever asked anyone?
Speaker 2: People who are willing to go the extra mile.  If they're not willing to go the extra mile--and no complaining.  We don't have any complaints; and they didn't--and I think what I did with all of my employees, if I asked them to stay late, I'll stay late too.  I'm right there with you, so.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And being in this city I'm--I feel very proud of my reputation in terms of help--I've helped a lot--in that book, you'll find four companies, executives that I helped.  It's 'The Flight of the Phoenix' ['The Flight of the Phoenix: Thoughts on Work and Life,' Samuel H. Howard]--coming from the ashes?  What you have in there is what I've done.  And then how I brought four other people along with me next, next round.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  Well, well who are they, maybe we'll just talk (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Darrell Freeman, Darrell Freeman that runs a company called Zycron [Zycron, Inc.]--he now has Zycron, now has a bank and a construction company.  And he will tell you that the person that helped him--giving him--it was me.  Mike wa- Mike Turney, Mama Turney's Homemade Pies [Mama Turney's Homemade Pies, Inc.].  And for--then we have another gentleman, he runs a clock company--there's a, cleaning company for office buildings.  He now cleans a lot of business, businesses in Nashville [Tennessee] for the city and for the state.  And then there was a young lady who ran the convention center for us for about twenty years--the first convention center in Nashville; and she was a white female, and she, she's retired.
Story_ID: 653174
Speaker 1: Tell us about your family?  You mentioned your son and your daughter [Anica Howard] work, working in the business--you have how many children?
Speaker 2: Two.
Speaker 1: Two, two okay.  A son and a daughter (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Son and a daughter.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Well my daughter right now is--my daughter has a bachelor's degree in--from Georgia Tech [Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia].  Master's degree from Duke [Duke University, Durham, North Carolina] in business.  A master's from Oral Roberts [Oral Roberts University, Tulsa, Oklahoma] in ministry; and she's working on her doctorate in the ministry.  And she runs a small church [Mt. Zion A.M.E. Church] (laughter) right outside Centerville [Tennessee], which is about fifty miles from here.
Speaker 1: A Baptist?
Speaker 2: That's an A.M.E. church.
Speaker 1: A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal]?  Okay.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So that's, that's the one--she adopted two children she's about fift- forty something this--she'll be fifty years old and she wanted some children, so she's adopted about four years ago, two children; and their pictures are back there.
Speaker 1: And she served as a financial officer?
Speaker 2: She was a chief operating officer.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Her background is--she's an industrial engineer.  She know how to ma- runs things.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My son is with Amerigroup, which is an HMO company.  They tried to buy us [Xantus Corporation, Nashville, Tennessee] at one time; and he's with them as a financial officer, running an HMO [health maintenance organization] you know, as a financial officer for an HMO in, in Texas--El Paso.  So, but he had a tough time because of, you know his name is the same--he's Sam Howard II [Samuel Howard II].  So a lot of that stuff fell on him (unclear).
Speaker 1: But he's, he's--?
Speaker 2: He's coming back.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He'll be fine.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: So you, know, he's a Howard (laughter) (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) (Laughter) Okay.
Story_ID: 653175
Speaker 1: Now did your wife [Karan Howard] ever play an official role in your businesses or did she just (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No.  She did in the radio stations at one time, 92-Q [WQQK Radio, Goodlettsville, Tennessee].  But I think that, that's one of the things that I regret--maybe I don't regret--it's just one of the things that it just doesn't work.  You know, you need to get away from your business sometimes.  Now I do (unclear)--give, you know, talk to her about more today than in my earlier days.  In my earlier days, I did not discuss business at the house.  I didn't.  And when I was with the hos- treasurer of HCA [Hospital Corporation of America] and all those positions, I very rarely discussed business at home.
Speaker 1: Do you think it's important to have a place where you don't?
Speaker 2: To--where you don't do it.  And you go home and you go to see--you have, you have to have dinner with your children.  So you have dinner with them and you listen.  'Cause they'll tell you what they want to talk about.
Story_ID: 653176
Speaker 1: We had a note in here that you were a Boy Scout leader at one point?
Speaker 2: Well I was a--I, I'm--not a leader.  I became a beaver, which means I raised a lot of funds for Boy Scouts [Boy Scouts of America] in Nashville [Tennessee].  So I've, I've been appointed a beaver.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So--but, I, I do a lot for raising funds for boys; and 100 Black Men [100 Black Men of Middle Tennessee, Inc.], for example, is one of the things that I'm very proud off.
Speaker 1: You founded the Nashville chapter?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And what--it was--nurture and enhance the growth and development of young black males in Tennessee that's our mission.  And the reason we can--I can say it is because before every meeting we stand up after prayer and say that mission.  So every man who's been a member of the 100 Black Men will say that mission.  And we've given around 300,000 [dollars] in scholarships.  And so we'll, we'll still--we ta- we don't take a student and work with him for just a year.  We take a guy in the seventh grade and take him all the way through college, give him financial support, and whatever support he needs.  And then--but we don't take a lot of them, we just take one whole class through; then we come back and get another class.  And it's--the organization's about twenty years old.  I think it's done a good job.  I probably still the only founder that's heavily involved.
Speaker 1: That's still with it.
Speaker 2: You know, I--the--people just want me to be--they want me to be there.  They want me to be there and they want to talk to me because they, they know my passion for things and, and I'm willing to give 'em my--bit of my wisdom.  We had dinner over here last night; and every time I go they just--they come and start talking (laughter), asking me questions.  These are young men who are black and whatever--they want to--they wanna talk.

Speaker 1: You've been married for over fifty years?
Speaker 2: Fifty-one years.
Speaker 1: Fifty-one years.  Yeah, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, long time.
Speaker 1: Is there a secret to being married that long?
Speaker 2: Do what your wife says (laughter).  No, I, I think, you know, I don't know what the secret--I mean you, you have to love your wife, that's one thing.  And, and but we have just--we have really loved each other.  We have not had any major flare ups or anything like that.  And she [Karan Howard] trusts me and I trust her.  As I said, this is one woman that I, I could be making a lot of money; and a lot of men, you know, they worry about the--they give their wife the checkbook, and they end up broke.  I don't worry about that.  I got a--and then she's a business person too.  She has run her own real estate agency, so she's got other--she, she can do other things too.  And she loves to work with children that's--now that's her, that's her--loves to work with children.  She's worked with unwed mothers for about twenty years in Nashville, Tennessee.  She doesn't work--or she doesn't go to--she doesn't like social things, you know.  She wants to work with kids.

Speaker 1: --and see the?  Okay.
Speaker 2: No.  They know I got a job.  But they didn't--they weren't benefits of all this stuff.
Speaker 1: Did they--were they around when you, you know, finished Stanford [Stanford University, Stanford, California] or did they?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  But I just, just knew I was getting to a job that's all.
Speaker 1: When you were a White House Fellow did they--?
Speaker 2: Yeah they knew that.  But they probably didn't appreciate what that was about.  I never did come back home for anything like that.  I very rarely came--went home once they died.
Speaker 1: When did they pass away?
Speaker 2: My father [Houston Howard] was--he was--sixty-nine or seventy [years old].  It's been almost twenty years now.
Speaker 1: What, in the '80s [1980s] I guess?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Okay.
Speaker 2: He had cancer.  And my mother [Nellie Gaines Howard] had a stroke.  And that's, you know, that's one of the things that our family has a lot of hypertension problems.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I do too so.
Speaker 1: So you don't think they really fully appreciated what you were doing?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My, my siblings [Lula Howard, Callie Howard and Maurice Howard] do, my siblings do.  But everybody's on their own. They're taking care of themselves just like everybody else.  They're not asking for anything.  They're--my daughter--Callie, my sister, she's so proud of the fact that she's--went through school--went through special education teaching and is retired and able to live on what she's got.  Now she, she has a house, you know.  We, she's living in the family house [in Lawton, Oklahoma].  But it's so clean and immaculate.  It's like my mother used to be there.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I'm so proud of her.

Speaker 1: Is there anything we haven't talked about before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I--you, you've covered it pretty well (laughter).  You went down to the--I think you've done very well at the chronology so.
Speaker 1: So well it's two questions actually.  They're related, but the first one is sir, when you look back at what you've done, you know, in your business life, what would you consider to be your professional legacy?
Speaker 2: (Pause) I just think the legacy should be--let me think.  (Pause) When I went to school at Oklahoma State University [Stillwater, Oklahoma] there were no blacks in business.  And if I had taken the suggestion of those people that said, "You--why are you in this (unclear)?"   I would never have been able to walk through the doors that I was able to walk through at all.  I would've been a laborer like my father [Houston Howard].  So I say to young men, you--future you don't know what holds for you, just be prepared.  Go get prepared.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 653180
Speaker 1: The last question is very similar to legacy but a little bit more personal.  Sir, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: As a man who was prepared.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: When the door opened, I was able to walk through the door, and, and hold my name high.  And I always did what my mama [Nellie Gaines Howard] said: good name is better to be chosen than all the riches of the world [Proverbs 21:1].  And I wanna be known for that, and when I die that's what I want to be on my tombstone: a good name.
