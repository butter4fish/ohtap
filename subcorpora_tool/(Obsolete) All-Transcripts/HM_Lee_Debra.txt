Story_ID: 56826
Speaker 1: And let's talk a little bit about your family history.  Can you tell me, what's your mother's name?  What was your mother's name?
Speaker 2: My mother's name was Delma Louise Taylor Lee.
Speaker 1: And how do you spell Delma?
Speaker 2: D-E-L-M-A.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Can you tell me, what's your first memories of your mother?
Speaker 2: Well, I'd say the first memories of my mother I guess was in Frankfurt, Germany.  When I was six months old, my family moved from South Carolina to Germany.  My father [Richard McLeish Lee] was in the [U.S.] Army.  And I think that my first recollections of my mother are her taking care of us while we lived on the Army base in Germany.
Speaker 1: And when you say "us," you have siblings, right?
Speaker 2: That's correct.
Speaker 1: How many siblings do you have?
Speaker 2: I have three siblings:  an older sister, an older brother, and then I have a half-brother, who's older also.
Speaker 1: What did your mother do for an occupation?
Speaker 2: Well, my mother had several occupations.  I would say the bulk of her career was spent as a ward clerk for various different hospitals.  Again, we moved around a lot, so it depended on where we lived.  She also went to school to be a hairdresser.  But after doing hair for a while, she decided she liked manicures and pedicures better.  So, she did that for a while.  But most of her time was spent as a ward clerk.  She moved to Washington [D.C.] after I did, over thirty years ago.  And she worked at Children's Hospital here for many years.  And then when she retired from there, she actually came to BET as worked as the sixth floor receptionist here until she retired, when she was eighty-two [years old].
Story_ID: 56827
Speaker 1: So, let's back when you're a little girl, and you're in Germany.  How long were you in Germany?
Speaker 2: We lived in Germany four years.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, you got there when you were six months old?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: But you still have memories of Germany?
Speaker 2: Not, I don't have a lot of memories of Germany, but I do remember some things about it.  I remember my mom [Delma Louise Taylor Lee], and that must have been because she was home most of the time.  I don't remember that for sure, but I do have memories of her.  I remember my father [Richard McLeish Lee] being in the military.  I remember a couple of my friends, one named Susie, because the song "Wake Up Little Susie" was popular, and my dad used to tease me about her.  So, I don't have a lot of memories of Germany, but I do have some.  I remember a little bit about nursery school.  I started nursery school in Germany.
Story_ID: 56828
Speaker 1: Now, okay, so your father was in the military?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Tell us a little--what was your father's name?
Speaker 2: My father's name was Richard McLeish Lee.
Speaker 1: Can you spell McLeish for us, please?
Speaker 2: Sure.  It's M-c, capital L, E-I-S-H.
Speaker 1: Is there a story behind that name at all?
Speaker 2: Oooh, there's a very long story (laughter) behind that name.  But, basically from what I'm told, my ancestry on my father's side was Scottish.  There was a boat called the 'Bonhomme'--a ship called the 'Bonhomme Richard', which started in Scotland.  There were some Richards onboard that ship.  They came to America.  I think they stopped in Barbados on the way, but I'm not a hundred percent sure about that.  But they ended up in Charleston, South Carolina.  And my father's family is from Charleston.  His mother's name was Louise McLeish.  And so, you know, we have some Scottish in our ancestry.  I've never done a full search.  I plan to do it one day.  But my dad used to tell me the story all the time.  I had some relatives who fought in the American Revolution.  I remember my aunt tried to join the Daughters of the American Revolution (laughter).  But I don't think they were ready for an African American woman to be part of that organization.  But so, that's where the name McLeish comes from.
Speaker 1: So, on your father's side you had the Scottish-African American?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: What about on your mother's [Delma Louise Taylor Lee] side?  Do you know the--
Speaker 2: I don't know very much about my mother's side at all.  She passed away two years ago, almost three years ago now.  And you know, she just never talked about her background as my--just my father did.  She didn't talk about it very much at all.  And when she passed away, I realized that she was not a hundred percent sure who her father was.  There was a man that she thought was her father, but she had a different father than her brother and sister.  So, I can't trace her family back very far.  She came from Hopkinsville, Kentucky.  That's where she was born.  And she grew up in Chicago, Illinois.  But I don't know very much about her family.
Speaker 1: So, you don't know--did you know any of her siblings--aunts, uncles?
Speaker 2: I did.  Not very well, but I met them a couple of times.  She had one sister and one brother that I know of.
Speaker 1: So, on your father's side then, you knew your father's side better?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 56829
Speaker 1: What's your first recollection of your father [Richard McLeish Lee]?
Speaker 2: Well, my first recollection of my father is in a military uniform.  He was an officer in the [U.S.] Army.  I think when I was a child, he was a captain.  So, I remember him, you know, in his Army khaki officer's uniform.  I remember the hat.  And, you know, I remember him being a very prominent fixture in our family.  You know, everything revolved around my father (laughter), from what I recall.  He was the, you know, commander in chief in our family.  And so, we moved around his schedule and around his career.  I know my mother [Delma Louise Taylor Lee] worked hard to always keep him happy.  But I also remember him being a very caring, loving father in a very different way.  He wasn't outwardly affectionate but, you know, I always knew he really loved me.  I was the youngest.  And he focused a lot of attention on me and really, you know, inspired me to do well in school and to have a career.  So, you know, I have fond memories of my father.  When I was very young, I think in the third or fourth grade, he went away to Korea for about two years.  He was stationed in Korea.  And during that time, we moved to L.A. [Los Angeles, California] to be near my mother's half-sister.  And I remember missing him a lot, those two years that he was away, and being very happy when he came back home.
Story_ID: 56830
Speaker 1: Now, you talk about you're the youngest.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: What's the age difference between you and your siblings?
Speaker 2: My brother [Ronald Lee] is three years older than I am, and my sister [Gretta Lee] is nine years older than I am.
Speaker 1: So, when you were a small child, did you play more with one sibling than the other sibling?
Speaker 2: I was closer to my brother.
Speaker 1: The one that was the--
Speaker 2: Yeah, who was three years older than I am.  And my sister was a presence.  And then very early on she went away to college, when I was probably in about the sixth grade.  So, you know, she was, she was more like a second mother to me.  She was more like that than a sibling.  She was my babysitter, (laughter), my strict babysitter.  (laughter)
Story_ID: 56831
Speaker 1: So, let's go a little more into your childhood.  Think about sounds and smells, the early sounds and smells that you can think of as a child in your household--things that you remember the most--what they smelled like, what they sounded like.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I remember, you know, there always being kids around.  I guess that was because I had siblings, and friends.  My mother [Delma Louise Taylor Lee] was a very good cook, so there was always some great smell, whether it was fried chicken or ham or leg of lamb.  So, I always remember it being, you know, good food smells around.  I also remember there being a lot of music around.  My parents were big jazz fans.  My mother had gone to school with Dinah Washington, and I remember she was very proud of that fact.  My father's [Richard McLeish Lee] cousin was a trumpeter named Willie Smith, who he was close to.  And he played for several big bands--James Lunceford Band--  I think he played with Duke Ellington.  So, we always had the big 78 records (laughter) and the 33-1/2s.  And I think I still have a pretty good jazz collection from my parents.  So, I always remember there was music around.  They, both of my parents really loved to entertain.  My mother was a great seamstress.  She also liked to knit and crochet.  So, I always remember, you know, at Christmastime or during holidays she was always making gifts.  She made most of my clothes when I was growing up.  She taught me how to sew and knit and crochet.  I know how to do all of that.  So, I think the, you know, the most I remember is sounds of music and good food cooking.
Story_ID: 56832
Speaker 1: Do you have, did you know your grandparents on either side?
Speaker 2: I did not know my grandparents on my father's [Richard McLeish Lee] side.  They died.  I think my grandmother was the last to pass away, when I was a baby.  So, I don't remember her at all.  I do remember my grandparents.  I remember my mother's [Delma Louise Taylor Lee] mother and her husband, who was not my mother's-- was not my real grandfather--was not my mother's father.  So, I got to know them, as a teenager.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, when you were a child, you did not know your grandparents?
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: So, now, let's--now, you say you're in Germany from six months--
Speaker 2: Uh huh.
Speaker 1: --to basically four years?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And you went to nursery school in Germany?
Speaker 2: I did.
Speaker 1: Do you remember nursery school?
Speaker 2: Not very much.  There's one picture of me holding a doll, that's still around.  You know, so that's really the only thing I remember about it.  But I assume it was on the [U.S.] Army base, but I'm not a hundred percent sure of that.
Speaker 1: Do you remember the house that you lived in?  Was it a military house or--
Speaker 2: It was a military house.  I want to--I don't know that it was a house.  It may have been an apartment building.  But I know it was on the military base.  So, I don't remember very much about that.
Story_ID: 56833
Speaker 1: So, take us from Germany to where next you end up in life.
Speaker 2: Well, when I was four years old, we moved to Washington, D.C. [District of Columbia].  And my father [Richard McLeish Lee] was stationed in Washington for a couple of years.  And he taught ROTC [Reserve Officers' Training Corps] at Howard University.  And I remember that.  And I remember our house in Washington.  We lived off of Missouri Avenue in Northeast Washington.  No, it was Northwest Washington, Fourth and Oglethorpe Street, I remember.  And I remember it was a great neighborhood.  I had good friends within blocks of where I lived.  The elementary school I went to was in the neighborhood.  My brother went to the junior high school.  My sister went to Coolidge High School.
Speaker 1: Now, about what year would this have been?
Speaker 2: This would have been 1958 till about '62 [1962] maybe.  I think we lived in Washington three to four years.
Speaker 1: So, you're starting kindergarten then?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And what was the name of your elementary school again?
Speaker 2: I think it was Whittier Elementary School.
Speaker 1: And did--
Speaker 2: I remember I moved around a lot (laughter).  Don't hold me to that, but I think that was the name of it.
Speaker 1: Do you remember any of your teachers there?
Speaker 2: You know, I don't.  I more remember my friends and their parents in the neighborhood.
Speaker 1: Well, tell me a little bit about your friends then.
Speaker 2: I remember, you know, it was a very mixed neighborhood racially.  I had black friends and white friends.  I remember particularly two young girls I was friendly with, who I've actually seen at church since I've been back in D.C., the Hobans (ph).  I remember their dad was an architect.  I remember the family that lived across the street that was friendly with my parents.  So, that's--I can remember the layout of the neighborhood.  I remember the alley I used to go down to get to my friend's house to play.  I remember my mother used to tell me to be home before the street lights came on.  I just thought it was the craziest thing, because how do you know when they're going to come on until they come on?  And I also remember her coming down the alley with a switch when I was late (laughter), because they came on before I knew it.  But I remember it was a very nurturing neighborhood, and it was a fun place to grow up.  I remember my first parties were there.  I remember, you know--I don't remember which birthday it was--maybe six, when I had an all girls' party.  You know, they all wore pinafores and, you know, prindle (ph) skirts, or whatever.  So, I remember having a party in my backyard.  My aunt lived in Washington, my father's sister.  My father and his two sisters all went to Dunbar High School.  So my aunt, one of my aunts, still lived in D.C., and she had a son who I was close to.  So, I just remember it being a great time.
Speaker 1: Do you remember having a favorite teacher or favorite thing that you were studying in school?
Speaker 2: I do not.  I don't remember very much about school at all.
Speaker 1: At that point--
Speaker 2: At that point, right.
Speaker 1: --when you were in grammar school?
Speaker 2: Yeah, first and second grade.  I don't, I mean, I remember being happy and enjoying school, but I don't remember very much about it.
Speaker 1: Now, so you're--how long--so, you leave Washington?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: After how many years?
Speaker 2: I think about three years.
Story_ID: 56834
Speaker 1: And where do you go after that [after leaving Washington, District of Columbia]?
Speaker 2: Then we moved to Los Angeles [California].  Then we lived in Compton, California for two years.
Speaker 1: So, you're in grade school in Compton, California?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And this is, brings us to like 1962, '63 [1963], around that timeframe?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I was in grade school in L.A. [Los Angeles], in fourth and fifth grade.
Speaker 1: So, tell me about your Los Angeles experience versus your Washington, D.C. experience.  You're a little older now.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Probably more serious about school?
Speaker 2: Uh huh.  And I know at this point it was clear I did well in school.  I remember my father [Richard McLeish Lee] promised me a dollar for every 'A' I brought home--getting lots of money that way (laughter).  I remember that the California school system--felt like it was much more advanced than the D.C. school system.  I remember at one point they wanted to promote me to the next grade, and I don't think my parents would let them.  I went to, again, a very mixed school.  But this time, there were a lot of Hispanic students there.  And I remember that being different.  I don't really--I mean now when I look back at it I remember, you know, there were black kids and white kids and Hispanic kids.  But I don't think I really realized that being black was different, until one Saturday when I went to--I would go to a dance class with my cousins.  I had cousins who lived in Compton.  And it was an all black dance studio.  And I remember I was painfully shy, and hated dance class (laughter), because they would make you, you know, go across the floor by yourself.  And that just was horrible to me, because I was so shy.
Story_ID: 56835
Speaker 1: But I remember one Saturday going to the dance studio [in Compton, California] and seeing pictures of black people in the South.  And they were at lunch counters, and they had mustard and ketchup thrown on them.  And I think that's when it really hit home that being black in America was different.  It was a challenge.  And I think living on military bases and having my father as an officer in the military had protected me from that somewhat.
Speaker 2: Did you live on a military base when you were in Los Angeles?
Speaker 1: No, no.  And we didn't when I lived in D.C. either, now that I think about it.  But in Compton, you know, I remember it being--and it was, you know, getting to be the middle sixties.  So, there was a lot going on in the world.
Speaker 2: What was going--I mean there was a lot going on in the world.  But how did you perceive what was going on in the world?  What were the things that you found yourself focusing on--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --or drawn to, or influenced by?
Speaker 1: Well, when I look back on that time, the things I remember most are one: you know, seeing the pictures of the African American sit-in protesters, you know, being attacked by throwing condiments on them.  I also remember living in Watts--I mean living in Compton, during the Watts riots.  And Watts was right next door to Compton.  So, I remember for two weeks we couldn't go out of the house, because they were burning Watts and they were burning Compton.  And Compton, downtown Compton, was about a block from my house.  So, I remember my mother [Delma Louise Taylor Lee] wouldn't let us go out of the house.  And I remember we had skateboards, and we really--that was a popular thing to do.  And I wanted to go out and ride my skateboard, but I couldn't.  And I remember, you know, carloads of African American men coming from Watts.  And they had the durags on and, you know, they were throwing Molotov cocktails.  I mean, that's one of my first memories of Los Angeles.  I also remember that President [John F.] Kennedy was shot while I was living in Compton.
Speaker 2: Let's go back to Watts.  Your first memories--did you have any understanding of why people were throwing Molotov cocktails, or--
Speaker 1: Well, I knew they, what that--African Americans were protesting.  I'm not sure I exactly understood what they were protesting.  You know, I knew there were--I don't know how much I knew about segregation or laws, but I knew that it was a time of protest.
Speaker 2: Did your parents [Delma Louise Taylor Lee and Richard McLeish Lee] explain anything to you?
Speaker 1: I think they did.  You know, and I remember seeing signs on businesses in Compton, California saying "Colored Owned" or "Black Owned."  And I knew that was a way that black people were trying to protect their own businesses and their own property.  Because it was clear to me black people were protesting against white people.  And that's what the riots were about, destroying white property, and being angry at white society for the way black people were treated.  I don't remember specifically how my parents explained it to me, but that's how I, you know, what I knew was going on.
Speaker 2: Did you feel any of that when you went to school, in the classrooms, when you were in California?  I mean, because you said, I think you said you went to an integrated school.
Speaker 1: Right.  Yeah, I don't remember feeling, you know, discriminated against or treated differently.  As I said, I was doing well in school.  And, you know, I had friends of different colors.  But I don't remember that there were--it was not a segregated school environment.  It was very integrated, so I remember that part of it.  So, it seemed like this was kind of a different world.  I do remember being at school when I found out that President Kennedy had been shot.  Because for some reason, an airplane was drawing a coffin in the sky.  And I remember we were like, what's going on?  And then I remember our teacher told us that the president had been shot and killed.
Speaker 2: So, you were at school when the news came out?
Speaker 1: Yes, yeah.
Story_ID: 56836
Speaker 1: I remember my cousins were into acting (laughter).  And they did a lot of commercial try-outs.  So, I remember that.  So, you know, the little part of Hollywood was present.  I also had a cousin named Aunt Fishcella.  Her name was Fishcella. (laughter).
Speaker 2: Fish--like "Fishella?"
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think it was F-I-S-H-C-E-L-L-A.  I don't know, "Fishcella."  She was actually married to the trumpet player.  And they moved--they lived in L.A. [Los Angeles, California].  So, I got to know them.  I think he had passed away at that point, but she was still alive.  And she was an extra on one of the soap operas.  So, I remember being very proud of that.  She was so light--you know, she was very light-skinned, so you couldn't tell if she was African American.  But we used to always gather around the TV and be thrilled when she walked through the--you know, she didn't have a speaking part (laughter).  But it was like, "Oh, there's Aunt Fishcella."  (laughter).  So, I remember being a little impressed with Hollywood, even though I didn't really, you know, have a connection.  But my cousins were African American, and they were trying out for pudding commercials and all kind--I remember one of them--one time they all came home vomiting, because they had eaten too much pudding (laughter) at the commercial.  They kept making them do the eating of the pudding over and over again.  So, that's really all I remember about California.  We were only there for two years.
Story_ID: 56837
Speaker 1: Now, at this time, you know, you're little girls, and you have notions of what you want to be when you grow up.  I mean, had you started forming ideas of what you wanted to be when you grew up?
Speaker 2: Not so much at that point, no.  I think that came later when I moved to Greensboro, North Carolina, which is where we moved later.
Speaker 1: So, you leave Los Angeles [California].  Now, is your father [Richard McLeish Lee] in Los Angeles with you at the time?
Speaker 2: He came back from Korea.  Now, he was in Korea while we were--the two years we were in Los Angeles.  And he came back from Korea, and it was right at the tail end of the Watts riots.  And I remember he packed us up and moved us to Greensboro (laughter).  He said it was time to get out of Los Angeles.  And he moved, we moved to Greensboro because his other sister, my other aunt, lived in Greensboro.  And her husband was the coach at [North Carolina] A and T University in Greensboro.  And my dad wanted to finish college.  He never finished college.  And his sister told him that if came to A and T and was a house father, we would get free housing and live in a dorm, and he could finish college for free.  And that's why we moved to Greensboro.
Speaker 1: So, this is Watts riot times.  So, this is what, about 19--
Speaker 2: Let's see.  I was going into sixth grade.  That means I was about twelve [years old].  So, it was about 1965 or '66 [1966].
Speaker 1: So, now at this point and time, had your father then retired from the military?
Speaker 2: Yes, he retired as we were leaving Los Angeles.
Speaker 1: And would you say it was Watts that precipitated the move to North Carolina?
Speaker 2: Well, that, and his getting out of the [U.S.] Army and trying to figure out what he wanted to do with the rest of his life.  I think at the time he could have gone to Vietnam [War] or, you know, retired.  And they promoted him to a major, and he decided it was time to retire.
Story_ID: 56838
Speaker 1: So, let's go to--so, now we're in Greensboro, North Carolina?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And you have been a lot of places, for a young girl.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Germany, Washington [District of Columbia]--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --all these places.
Speaker 2: And had a lot of--well, I guess I shouldn't call it heartbreak--but heartbreak in awhile--hard to make friends for two or three years and then leave them and go to a totally new place and start all over again.
Speaker 1: So, tell us about getting to Greensboro, your first--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: This is at, is this your first time living in the South?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: First impressions, things that you remember when you first get to Greensboro?
Speaker 2: Well, I remember before I even made it to Greensboro, my friends in L.A. [Los Angeles, California] teasing me (laughter), because they said I was moving to the country.  I was like, "What's the country?"  And I know I had started school early.  The schools started in Greensboro like in August.  And I remember my friends in L.A. telling me that was because I had to pick cotton (laughter) in the spring.  So, they wanted to, you know, they wanted--the school system got out early.  I was like, "Oh great.  I'm moving somewhere where I'm going to be picking tobacco."  So, I wasn't thrilled about moving to Greensboro.  But once I got there, I quickly fell in love with it.  I quickly fell in love with it.  It was a wonderful town.  It was very segregated.  It was the most segregated city I'd ever lived in.  It was very clear, the blacks lived on this side of town, and the white folks lived on this side of town.  And the thing that separated them was Market Street.  (laughter).  And we met downtown on Market Street because that's where all the department stores were.  But otherwise, there was no reason for black people to go to the white side of town, and vice versa.  And on the black side of town, we felt like we had everything we needed.  We had black doctors, we had black lawyers, we had a black bank, you know.  The only thing we didn't have were the department stores downtown, which we were allowed to go to.
Story_ID: 56839
Speaker 1: And I went to all black schools [in Greensboro, North Carolina].  I started in the sixth grade, which was the last year of elementary school.
Speaker 2: Do you remember the name of the elementary school?
Speaker 1: Okay, I want to say it was Buford Elementary School.  And then I remember I went to Lincoln Junior High School, which was from seventh to ninth grade.  And then I went to Dudley Senior High School.  And these schools were like right next to other.  You know, it was a little campus in elementary school, junior high, and high school.  But the schools were all black.  The teachers were all black, the students were all black.  And so, my first day in sixth grade, I remember being the, you know, odd girl from L.A. [Los Angeles, California], because no one came in and out of Greensboro.  You just lived there (laughter).  So, the fact that I had moved in, in sixth grade, they were like "Who's this new, you know, weird girl from L.A.?"  But the first day of sixth grade, they elected me president of the class.  And I think because I was the strange girl from L.A. who didn't know any better.  And, you know, I mentioned I was very shy.  And so, it was--it was like I was thrown into a leadership position day one, in this new environment and in this all black environment.  And it really, it changed my life.
Speaker 2: Tell me, what does the sixth grade president of the class do?
Speaker 1: I have, I don't even remember.  (laughter).  I must have done something, but I don't remember.  It may have been more honorary than anything else.
Speaker 2: So, now you're in Greensboro.  You're in an all black environment.  In the past, you've been in a very mixed environment.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 56840
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, we're still in grade school in Greensboro [North Carolina].  You're still in grade school in Greensboro?
Speaker 2: Uh huh.
Speaker 1: And previously, you talked about how you saw a difference in the educational system between Washington, D.C. [District of Columbia] and L.A. [Los Angeles, California].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And now, you're seeing a--we're in the time period of still "separate but equal."
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Are you--tell me about the school.  Did you feel that it was separate and equal?  What was--?
Speaker 2: Well, I felt like the Greensboro schools were a little behind the California schools.  I remember, you know, feeling that math was a step behind where I was.  And so, I felt, you know, I had kind of taken a step back in terms of the school system.  But in terms of the black schools versus the white schools in Greensboro, it was clear we didn't have the same resources as the white schools.  But I think we all felt, students and teachers, that we made up for it because of the love of the teachers, the dedication of the teachers, their inspiration to us, their commitment to the fact that we would do well.  So, if you didn't do well, word of that got home before you did.  They knew our parents, they knew what church we went to.  I mean, it was a very close-knit community.  So, I felt like the education that I received was very good--was, you know, just what I needed to develop myself as an individual and to develop my self-confidence.  I was forced to speak up in class.  I was forced to be a leader in the schools.  And so, I think it all came together for me.  And that's when I really developed my identity and developed a sense of who I was, and what I wanted to be.  So, we actually--when I got to high school, they were trying to integrate the schools.  And it was the first major disagreement I had with my father [Richard McLeish Lee], because my father worked in housing development in Greensboro, and he was one of the parents that was suing the schools to integrate.  And at my school, we were having "Save the Black Schools Day."  We were protesting.  We said, we don't need to integrate, we just need equal resources.  And I think my father saw further ahead and realized that you would never get "separate but equal," that that was impossible.  And, you know, over time I realized that also.  And, but it wasn't until my senior year that the school integrated.  And by integration, I mean they bussed like five white students to my high school.  (laughter)  And that was the first step of integration.  But it was a really turbulent time in Greensboro.  I moved there right after the sit-ins at the Woolworth's [department store].  That had already happened.  But the city, you know, was--talked about that a lot, about how these four students from [North Carolina] A and T [University] had planned this sit-in at the Woolworth's counter.
Speaker 1: And was that the picture you had seen when you were in L.A. when they had thrown the condiments on them?
Speaker 2: It may well have been.  I'm not sure it was that exact counter, but it may well have been.
Story_ID: 56841
Speaker 1: So, when you're going to school in Greensboro [North Carolina]--and as you said, it's a time of unrest.  You had the sit-ins, Woolworth's [department store]--it's the Civil Rights Movement.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: But you're at school, and you're not--I mean, I'm asking you.  You're feeling nurtured and not--this is not impacting you as you're becoming educated?
Speaker 2: The, all the turbulence?
Speaker 1: Uh huh.
Speaker 2: Yes, it was impacting me.  Even though I felt nurtured and protected at school, I was very much aware of what was going on in the world.  [Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.] was killed shortly after I moved to Greensboro.  [Senator] Robert ["Bobby"] Kennedy was killed next.  So, on one hand, I grew up in this age where I thought everyone who was trying to do something good or something great, was murdered for it, you know.  So, that was very disturbing.  There were protests going on in the city.  There were riots at [North Carolina] A and T.  I knew about that.  There were riots at my high school.  I remember my brother, when I was still in junior high school, my brother was in the high school.  I remember him coming to get me one day, because riots had broken out at the high school, and they were using pepper gas.  And he came home to--I mean he came to my junior high school [Lincoln Junior High School], which was just across the street, but to make sure I got home safely.  So, it had very much touched the city and, you know, we knew what was going on.  It was, you know, we were black and we were proud, but it was a very emotional time, you know.  By the time I got to high school, Angela Davis was on the loose.  My dad [Richard McLeish Lee] said I looked just like her, because I had a big Afro (laughter).  You know, we were trying to figure out it meant to be black in America.  So, no, it was very much a part of my everyday life, from junior high on.
Story_ID: 56842
Speaker 1: Let's go to, from grade school to junior high school [in Greensboro, North Carolina].
Speaker 2: Uh huh.
Speaker 1: Do you remember the name of your junior high school?
Speaker 2: Yes, it was Lincoln Junior High School.  It was named after Abraham Lincoln.
Speaker 1: And what were you like when you were in junior high school?
Speaker 2: What was I like?  That's an interesting question.  I think--okay, I've heard my mother [Delma Louise Taylor Lee] say this since when she did a tape at my fiftieth birthday, that I was a little chatterbox, that I used to always get in trouble for talking too much in school.  So, I'd gone from very shy--not that I was completely over that, but I think I tried to compensate for that by talking a lot.  And I think I was very social.  I had two really good friends that I remember well.  I remember being interested in boys, starting in the sixth grade.  I think I went to my first boy/girl party when I was in the sixth grade--and learning how to dance, whether it was by watching Soul Train or stepping on boys' toes (laughter) when we were slow-dancing.  I remember those being very emotionally charged events (laughter).  I remember having my first crush on a guy who was actually shorter than I was.  So, it was hard slow-dancing with him.  But I remember it was a very social environment.  There were parties starting in junior high school.  And, you know, I liked Greensboro.  I liked my school, I liked my teachers.  I was doing well in school.  I was designated as a, you know, good girl, good student.  So, I was expected to do well.  You know, I was still the strange girl from L.A. [Los Angeles, California], but, you know I had begun to blend in.  I was active in student government and, you know, Honor Society and all of those things.  I remember being elected to the Honor Society.  So, it was a great time.
Speaker 1: Did you have a teacher or mentor that inspired you when you were in middle school?
Speaker 2: Not that I recall.  I remember more about my teachers in high school.  But I think as a general rule, you know, I liked all my teachers.
Story_ID: 56843
Speaker 1: What kind of music were you listening to?
Speaker 2: Oh, it was definitely the age of Motown.  And you know, also by the time I got to high school, you know, funk--the Funkadelics, Ohio Players.  Greensboro was a very musical city.  You know, it was just--Motown was becoming very hot and, you know, we were always thrilled to see the Supremes on Ed Sullivan or the Temptations on Ed Sullivan.  I remember when the Beatles became popular.  But it was very black-music heavy, whether it was Motown or whether it was, you know, the music from Memphis [Tenenssee] or--.  But it was always about the music.  And that was a big influence in my life.  I remember I had a little tiny 45 turntable in my little room.  And you know, I remember buying my 45s and being excited.  The Supremes and the Temptations were my idols.  You know, I wanted to grow up and be glamorous like Diana Ross.  And so, it was a great time.  And I remember Don Cornelius, you know, just passed away a few weeks ago, and thinking how important that was in my life.  Every Saturday morning I'd get up and do all my chores quickly, so I could watch Soul Train and see what the latest dances were, the latest fashion.  You know, that was one hour a week that connected African Americans all over the country, and how important that was to see the Afro Sheen commercials and to see the different dance steps.  And, you know, to have that hour.  Because there still weren't enough of us on TV, whether it was the show Julia--I remember that being (laughter) one of the first shows I saw that had an African American female lead.  Or, when, you know, the Jackson Five or someone were on Ed Sullivan, it was still big news.  You know, there weren't that many of us.  Flip Wilson had a show.  But TV was very important in my household, and we didn't have very many of them back then, but I remember they were always on.  So, anytime, you know, someone black came on the TV, it was, it was cause to pick up the phone and call others, and to celebrate.  But the music was important during that time.
Story_ID: 56844
Speaker 1: Now, at that time are you beginning to think about what you want to do in life, or the things that interest you the most?
Speaker 2: Yes.  And from an early age, my aunt who lived in Washington [District of Columbia] was an influence.  She had two sons.
Speaker 1: What was her name, again?
Speaker 2: Her name was Laura Lee Spencer.  And she was an attorney, and she went to Mount Holyoke [College].  And because she had two sons, she wanted me to go to Mount Holyoke, because they couldn't go.  And so, from a very early age, she used to give me books about Mary Lyons [Lyon], I think her name was, L-Y-O-N-S, the founder of Mount Holyoke.  And she was a role model.  And I also realized during that time, that my dad [Richard McLeish Lee] always wanted to be a lawyer.  He's very, he had handled a few legal trials when he was in the military [U.S. Army].  Not that he was a lawyer, but somehow they let him do that.  And he always wanted to be a lawyer.  So, all that to say from a very age, I thought I wanted to be a lawyer.  And I saw the influence that Thurgood Marshall, Constance Baker Motley--you know, a lot of the agents for change in the civil rights eras, were lawyers.  And so, I grew up believing that if you wanted to change the world, the best way to do it was to become a lawyer.  So, I thought early on that I wanted to be a lawyer.  Now, I wasn't sure how much of that was me, and how much of that was my father and my aunt (laughter).  But somehow it kinda all worked together.  Then when I got to high school, I really found I enjoyed journalism.  There was--I wrote for the yearbook, I wrote for the school paper.  There was a local black newspaper called the 'Carolina Peacemaker'.  And I had a weekly column in that called the 'Dudley Scene', where I would write about what was going on at the high school.  So, by the time I had graduated from high school, I also had an interest in journalism.
Story_ID: 56845
Speaker 1: So, well let's--I think we can go to high school now.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Dunbar High School [Greensboro, North Carolina].  Tell us--right?  Was it--no, that was your father's [Richard McLeish Lee] school.
Speaker 2: That was my father's school.
Speaker 1: Your father's school was Dunbar, I'm sorry.  Yours is Dudley.
Speaker 2: Dudley, James D. Dudley High School.
Speaker 1: And do you know who James D. Dudley was?
Speaker 2: He was some African American who had done something in Greensboro, but I don't know very much about him.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, tell me about high school.  You have, now you've been class president--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --when you're in sixth grade.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: You've done great in middle school--
Speaker 2: Uh huh.
Speaker 1: And now you hit high school.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And this is, what year would this be?
Speaker 2: Would have been 1969.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I graduated high school in 1972.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And in high school, I remember it being fun.  You know, it was a lot of hard work.  I remember there were, you know, difficult courses.  But I, again, I, you know, I was a good student.  I was in, there was a group of us that were kind of the good students.  And I would not say I was at the top of the class by any stretch of the imagination.  There were more brainiac type students who did much better than I did.  But I was smart and--but I always wanted to be normal at the same time.  So, I wanted to have fun and have a social life.  So, I wasn't the kind of student that was going to study all the time.  But I did really well.  And because I was, had not lived in Greensboro all my life, I knew more about the rest of the country than most of my counterparts did in high school.  So, I always had, you know, my sights set on going away to college.  But Dudley High, again, was very proud of its history.  We had what we thought were several stars who had gone to Dudley--Curly Neal who played for the Harlem Globetrotters (laughter).  That's why I said it's our version of stars.  You know, a couple of pro football players had gone to Dudley.  Again, we were proud of the history.  We were proud of the teachers.  They took their work very seriously.  And, again, I was active in a lot of different organizations.  I was always a multi-tasker.  I always did a lot of different things.
Speaker 1: What were some of the activities that you were involved in?
Speaker 2: Well, I was in the Honor Society.  I was a Pantherette.  We danced at the--
Speaker 1: A Panther I assume is the--
Speaker 2: A Panther--
Speaker 1: --mascot of the school?
Speaker 2: Yes, the Dudley High Panthers.  And the dance team was called the Pantherettes.  So, we danced at football games.  So, I wasn't a majorette, I couldn't twirl.  And I wasn't a cheerleader because I couldn't do a cartwheel, but I was a Pantherette.  And so, we would march with the band if they performed in parades.  And we would do the half-time shows, which was a lot of fun.  Which meant after school everyday I had band practice, because we practiced with the band.  And so, that was fun.  I worked on the yearbook staff.
Story_ID: 56846
Speaker 1: I also had a part-time job during high school [James D. Dudley High School, Greensboro, North Carolina].  First, I was a candy striper.  That was my--well, no, before that I was always (laughter) very entrepreneurial, and I always liked making money.  So, I think my first job, going back to Washington, D.C. [District of Columbia], my mother [Delma Louise Taylor Lee] taught me how to make potholders.  So, I used to make potholders, you know, on the looms.  And I used to go door to door to sell the potholders.  So, that was my first real job that I remember, you know, my first way to make money.  Then when I was in Greensboro, I think the first--the next job I had, a girlfriend and I created what we call the Benbow Park Party Agency.
Speaker 2: Benbow?
Speaker 1: Benbow Park.  We lived--
Speaker 2: Can you spell that one, too?
Speaker 1: B-E-N-B-O-W.  And Benbow Park was a black housing development.  It was a very, you know, middle-class to upper class housing development in Greensboro.  And I heard the story years later when I went back to speak at the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] Annual Dinner after I'd been president, you know, of BET [Black Entertainment Television] for years.  But the story was, there's this white developer who thought there should be a very nice housing development on the black side of town, which was unusual in those days.  But he built this very upscale neighborhood.  And the houses were made of brick and they were beautiful, and the lawns were big.  And it was called Benbow Park, and that's where I lived.  Now, I sort of remember my father [Richard McLeash Lee] saying we had the cheapest house in Benbow Park.  (laughter)  But there were a lot of doctors and lawyers who lived in the neighborhood who had much bigger houses.  But it was a really nice neighborhood and a nice place to grow up.  So, my girlfriend lived across the street, and her father was a dentist.  He was actually my dentist.  And her parents and my parents [Demla Louise Taylor Lee and Richard McLeash Lee] were best friends.  And we started Benbow Park Party Agency, which we would go around and plan birthday parties for mothers who wanted to have parties for their kids.  And we used to come up with a theme, and we'd do the invitations and we would plan the games.  And so, we have this nice little business where we would go around and plan birthday parties.  Then we had some sort of--I remember we had a, did some sort of telephone thing.  She lived right across the street, and we had a way that we could talk to each other.  We were always inventing things.  And then--
Speaker 2: About how old were you when you were doing your Benbow parties?
Speaker 1: I think I was tenth, eleventh grade.  And then I want to say eleventh grade maybe I became a candy striper.  There was a black hospital right down the street from where I lived.  It was in Benbow Park.  And so, I was a candy striper.  And then when I was a senior in high school, I got a job at Belk Department Store, which was downtown.
Speaker 2: Now, is this the white department store?
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was a white department store.
Speaker 2: So, they were hiring African Americans at that point and time?
Speaker 1: Yes, they were.  And not a lot of us.  And it was funny.  I went to apply for the job, and I got a job in the jewelry department.  And so, I sold jewelry.  And I remember I was right across the aisle from a woman who was very dark-skinned who sold Fashion Fair (laughter) Cosmetics.  I remember she had the biggest eyelashes ever.  I can't remember what her name was.  I want to say Flo or something like that, but she was beautiful.  She wore her hair in a bun, and she had on all this makeup and these big eyelashes.  So, she worked there.  But the thing--what they said to me when they hired me--because when I went for the interview I had this gigantic Afro.  And the person that hired me said, "You know, we'd like to offer you a position in our jewelry department."  He said, "But can you wear your hair a different way?"  And I knew exactly what that meant.  You know, he wanted me to straighten my hair, so maybe people wouldn't notice as quickly that I was African American.  And, you know, I went home and straightened my hair, (laughter) because I really wanted that job.  And that was probably 1971, 1972.  And I don't remember there being a lot of other African Americans working at the store.  There was the Fashion Fair saleswoman, who must have been hired by Ebony and Fashion Fair.  And then there was me.  I don't remember anyone else being there.  But that was kind of my first job downtown (laughter).  And you could say my first real job.
Story_ID: 56847
Speaker 1: Now, in high school [James D. Dudley High School, Greensboro, North Carolina]--
Speaker 2: Uh huh?
Speaker 1: There's a famous person from your school, Claude Barnes.  Do you remember the name Claude Barnes?  Ran for student president and they wouldn't allow him to be the student body president.
Speaker 2: It does ring a bell.
Speaker 1: I want, I'm going to take you to it.  It's May, 1969, I believe, and it's at your high school.  And I want to talk first of all just a little bit about the culture of the school, in terms of--was it strict disciplinarian, dress code, things like that?  We'll come back to Claude Brown and--
Speaker 2: Okay.  Was it Brown or Barnes?
Speaker 1: Barnes, I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Claude Barnes.
Speaker 2: So, the environment, I would say it was primarily conservative.  You know, African Americans were pretty conservative at that time.  Our teachers wanted us to do well.  So, you know, mannerisms, dress, all of that was an important part of it.  It was the black power days, so, you know, there was a lot of big Afros, and that was allowed.  But I do remember--I think this was in junior high school [Lincoln Junior High School, Greensboro].  The principal insisted that if we knelt on the ground, that our dress had to touch the ground.  (laughter).  That was his rule.  And I think there was some other rule in high school.  But there wasn't a lot of wearing of pants.  Even though I remember I had some hot pants at one point.  And I don't know if I wore those to school.  I know there was a picture of me--and our school colors were blue and gold, and I had a blue and gold hot pants set (laughter).  So, it may have been at a party that the picture was taken, but I know it was in the yearbook.  But the school was pretty strict.  And as I said before, if we were in trouble, the word about trouble got home before we did.  If I was walking home which sometimes I did, holding my boyfriend's hand, word of that would get home before I did.  So, you know, it was the village.  Everyone felt responsible for everyone else's kids.  So, if Mrs. Smith looked out the window and saw you doing something on the way home, she would call, you know, your parents in a minute.  So, there was this very high expectation that you would do right, you would study hard, and you would behave yourself.  And that was the norm, and what they expected.  Now, that doesn't mean we all did that. (laughter).  There was lots of mischief behind the scenes.  I remember going to school events dressing one way and having, you know, my hot pants in the bag, and changing after I got through with the school event.  So, we would go over to [North Carolina] A and T [University] and hang out.  That was our big thing, you know.  We thought when we were in high school we were grown and we could go see Funkadelic over at A and T.  So, you know, there was a lot of mischief behind the scenes.  But our parents expected us to do right, as our teachers did, our ministers, you know.  The churches were a big part of the community.  And everyone knew who you were.  So, you know, if you got into trouble, everyone knew about it.  So, you tried (laughter), you tried not to do that.
Speaker 1: And getting into trouble was, you know, holding your boyfriend's hand when he's walking--
Speaker 2: Yeah, holding my boyfriend's hand, being caught kissing at a basement party--or, you know, very rare, very seldom--but there was some teenage pregnancy, I remember at my school.  But those girls were sent away for nine months, and then miraculously they came back.  Or, I think there may have been an after-school program for pregnant girls.  But, you know, that was getting into trouble if you, you know, somehow got pregnant in high school.  Drugs were a little bit around, but not a big problem, but they were around.  Drinking, you know--.  So, I remember, you know, it was always a concern at proms and things like that about drinking--mostly about drinking, you know.
Story_ID: 56848
Speaker 1: This is the time of black power--
Speaker 2: Uh huh.
Speaker 1: --and Claude Barnes, from the research, is a student who ran for class president.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: He wanted to--and you may not remember this, but they wouldn't allow him on the ballot because he was too radical.  Do you remember the protest at your school [James D. Dudley High School, Greensboro, North Carolina] during that time?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I certainly do, right.  I hadn't heard that name in a long time.
Speaker 1: And [North Carolina] A and T [University] was involved in the protest.
Speaker 2: Right.  That was the riot I was talking about.
Speaker 1: Yes, can you tell us a little bit more about the riot?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  All I remember is some A and T students--something had happened at A and T a couple of days before.  And I don't remember what they were protesting, but they were mad about something at A and T, and they had a mini riot over there.  And a friend of mine was arrested, a guy named Tyrone Evans, who lived down the street from me.  His younger brother was actually Vince Evans, who went on to USC [University of Southern California].
Speaker 1: The football player?
Speaker 2: Yeah, (laughter) who I still see.  But this was his older brother, and he was arrested.  And then I remember it came, the protest came over to Dudley, for some reason.  And I don't remember what it was about, but the story you're telling me sounds vaguely familiar.
Speaker 1: Did you, were you active in protests at that time?
Speaker 2: The only one I remember--I think during that time, I was still at the junior high school [Lincoln Junior High School, Greensboro].  Yeah, I think I started high school--I graduated in '79 [1979].  And high school then was tenth, eleventh, and twelfth [grades].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, I was still at Lincoln.
Story_ID: 56849
Speaker 1: And when I did get to high school [James D. Dudley High School, Greensboro, North Carolina], I do remember participating in "Save the Black School Days."  I do remember taking over a few parent/teacher meetings, you know.
Speaker 2: Well, tell us a little bit about that.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I just--
Speaker 2: Taking over the parent/teacher's meeting--
Speaker 1: I know--
Speaker 2: --in the context of having to be a good girl (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yeah.  I just remember my friends and I--and you know, I can't remember how many--maybe about ten of us, were protesting something.  I remember us marching down the aisle in the middle of this PTA [Parent Teacher Association] meeting, and taking over.  I remember my father's [Richard McLeash Lee] face.  (laughter).  My father was very strict.  So, the biggest fear of my life in high school was making my father mad.  And I never wanted to do that.  And I remember that night him giving me that look.  My father had a temper, so when you made him mad, you were in trouble.  I remember there was a place in the black shopping center called Gilford Dairy Bar where all the kids used to hang out, especially on Sunday afternoons.  So, people would drive their cars there, and the boys would talk to the girls and, you know, vice versa.  But it was like a hangout spot.  I remember my father used to say, "I never want to see you up at Gilford Dairy Bar."  (laughter).  And I remember his car coming through and I'd be in someone's car.  And I have to duck, you know, (laughter) because I didn't want him to catch me at Gilford Dairy Bar.  But my father was a very strict disciplinarian.  And not so much with me, because he didn't know (laughter) what I was doing.  But my brother would get into trouble a lot.  And I remember my father used to make him do some really awful things that would upset him.  Like once he wouldn't get his hair cut.  And my father made him take a sign up to the black golf course and walk up and down saying, you know, with the sign, saying, "I will not get my hair--", something, I don't know.  He used to play a lot of mental games with my brother.  He must have learned those in the military [U.S. Army]. (laughter).  So anyway, needless to say, I tried to be very good, because I didn't want to get into trouble.  But I do remember the protests.  I remember Save the Black School Day.  Because I remember, you know, going to college and telling people about Save the Black School Day.  And they'd just look at me like it was the weirdest thing they'd ever heard.
Speaker 2: Tell us about Save the Black School Day.  When was this, and what was your objective?
Speaker 1: It was either '71 [1971] or '72 [1972].  And our objective was to stop integration from coming to our school.  Now, Greensboro early on had freedom of choice, which in Greensboro terms meant if black students wanted to go to a white school, you could apply.  And a couple of students a year would be allowed into the white school.  That was called freedom of choice.
Speaker 2: Now, this is pre--when is this freedom of choice program going on?
Speaker 1: I think it started in the late sixties.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So, when you were in high school, you had freedom of choice?
Speaker 1: Right.  If I had wanted to go--there were three white high schools in Greensboro--one black high school, and three white schools.  So, if I had wanted to go to one of the white high schools I could have applied, and they may have accepted me.  So, you know, those students were very brave because one: they were in these, you know, sometimes hostile environments.  But it wasn't forced busing.  It was what we called freedom of choice.  So, I had some friends who, you know, wanted to go to white schools.  But the students who went to Dudley wanted to go to Dudley.  And so, when there was talk of forced busing--to force students from Dudley to go to other schools and to force white students to come to Dudley--that's when we had the Save the Black School protests.
Story_ID: 56850
Speaker 1: Now, we're going to come back to saving the black schools.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Your father [Richard McLeish Lee] had previously sued Greensboro [North Carolina] schools--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --for integration.
Speaker 2: Yes, he was one of the plaintiffs.
Speaker 1: In the original case?
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Brown v. Topeka Kansas, or not?
Speaker 2: No, I don't think it was that one.  It was another one.
Speaker 1: But he--okay, but he sued.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he sued on the local level.  One of his very good friends was a guy named Dr. George Simkins, who was the local dentist.  But he was also the head of the local NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], and he had asked my father to be one of the group of parents to sue.
Speaker 1: So, in the context of your father suing, and you having "Save the Black School Day" [at James D. Dudley High School]--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So, talk a little bit more about that.
Speaker 2: Well, it was really the first time I publicly, you know, disagreed with my father, which was a very big thing to me.  And he wasn't happy about it, but I think it was part of my growing up and starting to think for myself.  And I think years later, I realized that his approach was probably best, especially when you look back at the history of Brown v. Board of Education, and you look at what our president has accomplished.  You know, we probably could have never gotten there with "separate but equal."  But at the time, you couldn't have told me that.
Speaker 1: So, what did you guys do?  Did you, I mean were you active, were you with signs?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we had signs.  You know, we were marching in front of the school.  I'm not sure, I think we got some local press coverage.  But I think it went to more that we were proud of our school, and we loved our teachers and thought we were doing well.  And I remember we didn't have running water in our science lab.  But I think we used that as a way to learn how to do things without water.  I mean, you know, it was a challenge to us, to show that we were as smart as the white students across town, even though we didn't have the same resources.  And that's a lesson that has stayed with me all my life, that, you know, you have to prove--as an African American, you have to prove yourself smarter than, you have to work harder, but that we can really do it.  And when you do it, you take a lot of pride in it.  And I use that lesson to this day at BET [Black Entertainment Television] every day.

Speaker 1: So, your senior year [at James D. Dudley High School, Greensboro, North Carolina] rolls around?
Speaker 2: Uh huh.
Speaker 1: And they're integrating the school.  Is that correct?
Speaker 2: Yes.  That happened in my senior year, yes.
Speaker 1: So, tell us how that goes.  "Save the Black School" fails.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it didn't work (laughter).  And they integrated.  They did forced busing, and they--you know, it was just a handful of white students that came to Dudley, and a handful of white teachers.  But I remember I got my worst grade from one of the white teachers, my first bad grade ever.  I can't remember what the course was, but it was senior year.  I remember I was applying to colleges, trying to figure out where I was going to go.  I remember there was a white guidance counselor all of a sudden who thought I should go to American University, which my father [Richard McLeash Lee] was very upset about.  My father wanted me to go to an Ivy League school.  And so, I remember not being able to get the best college advice, probably because of the result of integration.  I remember, you know, I had a strong record.  And I applied to three colleges.  That's all I remember.  And I applied to Cornell [University], because my cousin went there.  I applied to--
Speaker 1: Is that Michael Spencer?
Speaker 2: Yes.  He's the son of the aunt I was talking about.  You know, Laura Lee Spencer is his mother.  And I applied to Brown [University], because three students from Brown came to visit Dudley High, and they had great Afros (laughter) that impressed me.  And I applied to Yale [University] because they were just starting to accept women, and my father thought it would be cute if I went there.  And those were the three schools I applied to.  So, I remember senior year being turbulent, because of the change.  And, but I also remember being very focused on, in my mind, getting away from Greensboro.  I felt it was time to leave.  And it was a very insular community.  You know, a lot of my high school class went to [North Carolina] A & T [State University].  I always say if you were really smart, you went to [University of North Carolina] Chapel Hill [Chapel Hill, North Carolina].  And if you were brilliant, you went to Duke [University].  And that was the world.  A few black students would go to Howard [University], and that was as far north as students went.  But no one had ever heard of Brown.  And when I started talking about going to Ivy League schools, they were sure I was strange at that point (laughter).  It wasn't something that was acceptable in Greensboro.
Speaker 1: So, you did not consider any of the traditional southern schools to go to?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: You wanted to come back North.
Speaker 2: Right.
Story_ID: 56852
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, now-Cornell [University], Brown [University], Yale [University].
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Cornell, my alma mater, you didn't choose it.
Speaker 2: I did not.  Do you want to know why?  (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Because I went to visit my cousin [Michael Spencer].  I flew up to Ithaca, or Syracuse--or whatever the closest airport.  He picked me up, and I was up there during spring break, when the only students that were there, were the ones who were failing, because they have to go before the disciplinary board (laughter).  He also showed me something called the gorge, and told me that there was a verb called gorging for kids who wanted to commit suicide.  So, between that and the weather, I quickly decided Cornell was not for me.  I left there and went to visit Brown, which I really loved.  The student body was great, they had great parties--all the things you care about (laughter) when you're applying to college.  And then I didn't get into Yale.  So, that turned out not to be a choice.  I didn't even go there to visit.  My dad [Richard McLeash Lee] said that when you go from Providence [Rhode Island] to New York--because my sister was in New York--look out the window when you pass through New Haven [Connecticut] (laughter), and see if you can see Yale.  So, that was my college experience.
Speaker 1: So, you're leaving high school [James D. Dudley High School, Greensboro, North Carolina], and they're integrating.  And you're saying it's now time to go.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: I love my black high school, but time to go off to an Ivy League school.
Speaker 2: Yes, predominantly white school.
Speaker 1: Predominantly white Ivy League school--
Speaker 2: In the North.
Speaker 1: --in the North.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And in a fairly--is that in Providence?
Speaker 2: Yes, which they told me at the time was the second largest city in New England, which I didn't know.  It didn't mean anything, but (laughter) I thought I was going to a fairly big city.
Speaker 1: So, the year is 19-
Speaker 2: '72 [1972].
Speaker 1: 1972.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, Debra Lee is entering Brown.  Now, have you formed any ideas of what you want to study at Brown, and why you are there?
Speaker 2: I thought I wanted to study journalism, and then I got to Brown and realized they didn't have a journalism department.  (laughter)  So, that was bad planning on my part.  But I still had the thought that I would probably go to law school, in the back of my mind.  So, I studied political science.  And the thing I liked about Brown was that it had what they called the new curriculum, where you could, you know, map your own course of study.  And so, there were no requirements.  I didn't have to take foreign language, which I hated in high school.  I took French, and I was never good at French.  And so, I was really glad I didn't have to take a foreign language.  But I got to Brown.  By this point, my Afro was a little shorter.  It was short cropped, but I still had it.  And it was the early seventies, so still a very militant time.  So, I started taking a lot of Chinese Communist ideology courses (laughter).  So, you know, I was always a little militant.  And, but I was a little nervous about going to a predominantly white school.  In the back of my mind, I felt like I was prepared, that I had really good reading and writing skills.  But I went to the school and, you know, all these white students show up with computer printouts.  I'd never even seen a computer printout.  And I find that they were going to [Phillips] Exeter [Academy], you know, and all these fancy prep schools that I never heard about.  So, there was a little period of unease, and questioning whether I was going to be able to make it.  And, but early on with the first papers I turned in, the first test I took, I did well.  And so, early on I became more comfortable, and knew I could do it.  As I said, I think I had a lot of self-esteem from high school.  And, you know, it was a scary thing, because I didn't know anyone else at Brown.  The first day there, I met my best friend, who's still my best friend.
Speaker 1: Who is?
Speaker 2: Her name is Michelle Born.  She was from New York.  People thought we were twins.  She looks, or did look, a lot like me.
Story_ID: 56853
Speaker 1: How did you get there?  Did you drive?  Did your parents [Delma Louise Taylor Lee and Richard McLeash Lee] drive you up there?  Did you fly?
Speaker 2: [I'm sorry, I have to do this.]  How did I get to Brown [University, Providence, Rhode Island]?  I took the bus from--by this point, my parents had separated, or divorced.  My parents separated my senior year in high school [James D. Dudley High School, Greensboro, North Carolina].  And that was, that was, had a big impact on me.  And my dad moved to Washington, D.C. [District of Columbia], which is where he was from.  So, when it was time for me to go to college, I took the bus to Washington to meet him, and then he drove me from Washington to Providence [Rhode Island], yeah.  And that's how I got to Brown.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And at Brown--at that time, a lot of the schools had de facto segregated kind of housing for students.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: They put black students with black students and white--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Did Brown do that?
Speaker 2: No, there was no per se black housing at Brown.  But I would say the student body, the freshman class, and all through Brown, was still very segregated.  I mean, my friends were black.  We sat together in the cafeteria.  We refused to bus our trays, because we said after two hundred years of slavery, that black students should not be forced to bus their trays.  And it's hard to even fix my mouth to say this now.  But we would leave them there, very seriously.  (laughter)  So, for four years at Brown, I never bust my tray, which made it hard for the black people who--the black students who worked in the cafeteria, because they had to bust the trays.  We never thought of that.  But you know--so, where the black students sat, by the end of the lunch hour or dinner hour, there were like, you know, trays stacked on top of each other.  It was the most ridiculous thing.  But anyway that just shows you--
Speaker 1: How many African American students were at Brown at that time?
Speaker 2: There were actually about five hundred out of a student body size of five thousand.  So, it was about 10 percent black.  They were very proud of the fact that they recruited heavily and, you know, that's why those three black students came to Dudley High.  But, you know, the black students pretty much hung together.  And if you didn't hang together, you were labeled as a person who didn't hang, for lack of a better word.  You had to really make a choice--either I'm going to hang out with the white students, or I'm going to hang out with the black students.  Very few people went back and forth.  I think the only people who went back and forth successfully were athletes, you know.  They could play on the football team and have white friends, or the basketball team, and have white friends, and go back and forth.  But everyone else, it was clear early on, you had to make a choice.  And, you know, in retrospect that was really odd.  And in fact, I remember my sister came to visit once--and I think for Parents' Weekend, she came with my mother.  And, you know, we, all the black students sat together at the football game, we had black parties.  And I remember at the end of the weekend, she said, "Why didn't you just go to Howard [University]?"  (laughter).  "You know, why did you go to the trouble of coming to Brown, if you're not going to, you know, socialize with white students?"  But that's the way it was in the '70s [1970s], you know, these Ivy League schools and white schools had just began to accept a good number of black students.  And I think the black students felt that in order to make it, they had to hang together.  And we had deans who, you know, we talked to, and you know, you dealt with their professors.  But a lot of times, you could sit in those big lecture halls, and never know your professor--you know, just do your work and keep it moving.  So, it was an interesting environment, but I really loved Brown.
Story_ID: 56854
Speaker 1: I found students [at Brown University] who were a lot like me.  You know, one of the challenges of going to Dudley High [School, Greensboro, North Carolina] was, being a good student, you were kind of pegged as a good student.  And, but you still had to be normal at the same time, and that created some controversy.  When I got to Brown I felt, found, other black students who were smart and who thought that that was normal--that you didn't have to, you know, be militant or be, you know, something that you weren't just to try to fit in with students who weren't smart.  So, I found a lot of students at Brown that came from backgrounds like mine.  As I said, I met my best friend [Michelle Born] the first day of freshman week, and we've been friends ever since.  I liked the course of study.  I was able to be very independent, and decide what I wanted to study.  And I ended up going to Southeast Asia my junior year, because I liked Asian studies so much.  And I was able to really find out what I liked and what I didn't like when I was at Brown.  I think one of the things I wasn't prepared for was the discrimination, and just hatred, that I found in Providence [Rhode Island], the city. And then later, that I found in Boston [Massachusetts], the city, when I went to law school.  You know, even having grown up in the South, you knew where you were supposed to be and where you weren't supposed to be.  But there wasn't this feeling of, you know, I'm being discriminated against because I'm black, because you didn't put yourself in those environments.  I remember trying to get a job, maybe my sophomore year at Brown, and knowing that they weren't hiring me, because I was black--and realizing that that felt very different.
Speaker 2: Now, when you were at Brown, was Walter Massey [also a HistoryMaker; ScienceMaker] there?
Speaker 1: Yes, he was the dean there.
Speaker 2: Oh, so, he was dean while you were at Brown?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: And did you interact with Walter Massey?
Speaker 1: Yes, not a whole lot, because he was in the engineering school and, you know, I stayed away from the sciences.  But I knew who he was, and he knew me.  And, you know, later in life we'd become better friends.  But I knew him, I knew his wife.  You know, Brown was a small community.  And the black deans, whether they were in your department or not, were always there to be helpful.  So, I did know him.
Story_ID: 56855
Speaker 1: So, let's talk about your intellectual development while you were at Brown [University].  You talked a little bit about studying communist philosophy, because you were sort of feeling militant.
Speaker 2: Militant, right.
Speaker 1: So, tell us how that philosophy grows into you actually ending up going to Southeast Asia.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Well, it was interesting because, as I said, I was in political science.  And the two things I gravitated toward--and maybe this is the conflict of my life, (laughter) was the Chinese Communist ideology courses.  And then there was another professor who used to be in the CIA [Central Intelligence Agency] and taught a lot of courses on weaponry and wars, and I took a lot of his courses.  So, I don't know if that was my dad's [Rochard McLeash Lee] military [U.S. Army] background that attracted me, but those were kind of the two things I focused on.  Then I tried to take some Afro Am [African American] courses, as we called it, until my father called and said, "Okay, you've taken enough of those (laughter).  If you haven't found out your identity now, you know, I'm not paying for any more of it."  So, my father was very much involved in the courses I chose.  Not that I listened to him, but he was, he was a very smart man.  And he would just get a hold of a Brown catalog, course catalog, and give me suggestions, you know.  I remember at one point he said, "Well, you should think about majoring in geology.  There are not a lot of black geologists."  Or, "You should major in the Chinese language, because China's going to open up soon.  And, you know, if you know how to speak Chinese--."
Speaker 1: Your father was saying this to you back in the '70s [1970s]--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: --about China?
Speaker 2: Right, yeah.  And so, I kind of half listened and, you know, pooh-poohed it.  But he was, he was always very smart, very well-read, very proud of the fact that I went to Brown.  And you know, he wanted to be a part of that experience.  My mother [Delma Louise Taylor Lee] on the other hand was very nurturing and, you know, wasn't pushy in terms of you have to do well.  And you know, my father was, "Oh, you have to do well."  But she was always just there in case I didn't do well, to comfort me (laughter).  She didn't know very much about Ivy League schools.  She had only gone to, she went to Tennessee State [University, Nashville, Tennessee] for maybe a year or two.  She never finished college.  And she wasn't as well-read as my father, but she was--she had more common sense and was more, I think on the creative side.  But Brown--you know, in sum, Brown turned out to be a great environment for me.  I could study at my own pace, I could pick my own courses, and I was independent enough and knowledgeable enough to do it.  You know, even though I didn't have to take certain courses, I ended up taking them anyway, just so I was a well-rounded person.  And, you know, I was pretty sure when it was all said and done, I would go to law school.
Story_ID: 56856
Speaker 1: So, I'm fascinated about--it's during the Black Power period.  And you're now, you're focusing on the Chinese studies, which is--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --you know, very interesting.  Tell me a little bit about--you're overseas now, it's your junior year.  Where are you during your Asian studies?
Speaker 2: I was in Thailand for about six weeks.  We, I went over, it was the University of Hawaii program.  But Brown would give me, gave me credit for a semester.  So, the University of Hawaii took about twenty of us over to Southeast Asia.  And China was still closed at that time.  Because I went to my dean and said, "I want to go to China."  And he said, "You can't go to China, they're not letting Americans in."  He said, "The closest you can get is Southeast Asia."  So, I said "Okay, you know, that sounds good."  So, there's only one other Brown student on the trip with me.  But we went to a university in southern Thailand, and we studied there for six weeks.  We took language, so I ended up taking language anyway.  I took Malay, because I was going to go to Indonesia to study.  And we took history and other courses.  But they kind of plopped us in the middle of this university where they hadn't seen American students before.  And it was very Third World-ish.  And that's why, that's the part of the Chinese, the Communist ideology that appealed to me, this thought that there was a Third World vision and that, you know, black Americans were a lot like Asians, you know, Africans and people in the Third World and emerging countries that were oppressed.  You know, so, there was a lot of that going on.  So, you know, it's really a great learning experience.  One: to get over there, to find out that they didn't share the same view of the world.  They weren't thinking in terms of Third World, they were thinking in terms of, you know, how do we make it until next week?  You know, how do we prevent a--I was over there in the middle of the Vietnam War, and, you know, Thailand and Indonesia, they were all along that same part of the world.  So, they were concerned about, you know, making it from day to day.  They weren't saying, "Oh, we're a lot like black Americans."  You know, welcome you with--.  You know, they used to stare at me a lot, because by that time my hair had gotten longer again.  I used to go in some villages, and the whole village would stop because, you know, I had this hair.  I kind of looked like them in a way, you know--my skin tone and my features.  So, if I didn't have all this, you know, this big Afro, I could have passed.  Sometimes to get across the borders in different countries, I would put on a scarf, because they also sometimes associated big Afros with drug trades.  So, they thought I was, you know--sometimes it would be hard to get from country to country, looking more militant than I actually was.  But it was a great learning experience, and a great--
Speaker 1: How long were you there?
Speaker 2: I was there about six months.  And it took me out of that, you know, protective Brown environment and taught me how to travel by myself, taught me how to think by myself, taught me how to, you know, make do.  The second part of the study, I traveled by myself.  I went to Indonesia and studied with a national oil company.
Speaker 1: An American oil company, or Indonesian?
Speaker 2: Indonesian oil company.  And I, it was something my father [Richard McLeash Lee] actually hooked up for me through this friend of his.  By this time, he was in Washington [District of Columbia].  He was still doing community development work, but he worked with this guy who I later found out was in the CIA [Central Intelligence Agency].  But he hooked me up to study with this oil company, and I stayed with an attache' family in Jakarta [Indonesia].  And every week they would travel, you know, sending me around in private planes to show me all their community development projects.  The theory of my thesis was that a national oil company would do more for the community than American companies, who would come in, take the oil and not give back in any way.  So, this national, this Indonesian oil company was very happy to show me all the good stuff they were doing in their communities, and how they were better than Shell and Exxon.
Speaker 1: And was this all being conducted in--did they all speak English, or were you learning the Indonesian language?
Speaker 2: A little bit of both.  I mean I wasn't proficient enough in the language to talk too long.  But when I was traveling by myself, a lot of times I had to depend on my language.
Speaker 1: So, what did that feel like then?  I mean, to--in your head are you feeling like, "I'm grown up now?"  Or, "I'm growing up now?"  What--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I felt like it was--again, it was part of my, you know, growing up being independent.  My parents [Richard McLeash lee and Delma Louise Taylor Lee] weren't thrilled about me going overseas.  And now that I have kids, I'm not sure I would have let them go over,  (laughter), you know, in the middle of a war to travel around Southeast Asia.  But I proved to my father that, you know, I could do it for less than a semester at Brown costs, so it wasn't costing him any more.  It was, you know, I was going to get full credit.  So, they finally agreed to let me go.  But it was a pretty aggressive thing for someone of my age to do.
Story_ID: 56857
Speaker 1: So you're in Indonesia, in fact, in Southeast Asia [on a study-abroad program while lee was a junior at Brown University]?
Speaker 2: Uh huh.
Speaker 1: And your thesis is on, you know, basically the Indonesians having their own companies.
Speaker 2: Yes, owning their own companies.
Speaker 1: But this is in the context of the Vietnam War.  Are you being asked about the American policy in Vietnam?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And are you, I mean, how are you feeling about being an American with the Vietnam War going on and you're in Southeast Asia?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  It was very difficult, because like I said, I went over with this Third World view that we're all part of the same struggle.  And they were very anti-American.  You know, I ran into a lot of anti-American sentiment.  And, you know there's one other black student I think on the program.  He wasn't from Brown, he was from another school.  But it was weird for both of us, to all of a sudden be in a different environment where we were perceived as Americans first and African Americans second.  And, you know, where we had to change our way of life to fit in, you know.  It was during the "no wearing of bra" phase, but they weren't having that in Southeast Asia (laughter).  You know, your dresses had to be a certain length, or they would think you were a prostitute.  You couldn't hold hands with boys because that just wasn't allowed.  You know, so all of a sudden we had to learn all these norms of a culture that we weren't familiar with.  And we had to learn how to blend in.  So, it was really--as I said, it was an awakening for me as to how Americans were perceived, as to how black Americans were perceived.  You know, every time I went somewhere, they asked me about Muhammad Ali or Foxy Brown.  Those were the only two black Americans (laughter) they knew anything about.  It was like, "Do you know Muhammad?"  "No, I don't know Muhammad Ali."  "Do you know Foxy Brown?"  "No, I don't know Foxy Brown."  (laughter)  But I mean, it was just--and I guess it showed me the power of the media, or lack of power of the media, if this was the only images they had of Black America.
Speaker 1: And can you remind us who Foxy Brown was?
Speaker 2: Foxy Brown was one of the characters in, you know, the black exploitation movies.  It was, I think it was Pam Grier.  It was Pam Grier, and she had a big Afro.  And so, I guess because I had a big Afro, they just--that was the only thing they knew about black women.  They didn't have any other context.  So, that was, that was a learning experience.  And--
Speaker 1: Did you make any friends of Asians while you were there?
Speaker 2: I did.  Not any that I've held on to, but I did when I was there.  And, you know, I tried to bend to the culture and learn the culture.  I tried to explain that black Americans thought we were different from the America that they thought of.  But yet, here I was going to different countries in Southeast Asia, and expecting them to speak English to me (laughter), you know, which was something that made them very mad.  You know, so the more militant students, even though they all knew English--because they started English at a very early age--they would refuse to speak it.  They were like, "Well, if I came to New York, you know, I wouldn't find anyone speaking Thai or Malay to me on the streets of New York.  So, why should you all come to our country expecting us to speak English to you?"  And, you know, they also thought Americans were rude and, you know, bad travelers.  And so, I learned a lot about how our country was perceived.  And, you know, I think it changed my outlook on the world.  Now, after the program, I had planned to go to Japan and Singapore and travel for the whole summer.  But Vietnam fell while I was still in the program, and my father [Richard McLeash lee] wrote me and said, "Do not give up your ticket, come back on that ticket."  You know, because I was going to sell my airline ticket and get back the best way I could.  He said, "Come home right away."  And that's what I did.
Story_ID: 56858
Speaker 1: So, you leave Southeast Asia?
Speaker 2: Uh huh.
Speaker 1: You head straight back to Brown [University, Providence, Rhode Island], or you're back in--?
Speaker 2: I think I spent the summer in L.A. [Los Angeles, California], working, because I had a boyfriend at UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles] law school (laughter).  So, I went to L.A. for the summer and then I went back to Brown for my senior year.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what were you doing, work-wise in L.A.?
Speaker 2: I think I was working for a mortgage company. It was pretty much just temporary work.  It was nothing to speak of.
Speaker 1: So, let's return to Brown, then.  You're going into--this is now your senior year?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: What are you thinking about your future at this point and time?
Speaker 2: Well, I'm thinking that--I applied for law schools.  I applied to three schools in California, because I wanted to be near this boyfriend.  And I applied to Georgetown [University] and Columbia [University], just to make it look good. (laughter)
Speaker 1: For your father [Richard McLeash Lee]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, for my father (laughter).  He was still on my back.  And so, but I really wanted to go to either UCLA or Stanford [University], and [University of California] Berkeley.  Those are the three I applied to in L.A., in California.  And then I remember going to--
Speaker 1: Well let's--okay, the application process.  So, you're talking to--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --counselors at Brown--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --who are sort of giving you advice and--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Are you talking to fellow students?
Speaker 2: Yes, a little bit, because you know, the whole group--everyone had majored in poli-sci [political science], and they knew were going to law school.  So, I wanted to go to a good law school, but like I said, I was heading to L.A., I mean to California.  And then I went to see my dean, who actually lives in [Washington] D.C. [District of Columbia] now.  I'm still there.  And every time I see him, I remind him of the story.  But I went to him, and he looked at my transcript, and he looked at my applications where I was applying.  And he said to me, "You're not applying to Harvard [University] or Yale [University]."  And I said, "That's because I don't want to go to Harvard or Yale."  (laughter).  And so, he said, "Well, you have a really good, you know, record.  You should apply to Harvard or Yale."  And I said, "Really, I really don't want to go to Harvard or Yale."  And I told him that Yale had rejected me as an undergrad and that, you know, at Brown you spend four years at Brown being glad you're at Brown, and happy you're not at Harvard.  So, the last place I wanted to go was Harvard.  So, he said that, "I would strongly recommend that you apply to Harvard or Yale."  And I said, "Okay, well, I'll think about it."  And I remember leaving his office, walking across the college green, and just crying.  Because I knew if I applied to Harvard--and I knew I wasn't going to apply to Yale--because I held a grudge.  If I applied to Harvard and I got in, my dad would make me go, because his thing was you go to the best school you can.  And so, I applied to Harvard, but I never told my dad.  (laughter)  And then, you know, I got accepted at all the law schools, and got accepted at Harvard.  And when I got the acceptance, I decided to go.  And I have another story, but--
Speaker 1: We'll have to get to that.
Speaker 2: When I finally decided to go to Harvard, I remember calling my dad saying, "I'm going to Harvard."  And he said, "Harvard?  You didn't even apply to Harvard."  (laughter).  I said, "Oh yeah, I did, but I didn't want to tell you because I wanted to make the decision on my own."  But that's how I applied to Harvard Law School.  But, I was not sure that law school was what I wanted to do.
Story_ID: 56859
Speaker 1: So, you get accepted at Harvard [Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And instead of being gleeful, like a whole lot of folks would be--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --turning somersaults, you find yourself in tears.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And you're thinking--
Speaker 2: Well, I wasn't crying by that point.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: I'd gotten over it.  But--
Speaker 1: But you don't want to go to Harvard because of what?
Speaker 2: Well, I had this boyfriend (laughter) that was in, still in L.A. [Los Angeles, California].  So, I had to tell him I'm going to Harvard.  I wasn't thrilled about going to Boston [Massachusetts].  I had spent four years in New England, and it wasn't as wonderful as I thought.  I didn't really like New England.  It was too cold.  And what was the other thing?  The other thing was I wasn't sure I wanted to really go to law school.  At this point, I was really questioning whether I wanted to go to law school.  And I actually applied to art schools, because I wanted to be a fashion designer.  And while I was applying to law schools, I was also applying to art schools, and saying, you know, "I'm a poli-sci [political science] major from Brown [University, Providence, Rhode Island] (laughter), but I really want to be a fashion designer.  So, can I, you know, would you accept me into your program?"  And all these nice art schools wrote me back and said, "Well, send us your portfolio."  It's like, "Well, I don't have a portfolio, I've been majoring in Chinese Communist ideology."  And so, of course, I didn't get accepted to any of the art schools.  I also thought a little bit about architecture.  And so, I always had this creative side that really conflicted with what I thought was my smart side.  You know, I'm smart enough to get into Harvard, but I really don't, I'm not that excited about it.  You know, by that time, the Civil Rights era was kind of over.  So--
Speaker 1: This is what, 1970--.
Speaker 2: This is 1976.  So, it wasn't like the legal community was changing the society anymore, and you know, I wasn't--being a lawyer just sounded like hard work, and not much fun, and especially going to Harvard Law School (laughter).  But I guess that I'd spent four years at Brown happy I wasn't at Harvard.  And so, but, you know, that "You got to do the right thing" kinda came back to haunt me again.
Speaker 1: Was that your father's [Richard McLeash Lee] voice?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Got in--you know, you get into the best law school in the country, and you should go.  You know, it's an opportunity that most people would die for, and you're smart enough to do it, and you should do it.  And so, I grudgingly did it.  And you know, I was proud of the fact that I'd gotten into Harvard, you know, but it wasn't really what I want to do with life.
Story_ID: 56860
Speaker 1: And then, you know, I got to Harvard [University; Harvard Law School] (laughter)--
Speaker 2: Well, tell us about your trip to Harvard.  You had an interesting trip to Harvard.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I did.  I actually went back to Greensboro [North Carolina] with the boyfriend (laughter)...
Speaker 2: Your boyfriend from L.A. [Los Angeles, California]?
Speaker 1: From L.A.  He met me in Greensboro.  And we went to church and ran into a friend of the family who said, "You know, why don't you come over to my house.  My nephew is going to Harvard also, and he's visiting now, and I want you to meet him."  That was like the last thing I wanted to do, was to go meet some nerdy guy (laughter) who was going to Harvard, especially when I'm here with my boyfriend.  So, I told my boyfriend, "I got to over and meet this guy."  So, he stayed at my house, I went over and met this guy.  And he, you know, he seemed fine.  I talked to him.  And then he said, "Well, how are you getting up to Harvard?"  And I said, "I'm not sure.  You know, I'm going to [Washington] D.C. [District of Columbia] to see my dad [Richard McLeash Lee] and, you know, he may take me."  And he said, "Well, why don't you ride up with me?  You know, I'm riding up with a friend."  And I was like, "Okay."  And so, I came to D.C. and met him.  And his name--the fellow I rode up with was named Thomas Motley.  And he ended up being in my section, and has turned out to be, you know, one of my best friends in life.
Speaker 2: He's also a judge here in Washington [D.C.].
Speaker 1: He's also a judge here and--which goes to show you he took law school much more seriously than I did.  (laughter).  I fact, I didn't talk to him very much during law school because he was really into it, and I just, you know, was, you know, was trying to survive.  I was just trying to survive.  And, but, he has become a very good friend.  But you know, and he teases me, because all the way up the 95, I kept saying, "I am, you know, I should really be in L.A.  I don't know why I'm going to Boston [Massachusetts]."  And he still teases me about that to this day.  And he is of the view that I'm in the entertainment industry because it was my cry to get to L.A. (laughter)--that I couldn't get to L.A., so I brought L.A. to D.C.  But it's really funny.  And the other thing that I didn't mention is when I was applying to the art schools, I told my father that I wasn't sure about law school, and I wanted to take a year off.  And he said to me, "If you take a year off, you'll have to pay for law school."  And I was always very good with numbers, and I knew I didn't want to pay for law school (laughter).  I wasn't sure I wanted to go, but I knew I didn't want to pay for it.  So, that pressure made me go to law school straight from, straight from college, which sometimes I think was probably a mistake.  Because you know, I wasn't as happy in law school as I should have been, and didn't enjoy it as much.  But I think a lot of that was just not being sure what I really wanted to do.
Story_ID: 56861
Speaker 1: Well, you hit Boston [Massachusetts], and you see more turbulent times--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --in Boston.  Correct?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, talk about being in Boston.  You know, you've seen these things in Greensboro [North Carolina]--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and now you're in the North.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: In the liberal East.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: What's going on in Boston and around Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] at that time?
Speaker 2: Well, first of all, the city of Boston is going through its de-segregation of schools.  It was a lot longer in Boston than it was in Greensboro.   So, even though it happened in the early '70s [1970s] in Greensboro, it was just starting in Boston.  And Boston was having a very difficult time.  The judge had ordered de-segregation of the schools, and the very strong ethnic communities in Boston were revolting.  So, there was a lot of racial tension in Boston, which I didn't really expect, because you know, I knew that [Senator Robert "Bobby"] Kennedy sent--
Speaker 1: Senator Kennedy?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And you know, you always thought of Boston as a pretty, pretty liberal place.  But in the late '70s, it was a very hateful place.  And black, white, all kind of ethnicities in Boston were not getting along.  So, it was the first time I had really been told, "If you go to this neighborhood, you will get beat up.  Don't fall asleep on the Red Line and end up in South Boston.  You can't go to Fenway Park.  You can't go to the Garden.  You can't go to the north end for Italian food."  I mean, I--"You cannot wear your Harvard t-shirt downtown, or they will beat you up."  I mean, I'd never been in such a hostile environment where there were all these places you couldn't go.  And you know, you had to be careful, and you know--.  So, we--the time I was at Harvard, we spent most of the time in Cambridge [Massachusetts], scared to go--.  You know, you only went downtown if you needed your hair done or you needed a new coat.  And then you--.
Speaker 1: Off to college, right?
Speaker 2: Right, right (laughter).  Then you went quickly, and ran back to Cambridge, because Cambridge was very liberal and very, you know, socially acceptable.  But the rest of Boston was literally in a rage.  So, it was a very tough time to get there.  Then, on top of that, being at Harvard law School as a black woman was not a pleasant experience in the late '70s.
Speaker 1: How many black women were in your class?
Speaker 2: Now, that's a good question.  I don't know.  I know there were fifty black law students in my class, first-year law students.  That was the magic number.
Speaker 1: Fifty African Americans?
Speaker 2: Fifty African Americans.
Speaker 1: Out of five hundred?
Speaker 2: Out of five hundred students.  Yeah, each section was like 125, so there were about a hundred--five hundred students.  And fifty, I learned later, was the magic number that they tried to get for African Americans.  So, you felt like there was a good group of black folks.  Most of them came from Harvard College, so that's a whole different story.  But they were there.  So, at least ten of them came from Harvard College.  And I'm not exactly sure what the number of females were, but it was a lot less than the men.  You know, nowadays, there are more women in law school, but at that time there were a lot less.  So, being a woman and being an African American, and being someone who believed in societal change and public policy, was not a good place to be, at Harvard Law School (laughter).  And I found that out very quickly.  And I felt the environment at Harvard was not welcoming and, you know, I felt very out of place.
Story_ID: 56862
Speaker 1: The first year of law school is, you know, traditionally the most difficult year--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --of law school.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: How did you find the transition from Brown [University] , where you, you know were having a marvelous time--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --to coming [to Harvard Law School].  Let's go to your first day of class.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Tell us a little bit about that first day of class at Harvard.  And you've been assigned your section--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and you're sitting in the seat that you've been assigned.
Speaker 2: Yes.  So, I found it very overwhelming to walk into this class of 130 people, to have assigned seating.  I think I found out at the last minute, there were assignments (laughter).  That wasn't clear.  So, I think I did my assignment at the last minute.  But knowing, you know, I'm still a very shy person.  And knowing I was going to go into class everyday and have the potential of being called on to answer questions about cases that I wasn't sure I was understanding, was very nerve-wracking.  And you know, I looked around quickly to see how many women were in there and how many African Americans, and there were a handful.  And I quickly--and luckily my friend Thomas [Motley] was in my section and in my class, but it was very clear to me that I needed a support system, early on.  I needed to find people who thought like I did.  Now, the difference between going to Brown and going to Harvard, in retrospect, was at Brown I knew everyone was smart.  But they were trying to be normal and trying to, you know, "I could have gone to Harvard, but I really wanted to come to Brown."  At Harvard everyone was, you know, at the top of their class, from wherever they came from.  And they knew it, and they weren't afraid to show it.  (laughter)  So, you know, they were, "I'm at Harvard, I'm happy to be here.  I should be here, I'm smart."  And you know, I found that very off-putting.  That just wasn't the kind of person I was.  So, and then, you know, I didn't have much in common with my professors.  And then I only had one black professor, Clyde Ferguson, who decided to call on me the first week of class, which sent me in to a tizzy.  And then he called on me for a case called Sara Sinsky (ph) versus somebody, which was a case he was going to come back to, you know, ten times during the year.  And he made that very clear.  So, you know, I was, I was a nervous wreck.  I hated law school, I hated the student body, I hated the professors (laughter).  I had one or two friends.  I met a good girlfriend also.  And--
Speaker 1: Who was that?
Speaker 2: Her name is Cynthia Welsh, and she was from Birmingham, Alabama.  And so, she was from the South like I was.  She was in a different section, so we couldn't really study together.  I stayed away from study groups and, you know, I think it was the first time in my life I really felt kind of like I was an imposter, like I wasn't supposed to be there.  You know, not that I didn't think I was as smart as everyone else but, you know, it isn't really what I want to do.  They didn't think like I did.  It just--you know, there was more mixing, you know.  The black students didn't really stick together, because so many of them, you know, had come from all white schools.  And so, many of them were trying to make Law Review or whatever, and trying to fit in.  So, I didn't feel like there was a sense of community like Brown.  And--
Speaker 1: Were you part active in BALSA, the Black Law Students Association?
Speaker 2: A little bit.  I remember going to a BALSA convention, I want to say in Cleveland [Ohio], my first year.  So, I was pretty active.  But I really didn't like it, and early on during the first year, decided to apply to Kennedy School to get me out of that environment.  Because the Kennedy School, I thought, offered me a chance to a dual degree, but also to go into government and get out of this law firm, you know, "Got to do the Harvard Law way."  (laughter)
Story_ID: 56863
Speaker 1: The [John F.] Kennedy School [of Government] is the school for government [at Harvard University]--
Speaker 2: That's correct.
Speaker 1: --and politics, essentially.
Speaker 2: Right.  The grad--
Speaker 1: Policy.
Speaker 2: The graduate school for--yeah.  And I was still interested in policy.  I still thought law was a way to change policy, but that wasn't taught very much at Harvard.  I remember there were some professors at Harvard, that if you mentioned the word policy they would go off, and say, "This is not about policy, this is about what the law says.  You know, we're here to teach you the law, and that's what this is about."  And there's a push to get you into corporate law firms, which is not what I wanted to do.  Then there was, you know, people who wanted to do litigation.  I didn't want to do that, so I really had to find my way.  So, I thought early on about, you know, found out about the Kennedy School and applied, and decided to do a joint program.
Speaker 1: And the Kennedy School, so you did your first year--
Speaker 2: At law school [Harvard Law School].
Speaker 1: --at law school.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And then you did your second year at the Kennedy School?
Speaker 2: The second year at the Kennedy School, and the last two years at both.
Speaker 1: So, tell me what, if any, how you felt--the difference between the Kennedy School versus being at the law school?
Speaker 2: I thought the students at the Kennedy School were much more interested in policy and in changing the world and, you know, going into government, doing great things.  I mean, it's not to say they were all liberal Democrats, but they all wanted to give back in some way.  And that was, that felt very different from the law school.  It wasn't as competitive.  You know, law school, I just felt was overwhelmingly competitive.  You couldn't even go--I lived in the dorm the first semester.  You couldn't even brush your teeth without people asking you about (laughter) coursework, or how you did on this exam, or what you were doing.  I mean it was just, it just was not the kind of environment I liked.  So, I moved off campus (laughter) the second semester, got a boyfriend at medical school.  So, I didn't have to talk about law school, (laughter) and really tried to do it on my own.  And you know when I look back at it, it probably wasn't the best way.  You know, people say "You weren't in a study group?"  I said I didn't even want to talk about law, with anybody.  You know, I was the kind of person who always liked doing it myself.  And you know studying by myself, trying to figure it out, and--.  Law school was a different way of approaching life, which was very different.  You know, being forced to speak in class and to be analytical on the spot was something that just didn't do well with me.  You know, I just wasn't that kind of learner.  You know, I was the kind of learner--I took notes, I went back and studied my notes, and then I regurgitated (laughter) the notes.  And you needed to do so much more than that in law school.  And I, you know, eventually got the hang of it.  I did well, but it just, it didn't agree with the kind of personality I have.
Speaker 1: So, Kennedy School, second year.  This is 1977?
Speaker 2: Uh huh.
Speaker 1: Then you come back to law school, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Now, what's the re-entry like for you?  You're back in an environment that you found hostile?
Speaker 2: Right.  But I found it to be easier, because my class had moved on.  So, I--
Speaker 1: The people--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  The people I started law school with were now--when I got back to law school, they were third year.  So, they were thinking about what they were going to do next.  So, I was second year with a different class, and it wasn't as competitive.  I was able to do my own thing, to go back and forth between the Kennedy School and the law school, to pick those law school courses that I was interested in, you know, not just the required ones.
Story_ID: 56864
Speaker 1: I started clerking for a judge.  I found out I liked court administration.
Speaker 2: You were clerking in Boston [Massachusetts] at that time?
Speaker 1: In Salem, Massachusetts and, you know, just on a part-time basis, and with a judge that taught at the law school.  And I became friendly with him.  And I became friendly with some professors at the Kennedy School [of Government at Harvard University].  And I did my thesis on court management and court administration.  And I found my niche.  I started doing things.  I was part of the board of student advisors.  Do you remember that?  They were the ones who administered moot court, and they also advised first year students.  I didn't mention this, but I also did that kind of mentoring and counseling at Brown [University].  I was what they called a minority peer counselor.  So, I always found I enjoyed that, giving back and advising students.  So--
Speaker 2: So, you're finding your stride at this point?
Speaker 1: Yeah, right.  And I'm able to decide where I want to work and, you know, what I want to do.  I came to Washington [District of Columbia] and worked for [Department of] Health and Human Services one summer.  I worked for a judge for a summer.  So, I was able to get out of that really, you know, hard-nosed competitive environment at Harvard, and really use Harvard for what I wanted to use it for.
Speaker 2: So, you had started to define what you wanted Harvard to be for you?
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Story_ID: 56865
Speaker 1: I'm Deborah Lathan, with Matthew [Hickey] as our videographer [for The HistoryMakers].  And Miss Debra Lee, would you please give us today's date and our location?
Speaker 2: Today's date is June 14, 2012.  And we're at the BET [Black Entertainment Television] headquarters in Washington, D.C. [District of Columbia].
Speaker 1: And the address here is?
Speaker 2: The address here is 1235 W Street, Northeast.
Speaker 1: So, the last time we spoke, you were on your way to graduate from Harvard Law School and the [Harvard] Kennedy School [of Government].
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: So, tell us a little bit about--you know, after graduation, what had you decided you wanted to do?
Speaker 2: Well, when I was graduating from the law school and the Kennedy School with a master's in public policy, my goal was to go into government.  I had accepted a job with the policy office at the Securities and Exchange Commission [SEC].  And from all my research and everything I had gathered, the SEC was considered one of the best agencies, the Securities and Exchange Commission.  So, I was going to their policy office, and I accepted a job.  I was well on my way.  I hadn't graduated yet, but during the end of the year, right before graduation, a judge that I worked for at Harvard came to me and said there's a judge in D.C. who was looking for a clerk, and would I be interested?  And that was interesting, because I hadn't applied for any clerkships.  I didn't really want to litigate, and I kind of had the view that if you want, if you're interested in litigation, you should do a clerkship.  But when one kind of falls in your lap (laughter), it's hard to turn it down.  So, I went and talked to the judge in Washington.  His name was Barrington Parker.  And I accepted the clerkship, and that changed the course of my career.
Story_ID: 56866
Speaker 1: Tell us a little bit about Judge [Barrington] Parker.  He was a Republican, correct?
Speaker 2: Yes, he was.
Speaker 1: Tell me a little bit about--what was he like as a person, and what kind of things did he have you do?
Speaker 2: Well, I was his third clerk.  He had a multi-district case called National Student Marketing, which was a well-known securities case that had been going on for years.  And because it was such complex litigation, and it was several jurisdictions that combined their cases, he got a clerk specifically on that case.
Speaker 1: Well, what was the case being litigated about?  What was the subject matter?
Speaker 2: It was a securities case.  There--it was so long ago, I don't remember much about it.  But--
Speaker 1: Securities fraud, basically?
Speaker 2: Yeah, securities fraud kind of case.  So, I handled primarily that, but I would pick up other cases along the way.  So, I was like any other clerk, except I had this one major complex case.  And Judge Parker was a Republican.  He was an African American judge.  And he was a hard taskmaster.  He was, had a reputation for being tough on lawyers, especially young lawyers.  He had a reputation for being tough on clerks.  He thought a clerkship should be like a boot camp.  So, it was like first year law school all over again, on a one-on-one basis.  And, but he was, he was really concerned about clerks, and about training you the right way.  So, it was a great experience.  It was painful at times, you know, because as I said, he was very tough.  But it was a great experience.
Speaker 1: This is 1980--
Speaker 2: '80 [1980].
Speaker 1: 1980.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And he also had, he had several big cases.  Judge Parker handled the John Hinckley case, and that was just starting as I was leaving, because President [Ronald] Reagan was shot while I was clerking.  And Judge Parker received the Hinckley case.  He also had a case on [Orlando] Letelier, who was an ambassador that was in a car bomb.  So, he had some high visibility, important cases.  So, it was a great experience.
Speaker 1: So, this is your entree, though, into Washington [District of Columbia] as a young professional.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So, what, who are you interacting with socially?  What is life like in Washington in 1980 as a young, black professional?
Speaker 2: Right.  Well, it's interesting.  As a clerk, you pretty much socialize with whosever at the court.  That can be, you know, prosecutors or defense counsel.  It could be the clerks, the secretaries to the judges.  So, you're, you're kind of in this weird, in-between point.  You know, you're not really a staff person like the clerks and the marshals and people that are there all the time, but you're not really a lawyer, either.  So, you're not up to the level of defense counsel or a prosecutor.  So, it was an interesting transition.  You know, I socialized with other clerks.  And judgeship is a lonely profession, because judges don't socialize a lot.  So, it was an interesting introduction to Washington, to see Washington through the court system.  The court system is very independent, and even though you're aware of politics around you, it's not really influenced that much by politics.  But it is influenced a lot by, you know, what's happening in the world day to day.  So, it was an interesting place to be.
Story_ID: 56867
Speaker 1: So, when your clerkship [with Judge Barrington Parker] was over, where did you go next?
Speaker 2: Well, when it was time to move on from the clerkship, I actually went back to a firm that had turned me down before (laughter) as a summer associate.  Steptoe & Johnson [LLC, Washington, D.C.] is the firm I ended up with.  And I had interviewed with them, and I was just very impressed with the lawyers there, and how it was known for a law firm with a heart.  You don't hear of very many law firms described that way.  So, even though they had turned me down when I applied for a summer clerkship when I was in law school, I went back to Steptoe, interviewed, and got an offer this time.  And that was actually the only firm I interviewed with.
Speaker 1: And what area of law were you in working in when you went to Steptoe?
Speaker 2: Well, I went to Steptoe to hide out until the Democrats came back.  And so, I was convinced I was going to go into government.
Speaker 1: So, you still want to do SEC [Securities and Exchange Commission] type work?
Speaker 2: Or some other agency.  I wasn't sure after doing securities for a year, that that was my passion.  But I thought I would go back into government.  So, I started doing regulatory work.  And I started with oil and gas, because Steptoe had Atlantic Richfield [Company; ARCO] as one of their clients.  So, I did a lot of Atlantic Richfield work.  I did some transportation work.  And then I started doing communications work, and found out that I really loved that.  That was, after a year or two it was clear that's where I wanted to specialize.  Tyrone Brown, who used to be FCC [Federal Communications Commission] Commissioner, was working at Steptoe.  He was a partner there, and I started working with him on quite a few clients.  And that's how I met BET [Black Entertainment Television].
Speaker 1: Well, how--before you get to BET, how is that law firm environment back then?  This is 1980--
Speaker 2: '81 [1981].
Speaker 1: '81, [1981].  Steptoe is a premiere firm.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And African Americans are just now starting to enter into the large law firms.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: What was the environment?  Were there other African American lawyers there?  What was the environment like to you?
Speaker 2: The environment at Steptoe during that time was actually pretty good.  We had (laughter), we had a dozen African American lawyers.  We had ten associates and two partners.  And that was by far the largest number of African Americans at any law firm in [Washington] D.C. [District of Columbia].  And so, we felt like we had a good group of attorneys, and a good support system.  Steptoe was a friendly firm.  You know, when I first got there the firm was growing, and it was one of the more well-known firms.  So, I had a good experience there for several years.  We did go through a period where the firm started not growing as fast, and went through periods of layoffs.  And I think one by one, African American attorneys left for one reason or another.  One or two went to the U.S. Attorneys Office, some others went into government.  So, it was an interesting time.  And I think I realized after about three years that being at a firm was not what I wanted to do.
Speaker 1: So, you did not want to become a partner at Steptoe?
Speaker 2: No, no.  And when I got to my fifth year of being an associate, I had to make that decision whether I was going to buckle down and work really hard for two years to try to make partner, or whether it was time to go.  And I decided my fifth year was time to go.  The Democrats hadn't come back fast enough (laughter), but it was still time to go.  I had learned a lot, it was great training, but I did not see my future being a partner at a law firm.
Story_ID: 56868
Speaker 1: And what did you see your future as--if you saw your future?
Speaker 2: Well, at that time I thought I wanted to go in-house with a communications company.  I knew I liked communications, and I wanted to do more in that industry.  So, I actually started interviewing a lot in New York.  I interviewed with HBO, interviewed with CBS Records, with CBS.  So, I had quite a few interviews in New York.  And every time I'd come back to [Washington] D.C., I realized how much I liked D.C., and I wasn't quite ready to move to New York.  And around that time, BET [Black Entertainment Television] was a client, and I was doing more and more work for BET.  And I went out to lunch with Bob [Robert L.] Johnson.  I actually went to a cable hearing with Bob Johnson and Ty [Tyrone] Brown.  Bob Johnson had won the cable franchise for the District of Columbia, and he and Ty Brown were negotiating the cable contract with the city.  And so, I was helping out on that as an associate.  And lunchtime came, and there was a break in the hearing.  And Ty Brown went to, had to go back to the firm.  And Bob Johnson looked at me and said, "Well, do you want to grab lunch?"  And I said, "Sure."  And so, we went to lunch.  And during that lunch, he asked me if I was interested in coming over to be general counsel at BET.  He said BET had gotten to the point--at that point BET was five years old, about five years old.  And he said the company was at the point where he thought he needed in-house, an in-house lawyer.  They didn't have one at the time, and that they couldn't afford to keep paying Steptoe [& Johnson LLP].  And he asked was I interested, and I said, "Yeah, I'd be interested in talking to you."  And so, that was the first overture from Bob to me to come over to BET.
Speaker 1: And that was before you went to interview in New York at CBS, and HBO and the other places?
Speaker 2: No, it was actually afterwards.
Speaker 1: Afterwards?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So when did you--
Speaker 2: Or during that same time.
Speaker 1: When did you decide that you would actually take him up on coming to BET?
Speaker 2: BET?  Well, it took a couple of months.  And he told me to go talk to Ty Brown (laughter), which I did.  And I told Ty I was interested.  And then there was no follow-up for a few months.  And then I realized one day, I said, I'm going to have to make this deal directly with Bob.  It's not going to come through Ty.  Because Ty was outside counsel, so it was in his interest to keep the business.  And so, I called Bob and said, you know--well, I called his secretary--and said, you know, I want to come in and talk to him.  And I told him I was ready to leave Steptoe, and was he still looking for a general counsel.  And he said yeah, it would be perfect timing.  And so, it worked out.  But I think when he offered me the job, I knew it was the right position.  One, it was a black-owned company which I was very interested in.  Two, it was in the entertainment industry, and three, it was in D.C., I didn't have to leave.  So, I could stay in this town I loved, and I could go to a black-owned company doing the kind of television programming that I was very interested in.  The funniest thing is at the time there was no cable yet in D.C., so I really hadn't even seen BET.  It wasn't airing in D.C. at the time.  So, it was really a leap of faith.
Story_ID: 56869
Speaker 1: On that note, did you have naysayers--people are telling you you're crazy, you're giving up, you know, the partnership at Steptoe [and Johnson LLP] for cable. Cable will never last, and a black cable company's never going to make it,  you know, what are you thinking?  Did you get that type of response from people?
Speaker 2: Yes, I got a lot of naysayers, especially from partners at the law firm.  Usually, people--if they left the law firm, they go into government for a couple of years and then come back.  Not many people in [Washington] D.C. [District of Columbia] would leave to go to a company.  First of all, there are not that many companies in D.C.  So, a lot of the partners thought I was giving up on my future, and taking a high risk.  I remember a partner saying cable's never going to last.  MMDS [Multichannel Multipoint Distribution Service] is going to put it out of business.  Satellite's going to put it out of business.  So, there were a lot of people who said that this was not a good decision.  And that included my father [Richard McLeash Lee], who at the time when I told him, you know, he never knew these kind of corporate law firms existed.  I never knew they existed, until I went to Harvard Law School and started interviewing.  So, my dad lived in Baltimore [Maryland], and he would come over and visit me at Steptoe.  And he was just so impressed.  There was, you know, antique furniture and two hundred lawyers and, you know, secure and, you know, it's a wonderful opportunity for his daughter.  And when I told him I wanted to leave, he said, "Well, why would you leave this wonderful position?"  And I said, "Well, Dad, I'm just not having fun any more."  And he said, "Well, if it was supposed to be fun, they wouldn't call it work." (laughter)  And so, he kind of stopped me in my tracks, and I really had to think about it.  And you know, he was a career military [U.S. Army] guy.  So, there wasn't anything fun about his job. (laughter).  And so, he was hesitant that I was going to go work for this company no one had heard of.  But over time, after I joined BET [Black Entertainment Television] he became very proud of it, and what I was doing.  And every time he saw an article about BET or Bob [Robert L.] Johnson, he'd cut it out and send it to me.  So, over time, he understood.
Speaker 1: And your mother [Delma Louise Taylor Lee] was okay with it?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  My mother was very supportive all through my life, no matter what I did.  You know, my father had high standards and pushed me, but my mother was just supportive.  I remember when I, the first time I took the bar, I actually didn't pass.  And I remember telling my father, and how disappointed he was.  I remember telling my mother, and she just hugged me and, you know, told me everything was going to be alright.  I actually appealed the decision, and I was admitted on appeal.  So, that was a good learning experience.  I didn't have to take the bar over again, thank goodness.  But I had to go in and convince them, and write this, you know, essay on why my answers were right.  But I always use that instance as an indication of how different my mother and father were (laughter).  You know, I had one very strict parent, and one who, you know, supported me no matter what.  So, yeah, she was very supportive at the time.
Story_ID: 56870
Speaker 1: Now, are you married at this point and time of your career?
Speaker 2: Let me think about that.
Speaker 1: When you were at Steptoe [& Johnson LLP].
Speaker 2: I, the first year I was at Steptoe, I was married.  And then I got divorced that year.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, you were divorced--
Speaker 2: Uh huh.
Speaker 1: --and you're heading off to BET [Black Entertainment Television] to be general counsel?
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: You're here at BET as general counsel.
Speaker 2: And I think I was re-married a year before I went to BET.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, and--
Speaker 2: I had been married during law school [Harvard Law School].
Speaker 1: Okay.  And then you re-married.  Was this to Gary?
Speaker 2: To Randy [Randall Coleman].
Speaker 1: Randy.
Speaker 2: Coleman, right.
Speaker 1: Randy Coleman, okay.  But no children at this point and time?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: This was 1986.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, you come to BET?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And you're the first general counsel of BET?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Tell us, what was that like?
Speaker 2: Wow, that was quite a transition, to go from a 200-person firm to BET where I was the only attorney.  No one--you know, I wouldn't say they didn't care about the law, but it wasn't the first thing on their mind. (laughter)  They were interested in putting programming on the air.  And when I came, Bob [Robert L.] Johnson announced, "From now on, Debra has to see every contract.  You know, every legal issue goes through her."  So, I wasn't welcomed with open arms.  I was seen as a hurdle that people had to overcome, to just keep doing their jobs. They just didn't understand why all of a sudden, you know, the company was so concerned about legal issues.  And one of the reasons is the company was becoming more visible.  You know, you can take a lot of risks when you're small and you don't have a lot of subscribers and viewers, but the bigger you become, the less risk you want to take.  So, it took me a lot of time to build relationships with the other executives--convince them that I was there to help them, not to keep them from doing their job.  So, it was a very interesting experience.  Plus, I didn't have a very big budget.  I had like, you know, Bob took--before I joined BET, there was a hundred thousand dollar legal budget.  When I joined BET, Bob gave me fifty thousand as my salary, and told me I could have the other fifty thousand for whatever else I needed--travel, books, staff, (laughter), outside legal fees.  And I remember saying to him, "Well, I can't, you know, that's not very much money (laughter) for outside legal fees."  He said, "Why would you need outside legal fees?  You're an attorney, can't you do everything?"  I said, "I said like, well, I can't do everything.  I really, you know, I'm a regulatory attorney.  I've done some corporate things at Steptoe, but not even a lot of that."  So, anyway, I always say the first couple years at BET, I just worried a lot. (laughter)  And I started this general counsel club of people.  We would go out to lunch and give each other free advice, because I couldn't afford to hire anyone.  I didn't have--I had a secretary.  I started hiring clerks on a voluntary basis and, you know, I just tried to keep the ship from going under for a couple of years.  It was kind of scary.
Story_ID: 56871
Speaker 1: Well, who were the people here with you?  Who were the BET [Black Entertainment Television] executives at that time that you had to interface with in all your legal matters?
Speaker 2: Well, there's a head of programming, there's a head of advertising, affiliate sales, a CFO [chief financial officer]--. What else was there?  So, there were only maybe six or seven executives, most of whom had kind of grown up at BET.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Was Herb Wilkins [also a HistoryMaker], wasn't he, he had some input into BET?
Speaker 2: Herb Wilkins was on the board, and he was an advisor to Bob [Robert L. Johnson; founder of BET].  But he was on the board of directors--he was on the board of directors.  Tyrone Brown was the secretary of the company; Bob's wife was on the board; Dell Lewis, who was the CEO [chief executive officer] of CMP Telephone, was on the board.  At a certain point and time, Denzel Washington came on the board.  I remember that was very exciting.  John Malone from TCI was on the board, and Jeff Bukus (ph) from HBO.
Speaker 1: Well, what was the--
Speaker 2: So, TCI and HBO were the major investors in the company.
Speaker 1: And what were the revenues looking like at that time?
Speaker 2: When I joined the company, BET had an annual revenue of ten million dollars.
Speaker 1: How many subscribers?
Speaker 2: Ten million.
Speaker 1: You were in ten million homes?
Speaker 2: No--yes, ten million homes.
Speaker 1: Ten million homes--
Speaker 2: Ten million dollars in subscription revenue, I mean, of revenue overall.  The company had just entered the black, it was just beginning to make money.
Speaker 1: And what was the programming--?
Speaker 2: And we had eighty employees.  Those are the three numbers I remember.  And the programming was primarily music videos, old movies that they would go to the Library of Congress and get, because the copyright had expired (laughter).  'Bobby Jones Gospel' has been one of our long-term shows.  We had black college sport--football and basketball at that time, and a few sit-coms--broken series mostly, where we acquired for very little money.
Speaker 1: And you weren't located in these wonderful corporate headquarters at that time, either?  Where were you located?
Speaker 2: When I joined BET in 1986, the corporate office was a townhouse in Georgetown.  And the production offices were in Alexandria, Virginia.  We rented studio space from the Moon family.  They had a company called Atlantic Video.
Story_ID: 56872
Speaker 1: So, the first year as the general counsel [at Black Entertainment Television (BET)] was difficult.  And then what happens next?
Speaker 2: I think, I want to say a couple of years into it--it must have been around 1988--so I'd been there about two years--.  Bob [Robert L.] Johnson and Jeff Lee, who was head of programming, decided that BET should have its own production facilities, and that we should leave Atlantic Video Studios in Virginia.  And I remember being involved in looking for land, which we found in Northeast [Washington] D.C. [District of Columbia].  And Bob wanted someone to run that project, and he decided that person should be me.  He didn't want Jeff to run it, because he thought Jeff would build a mausoleum to himself.  So, he put me in charge of it, and that was the first business affairs I was interested--I mean, involved in full-time at BET.
Speaker 1: The construction of the studio?
Speaker 2: Yes, the loan, getting the loan from Aetna, who loaned us $12 million dollars to build the facility--hiring the construction company, the architects, and building Studio A in Northeast Washington.
Speaker 1: And did Bob let you go beyond your $50,000 a year legal budget for this project?
Speaker 2: Yeah, a little bit.  I think we could, you know, charge that to the--we hired some outside lawyers for that.  I think at the time, Steptoe [& Johnson LLP] was still our outside counsel.  So, I did that, on top of being general counsel, and it was a great experience.  It took a couple of years to build, and I ended up being pregnant at the time, also.  I had my first son.  He was born two weeks before the studio was opened.  No, no, no, the studio came first.  We had the opening of the studio, and then he was born two weeks later.
Speaker 1: This would be Quinn?
Speaker 2: Yes.  So, it was a race to the finish, as to whether the building would come first, or my child. (laughter)  I remember at the opening of the building, having very thick ankles.  (laughter)  I was nine months pregnant, walking around wearing a hard hat, trying to make sure this building was finished.
Speaker 1: But you're enjoying life at this point and time?
Speaker 2: Well, I had--well, I wouldn't say I was really enjoying life.  I was pregnant (laughter), but I was excited.  And, you know, building a building was pretty nerve wracking.  It was the first time I'd done something like that.  And there was a lot of pressure to build it on time, and on budget.  I was able to do that.  So, it was exciting, but it was a little nerve wracking also.  I found the years, early years at BET were very nerve wracking.  You know, I was worried about being sued by someone, and the whole company going down the tubes, because we had some big settlement or some big, you know, thing we had to pay.  And you know, really just trying to make sure the company was successful.  So, it was exciting, but it was also very scary.
Story_ID: 56873
Speaker 1: So, the studio's [Black Entertainment Television (BET), Washington, D.C.] up, Quinn [Lee's first child, a son] is born?
Speaker 2: Uh huh.
Speaker 1: What's the next step in your career?
Speaker 2: Well, the next step I remember is I came back from maternity leave--first of all, I had to write the maternity leave policy (laughter) before I could go have my child, because I was the first executive, female executive at BET to become pregnant.  So, that was funny.  I was like, okay, let me write a policy.  I wrote a policy that said you could have three months off, and I thought that was doing something.  Of course, in my case, I had no attorneys working for me at the time, so three months off just meant I worked from home instead of at the company.  And then I came back from my maternity leave, and I remember being--I think it must have been the first or second senior staff meeting.  And Bob [Robert L.] Johnson [founder of BET] announced that he was starting a teen magazine, and that he needed someone to run it.  And so, a couple of the guys volunteered, and he said no, no.  And so, finally somebody said--well, and you know, I'm hiding, because I have a child (laughter), and I'm trying to keep up with my legal work.  So, the last thing I want is another assignment.  And so, someone said, you know, "Bob, who do you want to do it?  You keep saying no."  And he said, "Well, I want Debra to do it."  And so, I was like, "Oh, okay, glad to do it."  And so, all of a sudden I'm in the magazine business.  And on top of my legal department--and now I'm doing other business affairs, now all of a sudden I have to put together a new magazine.  But I really, really enjoyed that.  It was so much fun.
Speaker 1: What was the name of the magazine?
Speaker 2: It was called 'YSB', for 'Young Sisters and Brothers'.  So, Bob had decided he wanted male and females, he wanted it to be teen, he wanted it to be uplifting and inspirational, he wanted it to be high-quality.  You know, he wanted something to come in the mail to young African American teenagers that was, you know, they knew was theirs, and yet they felt good about it.  So, you know, he's willing to spend the money to do it right.  And I had to go hire an editor, an art director, you know, a subscription person.  So, overnight I had to learn the magazine business.  And I learned in the process I really, really loved it.  And--
Speaker 1: You guys published some other magazines as well.  Didn't you do 'Emerge'?
Speaker 2: Yes, we bought 'Emerge' during that period.  And we also--I started 'BET Weekend', which was an insert into, a monthly insert, to the newspaper.  It was kind of like 'Parade'.  So, that was an exciting time.  And now, also during that period, Bob decided--or John Malone suggested and Bob agreed--to take BET public.  So, I was starting a magazine, running the legal department, and taking BET public, all at the same time.
Speaker 1: And just for clarification, John Malone was one of the large investors from Liberty Mutual, right?
Speaker 2: Liberty Media, yes.
Speaker 1: Liberty Media.
Speaker 2: Originally, TCI turned into Liberty Media.
Speaker 1: Now, are you corporate secretary at this point and time?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, you're also the corporate secretary.  And, you're corporate secretary, you're the general counsel, you're doing publications--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and you're getting ready to go public?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, what we're--
Speaker 2: And I have a baby (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous).
Story_ID: 56874
Speaker 1: So, now we're around 1989, and BET [Black Entertainment Television] is getting ready to go private, is that correct?
Speaker 2: Go public.
Speaker 1: Public, I'm sorry, you're already private.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Go public.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So, tell us what your role was in that, and the nature of the business.  Obviously, profits were up for the company.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And what was behind that decision that you go public?
Speaker 2: The decision to go to public was made in order to raise capital for BET to go into other areas, and other businesses.  The studio was built by that time [in Washington, D.C.], the basic cable network was doing well, and the question was how do we expand the brand, how do we grow the business?  So, the theory was if we went public, we could raise money to use to invest in other areas, which is what we did.  And I was in charge of making--I was general counsel at the time, I was running the magazines--but I was in charge of making sure the company was ready to go public, which meant getting all the contracts in order, getting everything ready, so when the team of investment bankers and lawyers came in, we would be ready to go public.  And you know, part of going public is putting the whole company on being very exposed, because you have to do quarterly filings, and analysts follow you.  So, you know, that's a big transition, to go from a public--go from a private company to a publicly traded company.  So, it took about, that process took about ten months.  And during those ten months, I worked closely with outside counsel and with the investment bankers.  We had two investment banking firms--First Boston and Bear Stearns, I think it was.  And Skadden Arps was our outside counsel.  And we were actually the first African American company to be traded on the New York Stock Exchange [NYSE].  So, that was very exciting.  And I was working around the clock, you know, trying to get the documents ready.  We had to go through SEC [Securites and Exchage Commission] review, working with the printer, you know, trying to get everything ready.  And during that same period, we printed the first 'YSB Magazine' ['Young Sisters and Brothers'].  So, I remember that I went to Stanford [University, Stanford, California] to take a two-week course on publishing, to get better prepared to run 'YSB'.  And during that two weeks, I came back to [Washington] D.C. to, one, meet with First Boston.  That was our first meeting with First Boston.  And then I left there after, you know, meeting with the investment bankers and trying to figure out that whole process.  And then I went down to Florida to the printing press to watch YSB come off the printing press for the first time, which was very exciting.  It was almost like having another baby (laughter).  I was like, "Wow, we're birthing something here."  And then I went back to Stanford to finish the second week of the publishing course.  So, that was a pretty hectic point in my life also, but it was very exciting.
Story_ID: 56875
Speaker 1: Were there challenges to going public [Black Entertainment Television (BET)] from any investors or anyone else?  And what were some of the, what were the big challenges, I guess I want to ask you, in taking BET public?
Speaker 2: The big challenges were, you know, getting everything in shape so that we could answer all the questions; make sure all our documents were--and contracts were in the right shape; pricing the shares, you know, figuring out what the asking price would be; going on the road show.  Luckily, they wouldn't let the lawyer, me, go on the road show, so I stayed back in the office.  But going on the road show, selling the stock, explaining the business, explaining why BET was a good value, you know, explaining the company to analysts.  So, there were a lot of challenges.  And we were a pretty small-sized company with a small corporate staff.  You know, my legal department was still small.  The finance department was small.  And all of a sudden we're in a league with, you know, the Fortune 500 companies.  So, it was a lot of work, and took a lot to get the company ready.  When we went public, I'm going to say the first quarter we had some issues on, with our analysts.  We hired consultants to get us ready to answer analysts' questions, but we had one analyst call that didn't go very well.  And for some reason, certain questions weren't able to be answered, and our stocks started falling that day.  And SEC [Securities and Exchange Commission] started a review of the stock, and what had happened.  And we recovered, but that was a rude awakening, in terms of what being public meant--that, you know, you have to have your finance department and legal department ready to answer any questions.  If there are any, you know, controversy about the numbers, you have to be able to explain it.  So, you know, it was a lot of changes that the company as a whole had to get used to.
Story_ID: 56876
Speaker 1: So, in your new environment you're still general counsel, corporate secretary, and you're running the publishing industry?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: What is the next move for you at BET [Black Entertainment Television]?
Speaker 1: Ummm--
Speaker 2: Career move.
Speaker 1: The next move was, at a certain point I was put in charge of business development and strategic development.  So, anytime we did a joint venture--after we became public--we took that capital and started investing it in new businesses.  So, we were in the restaurant business and the movie business, and the clothing business, and the credit card--.  I mean we were doing--
Speaker 2: Internet?
Speaker 1: Internet, yeah we started 'MSBET', which was a joint venture with Microsoft, which later became BET.com.  We were in internet.  So, we were starting businesses like crazy.  So, I was put in charge of business development and strategic development, which meant anytime we did a deal, I was, you know, more involved than just the attorney.  I was doing the strategic work also, because we didn't really have a business affairs department.  Some companies have legal affairs and business affairs.  We never had that at BET, so the legal department had to the business issues also.
Speaker 2: Now, at this point and time, the legal department is more than Debra Lee?
Speaker 1: Yes.  Well, I may have had one or two attorneys by then.  And so, it was growing.  And my legal budget was growing.  So, that was a good thing.  And then I remember at one point I asked Bob [Robert L. Johnson] could I give up the general counsel title and just run the magazines, because I was enjoying that so much.  And we had three magazines at that point, and my magazine staff was growing.  And he said "No."  (laughter)  He said he didn't want another lawyer.  And I said, "Well, you know, there are tons of lawyers in [Washington] D.C. [District of Columbia].  You could find a lawyer easier than another business person."  And I said, "You know, I can't continue to do both."  Because as general counsel, you should be keeping up with changes in the law; you should be worrying about the legal issues twenty-four hours a day.  And I felt like I was really spending too much time away from the legal issues.  And I just said as a publicly traded company, I felt very uneasy about that, that I wasn't able to do both.  And I didn't want to give up the magazines, because I loved that too much.  But when he said, no, I said "Okay, well I've got to do both," because I didn't want to give up the magazines.  And so, at some point he came up with--Bob decided that he would offer me the position of Chief Operating Officer [COO], which was an interesting concept, because that position didn't exist before he offered it to me.  And I think it was his way of figuring out a way that I could continue to do the business things and stay involved in the legal issues.  So, as COO, everyone at the company reported to me.  And Bob pretty much stepped back from the operations of the company.  And I think it was also the time he was thinking about what he wanted to do next in life, and had--
Speaker 2: So, this is, around the time that you guys went public, in 19--
Speaker 1: No, this--well, we went public in 1991.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Then we went private in 1998.
Story_ID: 56877
Speaker 1: So, we [Black Entertainment Television (BET)] had only been--we were only publicly traded for seven years.
Speaker 2: Okay, let's talk about that for a minute.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, you're publicly trading for seven years [1991-1998].  What was behind the decision to then go private again after having gone public?
Speaker 1: Right.  Well, what happened is that we were in all these new businesses.  And the cable network, BET, was continuing to grow.  But we wanted to get into several new businesses that we weren't sure the street, or analysts, would approve of.  We wanted to do more movies, and we were talking about opening a casino in Las Vegas [Nevada].  We'd gotten the license for the casino.  And at the time, I think BET was trading at like thirty-five dollars a share.  And the board thought that that price was too low, that the market wasn't giving us full value for everything the company was doing, and that that price would continue to take a hit when we announced we were going into the movie-making business and the casino business.  So, Bob [Robert L.] Johnson [founder of BET] and John Malone decided to take the company private, to allow us to grow some more.
Speaker 2: So, you bought back shares?
Speaker 1: Bought back all the shares.
Speaker 2: And this is another major project then, buying back shares?
Speaker 1: It was.  And that took about a year (laughter), to get the company ready to go then.  Because going private is, can be as--more difficult than going public, because you have to create a special committee of the board.  You have to negotiate with that special committee in terms of what the share price will be, because investors want a premium to sell their shares back.  You have to make sure, again, all the legal issues are resolved and all, everything's done correctly.  And in this case, the shareholders that were buying back the shares were Liberty Media, Bob Johnson, and myself.  I owned about two percent of the company.  And so, at this time I was COO [chief operating officer].  And so, it was a difficult process.  We only had one board member who qualified for the special committee (laughter).  That was Dell Lewis.  He was the only board member who was considered independent.  Well, Denzel [Washington] was independent too, but he didn't have time.  And he didn't, he had just come on the board.  So, I didn't think he--he didn't think he knew enough about the company.  So, it was just Dell Lewis, Goldman-Sachs--some other law firms were involved and, you know, they had to make sure that there was a fair price given for the shares.  So, I think stock was trading at thirty-five, and Liberty Media offered forty-eight dollars to buy back the shares, which was a good premium.  But we ended up at about sixty-three dollars before the deal was done, after--
Speaker 2: Did you have a shareholder suit brought against you?
Speaker 1: Several.
Speaker 2: Several.
Speaker 1: Yes. (laughter)
Speaker 2: Is that how the price went from forty-eight to sixty [dollars]--?
Speaker 1: That may have been part of it.  No, well, look--the bigger part of it was the negotiation with the special committee, and the fairness opinion from Goldman [Sachs], and dealing with all the consultants.  You know, my understanding is whenever you do this, you have shareholder suits.  So, the day we announced it, you know, three or four--
Speaker 2: (Unintelligible).
Speaker 1: Yeah, right.  So, they were settled as part of this.  But--
Speaker 2: So, now, tell me the year that this all happened again?
Speaker 1: This is 1998.
Story_ID: 56878
Speaker 1: So, 1998, you're [Black Entertainment Television (BET)] once again a private company?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And you're engaged in all different kinds of businesses?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And you're the chief operating officer [COO]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So, tell me what happens next in your career during this time period at BET.
Speaker 2: Well, we're--tried to build a casino.  Bob [Robert L. Johnson] was licensed individually to own a casino license.  That took about two years to get him qualified.  I spent a lot of time in Las Vegas [Nevada].  What else was going on?  We got into the movie business.  You know, we made a couple of movies.  And all of a sudden, we get a call that Sumner Redstone might be interested in acquiring BET.  And so, Bob and I went to talk to Sumner Redstone and Mel Karmazin--
Speaker 1: At Viacom?
Speaker 2: Viacom.  And Mel Karmazin was the COO of Viacom at the time.  And at the time, Bob Johnson was actually looking for an investor in BET.  Great American Broadcasting, or Taft [Broadcasting]--I failed to mention them before, had sold their shares when we went public.  So, they were out.  I think when we went private, HBO sold all their shares, because they had just done--Time Warner had just merged with AOL.  So, they sold all their shares.  So, the only investor we had at this point was Liberty Media.  And Bob thought it would be a good idea to have another investor.  So, we went and talked to Viacom, and to see if they were interested in buying a piece of the company.  And we met with Sumner and Mel Karmazin and they said, Sumner said very clearly, "I don't invest in companies.  I either buy them entirely, or I'm not interested."  And Bob said, "Well, I'm not interested in selling the whole company.  So, thank you very much, nice conversation."  And we came back to Washington [District of Columbia].  So, that process had so intrigued Bob that we then went out to Sun Valley to talk to other media companies about whether they would be interested in investing in BET.  We wanted a programming company to help us on the programming side.  So, we talked to Disney; we talked to Diventi; we talked to, you know, Murdoch News Corp.  And no one else was interested.  Everyone had their own issues going on at the same time.  Either they were part of a merger, or whatever.  So, no one else was interested.  So, the more we thought about it, we said "Well, maybe Viacom is really a viable alternative.  So, let's go back and talk to Viacom."  And you know, by that point, Bob had decided that it may be a good idea to sell the whole company.
Story_ID: 56879
Speaker 1: What were your [Black Entertainment Television (BET)] revenues looking like at that point? (Simultaneous)
Speaker 2: You know, I have no idea.
Speaker 1: When you first, when you first started at BET, you're in ten million homes.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: You're certainly above the thirty, forty million home point at this point.
Speaker 2: Oh, by this time, we were in eighty million homes.  Yeah, we were--
Speaker 1: Huge growth.
Speaker 2: Yeah, huge growth.  You know, our revenues were probably close to two hundred million [dollars] a year--maybe a hundred million from ad revenue, a hundred million from affiliate revenue.  So, we were growing, we were still growing.  And, you know, we had been private for about two years and, you know, were very happy.  And the thought was at some point we would go public again.  You know, we would get things--
Speaker 1: What was your vision for the company?  Did you want it to be known as the number one programmer for African Americans?  The number one provider of news and information?  What is it you wanted your market to be?
Speaker 2: Right.  We wanted to be the largest African American media company in the world.  And we wanted to be in any business that was related to that, or even closely related to it (laughter).  I mean, you could argue clothing line, credit card--some of these things weren't really media related.  But we just thought we had the best brand in the black arena, and that our audience trusted us, and that we could do anything with it.  So, our idea was how, you know, how do we keep growing?  Are there other cable networks?  Are there other businesses?  So, at the time Viacom was talking about acquiring us, I think we had like twelve or thirteen subsidiaries by then.  We were in a lot of, we had a Caribbean lottery company (laughter) that was going.  You know, just all kind of different things.  So, the question is how do you keep growing?  You know, but we knew we didn't want to just be a cable network.  We didn't want to become satisfied with where we were.  We wanted to keep growing.  And so, Viacom, you know, finally made us an offer that we couldn't refuse, and told us that they were supportive of the brand, that they believed in our audience and our demographic, and they wanted to help make us better.  They didn't want to just buy the real estate, buy the subscribers, turn us into something else.  And so, that was 2000.  And in November of 2000, I think, we announced that Viacom was going to acquire us.
Story_ID: 56880
Speaker 1: Can I go back a little bit before--
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: --before the Viacom acquisition [of Black Entertainment Television (BET)].  And that is, you had some challenges going on during this time from the public, complaining about the programming, BET programming.  And can you just talk a little bit about, you know, what the BET perspective was, I think, we have during Coretta Scott King's funeral.  I think you got complaints.  Or is that later?
Speaker 2: Oh, that was a little later.
Speaker 1: That was a little later?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Prior to that--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --about some of the rap music.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: What sort of complaints are starting to roll in?
Speaker 2: Well, there were two things--two major complaints, in terms of our programming.  One, our audience never understood why we weren't like NBC or CBS.  They never understood--a lot of people didn't understand that cable revenue was smaller.  And so, we didn't have a lot to invest in programming.  And you know, Bob [Robert L. Johnson; founder of BET] was of the feeling he didn't want to get trapped in that, "Well, I got to spend a lot of money on high programming costs," because then you couldn't run a business.  So, that was always kind of simmering, you know.  People are like, "Well, why are you acquiring shows from the networks?"  You know, "Why are you only doing music videos?"  Now, early on music videos weren't a bad thing, because there were Earth, Wind and Fire, and Aretha Franklin (laughter), and it was all R&B [rhythm and blues].  Over time, music videos became more hip-hop oriented, and more rap.  And they, it came with its own set of issues.  You know, the messages, the violence--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --the, you know, views toward women.  So, over time, BET became a lightning rod for that.  You know, they didn't focus on the artists or the music labels.  It was all BET's fault, because we were showing the videos.  And at that time we were showing--you know, 60 to 70 percent of our programming was videos, because it low-cost programming, and it was working.  You couldn't get videos anywhere else.  So, but, you know in terms of programming and mix of programming, we weren't that different from other cable networks.  We weren't that different from MTV [Music Television], or from USA Network, that had all re-runs.  Our audience just always wanted more from us.  So, as the issues around hip-hop became more polarized--and that was really led by the ruckus about the Rutgers' [University, New Brunswick, New Jersey] basketball--
Speaker 1: The Imus--
Speaker 2: --women's team--
Speaker 1: Don Imus--
Speaker 2: The Don Imus comments.  And that was much later.  But as a result of that, you know--his feedback, his comments were, "Well, you know, if I can't call black women the 'B' word, why can rappers do it?"  And then there was this bigger outcry about music and the images.  And so, over time, you know, we had to deal with that, and really decide where we were going on a content basis and what we wanted BET to be.  But this was pretty much after Bob Johnson had left BET.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, there was a lot of time in-between those two things--
Story_ID: 56881
Speaker 1: --when we [Black Entertainment Television (BET)] did the deal with Viacom, Bob [Robert L. Johnson] and I both signed five-year contracts, and stayed on.  And the whole management team stayed on, and--
Speaker 2: When you did the deal with Viacom, I mean, prior to that, I think there were a few protests about programming on BET.  But then you did the deal with Viacom, and then people were upset that you were selling a black network--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --to--.  Did you feel, how did you feel about--how were you supposed to keep the black community happy when on the one hand they're saying how can you sell, but on the other hand, you're not serving us?
Speaker 1: Right, very confused. (laughter)  You know, it was almost like there was no way we could win.  They wanted BET to stay black-owned.  If Bob was going to sell, they wanted--you know, there were people that said, "Why didn't you sell to Magic Johnson or Denzel [Washington] or somebody like that?"  Well, the price that Viacom paid for BET was three billion dollars.  So, there weren't a lot of black people walking around with three billion dollars.  Then the question after Viacom bought us, "Well, are they going to make the programming decisions?  Because we don't want BET to be run by white people."  So, Viacom promised they would not do that.  But then the question was, "Well, why aren't the resources Viacom--why aren't the resources that Viacom can now invest in BET--why is that not changing the programming fast enough?  You know, now you should be like CBS, now you should be like NBC."  Well, again, we were still a cable network.  We were investing, you know, like everybody else--not a lot, and trying to grow advertising revenue.  So, over time, you know, I knew we would get there.  It was just a question of whether we would get there fast enough for the black community.
Story_ID: 56882
Speaker 1: Now, so you're at Viacom.  And after the acquisition, Bob [Robert L. Johnson, founder of Black Entertainment Television (BET)] remains the CEO [chief executive officer] for a while, right?
Speaker 2: Five years.
Speaker 1: Five years?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And your position is?
Speaker 2: COO [chief operating officer].
Speaker 1: COO.
Speaker 2: I'm still chief operating officer.
Speaker 1: So, tell me about your life as the chief operating officer of now BET that's being, you know, owned by Viacom?
Speaker 2: Right.  Well, my life pretty much changed quite a bit.  I had to now deal with the Viacom corporate structure.  Bob didn't want to deal with that so much, so I got to deal with it.  And you know, but the good news is they left us alone in terms of programming decisions and direction of the network.  You know, but then we had to get used to their financial systems, their legal system.  We had to become a division of a larger company.  So, that took a while.  But overall, you know, it worked out really well.  It's nice to be part of a bigger company that was supportive, that could--you know, I could call up the head of MTV Networks and say, "How do you do this?"  Or, I could call Paramount [Pictures], and say, "How do you do this?"  So, it gave us a little bit of protection.  It gave us a lot more leverage in terms of dealing with advertisers and cable operators, so that was great.  And around that time, you know, Bob was thinking about leaving.
Story_ID: 56883
Speaker 1: And we missed a very critical part of your life, too.  A second child was being born.
Speaker 2: Oh, that's right.
Speaker 1: (Unintelligible) [Ava].
Speaker 2: That's right.  She was born in 1993, so, awhile before the Viacom deal.  So, I was dealing with--you know.
Speaker 1: And around the Viacom deal, your father [Richard McLeash Lee] is ill around this time.  Is that correct?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: And does he--?
Speaker 2: Well, my father actually passed away in 1998.  So, before the Viacom deal.
Speaker 1: So, he does not--
Speaker 2: He was sick around the time I became COO [chief operating officer].
Speaker 1: So he, he does not live to see you--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --move.  What is his impression--he's seen you go from Steptoe [& Johnson LLP] to BET [Black Entertainment Television].  What was his impression about the mushrooming of your career and the growth of BET?
Speaker 2: He was very proud.  You know, he became a big BET supporter.  So, he was very proud.  He saw a lot of the growth.  Unfortunately, he had Alzheimer's [disease], so by the time I was named Chief Operating Officer, you know, he wasn't quite here anymore.  I remember him thinking I had been elected to something.  I said, "Well, it wasn't really an election, Dad, it was an appointment." (laughter)  So, but he was very proud and, you know, he did see some of the success.  And he got to meet both of his grandchildren and was able to see them grow up, to a certain extent.
Speaker 1: So, we're going to return to you being the COO of Viacom, and your father's still--
Speaker 2: BET, as part of Viacom (laughter).
Speaker 1: BET.  Sumner [Redstone] is still in his position.
Speaker 2: Yes, as is--well, [Melvin "Mel"] Karmazin?  It may have been--
Speaker 1: Karmizan at that time.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and it eventually became Tom Freston.   And then eventually, it became Philippe Dauman.  So, I've had three supervisors, or managers, or COOs at [Viacom]--.
Story_ID: 56884
Speaker 1: Your next move at BET [Black Entertainment Television (BET)] is then to become the head of the whole organization.  Is that correct?
Speaker 2: CEO [chief executive officer], yes.  That happened in 1995 when Bob [Robert L. Johnson] left.
Speaker 1: That's a big step.  Tell us about that.
Speaker 2: Well, it wasn't so much of a big step, because I had been COO [chief operating officer] for ten years (laughter).  So, I was training for a long time.  So, and you know when Bob appointed me as COO, it was clear that he was planning his exit.  There was no, you know, mistake about it.  He had appointed me to become his successor.  Now, it was a question of, you know, when he would leave the company.  But, so, by the time he left in 1995 [2005?], I had been running the company for a long time.  You know, in a weird kind of way, because I still had someone reported to.  In addition to Viacom, Bob was still here as CEO.  So, he could always overrule me or, you know, change a decision.  But for the most part, he was out of the day-to-day operations.  So, when he left in 1995, it was not that big a change, even though I felt almost immediately that, you know, I had to now implement my vision and decide where I wanted to take BET.  And then, I didn't have that safety valve.  You know, I couldn't blame things on Bob, I couldn't (laughter), ask his advice.  So, it was a little different.  But I already had relationships with the people at Viacom.  I had been, you know, everyone had been reporting to me for about ten years.  So, it wasn't, it wasn't as big a change as when I took over as COO.  That was a bigger change.  By then, by the time Bob left, I knew the company really well.  You know, I had been involved all the major decisions and operations.  So, I pretty much had been groomed.
Speaker 1: What was your vision for the company at that time?
Speaker 2: Well, that was an interesting question.  Because when I took over, I didn't really have a vision (laughter).  I had to come up with one, because as COO you implement someone else's vision.  So, I had done that for so long.  So, the first thing I decided--and I guess I kind of started this before Bob left--.  But that we had to become a great content company; that there were more platforms.  International was becoming important. Our audience was demanding more, and that we really needed to beef up our content and do more original programming.  So, that was my first priority.
Story_ID: 56885
Speaker 1: So, you were saying that your vision for BET [Black Entertainment Television] at this time, one of your visions, is you want original programming?
Speaker 2: Right.  And you know, I would say the first one--I remember Bob [Robert L. Johnson] giving me the advice, "Don't ruin the business model." (laughter)  So, that's really the first thing I wanted to do--keep the business growing, and keep the business focused.  But at the same time, I wanted to create more original programming, which I knew would increase our costs.  And so we, you know, we had to take baby steps before we could really get where I wanted to be.  So, I hired our first head of programming from Hollywood, (laughter) someone who had been a Hollywood producer, a guy by the name of Reggie Hudlin.  So, that was my big step.  You know, we'd never had anyone who knew the creative community, who had, you know, done movies and TV shows.  So, that made a big statement.  I think for the first time we hung out the sign that said, "Open for Business."  You know, we want people to bring us ideas.  Before then, we did everything internally.
Speaker 1: Have you gotten around to all the businesses--the restaurant, the casinos, the publishing, and all of that?
Speaker 2: Yes.  When Viacom acquired us, they said we only want the companies that are making money (laughter), and the ones related to media.  So, everything else, they spun off to Bob Johnson personally.  So, the magazines were gone and the restaurants were gone, everything was gone.  So, the only thing that was left was BET, BET on Jazz, BET.com, BET International--you know, all the companies that were really close to the core.  So, that made life a little easier.  There was less, you know, to manage.  And so, and then the other thing is we were able to invest in programming.  You know, when we had all these other companies, a lot of the money was going into running these other companies.  So, we didn't have as much to invest in programming.   We wanted BET to continue to grow but, you know, we weren't investing large sums.  So, when I took over, it was at the point where we could start investing.  Viacom understood the business, they understood the need to invest in original content.  So, they were very supportive.  So, we went from, you know, very cheap music videos to, you know, our first sit-coms and reality shows.  Reality shows were the bridge to get us there.  And reality was very popular in TV in general, and it was less expensive than scripted sit-coms and dramas.  So, we did reality shows.  And you know, we focused on getting our ratings up.  And around about that time is when the protest over hip-hop music started.  So, I had protesters in front of my house for about seven months.
Speaker 1: With bullhorns.
Speaker 2: With bullhorns, who decided I was the picture of the hip-hop--
Speaker 1: I think they called you "Debra Leevil"?
Speaker 2: Oh, I think that was the guy from Boondocks who did a, one of his shows about BET.  Yeah, he called me Debra Leevil, or something.
Speaker 1: Debra Leevil, I remember that.
Speaker 2: Yeah, you know, had a little animal that--.   Anyway, (laughter) you live and learn.  But, a minister from Olney, Maryland decided that I was the face of hip-hop, and that he would bus his congregation down to my house in Washington, D.C. [District of Columbia] every Saturday for two hours and march up and down in front of my house and protest that we were showing hip-hop videos.  And you know, the thing that I really could never get my mind around is that he wanted to select the videos that we showed.  And he wanted to tell me (laughter)--which, you know, when he first started protesting, he had three videos he didn't like.  And then by the end, he had, you know, a couple more.  And I was like, "Well, you know, what you're basically saying is you want to run BET.  And I can't allow that to happen.  (laughter).  I'm running BET."  And so, we never agreed.
Story_ID: 56886
Speaker 1: But during that time, you know, I talked to a lot of people in the community.  We took a lot of advice, we talked to artists--and that's when we went through this branding strategy of, "Who is BET [Black Entertainment Television]?  What do we want it to be?"  You know, being black--being a black network is not enough, because there are a lot of other people.  We now have competition, there are other black networks.  You know, media companies are doing black programs or Black Nights.  So, we really had to dig deep and figure out who we were.  And that took about a year and a half, locking up executives, saying what are our values?  What does our audience want from us?  Doing more focus groups, doing more research.  And we came out with this strategy that said, you know, our programming is going to respect, reflect and elevate our audience.  Those are the three things we're going to do.  And if the programming we're looking at doesn't do that, we shouldn't be doing it, because our audience doesn't want it from us.  You know, I used to think that BET carried this burden, that we couldn't just be a television network.  The people, the black community, expected us to solve their problems, to inspire them, to do more than what they expected from other networks.  And then going through this branding process I realized, you know what?  That's not a burden, that's a passion.  You know, our audience cares so much about what we do.  And if we give it to them, they're going to be there.  They're going to be loyal.  You know, our ratings are going to do better.  And during that time, I hired a new head of programming (laughter) and someone who was more attuned to what I was trying to do.  And, you know, it all worked out.  We started sit-coms.  So, we had to get away from the reality programming, because reality was train wreck reality sometimes.  And you know, our audience would criticize us.  They don't criticize other networks when they do it, but they would criticize us.  So, we've kind of found our sweet spot of what our audience wanted, being able to do high quality programming.  And the first major sit-com I green-lit was 'The Game', which was a show that was on the CW.  CW cancelled it.  The audience reached out to BET and said, please bring it back.  It took us about two years to do the deal with CBS, but we were eventually able to bring it back.  And now, it's a huge success for us.  The night of premiere, we got 7.7 million viewers.  It's the highest rated sit-com in cable TV history.  And so, we were able to prove that if we give our audience high quality content, they will show up.  They will support BET, they will love BET, and they will watch BET.
Story_ID: 56887
Speaker 1: Let me ask you this on a personal note.  Going back to your Greensboro [North Carolina] days in high school [James P. Dudley High School], I recall you telling us how, you know, you didn't want to integrate that school.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: You were proud of being black, and black people didn't need white people to make them feel like they were smart or accomplished.  And then you fast forward to a point in your career where you, you know, you had [The] Boondock[s], you know, saying--
Speaker 2: (laughter).
Speaker 1: --you had Boondock--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --Aaron [McGruder], I forgot his last name, but--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --saying that, you know, you're Debra Leevil.  She's evil towards black people--
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: You have the minister protesting--
Speaker 2: Yes, Lord.
Speaker 1: --in front of your house with bullhorns.  You've got noise being made on the Hill about--Capitol Hill--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --about BET [Black Entertainment Television] programming.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: How is this affecting you personally?  Because you have always been involved from a civil rights perspective--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --wanting to have black people being seen--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --in the best light.  How does that influence your decision process--
Speaker 2: Right--
Speaker 1: --for the next vision of BET?
Speaker 2: Well, it was, it was very hurtful.  You know, here I am, a Harvard [Law School] educated lawyer who I, I thought I was pretty smart.  And I was like I should be able to figure this out.  Because one, I want to serve my audience.  Two, I want to give them great images.  And, three, you know, I want to run a successful business.  There should be a way to do this.  And I didn't want--also, the legal training in me came out.  I didn't want to restrict First Amendment rights.  I didn't want to be in the business of telling young artists what they could and could not do.  And I felt very strongly about that, and I was willing to fight for that.  You know, I might not like all the lyrics; I might not like the images.  But I remember when I was in high school, my mother [Delma Louise Taylor Lee] didn't like the lyrics I listened to (laughter).  And she didn't like the music.  You know, so, I knew there was an age issue.  I knew there was a generational issue.  And I thought there was a First Amendment right issue.  And on the other hand, I didn't want my company, BET, to be the main focal point.  You know, I didn't think that was fair at all.  We weren't creating the videos, (laughter) we were just putting them on.  But at a certain amount, a certain point, you have to take responsibility for that.  And I think what I--after going through the protestors and the discussions with the record labels, who did not want to stand up and be in the forefront of this fight, I was very disappointed in that.  I'm like, "I'm the one fighting for your artists' First Amendment rights, and you won't come to a hearing on Capitol Hill and stand with me and take the flak?  You know, Philippe Dauman has to go up there and explain the lyrics to the music that you're producing?"  So, I felt betrayed by the music industry that they didn't stand up for us.  Not one artist came to my house and stood and looked at those protestors in seven months, not one.  You know, whenever I'd run into them they were really huggy and supportive, but not one of them showed up.  Not one of them would--I had to beg Nelly.  We did a show on hip-hop in America, where I said, "Okay, let's talk about it on the air.  You know, this is an issue in our community, let's talk about it.  We're going to bring the artists, we're going to bring the feminists, we are going to bring the religious leaders and bring Michael Eric Dyson (laughter).  We're going to bring everyone together--Al Sharpton.  Let's talk about it."  Nelly was the only rapper I could convince to come.  And he did it as a personal favor to me, but he didn't want to do it.  And I was like, "Well, why am I the one here taking the grief for you all, if you won't come and stand up for your own rights?"
Story_ID: 56888
Speaker 1: So, the issue that, the conclusion that I came to over time as we went through this brand strategy--.  And I thought about what I wanted for the black community.  And what I wanted BET [Black Entertainment Television] to represent is one, I'm not going to stop the music industry from creating the music.  I'm not going to stop them from creating the videos.  I can't stop young people from listening to it, but their First Amendment right doesn't mean I have to put it on BET.  (laughter)  You know, it's my network.  I had to finally say it's my network, and I have to make the decision of what's going to go on.  So, I'm not hurting their First Amendment right, they can do it.  They've got the internet.  (laughter)  If young people want to go see the latest Kanye [West] video that I won't play on the network, they can do it on the internet.  You know, I'm not the only distribution mechanism.  So, I got rid of my fear about, you know, censorship.  And then on the programming side, after we came up with the brand strategy, you know, I was able to say I'm not going to do that program, I'm not going to do that one.  That's not what I'm going to do.  That's not what BET's going to do.  Now, if somebody else wants to do it, and it becomes a hit on their show, God bless them.  You know, I'm happy for them.  But you know, I'm not going to feel pressured that I'm in a ratings game.  And that means I have to create content that I'm not proud of.  I'm just not going to play that game anymore.  And so, we started making decisions on, you know, what we as a team like.  I'm like, I've got this group of black executives (laughter), some of the smartest people I know, the best team in the industry, and we're not even watching BET.  So, you know, all of a sudden in going through the whole process, it just became clear that, you know, we have to be responsible for our own decisions.  And I'm convinced we can find good quality programming that our audience will flock to.  And we proved that with 'The Game' [sitcom], 'Let's Stay Together', and the other kind of programming we're doing now.  And that's not to say everything we put on the air is going to be positive, or we're the black PBS and (laughter)--.  You know, it's heady stuff.  You know, we're still an entertainment network.  We're still going to do programming directed to our audience.  But if there are negative images or people have problems, we're going to give them solutions.  You know, we're not going to do extreme stuff just to get ratings.  We're going to tell real life stories, and hope our audience comes.  And if they stop coming, you know, we need to get in another business.  But I think we're at a point where our ratings are higher than ever in our thirty-two-year history.  People are, you know, coming up to me in the streets saying they love BET and they love the changes.  They're feeling good about the network, and we're just in a much better place.
Story_ID: 56889
Speaker 1: You did your soul-searching, and it brought you to this place.  But during all this time that the controversies were going on, you [Black Entertainment Television (BET)] had competitors that were entering the fray.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: You had TV One--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --Nu TV.  What was the one, Gary--Willie Garrison and Marlon Jackson--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: --The Black Family.
Speaker 2: Black Family, was that Black Family?  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Black Family.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: All of these--
Speaker 2: Robert Townsend.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Robert Townsend.  Yeah, the Black Family Network.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And they were all going to be the anti-BET.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: But those competitors no longer exist, with the exception of perhaps Radio One.
Speaker 2: TV One, right.
Speaker 1: TV One, I'm sorry, TV One.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: How did BET beat out all those competitors?  What do you think your secret was?
Speaker 2: It was finding our strategy, sticking to it, producing high quality programming, and assembling the best management team I could.  And continuing to find the best executives and employees, and staying true to who we are.  And, you know, the good news is we had a head start on a lot of people (laughter).  And it's not as easy as it looks.  Running a 24-hour network is harder than it looks--and finding enough programming to fill 24 hours.  Then we started Centric, which is more of a competitor with those new entrants.  You know, BET was so far along in its history.  I wouldn't say they were competitors to BET, but we were trying to start a second network which was BET on Jazz, which turned into BET J, which is now Centric.  And Centric's doing well.  So, I think it's really focusing on what we do, and not worrying about the competition.  Everybody has competition.  This is a competitive industry, and I tell my team that all the time.  If you're worried about competition, this is not the industry to be in.  We're not a monopoly.  And even when there was no other black network, we were still competing against every other network.  We're competing against the internet; we're competing against movies--.  And you know, you have a hit one day, and the next week they won't know what you've done lately.  You know, it's just the way this business is.  And you can get sidetracked by, "Oh, my God we have competition," or "Oh, my God," you know, "Bravo has a black show on Thursday night."  We just have to be better.  And we have to market better, we have to produce content that our audience wants to see.  I mean, one of the things I'm proudest about, I'm proud of how our ratings have grown since I've been CEO [chief executive officer].  But like this year, even during the NBA [National Basketball Association] finals--.  You know, NBA finals can eat our lunch (laughter) because our audience is such basketball fans.  But this year, even though the finals were as competitive as always and actually got their highest ratings, we maintained our ratings, and you know, and didn't fall back. You know, we counter-programmed and put on the best shows we could.  And movies and stunts and, you know, we're holding our own.  So, you can't be afraid of competition.  It's the nature of this business and, you know, we just keep doing what we do, and try to do it better and better every year.
Story_ID: 56890
Speaker 1: So, as you sit here today--when you started with the company [Black Entertainment Television (BET)], you had ten million subscribers?
Speaker 2: Uh huh.
Speaker 1: And what are you, about 400 million now?
Speaker 2: On BET, the network, we're at close to a hundred million.  Then we probably have thirty or forty million internationally.  And then we have about fifty million on Centric.
Speaker 1: When you walked out of Steptoe [& Johnson LLP], did you have any vision that you'd end up sitting here, you know, as CEO [chief executive officer] of BET with a subscriber base of a hundred million?
Speaker 2: No, I had no idea.  I had no idea what I'd be doing, you know, 26 years later.  It's been an amazing experience and a great ride.  And you know, I'm still having fun doing it.  So--
Speaker 1: What is your vision for the continuation of BET in the sense that BET is, you know, led by Debra Lee.  At some point, Debra Lee is going to want to do something else.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Or someone else--.  What do you, you know, what do you want the legacy of this BET to be?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I want it to be an institution in the black community that lasts forever.  And I think Bob [Robert L. Johnson] made the first step toward that when he appointed me as COO [chief operating officer].  He said I'm not going to be here forever.  I need to have a professional manager who's able to replace me and take BET to the next level.  When I leave BET, I need to have someone who can step into my shoes and take it to the next level.  I want it to continue to be an important cultural force in our community, that young black kids can grow up seeing themselves in all different kind of images on one network.  And hopefully more than one--with Centric--and maybe we'll start some more.  I'd love to do more networks.  But you know, it's important to build a management team and to make BET Networks into a permanent institution.  I remember Bob made us read a book called 'Built to Last.'  It was a management book about, you know, making a company strong enough to live through CEOs and founders.  And that's what I want BET to be.  I want it to be a loved brand, a beloved brand in the black community.  And, I want other people to come and watch, you know--what we call lovers of black culture, whether they be white, Latino, Asian, whatever.  And we're having a lot of success in that area.  I want it to go around the world.  We're growing internationally.  We just launched in about four more African countries.  We have 14 million subscribers in the U.K.--we're on BSkyB [British Sky Broadcasting].  So, I want it to be a brand that goes around the world.  So, there's a lot more to do.  And I want it to be--I want BET to be a place where our creative community comes first, where they're proud of the work we do, they know we're going to treat their projects right, and they know we're going to tell our story the best.  And you know, we're starting to feel that, that people are coming to us first.  They're not saying, "Oh, my God, HBO turned me down, NBC turned me down.  Now, I want to go to BET."  They're like, "Let's go to BET first.  You know, they get it.  They're going to treat us right, and you know, we're proud of what they're putting out."  So, it's an exciting time, and it's a lot more to do.  My kids [Quinn and Ava] are grown now (laughter).  They've launched their lives.  So, it's, it's phase two.  You know, my youngest went to college, Ava went to college this year.  And now, you know, I can do more things.
Story_ID: 56891
Speaker 1: Now, you have always done more things besides BET [Black Entertainment Network].
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Talk a little bit about that.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You've been actively involved in political things--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --with the president [President Barack Obama].  You've been actively involved in programs for young women and girls.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Talk a little bit about that.
Speaker 2: Well, you know, I've always felt it's important to give back.  And whether that's through Girls, Inc. or the Grammy Foundation or Alvin Ailey, I try to find organizations that I'm committed to, that give our young people a better chance.  And so, you know, I've always been committed personally, and BET provides a great outlet to do that, whether it's 'BET Goes Pink' and we're doing things on breast cancer, or our 'Wrap It Up' program with AIDS and HIV.  So, it's always how can we help our community, and how can we give back?  So, I've been involved in philanthropic things.  I also am on three corporate boards.  You know, it's been a good experience for me to find out how other companies work.  And to see how, you know, CEOs [chief executive officers] run other companies--to help them with their business, to help them understand my audience, and marketing to my audience.  So, that's been great.  And you know, I've always been a political junkie.  I've always liked policy work.  That's what I thought I would do.  I haven't done that full-time, but I do it, you know, through working with the National Cable Association, lobbying on the Hill [Capitol Hill].  I'm on the president's Management Advisory Board, which is a group of CEOs that give the president advice on how to run government better.  That's been a lot of fun, and very eye-opening.  So, it's been fun to be in [Washington] D.C. during this administration and, you know, to get the call every now and then and be able to answer it, and to help this president.  I've lived in D.C. thirty-two years now, so I've seen a lot of presidents come and go.  And you know, I think everyone knows I'm a Democrat, so I'm more supportive of the Democratic administrations.  But, I've tried to be supportive of whoever is president, and find ways to help through the policy front.  So, as my son [Quinn] said when I was appointed to the president's Management Advisory Board, I finally get to use that [Harvard] Kennedy School [of Government] (laughter) diploma [M.A. in Public Policy].  He said, "Oh, you use your public policy degree."  So, that's been a lot of fun.  But it's an exciting time to be in Washington.  You know, and--
Speaker 1: Any chance you'd run for a public office?
Speaker 2: No, no chance I would run for public office (laughter).  I don't know why anyone would run for public office these days.  (laughter)  I mean it's one of the most dangerous things you could do.  You know, would I take an appointed office?  I don't know.  I'm having too much fun doing what I do now.  I like my view of the White House, which isn't very good from here, but it's close enough.  And you know, there may be other things I want to do down the line.  But I'm really happy doing what I'm doing now, and I think there's just so much growth for BET Networks.  So, you know, that's my main focus.
Story_ID: 56892
Speaker 1: So, Toni Morrison in her book, 'What Moves at the Margin'--she writes--and this is just part of her Nobel [Prize] speech.  "Tell us what the world has been to you in the dark places and in the light.  Tell us what it has been, tell us what it is to be a woman, so that we may know what it is to be a man.  What moves at the margin?  What is it to have no home in this place, to be set adrift from the one you knew?  What is it to live at the edge of a town that cannot bear your company?"  Okay, that's the first quote.  And that I take is her impression of African American existence in the United States.  And a little later on, she talks about--she writes an essay, and she talks about how her grandmother and grandfather saw the progression of racism.  And she says that her grandfather says there would be no progress basically--that two steps forward, one step backward.
Speaker 2: Oh, really, wow.
Speaker 1: But her grandmother says, "It's like a slow march of trees."  And she describes this set of trees that are moving up the plain, and there's this slow gradual progress towards permanent progress.  So, my question is--from the Nobel speech that she gave, sort of this view of a people without a home.  And then from this one, it's like a slow walk of progress.  You moved from Greensboro [North Carolina], a very segregated environment, to being in a sense in a pinnacle of power here at BET [Black Entertainment Television].  How do you see the progress that we've made?
Speaker 2: Well, I see that we've made a lot of progress.  And I have been very fortunate to see that progress up close and personal in my own life, and then as an observer of our world through the eyes of BET Networks.  You know, sometimes I just have to pinch myself (laughter) at how wonderful my life has been.  And I never felt like an outsider, even when I was at segregated schools, because I had a home there.  When I went to Brown [University], maybe for a hot minute I felt like an outsider, but I eventually found my home there, and people that I had things in common with.  Through law school, coming to Washington [D.C.]--you know, I really feel like I found my way, in terms of what my life is about and how I'm going to give back.  And I must say the pinnacle of my life so far--and I've had a lot of high moments.  You know, from BET going private to--I mean going public [1991], to going private [1998].  You know, I could--and giving Smokey Robinson, my childhood idol,  Diana Ross, who I wanted to be like when she was with the Supremes, you know, being able to give them awards and being in the atmosphere.  I mean, I've just had so many moments.  And I'm still experiencing them.  But I must say, being in Grant Park the night our first African American president [President Barack Obama] was elected was just the most incredible moment, and I think so much evidence of how far we've come.  Because up until that point, I think so many people still thought it was not possible.  I remember getting on the plane going to Chicago [Illinois] that day, thinking it was not possible (laughter).  But I said to myself, if it is possible, I want to be there.  But in the back of my mind--I remember going to vote that morning, and my daughter [Ava] walked with me to the voting place.  And after I voted for Barack Obama, I remember walking home and explaining to my daughter how sometimes even when you think things are going to work out, people move the rules.  They move the goal line, they change the rules.  You know, I was telling her about Clyde Ferguson, who was a professor of mine at Harvard Law School.  And how, you know, every year they take the top 25 students.  And the year he made it, he was number 25 for the Harvard Law Review.  And the year he made it, they made it 24, just so he couldn't be it.  I mean, that's not the exact story, but--.  And I remember explaining that to my daughter saying, "You know, don't be disappointed if he doesn't win tonight.  You know, we, everyone's worked hard on this.  It's possible, but you never know what's going to happen."  So, I got on that plane, I went to Chicago.  You know, I called a friend of mine.  I said, "Come on, go to Chicago with me.  I've got two tickets (laughter), and we'll be in Grant Park."
Story_ID: 56893
Speaker 1: So, I remember making up my mind, like eleven o'clock that morning [election morning in 2008]--I'm going to Chicago [Illinois], I don't care.  I got tickets, I'm going to go.  And I was up on, they had a podium, scaffolding, where they had the media companies.  So, the BET [Black Entertainment Television] news team wanted me to be come up and talk about what it was like to be in Grant Park.  And well, let me back up.  Before then, I went to a reception at the Four Seasons in Chicago that the campaign had put together.  And it was, you know, a lot of black folks who had been supportive of the president [President Barack Obama].  We were drinking champagne, just having a good time.  Still not, you know, I think--most of us not believing he would actually win.  But we were, you know, accepting.  And someone came and said, "You know, the returns are coming in.  It's going our way."  And we were like, "Really?"  (laughter)  And so, we all rushed over to Grant Park.  We were like, we'd better get over there quick.  And so, then they asked me to come up and talk to the BET news team.  And I was talking about what it was like and how, you know, everybody was so excited.  I'd just seen Oprah [Winfrey] and Gayle King and, you know, Reverend [Jesse] Jackson, and blah, blah, blah.  And I did my interview, and then Rick Wade, who worked for President Obama at the time--Senator Obama at the time--was doing his interview.  And I was standing there waiting for him, because he was the highest most ranking, you know, highest African- American working on the campaign.  So, I was going to walk him down.  While he was speaking, it was announced that Obama had won.  And both of us were just like, (laughter), "Really?" and it was like eleven o'clock at night, or ten o'clock in Chicago.  I mean, it was relatively early, you know.  We thought we were all going to go to bed and go through a [Al] Gore [2000 general elections]--you know, whoever that was who ran-[George W.] Bush thing--where you didn't know who won, whether the [U.S.] Supreme Court was going to steal it from us, even if--.  You know, we just all knew it was going to be that close, you know, where we would--.  And then when they called the election--and we were both standing.  And all we could see were all these people in Grant Park.  And they started cheering, and they started showing video from--I mean, it was the most incredible--.  And he was like, live on the air.  He was like looking at me and I was looking at him.  (laughter)  And we just could not believe it, still could not believe it.  So, I went down where everybody--where I had left my friends.  And you know, Obama comes out and speaks.  And I'm calling my kids [Quinn and Ava].  And my kids are like, "Yeah, of course we won."  Then I called my mother [Delma Louise Taylor Lee], and she's crying.  You know, she's like, "Oh, I never thought I'd see this in my lifetime."  So, I'm sitting there just amazed at the difference between my mother's attitude and my kids' attitude.  You know, my kids are like, "Well, of course he won.  You know, just because he's African American."  And their view of the world--and my mother who's eighty-four years old, saying I never thought I would live to see this day.  And I'm stuck somewhere in between the two (laughter).  You know, I'm with my mother--I never thought I'd live to see this day.  But I'm as hopeful as my kids, you know, which is why I worked for him.  Anyway, he comes out and he speaks.  And I'm standing next to Eric Holder and, you know, Reverend Jackson is--.  And everybody's just, you know, so emotional.  And my PR person was at home, and she wrote a statement from me to the company saying what an amazing time this was, and how important it was, and she actually summed up my life better than I could.  You know, I grew up in Greensboro [North Carolina]--.  And after I read that statement, that she wanted me to okay it so she could send it out the company, I just started boo-hooing, like a baby.  (laughter)  I mean, I'm standing in the middle of Grant Park saying, wow, this is what we've been fighting for all these years.  You know, isn't it incredible that I've lived to see this moment, and to be surrounded by all his supporters.  And it just, it--you know.  So, whenever I doubt that we've made progress, I pull up that moment that night and remind myself that we've still come a long way.  We have a long way to go and, you know, it's still a lot of issues and a lot of social things that need to be policies.  And you know, we've got to get him re-elected.  But that moment just shows me, you know, we have come a long way and that almost-- almost anything is possible, because that was just one thing.  You know, so many--even if you were a real supporter, you just really didn't--you didn't want to admit it (laughter), but deep in your heart you just didn't think it was possible.  Someone was going to rob us of that moment and rob him.  We didn't know how it was going to happen (laughter), but we knew that we had seen it too many times before.  And so, you know--.
Speaker 2: So, you had a little bit of Toni Morrison's grandfather in the back of your mind?
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: But you had the hope of the trees--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --reaching for--.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.  And I think that's important.  You know, we have to know--we've got to keep fighting and you know, no one's at the level we want people to be.  You know, there's still not enough female CEOs [chief executive officers] and not enough black women doing things.  You know, we could go on and on about the things we still have to fight for.  But we have made a lot of progress.  And, the thing that has struck me the most--maybe because I was born in 1954--is President Obama was elected fifty-four years after Brown versus Board of Education.  And who would have thought when that case was decided, that fifty-four years later we'd have the first African American President.  And a lot of it because he was allowed to go to the schools that Brown versus Board of Education opened up for us.
Story_ID: 56894
Speaker 1: And not many people have talked about that--have talked about how important that case [Brown vs. Board of Education, 1954]was, in opening access for black children to go to any school they want to go to, and that connection to the election of our first black president [President Barack Obama] and our First Lady [Michelle Obama].  You know, no one can take anything away from them, because you know, they went to Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts], they went to Columbia [University, New York City, New York], they went to Princeton [University, Princeton, New Jersey].  You know, no one in the--you know, that was never an issue, that someone could say, "Oh, well, you couldn't, you didn't go to the best schools.  You didn't compete with, you know, white people.  You didn't compete with the best of the best.  They both competed with the best of the best.  And now they're in the White House.  Now, they call them, you know, elitist (laughter).  Really, is that the best you can come up with, elitist?  Or they called him, you know, they called the president not black enough.  Really, that's the best you can come up with?  But no one could ever call them, you know, unprepared or uneducated.  And that had to be what those lawyers were thinking about, with Brown versus--.  As much as I fought against it when I was in high school, as much as I disagreed with my father [Richard McLeash Lee] over whether integration was the best way, I think Barack Obama and Michelle Obama are the best examples of how it was the right way to go.
Story_ID: 56895
Speaker 1: On a personal note, this is an opportunity for you to tell us, what do you want your personal legacy to be?  What, how do you, Debra Lee, want to be remembered?
Speaker 2: Well, I would say first of all I want to be remembered as a great mother.  That's very important to me.  A great businesswoman, that would be great.  I ran a great company [Black Entertainment Television (BET)], produced some great content, all the things that relate to your business world.  But I think, you know, what's really important to me and my legacy is hopefully improving the images of women--of black women in particular--of helping with the advancement of women, whether it's in the business world or professional world, political world--giving African Americans opportunities that they would not have with other companies, and being able to be a springboard for many careers.  And really just being a person who cared and wanted to give back and, you know, was proud of my history and where I came from.  And wanting to show that to the world, and to our viewers and give them a mirror that they're proud of.  So, I think that sums it up.  I'm sure I could think of a few more things (laughter), but--
Speaker 1: Thank you for sharing your stories with us.
Story_ID: 56896
Speaker 1: We have some pictures we'd like to, that we got from you.
Speaker 2: Oh really, wow.
Speaker 1: Yes, that we'd like to sort of show.
Speaker 2: [Off-Camera Conversation]
Speaker 1: Can you tell us about this picture?
Speaker 2: Okay, that is my mother, Delma [Louise Taylor] Lee, and my father, Major Richard [McLeash] Lee.  And that young girl is my sister, I think. (laughter)
Speaker 1: What's her name?
Speaker 2: Gretta Lee.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And do you know approximately when it was taken, or what the occasion was?
Speaker 2: I don't, I don't.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Before my time (laughter).  Oh, that is me and Dr. Dorothy Height [also a HistoryMaker].
Speaker 1: Okay.  What's the--?
Speaker 2: And the occasion was our first Leading Women Summit that we do every year at Dunbar High School.  We were mentoring young girls, and she came to speak right before she--
Speaker 1: And the approximate date?
Speaker 2: Three years ago so, right--and that's actually right before she passed away. Oh, that's from BET [Black Entertainment Television] Honors this year, 2012.  And these are two Tuskegee Airmen to the left, and I don't know their names, but we can get that for you.  We honored the Tuskegee Airmen that night. That's Beverly Kearney who was also honored.  She's a track coach from Texas. That's the First Lady, Michelle Obama, and that's me next to her.  And the next person is Mariah Carey, Stevie Wonder and Spike Lee.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Oh, wow, that is, oh, a fundraiser I had at my house at the end of 2011 for Terrie Williams Stay Strong Foundation, which is a foundation that focuses on mental health in the African American community.  That's Reverend Al Sharpton next to her.  I don't know who this is, but that's me and then those are two folks from Terrie's, the two gentlemen are from Terrie's Foundation.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That is me at the '08 [2008] BET Awards.  These are better pictures than I have.  That's Beyonce and me and my daughter, Eva Coleman.  And that was at a BET Awards several years ago. That is me and the Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, when I went over to the [U.S.] State Department to speak to their Black History Month Celebration.  That is me and Ruby Dee at our first pre-Black Girls Rock reception.  She was the honoree that year.  Oh, that is me in high school [James P. Dudley High School, Greensboro, North Carolina] working on the yearbook, I think.  That's a photo of me several years ago.  That's a photo of me around 1989.  I think was pregnant at that time.  That's a picture of me graduating from--where was I graduating from, what does that say?  (laughter)  Brown University?  I think Brown University, yeah, Brown University.  And that's my father and my mother.
Speaker 1: Okay, and their names?
Speaker 2: Richard Lee and Delma Lee.
Speaker 1: Okay.  How do you spell her name?
Speaker 2: D-E-L-M-A.
Speaker 1: Thank you.
Speaker 2: And that's me in nursery school in Germany.  I think I was four years old.  And that's me when I was graduating from Dudley High School in 1972.
Speaker 1: I guess that's it.
Speaker 2: Oh, good.  You have a great collection of photos.
Speaker 1: You know who we can thank for that, probably--
Speaker 2: Yeah, Bobbette.
Speaker 1: Bobbette.  Debbie, thank you so much.
Speaker 2: Thank you, oh, thank you.
