Story_ID: 1288
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now I, I'm going to ask you about your family history, and I'm going to ask about your father's side of the family and your mother's side.
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: We'll start with your mother's side first.  Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us please?
Speaker 2: Her name is Beatrice Jackson, and it's B-E-A-T-R-I-C-E Jackson, J-A-C-K-S-O-N.
Speaker 1: Now are you giving us her maiden name too?
Speaker 2: That's her married name.  Her, her maiden name is Bowie, B-O-W-I-E.
Speaker 1: B-O-W-I-E, okay, and what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: She was born in Louisiana, and she was born March 19th, 1929.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now where in Louisiana, do you know where?
Speaker 2: New Orleans.
Speaker 1: New Orleans, all right, okay.  Now what do you know about your mother's side of the family, about the ancestry on that side?  How far back can you trace that side of the family?
Speaker 2: My goodness.  I can trace it back to my great-great-grandmother Minerva, and she was born in slavery, but was a baby.  So she really couldn't talk too much or remember too much about slavery itself.  So that's about as far as I can go back with my family on my mother's side.  My great-grandmother Minerva.
Speaker 1: Okay now what's the family narrative I guess for that side of the family?  What, what happens from Minerva on down?
Speaker 2: From Minerva on.  Well it was kind of an interesting family.  It was, it was this communal, and this is the history that I've always learned is that everybody raised everyone's children.  Everybody--you know you didn't know who were the sisters, who were the cousins.  And they all basically stayed in Louisiana.  My grandfather, Gus Spencer, who was found by my great-grandmother's husband who saw him on the side of the road and he was born in Mississippi but he lost his family.  And he was raised by my great-grandparents.  And then my grandmother married him and they moved kind of into the north end of Louisiana.  And they divorced and then my mother, my grandmother married my step-grandfather, Anthony Bowie.  But again, it was still a family.  You didn't say stepfather, you didn't say step-grandfather because everybody was a grandmother, everybody was a grandfather.  And when Gus Spencer remarried, he married a woman by the name of Mary and she was a friend of my grandmother and they are--up until my grandmother's death, Mary remained a good friend.  And so my mom has all these half brothers, which she cringes every time I say the way half brothers and sisters because they were all one family.  On my father's side, which was very interesting, I remember--
Story_ID: 1289
Speaker 1: Now can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Yes, Alson, A-L-S-O-N Jackson.
Speaker 1: Okay and what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Place of birth, Louisiana.
Speaker 1: New Orleans too?
Speaker 2: No, Jonesboro-Hodge.
Speaker 1: Okay Jonesboro--
Speaker 2: Northern Louisiana.
Speaker 1: Hodge, with a hyphen, Hodge?
Speaker 2: H-O-D-G-E, so Jonesboro Hodge, cause the two towns (unclear) they merged together, hyphen between them, Jonesboro-Hodge.
Speaker 1: Okay and he was born what year?
Speaker 2: He was born May 21st, 1919.
Speaker 1: Twenty first, 1919, okay.
Speaker 2: And I can go back as far as his paternal grandmother, Grandma Lily who was Cherokee.  And she used to talk about the tribe.  Unfortunately as a young child, I really didn't understand it.  And I also remember Grandma Minny, his maternal grandmother.  And she always, again she was older.  She remembered slavery.  And when we, when I would go to visit her, she'd always talk about crossing the great water for freedom.  And she always talked about--
Speaker 1: What did she mean by that?
Speaker 2: There was a dividing line, particularly in Louisiana, and I think that if you got over the Mississippi River and you got past Texas, they saw that as a freedom, or an opportunity for freedom.  And that's what she meant by it, it was the slavery, and that's what her people, or her parents and so forth talked about.  And she used to sit -- and I remember her, her house which was across the street from my grandmother, from my aunt's house.  She didn't believe in wooden floors.  It was a dirt floor, but it was the cleanest floor in the world, and she would always sweep.  And she would always -- she couldn't see, but she knew all of her great-grandchildren by their voices.  And when I would come to visit, she would say oh, this must be one of my great-grandbabies from California.  She could tell by -- I don't know, however I spoke.  And that's what I remember about my great-grandmother on my father's side.  And Grandma Lily, I remember her talking about the tribe.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So she was a Cherokee.  That might indicate that she was from another part of the south before she came to Louisiana.
Speaker 2: Louisiana had a lot of Cherokee.  So you -- when you look at the Cherokee nation, it was in the south.  So --
Speaker 1: Okay.  I always see them as being in the Carolinas and you know --
Speaker 2: May be.  But I also heard that it was a pretty big population, or there was a population in Louisiana.
Speaker 1: Cause as we all know, they all were pushed west by the U.S. government at some point.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 1290
Speaker 1: Okay.  So well tell us a little bit about your mother's [Beatrice Jackson] growing up.  You know what, what was growing up like for her?  Did she talk about it?
Speaker 2: All the time.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Growing up for my mother, she was poor.  And she talked about from age six working in a five and dime store down in Jonesboro-Hodge, and working for a dressmaker.  Her mother was a domestic.  Her step-grandfather worked at the paper mill, which the paper mill was the biggest employer in Jonesboro-Hodge.  Somehow after my mom became about six or eight, they moved north into Jonesboro-Hodge where they met my parents, or my father's [Alson Jackson] people.  And so it, it was a struggle but education was very important.  So her mother would always save up all the money.  And my mom started to go to Grambling [State University, Grambling, Louisiana].  So that was a thing that was always important for my mother.  She -- I think if my mother had her choice, she would have stayed in Louisiana.  But she -- I mean she was quite a beautiful woman.  I look at her pictures and she was a glamour queen.  And she was the homecoming queen.  And my father, who was ten years older, he was at Southern University, drafted in World War II.  And as a result of being drafted in World War II, he went off to fight.  (Background noise).  And what was interesting about Dad was -- I'm going to back up just a little bit.  My father's side, his parents had six children.  But as I was growing up and would go back and visit, (background noise), I thought my father was the product of 14 children.  But what Daddy Mike, that's my grandfather, would do if there was ever a child that was homeless, if there was ever a child that was abused, Daddy Mike would go and take that child in and raise that child as his own.  Again on my father's side, it was a very interesting situation.  They all went to college and so a lot of aunts and relatives went on to black colleges or negro colleges or colored colleges at that time I guess that's how they described it, and they were all teachers.  Daddy Mike sent my father, Daddy Mike wanted my father to go to Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia], my father just did not want to go Morehouse, he wanted to go to Southern [University, Louisiana].  And my father was at Southern.  And at Southern he was drafted into the war, and he was placed in one of the few combat units for African Americans.  And he was sent off to--about six of them were drafted out of Southern, and he was sent off to North Africa and he fought.  And I just recently learned that my father was awarded two combat medals in World War II.  And all six of them came back.  And my father didn't talk about the war very much, but what I did learn from my relatives when he did talk about it, his unit was used as the decoy to see how many com--of the enemy.  And so they would be put out there to be kind of the sacrificial lamb, and if they survived, then they can come back and report how many of the enemies were attacking.  So I guess my father saw a lot of people who he started out with, die.  And Daddy always talked about how proud he was that the six of them who were drafted out of Southern and out of their area, all came back alive.
Speaker 1: That's quite a story.
Speaker 2: Yeah and so Daddy for some reason, either learned about San Francisco or heard about, or came through during the war which it's kind of interesting because typically if you came through the west, you were going off to the Pacific.  But somehow or another he got a glimpse of San Francisco and he saw the fog, and he said if he should survive World War II, he was going to back and marry the homecoming queen, whomever was the homecoming queen of their high school, Jackson High [School].  And, and move to California.  And my mom was the homecoming queen.  He went back, saw my mother, he already, always knew about her, but he said you know she was kind of young, but she was the homecoming queen and he married her.  And my mom, unbeknownst to her, my father had this master plan to come to San Francisco.
Story_ID: 1291
Speaker 1: Now was there, there a, I guess a story about how they, they met?  I mean--
Speaker 2: The story how did they meet.  My mother [Beatrice Jackson] always knew of the Jackson family.  And because my grandfather was a legend for, in that small town, of one, owning--he was the only one who owned a car.  Two, he got to some, I don't know prominence or whatever, in the, in the black community, which they called it the Quarters in Jonesboro-Hodge.  And more importantly, he was known among blacks and whites in the town as the man who would take in children and raise them to be his own and educate them, and feed them.  So he, my grandfather had a lot of respect and my mother had a lot of respect for the Jackson family.  And my mother, because of her mother always stressing education, my mom was attracted to my father's [Alson Jackson] family because so many of them were teachers and principals and so forth, of many of the schools in the area.  So they knew each other.  My father always thought, used to say when he--about my mom, she was always a cute thing, but she was so young.  But somehow, he said somehow or another it didn't make a difference when I came back after the war.  Cause she was ready to be married.  (laughs).
Speaker 1: Okay, so ten year difference then.
Speaker 2: About, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, so how long was it before he moved--he just moved right off to San Francisco [California]?
Speaker 2: Right after the--my mother said I do and my mom said it was on her honeymoon that she learned we're moving to San Francisco, and that was it.  Mom followed.
Story_ID: 1292
Speaker 1: So did he have relatives out here already?
Speaker 2: No, it was just kind of the thing, it was the black migration from the South.  Let me back up a little bit too.  My dad [Alson Jackson] came back with his brothers and a lot of them from World War II.  My father talked about growing up in the south and his relatives said he had to leave.  Cause they didn't think my father was going to live.  My father was a very outspoken man.  And the, the segregation--I mean this is, if you can think of something worse than Jim Crow.  That--we were talking about Louisiana and during the time of my father's and my mom's upbringing.  And Daddy often told me the story when he, when he went off to college, he didn't think that white people could be just.  Because what he had experienced being a young African American man in the south.  And he went to Southern [University, Louisiana] and one of the first classes, it was a literature class, and he read this book by this as he said, a great author, William Shakespeare.  And the first story he read out of William Shakespeare was the 'Merchant of Venice'.  And then he realized that not all white people were wrong or bad.  He realized that there was always a struggle for good and evil and that his experience in Louisiana should not reflect on everybody.  And another thing that Daddy learned from that book of the 'Merchant of Venice', is that there was a woman lawyer named Portia.  And he said if he should ever have a daughter, she was going to be named Portia and she was going to be a lawyer.  Now you look at my name, it's Teri.  My older sister is named Portia.  And my father always had plans.  Survive World War II, take his education and to become a teacher, marry the homecoming queen, have a daughter, name her Portia, she would become a lawyer and she would fight for justice.  Well he survived World War II, he did get his degree from Southern.  But his Southern [University] education because it was from a black college, did not translate for him to be a teacher in California.  And the only way he could be a teacher and to realize his dream to teach geography, was to go back and do another four years and my father said no.  He was a very proud man.  His degree in his mind was just as good as anybody else's.  So he did not fulfill that part of the dream, but he did marry the homecoming queen, he did have a daughter named Portia, and Portia hated law.  And my name Teri, is named after my sister's imaginary friend.  She was four years old, she could spell Teri with to Rs, and I became the lawyer.  And it, it was very interesting because my father did everything to make, to encourage my sister Portia to be a lawyer.  My mother was on this master plan.  Once my father said I want to do this, my mom [Beatrice Jackson] was the implementer, implementer.  So what my mom would do was have Portia sit down and watch all the Perry Mason shows, the "Young Defenders", anything that had anything to do with law, they wanted--they put that poor little child in front of the TV set and made her watch TV that dealt with lawyers.  She would--they would not allow her to watch "Dennis the Menace" because they said she was so bad, that she didn't--they didn't want her to get ideas.  So it didn't work.  I was born, not that I was an afterthought, but the whole focus was Portia to become a lawyer.  And then the movie came out 'To Kill a Mockingbird'.  My father and mother had this plan that okay, we're going to take Portia off to go see this movie 'To Kill a Mockingbird' and she'll realize her destiny.  They couldn't find a babysitter for me cause I was about four or five years old when the movie came out.  But they assumed that I would go to the movie, fall asleep and Portia would realize her destiny.  Portia fell asleep, I watched the movie, I walked out of the theater and my mom said that I looked up at my dad and mom and said I want to be Atticus Fench.  I want to be a lawyer, and I want to fight for justice.  And the rest was history.  And my--
Speaker 1: How old were you
Speaker 2: About four or five years old.
Speaker 1: Four or five.
Speaker 2: And I wanted--I saw an injustice.  A man wrongly accused, a man wrongly convicted and ultimately died for something he didn't do.  And I wanted to be a part of a system where I could make a difference.  And what struck me most was--there were two scenes that struck me most about "To Kill a Mockingbird".  Was when Atticus Fench walked out of the courtroom and everyone stood up who--in the balcony.  And I remember those balconies when I would go down and visit my relatives in Louisiana when we would go to the movie theaters and we would have to go to the balcony.  I remember that vividly.  But when the minister turned to Scout and said stand because a great man is walking by, because he made an impact on these people.  Another thing that was always in his, in my mind ever since I saw that movie was when the judge read the verdict, or the verdict was read and the judge stormed off the bench and slammed the door.  I remember saying to my mom, why couldn't that judge--he is the judge, why couldn't he do something?  Why did he just walk off the bench?  He knew it was wrong.  I was able to pick that up.  And that has always been my guiding force of why I wanted to be a lawyer, and I guess ultimately to be a judge.
Story_ID: 1293
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Well we're going to go, go back to what it would seem like simple territory at this point and ask you if you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: Yeah I have my early memories of the post off--my father [Alson Jackson] worked for the post off--post office for forty-eight years.  And I remember the post office picnics.  I remember that's where, in San Francisco [California] the majority of African Americans worked during that time.  I remember the family and every, every triumph was our--you know the whole group.  And I remember the discipline that I had from people who I didn't even know, but they just were a part of raising me.  I also remember when my family moved into our neighborhood, in the house where it's currently.  We integrated that neighborhood, and integrated that school.  I remember that vividly.  And I remember coming home one evening from visiting relatives and seeing green paint all over our house, saying niggers go home.  And I remember that and I was about, again, five or six when that happened.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What were--can you describe the neighborhood you grew up in and if you moved in, to tell us about that too.  But, but were some of the sights and sounds and smells of your environment?
Speaker 2: My neighborhood?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Well the first neighborhood I can remember at four was a very diverse neighborhood in Daly City [California].  And I remember my parents saying the state took our house away, which now I have learned the freeway came through and they bought out eminent domain.  And then when we moved into the neighborhood that we integrated, it was Italian Catholic.  And what were the sights and sounds?  Many of my friends or my neighborhood--childhood friends I should say, their parents worked in, on the wharf in San Francisco.  So I remember a lot of fish.  I remember a lot of Italian cooking.  I remember a lot of Italian in my neighborhood.  And here was this black family that moved in.  And children for the most part, were children.  But it was not easy.  It was definitely not easy.  What I also remember, my mother [Beatrice Jackson] was the only one who worked, so we had--I had my father working and my mother working.  Whereas just about everyone in the neighborhood, their mother stayed at home.
Speaker 1: Now what did your mother do for a living?
Speaker 2: She worked in the Probation Department until she retired three years ago in San Mateo County, California and worked her way all the way up the ranks.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Was she a Probation Officer?
Speaker 2: No, she wasn't a Probation, she was a Head Dietician.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And she just basically was the go-to person.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now what did--were you finished with the sights and sounds--
Speaker 2: The sights and sounds and, yeah.
Speaker 1: All right, okay.
Speaker 2: I can still remember the spices and how they cooked.  I also remember the Fridays where they couldn't eat meat, but we could cause we were Baptist (laughs).  And all the kids would sneak over to my house to have a hamburger or something (laughs).
Story_ID: 1294
Speaker 1: Now was, was church a big part of growing up?
Speaker 2: Church was a big part, but more importantly, religion was a big part.  My father [Alson Jackson] and mother [Beatrice Jackson] had this philosophy.  My father was a Methodist, my mom was a Baptist.  My father became a Baptist, but what was important--my father said I don't care what religion you become a member of, so long as you know that there's something more powerful than you.  So I was just encouraged to be in a religion.  But yep, church was very prominent in my life.
Speaker 1: Did you have like a, a, roles in the Baptist church?
Speaker 2: Well that's interesting you should ask.  Did I have a role in the Baptist church?  I tried to sing in the choir, but apparently the minister heard how bad I sang and said, "Sister Jackson, we have some other work for you."  So I did Usher Board, I did youth groups and I stayed with the Baptist church probably up until college.
Speaker 1: Now which one was it?
Speaker 2: Hmm?
Speaker 1: What Baptist church was it?
Speaker 2: Paradise Missionary Baptist Church in San Francisco [California].  And through law school, my parents are still members, or my mom.  My father's now deceased.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so is Paradise still in San Francisco?
Speaker 2: Yes it is.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay, now so church was, was very important.  Would you say that you got most of your moral instruction from church or from the family, or a combination of--
Speaker 2: My family.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My family.  Those dinners.  You know my father would sit to my left, I would sit to my mother's left.  So my--the children were separated, my sister and I were separated cause I guess we would always fight.  So we, my mom would come home from work, Dad worked my entire life the graveyard shift for the Post Office.  Which the reason is is that my parents never wanted my sister or me, for us to come home to a dark house or to a empty house.  And you have to understand too it was before protection.  Because we moved and we got a lot of death threats.  So my father wanted to be there during the day.  My mother would have my sister and me sleep at night with, with her in the bed so that if something should happen, she didn't have to run around the house to gather her kids up, and she can exit the house.  So yes, it came from the house, the household.  The moral upbringing, the--our culture, our heritage.  You know my father used to have this thing where we couldn't--certain times he would have my sister and me sing the Negro National Anthem.  And we could not sit down to dinner until we could go through all of the verse.
Speaker 1: All of the verses or just one verse?
Speaker 2: The whole song.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Cause the song is a history lesson.
Speaker 2: Yes it is, and Daddy thought it was very important.  And every time I hear it even--I remember going to a jazz club and they were playing it.  You stand, you acknowledge it, and that's--I just did it, automatically.  So yeah I got it from my parents.  And the, and the reinforcement came from the church.  But you know I liked how my parents kept us real with the religion.  Because their thing was you got to remember these are people, they make mistakes, and that this is everyone's interpretation.  So you have to find it for yourself.  You got to feel it for yourself.  You can't have someone preach it to you.  And remember my, my father used to always say remember it's a man preaching.  That's his interpretation.  So I really appreciated that about my father and my mother.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay so they let, let room for you to figure some things out for yourself?
Speaker 2: Yeah, and encouraged me.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I went through my--I wanted to be a Catholic phase.  I went through my period I wanted to be a Buddhist.  I went through, and they just encouraged it.  My mom was probably a little bit more apprehensive, my father just said let it happen.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, now how old were you when your, your parents moved to the Italian neighborhood?
Speaker 2: Again, around the same time as to--no, it was before "To Kill a Mockingbird".  So I guess four, four or five.
Speaker 1: It's about 1964?
Speaker 2: 'To Kill a Mockingbird' was in '63 [1963] wasn't it?
Speaker 1: Sixty three, [1963], okay.
Speaker 2: Sixty four [1964].  It was in the--you know what?  It was 1962.  So it had to have been 1959.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay 1959.
Speaker 2: I was about three, but I can remember it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was so hostile.  You know how you wait for your next door neighbors to come by and say hello?  I remember the homeowner's association asking and saying to my parents, what if we buy you out?
Story_ID: 1295
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's a welcome.  Well okay, now did you go to kindergarten?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, some schools don't have it.
Speaker 2: I went to kindergarten.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I remember my dad taking me there.  Cause mom had already gone to work.  And all the little kids were there crying.  And Dad looked down at me and said don't you cry, don't let them see you cry.
Speaker 1: What, what was the name of your school?
Speaker 2: Colma, Colma Elementary School.
Speaker 1: C-O-M-A?
Speaker 2: C-O-L-M-A.
Speaker 1: C-O-L, okay, okay.  Now did you like school?
Speaker 2: I loved school.  I loved the education, yeah.  It was--I loved studying.
Speaker 1: Did you have a favorite subject?  I mean--now you, now at this point you have in your mind even as a little kid that you're going to be a lawyer.
Speaker 2: Right.  What was my favorite subject?  I--history.  What was my worse subject?  Math, to this day (laughs).  If you listen or if you look back on my report cards, my favorite subject was talking (laughs).  But definitely history and spelling and--but I was, I guess kids nowadays in college they call them fuzzies and techies.  I was not a techie.  I was definitely a fuzzy.  I loved English, I loved writing, I loved history, anything that caused me to be analytical and not to say that math isn't, but I just loved that, that area.
Speaker 1: Okay.  We're going to pause here again for a little change here.
Story_ID: 1296
Speaker 1: Now we, we were just referring to something as we were--I was asking you about school but, but you just said something that kind of triggered another question.  Your father [Alson Jackson], did he, did his interest in coaching a lawyer to fruition shift from your sister to you at a certain point, or --
Speaker 2: Absolutely.  When they--when I walked out of the movie, cause they had to wake up my sister and I said some, and I was talking about the movie, they just said okay, Teri's going to be the lawyer.  So at that point, and Portia was like good.  And I--the rest was history.  So then they did everything to encourage me to be a lawyer.  So many times you know I remember growing up and going to see Willie Mays and Willie McCovey and baseball.  My father was a fanatic when it came to sports.  But my dad because of my interests, started taking me to see every court case in San Francisco [California] if there was an African American involved.  Be it a judge, we had two of them that come to mind was Judge [John] Reynolds and Judge [Anthony] Kennedy.  And then Mayor [Willie] Brown when he was a lawyer, and George Walker and--they were few and far between in terms of African American lawyers and judges in the Bay area [California].  And any time there was a case that involved someone who was African American, and they only had one car.
Speaker 1: From a, from a standpoint, is there a lawyer or a judge.
Speaker 2: Judge, and there were only two, there were two African American males and they were in the Muni (ph.) court.  Daddy would go, we would go by way of bus or taxi or whatever, or a friend would come by and pick us up.  And he would take me to the court and it was like going to a game for me.  And we would sit there all day and watch this judge in action.  And one thing my father and mother reminded me that I said, and I don't remember it.  But they said that one day when I was watching someone in court and I kept asking, well what about women?  What about black women?  Why aren't we there?
Speaker 1: What, what did he say?
Speaker 2: They just said baby, they're just--my father said baby maybe you'll be that black judge, or that black female judge, or that black female lawyer.
Speaker 1: Did he talk about the play?  About 'Merchant of Venice' and Portia?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, that's how I, yeah.  That's how I knew about it and how Portia learned her name, (laughs) yeah.  But Portia, to this day, my sister has no attention or has no interest at all in law.  Believe it or not, she's in the education field, and that's what she wanted to do.
Story_ID: 1297
Speaker 1: Okay, now did you make good grades in school?
Speaker 2: Yes I did.  You know I have to put caveat.  I made good grades, but it was very difficult for me because of the racism.  Somehow or another my writing or my reports were not as good as the white child.  I became a very self conscious about what I could do because I had so many teachers basically if they didn't come out and say I was dumb, they would by grading me, tell me I didn't know what I was talking about.  And in fact I remember there, they wanted my parents to put me in a special class for students who were not doing as well.  And my father [Alson Jackson] and mother [Beatrice Jackson] just would not accept it, and they used to say--I remember the teachers' meetings.  That they said that my parents do not accept my limitation.  And my parents would take all of my work and my father would look at it and especially and his friends who were in the field, and they said there was nothing wrong with Teri's work.  It was their way of trying to hold me back.  It was--and it made me very self conscious.  And I lacked confidence.  And it was because of my parents I would always say I can't do it because Miss So-and-so said I couldn't do it.  It was my parents that said you can do it, you don't let that woman say you can't do it.  And the reason I'm saying woman, cause most of my teachers at that time were women.  And I won't say all of the teachers were that way, but it did come in and it did take--racism did have an effect on me.  You know when they talk about--and forgive me if I'm just going on.  But Brown v. Board of Education and Dr. [Kenneth] Clark's study where he had the, the black doll and the white doll and that children picked the white doll as good.  And they were saying that's why separate but equal is not fair.  That even when you're in a class, if you're treated differently, you start to feel there's something wrong with you.  And I saw that from time to time.  But I had very strong parents who knew that that was going to happen.  And my father, you know and I say this many times to students cause I teach now, that every time I heard the word no, I probably heard I couldn't do it, I probably heard the word no more times than you're great, you're intelligent and you're a role model.  But every time I heard the word no, that made me just more determined to do it.  And so that's--I do remember that much about my school.  Did I have good, good grades?  Yes.  Did they reflect what my--I did?  Not a lot of times because of the racism.  They didn't want me there.  And we always had to fight that.
Speaker 1: Okay now, now were there any other black students in school?
Speaker 2: My sister, who was in fourth grade, or was always four years ahead of me, I should say.  And you know what was interesting?  When I was a little girl, I remember being on a play, playground with kids were my own age, to be a Portia was a very--it was like cooties.  It was a very negative thing.  They were talking about my sister.  So eventually by the time I went to junior high, they integrated, they were busing students in.  But for the most part, no.
Story_ID: 1298
Speaker 1: How did you work it out socially in terms of having friends and that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: Children are children.  And there were times that you could tell what they talked about at the dinner table.  And I remember the, the Shultz (ph.), they were two doors down.  And Darlene was my age and typical kids, we got into a fight.  And we were fighting over toys.  And interestingly, my house--we had the toys and there were only two kids, whereas most of the kids around us, there were seven or eight kids.  And so I
Speaker 1: These are Italian Catholics.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and so I guess they looked at my--and Portia and I had more toys.  Well it, it's just because there were so many they had to share.  And so Darlene wanted to take my baby doll and I pulled and said no, you can't have it.  And Darlene's response was "you nigger".  Now this is a little girl--we've gone to swimming classes and whatever else.  And with that, now my father [Alson Jackson] and mother [Beatrice Jackson] always taught me I am not and to this day I cannot, I cannot, I despise people calling people racial names.  I just cannot tolerate it.  But my father's attitude was if anyone should ever call you a nigger, you are to give them the biggest ass, excuse my language, the biggest ass whooping imaginable.  Cause every time they hear that word, they will always remember how they got everything beaten out of them.  And that was how I was taught.  So that was my red flag to just go ballistic on someone.  So I beat the whatever out of Darlene.  Of course she went home badly bruised and bleeding and so forth.  And Mrs. Shultz just went hysterical, came down and my father came down and all the neighborhood came out.  Mrs. Shultz is showing my father look, I mean I, I pretty much beat--I, I don't know why the girl wasn't unconscious.  But Mrs. Shultz was saying look what your daughter has just done.  And my father's looking down at me and said Teri, why did you do this?  And I said because Darlene called me a nigger.  And Mrs. Shultz was just flabbergasted.  And Darlene, Mrs. Shultz looked down at Darlene and said did you do that?  And Darlene said yes.  And my father said first I want to apologize for Darlene being beaten because really Darlene is too young to know that word.  She must have heard it at the dinner table with you and Mr. Shultz.  So my father said if anything, Teri should have beaten you.
Speaker 1: That was, that was, that was the statement, that's it.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And so I think the word got out, do not call Portia and Teri the N word.  Now we had our fights, but a lot of times I can remember growing--going to a little girl's house and her father, her father did not want me in the house.  So what they--he would do was make me wait in the basement.  You now, typical San Francisco Daly City [California] house.  You had the garage on the bottom and the house on top.  So I remember hearing all the kids upstairs playing and I'm sitting downstairs in the garage waiting for Linda to come down.  And Mrs., and Mrs. Gomez comes down, she's doing laundry and she sees me in the basement.  She goes what are you doing here?  And I said well Mr. Gomez told me I couldn't come upstairs.  She went upstairs to look to make sure Linda's father was not there, and then brought me up.  So I remember those situations.  And the reason my father worked at night is because he did not want my sister and me to walk home cause he was frightened the kids would jump us, particularly teenagers.  So he wanted to pick us up from school, drive us home and he just wanted to make sure that we were within earshot if there was any, any problem.  Now I don't want you to think my whole life was negative, because interestingly one of my dearest friends from second grade is still one of my best friends to this day and we work out together, we travel together and so forth.  But it was not as easy.
Speaker 1: What's her name?
Speaker 2: Her name is Linda Isaac.  And Linda, I remember when she came in in our second grade and she kept saying I'm Persian, I'm Persian.  I kept saying where's Persia?  And my father being the person who loved geography, got the map out, pointed it to me and I remember going over to Mr. and Mrs. Isaac's house and showing them on the globe, I know where you live.  And they're Syrian.  And so it was--we, I think we had that bond because we were not quite like them.  And we are still good friends to this day.
Story_ID: 1299
Speaker 1: Okay, all right now did you go to middle school?
Speaker 2: I went to middle school.  But I don't want you to think it was all Italian Catholic.  We had the Germans, we had Ital--we had Japanese and Asian, but they were few and far between.  But yeah, I went to middle School.
Speaker 1: Yeah Shultz sounds like a German name.
Speaker 2: Yeah the Shultz were German.  You know I'm going to fast forward on you and I--forgive me for doing this, but there is a Deputy Bailiff, you know as judges we have bailiffs in our courtroom.  And now his name is Pray, the Pray family.  So they also lived in the neighborhood.  And what I remember about the Pray, German as well, and but there were about ten of them, a lot of them, mostly boys.  One of the Pray boys was responsible for doing the vandalism on our home.  Putting the green paint on our house saying "niggers go home."  So when I was assigned to this one particular courtroom, here I am Judge Jackson, first African American judge in San Francisco and I used to be head of Homicide.  And I know I'm skipping forward and we can go back.  I saw the Pray and I thought what an interesting name.  And I, and I kept thinking in the back of my mind, I knew some Prays.  They were in my neighborhood.  And I didn't think much of it.  And I knew he was always guarded around me.  Now this is a man, if there's any problem in that courtroom, the first person he has to protect is the judge, and that's me.  So he is my line of defense in a criminal courtroom where I'm doing felony arraignments and preliminary hearings on very serious cases from homicides and a lot of them gang murder cases.  And this is my line of defense if something should happen.  And so the months would go on and you know every once in a while I guess he would see that look on my face like I knew some Prays but I, you know, those Prays I--you know, and I probably thought in the back of my mind I don't ever care to see any of them as long as I live.  So I'm sitting in my chambers one day and Deputy Pray comes into my chambers and he says you know I know you've been looking at me and trying to figure out my name for the longest time.  And I said well you know, I remember some Prays when I grew up as a kid and they were a lot of you.  And he said--there were a lot of Prays.  He says yeah, I was, I grew up in your neighborhood, that was my family.  I knew you and your sister, and that was my brother who vandalized your house.  And it was just full circle.
Story_ID: 1300
Speaker 1: Well okay so what was the name of your middle school?
Speaker 2: Colma.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Middle School.
Speaker 1: C-O-L-M-A.
Speaker 2: It was Colma Junior High at that time.  We didn't even have a middle school.
Speaker 1: Okay now by that time were there more blacks students?
Speaker 2: In junior high?  Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And there were just more people of color period.  Latino, Filipino and Asian.  When I say more, I can name the names.  Sammy Baxter (laughs) and Virginia (unclear), Cheryl Yano, Linda Isaac and myself (laughs).  Which was more than when I started.
Speaker 1: Okay so now were you involved in any school activities, you know, growing up?  I mean what kind of activities?
Speaker 2: Cheerleader.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Student body, you know cheerleader, homecoming princess, student body representative.
Speaker 1: You became the homecoming princess?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: For, was it grade school?  I mean or, or--
Speaker 2: Upper high school.
Speaker 1: Upper high school.
Speaker 2: Yeah, but junior high?  In junior high, oh, Scholarship Club, president of my, my class for the seventh grade.  I received honors, so therefore you can work in the, you know the principal's office cause then you would be his little assistant and so forth.  And I just excelled.  Everyone knew Teri Jackson, always had her homework done.  Teri Jackson is the go-to person and that was just how I was--I had that reputation.
Speaker 1: Okay so the teachers gradually began to accept, see you as someone who was achieving, rather than someone who--
Speaker 2: They, I think they always saw me as someone who was achieving.  But they just knew that their conduct, especially in elementary school, was not going to stop me.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So okay--
Speaker 2: And I gained a lot of respect.  And by that time you have to understand we were going into the late '60's [1960's] and the '70's [1970's].  We were getting teachers who were coming in from Berkeley [University of California Berkeley, Berkeley, California] and Stanford [Stanford University, Palo Alto, California] and they were so cool and hippie and they were all this and they were involved in a lot.  So the traditional teachers' makeup was changing as well in junior high.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right so you--junior high around, around the time of the summer of love aren't you?
Speaker 2: Oh my God, oh yeah.  And say it loud, I'm black, I'm proud, and yes.  Berkeley and the campuses were on fire and you know, demonstrations were taking place at San Francisco State [San Francisco State University].  Danny Glover who I, my -- I grew up with.  My parents and his parents were very good friends.  He was involved in the whole black power movement that was going on at San Francisco State.  I remember --
Speaker 1: He was President of the Black Students.
Speaker 2: Exactly. Hayakawa [Dr. S.I. Hayakawa] was the president [President of San Francisco State University] at the time.  Angela Davis was going, was happening.  We had the Moraine County shootouts when I was going into junior high.  Things were happening, Black Panthers, Huey, Huey Newton was taking place.  So things were changing (laughs).
Speaker 1: So this is not only just a--these weren't just local events, but they were national news.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: (Unclear) national news.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.  So change, you know we had teachers who were coming in from Berkeley and Stanford and San Francisco State who were teaching in our junior high schools at that time.  the traditional teachers were retiring or they were moving on.  And it was just a whole different awareness.
Story_ID: 1301
Speaker 1: How, how did your, your parents feel about some of the justice issues that were raised by the Black Panthers first?  You know, the right to bear arms, the right to, you know where blacks fit in terms of American society and the law.
Speaker 2: They did not like the violence.  They did not believe in guns, you know, but they liked the idea of how they were, they were doing the free food programs.  And feeding kids before they would go to school.  Many things that were similar to Head Start.  So that much.  My father, mother understood because of the injustices that were going on with how African Americans were being treated in the, in their communities, that their crimes were not getting reported.  That they were being harassed.  They understood that, but they did not believe in the violence aspect of it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And we talked about it.  We constantly talked about it.  And you have to understand too, my parents were involved in the Civil Rights Movement.  I remember when Dr. King [Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.], and this is going back, when he came to San Francisco and spoke at Grace Cathedral and the Cow Palace.  My parents, they got us in, we were there in Grace Cathedral.  And I have a funny story.  Here he was speaking and--no first they do this promenade where he's coming in and it was very solemn and very beautiful.  But I was a little kid, I didn't quite understand it and I had a little pocketbook, a little patent leather pocketbook.  And he was just--he comes up to begin to speak and there was just this hush in all of Grace Cathedral.  And you have to appreciate Grace Cathedral.  It's one of the biggest cathedrals in San Francisco [California], and the oldest.  And so right before he was ready to say his first word, I just said oh this is too serious, I guess as a little girl.  So I take my purse, my little pocketbook, and I close it.  You know that click?  And it just echoed throughout the entire church.  My mother [Beatrice Jackson] was holding my hand.  I thought she was going to break my hand.  And I remember Dr. King looking down, because everyone flinched.  Cause what in the world was it?  And my, you know I look back on it and maybe I don't know if they had Secret Service, or if they had protection, but you know they could have all come down on, on me.  And Dr. King gave my parents a look like, yeah I have a little one like that too.  So I remember that.  So my, my parents were always involved in the Civil Rights Movement.  They supported the sit-ins.  They supported the, the walk.  Now did they go back and, and--no they had kids here in San Francisco.  But they were always giving money.  And many--I remember my parents did not go on a vacation, and that would be the drive back to Louisiana, because they didn't have the money because they were giving it to the [Civil Rights] Movement.  So how did they feel about--
Speaker 1: So who did they donate to specifically?  I mean do you remember?
Speaker 2: I don't know, no.  I know, I don't know.  But I, I think I would have to imagine it would be Dr. King.  Because they were very much supporting probably, what is it, the Southern Christian--
Speaker 1: Leadership Conference.
Speaker 2: Leadership Conference.  I'm sure that they were contributing there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I remember how my father and mother would talk about we're not going to Disneyland because this is something more important.
Story_ID: 1302
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now Dr. King was murdered.
Speaker 2: '68 [1968].
Speaker 1: In 1968, April 4th, '68 [1968].  Now you were about 12?
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: Okay, do you remember where you were when you found out about it?
Speaker 2: I was in school.  I was doing a project with the teacher, if I'm not mistaken.  My sister was in high school cause she, she walked out of class and came home.  And my father [Alson Jackson] asked her why.  And my father came and picked me up, in fact.  And he went to look for Portia and Portia had left school and she and other African American students walked out of class.  And my father was annoyed with her because he was frightened, he didn't know what happened.  But she said I had to.  I remember talking to--I was talking to my junior high school teacher, Mr. Chandler, when that happened.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That--I knew it shook your family up.
Speaker 2: It shook everyone.
Speaker 1: Did it change you, your--
Speaker 2: More determined and more committed.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: More committed to, for me to be a lawyer.
Speaker 1: What other--and those days--
Speaker 2: I think I became a little bit more radical than my parents, though.  I started to look more toward Angela Davis, if you want to call it radical.  But during that time, you know not longer after it was Moraine County shootout, that was in the '70's [1970's], Rochelle McGee.  And my parents kept saying no, you don't resort to what the enemy has done.  Cause I remember saying well what if they had guns?  And my father said, he was hit by a sniper.  So having guns would not have protected him.
Story_ID: 1303
Speaker 1: Okay.  So when you were I guess getting ready to go into high school, who were your heroes as you and--I mean did you have any popular culture heroes in those days?
Speaker 2: Angela Davis (laughs), Angela, right off the mark, Angela Davis.  I loved the academics, I loved, I saw her debate.  I don't know if it was on a PBS program or something.  I just said, boy I want to be like that.  But I wanted to always have the law with me.
Speaker 1: Did you have a big afro like her?
Speaker 2: Oh I had a big afro, oh yeah, oh yeah it was there.  Until I was a cheerleader, then the fro got in the way, but yeah, but yes.  Absolutely, I wanted to--in terms of lawyers, oh my gosh.  I used to look at Clinton, Clinton White he passed away.  He was on the Court of Appeals.  He represented the Zebra killing, murderers.  People accused of doing the Zebra killings in San Francisco.  Which put San Francisco kind of in a shut down.  I admire him and I wanted to be like him.
Speaker 1: Now this is a, a serial killer.
Speaker 2: Yes, right.  So Justice White and it's a kind of a combination.  At that time on TV, Melba Davis was this news woman.  I wanted to be like her, how poised she was and articulate.  So the role models were there, few and far between.  And they were--and you know, I know this sounds silly, but I remember the funeral of Dr. [Martin Luther] King.  And I remember when Mrs. King was holding her daughter and that look that she had of hurt, but also pride.  I wanted to always have that look.  But cultural icons, you're getting--I was getting more into the radical.  I read everything from H. Rap Brown to 'Soul on Ice' to the 'Autobiography of Malcolm X', that was my awakening, high school everything was happening.  And I wanted to read more, I wanted to hear more.  I want to hear more views and my parents said go for it.
Speaker 1: It's funny you mention "Soul on Ice" and I, I can't think of a more anti-feminine than "Soul on Ice".
Speaker 2: I know.
Speaker 1: What, what did you think of that in those days?  Did you, did you feel that way when you read it?
Speaker 2: I was disappointed because you know, before reading--and my mother [Beatrice Jackson], interesting.  She was going to college at the time so she was reading it.  So you would hear about it.  Read it in the magazines, 'Ebony' Magazine talked about it.  And so when I read it, I thought this is not what I thought about the revolution.  And that's why my father [Alson Jackson] and mother said you've got to read everything.  And so, and again what my parents did when I read the book, they reminded me of religion.  That you got to remember people and that you, there's certain things that you can take from it, some certain things you can disagree with it.  But it's okay for the education.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And not to put these people up on pillars.
Speaker 1: So Eldridge Cleaver can be treated like anybody else.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: Pull out what you want.
Speaker 2: Whatever, and there were some things that I could pull out, and other things I did not care for.
Story_ID: 1304
Speaker 1: Okay.  So high school, now you were a cheerleader in high school.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.  Here a radical cheerleader, I did everything from being president of the Black Student Union in our high school, to being also the cheerleader (laughs).  That's just kind of me.
Speaker 1: Those roles don't often mesh in the, in the--
Speaker 2: Especially during that time.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: But it's called bridging, and it's, maybe it's because of my upbringing, you know.  Growing up and seeing the good, the bad, the ugly of everyone.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Think maybe sometimes it's only in the black community where it--being an achiever in a conventional sense and being a radical are seen as the same.
Speaker 2: But you know when I look back, I don't think we were radical.  I think it's just acknowledging my culture.  Being very proud of my culture.  Trying to bring in speakers to my high school who were talking about--we brought in a lot of speakers from Berkeley [University of California Berkeley].  We arranged for black students from my high school at that time, there were a lot more of us, to go onto college trips and so forth.  I don't, I didn't look at it as radical.  If you look at it, it was pretty mainstream.  Because we all wanted to do something for the community.  Cheerleading, I loved sports.  I wanted dates (laughs).
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So now, so you continued to be an honor student in high school, I take it?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.  And, and again going to school every summer.  I, you know when you talk about education, I loved education.  So I would go, I looked forward to summer because then I could take classes I wanted to take, and I could take more electives.  Because at that time I know they call it AP [Advanced Placement] now, but they were called College Prep courses.  So I did that during the year and then I would take the electives during the summer.  As a result of it, I should tell you that my parents started me in kindergarten at four, at age four.  And that was because my father [Alson Jackson] said and my mom [Beatrice Jackson], that I was reading everything.  They thought well you're big enough, cause I'm a tall woman, big woman.  They said well they enrolled me in school so I was already young for my class in the first place.  Rolled around at fifteen, sixteen I had all of the credits to get, to graduate from high school.  So here I am fifteen, turning sixteen and I'm ready to graduate.  And I told my parents I was bored.  And my parents didn't want to lose me at that time.  Cause they thought if they had me stay for another year, year and a half or I guess two years into high school, that I would get bored and they would lose me forever.  So I left high school at fifteen, sixteen, went off to college.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So now I take it that in high school you must have found some mentors or--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, who, who were some of the people who helped?
Speaker 2: Mr. McClanahan was my mentor.  He was a black counselor there and he would always be the one to fight on my behalf.  I didn't know that until I learned many years later.  You know teachers, just like judges, we sit, they sit around the lunchroom and they talk about the students.  And the teachers didn't know what to do with me.  They just again maybe they had their stereotypes.  And they just didn't know what to make of me.  He was always my biggest advocate.
Speaker 1: Okay.  In, in high school did you get a chance to do anything special in the summer, like travel or anything like that?
Speaker 2: In high school, oh I always traveled with my parents.  If it was a six week--my father and mother said we're going to do a trip around the United States and learn, and see the greatest sights.  I would--
Speaker 1: Who all did that?
Speaker 2: My parents, oh yeah.  When I was in high school and when I was in fourth grade.  We did a big trip around the country.  And it was wonderful.  I saw relatives, but it was not to see relatives.  It was to see America.  When I was in high school, I did this thing encouraged by Mr. McClanahan, called the Institute of Nations.  And where we would spend four weeks in the La Honda [California] hills and, and kids were from not all over the country, but from all over the world.  And we would talk and share ideas and we would have speakers come in.  And that's when I wanted to go and live in a kibbutz and to work in a kibbutz.
Speaker 1: So that, that concept was introduced to you--
Speaker 2: In high school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And in fact I had the choice of going that year to go work in a kibbutz or go off to college early.  And it turned out I went to college cause my parents just didn't want me to go that far, and that's when they had the big, the big war in 1973.  And I would have been there trapped in that hole.
Speaker 1: That was '67 [1967], yeah.
Speaker 2: There was a '73 [1973].
Speaker 1: A '73 [1973] too?
Speaker 2: The Yom Kippur.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That was in seven, that was in '73 [1973].
Speaker 1: Okay.  We're going to pause here again for a second.
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Story_ID: 1305
Speaker 1: Sorry, so okay so you've had a lot of broad experiences and rich experiences as a high school student.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: And so you're, you're following, you still had in your mind you wanted to be a lawyer, right?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.  You know I never changed on being a lawyer, but then it was changing back and forth, what kind of lawyer did I want to be?  Did I want to be a criminal defense lawyer, did I want to be a civil rights attorney, but it was always going to be a lawyer.  I saw the law as the thing that could make the changes, to make a difference.
Speaker 1: Now did you get a chance to meet some of the black legal people here in town, the lawyers and judge and--
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My dad would always, did right away.  And most of the time--my father [Alson Jackson] was a golfer.  I have to tell you.  And my dad learned to play golf as a child being a caddy in the South.  So he would take, he was a scratch golfer which, you know, I don't play golf, but apparently, that's pretty good.  And he would play with Willie Mays and [Willie] McCovey, and he got to take a lot of the African American judges out and teach them how to play golf because, you know, they're bench.  They wanna be able to socialize with their colleagues.  And they would come to my dad for the golfing lessons.  So I got to meet them through my father.
Speaker 1: Okay, well, so, all right so now, here you are, and you're a senior in high school--
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: You were the queen--
Speaker 2: No, junior prom princess, yes.
Speaker 1: Junior prom, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, cause I didn't stay my senior year, so that's--usually the queen's taken out of that.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, now--
Speaker 2: But you also asked about, you know, my father was a Grand Juror in San Mateo County [California].  And so I got a chance to meet a lot of the legal community, not just African American but judges and so forth because he was on the criminal and civil grand jury.  My mother [Beatrice Jackson] was a planning commissioner for San--for the City of Daly City [California], and I got a chance to meet a lot of the government people through her as well.  And that's all through elementary and high school.
Speaker 1: Okay, so how did you choose what school to attend?
Speaker 2: All right, parents veto (laughter).  I was, I wanted to go to U C Berkeley [University of California, Berkeley].  I was accepted to U C Berkeley.  Now, think about a fifteen, sixteen year old kid in 1973 going to U-C Berkeley.  I think that my parents still would be looking for me on that campus to this day.  So I was also accepted to U C Santa Cruz [University of California, Santa Cruz].  And at that time, it was the newest of the U C [University of California] schools, and it was the smallest at the time.  I think they only had a total population of maybe 4,000, four to 5,000 students.  And my parents, my father always dreamt of one of his daughters going to a U C California school.  You know, think about University of California was the premier as a school, I mean next to Stanford [Stanford University, Palo Alto, California], of course.  And I didn't wanna go to Stanford, but I wanted to go to University of California.  So our compromise was Santa Cruz because otherwise--
Speaker 1: Okay, but it's still considered University of California.
Speaker 2: Exactly.  Because my father said you either go to UC Santa Cruz, or you stay another year in high school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so I was the first black--I should have been the first black valedictorian of Jefferson High [School].  But unfortunately, racism raised its ugly little head again, you know you think everything's going fine.  You hit a roadblock and they just did not want me to be the valedictorian.  And this teacher who I had admired, English teacher, was the person who dug up an old law that you had to be 17 to graduate from high school or something like that.  And so they--and it was all to keep me in from my--the class I should have come out with, the class of '74 [1974].  Well to be truthful, it should have been '75 [1975] because my parents put me in so early.  But the class I had started with was '74 [1974], but I was coming out in the class of '73 [1973], and there I would be the valedictorian which McClanahan told me if I graduate in '73 [1973], you're going to be the valedictorian.  If you come in '74 [1974], you might, you'll be the salutatorian because there was a kid with a higher GPA.  But that was not the reason.  And they, they--my parents had to get an attorney to threaten the school district that they were going to sue in order for me to graduate in 1973.  And so I was supposed to be first in the class and somehow or another, my straight, my straight A's were not good as Louie Bejack's (ph.) straight A's.  So I became the salutatorian for the class.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Does that makes sense?  (laughs).
Speaker 1: Yeah well, it only makes sense in the context, you know of things that don't make sense.
Speaker 2: Exactly.  But you know it was so funny.  Things were going pretty well, here I am, and that's when I realize Mr. McClanahan all the things that were going on in the teacher's lunch room and the things that were being said, and this its embedded or this subconscious racism that was still very prevalent then.
Story_ID: 1306
Speaker 1: Okay.  So here you are at UC Santa Cruz [University of California, Santa Cruz], eighty miles south of San Francisco, roughly.  How did you like it?
Speaker 2: Loved it.  It was just what the doctor ordered for a--as young as I was and this intimate environment, it was great.
Speaker 1: Okay the small--
Speaker 2: Small school.  I wouldn't have made it in Berkeley.  Academically maybe, but maturity, probably not.
Speaker 1: So did you come home frequently?
Speaker 2: Not my freshman year.  My parents came down a lot, but no.  I stayed pretty much on campus.  And I enjoyed it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now your major was--
Speaker 2: Politics and economics.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So any--this is 1973.
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: What significant things are going on in the country in those days?
Speaker 2: Okay significant that was going on.  We were getting--Watergate was happening.  We were coming out of Viet Nam.  And David Frost's interview with Nixon [U.S. President Richard Nixon, 1969-1974].  Angela Davis was speaking and let me see.  Huey Newton had come back from Cuba, Eldridge Cleaver had come back from Cuba, and that was--President Ford.  Yeah those were the things that were going on.
Speaker 1: Okay well the Water--did you watch the Watergate hearings?
Speaker 2: Every hearing.  Every one, Barbara Jordan, oh my gosh.  She was so eloquent on the Judiciary Committee.  What was it, Rubino, how he was on the Congressional Judiciary Committee, Sam Irving over in the Senate hearing, watching Dean testify, oh yes.  Watch, I think I watched a lot (laughs).
Speaker 1: Right, it was on 24/7 at one point.
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: Again it wasn't a lot of choices in '73 [1973] to watch on TV.  If something like that was on--
Speaker 2: Well Charlie's Angels was on (laughs).
Speaker 1: You know what?  Something like that would be the whole entire day time schedule would be taken up with the hearings.
Speaker 2: Right.  And every time I would come in from class, I'm watching this.
Speaker 1: This is, we're still like five years from cable basically.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: About five years from cable.  So--
Speaker 2: But I remember when David Frost was interviewing Nixon.  What was it, my junior year?  Everybody was--every lounge, anyone who had a television, we all watched that, those interviews.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Were you involved in any of the activities at--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, so what kind of things were you doing?
Speaker 2: Again, the Black Student Association.  At that time, that's what we called the BSA.  I was always an officer.  Usually Santa Cruz [University of California, Santa Cruz] is kind of similar to the Oxford mold where you have colleges within the college.  So I have the student of student of Stevenson College.  So I was always on their Governing Committee.  I started a tutorial program for the high schools where college students would go down and tutor in some of the impoverished areas in the city of Santa Cruz, as well as around Santa Cruz.  And I'm very proud of that program.  For four years I did that.  I tried to, but I was not, I was in the finals before China was open.  You know where they would bring students over.  I tried to apply and do that.  I also did this program called the Institute of--Washington Institute--Learning Center Institute where I studied and worked on the Hill with Congresswoman Cardiss Collins.
Speaker 1: From Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 2: From Chicago.  And I was there for--when President Carter [U.S. President Jimmy Carter, 1977-1981], his inauguration, I was there for that.  So yeah I think I kept a little busy.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  You were there through the inauguration of Jimmy Carter.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So did you have any favorite instructors on the campus?
Speaker 2: The Provost Herman Blake, African American of Oaks College.  The Social Science Professor Carlos Norenyo (ph.) of Stevenson College.  Carolyn Clark who was a biology professor, but she was African American, so I had to sit in her class, was an idol, and then my counselor Josie King, my unofficial counselor Josie King.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Were there any students there that, that we know about now, or, or really were significant to you?
Speaker 2: My first friend and still friend to this day, Calvin Filer, who is a Superior Court Judge in Los Angeles, out of Compton.  His father in fact was just honored, he just passed away and he was just honored.  Mr. Maxie Filer.  Unfortunately, well it depends on how you want to look at it.  Calvin's father was, has a history for taking the bar for the State of California forty-something times.  And the reason why, it's not a negative, it's because he was so committed to raising his family, being the mayor of Compton.  And he, Maxie Filer carried the California flag during the March on Washington.  Calvin and I have parallel tracks.  He went to Berkeley, I went to Georgetown Law School.  He came out, he became a state public defender, I became a prosecutor.  He was appointed to the bench three days before I was appointed to the bench.  So literally, they used to call us the twins when we were at UC Santa Cruz.  But he stands out and he's always very near and dear to me.
Story_ID: 1307
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now how did you decide what law school to go to?
Speaker 2: Good question.  I was of course wanting to go to Hastings, and the reason being is that Willy Brown, Mayor Brown graduated from Hastings [University of California, Hastings College of the Law].  Joe Cotchett who is a legendary litigator in the nation, he was a graduate of Hastings.  But I also wanted, I thought at the time I wanted to have a master's in foreign service and international law.  So here I was going into law, but I was thinking more on an international level.  And Georgetown [Georgetown University, Washington, D.C.] and Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] had two of the premier schools in international, where you can get a joint degree and master's in foreign service and a JD Degree.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay so that's why Georgetown.
Speaker 2: That's why Georgetown.
Speaker 1: Did they give you a scholarship, or were you able to--
Speaker 2: No, my parents, they put me through.  And you know that was--when they, we could afford school.  And I'm thinking here my father worked at the Post Office, my mom worked in the Probation Department and they were able to put me through three years of law school.  It was just, you know that's when it was affordable.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So Georgetown, now this is--Georgetown Law School, this is 1970--
Speaker 2: Seventy Seven [1977].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I also have to add the Dean of Admissions, Dave Wilma.  He came out to Santa Cruz [University of California, Santa Cruz] and I was very impressed with him, and he sold me on Georgetown.  I also applied to Howard and I was thinking about going to Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] as well.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Because my thing was if I'm going to go to D.C., I would love to be at Howard Law School.
Speaker 1: This would be the, it would be the first time you were at an all black school situation.
Speaker 2: And that's what was attracting me.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  But at the time you attend Georgetown, D.C. is known as Chocolate City anyway.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: So how did you like D.C. in those days?
Speaker 2: Loved it.  You know I remember my best friend to this day, the first woman I've ever met, Monica Jordan, she was a Washingtonian.  She was born and raised in Washington, D.C.  Went to George Washington University, went to Georgetown.  And it was my first month that I was there at Georgetown and I became ill.  I didn't have a doctor.  I was--and Monica said well here's the name of my doctor.  She gave me the name, I didn't think anything of it.  I go into his office, he's a black man.  And I--I was just so speechless that I couldn't even talk.  And he was like, he said what is wrong with you?  I said you're a doctor.  And he said and you'll be a black lawyer.  And I'm like yes (laughs).  And that's what I loved about D.C. was all of these African American professionals.  And yes I would see them few and far between, but they're so spread out in the Bay area [California].  Even unfortunately to this day we're spread out.  But you saw a concentration of African Americans and beautiful homes, middle class homes and, and it was okay.  You didn't have to be in a white neighborhood to be in an affluent neighborhood, and I loved that.  You know, and my parents and my family know, know to this day if I hadn't come back to the Bay area, cause this is where I was born and raised, I would have stayed in D.C.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now, now what did you decide to--you, you decided to focus on international law, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay so was that the right choice for you?
Speaker 2: Was it the right choice?  No.  Ultimately it wasn't.  I had learned from my mom [Beatrice Jackson], my dad [Alson Jackson] was disappointed.  He wanted me to go to law school, but he was disappointed that I was going in that direction.  He looked at it as--it could be worthwhile cause I kept telling him I could be in the State Department, I could make changes globally.  Apparently dad wanted me to come back and do something in the community.  So, but he was supporting me.  And what--it would have been a four year program.  So one of the requirements would be for me to go and--at least what I did was between my first and second year in law school, I went and studied at Oxford [Oxford University, United Kingdom].  And I had a great time.  And I remember my father sending me a letter and said you know I see signs of a professional student here.  And he said look Teri, if it's three years for a JD, that's fine.  If it's four years for the JD and for the master's in foreign service, that's it.  But he says after that, you're on your own.  And I went there, I enjoyed it, the international environment and I thought--
Speaker 1: This is Oxford, England.
Speaker 2: Oxford, England at Queen's College.  It was great and I was able--I was studying conflicts of law.  I was able to sit in various inns and to see barristers and solicitors and solicitors and I realized oh, if I'd did this, barristers would be the, would be ideal and I was thinking maybe I should come over here and I came back and I took this very innocuous little trial advocacy class.  And this civil lawyer who probably had never--now that I've been in the profession, probably in his entire career may have done maybe one or two jury trials.  And I remember I got up to do a cross-examination, I sat down and of course you know, I'm a student.  I know it was pretty pathetic.  And I remember in front of the class he said you'll never be a trial lawyer.  You were that bad.  Well you know what my motto is.  Every time you tell me I can't do it, then I'm going to do it.  I then enrolled in an advocacy clinic, became, you know, got honors in the clinic and the Master's in Foreign Service went out the window and I realized I wanted to be a trial lawyer immediately, and which my father was happy.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, that's more like the justice model that he foresaw way back when.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, so now was there any special students---what teachers at Georgetown do you remember?
Speaker 2: Absolutely.  Professor Pat King, first African American professor, female professor and it's not just female, male.  I think she's the first person of color, tenured at Georgetown.  She is still teaching at Georgetown.  Gene Flegal my civil procedures professor, and--
Speaker 1: How do you spell that?
Speaker 2: Flegal, F-L-E-G-A-L.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And those are my two favorite professors.
Speaker 1: Okay, any, any--your fellow students there--
Speaker 2: That stand out?
Speaker 1: Yeah or --
Speaker 2: Other than my best friend Monica?
Speaker 1: Yeah, just I don't know.  Sometimes we go--
Speaker 2: I have some, well a lot are--a lot of my colleagues are not on the bench and many of them are managing partners for firms throughout the country.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: I know two for sure.
Story_ID: 1308
Speaker 1: Okay so when you graduated, you moved immediately back to Oakland?
Speaker 2: Oakland?  I've never been in Oakland.
Speaker 1: I mean--
Speaker 2: San Francisco.
Speaker 1: San Francisco.
Speaker 2: Yeah, immediately, immediately back here and I started, I was in a civil firm.  And once I got my bar results, the firm said we're going to lose you and I said yes.  Again, because I wanted the challenge of litigation and there was a big void in being a prosecutor, people of color who were prosecutors, and I wanted to do that.
Speaker 1: Okay did that like kind of turn your father's [Alson Jackson] idea on his head in a way
Speaker 2: Are you kidding?  It was what he envisioned.  He wanted African Americans to be in the position to make a difference, and that's--being a prosecutor, that was the proudest moment of his life for me.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Or for him.
Speaker 1: I would have thought he would seen you as a defense lawyer rather than a prosecutor.
Speaker 2: No, well I guess the reason is is that Dad--let me back up a little.  You know my father at the post office [U.S. Post Office], when there was anyone who was ever wrong, particularly if you were of color, they would always come to my father and he would be the advocate, I guess the defender.  My father saw far too many crimes that were committed against African Americans and no one cared.  And my father wanted someone to be in that position to make a difference.  That when you had a crime committed against someone of color, that there was someone there to understand what that person, what it would take for that person to come into the courtroom, and understand that they could make a difference in terms of yes, we're going to prosecute this crime.  So if anything, I was living up to his dream, and there was a big void during that time of prosecuting domestic violence cases.  They did not see those as crimes.  And my father saw and was very proud that I saw, that I wanted to get involved in that.  So you know Daddy had said to one of his friends, because they were kinda shocked that I was a prosecutor, he said Teri's going to be like "Hawaii Five-O".  She's in the position to say "Book 'em Danno."  And that's what we need.  We need black people to be able to say this person should be prosecuted, not because of their race, because they committed a crime.
Speaker 1: That was a common conversation in the barbershop when I grew up, men would say that if you shot another black man, you'd be out next week.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: But if you shot a white man, you're going to be put under the jail.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --they would say.
Speaker 2: And that's what Daddy wanted to, he wanted them to change.  He wanted you, our system, if you shot a black person and you're guilty, you should go under the jail.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Well tell us how, how it was in the early days as a, as a district attorney.
Speaker 2: As a woman and as an African American, very difficult.  I started in San Mateo County [California], again the first African American woman.  Very aggressive, did not want to be assigned roles.  And my first case that I had, I remember I was talking to the police officer over the phone during the interview, and talking to him, telling him I'm Teri Jackson, I'm the Deputy DA who's going to be handling your case.  And you know, just kind of going over the facts and then arranging the time for him to come meet me in my office to go over the case for trial.  And my office was called "The Dungeon."  So that meant you had to come down the hallway, go down two or three, turn right, turn left, and then come into my little office.  Very much away from the secretarial pool and my other colleagues.  So if someone mugged me in there, it would be very hard pressed for someone to even hear me scream for help.  So the officer comes in and they direct him to my office.  And the doors open and the first thing out of the man's mouth was, "Jesus Christ, you're black."  And he said it so loud that the secretaries stopped and heard this man's statement to me.  And I looked down, I said "You're right, but I'm your prosecutor."  So it was very challenging because you know, their, their attitude was will she be tough enough and will she, because the defendant may be a African American, might be--will she be more lenient?  So there were all those questions, and even Keith Sorenson, who was the DA who hired me, said they're going to--every judgment you make in that courtroom, every decision to prosecute or not to prosecute, they're going to question you more than they will question any of my other Deputy DA's.  He said are you ready for it?  And I said absolutely.  And the rest was history.  And I have had those situations where they would question me and it was difficult, and it was almost as though every day, can she still speak English?  That kind of thing.  And yes, they scrutinized my case, my behavior, my, my work more than they would my white counterparts, and I knew that was going to happen.
Story_ID: 1309
Speaker 1: Can you give us an instance of that I guess?
Speaker 2: Sure, I can give you a very specific instance.  I can give you several.  But one that brings to mind are--and I often talk about it with younger attorneys and younger judges when they--I'm sorry to digress.  We do something, I'm a seminar leader for new judges.  And we do this thing--tell us the most humiliating experience you've ever had.  And I often use this one as an example.  I was handling a case for a city in San Mateo, and they had done a big drug bust.  And it received such notoriety that you know it was all in the paper and so forth.  And unfortunately when the case was assigned to me and I started looking into it and I found what the officers had done was wrong.  You know how they got to the dope was illegal.  I mean I often say sometimes you know the best thing we got the stuff off the street, but you know, you violated this person's Fourth Amendment rights and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  And I knew that this was going to have some political fallout.  So I had to go--I went, I didn't have to, I went and spoke to Keith Sorenson as well as my immediate supervisor and we conferenced, and there was just no way in the world we could justify the conduct of the officers and/nor should we.  But I wanted the DA to be prepared that there may be some political fallout.  And I guess he too realized that it was going to be a fallout on this.  So he followed me, he came into court the day that I dismissed the case and I guess it was his way of showing solidarity and that I'm backing my DA's decision on this.  And we didn't think anything of it.  And it happened to be a three day weekend.  And at that time, I was out of the dungeon, I was in this office that the afternoon sun, quite lovely office, but the afternoon sun would just bake down in the office.  So we leave and back in those days we weren't worried about hypodermic needles, we weren't worried about anything and it was not uncommon that I might sent off, we used to call goldenrods to an investigator or to a police officer and say bring the evidence and let me see it for some reason.  Maybe the defense attorney was going to come by and look at it.  We weren't real concerned about chain of evidence at that time.  So when I came in after a three day weekend and it was a kind of Memorial weekend.  The sun had baked in my office, the office was extremely hot and it was a weird smell, but I didn't think much of it, thinking you know mildew, government office.  And there was an evidence envelope in the middle of my desk.  Didn't think anything of it.  The phone rang and I'm talking on the phone with my right hand, I'm opening, manipulating the evidence envelope and I'm putting my hand in and I felt something very sticky and stiff fur, and I can still feel it to this day.  It was a dead rat, a bloody dead rat.  On it there was a note, when I flipped the envelope over, that this is what we do to rats.  Now of course it was a big problem.  I was thinking immediately I'm a lawyer, I'm going to sue.  And it was traced back to some officers.  They tried to explain it, the same agency that I might add, I had thrown out that big case.  They said it was just a joke.  And there was a big brouhaha, and I remember Horace Wheatley, Judge Horace Wheatley, Justice White, and I think Ben Travis, all African American judges and justices, when all this--Horace was--Clinton White was not on the First District, I think he was just a judge at the time.  And we all met, they heard about it, we talked about it and they said Teri, you know, this--not that what did you expect, but this is, racism is alive and well.  We have your back on this.  If you want to sue, we have you.  You have the African American Community behind you.  But think about your life or your career in the long term, because you will always be noted for this rat incident versus what they did to you.  So apparently the two officers were reprimanded, they were suspended and so forth.  But that one is vivid in my mind.
Speaker 1: So you didn't sue them.
Speaker 2: I did not sue them, but they, we did go through the administrative process.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: And another incident that comes to mind is when I was talking in chambers and the defense counsel was making their argument, and the judge made a ruling and the ruling was wrong and I said I want to be heard on the record.  And the judge says we'll do it in chambers, which is Rule No. 1 you don't do it in chambers.  And I--it's in the record.  And so I insisted the Court Reporter come in to record.  If you want to do it in chambers, fine.  But the judge didn't want to have other people hear.  So the defense counsel made their argument and I started to cite the case, explain to the judge why the ruling was wrong.  The judge became very embarrassed by that.  And as I'm going on to give him the page and to say you want to look at such-and-such and started to quote the case, that's when the judge just said "Shut up."  And the defense attorney, I was so--he grabbed my arm and just said "Let's go, let's go."  And I guess he saw that I was ready to, all right earrings are coming off, let's go.  We're going (laughs).  And so the defense attorney probably saved my career by taking me out of the room.  (Laughs).  But yeah, those are two things I can remember.  And along with many others.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Let me--now you were in the Prosecutor's Office how long?
Speaker 2: I was in San Francisco--San Mateo from '80 [1980] to '84 [1984] or '81 [1981], '84 [1984], then I joined San Francisco [California] in '84 [1984] I was recruited by Arlo Smith because he knew of my interest in domestic violence.  There weren't any laws in place, and domestic violence was just starting to take off.  And I wanted to pursue that area by prosecuting cases that were domestic violence related.
Speaker 1: Okay.  We have to pause here again.
Story_ID: 1310
Speaker 1: Okay now San Francisco, District Attorney's Office, 1984, okay.  Okay now you were recruited?
Speaker 2: I was recruited by Arlo Smith.  He wanted, he knew my interest in domestic violence cases, and the laws were just start--there were--I shouldn't even say laws.  There was an awareness that these cases should be treated like crimes, like every other crime, and that this is not something that happens between two loving, consenting adults.  It is something that needed to be dealt with and it was a big, passionate interest of mine.
Speaker 1: Let me ask you this:  And I don't know how this plays out in the Bay area [California], but in Chicago [Illinois] there's a, a women's organization called Southwest Women Working Together.  It was formed around the issue of domestic violence.  It was formed by the wives of Chicago Police Officers.
Speaker 2: Interesting.
Speaker 1: Yes, who themselves were--
Speaker 2: Victims of domestic violence.
Speaker 1: Yes.  That was (unclear) actually stuck, you know, and stayed in existence.  It still exists.
Speaker 2: Well the organization here in San Francisco and that's the Family Violence Prevention Fund, many of those women were either victims of domestic--when I say victims, but their partner or spouse was battering them, or they grew up in domestic violence environments.  And so that's what started here in San Francisco and became nationally recognized.  And there were a group of us.  One now is the DA [District Attorney] over in Alameda County, [California] Nancy O'Malley.  There was a woman by the name of Pierce who's a DA, and she still is down here in Santa Clara [California].  And several people in southern California.  We were kind of the California advocates as prosecutors in the area of domestic violence and domestic violence prevention.  And I'm very proud of many of the laws that are here in California, I was involved in them.  Testifying, writing them, implementing them, teaching.  When the Violence Against Women Act took place, I was called upon to lecture around the country in how to effect prosecution and how to set up a Domestic Violence Unit in various DAs offices.  And I do a lot of training with the police departments all over the country.
Speaker 1: Okay.  How did things change?
Speaker 2: Oh, God.
Speaker 1: --the training and the laws.
Speaker 2: When I first--this is how even though my court that I sit on, and a judge who was well respected, who's now since passed.  When domestic violence cases, when we were taking an active, you know, had a unit and we were pursuing these cases, I'll never--and it would take a great deal to convince a person of domestic violence to come and testify.  To testify against this person who you've entrusted your life with, who you've shared a bed with, meals and so forth and sacrificed for.  And now you're testimony may, I won't say responsible, but it will have a factor in whether or not this person goes to prison or not.  And so it took a lot.  Very fragile souls.  And I'll never forget I just got this woman convinced to come in, in fact I, I used to go and pick them up and bring them to court.  And she was crying.  And I had to get--and she was just composed and I said don't worry.  We're in there, the court, judges, we're going to all be there to protect you.  Just tell the truth.  So here she is, she's a little behind me.  And I'll never forget the judge yells out, courtroom full of people, "Oh here comes Teri Jackson and her debutant."  That was the attitude when we first started prosecuting domestic violence cases.  Judges hated it.  And I'll never forget another judge said if two adult people want to beat their brains out at their home, why do we need our criminal justice system involved?  So when you're telling me that the domestic violence awareness and the organization started in Chicago by women who were officers of domestic violence, I am not surprised.  Because people felt that when an officer arrives on the scene, just take that battering partner out of the house, walk him around the block, and bring him back home.  Walking that person around the block only meant you're sobering him up, so therefore he can hit her more, you know.  So I'm very happy that we made it a recognized crime.  It's always been a crime, but a recognized crime.  And we've even gone one step further.  California was one of the first to acknowledge domestic violence partners, same sex partners.  That this is just as prevalent in same sex relationships as in heterosexual relationships.  And I'm very proud that we were able to get a voice for those who are in those battering or troubling situations.
Speaker 1: So it really changed the attitude, I mean police can no longer say that someone being battered or beaten to a pulp in their house is okay as long as somebody, they're married to or going with is doing this to them?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  To get that--and not only the police get, society get the courts.  I mean I remember my first jury trial.  There is no question.  You know, here are the photographs, just getting jurors convinced that this is a crime, and get them to talk about it.  And you know now, more and more people are forthcoming and said I grew up in a household of domestic violence, or I have heard of it.  People didn't talk about that in '84 [1984].  You know I had a case where the young lady said the reason I didn't report it because I saw my mother being beaten, I saw my grandmother being beaten.  I just thought it was a way of life.  I've also when I was a prosecutor, saw the consequences of children growing up in households of domestic violence.  Had a very unfortunate case where this young kid saw his mother being beaten, not by one, but by several men in her life.  But the last one, this one, this child trusted this man cause he had been in his life the longest.  And he turned around and beat, had beaten his mother and he was only 11 years old.  He felt helpless.  The man was convicted and this child would go and visit him in, in prison.  And it only--what happened was this child then turned eighteen and he was only visiting him, this batterer, the one, last one who had battered his mother in prison just to keep tabs on him.  And on the first day that the man was released, this child had him come to a certain location in San Francisco and had ambushed him and killed him.  And that is the impact.  This child felt, and I remember in his interview, watching his tape, he said I was helpless, I couldn't help my mother and now I could.  But it was the wrong way.
Speaker 1: Yeah this is a serious matter, domestic violence.  So, so what are the--what do you think is the most significant legislation or action that you took part in?
Story_ID: 1311
Speaker 1: Oh, the significance?  The legislation and changing the attitudes of our courts, and training our officers.  I was the first to try the first elder abuse in the country, in the state of California, if not the country where a man was convicted of beating his mother to death.  Most of the time people think elder abuse, nursing homes and so forth.  But I was the first to--we didn't even have jury instructions.  We're trying this case and we're making, I won't say we're making up the jury instructions, but we're writing them as we're trying the case.
Speaker 2: What year was this?
Speaker 1: Oh that's People vs. Foley and it was in maybe 1990, '89 [1989], '90 [1990].
Speaker 2: People vs. Foley.  Can you talk about it now?
Speaker 1: Oh yeah.
Speaker 2: I have to ask, I don't know.
Speaker 1: No, no, no, don't worry.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right.  Can you tell us something about--what, what happened?
Speaker 1: It was a man who was taking care of his mother, a fairly well established man.  And, and what happens a lot of times with the caregivers, you become overly protective or more of a control situation.  And the mother was dying of cancer as well as she was an Alzheimer patient.  And Foley did not like--he would, he would stress out and go over the top.  The Department of Elder Services would come in, recommend that he would put her in a convalescent hospital, and then she would be there for one or two days and then he would take her out.  And on the day that he took her out, the mother had defecated in the bed and he had just lost it.  He had beaten her so severely that the Medical Examiner testified that her injuries were that of an airplane victim in a crash.  And we had to bring in experts to testify that the injuries that she sustained were not of, as they would sane senile ecchymosis or basically would be where elderly people would bruise very easily, and it was not--she did not die as a result of her medical conditions.  So it was the first one and to our surprise both the defense attorney who is now the Public Defender of San Francisco, Jeff Adachi, we were writing the jury instructions as we were trying the case because it was the first to ever be tried in the country.
Speaker 2: Wow.  So that's the first in the country.  That's okay.  Okay, okay now what was the date for the Domestic Violence Act?
Speaker 1: When I was involved in that?  I, I stayed involved in domestic violence and training up until the day I left the DA's [District Attorney] office in 1996/'97 [1997].
Speaker 2: Okay, okay.
Speaker 1: The current law dealing with, it's called Penal Code Section 422, we used to call it terrorist's threats, but it's basically intimidating or not intimidating, but threatening a witness or making threats to a person.  That was designed for the domestic violence situations where as a husband or a partner is being led away, he would yell out to the victim when I get out I'm going to, you know, blah, blah, blah or kill you or something like that.  So now that is a crime.  That went and got tested all the way through our courts and a lot of states now have that type of crime.  I was also involved in whether or not experts can come in and testify.  I testified on that legislation.  Expert to testify about the Battered Woman's Syndrome.  It shouldn't be the Battered Woman's Syndrome, it should be the battered partner syndrome.
Speaker 2: Okay, now, now I don't know if you were involved in this case or not.  But the--I don't see it, it's to on our outline.  But when was Harvey Milk shot by Dan White?
Speaker 1: I was in law school, my third year in law school.
Speaker 2: Okay so you weren't even back yet, okay.
Speaker 1: No.  I remember Jonestown [Peoples Temple Agricultural Project, Jonestown, Guyana] and I remember that all happened in the same year.  And I was being interviewed and I--San Francisco--you have to remember I grew up here.  I can remember when the Trans American Building was being built.  I can remember when they broke ground for our BART [Bay Area Rapid Transit] Station.  And that was the first time I've ever seen San Francisco [California] be the walking dead.  You know cause it was the Jonestown massacre that happened that same year.  And Moscone and Supervisor Milk were killed that year.  And I had relatives that I lost in the Jonestown massacre.
Speaker 2: Wasn't Dan White in the District Attorney's office, or--was it, was he--
Speaker 1: Dan White was a police officer.
Speaker 2: Police officer, okay.
Speaker 1: And he was a supervisor, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right.
Speaker 1: No, it was Tommy Norman who prosecuted the case.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay, all right.  So--
Speaker 1: That was a little bit before my time.  But I saw the fallout from it.
Story_ID: 1312
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now what about one, one of the sons of San Francisco [California] is OJ Simpson and his case I guess it unfolded in '95 [1995] I believe.
Speaker 2: That was down in Los Angeles [California].  You know when he was in that infamous Bronco.  You should have seen all the DA's [District Attorney] like go back to L.A. [Los Angeles] because any county you would go in, we could try him.  We were like turn that Bronco, make a u-turn and get back into Los Angeles.
Speaker 1: Nobody wanted to have an expensive case like that.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay, so what were your thoughts about that? Here's a domestic violence--
Speaker 2: Well you know some loss came out of that as a result of prior, prior domestic violence cases can't come in for--to show propensity for domestic violence, which is I think Evidence Code Section in California, 1109.  So that, you know as a result of that case, some things came out of it.  I used that case and that trial in--I was invited to come and train prosecutors over in Hawaii by the National District Attorney's Association.  We all went over there and we used that case as a training tool.  It was interesting, to say the least.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did, well you don't have to answer this, but did you think he was guilty?
Speaker 2: Could they prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt?  No they didn't.  You know probably he did do it.  I don't--I wasn't there, I don't have all the evidence.  But did they prove it beyond a reasonable doubt?  No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: There is a difference.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well-
Speaker 2: And the reason I can't, you know and I often tell--because I'm not in that courtroom every day.  So I cannot make an evaluation if someone is or is not guilty.  Because having tried enough high--presided over enough trials that have received some notoriety in the press, unless you're in that courtroom and hear all the evidence, you can't sit and make that judgment call.  Now I--what I've seen of the evidence, I don't think they proved it.  I think that the prosecutor, and in fact I'm on record for that when I was lecturing that, they got distracted on a lot of issues that they shouldn't have been.  They should have stayed focus on this case.  And Johnny Cochran did an excellent job making the courtroom and trial his.
Speaker 1: And California, you know really had a lot of high profile cases in those days.  I was thinking about Rodney King too earlier, Rodney King trial.  That was in '92 [1992] and '91/'92 [1991/1992].
Speaker 2: Rodney King was right before OJ.  So yeah about that, '91/'92 [1991/1992], mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  And the, the idea I guess-Mark Fuhrman and the OJ trial seemed to--now this is the impression.  You know I was living in Chicago at the time, but I think the impression was a lot of black folks was that Mark Fuhrman really lost the case for the--Los Angeles.
Speaker 2: You know again, I'm not there.  But when you embrace your witness before he gets on the stand, I, I--you know I always believe you have to be objective and be professional.  And that part, when I saw that I was a little taken back by Marsha Clark's doing that.  But I'm not in the courtroom and I can't stand in her shoes.  And I don't know what her strategy was.  So there were a lot of things that could have, that led to that, the verdict that we, we saw ultimately.  But did he do it?  We'll never know.  Did they prove the case?  I--obviously they couldn't, they didn't prove it beyond a reasonable doubt.  That much I can say on record.
Story_ID: 1313
Speaker 1: Okay, and what were some of the cases that you were involved in that are the most significant that you can talk about?  This is--you don't have to--
Speaker 2: As a judge or as a attorney?
Speaker 1: In the District Attorney's Office before you became a judge.
Speaker 2: I, gosh, other than--I shouldn't say other than the Foley case, that was a very significant case.  I've tried my share of homicide cases.  You know, domestic violence, gang, homicide cases.  One of them is People vs. Dwight Smith, was a domestic violence case that received a lot of attention from the media.
Speaker 1: What year was that?
Speaker 2: Oh goodness, in 1990, '91 [1991].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I, I you know, God, I'm going blank on a lot of my trials.  I was the first African American woman to be head of homicide for the San Francisco DA's [District Attorney] Office.  And that was when Arlo [Smith] was defeated, Terence Hallinan then became the DA.  And he appointed me as the head of homicide.  And then I left because I had offers from some firms and I wanted to get that civil experience.  And I thought I was going to end my career as a civil attorney.
Story_ID: 1314
Speaker 1: Did--California has the death penalty, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Now do you, do you believe it's effective in--
Speaker 2: Do I believe it's effective?  Unfortunately I'm not allowed as a judge to talk about if it's effective or not effective.  So that--I have handled cases where I was going to seek the death penalty on.  But those are few and far between, and that was as a prosecutor.  But for me to say now, unfortunately I'm not allowed to talk about that as a judge.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Well tell us about your ascension to a judge of the Superior Court.  How, how did that happen and was, was it a surprise, or--
Speaker 2: It was a surprise.  You know I think every prosecutor at some time or another thinks that they're going to be a judge, that's the next step.  I'm a person who loved the law and loved the profession of being in the law.  But I have to say by '95 [1995] I was starting to feel that I was one dimensional as an attorney and I wanted to go into the civil arena.  So I had the opportunity of going with one of the most prestigious firms in the, in the nation, Orrick, Herrington and Sutcliffe, they invited me.  They were pursuing me and I really appreciated that.  And I was pursuing them as well, so it was an equal thing.  And I thought I was going to retire.  Now if you were to talk to some of my classmates and my best friend Monica, they knew from my first year in law school that I was going to be a judge.  I really did forget about the judgeship.  Didn't even think about it.  And I was asked in 2002 in February by the Governor's Office, to submit my name.  And in fact I remember going to Ralph Baxter, the managing partner for Orrick and saying you know, I've got this, I've received this invitation to submit my name for a judgeship.  I only have three weeks to do this application.  And we all, we both laughed and said no worries, you know by the time this judge--the Governor would get around to appointing--because we all assumed he was going to go into a second term.  Which he did but then he was recalled.  It will be several years down the road.  So I submitted it because I was being asked.  And I didn't think anything was going to happen.  So I put it in February 15th, 2002 and August 12th I was appointed to the bench.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you were--
Speaker 2: It was fast.  Did I expect it?  No.
Story_ID: 1315
Speaker 1: Well how, how has it been?  I mean you know Gray Davis was the Governor.
Speaker 2: How, how has it been?  It's the best job that I can ever ask for, next to teaching, I love teaching and I do that at law schools.  I'm a neutral.  I love sitting there and watching how jurors come to their decisions.  I, as I tell people I do not have a dog in this race or a pony in this race, or whatever you want to use.  I just want to make sure both sides get a fair trial.  I am from that old school.  I run a courtroom that everybody treats everyone with respect and dignity.  I don't--I stood next to, I've been involved in some of the most heinous murder cases and stood next to some of the most--people accused of the heinous crimes as a prosecutor.  But you still treat them with dignity and respect.  Everybody in my courtroom is addressed by their last names.  Everyone will be given an opportunity to be heard, and I'll make my decision based on the law.  And it's just great.
Speaker 1: Now who, now who was convicted that would be considered a heinous, you know--
Speaker 2: A person, I separate the person from the crime, and I tell jurors to do that.  This person is a human being and they are afforded the dignity of a human being.  The crime can be the most heinous thing in the world.  I've had hate crimes where people have killed, you know multiple people.  I've had people, I've seen maybe as a prosecutor or even as a judge, where people have done rape and murder and, and various other things and children are involved.  But you still separate the crime from the person.  And you're not here to judge the person, you're here to judge the crime.  And that's what I try to impress upon the jurors.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: And that's what I mean by that.
Story_ID: 1316
Speaker 1: All right, all right.  Let's see, well with what would have been some of the, I guess the memorable cases that have come before you as a Superior Court Judge?  Can you talk about those?
Speaker 2: Well a lot of mine, cause they were murder cases, they are on appeal.  One case that is not on appeal is a homicide case that I can talk about.  Is--it's kind of unfortunate.  These two childhood friends and they grew up and went different paths during the dot com time.  And the victim was making a lot of money setting up cubicles for all the dot com businesses and so forth, great deal of money.  And he and his girlfriend got a little trendy little place, re-gentrified area and they were giving a lot of parties and probably had some drugs there and so forth.  And so I guess he went back to his old childhood friend to get the drugs.  And I guess the childhood friend saw a lot of cash being thrown around.  And here the defendant and another assailant break into the house and rape and sodomize the girlfriend in front of the victim, she's a victim as well.  Throws her into the closet naked and then she opens the closet door and saw the defendant put the gun to the guy--to his childhood friend's head and shoot him, and blow off his head.  Then turned, opened the closet and shoots her in her stomach, where she's running and she survived.  She runs out, and I hope I'm not getting to graphic, where she could see her intestines and everything hanging out.  And what was so sad about--well everything was sad about the case.  But sitting there in the courtroom watching family members from both sides, the victim and the defendant, and these people were next door neighbors.  And they remember their sons being in Cub Scout together.  That's very painful, that's very painful.
Speaker 1: Now how do you--
Speaker 2: And I watched it every day.  Cause I have the bulls eye seat so to speak where I can see everything.
Story_ID: 1317
Speaker 1: How do you keep from being depressed I guess in a criminal court setting day after day?  I, I just--I know people watch these things on television, but they, they can always be comforted by the fact that they're fiction for the most part, or based on a true story.  But here you're hearing true stories and the crimes are real whether you, whether the person on trial is the perpetrator or not.  You know, how do you keep from--
Speaker 2: Well if you'll allow me to go back a little bit.  You have to remember I was head of homicide.  I did homicides.  I, you know and they don't kill between nine and five and many times under Arlo's [Smith] administration as well as Hallinan's administration, they wanted the homicide DA [District Attorney] to be out there.  So there was not a--there was times when I was out there at the scene and I would see it all.  I have had the unfortunate task of being an Assistant DA going with the homicide inspector to tell the homicide--to tell the victim's family their loved one is dead.  I have had family members hold me and I've held them when I said, you know we can't prove this case.  It does hurt and it's supposed to hurt.  That makes you--and I always tell young attorneys when you don't feel, when you walk in a court and you're not nervous anymore and you don't feel for that person regardless if you're defending someone or you're the prosecutor.  But if you don't feel that situation, then you need to get out of the business.  And you know let me just tell you there was a point in time I wasn't feeling it.  And this was a true story.  A very good friend of mine who is one of the psychologists on our panel, and she still is on the panel.  And it was not uncommon for Maryann to go and have lunch and say Teri and call me and I'd, you know, be in my office.  And this was when I was head of homicide.  And said, you know why don't I go pick up some lunch and we'll have lunch together in your office?  So one day Maryann walks, Maryann walks into my office and there were photographs of all these homicide scenes and autopsy photographs.  And she said I was sitting there just eating lunch and talking on the phone as though nothing was phasing me.  And she walked in, she sat down across from me and said it's time for you to go.  When you don't feel, then you need to get out, and she was right.  So here I am as a judge and I, as I said I'm in a unique position where I see the families.  I see many times after I have sentenced a child or a loved one to a great deal of time from twenty-five years, in some cases one hundred and-something years, to life.  And the parents--one mother came up to me and said I want you to know I was a good mother.  And you--I have to feel.  That makes, I think it makes me a better judge.  So what do I do?  You get off the bench and it's not like you have to let it go, but you have to have a support system.  Be it your colleagues, your loved one, to let it out.  And so that you can go on and do your job.  But I would never tell someone to not feel it because then you, you lose the reason why you're a judge.  Cause you've got to understand that what you say, what you do and what goes on in that courtroom impacts someone's life.  And if you don't feel that, then you don't need to be on the bench.
Story_ID: 1318
Speaker 1: Now there's another aspect of this too that's disturbing, and that's the courage it takes to be a judge these days, especially in light of some of the events of the last, I guess a couple of years there have been judges attacked.  One judge in Chicago [Illinois] was killed.
Speaker 2: Yes I know that story very well, and it reminds me of--I have a death threat and I've had it ever since I was a prosecutor and he raises his ugly head every once in a while.  And as soon as you said that, I'm thinking immediately of him, and it brings me back to reality of this man who was convicted of murder and wants me dead.  And in fact I was doing some back-to-back gang cases and murder cases and cases that had gang relations and apparently my name got out in the community.  And so it's, it's, it's there.  But it doesn't mean that you can't, that you should let it influence you.  Because you understand that it's just a--those are rumors.  You still have to do your job, and you still have to do the hardest job in the world.  And you know the hardest job in the world for a judge?  Is to be fair.  You know we all want to be fair, but you've got to work at it.
Speaker 1: This is true.  We always ask this question.  I think you've given us major components of it already, but what is your judicial philosophy?
Speaker 2: Oh my gosh, it's make sure one, to check my feelings and biases at the door, cause I have them, we all have them.  That when I take that bench, when I come through from the judge's chamber into that courtroom, it's checked.  I don't let it interfere with my trying to be fair.  And two, making sure both sides have a fair trial, that you have a voice that can be heard.  Now you know I get accused of well I wanted to talk about X, Y, Z.  Well that has no relevance to this case.  You've got to understand I'm going to follow the law and I'm going to make sure that the law applies fairly even though you may have a moral reason why you did what you did.  But it's not a legal justification for it.  And therefore we have to--in order for both sides, and not just the case that's before me to get a fair trial.  I have to apply it to the next case, and the next case.  So if I gave you special dispensation to do something, then I'm not going to be fair to the next case.  So therefore it makes it easy, just keep everybody on an equal playing field.
Speaker 1: Okay.  We have to pause again for a second.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: We're getting--we're wrapping down--
Story_ID: 1319
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now are you, are you satisfied now to retire as a Superior Court Judge, or do you have ambitions to go--
Speaker 2: Go on to something else?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I'd love--
Speaker 1: Not at this moment, I didn't mean at this moment.
Speaker 2: I loved being a trial lawyer, cause this is, I mean trial lawyer, listen to me--trial judge.  We're in the trenches.  It's like triage.  And you never know what's going to happen.  You don't--it's always the next trial and let's just do it and so there's that excitement.  Then there's, you know when I'm the trial attorney, I tried a lot--even for a civil attorney I tried one year five jury trials around the country.  And I remember saying to myself, you know this is for younger people.  And so have I gotten to that point where I'm saying this is for a younger person?  No.  But I love writing.  I'm fortunate to sit on the Appellate Panel for my Superior Court.  So maybe I might think about going on to doing appellate work, as an appellate justice, I don't know.  But I have the best job in the world and I have options.  I love teaching.  I teach at law schools, evidence and trial advocacy.  And I love trial advocacy because I guess my experience with that civil a lawyer when I was at Georgetown [University, Washington, D.C.], that I love encourage people to be attorneys, not to try to discourage them.  So do I have other aspirations after I retire?  Probably.  I'm always going to be in the law.  And what's very important to me is to help others to become a part of the profession.  That's why I believe in mentor programs even for new judges.  I'm always doing those kind of programs.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, now you teach at Hastings [University of California Hastings College of the Law]?
Speaker 2: Hastings and I've taught at USF [University of San Francisco] and San Francisco Law School, and I teach, I teach at judges' seminars and colleges and so forth, and I'm an invited lecturer to various law schools.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now do you, do you have any I guess interns you're the proudest of?  I don't want to get, get you in trouble or anything.
Speaker 2: Interns that I'm the proudest of?
Speaker 1: Right, you know, people--
Speaker 2: Who I have, I usually keep about four or five interns a semester.  And you know every semester I'm always proud of them.  I can say this:  Since I've been on the bench, 2002, I have averaged per semester four interns.  And every one of my interns have passed the bar the first time.  And so I'm very proud of that.  And I tutor a little bit, I mentor a little bit, so I'm very proud of that.  But anyone specifically in terms of gone on to great things?  I think someday you're going to see down the pike Maury Lee, and that's the name that comes out.  This--she's making a difference now.  She's only been in the profession for three years, but she's already a name to be reckoned with.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I'm proud that she worked with me.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now when you look back at everything you've done to this point, what are you the most proud of, or what do you think has made the most significant impact for the rest of the community?
Speaker 2: When I was a civil lawyer.  There was a group of people, and it was on '20/20' who had re--elderly people who had refinanced their home to build this mega church in San Francisco.  And they were losing their homes because they couldn't make the over-the-top interest payments and the church would not reimburse them.  There were seven families.  And what I was very proud of is that I saved their homes.  I was involved on the team that was able to save each and every one of their homes.
Speaker 1: How were you able to save their homes?
Speaker 2: Negotiating, litigating.  Well we negotiated with their banks, of course.  We put--the church went into bankruptcy.  We were, interestingly we were able to get the church to pay off before all the debts were wiped away, to pay off the church.  And it was mostly another woman and I basically talking to all the companies, the finance companies and renegotiating their loans.  And I was very proud of that.  And in fact many of the members still call me.  I'm invited to the weddings of their children, their grandchildren now.  And funerals, some of the members have passed away.  But they passed away in their homes, not out of their homes.
Speaker 1: It's amazing to me that you know, I guess, well people I guess do these things.  But that people pool their money in those kind of projects.  The Jonestown [the Peoples Temple Agricultural Project, Jonestown, Guyana] case was very similar.
Speaker 2: Yeah, you get these charismatic people who are ministers or in the name of ministry, and they're driving whatever and building these churches and, and these poor people are financing it in the name of God I guess, you know.  Or misuse of God in their religion, I should say.
Speaker 1: Now what's the, what's the name of that case?
Speaker 2: That case is, it's oh Lord now it's changed the name.  So I don't want to--it'll come to me.  Unfortunately, I can't think of the name right now.
Speaker 1: This was about 19--
Speaker 2: Oh, that was in 1976.
Speaker 1: 1976.
Speaker 2: It was featured in '20/20'.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now that's just before the--
Speaker 2: No excuse me, not '76 [1976].  It was in 19, I joined the firm in--1996.
Speaker 1: Ninety six [1996], okay.
Speaker 2: I joined the firm.  So that had to have happened like in two, 1999/2000.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Okay I'm sorry.  It's getting late in the day, I'm losing my--
Speaker 1: Did you appear on '20/20'?
Speaker 2: No I did not, no, no, no.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But the members did.

Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now what advice would you give to young, young people who want to be lawyers?
Speaker 2: Okay.  Unlike now, most law students, and I don't mean to say this to discourage them, do not--well let me back up.  Unfortunately a lot of people are going to law school and graduate programs because they can't get jobs.  So they just go to the next step.  And if you're going to go to law school, students should know that you're going to come out owing anywhere from $150 to $200, or over $200,000 in student loans.  So do not go to law school just for the sake of going to the next step because you don't have a job.  Cause I don't care what job you're going to get, that's a lot of debt.  We need, and particularly those of color, we need more of us in the profession.  I'm the first African American woman to be appointed in San Francisco Superior Court.  It was not until 2009/2010 that the next African American person, woman was appointed.  Our population is very small.  And when I look at the whole judiciary, it's still 76, 76% white males over the age of 50.  We do need more people of color and diversity.  Not just in race, but just in background, diversity in backgrounds.  Because that's who the people are coming--the communities coming before us.  So my advice to students, particularly those who are from lower socioeconomic status, those of color, women, and those who don't normally have representation, is that they make, they must take a long, hard look because it's very expensive and it's going to be very hard.  But there is such a need.  And if you've gone through that and said I'm willing to incur the debt.  I'm willing to put in the time and the hours, and I'm willing to go through the alienation or being the loneliness because you are going to be the first in your family.  And if you can make that commitment, then we need you, and we desperately need you.  You know I often say to my colleague Monica Wiley.  When she and I go to lunch, there's no one who looks like us sitting on the bench.  And that's not what we want.  We want people who look like us, who have had our background, who have had our experience because that's who's coming in our courtrooms.  We want them to know that there are people who understand what they're going through.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I want to, one of the--just it was--seems like an interesting case and I guess you can talk about it.  This is a recent case involving Spider Dan.
Speaker 2: I can't talk about it.
Speaker 1: You can't talk about Spider Dan?
Speaker 2: No, because he's on appeal.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I wish I could.
Speaker 1: This is a case where Spider Dan climbs the 301 Mission Street residential high-rise in September.
Speaker 2: Right, I just did that case.
Speaker 1: And that's the case before you right now--on appeal.
Speaker 2: It will probably go on appeal, so I am not allowed to talk about it.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: I'm sure you read a lot about it (laughs).
Story_ID: 1321
Speaker 1: Right, right, right.  Ma'am, tell us what are some of your hopes for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: My goodness.  I'm worried about our educational system.  We cannot, most of us cannot afford private schools.  I am a product of public education, and it's very important that our public education have the resources to train, to educate.  So I'm worried about that because most of the--when they talk about the cuts in our education, that's affecting our lower economic people, people of lower economic means, as well as people of color.  So I'm worried that they won't have the wherewithal or the resources to equip them for their future, and that they will be encouraged to move on.  I'm also concerned in terms of who's going to college and having--who's going on to our graduate schools.  It doesn't have to be law school, medical schools, veterinarian schools, and going to the next level.  I'm worried that there are not enough of us as role models to--we get tired, you know trying to--it's our obligation when we're here, those of us who are in these positions to do it.  But there's so few of us and we're spread so thin, that we're not getting to enough people to encourage them to move on and that they too can get here to be my colleague or to take my place.  So I'm worried right now.
Story_ID: 1322
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now tell me if there was, when you look back on everything that has happened so far in your life and the decisions you've made.  Are there, there any major decisions or activities that you would do differently now if you could?
Speaker 2: In my career?
Speaker 1: Well yeah in career I suppose.
Speaker 2: You know I think if I had to do it all over again in my career, I would do exactly what I did (laughs).  No, I probably would have stayed in civil a little longer before I joined the DA's [District Attorney] Office.  Probably would not have stayed in the DA's Office as long as I did to have more of a lengthier civil practice.  But no, no, I, I really, I like the path that I have taken.  Even that little divergence where I thought I was going for a Master's in Foreign Service.  I think that enlightened me to look at other legal professions, and I often talk about that with my jurors.  When I say you know I've had the opportunity of look--because I've studied or I've traveled in other countries to look at their legal profession and I always say we're not the best, and I am the first to tell you.  I always look at our legal profession as a work in progress, and but others try to emulate us.  So we're not perfect but I think we, we're pretty good.  We have the tools.  But it's very hard for me at this time to say that if I, I should have done it this way or I should have done it that way.  Cause I don't look back on it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now you've received many awards.  A. Phillip Randolph Institute, Rosina Tucker Award, the Community Service Award from the National Council of Negro Women, and there's a list of awards here.  But when you look back on your life, what today would you consider to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: I hope my legacy would be the following:  That I don't know how many students or how many people I've touched that when they say my name, that they say I was a straight shooter and I was there for them.  That would be my legacy.  I mean I could always point to my, what I did in the role of domestic violence and the legislation.  But I think my most important work and I feel that I've done a good job is that I was there when someone needed.  I didn't have to know them.  That they saw me as a role model and respected me, and that I had, I said something, I did something to have an impact on them.  And I remember one day a woman called me and her child was at risk in high school.  And she asked if she, she could bring that child by my courtroom.  I didn't know her from Adam.  But I said why not?  Someone did that for me.  And I talked to her daughter and I get letters now from the daughter that she's in college.  Now I'm not saying I did anything to change her mind or to, you know, put her on the right path.  But at least she heard from someone who had similar struggles through school, lack of confidence, and that's what I like to do and have that type of impact.  That would be a great legacy.
Story_ID: 1323
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now you're a member of the Charles Houston Bar Association, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Tell us about that.
Speaker 2: Charles Houston was very good for me, and I was also President of Black Women Lawyers.  Charles Houston is a African American Association for lawyers.  And many times we couldn't be members of the American Bar Association, so we had these organizations.  And it really is a good support and working group.  And you know when you just need to sit down and have a reality check to say look it's not me, it's them, and to share experiences, and to encourage and help each other, that's what this organization is about.  They have great scholarship funds and mentoring programs for new people of color who just need to get their foot in the door.  When I have, when I came back to the Bay area [California], I knew a lot of people, but I didn't know that many people in the legal profession.  And it was very helpful for--to be a member of it to help me cope with being a DA [District Attorney], to being in civil practice and so forth.  So it's a wonderful organization.  Now what I found to be my most mentoring and long lasting friendships came out of the Black Women Lawyers.  Because a lot of us came out of law school together and many of the women who I was members with in that organization, we're still very, very, very good friends.  And a lot of us are now on the bench.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And they are the reason, a lot of the founders of the Black Women Lawyers opened the door for me.  The President of the Black Women Lawyers, Chloe Hewlett (ph.) at the time when I came out, is a very good friend.  Shelly Wheeler Drake was President of Black Women Lawyers, Judy Johnson.  Estella Dooley who was African American woman in the San Francisco Public Defender's Office to prosecute homicide cases.  All of these women were members of that organization.  They should have been appointed to the bench.  They didn't because the timing, whatever, but they opened the door for me to benefit from their hard work.
Speaker 1: Okay.  The Charles Houston Bar, I mean Association, that's part of the National Bar Association?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: The local chapter?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 1324
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Well I want to ask you something about your family.  I know you're married now, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: You met your husband in what, 1990?
Speaker 2: We met each other in 2003, in 2003 and yeah.  And he, first thing--we, we met at a retirement dinner and the first thing I asked you're not a lawyer are you?  And he said no.  And I said fine (laughs).  And the rest is history.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  And now your parents, did your parents get--I know your father [Alson Jackson]  passed right after you--
Speaker 2: He went into a coma right, the day, the next day after I was sworn in as a judge.  So he saw me and he was in--he had, he had suffered a stroke in '85 [1985], '86 [196].  And he was in a convalescent hospital in the area, near the house.  And he went to every basketball game of my nephews and we can talk about them later.  But my nephews purposely went to Stanford [University, Palo Alto, California] so that their grandfather could go and watch their games.  And it was almost like Dad's dream had been realized.  Because he wanted one of his daughters to be a lawyer.  I guess he never said this to me, he wanted me to go on to become a judge.  And when he found out that I was appointed, he kept the whole month before I sworn in, he kept saying when I would come into his room, "Here comes the judge, here comes the judge."  And you have to understand I would come, I would see Daddy before work and I would see Dad after work and all during the weekend.  That's how my mother and I and my sister who lives in southern California, when she would come up.  And so we had the swearing in at his convalescent hospital in the garden, and it was beautiful.  It was a beautiful August day, or September day I should say.  And you know you had the formal investiture, but this was intimate with family and friends who had been there for me.  And he was in the front row smiling.  And every time someone would speak, he kept saying "Here comes the judge."  And he would tell--and when I was speaking, he was always yelling out judge.  And then the next day I got a call and he was in a coma.  And he died shortly after that.  So he was able to see his dream.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He lived for that.
Speaker 1: Now is your mother [Beatrice Jackson]  still living?
Speaker 2: My mother's still alive in the area, and my sister's married I southern California.  And my, you know I guess when you talk about legacy, not that I had anything to do with it.  I have two beautiful nephews who are twins.  They went to Stanford and they've been in the NBA[National Basketball Association] playing basketball, professional basketball for ten, almost 11 years.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  I guess you should name them probably.
Speaker 2: Jason and Jarron Collins.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  That's a beautiful story and I got one last question to ask before--well is there anything I haven't asked you that we need to deal with before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: No, I think we've--I think you've asked me everything, and I probably motor mouth on (laughs).
Speaker 1: Okay well the last question is similar to legacy, but a little bit different.  Ma'am how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: Interesting.  I know this sounds so cliche, but a good person.  I want to be remembered, and she always gave it her best.  That's how I want to be remembered.  On the bench, she was a well prepared judge and she was a fair judge, and that's about all I can ask for.  Among my students, that Professor Jackson was the toughest professor I've ever had, but I learned something from her.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Thank you very much for your time.
Speaker 2: Thank you.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Yay.  Hope that was okay.
Speaker 1: Oh that's fine.
Speaker 2: All right.
