 Finchum and I   m here in Helena, Oklahoma with  Melvin Welch, a 1928 graduate of Oklahoma Agricultural and  Mechanical College. This interview is being conducted as part of the  Oklahoma State University Library   s O-STATE Stories Oral History  Project. Today is October 13, 2008 and also present for the interview is  Juliana Nykolaiszyn, a librarian, and Jack Wedge, the son-in-law of Mr.  Welch. Thank you for having us today. You were just telling us about  driving so let   s start there.   Oh yeah, I   m a good driver. I started driving when I was eleven years  old, a Model-T. Didn   t have to have no driver   s license or nothing then.  He   ll get on the tractor if you don   t watch him. (Laughter)  I drove a Model-T from here to Great Bend, Kansas when I was just a  kid. Eleven years old, I think.  You yourself drove?  Well my folks were with me, but I could drive better than my dad so he  let me drive.  Did you have to sit up on something to be able to see     No no, not in a Model-T. You can see every place in a Model-T. That   s  the nice part about it. Model-T is the greatest car ever built, of course.  Well you still see a few old ones     That   s what put everybody on the roads. These old country roads  became   that   s really what built the roads. When they got the Model-T,  people demanded better roads and they got them, see.  5  Finchum  Welch  Finchum  Welch  Wedge  Welch  Wedge  Welch  Wedge  Welch  Wedge  Welch  Finchum  Welch  Wedge  They did.  But you could drive the Model-T in the mud. And then   it was a lot  better than driving a buggy and they were good mud cars. But they  wanted better roads, you know,    cause that   s why I guess.  We could probably use some on the section roads now, because there   s  still some not too good ones around.  We didn   t have nothing here but the section lines. No pavement.  He remembers the first car in Helena  Oklahoma .  What?  You remember the first car     Yeah.     that was here. You remember the     Dr. Madares.     the first airplane you ever saw too.  Dr. Madares had a two-cylinder Rio. And you cranked it from the side.  He was a doctor here, and he had the first one. Sounded kind of like a  John Deer tractor. It was a two-cylinder. I rode several times with him  when he   d come out by our place. He   d take me for a ride in his  automobile. Yeah that   s   but now, do you want me to tell you a story  about OSU?  Usually what I ask first is to tell about your youth and where you were  born. And then we   ll work our way up to OSU.  I was born two miles north of town here March 10, 1906. And I went to  school at a country school right on the same place as where our farm  was. Went through the eighth grade there. And then I got to high  school, and went to high school here in Helena and when we went to  high school here we had the old Connell State School of Agriculture  building. It was the prettiest building in Oklahoma at that time. They  tore it down you know. But I   ve got a picture of that someplace, but I  don   t     It   s out at the house.  6  Welch  Wedge  Welch  Wedge  Welch  Finchum  Welch  Finchum  Welch  Wedge  Welch  Finchum  Welch  Finchum  Welch  It is?  Yeah.  Well they   ve got pictures of it. It   s one of the prettiest buildings in  Oklahoma. They tore it down when they put up   a   oh a kid   s, what   s  it called? A place     An orphanage.  Orphanage, yeah. Orphanage. They put an orphanage there and then they  tore that building down which was a crying shame. It   s one of the  prettiest buildings in Oklahoma.  How many students were in your class then?  Oh, well, about thirty. You mean in high school?  Uh-huh.  Yeah, about thirty. About thirty or so. Yeah that   s about the size of my  class. We had a pretty good school here. It wasn   t like Capitol Hill in  Oklahoma City.  Tell them what football was like in those days.  Oh well football, we didn   t have grass fields to play on. We played on  hard ground with a few cinders on it. And then it had goatheads. You  know what a goathead is?  No, you tell us what a goathead is.  A goathead is a sticker. And it used to grow up, I think the railroads  hauled it in here. And they spread from the railroad track when the trains  come through. But it was catching a tire, and if it broke off a tire, then  wherever it would put a seed and grow. It used to be thick around here.  Now I don   t ever see one anymore. That was way back there in 1920,  somewhere in there. And they didn   t spread like people thought they  would. They were really afraid of them. But they   re gone. We don   t  have any now. I don   t see a one of them.  Well how did your parents come to be in Helena?  Well my parents, my dad he was originally from Monticello, Illinois.  And he came down through Kansas. Worked his way through on ranches  and stuff. And he was too young to make the run when they made the  7  Finchum  Welch  Finchum  Welch  Finchum  Welch  Finchum  Welch  Finchum  Welch  run here. But he bought what they call a relinquishment from one of his  relatives that went through. So he got the farm, 160 acres out here that  he had to live on at least a year, I think. I think he had to live on it for a  year to prove it up. You had to have your house, you had to live on it   the land . So they had a dug-out. And had it covered over with logs and  a kind of roof and a stove inside. And they kept warm and it was  comfortable because the weather here then was, well we had blizzards  and we haven   t had a blizzard like that   a white-out you know. I don   t  know where you girls are from, but did you ever see a blizzard? A real     No I haven   t.  Well you go north, you still get one in Nebraska, but we haven   t had the  bad weather here like that in a long time. But it snows so hard that you  can   t see hardly anything. And the snow is blowing, the winds blowing  high. When that snow hits your face you can feel it, it cuts your face,  you know. And then it does that for a whole day or something. And the  roads are all drifted full of snow and then it takes   then it took a week  or two to   well, of course, we had horses and wagons then. We just  pulled and made a track through the snow on the roads and open up the  roads that way. Sometimes you   d just drive through fields to get to town.  But we don   t have those storms anymore. We haven   t had one like that  for a long time here, what we call a blizzard. People in Nebraska, you  know, it   s so bad there that you have to tie a string from your house to  the barn or you   ll get lost. The snow is snowing so hard you can   t see  nothing.  I   m glad we don   t have those anymore.  Well it   s nice that we don   t have those anymore. And it   s cold too up  there too. Gets colder up there than here.  So did you have brothers and sisters on the farm with you?  Well I did have, you see all my brothers and sisters are dead. My sister  was three years older. And I had a brother three years younger, and I  had brother six years younger and they   re both dead. So I   m the only  one left out of the     Did they all go to high school here in Helena?  Yeah they all went to high school here in Helena.  Once you got out of high school, what did you do?  Well my mother decided that we were going to go to college. So one day  8  Finchum  Welch  Wedge  Welch  Finchum  I   when I was out of school they took me down to Oklahoma A M on  Sunday afternoon in a Model T and helped me find a room next to the  campus and unloaded my trunk with what little I had in it and went  home. And I was there Monday morning, had to go enroll. So I went  down there to enroll in the School of Music. And so I started down the  enrollment line and a man says,    Have you had piano?    and I said,    No  sir.    I went down a little farther and a women said, she   s writing  something down too,    Have you had voice?    and I said    No, ma   am.     So I decided I was in the wrong place, so I went over and enrolled in the  School of Agriculture because I grew up on a farm, so I knew a little bit  about that.  But I wish I   d have stayed in the School of Music because I could have  been a pretty good pianist. I took piano in the School of Music in my  senior year at OSU and I did real good, even in my senior year. I should  have stayed with it. I learned the rudiments and played a little bit for my  own amazement you know. But I   m not a pianist. I belonged to the  Oklahoma A M Glee Club four years. They had a voice teacher down  there, and I scheduled voice and his name was John Brigham. And he  was a tenor. And he was the best tenor I ever heard, I think. None of our  kids in the Glee Club, when we had a quartet or anything, he had to sing  the high tenor parts. It wasn   t made up of students, but they would  generally have students in the quartet. But parts like these that were real  difficult, roles like high tenor was hard to sing. But he could sing them.  Did you have to try out for that?  Well, I went to take a voice lesson from John Brigham and when I got  through he said,    I want you to show up here at 7:30. You   re in the Glee  Club.    And I was the only one who didn   t have to try out for the Glee  Club. I was in it and I spent all four years and made all the trips with  them. We had a Pullman down on the track in Stillwater and there were  no buses then and they   d hook an engine on that and pull it up on the  main lines and we could go wherever we wanted to go you know. One  time we went as far as St. Louis to the, oh what was it     Missouri Valley, I think.  Missouri Valley, yeah. Missouri Valley contest. We didn   t win it, but  that   s the first time I ever saw the Mississippi River was when we went  to St. Louis. But we had a good time. We went all over Oklahoma and  Kansas with our Glee Club and with our program. And we played a lot.  We were in demand in a lot of places. We had good entertainment.  Do you have a favorite song from that time period?  9  Welch  Finchum  Welch  Finchum  Welch  Finchum  Welch  Wedge  Welch  Finchum  Welch  Finchum  Welch  Wedge  Welch  Finchum  Welch  God   s Acre, Roses of Picardy, Don   t Bite the Hand that Feeds you and I  can sing the old Oklahoma Song. Have you ever heard that?  I have not.   Begins singing  I give you a land of sun and flowers, and summer the  whole year long. I give you a land where those golden hours roll by to  the mockingbird   s song. Where the cotton blooms    neath the southern  sun and the vintage hangs thick on the vine. A land whose story has just  begun this wonderful land of mine. Oklahoma, Oklahoma, fairest  daughter of the west. Oklahoma, Oklahoma,    tis the land I love the best.  We have often sung your praises but we have not told the half. So I give  you Oklahoma,    tis a toast we all can quaff.  Ends singing   That   s great. I   ve never heard it. That   s good.  You   ve never heard that song?  But you do it quite well.  That used to be the state song. See it was the state song until  Hammerstein and what   s his name     Rogers.  Well Rogers and Hammerstein, they wrote one that took the place of it.  But that   s still the best Oklahoma state song.  I think so too. Especially when you sing it.  Yeah. Well...  So you were at OAMC in the    20   s?  Yeah I got out there in    24?     24-   28.     24-   28 is when I was down here. Yeah.  Just out of curiosity, why OAMC over OU?  Well, because I was a farmer. And that was an agricultural and  mechanical school. And I was not going to be a doctor. I didn   t think I  had the qualifications to be a doctor and the doctors all went to OU. And  we had, our banker here was an OU man, Web Glidewell, he played  10  Finchum  Welch  Finchum  Welch  Finchum  Welch  Finchum  Welch  Finchum  Welch  Finchum  Welch  football with OU. But I decided I   d rather go to Oklahoma A M. So  that   s where I went, Oklahoma A M. But we   I went down there and  enrolled and I was in the School of Agriculture, although I wanted to be  in the School of Music but I   except the senior year I was scheduled  piano in my senior year. I made it all right. I had a good teacher. I had a  teacher from Cambridge University. She was really good. And she and I  got along pretty good. She didn   t chew me out to much, you know. If  she had I probably would have quit.  Well do you remember how much tuition was?  Wasn   t anything then. We didn   t have tuition. You just go down there  and buy your books and pay your   oh there might have been a little fee  but it wasn   t prohibitive like it is now. I think that   s awful. I think  everybody ought to be able to go down to school without paying that  high tuition. Of course that tuition that they make you pay now, you  have to pay your professors that talk to you. You   ve got to pay their  salaries, that   s what they use it for.  Did you have a part time job while you were there?  Well, yeah 25 cents an hour. I was in the School of Agricultural  Economics, and the Professor was J.T. Sanders, Dr. J.T. Sanders. And  we crunched numbers mostly out of the USDA yearbooks. And we got  information for bulletins they   d write. They had a rule then you publish  or perish. I guess it   s still that way.  Oh yes.  The students would all   get all   do all the outside work. Crunching the  numbers, everything and then give it to him and set it up. Then he would  write his bulletin from that and he got the credit for the bulletin and we  got the grade for getting the     Doing the work.     getting the numbers. That   s the way it was.  Well where did you live?  In Stillwater?  Yes.  I lived in a private home about, I don   t know, it was a couple blocks  north east of the campus. Yeah, northeast of campus. Their names were  11  Delzell. They had a daughter, and then there was a girl from Lamont that  stayed there. Faye Mounts was her name. I still remember her. And so  we lived, I know there came a lightning storm one morning and it struck  a house right close to us. And it blew all four walls out and there was  five girls up in the upstairs. And they started to go downstairs and they  couldn   t get the door open and they turned around and all the walls were  out. Everybody (Laughter)   they were just there. And the fire  department had to get them out of there. There was one boy I remember  one morning he was walking right northeast of the campus there, used to  be Swim   s. Swim   s was the gathering place, a drug store.  And he was walking along the street and the lightning struck and blew  his shoes off. But he didn   t know what hit him. There was just a black  spot on that sidewalk where that lightning hit him. But that was   but we  had quite a time there at   first started out   of course, everybody has to  take the same courses when you first enroll. You have some requireds  that you had to take, one of them is chemistry, and English, and I forget  now what some of the other stuff was but about three or four other  courses. The English department, they had to take the agriculture  students for the English part of it. See everybody was required to take  English, so the English department had to take   and then they called  them, Aggies, and they never did like them, you know. Because they  didn   t know how to talk anyway, you know, these farmers.  I remember one morning in English class, why, the teacher, her name is  Ms. Nash, and she telling everybody how she wanted our names written  on the theme and how to fold the paper and everything. So some guy in  class, he was an old country boy like I was, and he said    Ms. Nash, how  come you want us to do it that way?    It made her mad you know, and  she said,    You just remind me of my little nephew. Always asking what  when, where, and why.    She said,    I think that   s a foolish question.  Class don   t you think that   s a foolish question. How many think that   s a  foolish question raise your hand.    I raised my hand and she   there was  about five or six of us and she sent us all out of the room and told us we  had F   s in English. And so we didn   t know what to do. So we went over  to the Dean   s office. Dean Dowell was the Dean of Agriculture at that  time. Dowell, D-O-W-E-L-L. And we walked in his office and told him  we   d been thrown out of class and he was sitting there with his feet up  on the desk, you know. He laughed. He said,    You boys have made my  day.    He said,    She won   t flunk you.    He said,    Go back to class.    So  we didn   t do very good in English, but we did get by.  The English department hated the Aggies, you know because the lower  echelon of the English department teacher is the one who got the Aggies.  Of course the good teachers, they stayed within the school, one of the  schools of commerce and a little bit. I don   t know, a different breed of  12  Finchum  Welch  Finchum  Welch  people. So that   s the way   the English department they just hated to get  those Aggies, you know. That   s the nearest I   ve ever come to getting  thrown out of class. We never really could write a theme. I know that  there was a kid there whose name was Florence Clark. They were from  Helena and Florence Clark was an English major. And everything she  did was perfect as far as English is concerned. So she would write our  themes and she wrote her brother   s themes. So he would come home and  thought he   d have some fun. He always got A on his themes you know.  So he was coming home and he marked on an F on it. He came home  and he says, he says,    Look here, something   s wrong here. They marked  an F on my theme and you wrote it.    She just hit the ceiling, you know.  She was going to go back there and chew that teacher out before they  got her calmed down. It was just a joke. That   s a   the English  department I remember they   the English department they hated to get a  bunch of Aggies.  Let   s see, Whitehurst Hall was built when I was down there. It was west  of the road then. There was a road that came right straight by   a  highway. Right down the center of there. Whitehurst Hall was on the  west side. Just built brand new. And then another old building out there  called Agriculture Engineering building. And then on out northwest of  that was the poultry farm. And then on a little farther was the dairy farm  up there. And of course I haven   t been down there in so long, I wouldn   t  even know my way around on campus. They   ve got all new buildings.  They   ve got a   I guess they   ve got the prettiest campus of any school I  know of.  It   s pretty. Whitehurst is still there.  A lot nicer than OU.  Well the dairy barn they just   or the dairy building, they just tore it  down this past spring.  Well when I was there, that was the first time   they were just getting  the veterinarian school underway. And a cow had eaten some steel and  got some in her rumen, instead of in her stomach. And they   ve got four  stomachs. And she was going to die. So they anesthetized her and cut  her open and took that piece of steel out. That was the first time the  Veterinarian department ever operated on a cow like that. And then they  became a good veterinarian school down there. They really do  everything now. But they thought that was one of the wonders of the  world when they operated on a cow. They cut a hole in her and took that  piece of iron out or whatever she had eaten and she didn   t die. They  knew she was going to die, but that was the only way they could save  her, so they operated on her.  13  Finchum  Welch  Finchum  Welch  Finchum  Welch  Finchum  Welch  Finchum  What about sports from that time?  Well the sports   when I was down there why Johnny Maulbetsch, he  was an All-American football player from Michigan and he was the  coach. And of course the players down there were walk-ons then. They  didn   t have to have a weight record and all that stuff like they have now.  You have to be a bruiser to get on that football team down there now.  Not then. It was walk-ons. Guys that could make the team, made it.  And so we had, I never did make the team and I never was much in  sports. But I knew all the good wrestlers. I wrestled with the world  champions when Ed Gallagher was the coach and I had a lot of fun out  there on the mat in the old gymnasium.  And we had to take two years of ROTC, and the Army runs   two Army  captains run the ROTC. Their names are Captain Smith and Colonel  Ronayne. I still remember them    cause they were tough. They were  Army   they were old army people, you know. They would chew you  out. They chewed me out and I got in trouble two or three times.    Cause  I   d talk back, see.  What did you do for fun?  Well that was about it. I would go out and wrestle and then they had  games on the campus. They had push ball and on Saturdays why they  had, I don   t know, a    thousand    kids out there. And a great big ball  about 4 or 5 foot in diameter all under pressure. And they start that thing  on one end and there was about as many as one was on each side to get  that ball to the next goal. That was a rough game. Those people got  hurt. I   ll tell you what, they were really rough.  I don   t know that I   ve ever heard of it.  Push ball.  In push ball there were two rows of kids and when the signal  was given, they all ran to the ball and tried to push it to the goal. It was a  rough game and people got hurt bouncing off the ball.   Push ball.  Yup. Yeah it was rough. It was rough. And then I had, of course I had  Glee Club practice all the time. I was with the Oklahoma A M Glee  Club. I made all the trips with them. And we had lot of practices. The  director of that Glee Club was John Brigham. I don   t know whatever  happened to him. He was really a good singer. He was a high tenor  singer.  Did you come home much during     14  Welch  Finchum  Welch  Wedge  Welch  Finchum  Welch  Yeah, I   d come home quite often. All we had then was a Model-T. And  my brother and I, he was three years younger than I am, we finally  bought a Model-T down here. I think we gave him five dollars for it and  we drove that Model-T to Stillwater and back several times. Model-T  Ford. And I remember one night we knocked the rod out of it. I called  my dad here in Helena. And we were just leaving Stillwater and the rod  went out and so I stopped and telephoned. I got him on the telephone  and told him to meet us    cause we were going to be along the road some  place. So I kept driving and kept a driving, and right down here   right  down south of Helena here, where you curve to come in, we met him.  Just a mile from home. But a Model-T was   we never did start that  Model-T again.  There weren   t that many cars on campus then.  No, no. There were hardly any cars on campus. Now, I know when I had  that old car down there, guys were always wanting to use it. One night  just before we came home, they wanted to borrow my car. I said    well,  I   ve got it filled full of gasoline. I   m going home tomorrow.       Ah well,  we   ll fill it full of gasoline.    So they took the car. Next morning I went  out, got it started, and started home. And I got it home and let it set, get  cold again, it wouldn   t start. So what they had done, they had just filled  it full of kerosene. They didn   t put gasoline back in it. It ran hot enough  after it had enough gasoline in it to start it, after it got hot, why it would  burn kerosene. But they had filled it full of kerosene and then it  wouldn   t start. And that   s the last time I ever drove that one   that  Model-T.  He used to ride the passenger train home too. Tell them about that.  What? Oh yeah. Well yeah, so many times I hitchhiked from Stillwater  to Helena and there wasn   t much traffic on the road. A lot of times there  would be a farmer with a load of something on a wagon, and I   d go up to  Bill   s Corner, twelve miles north of Stillwater and start walking toward  Perry. And a guy come along, letting me ride one night and we saw a  car coming so he said,    If you want to get on, you better flag him  down.    So I flagged him down and he took me on into Perry. And then I  caught the Frisco passenger train from there to Helena. That   s the way I  got home several times, was to do that. The way we   d get home was on  the Frisco through here. It   s the Burlington-Northern now that goes  through here. But that was a way. We either hitchhiked, we didn   t have  no car but most of the times we hitchhiked home.  Did your parents go to campus very often?  No. My parents   fact is, I played high school football and my dad never  did see me play a football game. He didn   t care nothing about it. The  15  Wedge  Welch  Finchum  Welch  Wedge  Welch  Wedge  Welch  Wedge  Welch  Wedge  doctor said you   re crazy for playing football, says you might drop dead  at any time. So he wasn   t sold on football. But I liked to play football  so that   s what I played, high school football. I never did make the  college team but I had a lot of fun playing football in high school. I  loved it.  Did they come out for your graduation?  Oh yeah, they were there for my graduation.  After you graduated, what did you do?  Well, first thing I got was a job teaching vocational agriculture at Merritt   Oklahoma . That was a big consolidated school southwest of Elk City   Oklahoma . And I forget now how big that school is   it   s terrifically  big. It was in the country, but it was a big school. So I taught  vocational agriculture there and then I taught vocational agriculture at  Cheyenne  Oklahoma , and then after I quit at Cheyenne, I went to work  for the Soil Conservation Services, and I was with them for, I don   t  know, fifteen or twenty years. And then I ended up teaching school in  Wichita  Kansas . And my wife was a school teacher. She liked to  teach school, so we went to Wichita and got a job teaching school. They  were glad to have us.  Tell them the story about when the state agriculture guy came to your  father-son banquet. Do you remember that? Out at Merritt?  Uh     Perky.  Perky, oh yeah, Jim. Oh yeah well, of course he was kind of a rough  guy, you know. He was a state supervisor of vocational agriculture but  he came to my father-son banquet and it was in a church one night at  Merritt. They kept after him to talk, and he wouldn   t get up to say  anything. But they just kept dogging him about wanting to hear a  speech. So it kind of made him mad, you know. And he got up and he  said,    Ladies and Gentleman,    he says,    I   m just like        Marc Anthony.        Marc Anthony...    He said,       went to Cleopatra   s house at three  o   clock in the morning.    He said,    I didn   t come here to talk.    Then he  sat down, and they didn   t ask him no more.  That was his speech.  16  Welch  Finchum  Welch  Wedge  Welch  Finchum  Wedge  Welch  That was his speech.  What did you do for the Soil Conservation?  Well I was with the Soil Conservation. I was a conservationist. I was  classified as a soil conservationist. We were paid by the federal  government. That was a good job. I worked for them for about fifteen or  twenty years. I get a little stipend now from the Soil Conservation  Service. And then we went to school in Wichita  Kansas . We drove  into Wichita   well we drove to Kiowa  Kansas  first and then Haysville  and then we went into Wichita, and I walked into a school it   s called     it   ll come to me pretty soon. I can   t remember the name of it. Anyways  I walked in and the superintendent said,    How can I help you?    And I  said,    Well I   m looking for a job teaching school.    And he reached  down into a drawer and pulled out an application and he said,    Sign  here.    He said,    You   re hired.    But it was a tough school year.  You ought to tell him about the CCC camp down in Geary  Oklahoma .  Yeah, I started with the CCC camp in Geary. I helped start the Civilian  Conservation Corp. Well I lived at Geary then. We had a big camp there,  about 200 boys, I think. The Army took care of the boys at night. They  took care of all their physically needs and saw they were fed. But in the  morning they turned them over to us   to the officials of the  conservation district there, the corp that we worked for. And we   d have  to take them out and put them to work and then bring them back in at  night. They had some rigid rules, too. Because if it rained and you got  them wet then they   d catch a cold, then you were in trouble. The boys  they   d carry a brick along and if it was ten drops on brick, then it was  time to go in. It was time to come in when there were ten drops on a  brick, I still remember that. We took care of a lot of kids out there at the  CCC camp. We had kids of all ages. We had some highly   I wouldn   t  say highly educated, but they were skilled. We had one   we hired one  old man there and he got in. He   d go out and take a post   a bodark post   wood . That   s a   you know what a bodark is, don   t you?  No.  Hedgeapple  tree .  Yeah, they are the hardest post  wooden  there is, but they   re crooked.  But they will not rot in the ground. And he   d go out and get one of those  post and start whittling and he   d come out with a bow   a bow and arrow  with it all polished, the prettiest thing you   d ever seen. He could sell  those things for  100 in Oklahoma City. So he made a lot of those bows.  And then we had another kid who could draw. He was a good artist. He  17  Finchum  Welch  Wedge  Welch  Wedge  Welch  Finchum  Welch  Finchum  Welch  Finchum  Welch  could draw anything. And he was good. There wasn   t anything he  couldn   t do on that art. But they didn   t have any place to go. They  could sleep and eat there and they had a good bed. They had good  health facilities because we had a doctor. And good place to sleep. And  it was really a godsend for the people who really needed it.  How long would they stay there?  Well, they   d stay there until   I don   t remember they had any set time,  but they could leave anytime they wanted to. And finally the whole thing  was dissolved and they   ve done away with the whole thing pretty quick.  Do you know what the CCC program was all about?  Civilian Conservation Corp.  Coming out of the Depression, see that was one of Roosevelt   s     Yeah, Roosevelt was the one I think who started it. They   d pick up  anybody that needed a place to sleep and needed something to eat, and  put them to work. We planted trees a lot   we planted trees and we   d  plant what they call shelter belts, and do conservation work on farms.  We had trucks and everything. But for the guy who was down and out,  they paid him so much a month and he had a place to sleep and eat and  that was something in those days.  Sure, what   s a shelter belt?  What?  What is a shelter belt?  Shelter belt. Well, that   s a row of trees along the edge of a farm to keep  the land from blowing away. We   d plant trees along the property lines of  farms and then the trees would keep the wind from blowing the top soil  away.  So you   d plant them on certain sides?  Yeah, well we   d plant them east and west, mostly along the property  lines. And we got our trees from the U.S. government. I know one time I  got into trouble, almost got fired. The Army had to have the boys in the  camp and when it was raining and bad weather, why, the Army had to  entertain them and feed them and they   d get tired of them, you know. So  they   d come over one day to our section and they wanted us to take the  boys someplace and put them to work. Well I said,    I don   t know what  18  Finchum  Welch  Finchum  Welch  Finchum  Welch  Finchum  Welch  we   ll do, but we   ll do something.    So we got a truck and some barrels  and took them down to the Canadian river bottom down south of Geary  and we picked up walnuts. And we picked up several barrels of walnuts.  And then I came up to the camp and the boys were getting those walnuts  eaten. And the superintendent said,    Well you better do something  about those walnuts. They   re all going to be gone. Every night they  come in and fill up their pockets with walnuts,    and he said,    The  walnuts are not going to last long.    So I planted them all.  They had a place in the camp ground there and I made some rows and  covered them up and I think everyone of them came up and they were  walnut trees. And so we began to plant walnuts. And one day I got a  letter from the government and it said,    We noticed that in your reports  that you   ve been planting walnuts. Where did you get those walnut  trees? You didn   t order them from us?    And so I told them,    Well we  picked them up.       Well, you can   t do that. If that ever happens again,  well you   re out of here.    So that ended the walnut planting deal. We  planted a lot of walnut trees. And the walnuts were just thick down there  south of Geary on the river, you know. In the war, why, they used to cut  nearly all the walnuts for gunstocks. They made gunstocks out of the  walnut. They had some beautiful gun stocks. But all the Army rifles  they had then   at least what they had there, south of Geary. I don   t  know how many trees they cut, but they cut a lot of them. But they all  went to make gunstocks for these rifles. But that was, Geary was   it  was nice, nice camp down there, just south of Watonga  Oklahoma .  That would have been in the late 30   s 40   s.  Don   t ask me that. I don   t keep track of those years. You know cause     That   s about right.  I know what year I was born in and that   s about it.  And what year you graduated from OAMC.     24 in Helena and    28 in Oklahoma A M   Oklahoma A M college.  So did either one of your children go to OAMC or OSU?  Yeah, I had a brother that went there, graduated from there I guess. He  was a   I was in agriculture economics and he was in A.H., animal  husbandry. And so we had a couple profs  professors  there that were  well known all over the world, Dr. Blizzard and I can   t think of the other  guy   s name. Oh, Thompson, Hog Thompson because he was a hog  expert so they just called him Hog, Hog Thompson. And he took care of  19  Finchum  Welch  Finchum  Welch  Finchum  Welch  Finchum  Welch  Finchum  all the swine. He was in charge of all that, you know. So they sent my  brother with him to Chicago, to the Chicago show. And so he said that  some of them got out and they thought they were gone. But he said I  went out and all   I rounded up four hogs and got them back in the pen.  And he said they got first. So you could get in a lot of trouble with Hog  Thompson cause he was supposed to be responsible for those hogs, you  know.  About how many hogs would the campus have?  Oh they had   they had   I don   t know how many they had. But they had  a hog breeding program that, you know, you could buy the best there as  far as bloodlines were concerned. And the same way with cattle, dairy  cattle especially, Holsteins.  And they had horses back then too?  Yeah they had horses. I didn   t have much to do with the horses, mostly  the cattle. Let   s see, I   m trying to think of something else that I     anyway, the president lived right on the campus in Stillwater. He lived  right on the campus. His name was Knapp and his house was right on  the campus and he was bald headed. I remember I was with a bunch one  night and one guy called him up and said,    Dr. Knapp, it   s all off.    And  Dr. Knapp said,    What   s all off?    And he said,    The hair on your head.     And then he hung up, you know. (Laughter). So they didn   t know who  that was.  Anyway we ran across the campus one night to a fire. And they had  some barbed wire strung up between trees to protect flowers. And two  or three of us ran into that barbed wire and it cut us across the stomach,  you know. We had to go to the infirmary and the infirmary reported to  Dr. Knapp. Dr. Knapp, he made all the people that had put that wire up  to take it down that night. They had to get out at night and take that wire  down. He didn   t think about anybody running into that wire. But we  heard the fire whistles and we were going to the fire.  To help or to watch?  What did you say?  To help or to watch the fire?  We went to help, we wouldn   t miss that, you know.  Well was Theta Pond there?  20  Welch  Wedge  Welch  Wedge  Welch  Wedge  Finchum  Wedge  Welch  Wedge  Welch  Wedge  Welch  Finchum  Welch  Wedge  Welch  Wedge  Welch  Wedge  Welch  Yeah, Theta Pond was there. It was just mud hole up there in the  southwest corner up there by that girl   s dormitory.  Was that what it was called?  Theta Pond, yeah.  Do you know what its original name was?  No.  The Horse Pond. That   s what they told us over at Jessica   s orientation.  Have you ever heard that?  No.  That   s what they told us.  Well they might have called it Horse Pond     I mean way back, you know.  Yeah.  She had asked awhile ago about your kids. If any of your kids went to  school there. Like Mark and Melva?  Well, my daughter went to school at OSU, and I went to school at  Oklahoma A M. She graduated from OSU.  What about grandchildren?  Well Jack, you   ve got how many?  Four.  Four. And one of them lives in Norway. I   ve been over in Norway.  Twice. You   ve been to Norway, twice.  And one is a violinist. That   s   two of them are violinists.  Violin and Viola.  Ben   s the viola, isn   t he?  21  Wedge  Welch  Wedge  Welch  Finchum  Welch  Finchum  Welch  Wedge  Finchum  Welch  Wedge  Finchum  Welch  Finchum  Welch  Wedge  Welch  Finchum  Yeah.  And the other one belongs to the   what   s the name of that organization  again?  Air Force.  Air Force, yeah. He   s in the Air Force and he   s a violinist in the Air  Force band.  So music runs in the family?  Yeah, kind of.  Just like OSU.  They really good, Oh man, I mean to tell you. They   re really good  violinists.  They   re professionals.  I   d say OSU, the Big Orange, runs in the family, too.  Yeah.  The bad thing is none of his grandkids went to OSU but his great  granddaughter is down there now.  Well, that   s good. So do you keep up with sports now?  I kind of keep up with it. I know that OSU won their last game. Beat  Missouri.  It was tough too, wasn   t it?  Yeah. Anytime you beat Missouri, you   re doing good, I   ll tell you.     Cause Missouri   s a dirty team. (Laughter) I remember Missouri. We  hated playing Missouri because they were always dirty. They never were  fair about anything.  You probably shouldn   t print that. (Laughter) But it   s true.  Yeah. Missouri is   they   re a tough school to beat.  Well did you spend much time in the Library?  22  Welch  Finchum  Welch  Finchum  Nykolaiszyn  Finchum  Welch  Finchum  Welch  Finchum  Wedge  Finchum  Welch  Wedge  Finchum  Wedge  Welch  Not enough. Like the guy said, I was about ready to graduate before I  knew where the Library was.  I   m not sure where the library was back in    20   s either.  Well, um     That was before William   s Hall. Does that sound right? Or maybe it was  in the bottom of the biology building.  Old Central?  I don   t know if it was in Old Central or not. Did you have any classes in  Old Central?  Yeah, I had a vocational agriculture class in Old Central. I taught  vocational agriculture when I got out of college. Let   s see, now that was  19     1928  I got a job at Merritt which was a consolidated school  outside of Elk City. You ever hear of Merritt?  I   ve heard of Elk City. I don   t know about Merritt.  Well.  We hadn   t heard of Ringwood?  Ringwood?  Ringwood either.  Ringwood   s right south of us here.  They had to come   that was their path.  That   s the way we came.  Yeah.  Yeah, Ringwood. Ringwood was a very important town when the strip  opened here. They had wood and water down there. People would fan  out from Ringwood and come out here on the prairie. The prairie here  was without any trees, you know, because the fires. The prairie would  catch fire and then it would kill all the trees. And that   s the reason why  there wasn   t any trees here until man started settling here and handling  the fire. They quit having those fires. But when the country was lush  with grass, and the grass died. The great big tall grass, it was like a  23  Finchum  Welch  Finchum  Welch  Nykolaiszyn  Welch  Wedge  Welch  Wedge  Welch  Finchum  Welch  forest fire when a high wind was behind it. You couldn   t run fast  enough to get away from a grass fire. I mean it was terrible. And it  would burn everything in its path if you hadn   t made arrangements. The  settlers would cut the grass from away around their house. They   d cut it  so short, it wouldn   t burn their house down, you know. But if you didn   t  do it, and you got caught in one of those prairie fires, you   re in trouble.  Well how did they cut the grass?  Uh well, they had   the only thing they had was what they called a  mowing machine. You pulled it with a team of horses. And it had a  sickle on it running back and forth. It had about a six foot blade on it, I  guess. And you pull it and it cut and they could take a scythe, you  know. Do you know what I scythe is?  I know what a scythe is.  You know what a scythe was. Good. You know what a scythe is  asking  Juliana ?  No.  Well a scythe is a great big blade you use. It   s got two hand holds on it.  And it   s got a great big blade, a hooked blade, kind of a hooked blade  that   s three foot, two and a half, three foot long. And you could swing  that right down against the ground and cut. It   s kind of hooked and you  just cut grass. People used to cut their wheat with it. Cut that, and then  they   d gather it all up and make a bundle out of it. And then wrap it with  some more wheat and stack it up. And that   s the way   before they had  binders, that   s the way they cut their wheat.  There   s an old classic painting of a guy harvesting wheat, if you   ve ever  seen it.  Yeah.  They called it the reaper or something like that.  Yeah. Well when the binder was first invented it was called the reaper.  What is that T. Boone  referring to the STATE magazine with T. Boone  Pickens on the cover ?  Yes, that   s Mr. T. Boone.  T. Boone, T. Boone Pickens.  24  Wedge  Finchum  Wedge  Welch  Finchum  Welch  Finchum  Welch  Finchum  Welch  Wedge  Finchum  Welch  Finchum  Welch  Wedge  Finchum  Welch  Wedge  While he   s getting that, I   ll tell you a quick   he   s married. His first  wife, who is from here, died about 20 years ago and then he remarried in  the early    90   s to her sister. But she is kind of under the weather and her  kids have her over in Missouri right now, kind of recuperating. She   s  only 92.  She   s a spring chicken. You robbed the cradle.  Yeah. I   ll see if we have a picture here of both of them together. I don   t  know. Surely we do. Maybe we don   t.  Oh yeah, there   s my wife   s picture there with the     That   s a very good picture.  Yeah.  Yeah, I bet she could tell us some secrets about you.  Yeah she   I know, I   m glad she   s not here. (Laughter) She   d be saying,     I don   t know why you are doing all that lying for.     I hope she gets to feeling better.  Well, I don   t know. You know when you get to be in the 90   s, why,  anything can happen to you. Of course I   m 102 now, and I   m still going.  But I got to.  Here   s a good picture of them right there.  What did you do to celebrate your birthday this year?  Well I had a   down here   they had a big dinner down here at the  Baptist church. And invited everybody in.  I noticed last year you went up in a plane.  Yup, where is my plane picture?  It   s probably out at the house, I imagine. I   m pretty sure.  I   d been afraid to go up in a homemade plane.  You would? Well     That   s Martha  finds a photo of Melvin and Martha .  25  Finchum  Welch  Wedge  Finchum  Welch  Finchum  Welch  Finchum  Welch  Finchum  Welch  Finchum  Welch  Finchum  Welch  Wedge  Oh, she   s precious.  With the guys that build these homemade planes, they fly them a lot. So  they   re pretty safe. They know how to fly and they know how to build  an airplane. So I go up in them every once in a while.  I asked the old boy, I didn   t know. I asked about the airplane. I said     Were you a pilot in World War II?       Cause he   s 85. He said,    No, I  built it myself and taught myself to fly.     Yeah, I think I would not     Yeah it's   I   ve got some, let   s see where that is. Yeah, this is the  program I was in at Oklahoma City.  From the Centennial Celebration?  Yeah, from the Centennial Celebration.  Well tell us a little bit about that.  Oh yeah, here   s the letter that I got from the Centennial Celebration     So tell us a little bit about that day, getting to go sing in front of all those  people.  Well. It really didn   t bother me very much because I was with Willard  Scott  TV personality . And he kind of introduced me and so I had a  good pianist. And I don   t know, about 17,000 people there. It was in the  Ford Center in Oklahoma City. And I got a good standing ovation. In  fact they say I got the best. Anyway it was real interesting. Of course  I   d sang before big crowds before. That really don   t bother me any.  Did they choose the song, or did you choose it?  Um     They probably did, didn   t they?  I think they   d seen me when I had sung the old Oklahoma state song but  I   m not sure.  Yeah, they   d heard him sing it. They   d had a senior get together of the  hundred year olds earlier in the year, in the spring sometime. And he   d  sung it down there for them. So that   s what they wanted him to sing at  the Centennial, too. So they requested that.  26  Welch  Finchum  Welch  Wedge  Welch  Wedge  Welch  Finchum  Welch  Wedge  Welch  Finchum  Welch  Finchum  Welch  Finchum  Um     Did you have to go through makeup?  Yeah, I had   two of the girls from Hollywood or somewhere. I don   t  know...  We walked in there and there sat Shirley Jones.  Yeah. They were the ones who made me up, you know.  When I was in college, I thought Shirley Jones was the prettiest girl I   d  ever seen. I married the second prettiest, his daughter. That   s what I told  Shirley that night. But I think Melva is as pretty as she is now.  Well she ran for beauty queen down there  OSU  but there   s a little  politics involved in that.  You think?  You   ve got to know the right people.  Well, she was in the running for engineering queen. And the one that got  it was in the School of Engineering. So it   s a little bit hard to break  through that.  But she was a good student. Better than I was.  But you graduated and that   s all that counts, right?  Yeah. I graduated but I didn   t have that 3.5 or whatever it was, the  grade.  But times were different. You can   t really compare. Times were  different, then. You did well.  Yeah, I did real well, because I didn   t know. You know kids when they  go to school, they don   t know what they   ve got. You know, they say that  you can make anything out of yourself that you want to, and that   s really  true. But you have to take advantage of what they   ve got and if you miss  out, you don   t get a second chance, you see. When you go through there  once, why, that   s it. And it   s, well the education that you get, you know,  you really don   t appreciate it until it   s too late. I just figure that I could  have done a lot better in school if I   d known what I had there.  But it got you a job at the end of it.  27  Welch  Finchum  Welch  Finchum  Welch  Finchum  Welch  Yeah, got a job. Thought I was doing good to get a job. But, see, I got a  job in 1928. And I got a job teaching vocational agriculture at Merritt.  And I went to Carmen  Oklahoma  and bought a Model-A Ford, brand  new one,  550 cash. And I didn   t have a dime, but my dad signed the  note and they gave me the car. I had the car paid for in just a little bit  because I was getting what I thought was a fabulous salary. You see, I  had part of my   with vocational agriculture, why, half of your salary is  paid by the government. So a lot of time I   d make more money than the  superintendent would on salaries. And they were always jealous of that,  you know. They hated to give you your check because they were  supposed to be the highest paid in the school. But vocational agriculture,  I got that job in 1928 at Merritt. I stayed at Merritt, I think two or three  years and then I went to Cheyenne and stayed there and then is when I  started working with the Soil Conservation Service.  So that was about when the dust bowl was happening.  Yeah. I went through the dust bowl in the    30   s. Right when I got  through school and the Depression. And it was really tough then. Well  we had dust here sometimes. It would move in just like a storm cloud  coming in from the north, you   d see it coming. And when it got here, it  just turned black and the lights would go on, everything was   dust was  so thick, you know. But those   when they began to learn how to use  that land out in the panhandle, they stopped that. We don   t have that dust  anymore. We haven   t had it like we had it then. So things have  improved quite a bit as far as that   s concerned.  I   m sure your trees have helped.  Well    at least they thought they helped. And there were plenty of  places to plant them. We had big crews out planting trees. Of course I  think later on why I probably   you know trees, if they   re not put in the  right place, not put where they have good moisture and everything,  they   re only good for ten or twelve years and then they start dying. So  some of those shelter belts are completely gone now. And there are  others   there   s some right out here that have been here for a long, long  time. They   re still good. Cedar trees   cedars and elms, but mostly  cedars are the ones that can stand this dry country here.  Has this town stayed pretty much the same over the years or     No this town is like all towns and valleys. It   s kind of holding its own a  little bit. But it   s not the town that it used to be. You see, we used to  have a college here called the Connell State School of Agriculture. And  we had five grocery stores here. All of them had delivery wagons. We  had two car dealers, Ford, and Chevrolet and Buick. And a train came  28  Wedge  Welch  Wedge  Welch  Wedge  Welch  Finchum  Welch  Wedge  Finchum  Welch  Wedge  Welch  Finchum  Welch  Finchum  Welch  Finchum  Welch  Finchum  Welch  through every day, the Frisco Railroad. You could ride from here to  Enid.  The depot and a hotel.  Yeah the depot down here. It   s not there anymore. Well, Helena   s not     How many banks?  Two banks.  And how many theaters.  Well we had two. Two movie theaters, you know.  And are there any today?  No. No movie theaters here.  No. None of that stuff. One bank.  Grocery store?  One bank.  Quick Trip     And it belongs to Cherokee. That is, other banks bought these little  banks.  What was the driving economical force? Farming?  What   d you say?  What made the town grow then?  Well     Farming.  It was just one   the town used to be at Carlisle, Oklahoma. Now have  you ever heard of Carlisle?  Mm-hmm, heard of that.  You know where Carlisle was then?  29  Finchum  Welch  Finchum  Welch  Finchum  Welch  Wedge  Welch  Wedge  Finchum  Welch  Finchum  Welch  Finchum  I   ve heard of it, I haven   t been there.  Yeah well that   s where   that was the town. But when the railroad came  through, they missed Carlisle. And they came through here. So it wasn   t  very much of a move up here from   to get on the railroad from Carlisle  so that   s really what started the town.  Okay.  The   and it grew to a pretty nice town, a pretty nice town.  Has a grain elevator?  Yeah, we had, I think, three or four or five grain elevators. They were  individually owned. The farmers now own the elevators, it   s a  cooperative deal. They built these great big huge tanks that they put  wheat in. But the old elevators were individual granaries, you might say.  And they all had an engine in them where they could elevate the wheat  and the railroads could   that   s when the railroads hauled wheat. The  railroads don   t haul wheat out here anymore. It   s all truck now, great big  semi trucks. They pick up the wheat from this elevator here. They have,  oh I don   t know how many million bushels of wheat. But this is pretty  big wheat country right through here.  Didn   t they have a flour mill here at one time?  Yeah, they had a flour mill here. They had a flour mill and they even  shipped flour to Japan. But it didn   t last   it might have caught fire. I  don   t know what. But anyway     It was all farm related in those days. And the railroad was kind of the  key. When you travel this part of the country like Dad did, you know  where the railroads are or where they were. Every town had a railroad at  one time, otherwise it didn   t survive.  Probably ice plants too? An ice plant?  Yeah, we had an ice plant. We had ice plants here. And we had a livery  stable where people that drove through could put their horses up at night.  Just like a hotel.  Well, is there anything I haven   t asked that you want to be sure we get  on tape. Do you want to talk a little bit about your wife?  Well my first wife     Was she an OSU     30  Welch  Finchum  Welch  Wedge  Welch  Wedge  Welch  Wedge  Welch  Wedge  Finchum  Wedge  Welch  Finchum  Wedge  Welch  No. She got her   she was a school teacher and she got her degree from  Northwestern State University at Alva.  Okay.  She was a school teacher. She loved to teach school. And she was a  good school teacher, too.  When she first started   tell them when she first started down there south  of town.  Oh well she started     You didn   t have to have a degree then.  Yeah, you used to have 20 or 20-30 hours to start with or something like  that in education to qualify as a school teacher. You could teach in a  grade school. And that   s when she started out. But she kept going until  she got her degree in education at Alva at Northwestern Oklahoma State  University, is what they called it. Later on then, when I got through  working with the Conservation Service, we went to Wichita and we  taught up there for twenty-something years. She died in Billings,  Montana. She got sick. We went up there   did we go up there to see  you?  Yeah, we were living in Billings, Montana for a few years. And they  came up over Christmas.  Anyway, she was sick when she got up there but then she got sicker.  Then we had to put her in ICU and she just lasted 16 days. And 16 in  ICU.  She had cancer that had been undiagnosed.  You   d been married for 50, 60 years?  Almost 60.  I was married with her for 55 years, I think.  Almost 60.  Almost 60 because you were married in    28, weren   t you?  Yeah.  31  Wedge  Welch  Wedge  Finchum  Wedge  Finchum  Welch  Finchum  Welch  Finchum  Welch  Finchum  And she died in...     88.     88?  So around 60.  Yeah so it was right close to    60. Yeah we had a big celebration for their  50th. We have pictures from that.  And what was the secret to lasting that long? For 60 years of     For 60 years?  Yeah.  Well, I don   t know whether there is any secret or not. But you know  there are some things that you don   t know about when you   re kids and  one of them is cigarettes. Cigarettes will kill you.  Yes.  And so will beer and alcohol, any kind of alcohol. Alcohol is a poison. I  don   t see why they tolerate alcohol or cigarettes either because they   re  both deadly. And every guy and every gal that is a smoker, they   re  pulling oxygen cart around before long and they   re lungs turn black.  They say you buy a little time if you quit early, but that don   t keep it  from happening. Because you just buy a little time so you get to live a  little longer. So staying away from those things, and then good doctors.  I had a ruptured appendix at one time and the doctor in Enid told me     told my wife that if I hadn   t have had penicillin said,    We couldn   t have  saved you.    I was in the hospital for thirty days, they don   t keep you that  way   that long now, but they did then. I kept asking when I was going  to get out. And he said,    Whenever your wound stops draining.    The  day it stopped draining, why I was out. But that was thirty days. Today,  you   d be lucky if you got to stay in there two days, in a hospital. And  it   s a thousand dollars a day now I think. Something like that. It   s  unbelievable. And its   I got Blue Cross and Blue Shield. That   s my  health   and they   ve been real good. They   ve taken care of everything  I   ve ever gotten into. I don   t know if they   ll keep it up, but as long as I  don   t let my payments lapse, while they   ll   I guess they   ll keep on.  Let   s see     And that   s your letter.  32  Welch  Finchum  Welch  Finchum  Welch  Wedge  Welch  Wedge  Finchum  Welch  Finchum  Welch  Yeah.  Well do you have any advice for current college students?  For current college students?  Yeah.  Well, if they   re really going there to get an education, they ought to  really try. Because if they aren   t going there to get an education, why  there   s no use in going. It   s like   well you read all these things. You  read how deadly tobacco is, you read how deadly liquor is and all that.  And everybody knows that, and they read it, but they don   t believe it  I  guess, because they still do it. Why is it that people do those things  when they know it   s deadly? And every time you   just alcohol   every  time you drink a little alcohol as a mind bender and it destroys cells in  your body. And you   re worst off after a drink. And anybody who says  you can have liquor in the family, there   s something wrong with them  because they   re not well informed. Because that   s terribly. So that liquor  is   people think they can get by with that. But that   s just like Russian  Roulette.  They actually have made Oklahoma State a smokeless campus.  Yeah.  Is that working out okay?  Mm-hmm I think so.  And a beer-less campus. You can   t take any beer in the stadium either. I  hope they     They still can   t     Well, when I was there, why, I went out for wrestling and Ed Gallagher  was the coach. And I got to mingle and wrestle with the best in the  world because they never were beaten when I was down there at OSU.  We had one kid there from Perry, his name was Jack Van Bebber. And  he was the best wrestler I   ve ever seen. He wasn   t a very good student,  but he sure was deadly on the mat. He could throw any kid that I ever  saw. I remember George Rule. George Rule was a heavy weight. We  had a guy come in from the Chicago Athletic Club and I didn   t think  anybody could beat him because he had such a neck you couldn   t tell  where his shoulders started and his neck   it kind of set right on the end  of his shoulders. I didn   t think anybody could beat him, but one of our  33  Finchum  Welch  Finchum  Welch  Finchum  Nykolaiszyn  Finchum  Welch  Finchum  Welch  Finchum  Welch  wrestlers beat him pretty quick in a contest there. But OSU had the best  wrestling team in the world. Wasn   t anybody who could beat them. So I  had a lot of fun with those guys. They could have killed me, but they  didn   t.  You just made them better.  Well once in a while they   d say    Well, I have to get more resistance than  you.    But anyway, I had a lot of fun. I never was a wrestler. But Ed  Gallagher was a good coach. He had put his men in the worst situations  you could get in, and then he   d teach them how to get out of it. That   s  the way Ed Gallagher taught. He   d get the worst hold you could   the  worst situations you could be in, get a penny hold, and then the study  was how to break that. And that   s the reason why they were so good.  And they were never beaten as long as   until the guys that wrestled for  OSU or Oklahoma A M got out and were coaches at other places like  Iowa and some of those other big schools up north, Kansas. And then  they began to lose some matches because they had coaches come from  Oklahoma A M who knew just as much about it as they did so they  began to lose matches. But they   re still pretty good.  Yeah, they   re pretty good.  Yeah, they   re still pretty good.  Well do you want to finish by singing the     Alma Mater?  The Alma Mater?   Begins singing  OAMC, OAMC, we   ll sing your praise tonight. To let  you know where   er we go for the orange and black we   ll fight. We   ll  sing your praise throughout the Earth and shout ki yi, ki ye. In books of  fame, we   ll right your name, OAMC.  Singing ends  That   s what we  learned to sing.  Well thank you. It   s been a pleasure meeting you and hearing your story  today.  Well one of the songs that I sang that I got over someplace where I sang  is the Alcoholic Blues. Did you ever hear the Alcoholic Blues?  No. Will you do that one for us too?   Begins singing  I love my country,    deed I do. But all of these wars  34  Wedge  Finchum  Welch  Finchum  Welch  Finchum  Welch  Finchum  Welch  Wedge  Finchum  have made me so blue. I like fighting, that   s my name. But fighting is  the least about the fighting game. When Mr. Hoover said to cut my  dinner down. I didn   t even hesitate, I never frowned. I cut my sugar, I  cut my coal. But now they   ve cut deep in my soul. I   ve got the blues.  I   ve got the blues. I   ve got those alcoholic blues. No more beer my  heart to cheer. And no more whiskey, it used to make me frisky. So long  highball. So long gin. Tell me when you   re coming back again. Blues,  I   ve got the blues, since they amputated my booze. Lordy, lordy, war  is    well, now you know I don   t have to tell. Oh, I   ve got those  alcoholic blues. Some blues.  Ends singing  That   s just the first verse.  That   s from the prohibition days, as you can imagine.  That   s funny.  Did you ever hear of that song?  No.  Well that was prohibition you see. I lived when they had prohibition.  That   s when it was against the law to have liquor, you know.  We probably need to balance that with a church song. Do you have a  favorite church song?  Yeah. Um, let   s see, God   s Acre. Did you ever hear of God   s Acre?  Let   s start it, and I   ll see.   Begins singing  I   m driving backward to the farm. The harvest day is  done. And I   m passing by God   s acre at the setting of the sun. And I  slow the homing horses. For I must soliloquize. On that white crop  standing silent against the crimson skies. Well I guess there   s tares a  plenty. And I guess there   s lots of chaff. And I guess there   s maybe  stories that would make a fellow laugh. And I guess there   s maybe  stories that would make a fellow weep. And the angel   s kind of whisper  as around the stones they creep. Well the Lord he up and planted and the  harvest came to head. And he sure is most particular when all is done  and said. But I reckon when it   s sifted and the crop is in the bin. It will  be a durned hard sinner as the Lord ain   t gathered in.  Ends singing  I  pitched my song a little too high, so     That   s all the way from his college days, too.  That   s good.  35  Wedge  Welch  Wedge  Welch  Nykolaiszyn  Finchum  Welch  Finchum  Welch  Finchum  Welch  Finchum  Welch  You learned that in college, didn   t you?  Yeah.  And you know what God   s acre is? The cemetery.  God   s acre is the cemetery. Have you ever heard it before?  No.  I haven   t, no.  The song goes it will be a durned hard sinner the Lord   s ain   t gathered in  because the Bible says, you know, God says it   s not my will that any  man should perish, that all should come to repentance. And so the will  of the Lord is that everyone should live. So if you die without the Lord  why then you   re like a ship without guidance. And so without the Lord,  why, you   re on your own. But that, it   d be a durned hard sinner because  anybody who repents or accepts the Lord Jesus Christ as their savior and  believes God, then the Bible says that if you believe God it   s accounted  unto you as righteousness. So that   s where you get your righteousness, is  your belief in God. If you don   t believe in God then you don   t have any  righteousness. When you believe God it is accounted unto you as for  righteousness. Well that   s all anybody has to do. That   s the way the  Bible teaches you, know what, you accept in the Lord Jesus Christ as  your savior. And those who don   t they die--they don   t know where  they   re at. They don   t have no faith. Because we put our faith in the  Lord Jesus Christ that we will live again. Ever since man has been on the  Earth, I think everyone of them, every tribe or everyone in the world,  believes that man will live again after death. The bible teaches that. So  it   ll be a durned hard sinner as the Lord ain   t gathered in. If you   re a  believer, you know. If you   re a believer its accounted unto you for  righteousness. That   s the way you get your righteousness. He who  doesn   t believe is not a righteous person.  I think I   m finished.  You think you   re finished? (Laughter)  Unless you want to go on.  Well let   s see. I have another song I can do.  Can you do Give Me That Old Time Religion?  Well I   ve sang that song, but I really don   t know it very well.  36  Finchum  Welch  Finchum  Welch  Wedge  Welch  Finchum  Welch  Wedge  Finchum  Wedge  Welch  Wedge  Welch  Wedge  Finchum  Wedge  Welch  It   s one of my favorites.  Yeah  And I like I   ll Fly Away.  Yeah.  He familiar with them, but he doesn   t know all the     Yeah. Let   s see.  Are you going to play for us?  I don   t know if I   ll play it or not. But for a religious    let   s see the  songs in my old Baptist hymnal.  He grew up a Methodist but he married a Baptist, so he changed.  Well I   m the opposite. I grew up a Baptist and married a Methodist.  Oh, okay.  Yeah my folks were all Methodist.  Hang on, don   t sit down yet cause the stool   s not there.  Well I   m wasn   t, I   m going to get the book here. This is the Baptist  Hymnal and I   ll pick out one here   maybe I   ll find one there that I like.  His wives, first and second, being sisters, their grandfather was a circuit-riding  Baptist preacher here in the Cherokee Strip way before statehood.  And he helped form most of these small churches here in Helena and  Nash and Jet.  That   s neat.  He was an old German. They were   well his dad came over from  Germany and was a Baptist preacher in the late 1800   s. And they think  they were kind of run out of Germany from religious persecution. And  they ended up in Missouri and then down in Oklahoma. John Paul     John Paul Fredrick Werner was his name. His wife  Melvin   s  was a  Werner.  Now this song here is the reason why in the Christian world, Sunday is  the day of worship. But the Seventh Day Adventist and some like that  37  Finchum  Welch  Wedge  Finchum  Welch  Finchum  they take Saturday. But this tells you why, how we got the first Lord   s  day.   Begins singing  They rolled the stone before the door, as in the grave he  laid. God raised him up, our living Lord and made the first Lord   s day.  We sing for joy. We sing for joy with loving thanks we say: God raised  him up, our living Lord and made the first Lord   s day. The birds that  sing, the flowers that bloom, they brought no joy that spring.    Til Christ  was raised from death to be our living Lord and king. We sing for joy,  we sing for joy with loving hearts we sing. God raised him up, our living  Lord and made the first Lord   s day. All Earth is dressed in green this day  to greet our risen Lord. We praise him for he lives again. He keeps his  promised word. We sing for joy, we sing for joy with loving thanks we  say: God raised him up, our living Lord and made the first Lord   s day.   Ends singing   Very good.  And that   s how we got the first Lord   s Day.  That   s one of his favorites.  That   s very good. Well, thank you.  See, I worked with Soil Conservation Services and we traveled all over  Texas. I led the singing in a lot of these Baptist churches and, you  know, I used to sing in the Baptist church and the Methodist church at  Stillwater and that was pretty hard, too. You had to be pretty good or  they wouldn   t let you sing. But at Stillwater they wouldn   t hire a  preacher if they didn   t have a doctor   s degree. That is, all the preachers  when I was down there, every one of them had a doctor   s degree in  theology. Baptist preacher, the Methodist preacher, even   And I had a  piano teacher down there; she was a graduate of Cambridge University.  And we got along real good. She gave me A   s in piano. And she said  one day, she said,    Well, you   ve got to go to my church one semester.     She said,    We   ve got a part in there.    They called it the Te Deum  Laudamus. It   s a choir song but there   s a high tenor part and there   s no  one who can sing it in our church. She said,    You come down there. I   ve  heard you sing, I know you can sing it.    So I went to the Episcopal  Church one semester and I sang that song every morning, every Sunday  morning in the choir at the Episcopal Church in Stillwater. The  preacher   s name, they called him the Most Reverend Scholly Hawk.  That was his title: the Most Reverend Scholly Hawk.  And was that part of your grade?  38  Welch  Finchum  Welch  Wedge  Welch  Wedge  Welch  Finchum  Welch  Finchum  Welch  Finchum  Well, probably was (Laughter), anyway she told me to come over there,  so I did. It   s quite a formal church, you know. Have you ever been to an  Episcopal church?  No, I haven   t.  Well they all dress   they have quite a rigamaro of things they do. What  do you call it? Anyways     They have a lot of ritual.  Ritual. Yeah, ritual. That   s what I was trying to say. Well we   d all put  our choir robes in the loft way up above the sanctuary. And then the  piano or the organ would start playing and we would march down the  center aisle and take our place up in the choir. And then that song was  always sung, the Te Deum Laudamus. I can   t sing it anymore, if I had  the book then I could. But they sing different, they   re chants. They don   t  sing like we did in the Baptist church or the Methodist church. But they  have what they call chant books. And there   s just a little difference.  They go on   you could sing the first three or four measures on the same  key or same notes, you know. And then it shifts. It   s pretty. It   s really  nice when you get used to it. But it   s hard for me to get used to it. But I  went to church there one semester because she wanted me to go there  because I could sing the Te Deum Laudamus. I don   t what that means.  It means something in Latin, and I haven   t had Latin.  I did, but I forgot what it meant.  Praise to God   Yeah. Well I belonged to the Methodist church and I belonged to the  Baptist church. So I   ve been sprinkled and I   ve been baptized.  Well, you   re covered then. (Laughter) Well, we   re going to turn this  machine off, so thank you very much for having us today.  All right.  It was quite a pleasure.  I should have been organized a little better I guess.  No you were great.  -------  -------
