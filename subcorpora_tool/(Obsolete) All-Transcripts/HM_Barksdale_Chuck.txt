Speaker 2: In the City of Chicago, Illinois, the County of Cook.
Story_ID: 2926
Speaker 1: I want you to tell me what your favorite food is.
Speaker 2: My favorite food is fish, a nice salad, tossed salad, potatoes, which is pretty obvious (laughs), and I'm not really a bread eater per se, but I do like wheat rolls or wheat bread.  I don't really like white bread.  I'm not being prejudiced.  I just don't like white bread.  It's not nutritious enough for me.
Speaker 1: What's your favorite time of year?
Speaker 2: Favorite time of year?  Summertime.
Speaker 1: Color?
Speaker 2: Between purple and blue.
Speaker 1: If you were to go on vacation, where would you like to go?
Speaker 2: You know a couple of years ago, I went to Aruba for one of my nieces' weddings, and I really loved Aruba, Herb [Kent, interviewer].  I'd been to all the islands previous--Jamaica, Nassau, Bermuda, etc.--and there's something about Aruba that just really just kind of got the kid right here, you know?
Speaker 1: I'd like to know your parents names--.
Speaker 2: Phrases--.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay. Your favorite phrase, you know, favorite slang expression.
Speaker 2: "Oh, man!"  That's my favorite.
Speaker 1: Any others?
Speaker 2: "Can you believe this?"
Story_ID: 2927
Speaker 1: Now name your mother and father.
Speaker 2: My mother's name was Sarah Bernice Barksdale.  Well, Keaton was her given, her maiden name.  My father's name was Sumner Odell Barksdale.  Kind of strange that his name would be Odell, spelled O-D-E-L-L, and we ended up being called The Dells.  I mean, it's kind of like everything prewritten.  That shows you how great God is.
Story_ID: 2928
Speaker 1: Name your siblings in order, birth order.
Speaker 2: My daughter is my oldest sibling, and she's twenty-six.  She'll be twenty-seven on the twelfth of August of this year, 2000.  My son--oh, I'm sorry, my daughter's name is Rashonda Therese Barksdale.  My son, whose name is Charles Junior, Charles Sumner Barksdale, Junior--he was born September seventh, 1977.  He's twenty-two and will be twenty-three this coming September seventh.
Story_ID: 2929
Speaker 1: As a young child being born in the City of Chicago [Illinois] back during the [Great] Depression days, it was very enlightening to know that I had both parents, father [Sumner Odell Barksdale] and mother [Sarah Bernice Barksdale].  Times were hard, but times were real and to have the support of a father and mother were very important in terms of balance.  I had no idea that I was going to end up being into this field of entertainment.  I call this business "show" because if you don't have your business together, the show is not going to happen.
Story_ID: 2930
Speaker 1: My mother's [Sarah Bernice Barksdale] mentor from a vocal standpoint was Marian Anderson [opera singer].  My mother had a very wonderful contralto voice.  I think that a lot of my musical training and my musical abilities came from my mother's side in terms of show business.  She never got a chance to get into the real realm of show business because it just wasn't meant to be, Herb [Kent, interviewer], okay?  It was just one of those situations where she had two children.  My sister--her name is Theresa, Abbott now, Barksdale at that time, and she had myself, and we were not her stumbling blocks, but she was not pushed by her mother and father who were from the old school, old school, old school from Missouri, and they did not believe in that.  It was like "church this, church that," so forth and so on, so my mother could sing it all, so to speak.  She could sing the so-called secular music which is along the lines of what Marian Anderson would sing, the operatic type songs, and she could also sing the church songs, and my sister played piano extremely well, and she used to accompany my mom.  That was fantastic.
Story_ID: 2931
Speaker 1: What did your mother do for a living?
Speaker 2: My mother [Sarah Bernice Barksdale] did what most black women did at that time.  She did a lot of housework.  She ironed the white folks' clothes and shirts and pants and whatever, and she did what she could do, menial jobs and whatever to try to support, help support the family.
Speaker 1: Is there anything else you would like to say?
Speaker 2: She's missed very much.
Speaker 1: (Inaudible off-camera voice)
Speaker 2: You said she was from Missouri.  Can you talk about her family, what you know about her family?
Speaker 1: My mother's background is pretty extensive.  I cannot go too much into it because as a young child, I don't recall too much.  I do know that my mother was, I believe, born in DeSoto, Missouri, which is right outside of St. Louis, Missouri, and they had a place down there called Valles Mines [Missouri, mining village].  There's a place down there--Valles Mines, which is really something else, was owned by some French people from what I was told, and they actually had a mine down there so they called it Valles Mines, and a lot of the black men down there worked in the mines.  They were never to receive their financial just due, so to speak.  They just worked there and--you know, almost mine sharecroppers, so to speak, you know, but they did their thing, and they raised their families, and out of those families came my grandmother and my grandfather.  My grandfather came from a family called Keaton, K-E-A-T-O-N, and my mother's mother came from a side called Townsend, and therein lies a lot of mixed balls and bags and things and whatever there between. A--Robert Townsend [director, actor]--we've been questioning each other as to whether we're kin or we don't know because we came from slave plantations, and we just don't know whether we are kin or not.  It's possible.
Story_ID: 2932
Speaker 1: Your father [Sumner Odell Barksdale].  I notice you talk a lot about your mother [Sarah Bernice Barksdale].  Tell us about your father.
Speaker 2: Dad was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.  Dad was a street hustler.  Dad was a policeman for five minutes.  He was a bellhop.  He was a womanizer.  (Laughs) He--I think a lot of those things wore off on me, and I just tried my best not to get too involved as years progressed, but Dad was, Dad was pretty cool.  I think that alcohol and a sundry of other things just kind of took him out of here when time was--time for him to go.  I think the Lord just said "hey, look, you've done enough so you've got to go."
Speaker 1: What did he do for you in your life?
Speaker 2: I think that what he did was to put some steadfastness into me in terms of where I needed to go.  Show business was not my great forte of where I really thought I was going until, I think, my late teens, and it was like that show business bug that bit me because, see, Dad was also in show business.  He was a--he was an actor of sorts.  I remember back in--it had to be in the late, late '30s [1930s], maybe early '40s [1940s], when Dad was working as a bit part--you know, a bit part guy, doing something, and he was a shoeshine guy, in fact.  I'll never forget this.  He took me down to the State and Lake Theater [Chicago, Illinois], and I'm sitting in the audience.  I had a nice little seat, sitting down there and saying "boy, my dad is getting ready to come on stage," and here comes this man out there with this shoeshine box, and he said "boy, you want me to shine your shoes?" And I said "Lord, have mercy.  Let me out of here."  I mean, as a young kid, this destroyed me, but I understood.  I understand now.  It's just like Stepin Fetchit [actor] and any of the rest of them, the parts that they did.  Unfortunately, it's like they say, "slavery was necessary."  Maybe this was necessary to bring us around to a point to where we begin to understand who we are, what we are, and where we do go from here.
Story_ID: 2933
Speaker 1: You don't know anything about your father's parents on that side of your family?
Speaker 2: There were many, many stories.  My grandfather, my father's father, passed when I must have been about one or two years old. But I remember one story that was--they were from--they were living in Akron, Ohio at the time, and they had this outdoor amusement park, similar to what used to be in Chicago [Illinois] when we had the Riverview [amusement park].  Well, this is similar to that, and they had the high rides, you know, the roller coasters, and it seemed as though my grandfather was carrying my father [Sumner Odell Barksdale] and one of my uncles who has passed since then.  His [Barksdale's grandfather's] name was Bernard [Barksdale].  My father's name was Sumner.  They used to call him [Bernard Barksdale] "Ebony."  He was so black that they called him Ebony.  That was his nickname.  He was carrying both of the boys in his arms, and they fell out of the roller coaster.  Well, my grandfather was such a strong-willed man and very stubborn, very strong-bodied and the whole bit.  They say they fell out--he was on the ground, and the people were running over there to him and saying well, you know, "sir, are you okay?"  And he said "get away from me.  Let me get up from here and take my boys and go home."  My grandmother, my grandmother, his wife, said "wait a minute. You mean to tell me you didn't tell them white people that we need to get some money for you falling out of that roller coaster?"  He said "I don't want no money from them white folks. Let me go home. Just leave me alone." I said "there went the first fortune of the Barksdale family that we'll never, never retrieve" (laughs).
Story_ID: 2934
Speaker 1: Do you have any other stories about your parents?
Speaker 2: There are a lot of stories.  There are so many stories that I'm trying to think what comes to mind that might be of interest to The HistoryMakers type thing.  There are so many, there are so many stories in the black community that very seldom get uncovered because there's nobody there to cover them, and I'm so appreciative of the fact that I get a chance to speak on this.
Speaker 1: How about some black and white stories?
Speaker 2: There was a movie about The Dells [Barksdale's R&B group], really, that ended up being called 'The Five Heartbeats.' Speaking of prejudices, speaking of incidents that happened, that realistically happened.  There's a scene in the 'The Five Heartbeats' where the Georgia state troopers actually stopped our station wagon on the highway, and they were looking for drugs or alcohol or anything stupid for their so-called reasoning for stopping us, totally unjustified. But they couldn't find anything, so they said "well, here we are.  You all them Dells, them Dells singing boys?"  "Yeah, yeah, yeah."  "Well, get out of the car and sing for us."  We were mad, boy.  All of Chicago [Illinois] was about to come out of us, but we were about to go to the penitentiary or on one of them lynching trees, one of the two. But anyway we got out, and very reluctantly, as you saw in 'The Five Heartbeats,' we started singing, and you know, some people sing for their supper.  We sang to get back in the car so we can go and continue on our journey to the next gig.  They let us go, but it was the point of humiliation and the point that they had the so-called powers at that point.  As unjustified as it was, they did it, and I'm here to tell the story.
Story_ID: 2935
Speaker 1: Chuck, what did you dream about as a child?  What kind of aspirations? What did you want to be?
Speaker 2: I didn't know what I wanted to be.  I think like most kids--not all kids, quite honestly, but most kids--there's many, many stories that you--or many, many dreams that you come up with in your head.  I wanted to be a baseball player.  I wanted to be a basketball player.  Never wanted to be a football player.  I always loved baseball and basketball.  I had a cousin that ended up being in the NBA [National Basketball Association].  His name was Don Barksdale.  He played for the Boston Celtics [basketball team] years ago.  I wanted to be a basketball player.  I wanted to be--I wanted to be everything except what I ended up being, in probably one of the greatest vocal groups in the world, the Dells [Barksdale's R&B group].  I'm very proud of this, but, as I said, in the scheme of things as I was coming along as a child, as far as I knew, God hadn't planted that into my brain for me to understand where I was going and where I was going to end up being with a group for some forty-eight years.
Story_ID: 2936
Speaker 1: What happened for me as a child, my mother's [Sarah Bernice Barksdale] parents lived in Harvey [Illinois].  My father's [Sumner Odell Barksdale] parents or my grandmother, my father's mother, lived in Chicago [Illinois] so what happened was I went to school in Harvey [at Thornton Township High School].  Excuse me.  I went to school in Harvey, and I spent my summers in Chicago with my grandmother, my father's mother, and we spent--it was a good balancing time for me.  I got some suburban training as well as some Chicago rearing, and all these things here kind of helped to stabilize me to a degree because I was a little, I was a little rascal.  I mean, you know, we were not into the gang things like these young brothers are today because we did have some support there.  We had somebody that was telling you right from wrong, and you could get a whipping two or three times before you got home from the various neighbors, which some of these kids need today.  I spent this time, like I said, bouncing back and forth between Harvey, Illinois, Chicago, Illinois.
Story_ID: 2937
Speaker 1: But for the most part, the part as far as the Dells [Barksdale's R&B group] were concerned, we got together.  I must have been nineteen years old at this time.  I had just come out of the service.  I had been in the [U.S.] Air Force and had come home and didn't have the slightest idea what I was going to do next.  It's like the light bulb that goes off in the head.  The light bulb went off--bingo.  Here I go talking about it.  I meet this guy named Michael McGill [singer] who happened to be still going to high school, and how we met--excuse me, can we go back again?  But how we met, how Mickey, Michael McGill and I met is something I cannot really remember, exactly when and how we met, but the point is, is that his mother, God rest her soul, was a devout Jehovah's Witness, and she would not allow Mickey to have secular music in the home. But they had a woodshed, and if you knew anything about show business, you know that when you go into the woodshed, you go in there to practice.  Unbeknownst to us, that's just what we were doing.  Mickey had a record player in the woodshed, and he said "well, listen, you like vocal groups?"  I said "yeah."  We went into his woodshed, and he had all these records by the Ravens [R&B group], by the Clovers [R&B group], by the Five Keys [R&B group], by the Moonglows [R&B group], and whatever, and we would sit down and listen to these records and said "man, we got to get us a vocal group, man."  I said, "Hey, you know anybody that can sing?"  He says "I know a couple of guys, but I don't know if they can sing with us. See if they--just try them out.  We got one guy named Marvin Junior, another guy named Verne, but he's a basketball player, and he's playing for the Thornton [Township High School, Harvey, Illinois] basketball team, and I don't know if he wants to sing or not," and so forth and so on.  The next thing we know, we got a vocal group--couldn't sing a lick.  When we met this disc jockey in Harvey, Illinois, we went over to the radio station [WBEE, Harvey, Illinois radio station] and asked him if he would play our record for us.
Speaker 2: You can name the disc jockey.
Speaker 1: And the disc jockey at that particular time happened to be Herbert Rogers Kent [Herb Kent, disc jockey, interviewer].  The year was 1903. No, no, no, no, (laughter) no, no.  The year was 1953, and Herb gave us a lot of love.  He gave us a lot of inspiration.  At the same time he had lost his dog.  He had a collie that had gotten away from him.  I don't what his dog was.  Anyway, we found the dog out in the field, and we brought the dog to Herb, and I think from that point on Herb and the Dells became very, very close.  Moving on to what happened with the Dells, I think that the history speaks for itself.
Story_ID: 2938
Speaker 1: I'd like to know what kind of student you were when you were in high school [Thornton Township High School, Harvey, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Student?  Horrible.  I thought I was in the wrong place.  I didn't have the stabilization that a child needs in order to really cultivate his intellectual side or whatever.  I was hard to teach, hard to reach at that point in time. Wish many a day that I had really settled down, buckled down.  I probably would have been, become a--but see, here's the difference.  When God writes a script, we may not know what that script is, but some kind of way, if you live and He keeps you alive long enough, you'll follow that script, and you'll end up doing what He wants you to do, and as long as you try to do what's right, He'll guide you in the right path. And this is the path that He chose for me as an individual, and this also must be the path that He chose for the other four brothers in the Dells [Barksdale's R&B group].
Story_ID: 2939
Speaker 1: I think my favorite teacher as far as learning ended up being in the show business vernacular.  I ended up--Harvey Fuqua [singer] was a lead singer with the Moonglows [R&B group] who taught the Dells [Barksdale's R&B group] how to sing harmony.  Quincy Jones [composer, record producer] helped the Dells learn how to sing harmony.  Dinah Washington [singer] helped the Dells how to, learn how to sing harmony.  A brother named Kirk Stewart [vocal coach] taught the Dells how to sing jazz harmonies.  Thad Jones, a trombonist, helped the Dells.  We had an asundry [sic] of teachers that were not in a school school but in a music school, the world of music.  The world of music, we had some of the best teachers ever.
Story_ID: 2940
Speaker 1: My younger years as a young kid coming up through grammar school, high school, whatever, whatever--I think I was just unsettled as to just what I wanted to do.  I wasn't going to be the baseball player I thought I was going to be.  I wasn't going to be the basketball player.  I may have been aspiring to do a lot of different things, but the thing that really came into reality hit me when I was like nineteen years old, and it's like "let's start this singing group.  Here the group is.  It's called the Dells [Barksdale's R&B group]."  At first we were called the El Rays, which in Spanish means el is "the" and ray is "kings," and a lady by the name of Vivian Carter who owned Vee-Jay Records, she and her husband, Vivian Carter [record producer] and Jimmy Bracken [record producer].  The V and the J made up the Vee-Jay Records.  She did not like the name El Rays so she asked us to change the name.  Well, how do you change a name?  Just throw some hats, names in a hat and pull one out.  It just so happened that Verne, our second tenor, happened to throw in--Verne Allison [singer] threw in the name the Dells.  It had nothing to do with no music, just the Dells.
Speaker 2: Where did that come from?
Speaker 1: I believe it came from the fact that Verne--really, he may not admit this, but I think it came from him thinking about the Wisconsin--excuse me--from the Wisconsin Dells [vacation and resort area]. What's that got to do with anything with music?  Nothing, but it sounds good, and it fits real well on the marquee.  We were told years ago "keep your name short, and you can get your name on the marquee."  That was very important because, you know, a lot of times you usually see shows that say "James Brown [singer] and  Aretha Franklin [singer] and Others."  We didn't want to be "and Others."  Our name was the Dells, but your name was short enough--it only had five letters--if they just put "Dells" up there, at least they saw the name.
Story_ID: 2941
Speaker 1: There had to be some incident or something--a turning point in your life that made a transition from your school teachers to your music teachers where you wanted to be a singer.  Did anything--incident happen to make you make that decision?
Speaker 2: In terms of--.
Speaker 1: Did you say "well, I'm not going to be a basketball player.  I'm not going to be this.  I'm going to be a singer."
Speaker 2: I think what happened is there are certain things that happen in life that we just cannot put our finger on it and say "well, this is the reason why thus and so happened, and this and that, and so forth and so on."  Things happen.  You know, in this business they say, they say "shit happens, man," and it happens.  We don't even know why it happens.  The thing of it is is that if it's positive, you want to keep working on that, keep building on that.  That's what happened as far as the Dells [Barksdale's R&B group] were concerned.  We came from obscurity.  We were just an idea.  We were just something to do.  We ended up calling ourselves the El Rays.  We changed our name.  We ended up calling ourselves the Dells, and from that point 'til this millennium now, 2000, we're still the Dells, forty-eight years later, unbelievable.  Most people cannot stay together as husband and wife for five minutes, five years, or whatever.  Here we are, a marriage of black men--which is really remarkable. That we are all family men, we're all grandfathers, and we all still love and talk to each other, and we have respect and admiration for one another, and we got a new album out.
Story_ID: 2942
Speaker 1: Let's go back to Vee-Jay [record company].  Everybody can't get a record contract.  What led you there?
Speaker 2: At that time, 1953, we're looking at a time period when black vocal groups in the Chicagoland [Illinois] area were many.  I mean, there were hundreds of vocal groups.  We were the little kids that came from out of Harvey, Illinois.  As they say, we were, we had the least chance of any to survive and make it, to get a hit record.  We had cut a record over on Chess Records for Leonard Chess [record producer], and Leonard Chess had told us that we couldn't make it.  He told Marvin Junior [singer] that he couldn't sing.  He told Marvin--in fact, he asked Marvin, "Marvin, you have a job?" And Marvin said "yeah, I got a job.  I work for the steel mill," and he [Chess] said "keep your job, okay?  You'll never be a singer."  Oh, what an understatement.  Anyway, Chess Records [record company] was on the west side of 48th and Cottage Grove at that time in Chicago [Illinois].  Vee-Jay Records was exactly across the street on 48th and Cottage Grove.  We just literally walked across the street to Vee-Jay and said "hey, we just got kicked out of Chess.  Can we get something over here?"  So we did an audition, and [record producer] Vivian [Carter] liked our sound, just didn't like the name.  That's when we changed the name from the El Rays to the Dells.  That's how we got to Vee-Jay.
Story_ID: 2943
Speaker 1: Chuck, what did your mother [Sarah Bernice Barksdale] do to inspire you to become the guy you are today?
Speaker 2: I think that my mother's role with me was very supportive in terms of me being able to go into the field that she was never fortunate enough to be able to get into because of her family ties or whatever.  She never, she never let me down for one second as far as being in a vocal group, as far as being in the entertainment field period. She was my backbone. She loved--she loved the Dells [Barksdale's R&B group]--I mean, unbelievably she loved the Dells.  If she wasn't the Dells' number one fan, she was in the top one and a half, okay.  I'd say she was number one.  She was my number one anyway.
Story_ID: 2944
Speaker 1: As far as the Dells [Barksdale's R&B group] are concerned, what inspired them as a group?
Speaker 2: As we, as we got together as a vocal group of sorts in our earlier days, not really knowing how to sing--but working on it--a show came in town that had--that Nat King Cole [singer] was headlining, and on the show on that bill was a group called the Five Keys [R&B group].  This was the greatest experience in the Dells' lives, believe me.  We went down to the Chicago Theatre [Chicago, Illinois] to see the show, and on the stage comes this impeccably dressed black vocal group called the Five Keys.  They had a lead singer named Rudy [West, singer] and another lead singer named Marion [sic, Maryland Pierce, singer], and they'd interchange.  Marion [sic, Maryland] would sing the up tempo songs, and Rudy would sing the ballads, and we sat there with our mouths gapped open like gates.  We looked with admiration, with love, and respect, and that's what really inspired the Dells to move into this business of show.
Story_ID: 2945
Speaker 1: I'm gonna ask you to do something.  When we think of the Dells [Barksdale's R&B group], we think of the song, 'Stay In My Corner.'  Would you do that little monologue for us, please?
Speaker 2: No, you're thinking about 'Oh, What A Night.'
Speaker 1: 'Oh, What A Night?'  Oh, yes.  I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: "Do you, do you recall the night, that very special night?  Do you remember a girl, that very special girl?  Well, to the old and to the new, we rededicate this song to you."  Music.  Marvin Junior.  "Oh, what a night--."
Speaker 1: How did that come about? That is so famous. How did that come about?
Speaker 2: You know what happened, Herb [Kent, interviewer]?  Oh, here we go.  What happened is in 1956 our record of 'Oh, What A Night' was so huge.  It was much larger than we really even knew.  It was number three in the country.  Number one was 'Don't Be Cruel' by Elvis Presley [singer], and number two was Fats Domino's [singer] 'Blueberry Hill.'  Then here come the Dells.  We didn't know nothing about the charts.  We didn't know nothing about sales.  We didn't know anything except the fact that this record was so big in New York [New York].  When we first got to New York, it was like playing in the department stores, in the juke joints.  People were walking down the street singing it.  It was huge.  Well, move on to 1968.  Leonard Chess [record producer] came to us, the owner and president of Chess Records, and said "we gotta to do a remake of 'Oh, What A Night.'"  "Oh, a remake, are you mad?  Man, the record sold two or three million."  He said "we're doing a remake." So Bobby Miller, who was our producer at that time, decided that if we were going do a remake, we needed to have a monologue to reintroduce the song to people and to the new people--introduce it to them so he wrote the monologue.  I did the monologue.  Charles Stepney, God rest his soul, did the musical arrangements and the whole nine yards, and boy, what a smash, again.
Story_ID: 2946
Speaker 1: I'd like to go back a bit.  By answering this question if you could tell us, what the record business was like and how shoddy it could be.  Tell us about Vee-Jay Records. What were they about?
Speaker 2: Vee-Jay Records, undoubtedly being before Motown [record company], probably if they had gotten their business together, if they had really been about the management of the business, they would have probably been your Motown, but it wasn't written that way.  Mismanagement of many, many things, especially money--excuse me--they disrespected the artists so badly that eventually it became the demise of the company, and the Internal Revenue [Service] literally closed the company down because of mismanagement, not paying taxes, and things of this sort--and they definitely didn't pay the artist so that was bad news.
Speaker 1: Did they cheat artists?
Speaker 2: That's a nice way of putting it.  Cheating artists?  Oh, they cheated artists, very much so, and we [the Dells, R&B group] were one of the ones that got cheated.
Story_ID: 2947
Speaker 1: 'Oh, What A Night'--bookmark record. The original one, how did that get started?
Speaker 2: 1955, late, at one point we [the Dells, Barksdale's R&B group] were in the midst of rehearsing.  There were some young ladies that used to come by our rehearsals. And you know, when young ladies come around young men, you always have to show off a little bit, so forth and so on. But so the young ladies decided--one of them had gotten permission from their mother to invite the Dells over to their home for a dinner.  Well, we went over, and we hung out with them that night, that evening. And the next day at rehearsal, we were talking and Marvin [Junior, singer] said to Johnny Funches [singer], who was one of the original writers and also one of the original Dells.  He asked him, he said, he was just talking.  He said "man, did we have a good time last night?"  He said "oh, man, what a beautiful night," so and so and so and so.  He said "man, oh, what a night."  I said "hold it.  There's a song in there somewhere."  Well, I was like over there doing something, doodling on the piano, whatever, but the point is that Marvin and Johnny started writing 'Oh, What A Night.' And it happened because of a night prior to this, and I think it was just, it was just, you know how something is just supposed to happen?  I just believe this with all my heart and soul.  'Oh, What A Night' has been like a term for the Dells.  We can cut 'Stay in My Corner,' 'Give Your Baby a Standing Ovation,' 'A Heart Is a House For Love,' we could do all of them.  The keynote, the song that everybody waits for is 'Oh, What A Night.'
Speaker 1: How many copies have you sold?
Speaker 2: That's a very good question.  The first time out, 'Oh, What a Night' sold over two million, close to three.  Second time out, we're still counting because they still keep putting out the reissues and the catalogs, and it's on the internet.  It's on everything, and it's just selling, selling, selling it, and Marvin Junior keeps getting them checks (laughs).

Speaker 1: What role did Vee-Jay Records [record company] play in the development of the Dells [Barksdale's R&B group]?
Speaker 2: Not much, not--do you know in the beginning we were--in terms of speaking of a totem pole, we were at the very bottom of the totem pole because we were the little guys from out in Harvey, Illinois, and we were just on the label because Vivian [Carter, record producer] kind of liked us but wasn't nobody spending no money on the Dells.  "Hey, we could sing.  Why don't they like us?"  They wanted to send a tour out, and the tour was the first tour that Vee-Jay ever sent out, and we worked down at the ballroom on 61st there, the Trianon Ballroom [Chicago, Illinois], and we were on the show, and then we got up there and sang our little song and whatever, man, and the bus pulled up, and everybody loaded up on the bus, they left us standing at the curb.  I said "oh, man, this is the end of the world.  This is terrible.  They're going on a tour."  Well, the tour ended up being a disaster, but the point was that, was that we weren't on there, and we felt as though we had been betrayed and let down the whole nine yards, and it wasn't until about two years later that 'Oh, What A Night' burst through.  It ended up being a super, super, super smash and the beginnings of stardom for the Dells.
Speaker 1: Give me a good example of mismanagement at Vee-Jay.  Didn't somebody gamble somebody's wages?
Speaker 2: There was a young man--they named him the president of Vee-Jay Records--by the name of Ewart Abner who had terrible habits--drinking, gambling--and he literally more or less gambled Vee-Jay right on into bankruptcy.  I don't--I cannot say that he stole money.  I do know that he gambled a lot of the monies away in Las Vegas [Nevada]. And if anybody knows anything about what happened down here on Michigan Avenue from 22nd Street to 12th Street [Chicago] which was called Record Row at that point in time, they used to have gambling sessions every Friday at Elena's Record Place in the back, up at Vee-Jay, all over.  They would gamble every Friday, and the money would just go around and around and around in circles.  One guy would win this week, the next guy would win the next week, and so forth and so on, and I never got into none of them games.  I just watched them play, and I said "now this is ridiculous.  Everybody's taking this money, and nobody is taking this money and investing it in anything in terms of stabilizing this area here 'cause this area here is history."  This is history, man.  A lot of blood, sweat, and tears, and artists won and lost up and down Michigan Avenue from 22nd Street to 12th Street.  There used to be all kind of record companies, distributorships, and everything, and now the only thing we have over here that brings about history is HistoryMakers.
Story_ID: 2949
Speaker 1: There are similar starts of Vee-Jay [Records, record company] and black record companies.  Why did Motown [Records, record company] succeed and Vee-Jay fail?
Speaker 2: I have a story that I put together.  Some of it's true.  Some of it is false, but it's not a lie in terms of anything intentional to hurt or destroy, but it's a fact, to a degree.  Jimmy Bracken [record producer], who was the husband of Vivian Bracken [sic, Carter, record producer], owner of Vee-Jay Records, saw the demise of his company.  He saw it going down the tubes.  There was a record out around that time.  It was called 'Put a Message In the Bottle, Baby.'  He sit down and wrote a letter to Berry Gordy [record producer], put the message in the bottle, and it floated across Lake Michigan, and Berry was over there fishing for an idea, for some help or whatever, and he fished this bottle up out of the water.  It was almost like the genie popped out of there.  He opened it up and pulled the letter.  "Oh, man, what is this?"  It said "don't make the same mistakes I did, and here are the reasons, and these are some of the ways not to blah, blah, blah."  That was the beginning and the birth of the Motown Records.  I think that was so beautiful.  It came up in my mind.  It did not happen, per se.  I don't even know if Jimmy and Berry ever met each other, but it just seemed like it was apropos.  It just seemed like it was something that if it didn't happen, it should've happened.  It could've happened, and from a positive standpoint we know and everybody should understand that in order to have a successful business, it must be managed properly.  It all begins from the top, and it filters down.  It can't go from the bottom up.
Speaker 1: Berry probably did study Vee-Jay.
Speaker 2: I'm sure he did.  He probably studied Vee-Jay Records.  It was something to study.  It was an all black company.  They were the first company to bring on the Four Seasons [vocal group].  They were the first company to bring on the Beatles [rock band].  They had another group, another guy from over in England.  His name was Frank Ifield [singer].  "Who in the hell is Frank Ifield?"  I said "who in the hell are the Beatles?"  And they came up with all the blues.  They were the inventors.  They were the creators of all the blues labels in the world.  They had everybody from Jimmy Reed [singer, guitarist] to Muddy Waters [singer, guitarist].  I mean, they had them all.  Eventually what happened is with the mismanagement of the company, many, many, many things just kind of fell by the wayside because self-greed, lies, deceit, nonpayin' of the royalties to the various artists end up helping to become the very--the demise of Vee-Jay Records.
Story_ID: 2950
Speaker 1: Speaking of demise, I want to know about the rise of the Dells [Barksdale's R&B group] and the fall of the Dells. 'Cause you all took a big hit. Tell us about the rise and how great it was.
Speaker 2: Well, in 1958, we were on our way to New York City [New York] to the Apollo Theater [New York, New York], if I'm not mistaken, and the station wagon we were traveling in went completely out of control.  The A-frame, in fact, snapped.  It had previously been in an accident, and instead of the company that fixed it saying "hey, listen, the A-frame snapped.  This is not repairable.  You might as well get them a new one," whatever.  They just welded whatever back together, and it snapped.  Long story short, I went through the windshield.  Michael McGill [singer] ended up breaking his femur bone in his thigh.  He was in the hospital in Berea, Ohio, for some six months in traction.  He was on crutches for another six months.  I was very fortunate--excuse me--they always said I was a very hard-headed brother.  I went through the windshield.  I came out of there with very minor bruises and whatever, and we went on to finish up the engagements.  Mickey went in the hospital, of course.  When we came back off the road, we decided we better just kind of go chill out, chill out. And we did for almost two years just trying to repair our minds and our bodies and whatever, 'cause it was devastating.  Today, and I believe this to this day--the struggle is always before the ease.  We've been very blessed, very fortunate, and God has kept us strong, strong-willed and together.
Story_ID: 2951
Speaker 1: There was another major change though, where you changed lead singers which turned out to be a very wonderful thing.
Speaker 2: I think that's what happens when God puts things together.  It's like the young brother or the sister or whatever that has an affliction of sorts, that they're blind or whatever.  You always have something that gets a little bit stronger.  We lost one lead singer.  We gained another one who had more talent, who has more ability, and who has fit in this group like a finger in a glove.  Johnnie Carter took Johnny Funches's place.  Johnny Funches's wife more or less gave him an ultimatum.  "You either sing with the Dells [Barksdale's R&B group] or you stay home with your family," and he decided to stay home with his family. And at that particular time [1960], we were getting ready to go with Dinah Washington [singer].  We had done an audition for her in Chicago [Illinois], and she was, at that time, leasing or whatever of the Roberts Show Club [Chicago, Illinois], and it was then called Dinah Land.  I don't know how many people remember that, but I'm going to remind them there was once a Dinah Land here in Chicago at 64th and King Drive.  Actually at that point it was South Park[way].  Now that's going back a minute.  Anyway, Dinah had chose us to go on the road with her and be her jazz opening vocal group.  A lot of people don't know that the Dells done a lot of jazz.  I've done my jazz.  They think that Take 6 and Double Six of Paris and the Hi-Los and the Four Freshmen [all vocal groups] are the only ones who sing jazz.  No, no, no, no.  We have a great, long, extensive, and a very broad musical history, and some of the people that I named earlier from Quincy Jones [composer, record producer] to Thad Jones [trombonist] to Dinah Washington to Joe Zawinul [pianist]--those people helped the Dells.  Kirk Stewart [vocal coach]--I mean, that brother taught the Dells how to sing jazz.  First--that was our first jazz teacher.  These are the things that helped to move the Dells into the realm where we are.
Story_ID: 2952
Speaker 1: Working with Dinah [Washington, singer] was a trip.  Tell us about that.
Speaker 2: That working for Dinah Washington was a trip, an experience, and something very much needed for the Dells [Barksdale's R&B group].  She taught us stage deportment. She taught us about being on time.  She taught us about spending her own money--that she didn't have to do to take us under her wings.  Oh, she was a B with a big B.  She could really put it on your tail, pal, but you know what?  She was that teacher that I was talking about earlier that I did not relate to when I was going to the regular school, but in the school of music, she tightened our lids up, brother.  She made us understand that this business here was nothing to play with, and she did it sometimes with great charm.  She did it sometimes to the point to where you was ready to choke her, but then she did it sometimes when you just wanted to love her because she took us under her wings and gave us that respect, that admiration, and some things that we needed in order to sustain in this business.
Speaker 1: We're gonna get back to another thing that we didn't finish, but before we do that--how did you meet Dinah Washington?  Why did she get interested?  Give us the specifics of all that.
Speaker 2: In 1961 Dinah Washington was holding auditions at the club [Roberts Club, Chicago, Illinois] where she was leasing or whatever, Dinah Land, and we heard about it.  We went down to audition.  She didn't want a doo-wop group.  We knew this much.  Fortunately we had enough jazz songs under our belt, we figured, "well, if she liked that sound or this sound we were bringing to her, then maybe we would get a gig."  We went down--and see, Dinah liked you for a lot of reasons.  She either liked you because you looked good, young men, and you can sing, and all those things combined, you got a gig.  We had all of that, and it took us to some other heights.  It took us to--immeasurably, because some of those places we had played before--as an example, the Apollo Theater in New York [New York]--we had been through there singing 'Oh, What A Night,'' doo-wop, whatever. And people saw us up on the stage with Dinah Washington singing 'You Stepped Out of a Dream' and waltzin' around on the stage.  They said "them brothers have lost their damn mind.  They're up there.  What the hell are they doing now?"  But it was working because we were with Dinah Washington.  We were with the queen of the blues before Aretha Franklin [singer], before whomever.  This is the queen of the blues, and before her was Bessie Smith [singer].
Story_ID: 2953
Speaker 1: Let's get back to something that those of us in show business know about, you know, about that bad fall.  At one point you were walking down the street with no money knocking on doors, trying to make it.  Just again, how did that happen?  How did that feel?  How did the Dells [Barksdale's R&B band] come out of it? That's a big order.
Speaker 2: We have, we have never really been to the point to where we were all the way down--thank goodness.  We managed to reach a point where things were unstable, but we never got to a point to where we just laid back and said "well, the system, they ain't helping us, the record company don't want to help us, blah, blah, blah."  Well, God helps those who help themselves.  We pulled ourselves up by our bootstraps because there were five of us, man, and we could wrap our arms around each other and talk about things.  Even to this day, we have weekly meetings so we can sit down and just look at each other, talk to each other, see what's on your mind, see what's on my mind.  If we got something that's troubling one of the guys, talk about it, put it on the table. And we keep this thing alive because it does not always come down to economics and finances.  It comes down to love and understanding and respect. As black men, especially--it's very important because these are missing ingredients that we have in our race, so how can I sit down and tell my son about being together if we're not together. But he sees the togetherness that there is within the Dells, and we try to transcend all these kind of wonderful things, man, as we go around the country. And people have shown so much love to us, and it works.
Story_ID: 2954
Speaker 1: Teddy Pendergrass [singer] saga.
Speaker 2: Teddy Pendergrass--wow.  I may joke at this sometimes, but it's very serious.  Teddy Pendergrass is probably one of our dearest friends.  I feel so much in terms of pain for him for the unfortunate things that happened to him physically or whatever, but Teddy really got his whole vocal beginnings style-wise at that point.  It changed later on.  He became his own person, but he got that style from Marvin Junior [of the Dells, Barksdale's R&B group].  He was purposely, purposely chosen to sound like Marvin Junior.  The story being Leon Huff [pianist, songwriter] and Gamble--Leon Huff and Kenny Gamble [songwriter, producer] had a label deal with Chess Records [record company], and it was called Neptune Records [record label].  It seemed as though Leonard Chess [record producer]--and he was good for this--owed Leon Huff and Kenny some monies, royalty monies, and he wanted them to produce an album on the Dells.  Kenny Gamble, being the businessman that he is even today, said "well, if you pay us our royalties, we'll do an album on the Dells.  We like their sound, blah, blah, blah."  Leonard, being as slow on the draw as he at signing that check, didn't give it up fast enough, so there was a group back in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] called Harold Melvin and the Blue Notes [R&B group].  They had a drummer by the name of Teddy Pendergrass.  They pulled the drummer off the drums, and Kenny Gamble said "this brother here can sing.  I want you to sound like this guy right here."  He was talking about Marvin Junior.  Well, it just so happened that his voice fit the script, and it just worked, and they came out with an album called 'I Miss You,' and you talkin' about a dagger in the back.  It sounded just like the Dells--to a great degree.  They didn't have a bass singer.  I was glad of that, and it left me just a little bit of edge. But the rest of it was happening, brother, believe me. And then there was Teddy Pendergrass--who Harold Melvin [singer] wasn't too happy with because he was beginning to get all of the kudos, all of the accolades.  Everything was coming to Teddy Pendergrass.  He would like tell Teddy "man, wait a minute.  Man, this group is called Harold Melvin and the Blue Notes."  People would say "yeah, but that guy who was standing up there blowing that big voice, his name ain't Harold Melvin.  It's Teddy Bear." And Marvin Junior and Teddy Bear today, Teddy Pendergrass, today are very, very, very close.  I always teased Teddy on stage when I introduced Marvin, and I'd say "this is"--I'd say "you have to ask Teddy's mom, but I think this might be Teddy's daddy."
Speaker 1: At the time, how did Marvin feel about that?
Speaker 2: You know how insensitive Marvin can be about certain things.  He may have, he may have felt--he may have felt that knife in his back being twisted real good, and then at the same time, it may not have really bothered him too much.  He's--Marvin's a big guy.  He's big in mind, big in heart.  He has an opportunity to show people his vocal talents every night, every night that we work, and I don't think it really affected him that much.
Story_ID: 2955
Speaker 1: You know, you have another lead singer who's just awesome on 'Stay In My Corner.'  You never really finished.  He's the one who replaced Johnny Funches, the ex-lead singer from the Flamingos. Johnnie Carter [singer]. Tell us about Johnny Carter.
Speaker 2: Johnny Carter, the little, the little genius, the little--I call him the world's greatest tenor.  Oh, you hear about the Smokey Robinsons [singer], you hear about the [Al] Russells [singer] and the--you hear about all the great leads are great tenors, Eddie Kendricks [singer].  You never hear about Johnny Carter.  Well, you're gonna hear about him now.  Johnny Carter is one of the baddest that ever sat in front of the microphone.  He's ingenious when it comes down to vocal harmonies.  Johnny Carter can sing any part that there is to be sang in a vocal group.  From tenor and yeah, all the way down to the bass parts.  When I'm singing the lead or whatever, he sings the bass part.  Johnny Carter is incredible.  He's just a great talent, a great brother, and I love him.
Story_ID: 2956
Speaker 1: After the string of hit records run out, then what? Then you're back down, I mean--.
Speaker 2: Come back to reality.
Speaker 1: Yeah. Well--.
Speaker 2: There are reality checks in show business that--are we rolling? There are reality checks in show business that brings a brother or a sister back to reality.  It's very necessary.  I think sometimes we fly too high in the so-called friendly skies, and if God is not up on your wings, brother, you fall fast. So as we travel through this craziness called show business and try to figure out "well, how come I ain't got another hit record," or "how come I ain't got so and so," well, maybe you don't deserve it at this time.  Maybe this is the time for you--now is recess time.  Remember when you were going to school, grammar school, whatever, the teacher got tired of you all bugging her, and she threw you out in the playground for awhile.  "Go out and have a recess for a little while.  Cool out.  Get your head straight.  Come on back inside."  This is--on the other side of being grown, so-called, we found out early as young brothers in this business, ain't nobody going out there man, and knocking no doors down for the Dells [Barksdale's R&B group].  We got to knock these doors down ourselves.  We have to be our own promoters to a great degree.  We have to find the disc jockeys and the brothers that can be friends of us or be friends to us--the E. Rodney Joneses [disc jockey] who are no longer here in Chicago [Illinois] but were here years ago to help pave the way, the Herb Kents [disc jockey, interviewer], the Lucky Cordells [disc jockey].  These were brothers that helped pave the way for the Dells here in Chicago, helped stabilize us. So every time that we thought that things were on the down side, they were there for a reason. And the reason being that we needed this in order to help stabilize our minds to give us more fuel for us to move forward in life as we have been able to move forward.  We're the oldest group in the world, brother.  We've been together forty-eight years.
Story_ID: 2957
Speaker 1: Yes, but at one time did you not leave the Dells [Barksdale's R&B group]?
Speaker 2: I left the Dells in the early part, 1955. But we're talking forty-five years ago, and that time was done for a reason.  That time, that was another wake-up call 'cause as 'Oh, What A Night' was being released, I was in Cincinnati [Ohio] with another group called the Charms, Otis Williams and the Charms.  The bass singer had left the group for whatever reason, and I happened to run into Otis Williams[singer]--I think we were in Detroit [Michigan]--and Otis said "man, can you come over here and do some things with us?"  Well, you know, how did I know that a so-called weekend was going to end up being six or seven months. But it was a nice six or seven months because it took me some places that I had not been in terms of show business.  When that show business bug bites you, it's a hell of a bite.  It just kind of says "well, okay, studio, let's go sing.  Gig, let's go do it."  You know, it's like "let's do it," and there are friends of mine who were aspiring to be guitar players.  They know what I'm talking about.  They wanna play guitar, but they're catching hell doing it.  They had to keep practicing (laughs).
Story_ID: 2958
Speaker 1: We need to talk about Verne [Laverne Allison, singer] and more about Mickey [Michael McGill, singer].
Speaker 2: As we speak about, which is very important, most important--we spoke about, we've spoken about Marvin Junior [singer].  We've spoken about Johnny Carter [singer]. But we haven't spoken about Michael McGill and, Laverne Allison, and these are two very extremely important brothers in the group.  Each one plays a very important role and a very important part.  Michael McGill is probably the best paperkeeping person I have ever met in my life.  He can go back and relate to paperwork that we had back at Vee-Jay Records [record company], and that's almost unbelievable.  Okay, if I don't say this, I'll have to knock him out.  He's the greatest baritone singer in the world.  Mickey can sing.  Hey, Mickey, I'm talking about you, okay?  He's the greatest baritone--I said this.  He's the greatest baritone singer in the world, okay?  Whew.  I've said that.  Now Verne Allison is our second tenor.  Verne is the one that kind of, kind of puts the glue inside of the harmonies.  Our harmonies are so great--and I mean our harmonies are great because we know how to sing.  We were taught how to sing, and each one of our vocal parts is very, very necessary.  It's like the knit that goes into the weave.  Each stitch is very, very important, and it just kind of holds things together.  Verne's there.  Verne's necessary like each one of us are.
Story_ID: 2959
Speaker 1: Explain this to me.  In my experience, members of groups such as yours are closer than brother and sister, closer than family?  Is that true and why?
Speaker 2: It's true up to a point.  Let me just elaborate on this.  We [the Dells, Barksdale's R&B group] do not hang out with each other.  We did years ago.  We're more family men now.  There's a point of understanding that there's more to--we used to work a lot of nightclubs so going to a nightclub now is for what?  We've been in all them nightclubs.  We've worked in some of the most fabulous nightclubs in the world. So we reserve that time for when that time comes when we go to work.  We speak--like I said, we have meetings every Wednesday.  That's to just keep everybody's feet on the ground, everybody in touch and in tune with each other, just to hear what somebody may have to say--whether be it good or bad, we talk about it.  We try to remove as much negative, as much negative craziness that comes up around us, 'cause it comes all the time. And being from Chicago [Illinois], Harvey [Illinois], it gives us--when we go around the world--and we go around the world quite a bit--we get an opportunity to say "oh, man, that reminds us of so and so, and that's blah, blah, blah." But there ain't nothing like landing at O'Hare [International Airport, Chicago], getting off that plane, and you know you're back home.
Story_ID: 2960
Speaker 1: What's the cohesion and tell us about the pact you made never to break up when they tried to take your lead singer away.
Speaker 2: What has kept the Dells [Barksdale's R&B group] together?  I think you would probably talk to each one of the Dells and get somewhat close to, if not possibly the same, answer.  Things happened to us that in some instances we had no control over.  There was a guy named Al Perkins [disc jockey], who was a disc jockey out of Detroit [Michigan] at one point in time, who had management on the Dells for about five minutes, and we just didn't see eye to eye, but his whole intent and purpose was to pull Marvin Junior [singer] out of the group and cut an album on him. But you see, he didn't have the right intentions all the way down the line financially, so the money that he was offering Marvin--Marvin, he might have looked crazy, but he ain't crazy.  He didn't go for it.  That helped put the glue back into the Dells.  There are other little small things that happened over the years.  It helped tighten us up.  As we saw that, this industry was not meant for us to be apart.  This industry was meant for us to be together, and each time that something would come up that would be a so called cause for us to break up, something else would come along to circumvent that and just kind of bring us back together.  We would just say "man, whew!  We didn't go for that one," you know. And they're too numerous to even try to mention because after forty-eight years, you know, there had to be two or 300 of them, different--I mean steady nitpicking and steady back biting.  Somebody would say "well, so and so said something about you, Chuck, or somebody said something about Mickey [Michael McGill, singer] or somebody said something about Marvin, blah, blah, blah."  This is what caused us over, after a great period of time for us to sit down and say "hey, man, listen, we need to have a meeting every week.  We don't need for things to fester and get rotten and stinking and just get out of order so every week let's meet."
Speaker 1: Tell us about the pact to stay together. Did you cut wrists? Put blood together?  Put it on paper?
Speaker 2: This is, this is--what happened, what happened to keep the Dells together, man, cannot be denoted in terms of we said "we're going to be together for so and so and we're not going."  No, we didn't do that.  This is God's plan, brother.  We didn't cause this to happen.  We're just here because we're supposed to be here.  There are 900,000 groups in the world that are not together today because they're not supposed to be together today.  The Dells are together today because we're supposed to be.  The Four Tops [R&B group] are together because they're supposed to be.  The Spinners [R&B group] are together.  There's just a few groups that came from a certain period that are together--we can count on one hand--that are black groups.  This is what we're trying to preserve is the black music or black stand-up vocal groups. Because your younger groups that have come along today, they can't stand in our boots today--the N'Syncs [vocal pop group], the Backstreet Boys [vocal pop group], and so forth and so on.  God bless them.  They're doing their thing to get a lot of money behind them, but they're not the same.  They're not the same fiber.  It's not the same ingredient.  They were put together in another kind of manner.  We were molded together.  This was something that came together because of love and admiration and an idea, and it happened, and it's here, and it works.
Speaker 1: I think you're far closer together with each other than you want to admit, that's what I think.
Speaker 2: Oh, I don't--I do not, I do not disagree that we're far--we're much closer--we miss each other tremendously from Thursday through Tuesday, and on Wednesday we bond again.  We do this all the time.  We understand the importance of togetherness.  We know that when one of us gets sick, the other four gonna there.  If three guys get sick, the other two gonna be there.  However it goes down, if a family needs something, everybody's there.  That's important.
Story_ID: 2961
Speaker 1: There's another bookmark in the life of the Dells [Barksdale's R&B group] that was both good and bad, the movie.  Tell us about that.
Speaker 2: 'The Five Heartbeats.' Wow. 1990, '91 [1991], I think it was.  Robert Townsend [director] came to a theater we were working in California to ask us if we minded him using two of our songs in an upcoming comedy that he was doing about black stand-up vocal groups. And two of the songs he wanted to use--quite naturally--'Stay in My Corner' and 'Oh, What A Night,' two tremendously huge songs by the Dells.  When he asked that question, Marvin Junior [Dells singer] said "hold it.  Wait a minute.  What's your name?  Robert Townsend?  Let me tell you something right now.  Ain't nothing funny about being a black stand-up vocal group.  Number one, this shit's serious out here, brother.  We got no time for no laughing and joking about this.  Out here on this road it's rough.  We're catching hell from all ends, from black folks, white folks, Jews, Italians, Spanish people, you name it.  Everybody's kickin' us in the butt, but we strong.  We're standing up for this."  Robert said "wait a minute, man.  I wasn't trying to get offensive or whatever," he said, "but how long are you guys out on the road?"  So I think Marvin told him "well, we're out here for about another six weeks."  He said "well, can I ask you a question?  Can I travel around with you guys because it seems like you guys got a story that you want to tell."  Now understand something.  If we had had one of those Jewish managers or one of them Italian managers or whatever, he'd have chimed in right then and said "hold it.  Wait a minute.  We've gotta have a contract.  We've got to do so and so, so and so."  Things that are meant to happen, can't nobody stop it from happening.  No, we did not get paid the humungous piece of money that we probably should have gotten for this, but the publicity we got from this was fantastic.  People loved that movie.  They loved the Dells' story. And as we go around the country, they know this story is about the five Dells.  Though it was called 'The Five Heartbeats.'

Speaker 1: When you have a song that somebody else sings, they got young singers to do some doo-wop singing and stuff.  How many of the original songs did you really sing in that movie?
Speaker 2: We [the Dells, Barksdale's R&B group] didn't sing anything in the movie.  In the movie 'The Five Heartbeats,' we sang nothing.  We sang a soundtrack to the movie which was 'A Heart Is a House for Love,' which ended up being the first soundtrack off of the album--excuse me--that ended up being a super smash.  We were just overwhelmed with the success of this one song off this album.
Speaker 1: But, let's get back to the--why did you get somebody else to sing those songs, why did you not use the Dells?
Speaker 2: They were cheaper. They were--(laughs).
Speaker 1: They were paid to sing your songs?
Speaker 2: Oh, well, no, 'Stay in My Corner' and 'Oh, What A Night' were actually licensed to go into the movie.  The other songs were not our songs.  The other songs were sang by other artists.  I haven't the slightest idea who they were--four or five guys named Joe.  I don't know who they were, but the point is is that they worked.  The thing that really worked, and I'm saying this because I'm just being braggadocious and I'm caring about one group and that's the Dells, the fact that we had a smash record that came out of that.  The people showed us how much they loved us.  They loved the movie, and I'm telling you everywhere we go, people just love that movie.  They talk about the video.  They went out and bought it.  Some people stole somebody's video, and they got mad, and they had a fight over this.  The mothers and daughters are bringing their kids to the show to see the Dells.  I said "oh, this is just fantastic." New life.
Story_ID: 2963
Speaker 1: Yeah, but what about the downside, about all of your footage ending up on the cutting room floor?
Speaker 2: Well, you know what?  That's par for course for the Dells [Barksdale's R&B group].  We weren't looking for any miracles.  When Robert [Townsend, director] told us he was going to put us in a movie ['The Five Heartbeats'], we said "yeah, right."  Then he said "you guys want to do the cameo," and we said "yeah, right." "And we gonna so and so"--so when they told us that the movie portion for the Dells, the cameo, the whatever you want to call it, hit the cutting floor, we said "okay, next."  I'm serious, man.  We look for no--we look for no great love or no great whatever from anybody in this industry.  When it happens, we say "fine, let's move on."  As long as we're together, that's most important.
Speaker 1: You don't feel used in that movie?
Speaker 2: In this business, you always get used.
Speaker 1: You got to be frank about this now.  You got a hit record.
Speaker 2: Yes, we got a hit record out of this movie.  That's all we really expected out of this movie.  We didn't realize that this movie was going to become so huge in the video stores.  Now this was not huge on the silver screen, because it did not depict the drugs and the gangs and all the rest of this crazy stuff that there was.  In that same time frame, there was a movie out called 'New Jack City' and 'Boyz 'N the Hood,' whatever.  It didn't depict that.  It showed too much love.  I mean, when I say it showed too much love, there was nobody--there was one guy in the movie, and that one guy in the movie, unfortunately, was supposed to have been--not Eddie Kendricks [singer]--was supposed to have been David Ruffin [singer who struggled with substance abuse], okay?  Well, Hollywood [motion picture industry] had to try change things around, make things look a little bit more--but hey, it had nothing to do with the Dells.  It had nothing to do with it.  We did not have that kind of problem.
Story_ID: 2964
Speaker 1: Let's get to the good part.  That movie ['The Five Heartbeats'] put new blood into the Dells [Barksdale's R&B group].
Speaker 2: Oh, most definitely.
Speaker 1: Tell us all the good things for the Dells.
Speaker 2: The good thing that happened for the Dells, it gave us new life.  It gave us a chance to perform before audiences that we were not performing before.  For an example, before this single came out, before this hit, we were performing before the mothers and fathers.  Then when this movie came out, and it became a smash like it did, we found mothers, fathers, and the kids coming to the shows to see the Dells, which was fantastic. So we had a cross-generation of things that was developing.
Speaker 1: Did you get more gigs?
Speaker 2: Oh, we worked--we're still working off of that record.  I mean ten years later [2000], we're still working off of it.  That's why we're glad we have a new album out.  That helps.
Speaker 1: What are some of the things that happened to you after the movie that were not happening before?  You got more money for performing?
Speaker 2: We got more money for performances after the hit record.  We got a lot of publicity.  We're still working on that.  I'm like Muhammad Ali now.  You can't get enough publicity.  You got to give me some publicity.  Dinah Washington [singer] told us years ago, "I don't care what they say about you.  Just make sure they spell your name right."
Speaker 1: And you did get credit at the end of the movie, when they show a picture of the Dells.
Speaker 2: 97 percent of the people had gone home by then.
Speaker 1: Well, that was a bad thing.
Speaker 2: Now that 97 percent, that's not gonna help. That answer is not gonna help. Because that would only be him talking about 97 percent of the people.
Speaker 1: Okay, at the end of the movie, at the end of 'The Five Heartbeats' movie, they did a thing.  They called the Dells technical advisors.  Well, the trailer is running, and 97 percent of the people have gotten up and left the theater so they didn't even see the trailer part that said the Dells, technical advisors.  Nice picture of the Dells, that's all fine and good. But the 3 percent, believe me, is better than no percent because those are the ones that remember that this movie was about the Dells' life story.
Story_ID: 2965
Speaker 1: Honestly, what do you think of Robert Townsend [director]?
Speaker 2: I think of Robert Townsend as an opportunist.  I think he's a businessman.  I think Robert Townsend did what he was supposed to do in terms of business. Because, like I said earlier, it's business show.  You can get mad all you want to, but the business is not going to change.  It's cold-blooded, pal.  The barracudas will chew you up.  The sharks will drag you under.
Speaker 1: Did you not feel that he favored younger people over older people?
Speaker 2: Most definitely.  It just so happened that we were the ones that brought him the story, per se.  I don't think we were his favorite picks or favorite kids or favorite guys.  I think he just did what--you know, to tell the Dells [Barksdale's R&B group] "well, we're going to put you in the movie.  We're going to do this.  We're going to do the cameo part," and so forth and so on.  It could've worked.  I'm not going to say it should've worked.  It could've worked.  I think that what happened is--you give somebody just enough--you say to them exactly what you think they want to hear, and that's basically what happened.
Story_ID: 2966
Speaker 1: Tell me about the most awesome performance, most stirring performance, and where was it?
Speaker 2: To break down and say where the most stellar performance and whatever that the Dells [Barksdale's R&B group] ever did is almost trying to pick out what fish do you want out of the Pacific Ocean.  There's so many.  I mean, we've done fantastic shows for many, many years.  We killed them, we killed them at Carnegie Hall in New York [New York] when we were singing nothing but jazz working with Ray Charles [singer, pianist].  We got five standing ovations.  We did five songs, we got five standing ovations. And people were just amazed that the Dells from the doo-wop era were standing up on this stage at Carnegie Hall singing jazz.  They could not believe this.  They stood.  They clapped.  Leonard Feather [jazz critic], one of the great jazz critic writers--he said "I've never heard anybody like this."  He was just overwhelmed. And it was like a walk through the park for us because we had been so well groomed, so well trained. And for us to walk on stage in front of Ray Charles' big sixteen-piece orchestra and us standing up there singing--we had some great charts that were already written for us.  Man, we were just like having a ball.  It was like Michael Jordan [basketball player] playing basketball.  It was fantastic.
Story_ID: 2967
Speaker 1: Now, everything is not everything is peaches and cream.  Let's have the worst performance.
Speaker 2: Worst performance--the first time we went to the Apollo Theater [Harlem, New York].  We had an arrangement written on 'Oh, What A Night.'  The arranger--I could not remember his name, but he was a heroin junkie.  Unbeknownst to us, we get to the Apollo, and I'm the one that's carrying the music, didn't have a music case.  We had a little bag. I think the chart was down in the bag.  I pulled the music out of the bag, and the musical director's name was Phillips, Reuben Phillips.  Reuben says "okay, Dells, you're up next for rehearsal."  Now everybody's down in the basement, all the so-called fans and whatever, 'cause they want to know "who in the hell is this that's singing this big, bad record, 'Oh, What A Night?'"  Here we are down there, five guys from Harvey [Illinois].  We didn't know what to expect so I passed the music to Reuben.  Reuben passes it out to the band.  Long story short, the guy had written the song in the wrong key.  It was too low.  Now in the band--in the band happened to be a young man that saved the day for the Dells [Barksdale's R&B group], and if I can't think of this man's name, it's a shame.  This is the first big band arrangement that the Dells ever had in life that was correct.  This is terrible.  I'm looking right at his face.  The man--can we pause this for a minute?  Thank you.  Wait a minute, man.  This man's name is so important.
Speaker 1: Did he save the performance?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: We're really interested though, too. I say "everything's not peaches and cream." Was there a bad performance?  Did the lights go out?  It's cold?  Didn't get paid? Small audience?
Speaker 2: I'll give you--I'll give you a real downer.
Speaker 1: Are we rolling?
Speaker 2: Yeah. Let's roll. Bad performance, bad time, bad--didn't get paid, whatever.  We were, we were working with Patti LaBelle and the Bluebelles [R&B group], and we were in--I believe it was North Carolina where the tobacco guys had put together two big flatbed trucks, and the point is that we worked the show.  Little Esther [singer] was on the show.  Now it's time to get paid.  We're off.  Patti LaBelle [singer] and them are off.  Little Esther had to literally pay our way back home 'cause the promoter had left. And Patti LaBelle--I'm going to remind Patti of this, I'm going to see Patti real soon.  I'm going to remind her of this because this is one of those down times that you have to remember and have to reflect on, because these are the things that help--that test your will, pal, because a lot of people would say "hey, man, the hell with this business here.  We ain't getting paid.  I can stay home and do bad." But those are some of the things that help to just stabilize you a little more, if that's what you really want to do, and it's harder for a group, because one guy can easily say "hey, man, I can't handle this," and just leave. As Johnny Funches [former Dells singer] did at one point in time.  His wife gave him the ultimatum--"either stay home with your family or go out there with them Dells, and take your chance."  Well, you know, he stayed home so that's--.
Story_ID: 2968
Speaker 1: Patti [LaBelle, singer]--you mentioned her name.  Why would you remind her of that [incident in which Barksdale's R&B group the Dells did not get paid for performing]?
Speaker 2: I think in terms of speaking to Patti, we're that kind of friends.  There are things that we need to remind each other of that help to stabilize us, that help us just to, to just kind of say "this is from whence we came," and "these are some of the things that helped us to be where we are today." Not as a downer.  This is just as a reminder.  This is, this is good.  You know, somebody wrapped their arms around us, Patti.  We've got to do this for other people.
Story_ID: 2969
Speaker 1: I'd like to chronicle your songs.  Start with the first one that I remember, 'Tell the World,' which was the first song you ever recorded at a record company.  Can you do that?
Speaker 2: 'Tell the World.' That's what I'm doing right now.  I'm telling the world.  This is history, brother.  It had to begin somewhere, but that was not our first record.  Our first record was under the name of the El Rays, and that record was called 'Christine,' and on the other side was--I'm looking right at the record--this boy's memory really slipping past.  One side was called 'Christine' and I know--'Darling, Dear I Know.'  That was the name of the song.  Now that was the worst record ever recorded by any vocal group 'cause we didn't know what part we were supposed to sing.  All I knew I was supposed to be the bass singer, and everybody else just kind of go for yourself. And if you know the words, and you sing the lead, and we'll just kind of meet at the end of this track, and goodnight, Irene, and that's when Leonard Chess [record producer] told us "I think you guys better go get your jobs.  Keep your jobs, and Marvin Junior [Dells singer], you can't sing.  You ain't going never be able to sing, and next."  That's the worst song.  'Tell The World,' next to the worst song, second song we cut, and that song we cut over at Vee-Jay Records [record company].  I don't know what that song was even about.  You know, back during the so-called day, guys used to just write words that meant--that were senseless in terms of story.  I think one of the first stories I ever heard that was well written by a songwriter, so-called, was written by Smokey Robinson [singer, songwriter], and I said "man, this guy wrote a real story."  Everybody else was saying "man, you know what?  I love you baby, and we're going to go on down the road, and then you're going to take my handkerchief and wipe your eyes," and so on and I said "what's that got to do with anything," but it was so-called a song. And during those times, you could get away with--do you remember back during the day they have Parrot Records [record company] which was owned by Al Benson [disc jockey], and there were some other labels, about 20,000 different labels, and everybody had songs on there.  If you could have a song that had a little beat for the dance time, and so forth and so on, then you was cool.  We even cut a song back in the day called 'Bossa Nova Bird.'
Story_ID: 2970
Speaker 1: In the years that followed,  the first record we [the Dells, Barksdale's R&B group] recorded over at Vee-Jay [Records, record company], which was 'Tell the World,' we came behind that with songs like 'Why Do You Have to Go?'  Some other songs I can't remember right now 'cause there was so many little bitty songs in between that came before 'Oh, What A Night' in 1956. And after that things just kind of steamrolled, after 'Oh, What A Night' to the year 1958 where we had this [automobile] accident which kind of--well, not kind of--it stopped everything.  Everything just came to a screeching halt.  We--we came back into show business technically in 1960, and we continued on.  We were probably one of the more sought-after background vocal groups in Chicago [Illinois].  We sang behind Barbara Lewis [singer], behind Jerry Butler [singer], behind Gene Chandler [singer].  We sang behind everybody.  It was a way of making another point of living.  We made some good to decent money during that time frame while we were trying to get ourselves back in gear as we didn't know, but now we move up to--when Vee-Jay was getting ready to fold up, we were getting ready to spring forward and didn't know it.  In 1964 Vee-Jay is getting ready to go out the back door.  They're losing--I mean, the IRS [Internal Revenue Service] closes them down. But as it had happened before, we sprang back and forth from Chess Records [record company] to Vee-Jay.
Story_ID: 2971
Speaker 1: Going back to Vee-Jay Records [record company] and the first record we [the Dells, Barksdale's R&B group] recorded at Vee-Jay, which was 'Tell the World,' there were four or five other songs that came out after that before 'Oh, What A Night' which was 'Distant Love,' 'Q-Bop She Bop.'  Let me see--'Pain in My Heart.'  There was 'Dreams of Contentment.'  There was, oh, 'At the Bandstand,' and I'm being prompted (laughs).  Memory's short.  No, that's not one of the songs. But I think those songs there kind of give you an idea that we were still in the recording business--that we had not had a smash record yet. But it was after 'Why Do You Have To Go' that 'Oh, What A Night' came--I'm sorry.  'Oh, What A Night' came first, and then 'Why Do Have To Go?' came.
Story_ID: 2972
Speaker 1: 1964 we were with Vee-Jay Records [record company], and unfortunately for the Dells [Barksdale's R&B group] and all the artists over there, they were losing out.  They were getting ready to be closed down by the Internal Revenue [Service], and it took us all to a point where we had no label. So in 1965, late, early '66 [1966], we had an opportunity to travel with Ray Charles [singer, pianist] for some six months, and we traveled to all various colleges and whatever and did a lot of great engagements with him.  In fact, that's when we ended up doing the show at Carnegie Hall [New York, New York].  We got all these wonderful standing ovations and whatever.  We went on from there to 1966.  We ended up getting another contract back at Chess Records [record company] again.
Story_ID: 2973
Speaker 1: In 1966 we [the Dells, Barksdale's R&B group] went back to Chess Records [record company] for the--which was really the third time--and we started recording new songs that were produced by and written by a young brother by the name of Bobby Miller [record producer] and arranged by Charles Stepney [songwriter].  Now this is the real good part about it.  We're at Chess Records, and everybody over there at Chess Records--Leonard Chess [record producer] has called in a production meeting, and he's asking everybody, whoever is on the roster, name who you want to produce.  Well, nobody wanted to produce the Dells.  Bobby Miller jumped up and said "let me have the Dells," and everybody else said "well, you can have them.  Man, they're some old guys."  I think we must have been in our early thirties at that time.  They said "man, man, you can have 'em."  Well, little did they know we were going to have such a long, long, long string of smash records. And Leonard Chess told them later on, as a couple of them wanted to come over, producers wanted to come over and produce us.  He said "no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  You don't want the Dells.  Bobby Miller is producing them, Bobby Miller and Charles Stepney.  Those are the producers and the arrangers for the Dells, and we were selling tons and millions and tons and millions and millions and millions of records." and that's brought us up through up until the time of Leonard Chess's demise.  He passed, early '70 [1970, sic, 1969], and kind of snatched the strength from the Dells because he was Chess Records.  It wasn't just Chess Records and he was the acting president or whatever.  Leonard ran that record company as many people that are in the industry can attest to.  If they knew Leonard Chess, he ran it with an iron fist, and when he believed in an artist and it just so happened he believed in us--and I guess he did, we were selling tons of records--he would support us tremendously.  I think at that point in our career we were on a tremendous upswing, and once he died, so much was taken away from the Dells, even though we ended up still with more hit records.  'Give Your Baby A Standing Ovation,' 'The Love We Have Stays on My Mind'--all those records came after the demise of Leonard Chess. But it was something missing.  It's like that missing ingredient out of a good batch of hot rolls or something.  Something ain't right, you know?  It works, but it didn't really work and--but we knew that we had to continue on.  If we were to stay together, we must continue on.  We must do the things that we gotta do.  We gotta keep singing.  We gotta keep staying together.  We gotta keep rehearsing.  We gotta keep in touch with each other.  It was shortly after that we started thinking very strongly about meeting every week.  We had to meet every week.  If we don't meet every week, we can lose it.
Speaker 2: Name those hit songs that came in during this period.
Speaker 1: During the period between 1967 and 1973, we started off with 'O-o, I Love You,' 'There Is,' 'Wear It On Your Face.'  We had 'Stay In My Corner.'  We had 'Oh, What A Night,' which we, we were probably one of the first groups in life to re-record two major smash records, and they became smashes twice.  'Stay In My Corner' and 'Oh, What A Night'--both of them went to number ten on the pop charts, which was unbelievable.
Speaker 2: What about the R&B [rhythm and blues] charts?
Speaker 1: The R&B charts for both of those records and all those records at least went to number three,number four.  'Stay In My Corner' and 'Oh, What A Night' went to number one, and we had--we got a whole pile of gold records, platinum records.  We're still looking for the gold, though, the real gold.
Story_ID: 2974
Speaker 1: Tell us about that, how you changed lawyers and how you incorporated. I've been wanting to talk about that, so talk about that.
Speaker 2: We found ourselves--the Dells [Barksdale's R&B group] found ourselves as a--just a group and not an organization. And we found that in order for us to reap the better benefits, we'd better incorporate, which we did. And it's been very good for us inasmuch as it brought us around to a point where we understand very much about the corporate world.  Our corporation may be small, but it works.
Speaker 1: What did it do for you?
Speaker 2: It brought us more in tune with understanding the structure of payroll.  It brought us into the structure of insurances.  It brought us into the structure of understanding that we can expand from just being the Original Dells, Inc., then be the Original Dells Production Company.  We can produce other artists.  We have our own publishing company.  We have our own this, we have our own that, and it just--the umbrella is just fantastic, and it works. And I'd tell any young brother or young sister or whoever is aspiring to get into this business, you've got to incorporate.
Speaker 1: Is this when they decided to make you the spokesman, spokesperson?
Speaker 2: I don't know when that happened.  I don't know when I became the spokesperson.  I just started running my mouth, and things just started working, and the more they worked, the more they dumped the load on me, and I've been passing business cards out, and after awhile it became an everyday type thing.  Somebody would call Chuck Barksdale, and so and so and so.  As long as it works--I said as long as the boat floats, and the ducks are in a row, and you're winning, just keep on doing it, and just do it, do it to the best of your ability.
Speaker 1: Crooked managers.  Crooked attorneys.
Speaker 2: Crooked managers, crooked attorneys go with this business just like air is needed to breathe.  It's so unfortunate, but that's the nature of the beast of this business.  You find 99 and 44/100 percent crooked managers, and that other little small percentage is so small that sometimes it don't even count. But in some instances, they are some of the necessary evils because in this business, evil begets evilness, and evil is just what runs this whole business.
Speaker 1: Would a average record company do you a job if you don't protect yourself?
Speaker 2: Not the average record companies.  All record companies will do you a job.
Speaker 1: Explain that.
Speaker 2: Figures never lie.  Figurers do the lying.  If I have a set of books--or two or whatever necessary--and we put your record out, who's to say how many records I've sold or you sold or that we've sold on you, and how you gonna discount this?  If you--if the system comes up and says that you sold--we'll just use a hypothetical--five million records--that's a lot of records, brother.  Singles, CDs [compact discs], whatever, it's just a lot of records. And all of a sudden it's royalty time, and somebody says "well, you owe so much money for a recording session.  You owe so much for this, you owe so much for that. And we got a royalty check for you for $200,000." Seems like a lot of money, right?  Somebody got ripped off, probably you.  They're not gonna play the game fair, pal.  I think we saw this happen with Toni Braxton [singer].  I think we saw this happen with a lot of artists over the years.  It ain't nothing new.  I'm not saying anything to anybody that really understands this industry does not know the business is made up, record business is made up for record companies to be paid first.
Speaker 1: Tell us about who are your collectors, your organization.  Do you try to collect everybody's royalties from way back?
Speaker 2: Trying to collect royalties from way back is almost--I won't say it's an impossibility, but it's a rough row to hoe, pal. Because first of all, you gotta try to find an attorney--gotta try to find an attorney or a firm that will really not want to take all the money.  They go from 50 percent down to possibly thirty-three and a third or whatever, but they want a chunk.  Then they end up cutting a deal with the people that you're trying to get the money from so they're playing both ends against the middle.  It's a lose-lose situation, but on the other hand, if you don't have somebody that can get inside to cut the deal to get the money that's already rightfully owed to you, then you end up with 100 percent of nothing. So that's the way the game goes.  You know, what do you do?  You don't go after anything, so you end up with nothing. So if you go after somebody, then you end up with a pretty good percentage.
Story_ID: 2975
Speaker 1: You're talking right now to--coast to coast of the United States of America and possibly overseas. What would you like to say as a member of the Dells [Barksdale's R&B group]?  This is your chance to get it off your chest.
Speaker 2: As a member of the Dells, I'd like to say to the viewing public to hear me for just a moment.  I have no regrets.  I'm very proud.  I'm very strong-willed, and being with the brothers that I've been with for forty-eight years has been nothing but a pleasure.  Oh, we've had our differences, and we've disagreed, but we've never been disagreeable with one another.  That's important.  We've made a lot of friends along the way, and we have a lot of fans that have stayed with us.  We have a lot of people that we have yet to meet, and if God wills that we stay together for another ten years, five years, or whatever years--it's been a great ride, and I want to thank you.
Story_ID: 2976
Speaker 1: I'm in hopes that our music, the Dells' [Barksdale's R&B group] music, has influenced some of the younger generation.  I think that this history making film will probably give information to some of the younger folks--hopefully, that they will understand that this is not a hard-nosed business of sorts.  It is, if you don't apply yourself.  The music that we left here, the music that we leave here, the music legacy that we leave here is meant to show that through hard work, through togetherness, and through, definitely, talents and whatever, you can, you can make it out of here in this business.  It is meant for us to make it, but we cannot allow ourselves to shirk the responsibility of the music that's left here for the young kids, because it's not about the big Bs or the MFs.  It's about love. And that's what we've tried to transcend through all the years of the music that we've recorded.

Speaker 1: Why were you so eager to want to tell your story to The HistoryMakers?
Speaker 2: I wanted to tell my story or our story or my version of our story, because I thought it was time.  I'm just so thankful that a lady named Miss [Julieanna] Richardson [founder of The HistoryMakers] would even have a program of this sort.  I think it's very necessary because black history, black music is not once a month.  It's every day.  We are the creators of everything there is in this universe, music-wise, the whole nine yards, and we should be proud to talk about it, and I'm proud to speak of the Dells [Barksdale's R&B group].  These forty-eight years that we've been in this business, man, does not depict all the hard times that come through the slavery, and so forth and so on.  The brothers were singing out there in the cotton fields, you know, so for us to be singing now and putting it on records and people buying our records, I think this is--it is indeed a blessing.
Speaker 1: Where are the Dells going from here?
Speaker 2: Good question.  Where are we going from here?  Wherever God guides us.  We'll be ready--as the brothers used to say years ago, "have voices, will travel."

Speaker 1: What advice do you have for young people getting along now who want to come into this business?
Speaker 2: Anyone that wants to come into this business here, my first thought would be are you really, really ready to try this. Because this is not--this is a roller coaster.  This business has many peaks and many valleys.  Some people never get to the peaks.  Some people just stay in the valley.  If you endeavor to work at this, whether you want to become a radio personality, an entertainer on stage, football player or whatever, you've got to work, practice, practice, practice.  You've got to read.  The books are out here for you to read.  There are books on entertainment.  If that's where you want to go into the entertainment field, you can read.  There are so many different books, but there's one thing I want to tell you.  Experience is not the best teacher. It's the only teacher.  You've got to get out of here and fight in the trenches and be willing to give up--but not your will and not your respect for yourself, and that's why we must stop talking about these young kids out here and talk to them.  We've got to teach them.  If it takes a whole village to raise a child, let's start and let's get to work.

Speaker 1: Kirk Stewart [vocal coach]--who was he?
Speaker 2: Kirk Stewart--excuse me--Kirk Stewart was a Chicago pianist who--a jazz pianist to be exact.  His name was, his name was Kirk Kinchelow.  Kirk played jazz, and he accompanied Sarah Vaughan [singer].  He accompanied not Gloria Lynne [singer], but he accompanied--I see so many--Peggy Lee [singer].  He accompanied--oh, man, that's--he accompanied so many wonderful singers, mostly female singers. But for some reason he liked the sound of the Dells [Barksdale's R&B group], and he decided to take us under his musical wing and start teaching us harmonies.  Now understand something.  We did not go to [The] Juilliard [School, New York, New York].  We do not have degrees in music. An example being, we did a Buffalo [New York] Jazz Festival with Dinah Washington [singer] in 1961, and we preceded Dinah going onstage, and she let us do a fifteen minute slot up there. And there's 18,000 people at the Buffalo Jazz Festival, and they're just clapping, and they're just going crazy over these Dells. Here we come off the stage, and standing on the side of the stage are the Four Freshmen [vocal group], who are a white jazz group, a vocal group. And they said--now we're from Harvey, Illinois, and anybody who knows where Harvey, Illinois, is will understand this.  There's an ice cream parlor, and there's a street there.  There's 147th and Robey [Harvey, Illinois].  That's where everything is. So when we come off the stage, one of the guys in the Four Freshmen says "man, you guys are fantastic."  He said "where did you guys study?"  They said "we studied at Juilliard, where'd you guys study?"  We said "we studied at the ice cream parlor on 147th Street in Harvey" (laughs).
Speaker 1: Kirk taught you harmony?
Speaker 2: Yes, he literally sat down at the piano and picked the notes out for us.  We didn't know what we were doing, but it sure sounded good, and the more he taught us, the more we yearned to learn more. And the more we learned more, the more he wanted to teach us, and the more he taught us, the better our sound began to cultivate in terms of becoming a jazz vocal group.  He was very proud of us, and we were very proud to have him teach us. And then those things transcended to us meeting with Dinah Washington, and us meeting Quincy Jones [composer, record producer], us meeting Thad Jones [trombonist], and us meeting Joe Zawinul [pianist] who was the piano player for [Julian] "Cannonball" [Adderly, saxophonist].  We just, we met all the greats.  I mean, we were so blessed at this particular time frame from 1961 through '63 [1963].  We got a chance to go into the real jazz circle and meet with some of the greats that we wouldn't have met over on the so-called doo-wop side.

Speaker 1: Harvey Fuqua [singer, producer] of the Moonglows [R&B group] started the Spinners [R&B group].  What did he do for you?
Speaker 2: Harvey Fuqua took us [the Dells, Barksdale's R&B group] under his wings.  Excuse me.  Leonard Chess [record producer] asked him.  The Moonglows were recording for Chess Records [record company] also.  They had out huge records--'Sincerely,' and 'Most of All,' and 'Our Love is Like is a Seesaw, Baby,' blah, blah.  They had all kind of hit records. And Leonard knew that we needed some help, vocally. So he asked Harvey to take us under his wing, and Harvey is the first one that taught the Dells doo-wop changes to sing correctly, so that we can denote my not just singing bass notes but singing correct bass notes, and Mickey [Michael McGill, singer] singing correct baritone notes, and Verne [Allison, singer] singing correct second tenor, and Johnny [Carter, singer] singing correct first tenor, and following the script in terms of how music structure is supposed to go in terms of the melody, the harmonics, et cetera.
Speaker 1: Quincy Jones [composer, producer]?
Speaker 2: I laugh because we were doing an album with Dinah Washington [singer].  The name of the album was called 'Tears and Laughter.'  Quincy's dad was one of the arrangers, and Quincy decides he wants to sing in the background with us.  We were singing a song called 'Wake the Town and Tell the People.'  If you hear on that song somebody singing flat in the background, that's Quincy Jones. And I have teased Quincy about this any number of times.  "Quincy, keep your arrangement job.  Don't try to sing anymore, please."  Quincy's a great guy.
Speaker 1: What did he teach you?
Speaker 2: He taught us not to sing flat, for one thing (laughs).
Speaker 1: Did he do some musical things for you?
Speaker 2: Quincy Jones--what he did was he wrote out musical parts for us, background parts, that had to be taught to us on the piano, of course, 'cause nobody really reads music per se, and between Quincy and Dinah Washington, we ended up learning how to sing the background on the songs that we were singing behind Dinah on that particular album, 'Tears and Laughter.'
Speaker 1: Go on, I just want him to sing a refrain to something
Speaker 2: I hope we have time. You had mentioned another musical teacher.  You mentioned Quincy and--
Speaker 1: Joe Zawinul [pianist].
Speaker 2: Joe Zawinul.
Speaker 1: Joe Zawinul was a piano player.  He was a foreigner [from Austria].  Joe Zawinul was a piano player that played with [Julian] "Cannonball" Adderley [saxophonist], and one of the songs that he taught the background to the Dells for was 'What a Difference a Day Makes'--which we did not record that behind Dinah so we had to learn that to sing on her live performances in the various nightclubs, which is another funny story.  We were working in Atlantic City [New Jersey], and there was a balcony where we would sing the background behind Dinah up over the top of her on stage. So Dinah knew that we liked to play around and doing mischievous things in the dressing room, messing with the chorus girls--(pause) messing with the chorus girls--and what happened is she knew this so she would be singing a song or whatever, and Dinah had perfect pitch.  She would pick out the key out of the air and start singing 'What a Difference a Day Makes.' To go from the dressing room at that point over to the section where we had to sing over the top of the balcony was about a good 100, 110 feet or whatever. So you can just imagine Dinah starting to sing 'What a Difference a Day Makes,' and here we come.  We sound like a bunch of horses going (imitates a horse) 'til we get to the balcony part, and the people in the audience are going wild, 'cause they thought this was part of the act.  She blessed us out after the show.  We got fined pretty heavily (laughs).

Speaker 1: I've gotta get this in.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Sing your favorite song that you like to do with the Dells [Barksdale's R&B group].
Speaker 2: My favorite song?  That's really difficult because I don't sing lead to the point of really singing lead.
Speaker 1: What about bass singing that we might enjoy?
Speaker 2: I'll sing a little.  Wait a minute. (Singing) Those fingers in your hair. That smile, come-hither stare. That leaves my conscience bare, it's witchcraft.  I'm not singing anymore.  You can take this film, hit the floor. (Laughs).
Speaker 1: Hey, that's interesting, I didn't know you could sing.
Speaker 2: Hey, didn't know you [Herb Kent, interviewer] could interview (laughs).
