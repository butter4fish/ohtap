Speaker 1: This HistoryMakers [The HistoryMakers] interview is being conducted with Professor Simon Estes [HistoryMaker Simon Estes] at the School of Music in the College of Fine Arts at Boston University at 855 Commonwealth Avenue, Boston, Massachusetts.  The date is February 6, 2006.  The interviewer is [HistoryMaker] Robert C. Hayden and the videographer is Neculai Burghelea.  Mr. HistoryMaker, Professor HistoryMaker, would you give me your full name, please, and would you spell your name for me?
Speaker 2: Yes, my full name is Simon Lamont Estes.  That's S-I-M-O-N, capital L-A-M-O-N-T, and Estes, E-S-T-E-S.
Speaker 1: Thank you.  Professor Estes, what is your date of birth and where were you born?
Speaker 2: March 2nd 1938. I was born in Centerville, Iowa.
Speaker 1: Nineteen thirty-eight [1938], is that what you said?
Speaker 2: Nineteen thirty-eight [1938], yes.
Speaker 1: How would you describe or label your profession, your occupation?  What are you?
Speaker 2: I'm an opera singer, an international opera singer.  I sing in all of the major opera houses in the world, basically speaking, whether it be here in the United States, the Metropolitan Opera [Metropolitan Opera House, New York, New York]; Chicago [Illinois], San Francisco [California], Los Angeles [California], Boston [Massachusetts], Philadelphia [Pennsylvania]; La Scala [Milan, Italy] in Italy; Paris [France]; London [Royal Opera House, London, England], Berlin [Deutsche Oper Berlin, Berlin, Germany], Hamburg [Hamburg State Opera, Hamburg, Germany], Zurich [Zurich Opera House, Zurich, Switzerland]; Sydney, Australia; Vienna [Vienna State Opera, Vienna, Austria]. I've sung all over the world, all the major opera houses. So my main title--I'm known as an opera singer.  I have done a number of lectures and master classes throughout my, my career at various universities and institutions. And for the last six years, I had been a professor at Iowa State University [Ames, Iowa] and for the last year and a half here at Boston University, and also at Wartburg College, which is in Waverly, Iowa. It's a private college of a thousand eight hundred students and, and I also do a number of humanitarian things that we'll probably talk about later.

Speaker 1: For young people, for our youth, and you have a tremendous interesting track record in nurturing and helping young people, but for the young people who will look at this interview, how do you define opera?  By that I mean, what is characteristic of opera?  What distinguishes opera from other musical genre?
Speaker 2: Okay, the word opera, opera as we say it in English, opera means to work.  So it means, you have to work, but an opera is a musical drama that is of a classical nature.  In other words, it is not like a Broadway musical.  Also, opera singers have to be blessed with very special vocal chords because we sing without the use of any amplification.  So, for example, when I sing at the Metropolitan Opera House in New York City that has over four thousand seats, our voices have to be able to fill up that hall, singing through or over the orchestra, the place can go up to eighty-five, ninety, 100 members, and fill that house without any amplification.  So what separates opera singers from popular singers or jazz singers or any other type of singer, we never use microphones.  Now, I have to classi- be more specific and say never.  If I sing in a football stadium or a baseball stadium, a national anthem which I've done many times for events then, of course, you're using a microphone but in our professions themselves, as opera singers, in all of the opera houses around the world, we don't use microphones and we have to have these special vocal chords that enable the voice to project.  For example, you and I, we could probably, the greatest coaches in the world, and we could never run a hundred meters in less than ten seconds because we, we're not born with that natural gift.  Opera singers' voices are gifts from God, that they have these very special vocal chords that they're able to produce this voluminous sound that projects without amplification.
Speaker 1: How does one, who is born with that capacity, make a decision to become an opera singer?  I mean, I would assume that maybe only ten percent, or maybe less of those born with those vocal chords--so what are the things that turns one into an opera singer then?
Speaker 2: You usually have--
Speaker 1: I know you have to be trained--
Speaker 2: Yeah, you have to be trained--
Speaker 1: But--
Speaker 2: --but, you have to have an exposure, someone has to maybe discover you.  I was out at the University of Iowa [Iowa City, Iowa] studying to be a doctor.  I started college in 1956, transferred, in Centerville, Iowa, a little community college [Centerville Junior College; Centerville Campus of Indian Hills Community College], I transferred to the University of Iowa in 1957.  In 1961, a voice teacher came there named Charles Kellis, he heard me singing in a choir and he said, "You have a voice to sing opera."  I had never seen nor heard an opera in my life so I more or less said, "What is opera?"  He loaned me some recordings of Leontyne Price, Cesare Siepi, Eileen Farrell, Jerome Hines and then Rimsky-Korsakov's [Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov] 'Scheherazade,' which was a symphonic work.  I remember I took that back to my little dormitory room and I listened to those big old seven-thirty-three and a third, you know, recordings, records, and I took the room back, took them back to him the next day and I said, "You know I really like that stuff," that's, you know, I never heard, I just loved it. So, in quotes, many times wonderful singers are gifted people, whether it be in opera there is, they're discovered or someone. If it hadn't been for this man, I wouldn't be sitting here having an interview here today.  I might be a doctor.

Speaker 1: We always start the interview also with a few People magazine type questions to give those who will look at your interview know the slant on your personality.  Let me ask you a couple of straightforward, simple questions.  Professor, what is your favorite food?
Speaker 2: Well, that's kind of difficult but they're basic, I would probably say. I have to preface it first by saying, in the last forty years I've traveled all around the world so I've eaten from all the different kitchens, whether it's French, Italian, German, etcetera, but probably I'd say something very basic.  You give me some good mashed potatoes, good sweet potatoes, some fried chicken and fresh corn on the cob, I'll be very happy with some orange juice.
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite time of year?
Speaker 2: You know, I feel, I like, I prefer summers.  Summer's my favorite time of the year but I love winter if you have lots of snow 'cause I grew up with that in Iowa.  We had--the weathers changed now--when I was a kid growing up, we had a tremendous amount of snow and temperatures minus 30 degrees.  In the summer, it'd be 100 degrees but if I chose a time, it'd probably be summer or spring, but I like all the seasons.
Speaker 1: I was born and raised here in New England.  I have never gotten used to the snow.
Speaker 2: You haven't?
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: Oh, I love it.  Last year when that big snowstorm we had here--
Speaker 1: The last two winters have been--
Speaker 2: I wonder if that--the winter before the last one when they had that big, my wife had just driven all the way from Iowa on a Saturday afternoon, it started that night, I remember.  We went shopping at some grocery store called Shaw's or something. It started snowing and the next day, well you know, it's up to the meters.  I was like a little kid.  I loved it.
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Yellow.
Speaker 1: Yellow.
Speaker 2: A certain shade of yellow, not a strong yellow, not a lemon yellow and I, and I like beige.  I mean my studio here, my wife and I actually painted that.  You can see that it's a certain, it's a relaxing color, many times they say.
Speaker 1: You travel all over the world, you will continue to do that, but do you have a favorite destination, vacation destination or place you like to escape to when you're not performing and--
Speaker 2: When I want to escape, believe it or not, I want to go home to my home, to our home. In that I have traveled, as I said the last forty years, I probably mentioned that several times in this interview, I've been everywhere, every continent except the Antarctic [Antarctica], I have been to, and I have loved it.  It's been a great education.  It's been a cultural education as well as a musical education.  It's been a humanitarian education.  So, people often ask me that because I've been to the tropics.  I've been to Alaska.  I've been to Russia.  I've been to Africa.  I've been to South America.  I've been to Australia.  I've been to New Zealand and the United States.  I've been in the desert.  I've been in the mountains.  I've been blessed, I've seen a lot of God's creation.  So, if I just want to relax, I like to go home.
Speaker 1: Back home.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Last question of this nature.  Do you have a favorite phrase or saying that you like to use from time to time, something philosophical that you--
Speaker 2: I'm a very philosophical person, a very spiritual person and a phrase that I would like to use and always say is that we need to love one another and follow the two golden rules when God said the greatest commandment is to love your God with all of your heart, soul, mind and spirit, et cetera and to love your neighbor as yourself because, you see, love doesn't produce hatred or wars or anger, love is kind, it's generous, it's good.  So my phrases are, let's love each other as neighbors.

Speaker 1: Let's continue now looking at your family history, your family background, and let's start with your mother.  Would you give me her full name and the year she was born and where your mother was born?
Speaker 2: My mother's full name, her maiden name, and then I'll tell you Estes, of course, but her maiden name was Ruth Naomi [Ruth Jeter Estes], like in the Bible, Naomi Estes, E-S-T-E-S.  She was born in 1910 in Centerville, Iowa, March 30th and she just died a year and two months ago.  She was almost ninety-five.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She died, you know it'll be 2004.
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: November, 2004, November 4th to be exact, sorry.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What do you remember, what do you know about your mother's growing up, her early childhood years in Centerville?  What has she shared with you about those early years?
Speaker 2: Well she shared, obviously, a lot of her life.  My grandfather, on my mother's side, his name was Nathaniel Jeter.  My mother's maiden name, as I said, was Jeter and then her maiden name was Ruth Naomi Jeter and then became Estes when she married my father [Simon Estes], but they were very poor.  The food, her father used to go hunting and get squirrels and rabbits and ducks and that helped them to live and survive.  Needless to say, they did not have running water, indoor, no indoor toilet facilities, no central heating.  They, it was a family, she had two other sisters and three brothers.  They were economically speaking, very, very, very poor but they were very rich in faith and in respect for God and for other people and she shared this with me.  That was a very closely-knitted family.
Story_ID: 323543
Speaker 1: Did she [Estes' mother, Ruth Jeter Estes] ever share with you any stories about her growing up years, childhood, young adult years?
Speaker 2: She was very close to her father [Nathaniel Jeter] because her mother [Annie Jeter] died when she was a very young child and apparently she might have, might have been classified at maybe as my grandfather's favorite, her father's favorite, and he loved baseball and he used to take my mother to softball games in Centerville [Iowa], not real baseball games. And she used to say how close she was to her, to Papa, as they called him. And I remember he used to talk, she told me he used to talk to her about life, about philosophies and about how important it was for her and her other sisters to get good men.  I remember she said he used to say to her, he called her Baby many times, he said, "You know, Baby, I want you to be careful," she said.  "I want to tell you something," he said, "men are no good."  He said, "I should know I am one."  Not meaning he was bad but he knew about the men and he wanted his daughters to, to get good men that would be, that would be spiritual and they would be able to provide for them and if they got married and had children, provide for them economically.
Story_ID: 323544
Speaker 1: How do you remember your mother [Ruth Jeter Estes] in terms of her personality?  What was she like as a person?
Speaker 2: Well as I said, she just passed away a year and three months ago, or two months ago.  My mother had a great personality, had a great voice.  Had she not been born in 1910, she would have had an operatic career like Leontyne Price.  She had a phenomenal classical voice, was totally untrained, but she could sing soprano or mezzo-soprano or tenor.  My mother could sing almost as low as I could in a bass register.  So God gave her this phenomenal gift. And what I remember about my mother, she was a loving wife and a loving mother to all of us.  My mother and I, when I was less than twelve years of age, we read the Bible through together from cover to cover, three chapters a day and five on Sunday and in a year's time you finished the Bible.  We did that together.  She was a wonderful mother, she cooked every meal.  We came home from school, we ate together as a family.  Sometimes we didn't have much of a meal except for gravy, sometimes not even made out of milk, made out of water, and we'd eat it with bread but nonetheless she kept the house clean.  I remember my mother ironed all of my jeans.  I went to school, I might've only had two pair but they had creases in them, you could almost cut yourself.  She would iron my underclothes.  She cleaned the house, she took care of my, my father [Simon Estes] and my three older sisters [Patricia Estes, Erdyne Estes Whiteside, and Westella Estes] and me as a real Christian, caring, loving mother should.  My mother never even tasted alcohol in her life.  She never tried a cigarette in her life.  She only had one man in her life, that was my father.  So, and her whole life she always told us that, son, make sure you put the Lord first in your life, he is your only true friend who will never disappoint you.  So she brought us up with this great, great faith in, in God and in hoping to be able to have faith in the fellow human beings but she also warned me to be careful about that.

Speaker 1: How many siblings did you have?  You were born in 1938.
Speaker 2: Thirty-eight [1938].
Speaker 1: Tell me about your siblings.
Speaker 2: I have three sisters born before I.  One was born in '36 [1936], '34 [1934] and '32 [1932].  I ended up being the baby of the family.  And my oldest sister was a nurse, a registered nurse, graduated from Mercy Nursing College in Des Moines, Iowa.  She died at a very young age.  My second sister--her name was Patty, Patricia [Patricia Estes]--
Speaker 1: Patty, P-A-T-T--
Speaker 2: Yeah, well her real name was Patricia, but Patty we called her, Patty, P-A-T-T-Y.  My second sister whose name was Westella, W-E-S-T-E-L-L-A, Westella [Westella Estes], and she died in a horrible tragic car accident.  They honored me in Centerville, Iowa in the high school, they named an auditorium [Simon Estes Auditorium, Centerville High School] after me and she was driving back to Cedar Rapids, Iowa for the concert and she and my first cousin were both killed in a horrible car accident, so that's, was a kind of a tragic event.  And then my one remaining living sister, her name is Erdyne, E-R-D-Y-N-E [Erdyne Estes Whiteside], and she's married and living in Des Moines, Iowa.  She's two years older than I.  She will be, yeah, she'll be seventy the 25th of this month.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 323546
Speaker 1: Tell me about your, your mother's parents [Annie Jeter and Nathaniel Jeter] and, and how, how your mother [Ruth Jeter Estes] happened to be born in Centerville, Iowa versus some other place.  What brought your mother's side of the family to Centerville and when?
Speaker 2: It's the same thing that brought my father [Simon Estes] there, and we'll get to him, of course, later. But they had coal mines in Centerville, Iowa.  Iowa was a big coal mining town in the well, in the '20s [1920s] and the '30s [1930s] and believe it or not, it was a cosmopolitan international town.  We had people from Croatia, from Italy, from Czechoslovakia [Czech Republic and Slovakia], from Germany, from France, from England, from Sweden, all in Centerville, Iowa and, of course, African Americans, and again, I say, we were called colored in those days. But it was the coal mines that brought a lot of the people there and especially the African Americans.  So they had a lot coal in Iowa.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Is it a city or a town?
Speaker 2: It depends on what you call a city but when I was there, when, at the peak of the time, Center- probably about eight, nine thousand people.
Speaker 1: Well I guess I'm interested--so it was small then?
Speaker 2: It was a small, yeah, and that's what made it so interesting.  I think this diversity of people in the town this size was because of the coal mines.
Speaker 1: So, your mother's parents came there from where?
Speaker 2: I don't know exactly from where they came, her parents.  I know where my father's parents [Rachel Estes and Major Estes] came from, my mother, both of her parents, well, that's not true.  Both of her parents were from Iowa because my mother's mother was born in Knoxville, Iowa, I just remembered that, and her father, that I'm not sure, my grandfather, where he was born.  I'm quite sure he was also from Centerville, Iowa.
Story_ID: 323547
Speaker 1: Let's talk about your father.  Would you give me his name and where he was born and the year he was born?
Speaker 2: He was born April the 8th, nineteen--I mean, sorry, 1891.  His name was Simon, S-I-M-O-N, Estes, E-S-T-E-S [Simon Estes].  He was born, we think, in Virginia because that's where his father was, although he spent most of his life, before he came to Iowa, in Missouri, in Trenton, Missouri.  Now, my father could not read or write.  He's born in 1891.  His father, my grandfather, was a slave, sold for five hundred dollars.  I mention that because my father was taken out of, they call them readers, instead of classes in those days.  So they took him out of school and he was in the equivalent of the third reader, which we would call the third class, but, of course, it was an inferior school that only coloreds went to in Virginia
Speaker 1: Do you know what city of Virginia?
Speaker 2: I don't.  You know, that is the troub- I mean people have asked me and I have not been able to trace farther back.  It was in the Bible of my mother [Ruth Jeter Estes], the big family Bible, my father's father, my grandfather was born in the early eighteen si- late 1850s we feel because he remembered my father talk--they remembered having been freed when the Emancipation Proclamation was, I think it was 1863, was it not?
Speaker 1: So he was pretty young then, as a slave?
Speaker 2: He was young, yes, and as I say, you will see a picture, an original picture of him--
Speaker 1: Well, give me his name?  Give me your grandfather's--
Speaker 2: His name was Major, M-A-J-O-R [Major Estes], like the major in an arm- in the military, Estes, and his wife's name was Rachel [Rachel Estes], because I remember that 'cause sometimes I keep forgetting (unclear), and her name was Rachel, and they were married and, as I said, most of his life he spent in Trenton, Missouri and he came to Centerville, Iowa because of the coal mines and that's where he met my mother.  There was a nineteen-year difference between my mother, my father, and my father was a great man.
Story_ID: 323548
Speaker 1: I remember after he [Estes' father, Simon Estes] passed away in 1961, really due to a sociological problem which we call discrimination, in a certain hospital.  I was a student at the University of Iowa [Iowa City, Iowa], my mother [Ruth Jeter Estes] said, "Son come, son come to the hospital immediately, your father is very ill."  And I went there my dad was crying tears, "Ah, oh my stomach hurts."  I can still remember this.  He said, "My stomach hurts, please do something," and they had said that he had a heart problem.  My father had no history of heart problems at all.  So I went to a doctor who was looking after my father, and I stopped him in the corridor, I said, "I'm [HistoryMaker] Simon Estes, I'm a student at the University of Iowa, that's my father, very ill." I said, "My father, I wondered will you get a cardiologist to check my father."  He said, "A what?"  I said, "A cardiologist."  He said, "Where did you learn that word?  What is a cardiologist?"  Well, immediately the light bulbs went in, went on, I thought, uh oh, he's upset, 'cause I was in pre-med. So I wasn't trying to show off or anything, I was just trying to like talk in his language.  I said, "Well, why are you asking me that?"  I said, "Cardio, meaning vascular and logos, a Greek stem of the word meaning to study, to study the heart, a heart specialist."  I said, "But my father's not complaining about any pains in his thoracic area or his arm," I said, "He's, I think my," oh no it wasn't, I thought the speaker fell off.  What is that?  It is, is that?
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Yeah, put it on top of the mic.  Thanks.
Speaker 1: Is that okay?
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Yeah, mic's good.
Speaker 1: I don't have one.  Does it make any difference?
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  No.
Speaker 1: And so, he, he said, "Well I'm a doctor of internal medicine" and then "As you know, the heart's on the inside of the body so that's in my area."  He said, "He's an old man, he's probably going to die anyhow."  And I really sensed, he did not say this, but I sensed he wanted to say, "He's an old black man, it's time for him to die, anyhow" but he didn't put the word black or colored, he probably would've said colored, he's an old colored man, and I said, "Well you have to understand," I said, "My father is really crying out, he's asking me to help."  I said, "I love my father and so I'm representing my mother, my sisters [Patricia Estes, Erdyne Estes Whiteside, and Westella Estes]," or whatever else I said to him, I said, "So I just wanted to see if we could find out if it's not his heart. Will you check something else?" I said, "Because he's complaining of pains in his abdomen."  "Well, I'm doing all I can do for him.  If you want me to withdraw from the case, I will."  We had no money to pay.  He's in a hospital, he didn't have to pay.  I said, "Well I don't want you to withdraw."  My father died, it was either that same night or the next night.  We had an autopsy performed, he died of a ruptured appendix, and see that didn't have to be. But to let you know the faith of my mother and the way my father and mother both trained us, my mother said to me, "Son," she said, "even though that doctor might have been responsible for your father's premature death, you must not hate him, you must pray for him."
Story_ID: 323549
Speaker 1: I remember my mother [Ruth Jeter Estes] taught me as a kid, when I'd come home, the kids had called me a dirty black nigger. 'Cause look, I was born in '38 [1938], you know, there was a lot of, in Centerville, Iowa, no black or colored person were, in those days, they didn't have any prestigious jobs or anything like that.  So I'd come home say they called me a dirty black nigger or, you know, I had fights with white kids and my mother said, "Well now, son, don't you get, don't you hate those boys, you pray for them."  Now when you're young, growing up you think your mother's crazy, you know, these guys are beating me up and calling me some terrible names, she's telling me I have to love them but it was the greatest lesson that she taught me because hatred eats away at you, inside of you, and so she said, don't ever let that happen to you.  So when that doctor, who as far as I'm concerned, caused my father's [Simon Estes] premature death, premature death, my mother said, "Can't hate him, son, you've got to pray for him."
Story_ID: 323550
Speaker 1: My father [Simon Estes] was this peaceful man.  My, I asked, after my father died, years after my father died, I said, "Mother [Ruth Jeter Estes], did daddy ever yell at you?  I never heard him yell at you."  She said, "He never did."  My father never raised his voice at my mother or us children.  He was a very peaceful, a very quiet man.  Wonderful Christian father.
Speaker 2: What stories did he tell you about his growing up years?  Anything that stand out?
Speaker 1: He didn't talk a lot about it except the fact that there was a family called the Hutchinson family that, they called it a farm, but you and I know it was a plantation, he worked on the farm with the Hutchinsons.  Now, we also think our name Estes, we've, I've tried to look into it, it's either Spanish or French, many people say, that I've, 'cause I've traveled around the world and that's what more people categorize it.  As we both know, many times the, the slave workers took on the name of the masters so we don't know for sure if, which I wish I did know for sure, if it was Spanish, we were owned by, my [paternal] grandparents [Rachel Estes and Major Estes] were owned by Spanish or not.  Also on my father's side, my grandfather's side, they said there was one-fourth American Indian [Native American].  If you'll see photos of my father or, in which you'll see in the book, my grandparents, you can see this, but we don't know from, they probably came from the middle part of the United States.
Speaker 2: What was his specific role or job in the coal mines he worked in?
Speaker 1: Well, just lying on his back chopping the coal with a chopping, with a pick but he couldn't work in there very long because he had asthma and hay fever so he ended up working for a long time in a garage washing cars and scrubbing the floors and maintenance.  Then later on he worked at The Continental Hotel [Centerville, Iowa] carrying bags.  He'd go to work at seven in the morning and he had to clean the floor, et cetera, et cetera in Centerville, Iowa and then in the evenings he'd carry bags up, he had three stories and even an annex, so he had to carry bags a long ways and we lived basically off of the tips because his salary was eighteen dollars a week, I can remember that, eighteen dollars a week. But he would make enough tips, especially Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, those are big traveling sales days, which don't exist anymore today, but traveling salesmen came and he'd take them up to their room, and the average tip was fifteen cents, twenty cents if they carried three or four bags, that's all they got.  I remember once in a while my father said someone would give him a penny if he carried a bunch of bags and my father was such a peaceful--he said, "Ah, I'll just give it back to you," he said, "I'll give it back to you."  He just put it on a desk in the room said, "I think you need it worse than I do, that's okay," 'cause it was an insult, but he never, ever preached hatred or, or violence.  He was an incredibly, very quiet, soft-spoken, peaceful man.  He didn't smoke.  He did smoke until I was maybe eight, nine years of age and I asked my father, this is a long story, I'll make it short, anyhow, I asked him to stop smoking and he stopped smoking, he never smoked the rest of his life.  And when I got older, I realized what he did for me 'cause he couldn't buy toys and gifts and bicycles, we weren't like the other, you know, white kids.  I was the only black kid in my high school graduating class [from Centerville High School, Centerville, Iowa], only black student.  So, and the kids I associated with, you know, usually they were wealthy, white kids, et cetera but my father couldn't give me things and I realized as I got older, he gave something of himself.  That was good for him that he stopped smoking but in those days we didn't know that the danger of smoking, but he did.  He just stopped. And so for the last, and let's say I was, my father died in, in '61 [1961], '70s [1970s] I was twenty-three years of age so for the last eighteen years of my life or whatever it was, I don't remember, I have to calculate or, fifteen, my father never smoked.  He never smoked much anyhow but he did once in a while, but he stopped.

Speaker 1: How do you remember your home, the street that you lived on as a child and the neighborhood around?  What was that like?  Let's start with your home, your, your physical--
Speaker 2: The home, the first home, the house in which I was born, was 110 East Jackson Street in Centerville, Iowa.  It was a little small white house with--a very, very small house.  I can still remember the living room.  I remember a photographer having come and taking pictures of my sister [Erdyne Estes Whiteside] and me when I was two years of age and those little cameras where they pull the black thing over and he kept telling me to look at the little yellow birdie in there, and I was so frustrated because I thought, why's he telling me to look in there for that bird and why isn't that bird flying all around in here, and I couldn't find it, and I was so frustrated. And there's a picture that, I don't have one here but it's in my book ['Simon Estes: In His Own Voice,' Simon Estes and Mary L. Swanson] where I'm sitting on a piano bench, I can still remember, doing like that, I was trying to find that bird 'cause I've always tried, even today I'm a logic--I think I'm a logical person, I like to think I am, and so at that young age that didn't make sense to me that he was saying there was a bird in that camera but why wasn't it flying around the room. But it was a very small house, no running water, no central heating, of course not, we had a well, excuse me, no indoor toilet facilities and just a very, very small house. And we lived there until I was about four years of age and then we moved across the street from that house.  Then my father [Simon Estes] bought, it was a thousand five hundred dollars, or a thousand two hundred dollars he paid for that house. And it had four rooms downstairs and then my father made two bedrooms like almost out of an attic up there, but that also had no central heating.  I remember we finally--we had a coal stove that was in--like the dining room that had to heat the whole house.  So if you were in the dining room, you were cold and you only had one warm side of your body.  In the wintertime, in Centerville, when it was thirty [degrees] below zero, my mother [Ruth Jeter Estes] used to put rags under the doors 'cause the wind would blow through and in mornings when they had big snow there'd be ice on the inside of the rugs, that's how cold it was in that house.

Speaker 1: Centerville [Iowa] was what part of Iowa?  What big city was it near?  Just geographically, where are you located (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay. Well, I'm going to use Des Moines [Iowa] because it was eighty-five miles south and east of Des Moines.  We were eleven miles from the Missouri border.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We could, they say Southeastern Iowa, it's more like south-central-eastern Iowa.  So Des Moines is eighty-five miles away.  That's the closest way to finding it and it's close to the Missouri border.
Speaker 1: Tell me about the street and about your neighbors.  What was that ambience like?
Speaker 2: Believe it or not it was a mixed neighborhood but obviously very, very poor white people, and there, in my neighborhood, there were one, two, three colored families, four, four colored families and one, two, three, four, five, six within that little small area.  There's six, I say, white families but they were all poor.  Our next door neighbor, her name was Blanche [ph.], one of them, she was a white lady, it was one of my mother's [Ruth Jeter Estes] best friends. And we didn't have any major problems with our neighbors except for one and this was a real old man and his wife and they just, not only hated cutter people--colored people, they hated everybody.  They were mean people, I mean they poisoned my dog which really made me cry as a child but they were just kind of mean people.  Obviously, they didn't like us and they used to call us niggers all the time but my mother and father [Simon Estes] said, "They're old, just don't pay any attention."  They said, "Names can't hurt you."  They said, "Just don't pay any attention to it," so we let them do that but sometimes we, we'd probably hear what they did a little bit.  His name was Jim Wallen [ph.] and we'd said (singing), "Jimmy crack corn and I don't care," and then his wife's name was Mary [ph.], say, (singing) "Mary had a little lamb," and so then, you know, then they would really wipe us out, you know, but kids are kids (simultaneous).

Speaker 1: What were the occupations and jobs of the other adults in your neighborhood [in Centerville, Iowa]?  What, how did people support themselves (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, there was one man, I remember he was a barber.  His, he's the friend of my, the husband of my wife's best friend.  Everybody had menial jobs in that area where we lived, white or colored. They might be bagging groceries at a grocery store or working in coal mines, being custodians, et cetera.  There were no people that were even salesmen in a J.C. Penney's [J.C. Penney Company] or at a cash register, not at all, they just all had, always had menial jobs and especially the colored people.
Story_ID: 323554
Speaker 1: What is your earliest, farthest back memory of growing up in Centerville [Iowa]?  How far back can you remember?
Speaker 2: Well, I have to tell you, I still remember that photo I told you, photo session we had of my sister and me, Erdyne [Erdyne Estes Whiteside], and I have a photo which you will see in the autobiography ['Simon Estes: In His Own Voice,' Simon Estes and Mary L. Swanson], I can remember that.  I remember I had an aunt, her name was Theresa Lacard [ph.] who weighed over four hundred pounds and I saw her one time, I went into my mother's [Ruth Jeter Estes] bedroom, you know as a kid, and I was less than three years old, and she was so big and I came running out and I said to my mother, I said, "Mother, Mother, come look at the big fat mama, come look at the big fat mama," and my mother told that story for many years. I still remember that, but those are some of the best, probably the earliest I can remember. But I do remember things at around two years of age, which I know is rather unusual, but I did and do.
Story_ID: 323555
Speaker 1: How would you describe your family life as a child and, and an early teenager?  What was family life like for you?  What are some of the special family times or holidays, for example, that you remember?
Speaker 2: Well, the most important day of the week was Sunday because my father [Simon Estes] didn't work Sunday, he worked six days out, six days out of the week but on Sunday the whole family was together.  We went to church [at Second Baptist Church, Centerville, Iowa] two times, Sunday morning and Sunday night.  We always had enough food to eat on Sunday because my father got his eighteen dollar check on Saturday, and so mother [Ruth Jeter Estes] would go get groceries.  So we had a good meal and we ate well up through Wednesday, and from Wednesday until Saturday, it got thinner and thinner and tighter and tighter.
Story_ID: 323556
Speaker 1: It was about family life and you were saying that Sunday through Wednesday you had--
Speaker 2: Yeah, Sun- yeah, things were tight but what was, what I can remember about my family is that whether we realized it today, today or not, it was good that we didn't have any money, it was good that we were poor because we communicated with one another.  We would sit around and talk.  We never, we were not allowed to go to movies and they only had two movie theatres in Centerville [Iowa] and when I got a little older I'd sneak and go see cowboy movies with Roy Rogers and Gene Autry and all those guys when I was a kid but we were not allowed to go to movies, no dancing because, you know, we were a very, very strict Christian family.  So we sat around and we talked about anything and everything.  All we had in the house was a radio and we'd always listen to the news.  They used to have those old soapbox things on the radios in the afternoons and we would listen to those but mostly--and then at Christmastime, we were always together and we always worked a puzzle from the old year into the new year.  We'd all get around the table and mother [Ruth Jeter Estes] would buy a puzzle and my father [Simon Estes], where then we would book a puzzle.  Sundays, I said, was important in that the family was always together, and we did always eat all of our meals together which was very, very good. And I just remember having had a happy childhood.  I can actually and honestly say I have nothing negative to say about my mother and my father growing up.  I thought they were just, in quotes, perfect Christian loving mother and father that put their family first.  My father always put his family first.
Story_ID: 323557
Speaker 1: What do they think of you?
Speaker 2: Well, they're very proud.  My father [Simon Estes], unfortunately, died in '61 [1961], I started college in '56 [1956] so he was so proud when he knew that his son was going to college at the University of Iowa [Iowa City, Iowa].  That made him very happy and my mother [Ruth Jeter Estes], of course, was very proud for many more years. And I don't say that for any praise or glory for myself, but I'm happy that my mother was able to be proud. And when I won the Tchaikovsky Competition [International Tchaikovsky Competition] in Moscow [Russia] in 1966, President Johnson [President Lyndon Baines Johnson] invited me to sing at the White House [Washington, D.C.], invited my parents. So, of course, my father had passed away, my mother got to come and she came and that was one of the highlights of her life.  She was picked up at the airport there in D.C. [Washington, D.C.] and taken to the Mayflower Hotel, and went to the White House and had dinner and had her son sing, heard her son sing for the president of the United States (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What did they think--
Story_ID: 323558
Speaker 1: States (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) What did they [Estes' parents, Ruth Jeter Estes and Simon Estes] think of you as a child when you were growing up, though?  How did they--
Speaker 1: You know, I, I feel very blessed and that's why when I talk to young people today, I tell people, it's very important that children get a positive supporting input.  I've been the most either blessed, lucky, fortunate, whatever you want to say, my whole family, if I'm including cousins, I was the only one who in quotes made it, so to speak, but I had nothing but positive input.  Everybody always said, "That boy's going to be somebody some day," everybody said that to me. And I had a nickname, Billy, which I don't, you had something on there should have, my nickname was Billy 'cause when I was born, my mother wanted to name me after my father's side when my father wanted to name me William.  Obviously my mother won. But anyway, his name was Simon they decided well, we'll just call him Billy.  So all of my neighbors in Centerville [Iowa] they knew me as Billy. But they'd always say, "Billy, that, you're going to be something," and they used to say that I was going to be a preacher.  Many people said, they said, "That boy's going to be a preacher someday," 'cause see, back in those days, the only position that most African American men had was a, to be a minister, you know, so that carried a little prestige in the community. So they would use that a lot. And I had a high school superintendent, E.W. Fanning, I remember he invited me over his house, I might have been a junior in high school [Centerville High School, Centerville, Iowa]. And I thought, oh, what have I done now, the superintendent invited me to his house up at, um, I'm in deep trouble now, I didn't know what I'd done but I thought that's it.  I go over there and he said, "Simon [HistoryMaker Simon Estes], I just want to tell," and he was white, he said, "I want to tell you something."  He said, "You keep working hard in school," he said, "you're going to be someone someday."  I didn't know what he was talking about.  I said, "Okay, Mr. Fanning," and went on home but I had nothing but positive input and that's why I often say to parents today, don't degrade your children, don't put them down, give them encouragement, it worked for me.  I am who I am or what I am because of my mother and my father.
Story_ID: 323559
Speaker 1: What role did the church and religion play in your growing up years and, within your family?
Speaker 2: Integral, most important because, as you know too, whether they'd be negro spiritual songs written on hope, joy, sadness, et cetera, that all stemmed from the church. So that's why I said the church was an integral and religion was very important.  We went to church twice on Sunday and we--
Speaker 1: What church did you attend?
Speaker 2: Second Baptist Church [Centerville, Iowa] because the first church, the First Baptist [First Baptist Church, Centerville, Iowa] was a white church so we had to be Second Baptist in Centerville [Iowa].  Church was vitally important.  We prayed for every meal whether it was gravy and bread or mashed potatoes and chicken, we prayed and thanked the Lord for our meals, for our safety.  As I said, prayer was very, very important and religion in our family.
Story_ID: 323560
Speaker 1: So you attended the Second Baptist Church [Centerville, Iowa]--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --two times each Sunday?
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Twice in the day.  What were some of your memories of being in church on Sunday with your family at Second Baptist and who was the preacher and--
Speaker 2: Well, the preacher there I remember as a child, his name was Reverend Patton [ph.] and they were a very lively church 'cause the music was very, very important.  My mother [Ruth Jeter Estes] played the, the piano and conducted the church choir as well as sang solos and in fact, that the first public solo I ever sang was in Second Baptist Church, I was eight, nine years of age when I sang my first solo.
Speaker 1: What did you sing?
Speaker 2: 'Precious Lord, Take My Hand' and but church was very important and there was only one quotes colored church in Centerville [Iowa], as I said that time and it was, it was a very, very big day and church services lasted a long time I remember, it lasted a long time.  The minister used to spend about twenty minutes taking up the collection, you know.  Well we got ten dollars and thirty-three cents, they said, now I know the Lord has blessed some of you men out there, you can bring it up to fourteen dollars.  They'd get $14.25, now I know we can get fifteen you know, that'd go on forever and ever.  I remember that but the sermons were always very, very good and they were very, very fundamental, needless to say, and it was, I enjoyed church, actually I really did.
Speaker 1: What was the nature of the building?  Was it a--
Speaker 2: It was a very small building.  In fact, they just renovated it two years ago and I went back and sang for the opening and it's a landmark because it was the only colored church in Centerville, Iowa and they renovated it.  It's magnificent, it was a--
Speaker 1: So it's on the national register--historic places?
Speaker 2: It is now, absolutely, and it, the whole church is probably, well the people said about twice the size of this room that was it but when I was a kid, I thought it was a cathedral 'cause it looked so big but, you know, it had benches, et cetera.
Story_ID: 323561
Speaker 1: Do you have other memories of, of growing up in Centerville [Iowa]?  I want to get to your elementary schooling but just other memories of growing up.
Speaker 2: Well, what I remember, I loved school from kindergarten on through, I enjoyed school very much.  I didn't even want to get sick because I didn't want to miss school.  I enjoyed being happy.  I enjoyed making my friends laugh or make them feel happy, you know, kids and things like that.  I had a neighbor boy who was colored named Floyd Brooks [ph.], we used to go hunting but, you know, hunting was, that's more of a word that actually, although Floyd, we'd call him Flu Flu Flee, but Floyd did actually hunt but I never shot an animal at all, squirrel or a rabbit or things like that and I didn't really like to fish.  I think I went fishing one time in my life and it just was not my interest. But my childhood days were like normal kids'.  We'd play outside.  We played softball, basketball and that sort of thing and the neighbor kids would get together and we would play hide-n-seek and, and we had tires.  We would roll tires down and we couldn't swim in the swimming pool as colored kids until much later in my life because they wouldn't allow coloreds in swimming pools, with the white children, but later on that, that got corrected. But it was just a normal childhood of playing games, reading Bible with my mother [Ruth Jeter Estes], obviously going to church [Second Baptist Church, Centerville, Iowa] on Sunday and later going to school.  It was a happy time.
Story_ID: 323562
Speaker 1: I want you to take me through grade one to grade twelve but let me ask you a question before you do that.  At age nine, ten, eleven, did you have any notion or inclinations about what you wanted to do as an adult, what you wanted to be?  Any thoughts?
Speaker 2: You know I couldn't say I really did.  I enjoyed singing but at that point I never thought of maybe having singing as a career and especially not opera, you know. But I, it didn't, I just was interested in getting a good education and my mother [Ruth Jeter Estes] and my father [Simon Estes] stressing the importance, they said, "You've got to get an education, that's something that nobody can take away from you."  You, we all, we all use that phrase.  So I didn't think about having any singing until probably my sophomore or junior year in high school [Centerville High School, Centerville, Iowa] but not opera.
Story_ID: 323563
Speaker 1: Let's go to grade one, elementary school.  What do you remember about the beginning of your formal schooling, of what elementary school did you attend?  What was it like there as you remember?
Speaker 2: The elementary school, and that also started with kindergarten there, my kindergarten teacher's name was Mrs. King [ph.] and my first grade teacher her name was Elizabeth, no Ethel Denoon, well there were two sisters in the, Mrs., Miss, Miss Denoon 'cause in those days none of the female teachers were married except for one.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: Did you know years ago, in certain parts of the United States, a woman could not be married if she was a school teacher?
Speaker 1: Well, that was true when I was growing up.
Speaker 2: Really, okay, then you're, I, we're about--
Speaker 1: And it was true, yeah, I was born in '37 [1937].
Speaker 2: I was, okay, we're the same thing.  So--
Speaker 1: I had one teacher who was married, right, but she lived in Boston [Massachusetts] and she commuted.  I understand they said she commuted every day--
Speaker 2: No kidding.
Speaker 1: --and in those days, from Boston to New Bedford [Massachusetts], it was two and a half, three hours--
Speaker 2: Wow.
Speaker 1: --but they said she got away with it.
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: She wasn't in the community, but they said she was married, she was up here, so nobody knew.
Speaker 2: Isn't that amazing that, that was true.  They were not allowed to be married.
Speaker 1: By the way, she's the only one whose name I can't remember.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's okay.
Speaker 1: You've got a good memory.  Go ahead.
Speaker 2: But, we, well I think I can probably remember almost all my teachers but I enjoyed school very, very much and there was discrimination in the schools which I remember it bothered me as a child but I never got bitter--
Story_ID: 323564
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)
Speaker 2: What was the nature of the discrimination?
Speaker 1: Well, the teachers, for example, we had patrolmen, they'd wear these little uniforms in those days and they'd stop the traffic and let kids come, let the kids cross the street and you'd get to do that two weeks at a time or a week at a time, I can't remember for sure. And I always raised my hand but they never choose one colored kid.  You could never, we could never have any positions of responsibility, they would never assign that and there was discrimination in the grading system.  The only time they would halfway be somewhat equal or fair to us was in music or sports but see if it was sports, and I was one of the fastest kids in my high school [Centerville High School, Centerville, Iowa], wait a minute, yeah, in my high school, but there was another high school later on, no, that was elementary, junior high school, there was a guy that was faster than I was. But in sports, if you could run faster, then they couldn't deny you that, you know, whether you're a white or black, if you cross the line first, you won. But if it was left up to human opinion or decisions, then there was always discrimination.  And as I said too, blacks couldn't be in any plays.  My oldest sister [Patricia Estes], I mean her having come up from high school, I must have been in junior high or elementary school, in tears and I guess she wanted to be in a play.  The teacher said, "Colored people can't act," said, "so you can't be in the play," said, "but next year we might do a play that has a servant, a maid," and said, "then you would work for that."  So there was discrimination in the schools, but it wasn't, you know, like the, the lynchings that were going on in the South.  Okay, you didn't date white girls, you didn't, there were a lot of things you simply couldn't do.  The only activities you could really be in sports, you couldn't be on the debate team or anything of, that just didn't happen. But the teachers were, were somewhat firm.  There were Mrs. Bartle [ph.], was my third grade teacher and, and Mrs. Carter [ph.] was a second grade teacher.  I always felt they were quite fair, but some of the other teachers, there was a little bit of discrimination there. And the one lady that was married, she was my fourth grade teacher, Mrs. Bend [ph.], that was her name, I don't know how she pulled it off, but she was married and she would let kids go buy her donuts once in a while, but she wouldn't still let a colored kid go buy donuts for her at the bakery. But, you know, she shouldn't have been doing it anyhow, but, you know.  So, we were restricted and grades, they couldn't mess up your grades if it was multiple choice, if you got it right, you got it right, but if you'd write a paper, then you would see the discrimination.  Sometimes that wasn't only just against colored, that was against poor white kids too.  It's the rich white kids got all the parts, all the favoritism, they were always the teacher's pet, et cetera but none of the poor white kids or colored kids were never.
Story_ID: 323565
Speaker 1: Were you in a K [kindergarten]-eight elementary or did you have a middle school transition grades (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) We had kin- no, yeah, we had kindergarten through sixth grade and then seventh and eighth grade were, were called junior high school and then ninth through twelfth were as high school.
Speaker 1: Any special memories of the junior high school years?
Speaker 2: Mr. Hoover [ph.] was the principal of the school and I remember I liked him and a teacher named Mrs. Lofgren [ph.].  She was a lovely teacher and that's when I started sing--okay I sang in elementary school too, I was a boy soprano. But in junior high school, because I didn't realize that I had an exceptional voice, but the high school teacher named Don Gunderson heard about me in junior high school and they had never done that before but he brought me over just for choir rehearsal to sing with the high school choir when I was in junior high school because of my singing voice.  And so I remember that and I remember Mr. Hoover because he was a nice man.
Story_ID: 323566
Speaker 1: So you did some solo performances in junior high school?
Speaker 2: In junior high school, yes, with the junior high school choir was a high school choir.
Speaker 1: And what kind of things were you singing at that age?
Speaker 2: Well, it would just be, you know, songs that had some sort of religious connotation toward, or songs from Broadway musicals in high school [Centerville High School, Centerville, Iowa].  Just your typical high school music repertoire is what we sang.
Speaker 1: Did you have any training of voice or music outside of school?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: You didn't?
Speaker 2: I didn't have any at all until this teacher [Charles Kellis] discovered me at the University of Iowa [Iowa City, Iowa] back in 1963.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I just had a God-given natural voice.
Story_ID: 323567
Speaker 1: Tell me about your high school years.  What high school did you attend?
Speaker 2: Centerville High School [Centerville, Iowa] and I enjoyed it.  It was a wonderful time.  There was still discrimination there but I played basketball and football and track. I was skinny as a rail, I remember, and I played baseball and I sang in the quartet, the quintet, did solo work and I did well academically.  I was not a four point student and some of that might have been because of the lack of fairness in the grading system in those days but certainly I passed every grade and I was always advanced and I enjoyed it.  There were two people, the superintendent of the school, E.W. Fanning, the one I told you about that called me over to his house and said you're going to be something, someone, someday and Bill Jerome who was a health teacher in the high school and one of the coaches--and Bill Jerome, I never felt any discrimination from them.  Of course, again, I said I was the only African American in my class, colored in those days, so I had no dates in high school.  I didn't have my first date until my second year at University of Iowa [Iowa City, Iowa] and, but they were happy days.
Story_ID: 323568
Speaker 1: There was discrimination, I remember, I couldn't, we couldn't sit downstairs with the white people in the movie theatre and I ran home all my friends obviously were white.  So we went to a movie one night and I bought my ticket, I started going upstairs, they said, "Hey Sy [HistoryMaker Simon Estes], where you going?"  I said, "I'm going to sit upstairs."  "Sit with us."  I said, "Colored people can't sit downstairs."  They were not even aware of it.  They said, "Come on."  I said, "No I can't."  "Come on, you're with us."  So I started going down then this man's name was Mr. Johnson, he was the manager of the movie theatre, he said, "Hey Estes, where do you think you're going?"  Before I had a chance to say anything, my friends said, "He's sitting with us."  He said, "Colored people can't sit downstairs."  And this is very interesting 'cause these kids weren't thinking about it and they're--one's father was a doctor and another was a lawyer and another owned a shoe shop, shoe store and I remember when someone said, "He's sitting with us, if not I'll tell my old man, he'll come down and he'll close your movie theatre up," 'cause their fathers were important people.  And I remember I came out afterwards, 'cause they always had us sitting up in a, in a little small balcony the size of that piano almost, next to the toilets so it stank up and you couldn't see the movie screen very well and I sat down there, saw that movie, it was a cowboy movie, as I remember, and I thought, wow, it doesn't stink down here.
Speaker 2: How did you think about and, and rationalize or explain to yourself, if you did, the segregation--
Speaker 1: I was aware--
Speaker 2: --'cause I, because I'm surprised to hear that this was a condition in Iowa, you know.
Speaker 1: Oh, you know--
Speaker 2: I mean the South I know about--
Speaker 1: Yes, but you know what, this is where people don't realize, in those days, and we're about the same age, as we both have stated, there was discrimination everywhere.  They didn't do as many lynchings up here as they did in the South and East and our, our actual life wasn't in danger but I could tell you, hear stories all day, discrimination against colored people in Centerville, Iowa in terms of employment or, not, we couldn't swim in the swimming pool as I told you and then finally, this is during my high school years, they would let us swim but we could only swim on Saturday mornings from nine until eleven and then after we got out of the water, they put more disinfectant in it because, you know, we carried germs.  My parents [Ruth Jeter Estes and Simon Estes] were the ones that explained to me the importance of never being bitter but on the other hand, being aware, being realistic, not trusting up to a point, you trust up to a point but then beware.  I really have to attribute my parents to keeping me from never hating.  I don't think it was in me anyhow, to be quite frank, I've never been a hating type person.  I was aware, I would come home, as I told you, sometimes crying to my mother saying how they did this to me or said this to me and called me this or whatever and my mother would just say you have to pray to the Lord for strength and that the Lord will help those children, or their parents but--'cause there was a tremendous amount, I mean, you have no, we couldn't play on the golf course, we couldn't do anything in Centerville, Iowa.
Speaker 2: Although, you know, I arrived here in 1955 as a freshman, it was only three years before that, 1952, that quote, colored students were allowed to live in the Boston University [Boston, Massachusetts] dormitories.
Speaker 1: I believe it because when I went to the University of Iowa [Iowa City, Iowa] in 1957, blacks and whites couldn't share a dormitory room either and people don't want to believe that and that's in our lifetime.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and when I was at BU [Boston University] in '55 [1955] to '59 [1959], and there were brothers at Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts], they put them all in the same wing of the same house so they segregated them at Harvard in the mid-'50s [1950s] just, you know, I'm just relating the experience.
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, no, but that's interesting because we had the same thing out there.  It's incredible.
Story_ID: 323569
Speaker 1: What was your favorite subject in high school [Centerville High School, Centerville, Iowa]?  Did you have one that you really liked, you know, what?
Speaker 2: Very interesting.  That's a question nobody ever asked me, but I enjoyed, we had courses like what we'd call sociology today, health, I liked that.  I enjoyed--obviously, I did enjoy music, I enjoyed, I think, geography.  I liked geography very, very much and I took two years of typing which I enjoyed.  I (background noise) enjoyed history.
Speaker 1: You were saying you enjoyed geography and that you liked typing--
Speaker 2: Geography, I liked history, I, I didn't really like art, like painting that type of art.  I enjoyed music.  Obviously, I enjoyed the sports.  I enjoyed the choir, anything related to music I enjoyed and health class, I remember I enjoyed very much.  I didn't, biology was okay, but it wasn't one of my favorite subjects.

Speaker 1: You graduated from Centerville High School [Centerville, Iowa] in what year?
Speaker 2: Nineteen fifty-six [1956].
Speaker 1: And what was the next step?  Where did you go from there?
Speaker 2: I, Centerville had a, what we called junior college, a community college, a two-year college, you know.  I went there for one year, in '56 [1956] and then '57 [1957], 1957, I transferred to the University of Iowa [Iowa City, Iowa].
Speaker 1: And did you go as a pre-med student?
Speaker 2: Yes, I went as a pre-med student.
Speaker 1: Well tell me how you arrived at that at that point in time?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, I, my first year in Centerville Junior College [Centerville Campus of Indian Hills Community College, Centerville, Iowa], I was thinking maybe, I didn't know if I wanted to be in music or not but my voice changed my senior year in high school.  As I told you, I sang first soprano and my voice changed and, because I remember I asked my high school teacher, Don Gunderson was the music teacher, and I asked him one time we were going to a state competition, I said, "Do you think I can ever make a living as a singer?"  He said, "Absolutely, you could Simon [HistoryMaker Simon Estes]," and I wasn't thinking about opera, I was thinking like, you know, like Nat King Cole, (singing) 'When I Fall in Love,' this type of music, popular music.  He said, "No, you could really be a singer someday."  And so, because my voice, it changed, and when it changed I just couldn't sing for like a year or two.  I'd always wanted to do something to help people so I decided I want to be a doctor.  So I went to the University of Iowa and took pre-med courses.  And then I changed, I was a professional student.  So I changed my major and I liked theology.  I took a course in theology and then I was interested in social psychology.  I had a very difficult time financially because I had no money, my parents [Ruth Jeter Estes and Simon Estes], rather had no money so I worked full-time all the years I was in college.  I was at the University of Iowa for six years because I kept changing my major.  So, as I said, I was interested in social psychology, pre-med and theology, but ended up getting my degree in music at the University of Iowa (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Can I go back?  Did the interest at being a doctor have anything to do with the experience that you had with your father in the hospital?  Did that have any--
Speaker 2: Not really 'cause see my father died in '61 [1961]--
Speaker 1: Oh, that's right, that's right--
Speaker 2: --and as I was already in college, no, but I see why you'd ask that, no, because I had another friend whose father died and he wanted to be a doctor and that's a very logical thing quite often, yeah.
Speaker 1: So you got your degree in what subject then?
Speaker 2: Music.
Speaker 1: In music.
Speaker 2: Ended up getting my degree in music at the University of Iowa.
Speaker 1: So, pre-med to theology, history, psychology and then--
Speaker 2: Music.
Speaker 1: --it was music.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: It was a bachelor of arts degree--
Speaker 2: Yes, that's right.
Speaker 1: --in music?
Speaker 2: And I have a doctorate from Luther College [Decorah, Iowa].  I'm going to have several honorary doctorates and special acknowledgments like from the medical--College of Medicine [University of Iowa Roy J. and Lucille A. Carver College of Medicine, Iowa City, Iowa].  They presented me the special award because of my dedication at that time to youth and education and health but that was after I was a professional singer.

Speaker 1: At the University of Iowa [Iowa City, Iowa], there was a singing group called The Old Gold Singers.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: You were a part of that?
Speaker 2: I was the first--
Speaker 1: Tell me that, tell me about that.
Speaker 2: I was the first African--well we were black at in those days, I think, with a little b and then we became Black with a capital B--
Speaker 1: Capital only, Black, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, we're Black at those, I was the first black to be in the Old Gold Singers and when I auditioned for it, the, the director of the group, Gerald Lawson was his name, he really liked my voice and I didn't know this until later.  He went to the rehearsal and he said, "You know, I've heard this guy that I'd love to have in the group, he, but he's black," and he himself told me what the kids said later, and he said, they said, "Can he sing?"  These were all white students.  He said, "Oh yeah, he has a wonderful voice."  "So if that's all, if he can sing, let him in the group."  But he was afraid the students wouldn't want me in the group and I ended up being, I don't say this boastfully, I say it with humility and gratitude, another singer Mary Sue Grover [ph.] was her name, a white girl, she and I ended up being the two main soloists of the whole group. And it was a group of like twenty-two singers.
Speaker 1: Twenty-two.
Speaker 2: Mixed boys and girls, yeah.
Story_ID: 323572
Speaker 1: Just staying with formal education, did you go on to get a doctorate, did you say?
Speaker 2: I have a doctorate from Luther College [Decorah, Iowa] and then I have one, I think five or six, honorary doctorates.  Siena College [Loudonville, New York] of New York, Lawrence University [Appleton, Wisconsin], Iowa State University [Ames, Iowa], Drake University [Des Moines, Iowa], Tulsa University--University of Tulsa [Tulsa, Oklahoma], those are honorary doctorates.
Speaker 1: Did you go to the Juilliard School of Music [The Juilliard School, New York, New York] directly following your graduation from the University of Iowa [Iowa City, Iowa]?
Speaker 2: I went to Juilliard School of Music directly from the University of Iowa for one year, started the second year and followed a girlfriend to Germany and, God, I won't bore you with the whole story, but anyhow, I auditioned. I wanted to see her at Christmastime and I didn't have any money and I got a grant from the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] and New York City trust fund to go over there and audition, and they offered me a contract but I was still in Juilliard and they offered me a contract to sing their role of Amonasro in the opera 'Aida' [Giuseppe Verdi], which is with Leontyne Price, you'll see that picture right there later. But anyhow, so I came back to Juilliard and I said, you know, they've offered me a job at the Deutsche Oper [Deutsche Oper Berlin, Berlin, Germany], Deutsche meaning German, Opera House in, in West Berlin as it was at that time. And they said to sing the role of the king in 'Aida' but I ended up having to do Ramfis, that's another long story, but anyhow, I went back to Juilliard, I said, Juilliard, I said, I've got a chance to start singing a career.  They said, "Well, you can never have a career without Juilliard, don't accept it, turn it down."  Well something in here and here said, "Take it," and I took it and I made my debut in opera in 1965, April 19th, 1965 at the Deutsche Oper in West Berlin.
Story_ID: 323573
Speaker 1: Nineteen sixty-five [1965], West Berlin, Germany, 1966, Moscow [Russia], tell me about what happened in '66 [1966]?
Speaker 2: Well, I was, I was singing in that opera house [Deutsche Oper Berlin] in Germany, in Berlin, and also in Lubeck, Germany and I came back to the states for something and the state department [U.S. Department of State] heard about my having won third prize in the Munich [Germany] international competition [ARD International Music Competition] in 1965, and that I was singing in an opera house in Germany. And to this day I don't know how they knew and yet they invited me down, and I went down and spoke to some people in New York City and they said, this is the first year they're having the Tchaikovsky Competition [International Tchaikovsky Competition] open to singers, vocalists, we would like to send you there, the state department, and represent the United States.  I was honored and they, I said, "But what are the requirements?" Well you had to sing a certain number of songs in Russian, I said, "I don't know any Russian."  They said, "We'll send you some money, you can study Russian." And I went back to Germany, at the opera house [Theater Lubeck] in Lubeck where I was singing at that time, the money never arrived.  It was something told me to go, kind of like, something said for me to, that other situation I told you about.  And so, I, I went ahead and went.  I flew from East Berlin [Germany] to Moscow with Aeroflot, this horrible Russian airline, and a lady sitting next to me was a German, it was a Russian movie actress who spoke German and I spoke a little German at that time so she asked why I was going, I told her.  I said, "Could you tell me a song that is a very famous Tchai- song by Tchaikovsky [Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky] that I could sing," and she taught it to me, she said, "Yes, 'Ni slova, O drug moy,' which means 'Not a word, O my friend.'"  And so I learned that song phonetically, from East Berlin to Moscow because the first round of competition you've got to sing one, you only had to sing one song in Russian. And I sang something in Italian and English, or whatever.  So, the first round, I was thrilled, I was, advanced to the second round and they only have three rounds, of course.  And so my accompanist's name, her name was Irina Zorina [ph.], I will never forget that, she said, in her broken English, "What sing you the second round of Russian" 'cause you know the Russian, the second round you do three songs in Russian, I said, "Ah, ah, ah, that's, I don't know anything."  Well, she almost had a heart attack.  "No, you must study hard."  To make a long story short, in two days I memorized, it was four songs in Russian and, but in one of the arias from the opera 'Eugene Onegin' [Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky] I forgot a big section of it so I forget, I was finished.  Well, because I didn't fall apart, 'cause George London was on the jury, he was one of our great opera baritones in the United States, he has since died, he told me back in America when I came back, because I didn't fall apart because I left out a big section of a big Russian aria from, they advanced me to the finals and they, I ended up winning the, the third prize and the third prize was enough that I got invited to the White House [Washington, D.C.] to sing for President Johnson [President Lyndon Baines Johnson] and that helped catapult my career and then that year I would sing in the Hollywood Bowl [Los Angeles, California] singing Tanglewood [Lenox, Massachusetts] with Erich Leinsdorf that same year and just, my career just took off then. And since then, you know, I've sang in every major opera house in the world.
Story_ID: 323574
Speaker 1: Well, I'll come back and trace some of that but when did you start to teach?
Speaker 2: I started teach--well, I, I taught at Juilliard [The Juilliard School, New York, New York] almost twenty years ago.  They'd really been asking me many, many times, would I please come and teach.  I said, "I'm so busy singing," they said, "That's okay, whenever you can come, come." And at that time they had no African Americans on their faculty.  So, I went and I taught there for one year, but then I just, I just really didn't have time.  I mean, maybe I was there four weeks out of the whole year 'cause I sing all over the world.  And so, that was over twenty years ago.  So, that was the first time I started teaching.  Then I didn't teach anymore, except privately I'd work with some student, if people come, would you just work with me, so I would do that but not very often because I was busy singing.  And then I started really teaching more consistently at Iowa State University [Ames, Iowa] six years ago and teaching voice and they'd also have me do lectures in humanities.  Then three years ago, they asked me to come to the Wartburg College [Waverly, Iowa], a private college in Iowa, teaching opera, voice, diction, Germ- languages, German, Italian, Russian, French and, and then Wartburg College because it's a kind of a, not a religious school but it's founded on the Lutheran faith, like this Boston University [Boston, Massachusetts] is Methodist.  They had me leading chapel services also and whenever I do that, it makes me think, well, of some of those people, who said, "That boy's going to be a minister someday," so I'm preaching up in the chapel, too. But they used me in the schools of theology and sociology to do, but lectures on, I do lectures in many things.  In Europe, I spoke at international bankers conventions in Zurich, Switzerland, bankers from all over the world because I've been a lot, all that sort of singing all over the world and they know that my interest is not only music, it's in humanity and human beings and all sorts of things, so, I teach many different things at these universities.
Story_ID: 323575
Speaker 1: In looking over the scant amount of background material that I received on your career and your work, they kept stressing your international reputation as opposed to a national reputation being better known here in, in the United States.  Is that true and can you elaborate on that?
Speaker 2: Well, the reason I went to Europe, 'cause I said first it was really following a girlfriend, but my career, I don't think would ever have taken off the way it did had I not, had I not gone to Europe and started in Berlin [Germany] at the Deutsche Oper [Deutsche Oper Berlin]. that's the, you know, the top houses are Berlin, Hamburg [Germany] and Munich, Germany, can't start higher than that and there were a lot of discriminations in the United States.  They wouldn't let me sing in opera houses and certainly not leading roles although it was almost like a paradox because I did sing with the San Francisco Opera, did 'The Tales of Hoffmann' [Jacques Offenbach] out there in 1968 and I also sang out there early with Luciano Pavarotti in the opera 'La Boheme' [Giacomo Puccini].  Many opera houses in the United States would not engage me because of my skin color, and that has happened sometimes in other places in Europe, but not as much as here, I'm sorry to say that.  I was more accepted in Europe on my talent than on my skin color. And many people would say I was too tall, I was too short, my voice was too big, my voice was too beautiful, there's all these excuses, and I remember one man who owned a, directed an opera house in the United States, he told me the truth, he said, "Simon [HistoryMaker Simon Estes], I would like to engage you in my opera house, but you know we get money from sponsors, et cetera, et cetera and they said if I engaged you, they would not give monies so I can't use you."  So, more of my, most of my singing was in Europe.  I sang every year in the United States but most of it was in Europe and that's, was all over Europe in all the major opera houses.
Story_ID: 323576
Speaker 1: Tell me about some of your most memorable performances in Europe.  What are some of the big things that, that you've done over and over again perhaps in countries?
Speaker 2: Well, I'm, I'm known the most as being a Wagnerian, Verdi [Giuseppe Verdi] singer and I went to Bayreuth [Germany] to sing in 1978, the title role of 'The Flying Dutchman' [Richard Wagner].  No black man had ever sung on the stage in Bayreuth.  That's called the mecca of Wagner, Richard, Richard Wagner's, as we say, but Richard Wagner's music. And they said too, because not only was I, I had, I went and auditioned and the same day audition, Wolfgang Wagner, who's a grandson of Richard Wagner, hired me that very same day.  Can you imagine the chance he took and they wrote in newspapers they're going to boo that black man off the stage if he comes and sings in Bayreuth on this sacred stage in Germany, but I went there and I was very blessed.  In 1978, I had a huge success and nobody booed me and from that point on my career really did take off and I sang the role of 'The Flying Dutchman' probably more than any of my other roles I've ever sung, but that is very memorable.  Another memorable experience was when I sang at the Nobel Prize committee in 19--I think '90 [1990] or '91 [1991], the same year that Nelson Mandela got out of prison, and they had a conference there, the Elie Wiesel Foundation [Elie Wiesel Foundation for Humanity], and in cooperation and collaboration with the Nobel Prize committee on the anatomy of hate, why do we have hate in the world now.  I was asked to go there and sing and that was the first time I met Nelson Mandela and I sang with, on the same program where Gregory Peck and Audrey Hepburn were on it but that was a wonderful experience even though it was a non-paying date because they let me sit in on all the conferences with these great people from fifty-two different countries, doctors, poets, writers, musicians, Jimmy, president Jimmy Carter [President James Earl "Jimmy" Carter, Jr.] was there, Mitterrand [Francois Mitterrand] was there, the president of France, Havel [Vaclav Havel] was there, these people from all over the world were there and that was one of my memorable experiences.  Other memorable experiences when I sang, I've sung for, as I told you, four presidents of the United States, both parties.  I've sung for the Pope [Saint Pope John Paul II] who just died recently.  I sang twice at the Vatican for him even though I'm not Catholic.  Having sung for Nelson Mandela was one of my greatest experiences in my life.  Having sung in Desmond Tutu's cathedral, Archbishop Desmond Tutu in Cape Town [South Africa], that was memorable.  Made another big break, I was the first black man ever to sing on the stage in Cape Town, South Africa, in South Africa, period, in the opera after apartheid.  I was asked to go during the apartheid years but I wouldn't, I refused to go even though they offered me a ton of money, which I didn't have any money in those days but I still said no because of apartheid.  And then when I went there and sang for the first time, about nine years ago, I did the title role of 'Nabucco' by Verdi.  The next year I did Porgy in 'Porgy and Bess' [George Gershwin] and that's how I came across my school that I eventually founded there in South Africa but that was another big event in having sung in South Africa. And I was a groundbreaker in many roles that I sang where black men had never been allowed to sing around certain stages so there's just lots of those things.
Story_ID: 323577
Speaker 1: You were married to Ovida [Ovida Strong]?
Speaker 2: Ovida, yeah.
Speaker 1: Ovida.
Speaker 2: But that's interesting because all over Europe they say Ovida, but it's O-V-I-D-A, but in the United States, they say Ovida.
Speaker 1: Ovida.
Speaker 2: But in Europe it's always Ovida.
Speaker 1: Okay, when did you meet her?
Speaker 2: I met her--
Speaker 1: When did you, how did you, when did you get married?
Speaker 2: I, well she is my second marriage.  I was married to my daughters' mother [Yvonne Baer] in 1980 and then unfortunately we got a divorce about nine years ago which broke my heart but it happened.  She wanted a divorce.  She was nineteen years younger than I, a little young, but we're the best of friends now and she happens to adore my present wife. But I met Ovida through my mother [Ruth Jeter Estes] because Ovida's a registered nurse, and she'd been taking care of my mother. And about six years ago, yeah six years ago, I just happened to be in Iowa singing and I was at my mother's house and Ovida came to give my mother her check-up, you know, and listen to her heart and blood pressure, et cetera, and I was there and that's where I met her.  I remember after she left, I said to my mother, I said, "That's a really lovely lady."  My mother said, "I just love her, son."  And so I didn't see her for another six months, but she would correspond with me with faxes in Europe letting me know about my mother's health and her condition.  And then I came back and I was singing--I sang a performance and she was there, and then I invited her to a lunch and, but at my I already knew--my mother--she was a fine Christian lady and that meant a lot to me.  My first wife was Jewish and she was a fine Christian lady and that really meant a lot to me that she was Christian and so we started courting, I knew her for over a year and we feel that God brought us together.  We have a very beautiful marriage and my three daughters just--
Speaker 1: Well, how many daughters do you have?
Speaker 2: I have three.  This is Jennifer [Jennifer Estes], she's the oldest.  In fact, I've got to turn my phone on at 4:30 because she--either she's going to call me or my youngest daughter, Tiffany [Tiffany Estes], 'cause she heard, she's an ice skater, you know, ice skating, and her team, synchronize ice skating, she, her team won the Swiss championships a week ago and she just skated this last Saturday, Sunday--
Speaker 1: This is your first wife's daughter now?
Speaker 2: Fir- yeah, these are all the daughters by my first wife.
Speaker 1: They are, okay.
Speaker 2: And so Jennifer's the oldest and Lynne [Lynne Estes] is--
Speaker 1: Well, when was Jennifer born?
Speaker 2: Jennifer's born in 1983.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Jennifer like the normal spelling.  Lynne, spelled L-Y-N-N-E, with an E at the end, she was born in '85 [1985] and she's at her first year here at Boston University [Boston, Massachusetts].
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: And Tiffany's eighteen.
Speaker 1: Okay, thanks.
Speaker 2: And I love my daughters.  They're wonderful, wonderful young ladies.
Speaker 1: That's great.
Speaker 2: I feel very blessed.
Story_ID: 323578
Speaker 1: Well, you mentioned a school that you started in South Africa.  Let me, let's say a little bit about your interest in young people in youth and some of the foundations you've established.  Well let me start with the school in South Africa.  Tell me the name of the school and how you happened to found it and what's the status of it today.
Speaker 2: Okay, it's called the Simon Estes Music High School [Cape Town, South Africa] and they named it after me, which I didn't ask them to do, nor did I want them to do, but when I went there to sing with the opera company for the first time, 'Nabucco' [Giuseppe Verdi], as I told you, and I got off the airport in Cape Town [South Africa], there was this choir in the terminal singing, beautiful choir, it looked like high school kids, which they were, and I just thought, that's nice, they have a choir welcoming people, you know.  I never heard of that before in my life.  I've been flying all around the world.  Well, I heard my name, they were singing in Xhosa, which is the language of the blacks there in South Africa in one of the areas, and so someone came and interpreted to me they said, they were singing, "[HistoryMaker] Simon Estes, welcome home, we love you," and I'd never been to Africa before.  That touched me so much in their own, for the first time in my life, I felt that I understood my roots, that I was American and African but they just said that, "Simon Estes, welcome home, we love you."  So the next day I said, from where do they come?  They said a school in Gcaleka [ph.], which is a suburb of Cape Town.  I went up to see it, a high school, there were 4,500 students with the worst conditions you could imagine.  And I'll make the story very long, they had not even a piano or anything.  So I went, I bought them a new piano that very same day and had to teach them how to take care of it 'cause they didn't know, you know.  And I came back to the states and went to Iowa and I was singing in a little town called Gowrie [Iowa] and I told these high school kids what, that, what I had experienced in South Africa and a little girl named Jessica Grell who's now going to Iowa State University [Ames, Iowa]--
Speaker 1: The last name again.
Speaker 2: Jessica Grell, G-R-E-L-L, you'll see her picture in the book ['Simon Estes: In His Own Voice,' Simon Estes and Mary L. Swanson].
Speaker 1: Thank you, okay.
Speaker 2: I said they're doing, she gave, brought her clarinet, said, take my clarinet and give it to Africa, your kids, some kids in Africa, that wasn't the name of my school at that point and then within twenty-four hours, I collected fifty-two instruments.  The word spread around Iowa.  We collected books.  My daughters [Jennifer Estes, Lynne Estes and Tiffany Estes] collected books, clothing, had a semi-trailer truck, threw the stuff, threw, with instruments, clothing, books to take to the school in Gcaleka.  This was all sent there because I had a connection with Swiss Air [Swiss International Air Lines], I was a, I'm a VI Person, VIP person with Swiss Air.  They flew all of that stuff from New York [New York], UPS [United Parcel Service] drove it from Iowa to New York, free of charge, 'cause they knew what the cause was.  Swiss Air flew it all the way to South Africa for 12 percent of the freight price and I realized I couldn't help four 4,500 students are going to go broke so I decided that, I talked to the head of the school, I said, could we start a private school?  They said, yes.  So I bought a house.  Very few people know this.  I paid for a house myself that, we had eighty-five students there.  I had to put in toilets and everything else because of boys and girls.  And then, that was the first year and the school did so well, the board of education, they inspect schools, my school was the only school there wasn't anything negative said about it and everybody's wanting to come to this school, these black kids and so they needed to get more, a bigger building 'cause the house wasn't big enough.  And so they said, "Could we sell your house, Simon, and buy another school?"  Well they sold the house, they didn't have money to pay but we were able to rent from a Catholic church.  They rented us some space but then there was no money to pay the teachers.  The first year I paid the teachers' salaries--
Speaker 1: I was going to ask you, how do you staff that.
Speaker 2: --in the school.  I paid everything.  I paid everything that first year plus buying the house.  So they sold the house, and this is not for praise for myself, but it's just a story that you need to hear and so, or I guess you want to hear it, and so they said we don't have any money to pay the teachers, could we use the money for selling the house to pay the teachers but we'll still pay you back someday, 'cause I have a soft heart, I said, okay.  So I let them sell the house and they paid the teachers for one whole year.  And then my foundation, I have The Simon Estes International Foundation for Children in Zurich, Switzerland that I founded and so that foundation was able to help send some money to them, to help in the school and then I did some benefit concerts to raise money to give to the school and now the school is really thriving.  I just spoke with the minister of education last May I was there, they're now going to, it's going to be under the public school system so they can, because we have to move it into a different building and now we have four hundred students in this school, four hundred students.  And, in fact, I just talked with Tessa [ph.], the head of the school last week and next year we'll have 450 students in the school, and it's just thriving like mad.  As I said, they've sung four times for Mandela [Nelson Mandela], for Desmond Tutu, et cetera and they wanted to name it after me so I said okay, but it's, it's, we're going to now get federal assistance for the South African edu- school of, board of education, department of education, whatever you call it, to help us but still I have to help continue to raise money because we still have a strong emphasis on music in the school.
Story_ID: 323579
Speaker 1: You have an educational foundation in Tulsa, Oklahoma also?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: What's the genesis of that and what--
Speaker 2: That was founded in 1983, I believe it was.  I was singing for the Tulsa Opera and I have some pictures here of one of the roles I sang there, and they asked me to speak at the McLain High School [McLain High School for Science and Technology, Tulsa, Oklahoma], it's a predominantly all-black high school in Tulsa.  I went there and spoke and I just, my heart gets moved, God moves my heart. And I thought, I just have a feeling that a lot of these kids will go to college if they had some assistance.  So I met with Jayne Reed, an African American lady whose husband was a doctor, at her house, and some other lawyers, and we founded the Simon Estes Educational Foundation [Tulsa, Oklahoma].  We've now given out about three hundred scholarships to kids from Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts], Yale [Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut], Boston University [Boston, Massachusetts], on down, University of Oklahoma [Norman, Oklahoma], Tulsa [University of Tulsa, Tulsa, Oklahoma], et cetera and, with a special emphasis on minority groups but most of it, the college scholarships have gone to non-minority groups, male and female. And, as I said, and I've helped them raise more than $3,500,000 and I've gone back every year and done a big benefit concert and instead of accepting a fee, I let them have it.  So, you know, I have donated more than $400,000 to this school, or to the foundation, but there are so many kids that are doc- in fact, an interesting story.  My, the co-founder, Jayne Reed, her mother was very ill, was rushed to a hospital in Tulsa, she's over eighty years of age and she was so sick they couldn't, she couldn't get her name out, clear, so to make a long story short, they wouldn't accept her because they didn't have the papers for insurance and this doctor went by and he knew who she was.  He knew that she was the mother of Jayne Reed, the co-founder of the Simon Estes Educational Foundation.  She said, take this woman, he more or less saved her life and that he's a doctor today, this guy, and he was actually from Vietnam.  So the foundation in Tulsa has been a big thing and, and we've sent, as I said, about three hundred kids to, to college and univ- fifty-two different colleges and universities in the United States we've sent to college.

Speaker 1: Now I understand, and I think you also alluded to the fact earlier in our interview, that you have not forgotten, and you still pay attention to Iowa and to your roots there.
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: What are some of the things you've established there and are continuing to perpetuate?
Speaker 2: I have a Simon Estes Iowa Educational Foundation which we give, educate, scholarships to students.  The Simon Estes, the Simon and Westella [Westella Estes], my sister who was killed in the car accident, after they named that auditorium [Simon Estes Auditorium] after me in Centerville, Iowa, at the high school [Centerville High School], there's a, and I included her name in that foundation although it was founded before she was killed, that gives scholarships to kids who go to the junior college in Centerville, Iowa, is now called, Center--Indian Hills Community College [Centerville Campus of Indian Hills Community College] or something in Centerville, Iowa.  So, and I've received the Iowan award which is the highest award.  They've only given fourteen in the history of the State of Iowa and I've been the only African American and the first African American to receive the Iowa award.  I do a lot in the State of Iowa.  They've named a, they built an arena after me, the Simon Estes [Simon Estes Riverfront Amphitheater, Des Moines, Iowa], what's it called, it's not an arena, it's an outdoor, I can't even think of the word of it, where they perform outside, stadium, no it's not a stadium.  Isn't it funny I can't, the Simon Estes--
Speaker 1: We have one down here in the esplanade [Charles River Esplanade, Boston, Massachusetts] but I don't know its, what it's called.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and they give, it's a book that in the summertime, it's an out of door place to give concerts but it's the Simon Estes, I could call my wife, just two seconds.  I can't remember what they call it.  She'll tell me in two seconds.  Hi my love.  I'm still being interviewed.  What is that called in Des Moines [Iowa], that thing they named after me, the arena, whatever it's called, the Simon Estes what?  Oh, amphitheater, that's it, okay, thank you my love.  Thanks, bye, goodbye, bye.  The Simon Estes Amphitheater, and I was very touched that they did that and, so my roots in Iowa, there was discrimination in Iowa but we have great educational institutions in Iowa. In fact Iowa is still number one in literacy in the whole United States.  More people can read, you know, percentagewise per capita in Iowa than any other state in the United States.  The schools were superb and the colleges are superb and we don't have Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] but all of our universities, whether it's the University of Iowa [Iowa City, Iowa] or Iowa State University [Ames, Iowa], they're great educational institutions.  My roots were there.  I've been honored with many different honors that I can't even begin to tell you.  So I go back to the State of Iowa and I brought all these African students from, no, I brought forty-one African students from my school [Simon Estes Music High School, Cape Town, South Africa] in South Africa to fifteen different private and public high schools in Iowa about eight years ago, forty-one, and my sister [Erdyne Estes Whiteside] helped raise money, we raised, we calculated how much it costs to keep forty-one students there for a whole year because many of them that came they had worms, they got medical treatment, they got healthy.  About $800,000 was all donated by people in the State of Iowa to help these black African kids go to high school in the United States and nine of them have come back and graduated.  In fact, that was one I just spoke with now who's getting his master's [degree] at Louisiana State University [Baton Rouge, Louisiana].  They've all done extremely well and these, these black kids never had a chance and I'm happy for them.

Speaker 1: What brought you to Boston University [Boston, Massachusetts]?  Is this your first appointment here or--
Speaker 2: Yes the first one and this is my second year.
Speaker 1: What brought you here?
Speaker 2: Ann Howard Jones, the conductor of the choir here, at Boston University, I just, in fact I was just leaving Tulsa, Oklahoma after having been there when Desmond Tutu came and spoke for my twentieth anniversary, this, my Simon Estes Educational Foundation [Tulsa, Oklahoma], on my cell phone, he said, "Simon [HistoryMaker Simon Estes], they're looking for a teacher at Boston University in the voice department, would you come out and talk to the people?"  I said, well, "Okay, yeah. " She said they really want--I came out, I met with Walt Meissner, with Andre de Quadros, head of the School of Music.  Walt Meissner, as you know, is the dean of the College of Fine Arts, and then some other faculty, and that very next day they, they hired me.  And so I do a lot here.  I work with the students with opera.  I teach voice. I teach diction, acting, they've created two courses called performance skills that they just created for me here, and this was the second semester, performance skills and from the last semester to this semester, the enrollment doubled.  And so they're working me to death but I love to share with these young people what I've learned from having performed with all the great conductors, Leonard Bernstein, Zubin Mehta, Solti [Georg Solti], James Levine, I've sung with every major conductor in the world, all the major opera houses.  So what I do I share these experiences with these young students and I never want to dictate or dominate their lives.  I just tell them, this is what I've learned, I share with you.  If it's something that helps you, take it, if it doesn't help you, cast it away.  Another big honor I had, I did the role of Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] at Piccadilly Theatre [London, England] in 1991 and [HistoryMaker] Maya Angelou, who's named as she wrote the lyrics, and it was a big success but the press killed it because, I think of racial discrimination. But the people, the opening night of the Piccadilly Theatre line, they were standing in the aisles, all over, screaming like mad at the end, it was a great thing, and I was in Martin Luther--I have heard Martin Luther King speak when he was still alive, at Coe College [Cedar Rapids, Iowa] in Iowa.  And I was in Coretta Scott's [Coretta Scott King] house, I knew Coretta well and she gave us permission to do the musical and everything but that was another big, big, big honor and it was, and I've been, Maya Angelou and I have been together a number of times.  I respect Maya to the nth degree.  I cannot tell you how blessed I feel.  I sang for two popes, you know, in the Catholic--the other pope was John Paul [Saint Pope John Paul II] back in 1950--'65 [sic.] in the Berlin Opera [Deutsche Oper Berlin, Berlin, Germany], went down to Rome [Italy] and performed in Rome.  And I've been to Israel.  I knew Rabin [Yitzhak Rabin] before he was assassinated.  I was in Revivim [Israel], the kibbutz where Golda Meir lived.  As I said, I've been in Rio [Rio de Janeiro, Brazil], South America.  I've sung for so many kings and presidents, King Juan Carlos of Spain [Juan Carlos I], of Sweden, of Norway, I don't know, all these things.
Speaker 1: You sung for them--
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: --in their presence.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Did you have opportunities then to, to dine with them?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: To talk with them?
Speaker 2: Yes, yeah, they were dinners, oh yeah, and King Juan Carlos, I've got to find, I know I have pictures I've taken with him and of Norway and Sweden and the Queen of Denmark, I met all these people.
Story_ID: 323582
Speaker 1: Pope John Paul [Saint Pope John Paul II].  What, what was he like?
Speaker 2: He was a wonderful man.  I sang at two different times for him at the Vatican and before he got really, you know, not so coherent, he was a wonderful, as I said, I'm not Catholic but he was a good man, a very good man and he really wanted peace. And we know he traveled a lot and I have photos, you'll see it in the book ['Simon Estes: In His Own Voice,' Simon Estes and Mary L. Swanson] of my being with him.  He was an amazing man. Probably the most amazing person though I tell you, my presence, even though you haven't asked this question, but having been in the presence with Nelson Mandela.  There's a living legend to think that this man was incarcerated unjustly for twenty-seven years.  I've been on Robben Island [South Africa], I have been in the cell where he was.  I've seen where he broke white stones in which damaged his eyesight but here was a man that got out of prison and never preached bitterness or revenge or hatred and ended up becoming president of his country.  I cannot tell you how I, I marvel at this man and you know what, the press never picked up on, 'cause you remember a lot of the whites left when he was elected because they figured there's going to be this rebellion, all the blacks are going to come out and kill all the whites.  Not one single white person was killed in South Africa after apartheid other than that they were robbed, the black people got robbed and killed, but, out of from revenge, not one.  Isn't that amazing?  The press didn't pick that up but no, Mandela was, he's a truly, truly living legend.  And [HistoryMaker] Maya Angelou is a woman and a lady that I've been in her presence and even in her home a number of times that, when I'm in Maya's presence, I can't hardly talk.  There's something, have you been--you know Maya personally?
Speaker 1: Well, you know I danced with her in Ghana.
Speaker 2: You did.
Speaker 1: She was the keynote speaker at the final banquet--
Speaker 2: Then you know--isn't she something.
Speaker 1: --for the National Council of Black Studies [sic. National Council for Black Studies].
Speaker 2: No kidding.
Speaker 1: They had their seventeenth annual conference in Ghana.
Speaker 2: Oh, really.
Speaker 1: And so I went and that was in 1993 and they had the social hour and the dancing before the dinner and everybody--and so I danced briefly with her, maybe a minute or so but she was, she was--
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's all right, but you still did.
Speaker 1: --moving around, I danced with her.
Speaker 2: I can see she might say, she said, "I still remember him."  Maya is a lady that when I'm in her presence, I feel that small.  I didn't feel small with Nelson but there's something special about Maya Angelou.  There's just, I tell people she, she's amaz- and what, you know, what she does with words, unbelievable.
Story_ID: 323583
Speaker 1: There's one other individual and then we'll take a break, to me, he is my favorite president, I admire him as a president and you sang before President Lyndon Johnson [President Lyndon Baines Johnson].  Tell me about being in his presence briefly.  Did you have a chance to talk with Lyndon?
Speaker 2: A little bit and I have photos of him too, of me with him, and his wife [Lady Bird Johnson].  He was, he was a good man.  You know, a lot of presidents got caught up in a certain situ--the Vietnam War destroyed his, let's face it, but he, he really did a lot for civil rights, whether he wanted to originally, when he was governor or whatever, that's beside the point.  He did follow through on the things that Martin [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] started and, and Bobby Kennedy [Robert F. Kennedy] and John Kennedy [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy] and he was, not a loud speaking man as you might remember.  He had a large head but--
Speaker 1: Do you remember any particular conversation that you had with him or any--
Speaker 2: No, it was all music.  I sang at the White House [Washington, D.C.] along with two other singers and a cellist at one end which I, not, no, just that he was so happy.
Speaker 1: You didn't have a chance to dialog with--
Speaker 2: No, not just one-on-one but I was with him, I shook his hand and we talked but not deep conversations.
Speaker 1: Ah.
Story_ID: 323584
Speaker 1: Professor Estes [HistoryMaker Simon Estes], you've performed in a little over 100 roles in operas, 101, and then you were telling me that there's another one on the horizon.  Tell us about 102.
Speaker 2: One hundred and two is right here at Boston University [Boston, Massachusetts] with the students.  They asked me to participate in 'Don Giovanni' [Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart] and do the role of the Commendatore, and so I agreed to do that, so that makes 102 roles I've done.  The last one, I did the 101st role was in Barcelona, Spain, I portrayed the role of King Henry VIII with Montserrat Caballe, the Spanish, the famous Spanish soprano in Barcelona at the Teatre del Liceu [Gran Teatre del Liceu, Barcelona, Spain] over there and, but I've done, yeah, over 100 roles.
Speaker 1: And how do you feel about this newest one coming up?  What--
Speaker 2: Well, it's short so it makes me very happy, I didn't have a lot to learn 'cause I get killed after about the first minute and a half of the opera, when my, I should say after my entrance, I'm dead, but then I come back again as a ghost at the end, try to get Don Giovanni to repent of all the young ladies he seduced and misused, et cetera, cetera. He doesn't do it and, and so he ends up getting punished in hell.  They drag him right down to hell but it's a, it's all, the role of the Commendatore is always performed by a top bass in every opera house because the role has such importance, because the opera starts out with Leporello singing, night and day he's got to work for Giovanni and then all of a sudden the Commendatore comes in and sees Don Giovanni trying to seduce his daughter, let's say Donna Anna, and so he's killed right away.  So, the whole opera then, it's like through the whole circle, at the end, the Commendatore comes back again in the form of this statue, ghost, whatever you want to say, and tries to get Don Giovanni, not only to repent, although he doesn't say this literally what he was trying to do with his daughter, but with all the other women, he doesn't do it.  So, the way they staged it here is the women get him, they put him in a cage and drag him into hell.  So, it's been, it's been enjoyable working with the students and it's, it's quite nice to do a role that maybe I only sing five minutes instead of singing three hours.  And so, it's (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) How--
Speaker 2: --it's an enjoyable role.
Story_ID: 323585
Speaker 1: Do you select the roles that you've performed in these various operas over the years or do people come to you?  How do you, how do you--
Speaker 2: Well, I have managers in, in Germany, in the United States and Switzerland and France and Spain and Italy, I've had managers in all these countries, and what happens, once you reach a certain status, maybe status but a certain plateau as an opera singer, you're in demand. And, and usually singers kind of specialize in certain composers and my specialty has been many different composers but I've been known as a Wagnerian and a Verdi [Giuseppe Verdi] singer because of the, of a powerful voice and you need this type of voice to sing Wagnerian roles and roles by Verdi and Puccini [Giacomo Puccini] but, so they usually ask me to sing these roles, and they contact my various managers, and I have an option to say yes or no.  If it's a new opera then, of course, I have to learn the role in that opera, but over the years I've, I've sung so many roles that I just don't have to, you know, learn new operas anymore.  That opera right there, that's 'Aida' [Giuseppe Verdi] and in this opera, I've sung three roles.  I've sung the king, Ramfis, who's the high priest and Amonasro who is the father of Aida and this opera, well--
Speaker 1: And you had to learn all of that?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.  This one has about three hundred pages in it.  I mean, I don't see all the, I don't sing all three hundred pages, but some operas that are like 'Parsifal' [Richard Wagner], one of Wagnerian's operas is like six hours long with intermissions.
Story_ID: 323586
Speaker 1: Well, how long does it take you to memorize all this?
Speaker 2: I had another gift, God's been very gracious and kindly gave me a lot of gifts.  I didn't know I had a gift to memorize until I went to Berlin [Germany] at the Deutsche Oper [Deutsche Oper Berlin, Berlin, Germany] and they told me I had to sing the king in 'Aida' [Giuseppe Verdi], so I came back to the states and studied, and when I arrived thirteen days before my debut, and I had never been on an opera stage, instead I just sing Ramfis which is a bigger role and I called my teacher in New York [New York] and he said, "Well, I don't understand it, Simon [HistoryMaker Simon Estes], and well, just study hard."  So I learned it in thirteen days.  Didn't have an orchestra rehearsal, didn't see the conductor until the curtain went apart and Ramfis starts to sing, but then I realized I had a gift to memorize fast and that's what helped me a lot in my career, 'cause conductors or orchestras, if somebody got sick or something, they knew they'd call Simon Estes, he could learn it real fast.  I have actually memorized another opera by Verdi [Giuseppe Verdi] called 'Nabucco' in four days.  I memorized a whole opera.  I memorized the role of Dosifey in a Russian opera called, 'Khovanshchina' [Modest Mussorgsky] and in Russian, I memorized that in five days, in Russian, but it isn't that I would say that I'm extraordinarily intelligent, not at all, it was a matter of discipline and concentration and hard work. And we know those three qualities help us in many, many other areas in our life and I try to teach this or share it with young people. But I just concentrated very, very hard and I could just, in fact, maybe work on them, ten, twelve hours a day but I could do it.  I don't know if my brain cells will still do it at my old age now, might take me a little bit longer, although the Commendatore, it's not a long part, you know, it was very easy to memorize that.
Story_ID: 323587
Speaker 1: How many more operas do you think you will be able to do?
Speaker 2: You know, I don't know if I will, actually, because, as I said, I've sung opera for forty, it'll be forty years the 19th of April, I will have completed forty-one years, because I made my debut in '65 [1965] and this is '66 [sic. 2006] and I think it's time, even though I feel very blessed by God that I can still sing.  Many singers, ten years younger than I am, have stopped or even a little younger, but as I stated to you before, I will be sixty-eight in less than a month, and I'm still able to sing and I can still sing Wotan, I can still sing 'The Flying Dutchman' [Richard Wagner], but I'm just not doing it, because I'm enjoying sharing what I've learned with these young students, plus I've traveled all around the world, and I'm tired of traveling.  Even though I still love it, I want to stay home.
Story_ID: 323588
Speaker 1: How has your voice changed over the forty-one years?
Speaker 2: It's gotten stronger and it's the range, even though I always had a long range, and it's, it's even gotten higher and lower.  I have a, people hear, I don't want to use such a stupid like freakish voice, but I have a very unusual voice, and I don't take the credit for it.  I take--I give God the praise and the glory for it, I really do, because at my age I shouldn't be able to sing the way I sing.  I'm very, very much aware of that because of having been in the business for this many years and most singers don't sing 'til--when they're about seventy. But for some reason they're, I think God still wants me to sing so I still do orchestra days.  For example, last year I did Verdi [Giuseppe Verdi] 'Requiem,' I did 'Elegie,' the Faure [Gabriel Faure] 'Requiem,' I sang with the Wartburg Choir [at Wartburg College, Waverly, Iowa] and orchestra with the same thing at Iowa State University [Ames, Iowa].  Here in Boston [Massachusetts], I'm singing with 'Don Giovanni' [Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart], I'm going to go, when they go to Carnegie Hall [New York, New York], I want to sing with the orchestra and the choir there.  So I'm doing some singing with the universities and then I do a few recitals with piano or orchestra days.  For example this year, I said, yeah, last year I did the 'Elegie,' the Verdi 'Requiem,' Faure and these things I still do but the reason I've cut down on the opera 'cause if you go there, you have to have six to eight weeks of rehearsal time and you've got to perform for a couple of weeks and I'd rather spend that time, in that I've done it, let young people come in and have a chance and spend my time teaching and working with the young people. But I could, if I, if someone wanted me to, I could go out and sing all the roles I've sung before.  I think I could.
Story_ID: 323589
Speaker 1: 'Simon Estes: In His Own Voice' [Simon Estes and Mary L. Swanson] is your autobiography.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: How did you happen to write that and how did you accomplish that?  Why did you do it?
Speaker 2: In the mid-'70s [1970s], and I hadn't done as much then as I have, obviously later, some people knew about my history, my life, my birth, my childhood, et cetera and then what I'd already accomplished up to that point, said, you should write a book.  And a professional writer wanted to write a book about my life in the mid-'70s [1970s] in New York City [New York, New York] and I said, no.  And then I just started writing by myself, by hand, and then I realized I didn't have time, so I ran into a schoolmate who went to high school with me [at Centerville High School, Centerville, Iowa], who was a librarian now, in her lifestyle, but in high school she was one year ahead of me, she's graduated the same year you did out of high school. And I was singing in Texas with the orchestra, and I believe it was in San Antonio [Texas], with the symphony orchestra, right, and she was there and we hadn't seen each other for twenty-five, thirty years.  And so we had a nice talk and she, and her husband was there, we talked, and her sons and her daughters, et cetera, and so she was just there visiting her son, that's right.  And so I left and I started thinking, I should get Mary, her name was Carpenter, Mary Carpenter, her married name was Swanson [Mary L. Swanson], and then she's a librarian, I thought she must know a lot about books, maybe she can help me write my autobiography.  So I called her and mentioned it to her and it was, and she was from Centerville, Iowa, which was fascinating.  So, what she did, we flew her over to Switzerland and I just talked in a tape recorder for, I don't know how many hours, over a period of probably three years, and it's all my words but then she organized everything for me and then we found a publisher.

Speaker 1: Roland Hayes is (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, I knew Roland Hayes, yes.
Speaker 1: --is my, yeah.  Tell me when you met Roland and how you knew him.
Speaker 2: He was the first big main Porgy, I think, right?  Wasn't that--yeah, he was.  He and what's her name?  African American lady who grew, spent most of her time in Sweden?  He, and he taught voice down in Washington, D.C., you know, voice for many years.  He was a great man.  I, the reason I had sadness for him and for [HistoryMaker] William Warfield is because, and Paul Robeson, these men had great voices that they should have been opera singers but because their being African American men and in that time they were never allowed to use their voices as they should have, so I felt badly that Roland Hayes did not get to be heard the way he should have been heard as an opera singer.
Speaker 1: Oh, when were you in his presence?  You said that you--
Speaker 2: It was a number of years ago, I think I met him twice.  The last time I met him was in Washington, D.C. in his home, I wish I could remember, I'm trying to remember that's when I did 'Macbeth' [Giuseppe Verdi], I mean when I did 'Simon Boccanegra' [Giuseppe Verdi] in D.C. or maybe it was before that, but it was in Washington, D.C., in his home.
Speaker 1: You say in his home.  Are you thinking of William Warfield or Roland Hayes?
Speaker 2: No, I've never been in William Warfield's home.
Speaker 1: Oh, 'cause Roland's home was here in Brookline, Massachusetts.
Speaker 2: Well who's the other man that I'm thinking about, an African American man?  Warfield, Roland Hayes, who's the other one?  There's one more that I'm thinking of and he was in Washington, D.C., really famous.  Let me think.
Speaker 1: Maybe we'll come back to that one.
Speaker 2: I was thinking Roland Hayes but you're right, it wasn't Roland Hayes and Roland Hayes was not the one that sang the Porgy with--
Speaker 1: I didn't think so.
Speaker 2: --what's her name?  Oh, she sang the first Bess, African American lady.  In fact, I've even met her.
Speaker 1: The names escape me at the moment.
Speaker 2: You know this man and I can't think of his name either.  Another, well, speaking of big honors, I sang a concert at Carnegie Hall [New York, New York] years ago in memory of Paul Robeson too, and Paul Robeson, Jr. organized the whole thing.  I knew him and know him.
Speaker 1: I'm looking forward to your, to your book.  So you got the help and--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --you've got involved.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.

Speaker 1: One other honor that you had was a resolution passed by, by the U.S. Congress.  Did that happen?
Speaker 2: Which one?  I did have, I've got to remember which one it was.
Speaker 1: House Resolution 115, a partial bill history, house resolution.
Speaker 2: I have to remember which--
Speaker 1: It kind of outlines your life--
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: --and steps in your life.
Speaker 2: I have to remember when this was.
Speaker 1: You may not have been there.  Somebody probably recommended that Congress recognize your work.
Speaker 2: Right, I, you know what, I remember about this, Cornell College [Mount Vernon, Iowa] and League of Women Voters of Iowa was at that dinner.  You see I sang on this, you remember when Marian Anderson, yeah, remember Marian Anderson sang on the steps of the Constitution Hall [Washington, D.C.]?  They had me come there and sing a number of years ago with the [U.S.] Air Force band, that was in Constitution Hall and they asked me if I would come sing for this special event.  I remember it was what they said, we'd like it to be all negro spirituals and so they had somebody do all the arrangements and because they don't pay you when you're doing anything for the government, it was an honor if you sing at the White House [Washington, D.C.], at least, and so they, they gave me all the orchestra parts and I'm trying to remember if this was the same time when they did that.  I, I, you know what?  I remember when I was asked about this.  Isn't that funny, I don't remember.
Speaker 1: Oh, I'm sure you, we don't expect you to remember--
Speaker 2: Everything.
Speaker 1: --all the events and all the turning points.
Speaker 2: But you know what, if you could, if you could e-mail that to me, I want to read--
Speaker 1: You can, you can keep that.
Speaker 2: Can I have this?  You've got one, okay, good, 'cause I have to remember when that was.  I have so many medals that I don't have here, from the Tchaikovsky Competition [International Tchaikovsky Competition] from, they're all out in Wartburg College [Waverly, Iowa], 'cause they created like a Simon Estes wing--
Speaker 1: Archive.
Speaker 2: --where we have tons more stuff here, but it's really honors and medals and things that we don't have here that I, don't even remember, that because--
Speaker 1: Well, they're back in your, in your roots, and all (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, right.
Story_ID: 323592
Speaker 1: Let's move to the wrap-up questions.  Is there anything else that you'd like to add to this interview that I haven't asked you about?
Speaker 2: I would like to see the day when we could have more people of color singing in opera houses, being directors and managers of opera houses, being managers of artists with big management companies, being conductors of the leading orchestras in this country, being in positions to be the head of a ballet, to be a ballerina, to do leading roles in major operas.  I would like to see women given more freedom to, to conduct, even though I know we still think of that as being a male-dominated, but I've sung with some female conductors who are very good.  Sure, it's something that all of us have to get used to, not only visually, but, but realistically speaking 'cause in the old days, I mean, you know just a few years ago, they didn't have any women in the Berlin Philharmonic orchestra or the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra.  They wouldn't allow women to play in those orchestras.  I'd like to see the day when people will be accepted on their talent, their merit and not on their skin color nor their gender.  Sure, I'm speaking of heaven and I guess we can't have heaven on earth but I would long for the day when all of us human beings could get along as God's children because we're really all the same except for the epidermis, maybe the texture of our hair or eyes, but whether you're white, black or whatever color you are, what's on the inside is what counts.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 323593
Speaker 1: Who are some of the African American women that you have performed with?
Speaker 2: Leontyne Price, Grace Bumby--Bumbry, Shirley Verrett, Shirley Verrett, Martina Arroyo, [HistoryMaker] Jessye Norman, Kathleen Battle, [HistoryMaker] Denyce Graves, Felicia Weathers, Gloria Davy, some of these you may not know, Leona Mitchell, I've sung with all of the African American great women and then also with the--
Speaker 1: Where did you sing with Leontyne Price?  Do you recall?
Speaker 2: The first time was in San Francisco [California] in the opera 'Aida' [Giuseppe Verdi] and then I sang with her in her farewell performance at the Metropolitan Opera [Metropolitan Opera House, New York, New York] in 'Aida,' which she sang Aida and I sang Amonasro.  Leontyne was a great groundbreaker for all of us and she suffered a lot being a person of color, a lady of color.  They threatened her life when she opened the Met [Metropolitan Opera House] in 'Antony and Cleopatra' [Samuel Barber], at the new Met in Lincoln Center [Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, New York, New York].  People wrote letters to her, she told me herself, and threatened her life and actually said, "Nigger, you open the Met and we're going to kill you," but she went ahead and did it and she didn't get killed.  So, I really admire Leontyne and she was a lady of dignity.  She wasn't a clown, she wasn't a funny person, she was very serious and she, even more than Marian Anderson, really did some--Marian Anderson was denied, as was Paul Robeson, and I almost remember that other baritone's name that we were thinking of.
Speaker 1: We'll come to it, we'll come to it.
Speaker 2: And, but see, when they brought Marian Anderson into the Met, she could barely be a narrator because she was way beyond her prime which was not fair. But Leontyne was really the first one and then [HistoryMaker] George Shirley, an American tenor, who the Met brought in as a first, well there was another great black baritone, oh, what's his name?  His, his, he's conducted the Boston Orchestra [Boston Symphony Orchestra] here?  Long hair, his father was also a singer.  He's a black conductor here in Boston [Massachusetts].  You know who I mean, a young guy?  It's funny I'm forgetting all these names right now.  His father sang at the Met, well, it doesn't matter, but those are--
Speaker 1: I interviewed, I interviewed as a HistoryMaker, Julius Wilson--
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's not, yeah.
Speaker 1: --who is now teaching at Berkeley [University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, California], but he's, do you know Julius?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: He's a conductor, composer but his father was not a musician so--
Speaker 2: What I, but you know to sum it up, I would just love to see the day when--
Story_ID: 323594
Speaker 1: How's that going to happen?  I mean, you have foundations, you've got scholarship programs, you have schools that you've established so do you see that hopefully happening?
Speaker 2: You know, I just taught Gregg Baker, you know the name Gregg Baker?  He's an African American baritone that just wrote an article in Opera News, February issue of Opera News, get it.  Get a copy from somebody.  I haven't read the interview yet but they gave me a copy, February issue of Opera News, he brought up again, see, they used to be unhappy with me because I spoke out on the racial issue, especially about African American men and my managers and many people said, "Simon [HistoryMaker Simon Estes], don't talk about it, it's going to hurt you."  I would have had a bigger career, in quotes if I kept my mouth shut, but I couldn't do that.  You have to speak out whether it's injustice, no matter what it is and I have sung more roles and more opera houses than any black man in the history of this world and there are other men that have talents like mine but they've been denied.  You don't know the black men, young men have called me, they said, "Simon, I'm just so frustrated, they won't engage me," and there's been a, it's gotten worse in the past few years instead of better.  I'm not singing at the Met [Metropolitan Opera House, New York, New York] anymore.  A lot of the blacks are not singing at the Met anymore.  [HistoryMaker] Jessye Norman's not singing.  Kathleen's [Kathleen Battle] not singing.  Denyce [HistoryMaker Denyce Graves] is still singing there but, and, and if I were to ask you right now, name me a black conductor of a leading symphon- philharmonic orchestra in the United States.  If I were to say, name me the director of an opera company in the United States or the manager of an orchestra in the United States, I (background music) could--or stage director, to stage and produce operas, it's almost zero.  So, most people don't realize it, it's still one of the most prejudiced areas in our society today is in the classical and performing arts form, that's, sorry about that.  There's a professor next door.  There's nothing we can do about it.  He's teaching now.  A little background music.  He just turned it off but you know if you need another question or something, are you living here too?
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  No, I, we are going, I'm stationed in New York.
Speaker 2: Oh, okay, 'cause I was going to say if ever you needed another something, you could always call me or if you just needed to know some questions yourself without the camera, I'm here, you're here, I'm here 'til the 25th of this month, so don't hesitate to call.
Speaker 1: Oh, I won't, I won't.

Speaker 1: How do you feel about the way that you've lived your life so far?
Speaker 2: The best way I can explain it to you is I feel tremendously blessed and humbled by God.  My parents [Ruth Jeter Estes and Simon Estes] taught me humility and the teacher who discovered me, Mr. Kellis [Charles Kellis], out at the University of Iowa [Iowa City, Iowa], without this man, as I said, I wouldn't be sitting here today.  His name is Charles Kellis.  I had no money to pay him and I wasn't at that time in the, quote, school of music but he gave me free voice lessons.  I said, "Well Mr. Kellis, if I ever have a career, I'd like to pay you back."  He said, "Simon [HistoryMaker Simon Estes], it's not if, it's when.  You will have a career," he said, "but all I want you to do is remain humble."  I've never forgotten those words and I, I know I've talked a lot about myself, 'cause you've asked me to talk about myself.
Speaker 1: That's what this is about.
Speaker 2: I say these things, but I really believe in humility.  I believe in gratitude.  I believe in respect and kindness and I just, the best way, I just feel very blessed 'cause God's giving me a number of gifts and of course he says in the Bible, "To whom much is given, much is expected" and I, I start out every day with prayer and basically every day reading my Bible.  I've read it through more than one time from cover to cover.  My wife and I read it together, study it together.  I find it really the greatest book.  I still read it all the time and I find something new all the time in it but it's the foundation of my life and I love the 27th Psalm, the Psalm that says, "The Lord is my light, the strength of my salvation whom then shall I fear, whom shall I be afraid.  The Lord is the strength of my life," [Psalms 27:1]. And my mother [Ruth Jeter Estes] taught me as a young child, she said, "Son, make sure you always put the Lord first in your life," and that's what I try to do.  I don't go around with bumper stickers on my car saying I'm a Christian.  It's a bit--although I am a Christian, it's good to let your light shine and people can see, you know, what you are and I try to live a good life.  I try to help young people, not for personal glory or gratification but to help them because I know that when I was in college, I shined shoes, scrubbed floors, cleaned toilets, did windows, you name it, I did everything I had to do in order to get through college and I always said, if ever I'm blessed someday I want to try to help other young people, so that's why I do what I do today, whether it's here or with the scholarship funds or whatever.
Speaker 1: What do you still want to do that you have not yet done?
Speaker 2: Well, it's something that I guess I can't do and because Jesus couldn't do it, I would love to be able to bring peace to this world and get people to love one another but I can't do it but I, but what I do, do is try to make a small contribution, whether it's through my singing or teaching, before I go out to sing I always pray that God will take me and use me as a person.  I say, "Lord, I pray that someone's heart will be touched out in the audience to love you and to love one another," and that's why I sing.
Speaker 1: Is there anything you have already done that you would like to have done differently?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, that's a question that, you know, many people are asked and we'd all say but, hindsight we know of many times we say it's always better but I think you have to take things in perspective.  At the time, we did okay--fortunately, I've never, I've never drunk; I've never taken drugs.  I, you know, I've never done things like that.  I don't know.  If I think professionally or in certain things, I don't know if I would change many things.  I don't think so.  Not that I didn't make mistakes; I made mistakes along the way, I'm not perfect. But I've always tried to, to live a good life.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 323596
Speaker 1: How do you want to be remembered?  What do you want people to say about you?
Speaker 2: Well, that this is a man who, who loved God and loves God.  Who loves peace.  Who loves caring for other people.  Who loves sharing.  Who's enjoyed singing, very, very much.  Who feels blessed that God gave him a number of gifts that he has tried or tried to use to the glory of God and not for personal gain or personal recognition but that people, to quote my present wife [Ovida Strong Estes] when I was going with her, something that I will never forget, she said, "Simon [HistoryMaker Simon Estes], I see Christ in you," and I, no one ever said that to me before though people have come up to me after the performance and say, "You're a man of God aren't you?"  "You believe in God don't you?" And I always say, "Well, yes," but she, when she said that, it was just really very touching and what it did it made me feel, wow, you've got to be a better person, you've got to be a better person, Simon.  So I'm constantly trying to improve my life in every aspect, every way but I just say, remember me as a man who loved peace and loved God and--
Speaker 1: Well, let me thank you for, for being so gracious and so gracious in sharing your life and your feelings and let me also thank you for the life that, that you've lived.
Speaker 2: Thank you.
Speaker 1: Alright.

Speaker 1: This is the opera, 'The Valkyrie' ['Die Walkure, Richard Wagner] and Germans say 'Die Walkure' and I was singing the role of Wotan in Tulsa, Oklahoma in 1980 with Barbara Conrad as Fricka, my wife.  It's the first time an African American could ever sing the role of Wotan in Tulsa and also to have an African American female as his wife so that was, 'Die Walkure,' [HistoryMaker] Simon Estes singing Wotan in 1980 in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Speaker 2: That's kind of bent over.  Does that, yeah, is that okay?
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Yeah, that's fine.  I just need to crop it a little bit.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  All right.
Speaker 2: This is Simon Estes singing 'The Flying Dutchman' [Richard Wagner] at the opera in Paris [France] called the Bastille [Opera Bastille], that's the name of the opera house.  This role I was singing in 1993, I believe it was, in Paris, France.
Speaker 1: Simon Estes singing 'The Flying Dutchman' again at Covent Garden in London [England].  This was a modern production, therefore the costume, as one can see, is quite modern but this was in 19--I believe this was 1995, '96 [1996] that I sang that in Covent Garden in London.
Speaker 2: This is 'Porgy and Bess' [George Gershwin] in Zurich, Switzerland, at the opera house in Zurich where I'm singing Porgy and La Verne Williams is singing Bess and that's the choir, the chorus, in the background and this was 1997, I'm sorry, 1977, 1977 in Zurich, Switzerland, Porgy in 'Porgy and Bess.'
Speaker 1: This is the opera, 'Don Carlos' [Giuseppe Verdi] in which Simon Estes is singing King Philip [King Philip II] and Montserrat Caballe is singing Elizabeth, Queen Elizabeth, my wife, in Orange, France in a festival in an old Roman antique theatre that is out of doors.
Speaker 2: This is the opera 'Carmen' [Georges Bizet].  Simon Estes singing Escamillo in Hamburg, Germany at the Hamburg State Opera House and the lady with the hat on is Teresa Berganza, one of the world's most famous Spanish, Carmen's.
Speaker 1: I remember this as the opera, 'Gotterdammerung' [Richard Wagner] in Seattle, Washington and I believe it was 1977, or '76 [1976], I sang the role of Hagen and Hagen--I'm in the middle there, where I've broken something in two.  I don't know anybody that's ever sung all of the Wotan's and 'Rheingold' ['Das Rheingold,' Richard Wagner] 'Walkure,' 'Siegfried' [Richard Wagner] and Hagen also but I did that so that's why it's kind of important.  So, Hagen in Seattle, Washington, I believe, 1976.
Speaker 2: Simon Estes and Julia Migenes-Johnson in the opera, 'Salome' [Richard Strauss].  This was in Geneva, Switzerland and I'm singing the role of John the Baptist or Jochanaan in Geneva, Switzerland.
Speaker 1: This is 'Aida' [Giuseppe Verdi] with the famous Leontyne Price singing Aida and that's Simon Estes singing Amonasro, her father.  This was a production done at the opera house in San Francisco, California.
