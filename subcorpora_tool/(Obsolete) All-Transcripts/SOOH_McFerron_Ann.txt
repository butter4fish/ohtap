 Finchum  McFerron  Today is December 16, 2011. My name is Tanya Finchum. I   m with  Oklahoma State University Library. I   m in Billings, Oklahoma to talk  with Ann McFerron, the youngest daughter of Shirley and Henry  Bellmon. Of course, Henry Bellmon   s a former Oklahoma governor and  U.S. senator. Thank you for having me today.  Thank you for coming.  Let   s start with learning a little bit more about you. When and where  were you born?  I was born August 8, 1952 in Enid.  And were your parents in this home at the time?  No. We lived in the old original farmhouse at that time. We lived there  until I was in, well, until 1960. So I would have been, like, the third  grade I think when we moved over here.  And where did you go to elementary school?  I didn   t ever go to kindergarten, but I started school in first grade in  Billings. I was in Billings until the middle of the fifth grade, and that   s  when we moved to Oklahoma City.  And then at that point, where did you go?  I went to Wilson Elementary school.  Through the sixth or seventh?  Well, through half of fifth and all of sixth. And then in seventh grade, I  5  Finchum  McFerron  Finchum  McFerron  went to Classen High School, because Classen was a six-year high  school at that point. I don   t know if it still is. I was at Classen High  School seventh till the middle of the ninth, and then we came back to the  farm. I went to Billings from the middle of the ninth to the middle of my  junior year, and then Dad became a United States Senator. So I went to  Virginia and went to W.T. Woodson High School in Fairfax, Virginia,  and that   s where I graduated. Pat graduated from Classen, Gail  graduated from Billings, and I graduated from Woodson so we all had  different schools at the end.  Was it up to you to decide to go to the Washington one?  For me, no, because they were going. It wasn   t an issue with Gail  because they actually had her graduate from high school early so that  she didn   t have to move the middle of her senior year. They didn   t think  that would be good so she only went for three years. But for me, I  couldn   t have graduated here unless I stayed here with other people, and  they really thought it would be a good experience for me to go. It was  challenging because my graduating class here had sixteen students. My  graduating class at W.T. Woodson, I think, had 600. So that was, of  course, the biggest school I had been to, and to go in the middle of your  junior year was   I remember the first day, crying at the school because  it just was, I guess for me, it was overwhelming and so new and  everything. But it was a great school in that it has a huge military  population.  We were really fairly close to the Pentagon, and I remember them  coming over the loud speaker and announcing who had been accepted to  which military academies and things because that was such a big deal,  and there were so many military kids. And those kids, they move all the  time, every couple years. So they were very welcoming, and they knew  how to get into a school, become an officer, and become involved. They  didn   t waste any time, and so that really helped me to see that just  because I was going to be there just a year, a year and a half, I could still  get involved, and I did, in Keyettes and all the different clubs. It was a  very good experience. I   m glad I went there and got to do that.  Had you done 4-H here before you went?  I did. We all were big 4-H-ers from the time we were   I guess you start  in third or fourth grade, and we did it all the way through. And I did 4-H  in Virginia, because Mom still wanted me to have the experience of  making the bound button holes and all the things you do, making the  wool suits and   or, I made a silk blouse and all this kind of stuff. So I  still stayed involved a little bit, but it was quite a bit different than it was  here, and so it wasn   t that big a deal. I went to some meetings, but I  6  Finchum  McFerron  Finchum  McFerron  Finchum  McFerron  Finchum  McFerron  Finchum  McFerron  don   t remember it being like it was here.  And then you graduated high school in what year?  I graduated in 1970.  And then college?  I came back to OSU. Yes, I remember distinctly, this guy came from  OSU to my high school. I worked in the guidance counselor   s office so I  went to talk to the guy. (Laughs) I already knew what I was doing, or he  may not have been from OSU. He was in some school from Oklahoma.  It   s probably best I don   t say what school because the guy, when I  walked in I guess I said my name was Ann Bellmon, and he said,    Oh,  we have a jerk of a senator named Bellmon from Oklahoma.    (Laughs)  And I said,    Oh, yeah, that jerk   s my father.    (Laughs)  He kind of didn   t say too much after that, but it was just a really dumb  comment for someone to make so that was my introduction. But it may  not have been OSU. It may have been some other school. Anyway, I did  come back to OSU, and I went there until the middle of my junior year  and then I got married. So I actually didn   t graduate from college until I  was forty-seven, or maybe forty-nine. I went back when I was forty-seven  and graduated when I was forty-nine, from the University of  Maryland, in Baltimore.  Better late than never.  Well, it turned out to be a great deal because both of my kids were in  college, and so all three of us were going at the same time. And I  actually graduated one semester before my oldest son so I still graduated  before my kids. And I really enjoyed being in college at that point  because I wanted to learn. It wasn   t like I was just trying to get a grade  and get through. I really wanted the material.  It does make a difference, doesn   t it?  It does, and I think it   s good to have older people in classes. I think the  younger people can get a different perspective, and I think it   s a really  nice balance to have older people.  Well, when you decided to come to OSU, was it for any particular  reason? Did your dad encourage you to do that?  I   m sure, I   m sure. And both my sisters were there. I really didn   t give  any thought to going anywhere else. That was just kind of what you did.  7  Finchum  McFerron  Finchum  McFerron  Finchum  McFerron  What was your major?  FRCD, Family Relations and Child Development. After I got married,  we moved to Alaska, and I did get an associate degree in Alaska in early  childhood development. They didn   t have a four-year degree at that time  in that program so I did kind of finish that program. And then when I  went back later, I could totally change what I was interested in but even  if you never use that major for working with preschoolers or whatever,  it   s a great major for becoming a parent, I think.  Once you got married and moved away, did you have a career?  Yes. Let me think. First, when we got married, we moved to Death  Valley, California, and did that for that year. Then we moved to Alaska,  and I worked at a law firm, and then I went back to school and ran a  childcare center for a while. My husband and I actually traveled, and we  moved a lot. In the first twelve years of our marriage we moved about  fifteen times. (Laughs) You don   t want to hear all these places we   ve  been, but then we did finally have kids, settled down. We lived in  Maryland for twenty years, and I worked at the vo-tech center, the  Center of Applied Technology North for fifteen years or sixteen years so  that was where I really had the career.  And what brought you back to Oklahoma?  Well, we separated. It   s kind of like the OSU thing, I never had a doubt  in my mind that when I separated I was coming back here. I   m just so,  so grateful in so many ways that that happened because I came back,  Dad was, of course, alive, and I spent the last four years with Dad. I  think that was so valuable to be able to be with him, and he never  dreamed that any of us would come back to the farm. I think the thought  had crossed his mind more than once to sell the house and sell the farm.  He just didn   t think that this would ever happen. He didn   t care what  brought me back. He was just thrilled I was back. (Laughs) And I was  thrilled to be back.  I mean, we had our moments. That   s for sure. But it was a perfect  arrangement, because he had remarried after Mom died, so Eloise had  her own house in Kingfisher, and he had this house. There weren   t a lot  of things for her to do here, and there weren   t as many things for him to  do there. He loved to be here, and he went to cardiac rehab three times a  week so he would drive from here to Enid, do cardiac rehab, and then go  to Kingfisher, and that would be like Monday. Then on Wednesday,  he   d drive from Kingfisher back to cardiac rehab and then back here.  And then on Friday, he   d do the same thing so he got into a real routine,  8  Finchum  McFerron  Finchum  McFerron  and he had some time here and some time there.  When he was gone, I had my time to myself and that was important and  good. And then when he was here, we could go and see the farm and see  the cows and check everything out, which farmers do on a regular basis.  They   ve got to know that every pasture hasn   t changed or whatever. I   m  not sure what they   re looking for, but anyway. He   s a real constant  educator and was always teaching me. Really, that   s important because  if you   re going to live on a farm, you need to know where things are and  how things work and when they break, what you do and who you call. It  just seems more important here than in a city because here, it   s harder to  get people to come out and just to know what to do and how to winterize  everything, and so that was good. We enjoyed that. And we visited the  pecan grove that he planted in his later years. And he looked for those  pecans, and then finally we did see some pecans the last year of his life,  so that was good.  Did you take notes?  I did. I actually would get my computer and his whole idea of using  switch grass for ethanol he explained to me and I wrote down the  difference between ethanol from corn and ethanol from switch grass, and  why one   s economically feasible and the other one isn   t kind of thing,  and the names of all   when you have land, it   s the different pieces of  property are named after the person that owned them before you. So to  know what he would change if he were to make changes on changing  from wheat to pasture and how many cows you can run and all that kind  of stuff. There were times that I would get out my computer and have  him explain things in detail of what to do and how much land and all  that kind of thing.  A little bit about this house, someone told me to be sure and ask about  the stained glass.  Well, all the stained glass in the house Mom did, herself, and you can   t  see it all, but maybe we can turn the camera around because it   s  beautiful. This is kind of a scene of just farm life with the cows. And my  kids would tease her because the birds are as big as the cows, and she  said,    Well, you   ve got to have perspective, here.    (Laughter) Yes, but  she just really enjoyed it, and she did the front door, which is more of a  cut glass and around in the kitchen, there   s a big tulip light. She actually  made some church windows. She made a window for this, I think it   s  the   is it Kilpatrick center in Oklahoma City? She really got into doing  the stained glass. And later she taught my son, and he has continued to  do stained glass.  9  Finchum  McFerron  Finchum  McFerron  Finchum  McFerron  Finchum  McFerron  It   s very pretty.  Yes.  She did it here, or did she go to a shop?  Well, I think it was when Dad was governor the second time that she  picked up the stained glass. She took a stained glass class, and the story  goes that when she went to the class, they made like a little sun catcher.  She told the people to go home and for their homework to make a sun  catcher to bring back the next week. So Mom went home and the next  week she came back and she had made a lamp. The teacher kind of said,     Okay, I don   t think you need any more lessons.    (Laughter) She never  just did things in a small way. When she found something she liked, she  really got into it and did a great job. I was really thankful that she taught  Ben how to do some stained glass so that he could continue with that.  Did she have a work space here in the house where she did it?  She does. When Mom and Dad moved back in the    80s, they added on a  formal dining room, and they added on what we call the studio, and they  added on a greenhouse. And the studio is where she actually had her doll  factory for a while and where she did a lot of her projects, her stained  glass and ceramics and different things. But she had a great big huge  cutting table in there, and it worked out really well for lots of projects.  She was quite a project person.  After she died and I was cleaning out, she had fabric, just all kinds of  fabric, because Mom made so many of her clothes. The whole time she  was the governor   s wife and the senator   s wife, she was sewing. She  made her inaugural dresses. She made her inaugural ball dress. I know  she made the first one and the second one, I   m not sure   I guess, yes,  she made both of those. She made all three of our wedding dresses. She  made all of our bridesmaids   I know she made all of my bridesmaids     dresses. I can   t speak for Pat and Gail. And all of them were so different.  One of them had lots of lace, one of them had lots of beads, and mine  was quilted so it was kind of unique. (Laughs) And she quilted all these  beautiful flowers on there, and she made her suits that she wore to  things. But most of her clothes were, until in the later years, most of  them were all handmade. She did a great job.  And how had she learned to do some of the sewing?  Well, besides being a 4-H leader, she was a county   she wasn   t   in a  woman   s organization. I   m not sure     10  Finchum  McFerron  Finchum  McFerron  Finchum  McFerron  Finchum  McFerron  In a home demonstration club?  Yes, home demonstration club, exactly. I think in that age, you just grew  up sewing. Our clothes were made out of feed sacks, and I wish they still  made fabric feed sacks, but that   s long gone. Yes, I guess living on a  farm you just learned to do things more sustainable and do things for  yourself. We all learned how to sew, and I don   t make any of my own  clothes. I have through the years, but still, it   s nice to be able to sew  curtains or whatever home decorations you want to do. Of course, now,  my only sewing is we make hoop houses to go over our gardens.  (Laughs)  Hoop?  Yes, it   s a way to extend your growing season. It   s basically just sewing  a straight line, but then you put these tubes through it so then it can go  over the garden. It   s almost like an interfacing, but it   s a cloth that goes  over. And it   s really fun because when people come here to take the  workshops and we pull out the sewing machines, and especially if it   s a  husband and wife, we   ll say to the wife,    Okay, you use the drill and,  guys, you use the sewing machine.    (Laughs) And people, they don   t  even know how to use a sewing machine nowadays. It   s not even on  their radar screen so that   s kind of fun. Takes awhile, because they   re  kind of slow, but it   s funny to see them try it.  Passing on some of these good traditions.  That   s right, that   s right. You don   t want to lose those skills.  Okay, let   s back up to 1961 or    62, when your father decided to run for  governor for the first time. Can you talk a little bit about that process?  Sure. I guess I would have been in the fourth grade when he decided  because by the time he was elected, I was in the middle of the fifth  grade. We were in this house, and I remember we would invite kids to  ride the bus home from school with us. We would all have a friend or  two come, and we had a long table here that we had a system going. We  would stuff, stamp, lick, seal lots of letters to go out for the campaign  and all. We were very, very involved in the campaign. Of course, when  you   re that age, we had a station wagon, and we had kind of a bed thing  in the back.  It was Pat and Gail and I, and we had a friend, Koalani Han, because  when I was in the second grade, we had gone to Hawaii for six weeks.  Dad wanted to take us back to where he was stationed during WWII. We  took hula lessons, we went to school, we just became part of the  11  Finchum  McFerron  Finchum  McFerron  community for six weeks. We met this family, the Han family, and  Koalani was Gail   s age so she came to live with us that summer, and she  would hula dance at different events. I   m not sure why Dad thought hula  dancing in Oklahoma would be great, but that   s what we did.  There were four kids and it was quite a job, I think, for Mom to every  morning get us up and get us dressed and looking good and getting our  hair combed. I had long curls back then. I don   t even know if people  know what long curls are. (Laughs) But anyway, she would get us all     And as we went from town to town campaigning, it kind of got into a  scenario that Mom would drop Dad off on Main Street, and he would go  like to the paper to say that he was in town, and he would shake hands  on Main Street. Mom would drive the station wagon, and she would  drop us off at one end of the block and then she would go to the other  end, and two of us would go together on both sides of the road, we   d go  from door to door to door. We would have some literature or something,  we   d say,    Please vote for my daddy. He   s a good man.    And that was  kind of our key line.  One time, Dad tells the story that he was on Main Street shaking  somebody   s hand and said,    Would you vote for me,    he goes,    I   m  really sorry, I just promised this little girl I   d vote for her daddy so I   m  going to vote for him,    knowing it was the same person. It   s something  you couldn   t do nowadays, but it had a lot of impact, because we really  had a lot of personal contact with the people. And we did that in towns  all over the state. Then Mom and Dad would have somebody in a town  that had agreed to have friends into their house. They were called two-party  tea parties, and you would sit around the living room, and he  would talk to the group and tell them what his ideas were and why they  should vote for him, and they   d serve coffee or snacks and whatever.  And what did you girls do while they were doing that?  We just hung out. We were there. I must admit that we learned a little bit  of sign language. And we had strings. You know how you play those  string games? We played with strings, and I had jumping jacks, and I  always was playing with jumping jacks. I found ways to entertain myself  because the speeches got a little boring. (Laughs) We could pretty much  tell you what he was going to say. We acted like kids, but yet at the  same time, we were fairly well behaved, I hope. We had a lot of fun  because people were cognizant of the fact that these were little kids, and  they   d find ways to entertain us from time to time.  Were they one day trips, or did you spend the night places?  Oh, no. We   d be gone for quite a while, a week or two at a time  12  Finchum  McFerron  Finchum  McFerron  Finchum  McFerron  Finchum  McFerron  sometimes.  Hubert  Gragg was a wonderful man who opened his home  to us that was in Oklahoma City, or outside of the city. They had several  kids, and so we pretty much had standard rooms that we could show up  at whatever hours there and have a place to stay. That was good. I   m  sure there were other people that opened their homes to us, wherever we  went. I don   t remember a lot of them, but     And that was the days before McDonald   s was on every corner.  Absolutely. I don   t remember eating. (Laughs) I guess we did, but I  don   t remember. I mean, I remember   there were lunches, I guess? I  don   t really know what we did about eating. We just ate out, I guess. But  I   m not sure where. I don   t remember us packing food     No picnics?     or picnics that much or anything. I think that would have been too  much for Mom, I think, to try to keep. I   m sure maybe we did a little bit  of that in the car, but I don   t really remember that aspect of it that much.  Do you remember election night, the first round?  Very definitely. We were dressed up and fancy and all that stuff, but I  had remembered Dad saying that if we didn   t win this election, we could  lose this house. I mean, he was the first Republican, and I think there  was money coming in, but not like   you still had to have some money  yourself, and they didn   t have a lot of money. Somewhere that had hung  with me, and during election night, at one point, Dad was behind, and I  was crying because I thought my house was gone. (Laughs) But then  things turned around and before the evening was over, it was good news.  I remember lots of people and being excited. We   d sit in a hotel room  watching a lot of the returns until it got to a place where you could go  out and say that it was over.  And then you realized that meant moving schools, switching schools?  Yes, but I don   t remember that at that age concerning me too much. I  don   t remember. I was an active kid, still am, I guess, but I went to  Wilson Elementary, and probably two weeks after we got there, I   m not  sure of the time frame, but it wasn   t too much longer than that, I was  playing kickball out on the playground at recess. A kid threw the ball  and it fell between my legs and broke my wrist, and it was my right  wrist. I remember the teacher saying,    Oh, you don   t have to write  down, you don   t have to do this,    but then immediately, the other kids,     Yeah, she thinks she   s special. She   s the governor   s daughter.    So, I  would have none of that, and I just did everything that I was supposed to  13  Finchum  McFerron  Finchum  McFerron  do.  And then I broke my wrist another time while we were in the governor   s  mansion. I fell off a trampoline, which I had in the backyard, and I  actually broke both wrists at that time. (Laughs) I was a ballerina, and so  I actually danced in the Nutcracker Suite with a broken arm. My mother  made me a nice red, net sling to put around my cast so I did that. I was  always getting in trouble, I guess. (Laughs)  Well, when you moved into the governor   s mansion, did you get to pick  your own room?  Yes, but I don   t remember exactly how that came about. I don   t know if  you know the governor   s mansion, but when we were there, there was a  master bedroom and off of that there was a guest room, and then there  was Dad   s office, and then there was Gail   s room and Pat   s room,  together. They shared a bathroom. And then quite a ways down the hall  was another room that had a bathroom, and I got that room, which is  kind of surprising. Being the youngest, I would have thought that that  would have been Pat   s room or something. So I was kind of off down by  myself, and sometimes I would hear them laughing and giggling, and I  would feel like I was left out. Of course, that didn   t happen very often,  but I don   t know how that whole arrangement came about, that I should  end up with that room down there, but it worked out fine.  Any special memories from living in the mansion first time?  Oh, there are lots and lots of memories. Well, one time we went to do a  TV show, and in fact, they took my trampoline and I did back flips and  stuff on the show. But in the course of talking to us, I guess it was  around Christmas time, and somebody said,    Is there anything you want  for Christmas?    and I said,    A dog,    and as we left there, they were like,     Oh, no, we   re going to have a bunch of dogs at our doorstep,    but we  only got one, and we got a little dachshund. He was a fat little  dachshund.  Well, Dad thought we should name him Tandem because he needed an  extra pair of legs in the middle because he was long, and he ended up  becoming quite a hefty little dog. Tandem slept on my bed, and I would  watch TV with my head on the ring of a chair, I would lay on the floor  and put my head on the ring of a chair, and Tandem would put his head  on the ring of the chair with me. (Laughs) We had a lot of fun with that  little dog.  And back then, we had what are called the guards, but they were school  teachers and law students and medical students, and one older  14  Finchum  McFerron  Finchum  McFerron  Finchum  McFerron  gentleman. Most of them, a lot of them were young guys. They were  more like big brothers, and they had a uniform, but sometimes because  they   d be coming from school or whatever, they didn   t even have their  uniform on, and they drove us. They drove us to ballet and piano and  school and wherever we needed to go, shopping or whatever. They were  right there in the house. There was a place right at the front door, and  when we were watching TV, they were with us. I mean, they were just  part of the family. We really had a lot of experiences with the guards, a  lot of fun and have kept up with them through the years, some of them.  Like big brothers?  Yes, they really were like big brothers. They really took care of us and  all of that. We had a good time together.  Well, did you do 4-H, too, while you were there?  We did, and sometimes the 4-H meetings were at our houses, because  Mom was the leader of some of them. So, yes, and we stayed up all  hours of the night making 4-H dresses for the dress revue and putting  together our speeches for the speech contest and working on our  yearbooks that you, you know, record books that you keep. And we went  to 4-H camp. When we lived here, we went to Lew Wentz camp, and  when we went there, we went to Romanos, and Mom came with us. She  was a leader and cook at the 4-H camp so that was a big part of our life,  still.  Well, when you were living in the mansion was she the cook, main cook,  or did you have someone that     Oh, no, we had Polly. Polly was the cook back then. She was a very  good cook, and of course, they did a lot of entertaining. And Mom  probably helped do some of the cooking, but Polly was the main cook,  and Willie was the housekeeper. Willie Schranz was a real little, fun  guy, and he was kind of the house maintenance person. I don   t  remember even having gardeners, but I guess there must have been some  back then. I   m not sure, but yes. And Mom, she still entertained a fair  amount here. She actually had an indoor grill, and she would do rib eye  steaks, and she was a big entertainer. She was very good at it, having to  coordinate all this, which really, for her, it was probably quite a  challenge. She had thought she was marrying a farmer, and I don   t know  that she knew what she was getting into, and so I think it was an  adjustment moving to the governor   s mansion and having your husband  so out there and having to learn how to take on that role. She did a  fabulous job and became really a partner with Dad. Not in a political  sense, but in just a total support. I think that it made his job easier, for  15  Finchum  McFerron  Finchum  McFerron  Finchum  McFerron  Finchum  McFerron  sure.  Would you venture into the capitol very often?  I did. I was, like I said, an active kid, and the area behind the mansion  was kind of open at that time so I would ride my bike back there, and I  would go to Dad   s office on a regular basis. I was friends with the  people in the office, and we   d just go and hang out. I would take my  friends and really, I   m an explorer. If you let me loose, that   s what I do  is I explore. I knew where the library was. I knew, at the time, you could  go up these steps in the library and there was a door and you could go  out on the roof. And if you got out on the roof, you could go and sit on  the lions, and so I did that. (Laughs) Yes, I knew how to sit on the lions  on the top of     Unsupervised?  Oh, totally, totally. If people knew we were doing this, they probably  would have killed us. Yes, so I kind of just really did my share of  checking things out and checking out the neighborhood and knowing all  of the nooks and crannies of anyplace I go.  Knowing the capitol, that   s pretty cool.  It is, and later in the capitol in Washington, I used to give tours of all the  little nooks and crannies of that capitol and have been up on the top of  that where you can look down over the rotunda. Actually, we got  somebody who would give us a tour and take us to some of the places  that were unknown in the capitol so that was kind of cool. Like even up  into the very top so that was kind of cool.  When we had piano lessons, Pat, Gail, and I would all go together, but  yet we had time when you weren   t having the lesson. So I explored  OCU, and I went to the science labs and there were floors of OCU that  had kind of been shut off. They weren   t locked, but they were shut off  and they hadn   t been cleaned up and there were broken test tubes and  stuff all over the place. (Laughs) I just was always exploring things and  seeing what was around and getting locked out. I got locked out on the  balcony at OSU at the hotel and had to call down to somebody in the  parking lot and said,    Would you go in and tell my parents to come  unlock the door?    (Laughs)  Not too many dull moments.  No. (Laughter) No, if I   m left to my own devices, I   ll probably get into  trouble.  16  Finchum  McFerron  Finchum  McFerron  Finchum  McFerron  Finchum  McFerron  Let   s move into the senator years. Was that campaign much different  from the campaign for the governor?  Yes. By then, I was in high school. I remember I was a cheerleader at  Billings so I went to cheerleading camp and went to some other camps. I  actually remember at cheerleading camp leaving early, deciding that I  was missing out because I wasn   t being involved in the campaign like  we had before, and so then they actually came and got me so that I could  be a little more involved. But we were not that involved. It was mostly  Mom and Dad, and I don   t even remember doing that much in that  campaign.  It was already a known name, I guess, helped.  He was more known, so maybe the campaign was easier, and I think  they just didn   t want to totally infringe upon our   make our life any  more different than it already was. I guess when you   re teenagers, you  kind of want to do your own thing, and so we weren   t that involved.  Well, then that election night, do you remember much about it?  The Senate election night   no. Let   s see, he ran for Senate twice so I do  remember going back and forth between Tulsa and Oklahoma City.  Being at one and accepting, and then being at the other and accepting  kind of thing, and we actually flew between the two on some little plane.  I remember lots of people and the excitement and all of that. I think a lot  of the election night, until it   s announced, until you   ve won, you really  don   t go hang out at those places where all the people are, because you  kind of wait until you know something. Even though there was a lot of  excitement, a lot going on, you   re really not a part of it until the end of  it. Your moment of excitement is really pretty short compared to the  whole night. You   re sitting and watching and waiting, but you   re not  really involved with all the festivities.  And then when you actually moved to Washington, D.C., travel by air, or  load up the car and go?  No, we drove. We drove, and I remember a good friend had kind of like  packed a surprise bag so that there were things that we opened like every  couple of hours or something, and so that was kind of fun to see. There  were magnetic playing cards, and I don   t remember what else. I  remember one of the first things we did before we even went to the  house was we went to the grocery store. And why we did that, I don   t  know, because our car was full. (Laughs) I don   t know where we were  supposed to put all these groceries, but I remember coming out thinking,  17  Finchum  McFerron  Finchum  McFerron     Oh, what do we do with the groceries?     We lived originally in Fairfax, Virginia. I think they moved there  because of the school system, rather than being right closer in. As I said,  I had an excellent school, and then after I graduated, they moved closer.  They moved to   let   s think, what   s the town? Alexandria, and they  lived there for a while, and then in the end, they moved to Arlington.  They kept moving a little closer all the time. Several people on Dad   s  staff lived in Fairfax where we lived originally, and Dad would carpool  every day with people from his staff. They had at least three or four of  them that carpooled together so a lot of them stayed close because they  kind of had that contact. And then later, people moved, were in  apartments that were closer to DC and stuff. But when you go at first,  you   re just not too sure where to be or what to do.  Did he seem to enjoy that role as much as he had governor?  Well, if you asked Dad, he   d always say no, because he liked being  governor a lot more than he liked being senator. (Laughs) And he came  back and forth a lot so he wasn   t around too much. It was a fun time for  me, because Mom would be gone some, back to Oklahoma for different  reasons, and so I would go with Dad. I remember going to Peter  Flannigan   s house, who was in the Nixon office. I remember going to  the Japanese Embassy with Dad one time. I went to the Safari Club one  time. Just kind of getting to go with Dad to whatever he was doing, he  just made me kind of a part of it. That was kind of fun, and I would often  pick people up at the airport, and I would drive them around DC and  show them around. I was kind of a tour guide for people that would  come from Oklahoma. And I later actually worked in  Spiro  Agnew   s  office and gave tours of the Capitol and did that sort of thing. I really  enjoyed it, my time up there and getting to know that area pretty well. I  actually skipped school one time and went to DC for some reason.  (Laughs) I don   t remember what, now, but anyway.  When he decided not to run the third time and to come back, were you  surprised?  No. Well, that was in the    80s. By then, we were married and had kids.  We actually did go back to DC with our young children, really little,  right when he was retiring and participated in a few things there. The  kids were little. I don   t think Ben  McFerron  was even born, but Brok   McFerron  was a baby and Elliott  Wynne  was a baby. And we have  some pictures of Mom and Dad at the Capitol with the kids, and we went  into the Senate dining room with them, and so that was kind of fun to  have that last hurrah. But by then, I don   t think it had a huge influence  on our lives. It was strictly what he wanted to do and all of that.  18  Finchum  McFerron  Finchum  McFerron  So when he decided to run for governor a second time, you girls were  not around much to help with the campaign.  Right. And I actually, I never lived in Oklahoma as an adult when Dad  was in office. I had lived in Oklahoma and actually moved right before  he ran for governor. It was fun for us because we would come back with  the kids and stay at the mansion for a week every year or so and  sometimes have Christmas there. Our kids were little rascally boys, and  so they loved the guards. Now, times had changed a great deal between  1962 and 1980s. The guards now had their own building that was out  quite a ways from the house on the corner there, and they stayed out  there. They didn   t stay in the house. There were cameras all around the  grounds, which there weren   t before, and the grounds are bigger. That  part that I used to go out and ride my bike is now part of the governor   s  mansion grounds, and there was a swimming pool, which of course, we  never had. We had a bomb shelter. We didn   t have a swimming pool.  Our little kids would go out to the pool in the nude and stand in front of  the cameras and things like that. (Laughs) And they would go and bug  the guards and play tricks on them. They called them    peanuts    because  their hats had little tassels on the ends that looked like peanuts to them,  and so they gave them a hard time. But the guards gave it right back to  the kids. They teased them and had a good time with them so that was  fun. It was fun to come back and have that experience, and there was no  pressure on us. We were just enjoying ourselves.  And then once he finished that, he didn   t really retire.  No, and even before, of course, before the governor   s thing, he worked  with the Department of Human Services and worked with the Cowboy  Hall of Fame, and so he was still involved very much through all the  years. And then when he did come back, he taught at OU, he taught at  Central State   I guess it wasn   t called Central State  UCO . I always get  that wrong   and at OSU and did fundraising at OSU. He stayed  involved up until in his eighties, for sure. He taught at OSU, but he  reached a point   and I don   t know when the Parkinson   s actually  started. I think the first time anybody really mentioned it was when Pat  got married, and he was walking down the street and was shuffling.  People thought that he had been diagnosed with Parkinson   s and he  really hadn   t been, officially.  He did say to me that he needed to quit teaching because he knew what  he wanted to say, but the words wouldn   t come out, and so he found that  to be scary and frustrating. He had never considered himself a great  speaker at all. Then when he started having problems, then he really  19  Finchum  McFerron  Finchum  McFerron  didn   t like being in public and speaking because he was never sure if the  words were going to be there, though I think he continued to do a great  job. He had the most phenomenal memory. I mean, just even into his  eighties, people could come and say,    I live in Atoka,    and he   d say,     Oh, yes,    and tell you everybody that he knew in Atoka and what they  did and all this. He just was amazing with that knowledge and the ability  to recall names and people and how he   d interacted with them through  the years was just phenomenal.  People and Oklahoma were very important to him, it seems.  Extremely, yes, extremely important. That was always first, is what he  could do for Oklahoma, but never forgetting the bigger picture, either,  that    you may not like what I   m going to do, but in the bigger scheme of  things, this is the best.     Do you recall anything in particular that your mother spearheaded  while she was     Absolutely. She was  more involved  probably the second time around  because the first time she still had us to take care of and with getting  adjusted and all of that. And maybe I   ll think of more things, but the  second time around, the    Don   t lay that trash on Oklahoma,    she was  involved in that campaign. In fact, they did TV commercials with her,  and she would be in a car. And I don   t know whose voice it was, but it  had some deep male voice, and it was coming out of her mouth, but it  was like,    Don   t lay that trash on Oklahoma.     In a deep voice  It was  really, really deep. (Laughs)  And then because she had worked out of the home with her own dress  business and doll business   this was even before the doll business   she  really encouraged women to do home-based businesses. She had started  before Dad became governor the second time, having bazaars here at the  farm. She would invite other people who had made things to come and  have their things around and used the whole house and cooked soups  and things and had all that. People would come here and sometimes it  was muddy, it was kind of a mess. By the time Dad became governor,  the Bazaar had become too big for this house so they used the Harn   s  farm  Harn Homestead  in Oklahoma City. They had big tents and  things, and so I think every year, she had still hosted the First Lady   s  Bazaar in Oklahoma City and really encouraged women to do that  home-based thing so that was a big part of it. And then the artisans, very  much involved with that.  Still, I don   t know that she was involved with 4-H at that time, but still,  and helping. In the Senate, she did volunteer work, the Senate wives  20  Finchum  McFerron  Finchum  McFerron  work with the Red Cross, and they make bandages, different things, and  she was very involved with doing that the whole time she was in the  Senate. I think they met like every Tuesday and did volunteer work. She  also got into a business where she was refurbishing homes when she was  in DC. She actually, with three other senators    wives, Anne Stevens and  I can   t remember the other ones   Anne sticks out especially because  during that time is when they were in a plane crash and she was killed.  That was very hard on her. She really was supportive of Dad, but had  lots of her own activities going on and kept really busy.  Did they discuss politics around the dinner table?  To some extent. We didn   t shy away from topics, and Dad was always     I would have my opinion on things, and he was always a good devil   s  advocate because he would say,    Well, let me tell you the other side of  that story,    and really helped me see that there were two sides to every  story. I mean, there were some things that you would think,    How could  anyone see this in a different way,    and he would be able to show you  that there   s other ways that people see that particular issue, and so it kept  me more open-minded on things.  Even though he was busy, I always felt he was available. I never felt like  I couldn   t go and talk to him. One night has always stuck out in my  mind. I was downstairs watching Johnny Carson and Dad was up  working in his office, and I went upstairs and I said,    Dad, would you do  me a favor?    and he said,    What   s that?    and I said,    Well, there   s a city  for sale on Johnny Carson. Will you buy me a city?    (Laughs) It was  some little town, and Dad said,    Sure.    And that just showed me his  openness to listen. And there was a lady with a four-foot hat on the TV,  and so we sat and talked about what was on the show. It was nothing  important, but just that he was always available. And when I would go to  the capitol, I would go into his office and say hi to him. There were  times that if he was busy, I certainly wouldn   t interrupt him, but he was  never, never not available as far as I was concerned. He was always  around and easy to get to and considered us an important part of his life,  and so that was good for me.  Had time for being Dad.  Yes, yes. And I   m sure when I was younger there were times that we  might have been wanting to do something different. I guess the only  time I really think is we went on a vacation to Wyoming. We were  teenagers at the time, and that really wasn   t where we wanted to be,  horseback riding in the middle of Wyoming. We had some pictures of us  really looking mean, like,    This isn   t what I want to be doing.    (Laughs)  But I think that   s for all teenagers going on family trips that they would  21  Finchum  McFerron  Finchum  rather not be or whatever. But for the most part, I think it was a good  experience for me. And we got to do things that kids don   t normally get  to do.  There were Governors    Conferences every year, and they were in LA  and in Minnesota and in Ohio. And when you would go, they would  have activities for Mom, they would have activities, the governors  would be in meetings all day. Well, they had wonderful activities for the  kids. We went to zoos and to lakes, and we got to know these governors     kids from other places. Becky Love from Colorado became a real good  friend of mine, and we would be dressed for these formal dinners, and  we would be going up the down escalator. We would be just playing  around. One night, we walked in while they were dancing, and Governor  Brown and Vice-President Humphrey asked us to dance so I danced with  Humphrey and she danced with Governor Brown. That picture of us  ended up on the front page of several papers, so it   s not a rough life.  (Laughs)  It   s a fun life with lots of benefits. You get to meet interesting people. I  have a picture in the hall of when I was little. Actually, I don   t think Dad  was even governor yet. We were at a Republican convention, and I was  off exploring and found the room where Vice-President Nixon was and  got my picture taken with Vice-President Nixon. I was always finding  my own entertainment. (Laughs)  When it was time for you to actually cast your very first vote, was there  any discussion preparing you for that?  No, and I remember that first election very, very well. The voting age  had changed to eighteen, but they didn   t bother to do any redistricting to  take that into consideration. I was at OSU so you   ve got all of these  people who could vote all of a sudden who had never been able to vote,  there were too many of us for this voting location. It was midnight  before I got to vote. We all stood in this huge line, and they brought  barrels, and they put fires in the barrels because it was cold, and they  brought us food from McDonald   s or wherever. You got to where,     Now, who are you going to vote for?       Well, if you   ll leave this line,  and I leave this line, then that   ll cancel out the vote,    and by the time we  voted, the election had already been decided, and they had even accepted  before we had even gotten to vote, which was an unusual thing in  Oklahoma. You hear about that happening in Alaska, for sure, but you   d  think that they wouldn   t do that. And I think they   ve changed since then.  They don   t let them say they   ve won before we   ve even had a chance to  vote.  What election was it? Do you remember?  22  McFerron  Finchum  McFerron  Finchum  McFerron  Finchum  McFerron  Finchum  McFerron  Finchum  McFerron  I knew you were going to ask that. It may have been   I   d have to look.  Would it have been Nixon? I   m not sure. I can   t even remember.  I know mine was when Carter ran.  Oh, yes, yes. I honestly don   t know who it was, but I   d have to figure  out the years.  Do you recall one of the last politically oriented conversations you had  with your father?  It would have been during the Obama and McCain election, because he  was still alive for them. And I do know that after he voted, he walked  out and he told me one person that was a Republican that he did not vote  for, and I was very thankful for. (Laughs) I probably shouldn   t say who  that was, but anyway. I think I told him that I was registered  Independent. I   m not sure if he knew that so we really didn   t talk about  that. He knew that I was probably more liberal than he was, but he was  an open-minded person, and he was not as partisan as some people. I  mean, he listened to Obama and actually, he liked what he had to say.  He was very open-minded, more so than most people, I think, and really  able to see both sides of an issue.  He just encouraged you to vote regardless?  Yes, to be involved is, I think, important, to have a voice because if you  don   t, you don   t have a voice.  Do you have a favorite memory you want to get on tape of either one,  mother or father?  Oh, gosh. I can   t think of any right off hand.  Anything about one of them that   s not commonly known, that   s not  documented?  Well, one time we were, I think we were in Boston at some kind of  meeting or something and staying in some nice hotel. That would often  happen when we were going to places. And Dad kind of had his smirk  on his face. He looked at Mom and said,    Aren   t you glad you married a  governor?    (Laughs) which is one of the few times that Dad ever would  have said something like that because, of course, she didn   t marry a  governor. She married a farmer so it had its moments and its benefits.  One of the stories they would tell is that we had neighbors that lived all  23  Finchum  McFerron  Finchum  McFerron  around the governor   s mansion, in little houses all around. We didn   t  interact a lot, but they   d tell the story of one time I was talking to one of  the neighbors and the neighbor said,    I know who you are. Your dad   s  the governor,    and I said,    No, he   s not,    and so the story was always  that Mom and Dad tried to make our lives so normal that we didn   t even  know that Dad was the governor. That wasn   t like a big emphasis in our  life so I think it was really important. We came back to the farm a lot,  and I think that kept us really grounded, that it wasn   t anything special  in that way.  In the    60s, was Interstate 35 here?  I think it was about that time. Yes, I think it was here. But we, one time,  took at train ride to Oklahoma City. We were little, but that was our first  train ride. Yes, I think it was right around that time that I-35 came  through. One time, later, when I lived in Tulsa and Dad was   I   m not  sure what his position was at the time, but they had built 412 and it  wasn   t open yet. They were still in the process of building it, and so Dad  was coming back to the farm with us. We had a little Toyota, and he was  in the back seat, and he said,    Let   s take this new road.    So we did, and  then a highway patrolman stopped us, and here   s this big guy getting out  of the back seat of this little car, and when the patrolman came up and  saw that it was Dad, he said,    Oh, Governor, are you testing out your  new road?    (Laughs) We didn   t get a ticket or anything so that was kind  of funny. It was just   lots and lots of experiences.  What were some of his favorite places to eat?  Well, I remember him really liking El Chico   s, which was at the time on  23rd Street right there on the corner. There was also a restaurant called  Dorothy   s that was right on 23rd street that we used to eat at some, and  County Line BBQ, we ate there. But El Chico   s was one place that we  ate quite a bit. There was a Tastee Freeze then on the corner down from  the governor   s mansion, and we used to go down there and get malts and  things. We wouldn   t all go. Somebody would go and they   d bring them  back, and sometimes I   d say,    Surprise me.    I wouldn   t be able to make  up my mind what I wanted so one time they came back with a prune  malt. (Laughs) So that was my surprise.  But that just made me think, we often, on like Friday nights, back then  you could buy those box mixes, I guess they still have them, of Chef  Boyardee pizza, and we would make our pizza. We got into making  homemade taffy, and so we would make taffy and make taffy pulls. And  then we played cards. We played Canasta with the guards. This is more  of like me with my friends that would come over on a Friday night or  something, and we would have taffy and pizza and play around. That  24  Finchum  McFerron  Finchum  McFerron  Finchum  McFerron  was always fun. Played Blind Man   s Bluff. We did a lot of just normal  kind of kid kind of things.  Did you have to clean your own room?  Well, to a certain extent, yes. I mean, as far as the sweeping and dusting  and things, Willie would do that. It has a laundry chute in the mansion,  and we would throw our laundry down there, and that ended up in the  basement. We had Sunday afternoons, like once a month, they would  invite certain counties in, and they would serve cookies and punch, and  anybody from those counties could come through the mansion. Now, I  think, they do tours on Wednesdays. We didn   t have the house open for  tours, but we did on that day let people come through and meet Mom  and Dad, and those were always kind of fun. There were lots of cookies  and lots of good stuff.  Would she make them or would the     Actually, Kemp   s Grocery Store I think would make the cookies. It  wasn   t the cook that made them. They were catered in because there  were lots of them.  You mentioned that you had one or two Christmases there.  We did, and I remember one particular Christmas that all of our cousins  came. The third floor of the mansion back then was basically empty. It  was just a wood floor and just a big room so we would take cots up  there. I had a cotton candy machine, and we just would play up there and  that was a big, open space to be able to play. They spent the night  because Christmas Eve was when we opened gifts and things and, which  worked out later real well when you get married and then you can go do  something else on Christmas Day. It was our mother   s side that came for  Christmas. That was when we saw them and all so that was fun.  It was interesting because when Dad became governor the second time,  their anniversary was January 24th, and that was going to be, I   m not  sure which anniversary, forty-fifth or something, and we had decided we  wanted to have a surprise anniversary party for them. We wanted to have  a dance. They   d had the inauguration, they would have moved in, and so  we were going to have a meal on the first floor, and they would know  about that, and invite their closest friends and who they wanted to invite.  And then in the governor   s mansion, there   s a front big staircase, but  there   s a back staircase that   s just concrete, and we would sneak other  people in the back, and they would be up on third floor. And then we   d  have a band, and they   d have a dance.  25  Finchum  McFerron  Finchum  McFerron  Finchum  McFerron  Finchum  McFerron  Finchum  McFerron  Finchum  McFerron  Well, when we got to the inauguration and we were up on the third floor,  we were going,    It   s carpeted     I mean, the third floor now was a totally  different room. There was a bathroom up there, there was a kitchen up  there, and it had all been carpeted. So we ended up having to bring in a  dance floor to be able to have the dance up there. But we pulled it off,  and they were really surprised and invited all of his staff and everything.  So that was kind of fun.  So, now, the third floor, were there any windows?  Oh, yes, there are windows that go out. In fact, another thing that we  used to do when we were kids is when it got hot, you   d open those  windows and you could get out on the roof, and you could try to fry an  egg, or something, out there because it was metal. The roof was metal.  Not sunbathe.  We had a little bit of sunbathing. Not a lot of that, but a little bit. I think  I was probably too young for that. (Laughs)  Well, the Christmas tree would be where?  In the governor   s mansion, it would go in the middle of that staircase. It  was a big Christmas tree that they would bring in.  And your decorations?  No, I think somebody else. Somebody from the capitol, I think, came  and did the decorating, probably, with Mom deciding what the theme  was or what she wanted to do.  And family decorations would stay here, then?  Yes, I imagine we   d probably still put a tree up here. I   m not even sure.  Mom was   she did decorating and was good at that, flowers and all that  kind of stuff. I don   t remember. I remember going Christmas shopping  with one of the guards, Skip Beasley, because years after we left the  mansion, he called us and said,    I want to go Christmas shopping with  you. I miss that.    So he came, and we went Christmas shopping again so  that he could have that, we could do that. That was a fun thing we did.  Holidays, was Thanksgiving similar?  Hmm, Thanksgiving. I   m trying to think which part of the family we  saw at Thanksgiving because Memorial Day was when we really saw     Dad has a very large family. There were four brothers, but then there  26  Finchum  McFerron  Finchum  McFerron  Finchum  McFerron  were half-brothers and sisters. The Caskey family, his mother   s side, is  who we did Memorial day with, and that was usually here. They would  come here. I   m having a mental block on Thanksgiving. I guess it was  Mom   s family on Thanksgiving. I   m not sure. I   ll have to think about  that, maybe Pat or Gail know that better than I do. Well, I mean, Mom  makes fabulous stuffing.  That was my next question.  Oh my god, she makes the best stuffing  Unfortunately, there is  absolutely no recipe. It was just, you could just watch her, and she just  put it in and it was fabulous. So, yes, she made a big turkey and dressing  and all of that kind of thing. She was a great cook. She made fabulous  chicken and noodles, too. In fact, she owned a restaurant when she died,  in Billings. The restaurant was going to be gone, and so she bought it,  and she ran the restaurant the last couple of years. We had gone on a  family vacation. We were in Massachusetts when she died. When we  came back, we were in town, and one of their good friends said,    Oh, I  just ate at your mom   s restaurant,    and unbeknownst to us, because she  was going to be gone for that week, she had made up a lot of stuff. He  said,    I just had her meatloaf,    and he said,    There   s chicken and  noodles in the freezer for later,    and we said,    We   re getting the chicken  and noodles,    so we went to the restaurant, we got her last chicken and  noodles. And then a week or so after she died, we had her chicken and  noodles, which was really a blessing to have. She had a lot of special  things that she did, and she just was really a very good cook.  Did she make her own noodles for the chicken and noodles?  Oh, yes. Oh, yes, all homemade. Gail and her son have, they   ve kind of  mastered that, but I haven   t even bothered. (Laughs) It   s one of those  things that   s just kind of a great memory. I think we   re having chicken  and noodles for New Year   s Day.  Well, someone   s mastered it. That   s good.  Right, yes, as long as somebody knows how to do that. We make this  lime JELL-O salad. Mom just called it lime JELL-O salad, and since  then, somebody else that we know calls it green slime so we   ve kind of  adopted that name. (Laughs) I usually make that for Thanksgiving or  Christmas. And Mother made a dish that was corn and oysters. It   s just  regular corn, but with breadcrumbs or cracker crumbs and oysters and  some butter and some milk, and that was something that we always had  kind of unique.  She never complained about cooking. Some of us get tired of cooking in  27  Finchum  McFerron  Finchum  McFerron  Finchum  McFerron  Finchum  McFerron  Finchum  McFerron  Finchum  McFerron  the older age, but she didn   t. And to run a restaurant when she was in her  seventies was just amazing. She was very, very supportive of Billings,  and she was responsible for getting the museum. She got tours to come  to Billings, bus tours to come, and she had the restaurant, and they  would come to her restaurant, and they would tour the doll factory, and  they would tour some other businesses in Billings. She was extremely  supportive of Billings.  Had she grown up here?  She did. Yes, her family lived out in the country.  How did she get into the doll business?  I think just when she was really encouraging people to do the artisan  things. I   m not sure what made her do dolls, but they were not dolls that  you play with, they were decorative dolls, holiday dolls, Christmas and  Fourth of July and Easter and just angels and different kinds of things.  They were adult dolls, they weren   t kid dolls. She would come and visit  me in Maryland, and we would go from craft store to craft store looking  for the specific little things, different yarns and all of that. That was kind  of a fun thing to be able to do.  Where would she have to go to get her fabric? Did Billings have a fabric  store?  Oh, no. No, I   m not sure where all she got fabrics.  Oklahoma City?  Sure, yes, and you had to order by the bolts and stuff. So, yes, she had  lots of different fabrics.  Did she quilt?  She was not a quilter. She never got into quilting, and I don   t know if  she ever knitted. I think she did do some knitting, but I may be wrong. It  may be that she did some knitting. Gail would know because Gail   s a  knitter. I think maybe she did get into doing some knitting.  Did she drive? Some in her generation didn   t.  Oh, yes, Mom drove. And actually, Dad had a problem with falling  asleep when he drove, so she drove some for him. Of course, when he  was governor, he had a driver, which was good. And actually, during  campaigns they hired a driver because it would not have been good for  28  Finchum  McFerron  Finchum  McFerron  Finchum  McFerron  Finchum  McFerron  Dad to be driving. He probably needed to nap between places so she did  a fair amount of driving, and we drove several times back and forth  between DC and here.  That   s a long trip.  It   s about twenty-three, twenty-four hours so yes, it   s pretty long.  Maintaining two houses is a big job.  As we wrap things up, how would you like your mother to be  remembered?  Gosh, I think Mom was a very caring person. She cared about helping  people, helping other people to get going and doing things on their own.  She was a very down-to-earth person. She was who she was. She didn   t  put on any airs or anything, and she could carry on a conversation with  anybody and was interested in all people and helpful to people. I think  coming from a small town, it keeps you really grounded, and I think she  carried that groundedness with her wherever she went and whatever she  did.  And the same question for your father. How would you like for him to be  remembered?  Probably the same. He was what you saw, and he really did his job to be  able to serve people. I mean, he saw being in the governor   s or being in  the Senate as a way to help people. And he felt like he could help people  more there than in any other kind of occupation. I think for them, being  in political office was about service. It wasn   t about ego or anything  else. It was to be there to serve and to be there to cooperate and to work  together and to figure out how to compromise and make things get done.  I think that   s the important thing.  Do you have any particular item that was theirs that you cherish?  I feel so blessed that I get to live in this house, which is kind of a shrine,  still to Mom and Dad, all around. And I   m not a real item kind of  person, but I   m sure there are things that I just naturally have that I don   t  even think about because they are so much a part of   that if they were  going to be gone, I   d really miss them. And every day I interact with  things that are Mom and Dad   s. There are lots of times when I   m doing  things that I   ll think, first of all, I   ve become my mother in a lot of ways,  and I see myself doing things that she would have done or did or  whatever. There are still drawers that have all of her stuff in them so it   s  all around me, and I   m really glad. There are moments that I feel like  they   ll be glad that we   re doing what we   re doing.  29  Finchum  McFerron  Finchum  McFerron  I have felt, many, many times, felt Mother   s presence. Actually, when  Mother died, we were in Massachusetts, as I said, on vacation, and  someone sent a plane to come and pick us up. Well, first of all, we were  at downtown Main Street, and we went to the hospital. The men, my dad  and our husbands and sons, were out fishing on a boat so we had to call  them, and they came in, and they came to the hospital. As we left the  hospital, we were in two separate cars and everybody in both cars saw a  bumper sticker on this van that said,    Choose life, your mother did,     which was very interesting. Then as we were flying home, somebody  sent a plane and as we were flying, there was a rainbow and that rainbow  followed us for the entire way. Out my window, I could see a rainbow  almost the entire trip. We stopped in Kentucky or somewhere to re-gas,  but anyway, and then when we got to the airport in Oklahoma City, the  shuttle that picks you up to take you  to your car , the driver   s name was  Shirley.  And then just a lot of different  things . There was a day that the guys  were outside and we were here and lights went off, but not like the  whole entire house, it was just certain lights. We checked the breaker,  and it was like the dining room and the living room and the kitchen so it  wasn   t like it was one breaker. I thought,    That is really weird, just,  lights have gone off in just this part of the house,    and five minutes  before the guys showed up, they all came back on. We never knew what  that was about. And one time, there was a flashlight on the fireplace and  it lit all by itself so there were different things that happened that I  always felt it was Mom communicating. Just her way of staying in  touch, but that   s whether you believe people can stay in touch. Dad often  said that he still felt Mom breathing in bed for a long, long time.  I believe in things like that.  Yes, I really do too. I think the veil is pretty dim between.  This whole place has special powers, if you want to call it that, but  spirits or whatever, so it seems.  I was really glad about that when we moved back, and then Pat and I  started doing the retreat center here, Dad was still alive, and we tried to  really honor him. Most of the time, we waited, he would be gone to  Kingfisher and staying there when we had people here, but there were  times that people were here when he was here, and I   m really glad  because he thought we were a little crazy. He said,    Why would  anybody ever want to come here,    and he just couldn   t see why this was  anyplace to come. When people did come and he was here and we  would sit down and have dinner together, they would just say,    Wow,  30  Finchum  McFerron  Finchum  McFerron  Finchum  McFerron  Finchum  McFerron  thank you  Thank you for sharing your house, and thank you for letting  us come. This is so moving, and it   s just such a great experience and  such a wonderful place.    It was really good for him to hear.  Also, they would interact with him and ask him questions and things,  and I think, though he didn   t like to be put on display, I think it still gave  him purpose, and it still gave him value to be able to share his life with  people that came here, and I know they valued it hugely. And I think he  did, I think it was good for him, too, to keep his mind active and keep  him feeling like he had a purpose in life, because I think older people  sometimes feel like they   re has-beens.  And he was a farmer until the end?  Yes. The only reason he ever leased the land out was our cousin who  had farmed with him for twenty-five years, said,    I   m going to retire,     and so Dad was kind of, needed to make decisions. I   m really grateful  that that happened because that was the last year of his life. Otherwise,  we would have had to try to figure some of that out. Things happen the  way they needed to. But yes, he stayed active, and even then, even when  it was leased out, he would go with Jay and tell Jay how he thought  things should be done.  Continuing to teach.  Yes, yes. Absolutely.  Well, anything else you want to add before we sign off?  I think that   s about it.  Well, thank you for sharing today. It has been a pleasure.  Well, thank you.  -------  -------
