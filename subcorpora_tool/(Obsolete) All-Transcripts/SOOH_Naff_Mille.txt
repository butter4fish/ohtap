 Wilson  Today is August 1, 2012. My name is Latasha Wilson, and I   m with the  Oklahoma Oral History Research Program at Oklahoma State  University Library. I   m in Stillwater, Oklahoma, today, at the home of  Mille Naff, and I will be interviewing Mille as part of the Spotlighting  Oklahoma oral history series. Thank you for having me here today.  I   m glad to have you. (Laughs) I   ve been wanting to do this, mainly for  my children.  Well, I   m glad to be here. To start out with, would you tell me when and  where you were born?  I was born in Olathe, Kansas, on December 31, 1921.  Were you born in a hospital?  No, at home.  Were you the first child?  No, I   m next to the last.  Of how many?  Well, my mother had six children, but she lost two, so four. Raised with  four. Two older brothers and a younger sister.  What were your parents    names?  Charles August Hyer and Amelia Benade Hyer.  What were their professions?  5  Naff  Wilson  Naff  Wilson  Naff  Wilson  Naff  Wilson  Naff  Wilson  Naff  Well, my mother was a housekeeper. (Laughs) My father manufactured  boots and shoes. Mostly, my grandfather was the originator of the  cowboy boot, as far as we know. There is some argument about that, but  we   re not positive. He did have the first major manufacturing company.  He came to Olathe to teach shoemaking and harness making to the  school for the deaf. From there, he went on to start making cowboy  boots first, and later when he went into military, English style, also.  They were all custom-made. They made orthopedic shoes. So the cork  didn   t show, they put the cork inside the shoe, for crippled people. They  also made shoes for a giant for the circus, who wore a size twenty-two. I  don   t know what happened to that last. I   ve meant to ask and keep  forgetting, because I used to take my friends into the boot factory and  show them that last, which is about like that. (Gestures) (Laughs)  Was that a circus that was based in Kansas?  Ringling Brothers, I think. I   m not sure about that, but we did make  shoes for lots of famous people, boots. Will Rogers, among them. My  brother had possession of his letters that he wrote to the factory. I don   t  know what   s happened to them now. My brother is deceased. I suppose  some of his children have them. Of course, a lot of people ask about  Tom Mix. We made some boots for Tom Mix, but I thought we ought to  make them free for him. My family disagreed with that. (Laughs)  He could probably afford them.  They thought he could afford to buy his own, that they   d make boots for  somebody that couldn   t afford them. Among cowboys, Ken Maynard.  They made shoes for Dwight Eisenhower, and, goodness, I don   t know  how many others, but lots of famous people. Tannery said that only one  hide out of every thousand that they   d cure were good enough for our  factory. They used only the best.  The factory was based in Olathe?  In Olathe, and my father sold out after ninety-four years.  Wow, what year was that that he sold out?  Nineteen sixty-seven, I think, or thereabouts.  What was the name of the company?  C. H. Hyer and Sons. His father was Charles Henry.  6  Wilson  Naff  Wilson  Naff  Wilson  Naff  Wilson  Naff  Wilson  Naff  Do you know how people would place orders and how the shoes would  be shipped?  Yes, I should have a copy somewhere. They had a form made, and it told  them how to do it, how to measure their feet. They   d send the form with  a tape measure and all, and then they had the imprint of a foot. They   d  draw their own foot in that and then measure the ball of their foot, the  heel, and told how to measure. They guaranteed them to fit. If they  didn   t fit, they made another pair. The whole process took probably two  weeks. Of course, it took longer than that because they were assembly  line-type putting together. If they went straight through, it would take  about two weeks to make them.  Do you know how many people were employed there?  Toward the last, over a hundred. Not ever very big. My grandfather  brought a good many people from Germany, where his father came  from, for shoemakers. One shoemaker went back because he thought we  lived in a free country. He thought everything was free, which  disappointed him (Laughter) that everything wasn   t free. I knew a lot of  them very well. They were all wonderful men and families.  Where did your grandfather originally come from?  Illinois. His father, of course, came from Germany and landed in New  York. I don   t know exactly what got them to Illinois. Of course, there  were a lot of tanneries in Illinois, and they   ve all been in the shoe  business.  Even his father, your grandfather   s father from Germany? Was he in the  shoe business?  Yes, my grandfather   s father was a shoemaker, too. He was orphaned  and apprenticed to a shoemaker.  Wow. So growing up, did you help out at all? Did you help in the shoe  factory and with the process as a child? Did you have chores in the shoe  factory?  Oh, no. (Laughs) We were very spoiled. My sister learned to do the  upper stitching, upper tops, but I never did. I wasn   t patient enough to sit  there. (Laughs) I was extremely active. Of course, she is, too. No, I  really didn   t. My older brother learned every step and could make a pair  of boots. He   s now deceased. I think he taught one of his sons, but he  doesn   t use it.  7  Wilson  Naff  Wilson  Naff  Wilson  Naff  Wilson  Naff  Wilson  Naff  What was life like growing up in Olathe?  Oh, well, I couldn   t have asked for anything better. It was a small town  with all the advantages of a big city because Kansas City was right there.  There were only like two hundred students in junior high and high  school all together when I graduated from high school. It   s now (I don   t  know what the population) well over thirty thousand now and maybe  more. I think much more, but it   s kind of a bedroom city for Kansas  City. Although, when I say Kansas City, I think of Kansas City,  Missouri, rather than Kansas City, Kansas, because we always went to  Kansas City, Missouri, to do our shopping. Kansas City, Kansas, is more  of an industrial city.  Where did you start school?  Where   d I go to school?  Yes, in first grade or     Well, I started when I was five, I guess, and went all through the school  system. Kansas has a very good school system. I don   t know whether  you know that or not. At least, they did, and I think they still do. My  husband, who was raised in Atlanta, was always amazed at what we  were offered in school. We had music appreciation and art, and for a  little-bitty school, that was quite a feat. From there, I went to a girl   s  school in Virginia called Virginia Intermont College. It   s still in  existence. Of course, the government decrees no girls    schools or boys     schools anymore, (Laughs) but it   s still a very fine liberal arts school in  the mountains of Virginia.  How did you choose to go there?  Well, that   s interesting, too. We had a landscape architect working in  our yard who took an interest in me. He was thinking of Bryn Mawr and  Smith, but I was not a good student. I was a playgirl. I made a wonderful  choice. I   m so glad I did because I learned to study. It was quite strict  and a new world for me. (Laughs) I was a big fish in a little puddle, and  I suddenly wasn   t, so it was really a wonderful choice to go to school. In  this school, they were very strict. We couldn   t go downtown without a  chaperone. We couldn   t even accept rides home from church with  church members. We either had to walk or take a taxi.  Was there a boys    school nearby?  Well, of course, there were lots of them, not real close. There was  Virginia Tech, or VPI  Virginia Polytechnic Institute , and some of  8  Wilson  Naff  Wilson  Naff  Wilson  Naff  Wilson  Naff  Wilson  Naff  those schools. It was a Baptist school, and I was surprised they had  dances at all. I didn   t know it was a Baptist school when I went there.  (Laughs) I was an Episcopalian. Anyway, like I say, the whole  experience was wonderful for me.  How did you get there?  On a train from Kansas City. It took thirty-two hours to get there. Flying  was almost impossible, too. You either had to fly to Cincinnati and take  a train, or fly to Washington, DC and take a train so it was kind of  complicated. We went from Olathe, Kansas, into Arkansas, (I have to  kind of stop and think) Tennessee, Mississippi, Alabama and back. The  school was on the border of Tennessee and Virginia so we went back  into Tennessee after going across Mississippi and Alabama. (Laughter)  Wow. Were you alone on the train ride?  Yes, another great experience. I had a sleeper, a berth, not a roomette,  but a berth because it was, of course, an overnight trip. I had to change  trains in Memphis, not only change trains, but change stations, so I got  worldly experience very young. (Laughter) It wasn   t the first worldly  experience because when I was eleven we went to the Chicago World   s  Fair. Believe it or not, they turned me loose at the fair all on my own to  spend the day. In the evening, my brothers and I and my parents would  meet at a certain gate. Some days, my brothers and I would just   we  were staying in what was called Clarendon Hills with friends. We   d take  the commuter train from Clarendon Hills into the fair. My parents would  drive in later, and then we   d all meet and go home together. We even  took our maid with us. She got to go to the fair, too, and help with the  household chores. There were lots of us staying with friends.  So, was that in     Thirty-two.  Nineteen thirty-two. What do you remember most about experiencing the  fair?  I got to shake hands with  Guglielmo  Marconi and Admiral  Richard   Byrd. I think it was one of the first major cable cars. Rode the cable car  across the top of the fair. Three very wonderful experiences.  How did you get to shake their hands? Did you wait in line to meet  them?  It   s very vague. We were down on the lake. I don   t know how. I think I  9  Wilson  Naff  Wilson  Naff  Wilson  Naff  went to look at the penguins when I got to meet Admiral Byrd.  (Laughter) They were new. People hadn   t ever seen a penguin before  that.  What   s some of the food you remember eating at the fair? Do you  remember eating any particular food?  No, not really. Food wasn   t one of the big deals, except that the family  we were staying with, we had ham quite a bit. Then my aunt who lived  in Chicago Proper had us in for dinner, and she had ham. (Laughter) We  thought that was quite a joke. We did have picnics in the backyard, too.  The people that we stayed with, Nanette Todd. My sister is named after  her, Nanette Ferguson Todd. Her husband was a career military man,  and he was stationed there at the time. My mother and Nanette stayed  friends all their lives. Mother died at the age of ninety-five, and Nanette  died at 101, (Laughs) so they had a long time to enjoy each other.  My father was very ill with almost an unknown disease when he was in  his mid-forties. The Todds were stationed at Fort Leavenworth then. I  was very privileged, I think. I got to spend every weekend in Fort  Leavenworth, riding horses and going to junior hops. (Laughs) Their son  was a year older than I, and their daughter was a year younger. We  stayed friends as long as they lived. Unfortunately, our children didn   t  get to enjoy the same friendship, but we were friends. Let   s see. Her  parents and my grandparents were friends. My parents were friends.  There are four generations.  Wow. Was that family trip to Chicago your first big family road trip?  No. We had gone to   my gosh. I have to stop and think. It was one of  the major ones. We had gone to some lakes in Minnesota for the summer  a couple of times. I remember how beautiful the water was, and I caught  one of the first big fish in the family. (Laughs) They had it mounted. I  don   t know what happened to it now. It was around for a long time. We  moved into my Grandfather Benade   s home when I was ten. My nephew  is still living in it. He   s the fourth generation to live there. It   s on the  historic register in Kansas.  How long did you live there?  From the time I was ten until I married when I was twenty, so ten years.  It seemed like a lot longer than that. I loved it. We had fifteen acres. We  had our own spring and our own gas well. We had horses, riding horses,  and cows, all the things of a farm, but I didn   t have to do any chores.  (Laughter)  10  Wilson  Naff  Wilson  Naff  Wilson  Naff  Wilson  Naff  Wilson  Naff  It sounds pretty ideal.  It was. I was very, very fortunate, just very fortunate.  Do you remember your family feeling any different when the Depression  hit?  No, not at all. In fact, it almost came as a revelation to me that   I don   t  know whether I was blinded to it. Mother and Dad tried to keep  everything low key. Even though it was Depression time and I knew  people didn   t have as much as we did, I just never thought about it. It  just didn   t occur to me how very, very privileged I was, I guess because  I was so used to it. I don   t know. There were times when being the  advantaged girl was not an advantage because people were jealous of us.  In fact, after I was grown, the school started having all-school reunions  every five years, which were just like going to heaven. We had so much  fun because everybody knew everybody else in the town. It was like a  big family, almost, except, like I say, a few friends came up at a couple  of the reunions and said,    You were the sweetest girl in school and we  treated you terrible.    But I wasn   t aware that I was treated terrible.  Occasionally, there would be something that would buff me, but I think I  was just too happy-go-lucky to worry about it.  Did you have many family members living near you, like cousins and  aunts and uncles?  In Olathe?  Yes.  Well, all of my dad   s family lived in Olathe. He had three brothers and  two sisters. When we moved into my grandfather   s place, which was  supposedly out in the country, (it was less than a mile from downtown)  we were on the county side of the road. His brothers built houses across  the street from us, so we lived in a compound, kind of, and they were in  the city. (Laughs) We all grew up pretty close. Before they moved there,  they were in a compound on the other side of town. (Laughs) We didn   t  call them compounds, but that   s what it amounted to, so all of my dad   s  family lived close by. Mother   s family, her oldest sister lived in  California, and we never saw much of them. I knew her. Well, one sister  came, was a widow and visited from Kansas City quite frequently. We  were very close.  Were there many German traditions preserved?  No, not in our family, hardly any. I think most people tried not to.  11  Wilson  Naff  Wilson  Naff  Wilson  Naff  Wilson  Naff  Wilson  Naff  Wilson  Occasionally we   d learn a German word or something, (Laughs) but no,  we didn   t practice any German traditions at all.  What were Christmases like growing up?  Oh, wonderful. Santa was always very good. Had lots of fun.  Would the family all get together at your house since you moved into the  grandfather   s?  No, most of the time we had our Christmas mornings   each family had  their own. For many years, they   d take turns hosting dinner. The  brothers and sisters would take turns hosting the family dinner.  Nowadays, the children eat first, but back then the grownups ate, and  then we ate. (Laughs) It didn   t seem to bother us. We were having a  good time playing together and playing with our new toys, so it didn   t  make any difference.  Do you remember any favorite recipes or dishes that you enjoyed  growing up?  Oh, my mother used to make the best spice cake in the whole world. She  used black walnuts. We had lots of black walnut trees, so we had more  black walnuts than we did pecans, but it sure was good. It was made  with sour cream, and we always had plenty of sour cream because we  had cows on the place. Made our own butter, and we had cream so thick  you had to take it out of the pitcher with a spoon. I call it spoon-out  cream. Somebody said,    What in the world is spoon-out cream?    It took  me a long time to eat cereal with milk. (Laughs) It   s like a dessert.  So when you went to college, did you write letters home? How did you  communicate?  Oh, yes, regularly. I was all packed and ready to go back when I decided  I wanted to go to KU (University of Kansas) and transferred to KU.  (Laughs)  What year was that?  I graduated from high school in    40. It was    41 when I entered KU and  met my husband that year. We were married the following fall. The war  hurried things along. He was there doing his graduate work for geology.  After the war, he finished his PhD, and we came here.  What were you studying at KU?  12  Naff  Wilson  Naff  Wilson  Naff  Wilson  Naff  Wilson  What was I? I was an art major. What I really was interested in, there  was a store in Kansas City called Harzfeld   s that had the most wonderful  decorated windows for different seasons. They were so impressive, and  at Christmastime they had moving figures, and they were all dressed so  beautifully. I can remember that, so I wanted to go into window  decoration. Of course, no university at that time taught it. You had to  take courses in art and home economics, but I never used the career.  Did you end up graduating from KU?  No, I just had a year there, and then we married. Then I went back after  the war and took two more semesters, but I never did graduate. I took  courses here, but I never graduated.  Where did you get married?  Where were we married? We were married in my parents    home, in the  home I grew up in. Beautiful stairs, six stairs this way, and a landing  across here, and then twelve stairs down. (Gestures) The fireplace was  right at the base. I played wedding there. My mother kind of wanted me  to be married at the church, and I said,    Oh, no. No way.    (Laughs) I  played wedding on those stairs. She was glad after it was all over.  So how did you meet your husband?  He was my cousin   s roommate in the fraternity house, Sigma Chi  fraternity. I met him   I   m trying to think. I met him at Easter time when  I   no, I met him before that. I just knew him casually. Then when he  saw me, I was walking up the driveway of the Sigma Chi house to go  see my cousin, and he remembered me. Yes, I met him in the spring of  Easter, the year before, because my parents came to visit the school in  Virginia. My mother had a ruptured appendix and ended up spending six  weeks in Bristol. Then I drove them home because my father was still  recovering from his disease. Mother was unable to drive, so I drove  them home. Otherwise, I wouldn   t have come home for Easter. That   s  when I met my future husband, but I didn   t pay much attention. He had a  date with a girl that ended up being a sorority sister of mine. (Laughs) I  went to see my boyfriend, but we all were out together when I met John.  As I say, I was walking up the driveway of the Sigma Chi house to see  my cousin, and he was out washing his car. He said,    You going to  school here this year?    I said,    Yes,    and he said,    Good     I thought,     Who   s that?    I didn   t even remember him, (Laughter) but I did take an  interest. We started dating shortly after that.  What sorority were you in?  13  Naff  Wilson  Naff  Wilson  Naff  Wilson  Naff  Wilson  Naff  Delta Gamma. We don   t have a chapter here, but OU (University of  Oklahoma) has a good chapter.  So what did you do after you were married? The war was going on.  Well, yes, sort of. (Laughs) I worked. Of course, John was in basic  training for a good many months. He went first from Olathe to Wayne,  Pennsylvania, to Valley Forge Military Academy for his first training,  and then to Yale University from there. I joined him in Wayne. We only  had weekends together because he had to stay in the barracks. I lived  with a very interesting family. The father was commandant of the  military school. His wife was a dancer and a teacher. She had a  kindergarten in the mornings and then taught dancing in the afternoon.  Then in the evening, she went to the main line to teach ballroom dancing  to the debutantes, and I got to go along, and had lots of fun. Of course,  my mother   s family was originally from Philadelphia, so I had relatives  there, too, that I visited for the first time.  So did you learn dance moves?  I didn   t work while we were in Wayne because we were there for a very  short time. I worked in the mess hall. It was the freshman dining room  for Yale University, but it was turned into a mess hall for the cadets. It  was huge. I helped in the mess hall, and we fed three thousand cadets in  an hour and a half. I learned to cut pies in six pieces just by spinning the  pie pan. (Laughter) For a girl that had never had to do anything, I  learned a lot in a hurry.  Did you learn how to dance from the woman you were     I took dancing lessons when I was growing up, so yes. She had a young  lady (Gloria Stone was her name) who was studying ballet. She was  from the Dominican Republic. It was so cold when I got there on  January 1, and they put me in a bedroom in this great big Victorian  house that had been shut off from the heat. The mattress was like an ice  cave. I had to put on my fur coat before I could get any sleep. (Laughs) I  just couldn   t get the mattress warmed up. It was so cold.  So was your husband deployed? Did he go overseas?  Yes. He went overseas   well, let   s see. We went from Yale down to  Florida. We were in New Haven all winter and then went to Florida in  the summer. He was one of the top students in his class and was chosen  to go to the first radar school. Went to the radar school in Florida and  was sent to Bell Telephone Labs from there. He was in charge of the  radar on six B-29s in Guam and Saipan. They moved from Guam to  14  Wilson  Naff  Wilson  Naff  Wilson  Naff  Wilson  Naff  Saipan then back, after the war, back to Guam. So he was an electrical  engineer, as well as a geologist.  Where did you live while he was overseas?  With my parents.  And then when did he return?  Almost two years later. He was gone twenty-two months.  Were you able to stay in touch via letters?  We wrote every day. I have all his letters. When they were asking for  letters, I should   ve sent them to Washington, but I didn   t. We wrote  every day, and it used to run my friends crazy. If there was a span where  the letters didn   t come every day, they   d come four or five at a time. I   d  line them up according to date and read them one day at a time. They  thought I was   they just couldn   t believe I   d do that, that I didn   t rip  them all open and read them all. (Laughs) I said,    But then there is a dry  spell and I don   t have one     It was not too terribly difficult because we  were all in the same boat. All my girlfriends were home waiting, too.  My oldest son is six months younger than all their sons because he was  delayed six months. He was on the ramp going up to the ship when his  name and several other names were called to stay back. They were there  six months without anything to do. I don   t know why they kept them so  long.  He inherited a Jeep that some of the mechanics had made out of scraps  of Jeeps, so he enjoyed that until they told him he had to turn it in. For  what reason, I don   t know. They ran it off in the ocean. (Laughs) He got  to explore all of Saipan and all of Guam with his Jeep before   he tells a  funny story. When he went aboard the ship to go to Guam from Saipan,  he introduced himself as Captain Naff, but I think they thought he said  Chaplain Naff. The whistles blew, and they said,    Get the chaplain   s  Jeep onboard     (Laughter) I said,    You   re lucky you weren   t asked to  conduct services.    (Laughter) But he was very good and poised, so he  probably could   ve. Anyway, he got his Jeep to Guam and had it for a  couple of months before they took it away.  What do you remember about the war effort on the home front? Did the  shoe factory have many changes during the war, your family   s shoe  business?  Oh, yes. There weren   t many cowboys buying boots. They made a great  many, kind of a, Jodhpur boot for the navy people. There was a navy  15  Wilson  Naff  Wilson  Naff  Wilson  Naff  Wilson  Naff  base. It was the biggest inland navy base in the United States, other than  Chicago. They trained pilots there, but it also was a stopping-off point  for hospital planes. I don   t know why they unloaded some of them there,  maybe because they needed to get others moved first. I don   t know. I  worked at the navy base during the war for the little newspaper. I was  the art director of the newspaper. That was kind of fun. I enjoyed that a  lot. I was a volunteer for the Red Cross. They had a twenty-four-hour  canteen on the base.  Were you able to live at home and then just go to work every day?  Yes. I had one brother in the service who was a pilot. He never went  overseas. The other brother was a dairyman, and they told him he was  more important at home than he was in the military. He volunteered  several times. They said,    Go home. We don   t want you.    I think it  bothered him terribly that he didn   t serve, though. All of my boys but  one have been in the service. I have two foster sons, and they were both  in the navy. My oldest was a navy pilot and then flew for Continental for  twenty-seven years. My next to youngest was in the army. Adam, the  baby, was in the navy, so they are mostly navy. John was air corps, then,  instead of air force.  So what happened when he came home? What did you all do?  Well, he was already enrolled at Kansas University before he even got  home. We were able to buy a little house in Lawrence and rented out one  bedroom to pay for the payments out of the house. (Laughs) That sounds  impossible, now. The house cost nine thousand dollars and was three  bedrooms. Only one bath, but it had a full basement. We actually rented  out two rooms, and that paid the payments on the house. This house, the  original, that wasn   t there, and the dining room was a master bedroom  when we built this house. We built this house for  14,500 including the  lot, but it   s been added onto. We only had one son when we built this  house. We built what we could afford. We knew we were going to have  more family, so we built the house to one side of the lot so we could add  on to it. Ten years after we built it, we added that wing, which is two  bedrooms and a bath back there. (Gestures)  When did you move to Stillwater?  In 1949.  Did you build this house in 1949?  Yes. We came in January of    49 and moved into this house in August of     49.  16  Wilson  Naff  Wilson  Naff  Wilson  Naff  Wilson  Naff  Wilson  Naff  Wilson  Naff  Did you just rent from January to August?  No, but we did have students live in and work for their room and board.  They mostly babysat and did dinner dishes. I hated dinner dishes so  much, because I had never had to do them. They got up from the table  and they helped with it. (Laughs) That was the hardest thing for me to  get used to. I love cooking. I didn   t mind cooking, and I didn   t mind  housekeeping, but I hated getting up and having to do the dishes. I don   t  know whether they still have it, but they had an employment office for  students. I called and had wonderful luck most of the time. You figured  out what their room and board was worth, and then they did that much  work for us. It worked out very fine. Their main duty was babysitting  and doing the dinner dishes. (Laughs)  So you all moved to Stillwater because your husband got a job at the  university?  Yes.  In geology?  Yes. We   ve been here sixty-three years, and in this house   What were your first impressions of Stillwater?  Oh, I thought it was just a stopping-off place because, being a geologist,  I thought we were going to travel the world.  What was Stillwater like in 1949?  Well, this house was out in the country. It was on Lovers Lane. We were  the first house here, and the only street was two car paths in front of it.  No street at all. Orchard Lane was there, and it was paved, but  University was not paved past Walnut. There was a streetcar. They did  away with it just as we came, but it ran out on Fourth Street as far as  Walnut and turned around and went back.  So did it run on tracks?  Yes. There was nothing visible to the south except a barn about half a  mile away. Otherwise, you looked to fields all the way to the south.  There were three houses on Orchard Lane. Old families lived there: the  Simanks, Swanks, and can   t remember. Peyton Glass, he and his wife,  Margarite, and their son lived over here on the corner. They didn   t live  there when we moved in. The Earnests that had a shoe store here lived  17  Wilson  Naff  Wilson  Naff  Wilson  Naff  Wilson  Naff  there then. Peyton Glass and his wife, Margarite, and their son lived one  summer in this house while we were at geology camp in Colorado, so  that   s the way we got acquainted with them. They became quite good  friends.  As the wife of a new professor, did you have much interaction with the  university to start out with, with OSU?  Oh, I don   t know. When we came here, we were told that the town  people and the university people didn   t mix. I said,    Why not?    Said,     They just don   t.    I said,    Well, that   s silly.    We really worked to try  to   and Dr.  Robert  Kamm, the late Dr. Kamm, he recognized that  John and I had done a lot to mix. I use this as an example. One time at a  church meeting they were electing officers for something. I don   t  remember what. They said,    Oh, we don   t want to elect her. She   s with  the university. She   s only temporary.    I guess that was their attitude, that  they   d get established, and then they   d leave. The minister said,     Temporary? Temporary? We   re all temporary     (Laughter)  Things began to change, and they got to where they mixed more. They  tried to have a university club that never really took off. They combined  with the country club, kind of, and that helped get it started, too. When  they started building the country club they made it a point to include  university people, especially those that had tried to organize a university  club. I think we   re one of the few universities that doesn   t have a  university club. They tried. (Laughs) I   ve seen a lot of changes, but  they   re so gradual that unless you just sit down and think about it or talk  about it, you don   t absorb it.  Looking back over the years, what would you say have been some of the  most major changes?  Oh, gosh. Stoplights, first, and street paving. (Laughs) Like I say,  University wasn   t paved past Walnut until     And there weren   t many stoplights?  Not many. In fact, the high school kids sold fruit or   I forgot what they  sold, but they made money to put a light in by the high school, which is  now the center     The community center?  Yes, the community center was the high school when we came here.  They worked to get a stoplight by that instead of the city paying for it.  (Laughs) The only stoplight when we came   trying to think. It wasn   t  18  Wilson  Naff  Wilson  Naff  Wilson  Naff  Wilson  Naff  Wilson  Naff  Wilson  Naff  on Main and Sixth. Where was it? Maybe it was. Maybe that was the  first stoplight. I can   t remember for sure.  Did you go to businesses, did you shop at businesses on Main Street?  Oh, yes. That was the only shopping area. That   s one of the major  changes, really. I was sorry to see downtown go, and Katz  Department  Store  was the finish of it. It   s, of course, reviving, thank goodness, but  it   s not a shopping area. It was convenient, at least for me, to go  downtown instead of clear out on Perkins Road. I had the pleasure of  knowing Mr. Katz and his daughters.  What do you remember about him?  Well, mostly that he just loved to visit with people, and he   d sit on that  round cushion that they were known for. He   d visit with people and gave  the kids suckers. He always had a bunch of suckers. Just a very fine  man. He helped a lot of students.  How old were his daughters at the time?  Well, Helen was   I was very close to Helen. She was, I think, ninety-five  when she passed away. I still stay in touch with her son. He lives  between California and Aspen. He   s been battling cancer. It   s mostly at  Christmas that I hear from him. I had my granddaughter-in-law take  pictures of the restaurant, the Brooklyn Restaurant, to send to him, but  she hasn   t sent them to me yet. (Laughs)  In Brooklyn   s, it   s neat that they preserved the Katz sign.  Well, I didn   t see the sign.  It   s downstairs in the lower area.  Oh, I didn   t know that. I haven   t been downstairs. I   ll have to get my son  to go down.  Let   s talk about some of your hobbies over the years.  I think I was hyperactive. (Laughter) I didn   t settle on anything special. I  had such a wonderful childhood. I   ll show you a picture of it after a  while. The house we moved into had a pump house made out of  limestone. My grandfather put it in to pump the water from the spring. It  pulled the water as far as the pump house and then pumped it into the  house. They were one of the first ones to have running water in Kansas.  Anyway, when my parents took over the place, Dad had a hole dug and  19  Wilson  Naff  Wilson  Naff  Wilson  had the pump put down in the ground with big concrete squares and a  ring in it that could be lifted out, put a fireplace in that, and that was my  playhouse.  As I got older, there were two city reservoirs at the end of our pasture.  We   d ice skate on those. My friends and I would take hot dogs and  marshmallows and all and leave them at the   it was halfway to the lake.  We   d leave those at the little playhouse, build a fire in the fireplace,  come back to a toasty little house and have our hotdogs and  marshmallows. (Laughs) So, it was not only a playhouse. My sister  never used it. I don   t know why, but I loved it. Had slumber parties  there. My nephew, who   s done a wonderful job of refurbishing the  place, hasn   t done much to that, which is a disappointment to me. It   s  not going to cave in because the limestone is this thick, but the roof   s  bad. He has two children, but they don   t use it either, of course. They  hardly know it   s there.  Then in your later teenage years, you pursued a pilot   s license?  Yes, the summer I graduated from high school.  What made you want to do that?  Gosh, I think everybody wanted to learn to fly. (Laughs) My brothers  actually got a club started. They never   well, one did end up being a  pilot in the air corps, but he never took lessons at the club. I was  working that summer at the boot factory, so I saved my money and  signed up. My parents weren   t very thrilled about it, so I didn   t tell them  I was going. I didn   t story, but I didn   t tell them, either. (Laughs) I went  early in the morning because of the wind. One morning, my father went  upstairs to wake me up, and I wasn   t in bed. He was afraid I   d eloped  with my boyfriend, so when he came out to get the paper and I was  sitting on the back steps reading the paper, he was so relieved that I   d  been out flying. (Laughter)  I ran out of money before I was through. They said,    Well, you   re this  close. We   ll pay for the rest of it. You might as well finish.    So they  helped me finish. It was eleven dollars an hour which, now, is nothing,  but that was quite a bit back then. My instructor was a World War I  pilot. His face looked like a relief map. (Laughter) Wrinkles were so  deep from flying in open cockpits. Very interesting man. I was the first  woman he ever soloed, and, oh, he was so excited. He said I flew better  than a lot of the men he   d taught.  So did you do much flying on your own after?  20  Naff  Wilson  Naff  Wilson  Naff  Wilson  Naff  Wilson  Naff  Wilson  Naff  No, you know, we got married the next year, and it was just too  expensive. I just couldn   t afford to. My son, Peter, had his own plane for  a while, but I didn   t really pilot the plane. I just went flying with him.  I   ve heard about some other hobbies you   ve taken up over the years.  I have my scuba license. Swimming is probably my biggest hobby. My  husband used to say I didn   t have any hobbies. I said,    Oh, yes I do. I  have five children and you. That   s a hobby.    (Laughter) I stayed busy  raising children, mostly. The twins were friends of my oldest son and on  the high school wrestling team. Their father decided he didn   t want to  keep them through college, told them they had to move. Peter came and  asked if they could live with us for a couple weeks. I was pregnant with  Adam. I call them my triplets that are twenty years apart. (Laughter)  Anyway, they came for two weeks and ended up being here six years.  Oh, my goodness   We saw them all the way through college until they got married. They  were in the navy reserve, and they spent several months at sea each year.  What were their names?  Don and Ron Hudiburg. Their father was a fire chief here and head of  the fire publication, Everett Hudiburg. He   s a very lucky man. They   re  all marvelous children, outstanding. The twins were both teachers, and  his oldest son was a teacher. His daughter is extremely talented and  musical. She plays the piano and the organ and sings. She can play the  dulcimer.  Where would you go scuba diving?  Well, I took lessons at the university. The lakes were flooded that year.  We had a hard time finding a lake clear enough. I   ve forgotten now. It  was someplace over in Missouri that we passed our tests. Found an  automobile at the bottom of the lake and a motorcycle that they didn   t  know were there. (Laughs) It was lots of fun. Peter, my oldest son, did a  lot of scuba diving. In fact, two of the boys are also skydivers. They  said,    Mother, that   s the only thing you haven   t done.    I was eighty  years old when they said that. I said,    Well, you make arrangements, and  I   ll go.    (Laughter) But my legs wouldn   t hold me up now. They never  made the arrangements.  Tell me some more about your children. What are their names?  Peter is the oldest. His name is Peter Benade, my mother   s maiden  21  Wilson  Naff  Wilson  Naff  Wilson  Naff  Wilson  Naff  name. Emily is a family name on my mother   s side. Then there   s Tim,  John Timothy. All four of my husband   s grandfathers were John or  Jonathan. We were trying to steer clear of family names, not because we  didn   t like them, but because there were too many already. My family  didn   t know anything but Charles, Henry, and Bill. John   s family didn   t  know anything but John and Joe. When Tim came along, I thought,    It   s  terrible to have a boy and not have a John.    (Laughs)  Emily is second, and then it   s Tim, and then ten years later, nine and a  half years later, came Stephen Charles, named after both grandfathers.  Then Adam is an original name in John   s father   s family. They   re Swiss.  We have a picture. I   ll have to get it out and show it to you. Genes carry  a long way. We have a picture of Adam Naff in Switzerland in 1500,  and Adam, when he was working for the navy, took it to work and said,     Any of you know who this is?    They said,    No, but it looks like you.     It   s uncanny how much they look alike four hundred years later, five  hundred years later. I   m not quite sure where it is, but it   s unbelievable.  You   ll not believe it.  So you   ve added on to your house over the years, you were saying.  Well, Adam did a lot of genealogy, and he got it while he was working  on the genealogy.  Your house?  Oh, our house?  How it   s been added onto.  Oh, well, as I told you, we built it to one side because we knew we were  going to have more children than one. In fact, I was pregnant with Emily  when we were building it. Anyway, we added the two bedrooms and a  bath, here, good-sized rooms. We made the bedroom here into an  efficiency apartment for John   s mother when she came to visit. She  helped financially to do it because she said,    When I come to visit, I  don   t want to put anybody out of their bed.    She gave us a bulk of the  money to build on so she could have a bedroom. Then after the fire, we  just changed it to one big bedroom with office space at one end for John.  Then over the years, the neighborhood and the town has built up around  you?  Oh, well, we were the first house on this street. I   m trying to think. The  house up on the corner was second, then the one house on that side of  the street. The big white house that faces Fourth Street was there. It  22  Wilson  Naff  Wilson  Naff  Forest  Newcomer  Naff  Wilson  Newcomer  Naff  Wilson  Naff  Newcomer  Naff  Wilson  Naff  belonged to the Penneys who had a shoe store here. Then when the  country club was built, they almost built an identical house, only  smaller, out at the country club. There   s only been three owners since  they sold it. I don   t know the new people. I   ve never met them, but I  knew all the others pretty well.  Where would you do most of your grocery shopping throughout the  years?  Oh, at her father   s grocery store. (Laughs) It was called the Stillwater  Fruit Market. Did it almost all exclusively there. A little bit at Safeway  down there.  Where was that located?  Well, it was first located on Sixth Street down where that   what   s there,  Forest?  Well, there was Simpson Pontiac on that corner, you know, where  McDonald   s is, kind of that corner, so it was there on Sixth Street, just a  little bit east of that.  Then they moved over where the funeral home   s reception is on Duck.  Strode   s?  Yes.  Her parents were very dear friends, very close friends. In fact, we had  supper together, cookouts, at least once a week.  Would you say her name again on the tape?  Forest Anne Newcomer. We have two close friends named Newcomer,  and they   re not kin.  And went to the same church. It was crazy.  Yes, kind of a coincidence because the church is small.  What church is it?  The Episcopal church, St. Andrew   s. I think that they may have been kin  way back when, if they wanted to look it up, because Forest Anne   s  father   s family was from Pennsylvania, and Stan   s family was from  Pennsylvania. So they probably were, but not knowingly.  23  Newcomer  Wilson  Naff  Wilson  Naff  Wilson  Yes, that   s true.  Did you run for political office?  Yes, I ran for state representative in 1964.  How did that come about?  Well, there weren   t very many Republicans around, and I was helping  Henry Bellmon and a wonderful lady named Lee Head who has written  several books. She   s deceased now. Trying to find somebody to run for  state representative, we went all over Stillwater for everybody we knew  that might possibly do it. We were not successful. Then went to  Cushing, and the man that ran for the first time as a Republican senator,  Oscar, the Ford Company owner, Anderson, Oscar Anderson ran for  senate. Anyway, we were sitting here at the end of the day talking about  it, and as a joke I said,    Well, looks like I   ll have to do it     (Laughter)  Of course, I had gotten disgusted because the people we   d talked to all  said,    I don   t have time.    I thought,    Surely, you have time to serve  something that important,    because Oklahoma was in need of a two-party  system, very much. So my first words were almost,    I don   t have  time,    but I caught myself. (Laughter) I said,    Oh, I   m not capable of  that. I can   t do that.    They said,    Oh, yes you can. You   re smart enough.  You can read.    So I did it. Stephen was eighteen months old, and I   d  take him in a stroller in the morning and go out to campaign and knock  on doors and visit with people. I   d go up one side of the street for half  my time and come back on the other side, come home and fix lunch, and  go back out in the afternoon. Stephen would sleep in the stroller.  (Laughs)  I called on almost everybody in Stillwater at that time and even got to  Cushing. We took a month   s vacation during that time back east, and I   d  write letters to the paper about all the historic places we   d been. My ads  are in the archives in Washington. They asked me to send them. This is  terrible. I don   t remember her name, but  she  did all my ads free of  charge, and they were wonderful. They were quite different. I only spent  like six hundred dollars on my campaign, totally. There wasn   t any  money. The Republicans gave me a hundred, and two friends called   I  made a list of people that might possibly contribute. I said,    Don   t ask  for anything over twenty-five dollars because I don   t want to be  behooving.    They got five hundred dollars which was quite a lot then.  What was your campaign slogan?  24  Naff  Wilson  Naff  Wilson  Naff  Wilson  Naff  I don   t think I had a slogan. (Laughter) Just mainly that we needed a  two-party system. Everybody said,    Oh, you   re a Republican because  you came from Kansas.    I said,    No, I   m not. We registered Democrat  like we were told to do when we came.    (Laughter) I said,    I got home  from registering, and I got to thinking,    No wonder there   s no  Republicans in Oklahoma. Everybody does like we do.       So I got the  Democrat and the Republican platforms, and studied, and decided I  definitely was a Republican and switched over. This was kind of scary.  They asked me if I would be willing to go in our precinct and ask for  donations, see if they would be interested in changing their registration.  Wow.  It took a lot of courage. I won the prize for getting the most money. I got  ten dollars. (Laughs) There wasn   t a prize, but I got the most donations.  Everybody was just really wonderful. I didn   t have the door slammed in  my face once. Some people were actually glad that something was  happening. I felt like Mrs. Republican for quite a while. (Laughter)  Were you involved in Henry Bellmon   s     Oh, I was involved. Yes, I went to the state convention several times and  was chosen to go to the national convention in Seattle, but I couldn   t  afford to go. I had to turn it down. I wish I   d gone now. I wish I   d  borrowed the money. (Laughs) It was lots of fun. I enjoyed it while I  was in it. The first time somebody was ugly to me, it almost unglued  John. I said,    That   s just politics. Don   t worry about it.    (Laughs)  Who was your opponent?  Let   s see. Who was my opponent? Bob Murphy was Oscar Anderson   s.  Who was my opponent? Oh, gracious  He was an incumbent. Hesser,  Jake Hesser. He was kin to almost everybody in the county, all the  Hamms and the Hessers. I got 42.5 percent of the vote. My calling cards  were pastel, and when somebody wasn   t home I   d leave it in the door  with a note saying,    I   m sorry I missed you, and if you have any  questions, this is my telephone number.    I made a bargain with myself  not to go into anybody   s home, to visit on the porch or at the door, but  not go into anybody   s home. One woman wanted me to come in, and I  wouldn   t. She was mad at me, and she called me later and blessed me  out for not coming in. (Laughter) I said,    Well, I just thought it was  better if I didn   t go into people   s homes.    But mostly people would say,     Oh, I   ll vote for you because you   re the first one that   s personally come  and talked to us.     I guess I was a breath of fresh air. A woman and a Republican in politics  25  Wilson  Naff  Wilson  Naff  Wilson  Naff  Newcomer  Naff  Newcomer  Wilson  was almost unheard of. My parents came down for the listening party,  and my mother said,    You can   t lose no matter how it turns out.     (Laughter) It was fun, a great experience. We went to all the rural  schools, both parties together, and gave speeches. Of course, giving a  speech was pretty new to me. In one of them, I don   t know why I was  inspired, but I was inspired and some longtime county Republican said it  was the best political speech they ever heard. I don   t know what I said,  now. I know I criticized the county commissioner because the roads  were so bad getting there. Of course, he was sitting there right beside  me. (Laughter)  Did you stay very involved with politics after that?  Quite a while, yes. Then when the last two boys came, and two more, it  was just better to stay home and take care of children. There were seven  children all on a different schedule: Three in college, one in high school,  one in junior high school, one in grade school, and one at home.  (Laughs)  That would keep you busy.  Yes, it did. One thing about our children all going to OSU, staying at  home and going to college, they got a chance to know their younger  brothers, which they never would   ve if they   d gone off to school.  They   re all good friends. That   s when I was sorry that they didn   t have  the opportunity to go off, but as it turned out, it was kind of a blessing.  Peter wrestled for OSU. Ronnie was on the team, too.  So you could go cheer him on.  Oh, yes  Everybody still talks about it. I sat on the floor, right up close  to the mat until the fire department made me quit doing it. (Laughter) I  didn   t know how to sit in a chair.  Now I go with you and the coach says the same things that you do. She  really knows wrestling.  Of course, Anne is just a year younger than Peter. She   s between Peter  and Emily. They   re almost like brothers and sisters. She also has twin  brothers.  Yes.  Is there anything else you   d like to talk about, about how Stillwater has  changed over the years?  26  Naff  Newcomer  Naff  Wilson  Naff  Newcomer  Naff  Wilson  Naff  Well, yes, but I need prompting. (Laughter) Like I say, it   s so gradual,  but it   s changed immensely. This was country. Actually, from Walnut on  out, it was country.  Twelfth Street was just back and beyond.  Just before we built our house, the Ducks owned all this land. It was all  farmland.  And then the highway to Oklahoma City.  Oh, when we moved here, that was just a dirt road. The highway didn   t  come in until, what?  I don   t know. We   d go on old 77, and you go through Mulhall and     They first rocked it, and then they tarred it. With the clay and rock, it  made kind of a blacktop road. Then the highway came, what, thirty years  ago, I guess, about thirty years ago. Our street wasn   t paved until   it  wasn   t paved when Stephen was born. Dates escape me. (Laughs)  And then there   s been a lot of changes at OSU.  Oh, yes, absolutely. The Geology Department was in a Quonset hut  when we came here. My husband was one of the first ones to be hired.  Dr.  V. Brown  Monnett, whose father  Victor Elvert Monnett  was head  of the department at OU, was hired as head of the department. Mr.   Hobart  Stocking taught geology, but I don   t know how much geology  he studied. He was a Christian missionary for many years. Dr. Stocking  was here and taught mineralogy. So, of course, when they opened the  Geology Department, they both came into the Geology Department.  John was the first one hired besides them. Alex Ross came right after  that.  This is not in the history of the Geology Department, and I will not say  why. I know why. John   s name was left out completely on the field  camp, and he   s the one that suggested it. He suggested that OU be in on  it with us, which they were. For many years, they leased the land in  Ca  on City  Colorado . Alex Ross helped build most of the cabins, and  more or less took over the camp because it was necessary for all of us to  have another job in the summertime to make ends meet. John could  work with the electronics lab. They were glad to have him there in the  summer, the rocket firing lab that   s no longer here. He worked there and  gave up his time at the field camp to Alex, but he   s the one that  suggested it and helped find the land and dug some of the ditches for the  sewage system. (Laughs)  27  Wilson  Naff  Joe Greene  Naff  Wilson  Newcomer  Naff  Wilson  Naff  Wilson  Naff  Wilson  Naff  Wilson  Naff  When did John retire?  Nineteen eighty-two, I think. Eighty-one.  It was the year I went to work for the post office, so it was    81.  He took early retirement, just a year, I think. He was Outstanding  Professor four times. They still talk about him.  Did he have Boone Pickens as a student?  Yes he did. He had Boone Pickens as a student.  Yes, he had such a wonderful memory. He called roll by the roll call that  they gave him from the registrar   s office the first day. The next day, he  could go in and call roll and tell them where they were sitting the day  before. For a long time, he fought having big classes. He had a couple  with over a hundred or more in it, and he could still do that. Fantastic  memory.  Boone Pickens is probably his     Oh, yes, he   s one of   yes, we   re still good friends. We were fortunate  enough to be invited to Boone   s fiftieth birthday party out in Amarillo.  That was quite an affair. (Laughs)  Oh, I bet.  Yes, Boone and I still stay in touch. Not daily or weekly, but    And then  Herb Davis, who is a very fine alum, was responsible for the presidential  scholarship in John   s and my name. He   s the one that did all the work  for that. We   re most grateful for it. He   s done a lot for the department,  too. Doesn   t have as much money, but has done equally as much work,  I   d say, for what he has.  What was his name?  Herb Davis. They live in Edmond. Herb and Shirley Davis. They   re very  dear friends, and stayed friends.  What does Oklahoma mean to you?  It   s home  (Laughs) I   m very proud of Oklahoma. I think it   s wonderful.  It   s come a long, long way. Fought drought and Depression like  everybody else, but it hit here and Kansas harder than almost any place.  28  Wilson  Naff  Wilson  Greene  Naff  Wilson  Naff  Wilson  Naff  Wilson  Naff  They just fought it out.  It takes strong people.  I think both Oklahoma and Kansas have the record for people living the  longest. I   m not sure about that, but I think so. Longer lives. We   re not  as polluted as some states. (Laughter) Kansas has very little industry,  and neither does Oklahoma. They   ve stayed, a great deal, farm.  Is there anything else that anyone would like to bring up?  The mountain climbing that you and John did.  Oh, yes, we traveled all over the United States with the children. They  saw most of the forty-eight before they left home. We camped out. One  summer, the summer I ran for office, Stephen was eighteen months old,  and we went from here through Arkansas and down through Tennessee  and up the coast. We were gone a month, and we only spent four  hundred dollars. (Laughter) That kind of gasoline. Our car caught on fire  in Virginia, and we had to get a new axle, and that even included the  axle. (Laughter) It happened close to where I went to school in Virginia.  Well, that   s a good education for kids.  Yes, yes. We had a real good system. Peter and John would set up the  tent, Emily and Tim would blow up the air mattresses, and I   d fix  dinner. Then we   d do it in reverse, leaving in the morning. We didn   t  travel very far each day because there was too much to see, but we went  all the way to Nova Scotia, clear to the top of Nova Scotia and back  through Buffalo, New York, and Niagara Falls and then over to Detroit  and down through Detroit to St. Louis and Kansas City and then here.  What kind of car were you driving?  Chevrolet station wagon.    See the USA in your Chevrolet     (Sings)  (Laughter)  Sounds like you did.  Oh, it was fun. It was my creation. I   m going to take the credit for this. I  had John build a platform. We folded the back seat down, and the  platform was high enough for our suitcases to fit under, and the ice chest  and the picnic basket. We put the ice chest and the picnic basket behind  the front seats. Then we put a mattress over all the rest. The platform  opened up, hinged, just big enough to open up the picnic basket and the  ice chest so I could get to it to make sandwiches and get drinks. Then the  29  Wilson  Naff  other end folded up over the main part so we could set it out if we  needed to. We could get our bags in and out. They could sit back there  and play games and color, but there was so much to see on the East  Coast, and so many things.  We visited old military friends, and I still stay very close in touch with  one of our military friends. Oh, that   s another thing. When we moved  here, Mrs. Monnett thought I should write a book about the people that  had lived with us because when we were in the service in Florida, John  brought four bachelor officers home for dinner one night. It took me all  day to cook. (Laughs) I   d not done much cooking at that time. That   s  when we moved from Connecticut to Florida. We had a wonderful  apartment. We lived right on the beach. It cost seventy-five dollars a  month. What the poor man that owned it didn   t know was he couldn   t  put us out when season came. The government wouldn   t let him. He got  about  750 in season for the apartments. It was a three-room, but  everything made into a bed. There was just a little kitchenette. Two  bedrooms, a living room and a bedroom and two bathrooms and a  kitchenette. Anyway, John brought these four fellows home, and two of  them liked it so well they just stayed. (Laughter) They just lived with us  for nine months while we were in Florida and slept in the living room.  Did you cook for them regularly after that?  Yes, they had to be on the base at four o   clock in the morning, so I got  up at three and fixed breakfast for them. I really learned in a hurry. Of  course, we had rationing stamps. I, finally, when it was almost all over,  said,    Have your mother send her rationing stamps to me  I   m the one  that needs them     (Laughter) And they did. Sugar and oil was the main  thing. I used what bacon I could get. I cooked and saved the grease and  used it, and still do. I made hot biscuits from scratch at three o   clock in  the morning. (Laughs) Even eggs were hard to come by. You would  think in Florida there   d be plenty of fresh fruit, but there wasn   t. They  shipped it all out. I thought we   d just live on fresh fruit, but we didn   t.  When we ran out of money at the end of the month, the lieutenants paid  us two hundred dollars. Seventy five dollars of that went to live in the  house, and then groceries. There wasn   t an awful lot left. (Laughs) But  when we ran out at the end of the month, I   d tell the two fellows,    Okay,  you have to take us out to dinner,    which they did. (Laughter) The four  men that were there, we all spent all our time together. Some of the other  wives said,    Which one of those fellows is your husband?    (Laughter)  One of them looked an awful lot like John, and I started to tell her that I  couldn   t    (Laughter)  From there, when we left Florida, a man named Victor Annigan drove to  30  Wilson  Naff  Newcomer  Kansas with us. John was stationed in Salina, Kansas, briefly. Victor  Annigan sounds Irish, but he was Turk. (Laughter) He drove with us.  We went from Salina to Great Bend, and another bachelor officer came  for dinner, and he stayed with us the rest of the time we were in Great  Bend. He slept on a cot in the kitchen. (Laughs) Louis, whose wife I   m  still in touch with in Baltimore, we stayed close friends. Camped  together and did a lot of things together from the war on.  One time, they were here visiting, and we were sitting here. We were out  on the patio, and we were talking. The phone rang, and it was Phil  Crane, the other one that lived with us in Florida, and his wife. They  were on their way through. I wondered if they were killed in an accident  or something. Never heard from them again. We had a good time.  Nobody got mad at anybody. I sent them a Christmas card, and it came  back, so that   s the only thing I can think of is that they were in an  automobile accident because we never heard from them again.  Well, it sounds like you   ve been quite hospitable over the years.  Well, yes. (Laughs) Of course, since then, we   ve had a Korean boy live  with us, a Japanese boy live with us. Two Arabs stayed here when the  Shah was being ousted. One night, we sat up until four o   clock in the  morning discussing the politics of Iran. I told them they were going to be  sorry they kicked the Shah out. About a year after they moved, they  called me and said,    You   re right.    (Laughter) Let   s see. Who else? The  other Newcomer family lived with us for six weeks. We had just  finished that wing, and they had a chance to sell their house, and they  were in the throes of building a new house. Anita came and said,    Could  we possibly stay in your new bedroom for a while until our house is  finished?    (Laughs) I said,    Well, you can stay unless John   s mother  decides to come, and she has first priority.    Six weeks later, she decided  to come.  Everybody at the church thought we were going to be   well, they  thought we were both out of our minds and we   d never be friends again.  We were better friends. I have fond memories. They lined cots, we had  twin beds in there. They lined cots for their four children against the  wall. There was nothing but a hot plate in there, but I said,    I don   t want  the walls all greasy before John   s mother       They said,    Oh, well we  won   t cook in there. We   ll make oatmeal, or we   ll just eat cereal.    She  fixed sandwiches to take to school for lunch for the children and for  herself. We had them to dinner more than we didn   t have them. Just had  a real fine time. The children got along all right. Emily and Nancy        Can Nancy spend the night?       She is spending the night     (Laughter)  You   ve had a few baseball teams stay here.  31  Naff  Wilson  Naff  Newcomer  Wilson  Naff  Wilson  Naff  Newcomer  Naff  Wilson  Naff  Newcomer  Yes, we   ve had several baseball teams stay for the tournaments. Four  boys, two times from North Carolina and one from Tennessee, I think.  They were all fun. I told them they only knew how to turn the switch  one way, and that was up. They never turned out a light. I was going  behind them turning out lights. (Laughter)  I   m sure you   ve given a lot of people a good impression of Stillwater.  Well, I hope so. I hope I have. I love entertaining and have done a lot of  entertaining. My children laugh. They say I   m in my element when I   m  entertaining. Homecoming last year, all the children were here. Not all  the grandchildren. I have twenty-two grandchildren and twenty-four and  twenty-five will be here in October, (Laughter) great-grandchildren.  We had a ball last year.  And did any of your children graduate from OSU?  Peter did, and the twins. Adam just went three semesters and goofed.  (Laughs) He   s smart, but he wasn   t interested. Emily never graduated,  but she almost finished at KU before she married. She could   ve finished,  I think, but she didn   t. Stephen finished internet. He got his degree on  the internet. I   m real proud of him. That takes a lot of discipline.  Yes. Do you have any grandkids at OSU yet?  Let   s see. Yes. Natalie, and Stacy went here a little while. Natalie is the  only one, I think, isn   t she?  I can   t think of anyone else.  Natalie is the only one that graduated from here. My daughter lives in  California. Stephen lives in Salt Lake, and Peter lives in Memphis, did  live in Houston. His son said his girls are going to OSU. He loves OSU.  He didn   t go to college. His wife is a college graduate. Her family came  to the States from Colombia, South America. Brilliant girl and charming  as can be. I   m very lucky with in-laws, for the most part. Adam and  Angela keep foster children.  Well, I really appreciate you visiting with me today.  I appreciate what you   re doing. It   ll all be in the university library.  Oh, how nice. That   s wonderful.  32  Wilson Yes.  -------  -------
